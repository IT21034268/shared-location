5,A girl is sent to many concentration camps and tells.,"I love this book. It is my favorite. I have read it 17 times. It is about a teenage girl who is separated from her father and brother and is then sent to a ghetto. From there, she goes to about 5-6 camps. She lives in hard living conditions with beatings and riots. Her mother becomes sick, and she must smuggle her out. This story also tells of how they were saved and her new live. I highly reccommed this for all young aldut readers. I could put it down."
5,Holocaust to the Max.,"This book is true story about a girl who went to Aushwitz. It really explains everything that the jewish people went through to survive (many times did this girl escape death by an inch).If you're a holocaust expert or are just getting started, this is a great book for you!enjoy!"
5,Touching! *wipes tears*,"This book is wonderful for anybody interested in learning about the holocaust. But the thing is, I don't really feel it works as a ""reading just 'cause I feel like it"" book for preteen agers like me. It can get quite graphic at times and the fast paced action goes on and off, leading a few kids frustrated because they want to know what happens instead of her thoughts.I personally loved it. The book has a very intense feeling that can move a person to tears, and a lot of kids will find out just how horrifyingly cruel humans can be. Children also get the chance to hear the Holocaust from a child's point of view, instead of history textbook writers that only go by facts they never experienced. I know I liked the book better than textbooks because I was able to relate thoughts from her that I have sometimes."
4,"Ashley H., Miller Place N.Y.","The book I Have Lived A Thousand Years:Growing Up In The Holocaust by Livia Bitton-Jackson is about a thirteen year old girl named Elli Friedmann who grew up during the holocaust. Elli is sent to a contruction camp named Auschwitz. There they make her shave her head and strip her clothes, Elli is in rags and worked hard everyday. This book has so much emotion because the struggles she goes through. I loved this book because it made me feel greatful for my life. Read this book and see if Elli makes it out of the camp alive and to see what people like them had to go through because of their religon."
2,Not what I expected from a Suunto,"Pros:-Looks nice (I receive a lot of compliments)-Heart rate monitor is comfortable, unobtrusive, and very accurate-Lots of heart rate training modesCons:-Cheap plastic face that scratches very easily-The clasp on the band constantly pops open-The buttons stick out so far that every time you bend your wrist back or bump your arm the watch changes to a different mode. This happens CONSTANTLY and is extremely irritating.-It is very complicated to try to figure out all the different training modes-No compass or altimeter settings that are common on most other Suunto watchesBottom line:Suunto has been making great watches for long enough that they should have been able to avoid the mistakes they made when designing this watch. This watch is definitely overpriced for the product that you get. If your looking for a good heart rate monitor you can find models by Polar with all the same features of the T3 for about half the price."
3,Suunto T3,"I did not like the watch band on this watch, i cut it too small when i got it and had to buy a new adjustable band. And the band from the HR strap fell off, so i had to get another one of those too. The split numbers on the watch are really small and hard to read when you are running fast. THe HR seems to be alot more accurate and is very easy to read. The HR band is alot better than other ones i have used, my Timex one ripped twice. Overall its a good product."
3,A flawed gem,"The heart rate etc. functionality of this watch is terrific, if extremely complicated.Any of the other T3 options would probably get *****, but I'm giving this *** because of the strap.The clasp pops open all the time.It's disproportionately expensiveHandlebar mounting is now impossible! (but the bike pod works really well)Keeps pulling hairs out of my wristI'm going to invest another $20 and get one of the cheaper straps. That really defeats the purpose, doesn't it!"
2,Battery Issues,"Batteries would die in about a month.Not intuitive button patterns to operate...as in starting, setting, clearing workouts...never got to the point I could do it without thinking.Replaced this with a Timex HRM; much happier."
2,scrrratched,"had to switch bands , standard band had patent leather look to it. scratched from day one. i can't understand why a $150 sport watch would not come with a mineral crystal face . i've had $50 nike watches that were scratch proof. after changing the band the watch is pretty functional and cool looking, but still can not replace the convenience or functionality of a mounted computer for biking."
1,Its a piece of....,"Face is made of cheap plastic - it scratched within an hour of putting it on. Watch had about 20 scratches and dimples after 2 weeks. I've been wearing a cheap Casio for the last two years that hardly has a scratch on it. Other problems include- the buttons press very easily making the watch change functions constantly, for example when I put my hand in my pocket or put on a coat; also, the functionality of the watch is not very intuitive, with five buttons it should be much easier to move through the different functions of the watch. Finally, the watch is very well photographed in the ad, and doesn't look any nicer than my cheap casio in reality."
3,Not for Toddlers,"What do I know. I bought this as an accessory for the M&D Foldup House. Unfortunately, once I got it, I discovered it has small parts not appropriate for 3 year olds. Don't remember it being highlighted on site so hence this note. Am returning it. Looks very nice though."
4,another good doll house addition,These accessories fall right into the same category as the rest of Melissa and Doug's doll house stuff. Well made and creative.
1,"Very, very disappointing","This book is nothing more than a poorly written re-hash of the work of others.The book ignores many key influences on quality. For example, there is very little discussion of requirements management, or the development and management of real test suites. There is no real discussion of testing tools. There is also virtually no discussion of real problems that affect testing (e.g. scope changes or loss of information). Much of the information in the book is theoretical, and borrowed from elsewhere. Apart from that, the processes are heavyweight, and not suited to the efficient execution of real software projects.It's a very dull book, and the author's self congratulatory tone soon becomes irritating. Needless to say, I was very disappointed.Do yourself a favour and buy a real book on QA!"
1,Zero stars! My first and last Kayak CD!,Terrible! Who said this is prog rock? Dumb pop-rock with stupid boring melodies and arrangements!
3,Buy this book if you are an interior designer!,"I bought this book because someone else's review was so high on it. The review was misleading. This book has very few exterior photos of houses and the exterior photos are tiny. It has no floor plans. I'm an architect and this book is virtually useless for me. The book is mostly on interior decorating and the interior photos are beautiful. For architecture this book gets one star, for interior decorating it gets five stars."
2,Too Hard!,This puzzle is too hard! We bring puzzles into work and do them as a group during lunches and breaks. It usually takes us about a month to complete a puzzle but this one is taking forever. The pieces are very small and misshaped. Pieces that look like edges are not and they are cut so odd. I was hoping to have this completed by Christmas so we could hang it as a decoration but we will be lucky to have it finished by Easter.I guess if you really need a challenge and are a puzzle aficionado then you might enjoy this puzzle. If you are looking for a simple activity this puzzle is not for you.
5,Excellent Leaning' Tree cars,"I bought these cards as a gift for my elderly mother-in-law who has a hard time getting out to buy celebration cards. These are perfect and include birthday, anniversary, etc. She loved them."
3,Fun on dry land! Sinks in the water!,My son got this when he turned 2. Now 2.5! We had a pool party and quickly discovered this boat dosen't float! His cousin had alot of fun going to the bottom of the pool to get it. The toys that come with it are nice but we had to take the fishing pole away because he kept getting hurt (swinging it around). He uses the scrubbers in the bath to clean his toes and finger nails. He pushes the boat around on the carpet and seems to like it. WISH IT WOULD FLOAT!
3,sinking boat,"We bought this bath toy for our son when he was 1, he is now 2. He really enjoyed playing with the toys that came with the boat. However, he gets very frustrated with the boat itself. It fills with water and is constantly sinking. Over and over again he would become frustrated, so we put it away. At times he still plays with the other items, but we got this specifically for the boat. So for us, this item was a disappointment."
3,Rusting tub toy,"I purchased this set for my toddler about 8 months ago. He really likes boats in the bathtub but has a lot of trouble with this one. It is very heavy & fills with water/sinks frequently which frustrates him. The entire top removes from the boat or there is a hinged opening that can be flipped back to add or remove toys from inside.My son likes to ""catch"" the fish using the fishing poles & the cups are fun to fill & drain since they have different types of holes in the bottom and drain at different rates or can be stacked into a tour on the side of the tub.Unfortunately the toy has some metal screws holding the top piece & hinged door together that rusted. I expect bathtub toys to be designed to be wet so I was disappointed in this toy."
2,Pinched Fingers and Rusty Screws,"Our daughter is 17 months old and I got this for her months ago. She loves the little toys that come inside of it, especially the cups and fish. I had to take the boat away from her because her little fingers got pinched in the water wheel and the screws are now rusted anyway, so it does not hold up to water. Oh well....."
4,Love it!!,"I bought this for my 14 month old, and he absolutely loves it! All of his other bath toys are now collecting dust! He loves trying to catch the fish with the fishing pole and watching water come out of the bottom of the stacking cups (they have different sized holes for the water to filter through)."
5,This is an outstanding chuck,"This is an outstanding chuck. It is absolutely massive, and grips tenaciously. Because of the gearing down you get, you will find that you've got enough force to crush delicate bottoms of bowls or - in expansion mode - blow pieces of wood apart.The point being that, like with a good glue - the limiting factor is not going to be in this tool, it's going to be the wood that you're turning.My only complaint is that I have three different jaw sets, and it's a pain to switch them out - I would really like to buy two more chuck bodies, so that I never have to switch!"
5,very pleased,Heard good things about this chuck from locals at a woodturners club and so decided to try it.... completely satisfied and would purchase same again!
5,Eagle Creek Pack-it Folder 18,"Purchased this as a gift for someone - He didn't know he needed a packing folder until he used it for a business trip. Now he wonders how he ever traveled without it. Allowed him to take a week's worth of clothes, neatly folded and organized, and compressed into a smaller space."
1,Very Poor product,"The microfibre sleeve offers no protection except mabey from rubbing!?The wrist rest has no cutouts for the small rubber protectors on the edges of the screen, I had to try to cut my own otherwise the laptop wouldn't close properly. Now it looks awful.The microfibre keyboard protector has thick stitching around the perimeter which also inhibit closing.They obviously never actually tested this product on a MacBook Pro."
2,McCall is no Maupin,"First, I am a faithful reader of McCall's No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency series. So, I bought this book after reading that McCall serialized this novel in the style of Maupin's ""Tales of the City."" [""Tales of the City"" is filled with lively, colourful characters -- one of which is the city of San Francisco -- a truly delightful book.]Edinburgh is another such place, a fantastic city filled with interesting people. I'm sorry to say that not one of these characters made it into ""44 Scotland Street."" If one were to judge Edinburgh and the people therein by this book, you'd believe the city were filled with mundane folks.I didn't hate the book but I couldn't recommend that anyone waste their time reading it, either."
3,Unfair To Compare?,"The format struck me as being very much akin to the books of Maeve Binchy; short insights into the inner workings and intertwinings of the lives of a series of characters. In my opinion, Maeve Binchy does a much better job of this. Smith's characters were rather flat and dull and I just didn't care about them. The potential for a much more interesting book was there yet it seemed to remain just out of reach. Not a waste of time, but not a book that will linger long in the memory."
3,Disappointing Series,"Once you have listened to Lisette LeCat, it is difficult to appreciate any other narrator. So far, the characters in 44 Scotland Street are not engaging me like Ma Romotswe and Mr. JLB Matakoni did."
3,It did come highly recommended...,"This is the first AMS book I have read. Despite not having that ""oh, what a great book!"" feeling after reading it, I feel it would be a disservice to an obviously smart writer for this to be the last book of his I read. I loved the style and dry sense of humor, and I loved the idea of it being written in bits and pieces for a daily paper, and I liked most of the parts of the book that weren't proprietary Scotland...but for the parts that were (and there were many) I was completely lost. Maybe I won't be as lost after I visit Scotland in June, but for right now, I felt a total outsider (and maybe that was the point) as I read. I will now go read ""#1 Ladies Detective Agency,"" and perhaps Mr. Smith will redeem himself."
4,Pat's foray into Edinborough,"This another triumphant, entertaining novel by Alexander MCcall Smith, centers around Pat, a 20 year old in her shocking SECOND gap year before college, sharing a flat in Edinborough at 44 Scotland St., with a number of quirky characters. I found it quite funny, and would recommend it to anyone who likes British humor. You should not read it, however, if you are looking for more of the #1 Ladies Detective Agency. It's terrific, but it's not Precious."
1,"Nice try, but...","...this experiment did not work. I've read two of his other books, and they were a light, cute diversion -- not great literature, but entertainment. This novel isn't even that. The plot frequently goes nowhere, and has many loose ends that he never ties. The writing is trite, the observations pedestrian and cliched."
2,Mildly Interesting,"This book was just okay for me. There is a quirky cast of characters who offer a glimpse of life in Edinburgh. The book is lighthearted, whimsical, and unfortunately, quite often... boring. I found the book amusing at times and McCall Smith did have a few keen observations on the human condition."
3,pastiche,"It's a lightly amusing pastiche of the lives of the occupants of a block of flats in Edinburgh. A young couple have a 5 year old son, Bertie, who is the centre of his mother's life and albeit that the child is intelligent, perhaps more than just intelligent, the mother has decided that his life must be crammed full of ""significant"" pastimes, like speaking Italian and playing the saxaphone. The poor little boy only wants to be left alone to play with his train set and to play football with ,as yet, non existent friends. Another occupant is a 20 year girl who is beginning her second gap year between school and university ( we never find out why she's doing a second year!), and shares a flat with a beautiful looking young man who is a complete narcissist. The stories are an amusing, light read but go nowhere, without a beginning or an end, and finish, leaving the reader up in the air."
2,Did Mr McCall Smith have an urgent bill to pay?,"I've only just found out this was written as a newspaper serial. It now makes some sense. My initial impression was that it was dashed off to pay for a new sofa/yacht/Renoir for Mr McCall Smith, who had a weekend spare to knock it out. Knowing it's a newspaper serial it's more likely he cranked out each day's instalment while he had his morning coffee/tea/whatever.A handful of interesting, but only two-and-a-bit dimensional, characters do stuff. Some of this stuff has consequences - which you will predict with uncanny accuracy.There are some nicely-drawn scenes, and you get a slight sense of living in Edinburgh (well, part of Edinburgh). But basically sod-all of any interest occurs. And then it just stops.This is the first book I've read of his - having heard people rave about the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency series. I don't really feel like reading any more."
2,Disappointing Series - Scotland Street,"I was disappointed in this series. I had read the entire series of the Number One Ladies Detective Agency and loved the simple but charming prose. I had also read the entire Irregular Portuguese Verbs series and loved it for the witty arrogance of the main character. I was amazed that these two series had been written by the same author, since they were so diametrically different in their writing style. Therefore it was with great hopes that I bought the Scotland Street series. But I found it so utterly pretentious with characters who throw latin phrases around like colloqualisms and who seem altogether too clever to ever ingratiate themselves to the reader."
2,a dull story about dreary malcontents,"Based upon my enjoyment of McCall Smith's ""No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency"" series, I bought all four of the '44 Scotland Steet' books. I don't care to finish the first book, '44 Scotland Street', and plan to return the other three books. I have never seen such a dreary collection of mal-contented characters gathered in one story, and don't even care what happens to them all. If I can't care about at least one of them, then I can't care about the story's outcome. The author shows no resemblance whatsoever to the one who wrote about the noble characters and humorous daily life that I came to appreciate while reading the ""No. 1.."". series. There is no sizzle, no tension, no appreciation for the author or his characters, no timing. PASS!"
2,Just 'ok',"I started reading 'The no.1 Ladies Detective Agency' but could never really get into it. I liked the idea of this book however so decided to give the author another go. Sadly, although the book has some funny moments (Bertie's tantrums!)it never really gripped me. I love Scotland but am not familar enough with the places and slang terms so felt i missed out on the 'insider' comments. The book also has a very poor ending which leaves lots of loose ends and you end up thinking 'hold on what happened to..?' and 'what was the point of?'.On the whole it is ok and i imagine if you are familar with Edinburgh you would enjoy it more than i did."
1,Damaged Goods,"I can't believe a bookseller would in good faith sell this book on tape. The disks were damaged and un""readable"". I expect a few skips here and there on any used CD but this was ridiculous and it started on the 2nd track and continued almost without a break. Frankly I have little or no idea what this book was about."
4,Cozy and Quaint,"There is something about McCall's Smith's writing that brings a smile to my face. Having read all of the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency books and adored them, I was hoping to find this series appealing as well and I certainly do. Meeting these Scottish characters is like sitting down to share a cup of coffee with a group of friends. Normally, the tangents some of these characters take would feel irrelevant and make me feel rather impatient, but I was willing to ramble anywhere in the city and cover any subject with these folks. I just wanted to spend time with them. I like Pat too. She's a realistic, sympathetic character and I look forward to sharing new experiences with her."
1,Not worth reading,"I love to read and was interested in a story set in Edinburgh. I found the characters not worth following and the story even less so. With nothing else new to read on my Kindle, I kept going back, hoping for something interesting to happen. Nothing ever did."
1,"Boring, slow, and simplistic","This author's books have been recommended to me, but if this is a true example of his talent I won't waste time reading more. This book was boring. The characters were simplistic and predictable. The story dragged along, not really holding my interest. I kept waiting for something to tie it all together but that never happened. It's a slice of a few very mundane lives. The writing is so simplistic that I suspect its target audience must be 12 years old. Yawn....."
4,Interesting read,This book is a light yet interesting story and is well told. The characters are drawn well and seem true to life.
5,Book 1 in a great series!,"I love this series so much, I've read it twice and bought this copy of book 1 for my daughter and son-in-law (who's a Scot). You don't have to know Edinburgh to love the places and especially the characters. The only downside is that McCall Smith only wrote 5 books in the series, and seems to be moving on to a different series."
4,makes you want to visit Scotland,"Good characters, an alluring setting and a good tale make this series an enjoyable read. You will be eager to read the next one."
4,A Rollicking Excursion through Edinburgh,"The first thing to know about this book is that it was written in seral format for a newspaper in Scotland. The second thing to know is that it doesn't make a lot of sense. The third thing is -- if you can get past the first two, this book is downright hilarious. Don't expect a great work of fiction, but do expect some wry observations on the human condition, as well as some unique characters.I would have liked to see things wrapped up a bit more at the end (What happened to Bertie? And Lizzie? And Big Lou??), but still -- LOVED THIS. Alexander McCall Smith is an intelligent, entertaining, and quirky writer."
5,A very enjoyable read,"I really liked this book. It was a joy to read. The characters are interesting and unpredictable. Also, it's been a while since I've laughed out loud while reading a book, but I did so with this one."
4,Handy book to have in the shop.,"This book is handy to have around the shop. The book is full of useful tips and information. The tips pertain mostly to woodworking. I found quite a few tips which I've already put to use. I found a good tip on how to make my own wiping varnish. Tried it and was very pleasantly surprised. It works great and is cheaper than store bought. The tips are divided into several categories such as tips about table saws, hardware, jointers and planers, routers, finishing, etc. Good book. Worth buying."
5,Leander class frigates by Jim Allaway,"This is not a text book, no spec's no dimensions, no weapons systems or sensors. What it is is a great collections of very clear close up photo's of every ship in the class (I think) It shows the ships as the changed from a general purpose gun frigate to purpose type AA or ASW ships. If you are building a model or just interested in this class of ship this is a very nice tool. You can get it from the UK."
5,Best Movie I've seen in a long time,"When I say ""best movie I've seen in a long time,"" I'm not talking about shoot-em up action flicks, or syrupy chick flicks. This movie has stunning dialogue written for (shock) intelligent people!The performances are stellar all the way around. Tom Cruise plays a right wing pathological deviant in power superbly. I was reminded of his fiendish glee playing the vampire Lestat. Streep plays the duped, but now waking up journalist with just the right cynical weariness, and Redford, as always, puts his heart into his politics.If you're tired of crap, tired of empty BS and cheap Hollywood, watch this one and understand that art, indeed, can be the path to truth."
5,Fantastic movie!,"This is an awesome movie that really makes you think about what is really happening with the war, politics and the media behind it all."
2,Redford's Weakest Directorial Effort,"A little less conversation and more filmmaking would have helped this muddled attempt at socio-political discourse. Matthew Michael Carnahan's lecture-heavy script remains as flat as Robert Redford's stage-bound direction - an astonishing comedown from ""A River Runs Through It"" and ""Quiz Show."" The portrayals of Redford, Meryl Streep and Tom Cruise are straitjacketed by this visually static approach. ""Lions for Lambs"" offers a few good scenes between Redford's impassioned professor and Andrew Garfield's ambivalent student, but the overwhelming preachiness negates any dramatic momentum."
2,skip it,"Why hollywood can't make a decent movie about current geopolitical subjects is hard to grasp, but here we have yet another failed attempt. If you're looking for an 80 min lecture telling you what you already know, then this may be for you. Otherwise take a pass. What is particularly frustrating is the over simplicity of the 'debates' where obvious important points of contention are altogether avoided. None of the 3 settings/plots holds up to plausible scrutiny. I'm a really big Robert Redford fan, but this is a swing and a miss."
2,Good but certainly not excellent,"The cast tries to do a good job, but the script is not meeting them half way, which makes it difficult for them to achieve their goal. Except for the little bit of action when the soldiers in Iraq are faced with a huge crisis, the rest is pretty much talk, talk and talk all the way to the end.The movie is seperated in 3 different scenarios, which in reality, are all part of the same situation... a few specific soldiers dealing with war in Iraq.There are better movies out there concerning this issue with a more intelligent and entertaining script. You can easily skip this one."
2,"Don't waste your time watching, renting or buying this movie.",My title is pretty much my review. This movie has so much potential for a good story.. but.. the 3 of us that watched it had no idea what the movie was trying to tell after it was over.. it sucked!
4,"The More Things Change, The More Things Stay The Same!",A new approach. A new mandate. A new vision. End result: dead American soldiers and a bankrupt economy. This is a finely done anti-war film that makes the viewer pay attention. Now if the viewers would only pay attention during this upcoming presidential election! Final lesson: The only thing men learn from history is that men never learn from history.
1,WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN,This is THE worst movie I have ever seen...could not watch it even for 20 mins and came out of the theatre... you can do anything in this world other than watching it ..period.
4,See it NOW,"Actually, 3 stars for composition, 4.5 stars for message, 5+ stars for final graphics.This isn't cut together as an action film, though it could have been. It's not pure entertainment, either. It's a provocative movie that makes no secret of its intent to challenge your personal convictions. It's completely gutsy.If you have family in the armed forces on deployment overseas, this one could be pretty hard to watch. Otherwise, it's a must see! Watch it before the month is out. Watch it twice if someone you cared for was taken by war -- once for yourself and once to honor the memory of the fallen."
2,same thing,All about slamming the war and our president and keeping a liberal view in going into the military! Save your money and time!
4,An American film with intelligence and depth,"This film tells of the story of a university professor, a clever but disillusioned student, a journalist, a hot shot politician aiming for the presidency and some of the professor's ex-students from poor backgrounds who enlisted for the American army.The film portrays the ignorance and moral evil of politicians who use wars of agression and hence people's lives to further their own careers. The acting is excellent. I was particularly surprised with Tom Cruise.The only problem I had with the film is that it fails to mention the innocent civilians who have died at the hands of American imperialist agression. This is why the film gets 4 stars.This is a rarity - a Hollywood film with some depth and a moral message."
4,Entertaining film. I really enjoyed it.,"I thought this film did a good job at presenting a very clear storyline to follow even though it bounced between the experiences of a couple different characters. Not the most satisfying ending, but its always nice to see an occasional movie the depicts a more realistic outcome."
4,Worth your time,This was a very intriguing movie. The cast pulled me in to watch it and their performances didn't let me down. As usual Meryl Streep was incredible.
3,"Had a potential, but the script was weak","I have to admit the movie had good promise and Redford tried. But the strength of the script was seriously lacking.I was going to give it two stars but it got three for the effort.However the subject matter was great and worthy of exploration. I am a vet myself and some scenes were very touching.Still I suggest,you pass.Cheers."
3,misses and misses by a lot,"Every once in a while the American public proves it's not so stupid after all. Surprisingly, that's often done by letting poor films fail at the box office, even films that have stars and might have been good. And this film is a good example. The film doesn't work on so many levels that it's almost pointless to mention them. Actually, it is pointless. But: poor writing and casting are what sink it. Unconvincing characters speaking mediocre dialogue.One mini-positive: I can't think of a single film that has gotten journalists right since All the President's Men. Russell Crowe was awful as a journalist in another film where Americans proved they're not so stupid. (Ben Affleck was awful too, but ...) Jennifer Connelly was entirely unconfincing as a photojournalist in Blood Diamond. It's not a short list. But Streep is pretty good here. She doesn't get everything, but she gets a lot."
3,"ROBERT REDFORD, OPUS 7","*** 2007. Directed by Robert Redford. The subject is the Irak and the Afghanistan wars seen through the eyes of a journalist, a politician, a teacher, a student and two soldiers. With the exception of some school or army scenes, LIONS FOR LAMBS presents only dialogues between two characters expressing their points of views. The concept is interesting and honorable but very frustrating for a viewer not particularly fond of ex cathedra lectures. As usual, this kind of film will please those of you admiring the ideas of the director and the screenwriter and hurt the others unless they are convinced by the arguments. Redford's intentions are laudable because, after all, his model, Plato's dialogues, are high points of the world literature but one mustn't forget that these books were meant to be read by educated people only while motion pictures are destined to a larger audience who is waiting to be entertained and not moralized. A DVD zone rental only."
2,Warning!,"Warning: Get ready for a long, boring, confused (and confusing) rant by the geo-political and military expert, Robert Redford. He is, of course, not wrong about everything. But he is wrong about enough of the important issues that makes this movie of little enduring value. Meryl Streep's performance is the only thing that rings true in this movie. Better choices are ""The Kingdom"" or ""Charlie Wilson's War."""
1,I don't think you should watch this movie,"This movie is so very preachy and predictable, and pretentious and many other word that may or may not start with p. The same ideas are said over and over, and they are ideas said in our society over and over and better by others. As an action movie it falls really short, as political drama it falls short, as a story of inspiration way short and silly too...and it's like one big lecture by Redford and Streep and Cruise being the mouthpiece for conservative politics.Really, whatever."
5,Redford was ahead of his time with this one!,"I first watched this film when it was released back in 2007. Looking at it again I feel we're at the same place academically, politically, and with journalism. With that said, I'm inspired to seek change ""for goodness sake"". For the record my opinion is it's a ""Great Film"".SB Enyart."
4,Impressive Character Drama,"I was impressed by this little movie. Robert Redford is known for films that have that ""what if?"" or ""you decide"" quality to them. A bit philosophical. A bit exposition. Very nice work in this short character piece.The script is very well written, the acting is great, and the characters hold no punches in expressing their viewpoints. It's representative of what's going on today and at the same time the writer is sending an obvious message, as I would expect writers to do.Judging by the reviews of the movie thus far, you will notice how this movie does and does not strike a chord with viewers. This film was never expected to be a blockbuster hit, but it is certainly a thinking film. Some will have an opinion towards it. Some will have no reaction to the film at all. I can't help but feel the film has made its point.Down side: a bit short. But worth seeing."
2,Playing a politician Tom Cruise,"At different levels of participation, movie provides story of decision-makers and executers of US solutions in Afghanistan, assembling technical and moral issues.Personally, a reviewer is not convinced much in this story presented quite boringly with Tom Cruise playing politician."
2,Ham-Handed Silliness,"I rented the DVD because it starred (among others) Derek Luke. The guy is good. The movie is not. Redford directs this overtly ideological film like a carpenter with a pocket full of thumbtacks and a sledgehammer. The silliness cuts across party lines, with both Streep and Cruise vying for the ""most befuddled character"" award. No one wins."
4,"An excellent book that, perhaps, bites off too much","This is one of the best price guide books for American records. Due to its detailed information and clearly organized listings, it surpasses all previous publications in its scope and usefulness. It adds artists not previously mentioned in past price guides but does omit artists on a somewhat arbitrary basis. Why Getz and not Gillespie etc.? For the artists it does include, much hard work is reflected in the thorough discographies which list reissue information and pressing chronology with great accuracy. Obscure artists with limited product are, as is common with books of this type, omitted. For the money, this is the best book. Only Osborne's Rockin Records covers more ground, but in less essential detail."
3,Good-but not good enough!,"A good catalog by Tim Neely, as they usually are, but this newest edition had too many missing artists from the early rock era. Important artists such as Dion, Dion and the Belmonts, and Del Shannon are entirely missing from this catalog. The color section is very good, but I am disappointed with this book."
3,American Records,The Goldmine Standard Catalog of American REcords has valuable information if you know who the recording artist was. It does not have a cross reference index where you can look up a record by the title if you do not know the artist. I was disappointed that it lacked a cross reference index.
4,Wonderful... Just Wonderful,"This is such an amazing album. Its warm and cold, open and exposed. The instrumentation is on point. This album is perfect for the women and girls to evolve to."
2,Not so much,"My brother raved about this CD (Perhaps because he is the biggest ""Natural Born Killers"" freak in the known universe), but I was very disappointed in it. There is not a single song by this band that I would care to listen to again, besides maybe ""Get Your Tongue Wet"" (and it's not on this CD - Check it out on ""Bolt of Lightning""). I wanted to like it, but I just couldn't."
3,Juliette and the licks - You're speaking my language,"Plenty of good songs on the album but falls short of quality, because their relatively new its not to bad. Listen to it before you buy."
5,EASY AS 1-2-3 with Turnball!,"My father is from Haiti, so I understand most Creole, but I don't speak it. So post-the EARTHQUAKE of 2010, I've committed to learning Creole to assist my Haitian people and fill a void that has been missing for me to connect with other Haitians!I purchased this book along with the workbook as it was recommended for me to use during my online skype Creole class (if you'd like to take the class, it's free online and you can sign up on ""Haitian Hub.com""...the creator/instructor Carlo Diy is AWESOME!). The Turnball books have been very effective and easy to follow, they are PRICELESS purchases to me..it is worth every penny!"
5,Very helpful,"This little book is very helpful for learning the basics of Haitian Creole. I use it every time I prepare to go to Haiti, as a review. It makes conversing easy. The audio files are also extremely helpful. Highly recommended!"
4,Well worth the price,I found this a very useful book to get an idea what Creole is all about. It is short and simple and each chapter makes you more eager to go on to the next. I had the advantage to have learned French in school. Without that I imagine it can be difficult to get an idea how the Creole words should be pronounced. A simple audio tape in addition to the textbook would be most welcome indeed.
4,need the whole package,"Haitian Creole is a fun language, especially if you know French and can see the correspondences. However, you'd be best served getting the entire package - this book plus the CD and the workbook. The workbook provides an excellent expansion on the meager detail in the book. No where does any of the books provide a section on greetings - these have to be gleaned from the dialogues (Bonjou, etc.). I guess that's what the Hippocrene phrasebook is for. Otherwise, it's a fun set of books that will give you the base you'll need if going to Haiti (or Miami) and want to start communicating in Kreyol."
5,Perhaps the Most Romantic Love Scene in All Literature...,"You can admire Dunnett's wonderful Lymond Chronicles for many reasons, yet for me, the most powerful aspect of this particular book was Lymond's tenderly passionate, infinitely soulfull, romantic interlude with a cunning dark haired beauty. This is Lymond at his most elegant and most intimate. I love the intellectual challenge of these books. I adore the heart pounding action. I only wish there were more scenes like this one; yet I suspect that this is precisely the reason why this passage was so very special ... and, aruably the most romantic love scene in all literature.Cheryl Lee"
5,Intrigue and suspense abound,"Excellent book-I liked it even better than ""The Game of Kings"". The characters are vivid, the intrigue is complex and the suspense is high as Lymond tries to foil several assasination attempts on young Mary, Queen of Scots. Very enjoyable-I would recommend it to anyone who likes historical fiction and/or mystery novels. Definitely an engrossing page-turner."
3,Beautiful. But...,"The pendant itself is just lovely, and I had great service from Silver Insanity. But...To reverse from onyx to Mother of Pearl, the stone actually rotates _within_ the framework of the pendant, rather than reversing simply by flipping the whole thing over. Really, it's a neat idea, but it doesn't work very well in practice. The stone rotates so freely that nearly any movement at all can set it to turning, and it often stops mid-flip, with neither onyx nor Mother of Pearl showing entirely. Instead, it's often the silver frame that shows, with a sliver of white and black on top and bottom. How unfortunate for an otherwise lovely necklace!Once I determine how best to stop the free spinning, I'll be very happy with it."
1,Mon dieu!,"This is easily the worst playing of baroque music on the piano I have ever heard. Granted I am a harpsichordist and early music freak, but I am very open to performers like Perahia and Gould who understand what baroque is about. I started to say that Rameau is not Chopin, but this kind of thoroughly self-indulgent playing would be terrible for Chopin too."
5,EXCELLENT PRODUCT,The Eleutherococcus senticosus (Siberian Ginseng) is not really Ginseng. It is an adaptogen shrub.the contents are:Kava kava Extract(piper methysticum)(root) (Standardized to contain min. 30% Kavalactones) 250 mg *Eleuthero(Eleutherococcus senticosus) (root) 100 mg
2,Not as relaxing as would I would like.,I think some of the non-Kava ingredients act as a stimulant so it does not aid in sleep as I was hoping. NOW has always been a solid brand so I dont blame the quality of the capsules as much as the ingredients which are listed.
1,"Terrible product, fake positive reviews.","Not only does this product lack the Kava kick that I know and love, but it also contains other herbs that are STIMULANTS. What a waste of money. Who packs stimulants in a stress relieving sedative? And who goes and makes multiple 5 star reviews to inflate the reputation of the product? No thanks. I'll buy another brand from now on."
1,Is there anything lower than...,"Most of this stuff was recorded around Just Testing and is pretty much evidential why it stayed away from the buying public for all these years. Most of the tracks sound like scrappy harsh demos with the occasional buried vocal. More or less, this was another overblown project that should have been left alone. For diehards only!!!"
2,Batth Ball,"Bought two, the housing is made of soft plastic that snaps together but comes apart easily, I ended up using twist ties to hold it together.The ball hangs under the tap and water splashes over it, unlike other filters, there is no way to ensure that all of the water is filteredI bought it as a cheap alternative to an in line filter and got exactly that, a cheap and less affective alternative."
1,Skin Reaction and Irritation - completly true!,"I bought this product and actually started applying it to my legs (thinking it could help my veins there) - after 2 weeks with no affect, my legs are completely broken out with swollen, red bumps and extremely itchy. I have no idea what is causing this reaction, but 6 days into having this rash and it still will not go away. Open to any ideas to treat this!"
1,BEWARE!,"Horrible allergic reaction after using product under the eyes! I wish I would have read these reviews before purchasing.I've been in terrible discomfort for 3 days even after discontinuing use of this product. I have severe itchy, swollen red eyes--both lower and upper lids--along with a stinging pain I cannot even describe all over the eye area. Terrible product, and very irresponsible of this company to recommend to consumers that it is safe to use under eye area.I am so shocked since normally JASON Naturals make great products. However, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!Vitamin K Crème Plus 2 oz. 3 Ounces"
1,Toxic to skin,This product created a rash on my wife's eyes that lasted weeks and caused scarring. Only oral steroids helped it. This product contains an ingredient that seems to be toxic to her skin--and clearly that of many others.
1,Not for use around eyes!,"I started using this product about a month ago or 6 weeks ago, once per day. Approximately a week ago I noticed my eyelids stung a bit when I applied the creme, so I decided to discontinue using it for a while to give me skin a break. After not using the product for over a week, I woke up this morning with eyes so swollen I could barely open them. The skin all around my eyes is red, itchy, dry and swollen. This morning I tried cold compress and Benadryl, with no results, so I had to go to Urgent Care this afternoon. The Dr. said Vitamin K should never be used on the sensitive skin around the eyes, that any potency of it will eventually cause over sensitization and a flare up like mine. He gave me an Rx for a steroid cream, but says it may take many days for the redness and swelling to go down. It's a shame Jason doesn't put a warning on the bottle about not using on the skin surrounding your eyes, in fact they advertise it to be used to lighten under eye circles!"
2,Does Not Diminish Broken Capillaries...,"I bought this cream thinking it would get rid of the two red spots on my nose (broken cappilaries) or greatly reduce the appearance of them, but it did not do anything at at with consistant use and it discolored my nose an orangish color. Would not reccomend this product for broken cappilaries."
1,Poor quality reproduction,"This is a great book; unfortunately the format of this kindle edition is useless and unreadable. Some pages are simply scanned in as pictures. We need a proper, quality electronic version of this series."
4,Cute,"This is not one that I would recommend for guys. I've tried to get one of my guy friends to read it, and he couldn't really get into it. It was kind of cute, but the ending was anticlimatic as far as the series goes. I liked it as far as the romance went, it got interesting. Not the best, but not bad either."
4,Hot and steamy...I think,"So, I have to say, this series IS for the older readers, but I think it will appeal to everyone who loves romance!I think this is better then 'Wild Act', Rie Takada's previous work, because the characters seem to be drawn more mature.The story is cute and HILARIOUS!!! A very lightingning read if you're feeling down!"
1,Mike Randall,Poor turn-around and customer service. Do NOT order from this vendor. Was not able to ship one week after placing order from this company. I suggest finding an actual harley location.
5,Just what my husband wanted,Great quality-and exactly what my husband wanted-he has had this a year now and it is still in qreat shape. The chain is not big and chunky and also not cheap. I would recommend this one.
2,not the best PKD has to offer,"I have been re-reading all of PKD's novels. This one is pretty much a dud. It has some great PKD themes--Military Industrial Complex gone wild, time/reality distortion, etc--but the plot is pretty sloppy and the characters are not fleshed out. Worth reading simply because it is a PKD book. But seeing that it is out of print--don't kill yourself trying to find a copy."
2,ordinary reading,"If you are used to explore Dick's movie,I'm sure you won't find many attractive themes in these novel.Apart from some curious character (the toys'producer) I haven't found any reason of interest.Avoid,if you have something better to read."
3,Second-Rate PKD,"It comes off half-baked, doesn't have as many great/new ideas in it as usual and doesn't cohere even to the usual degree. Dick himself called the book ""a turkey"". Having said that, for PKD fans who work their way down to this book, there are some good/funny parts in it."
4,much better than its title,"...although what pk dick novel isn't. This is written during PKD's peak period, and although the plot is not as convoluted as his best, the story is compelling, the main character is more sustained and complex than usual and the world is thoroughly PKD. The elite of earth's two superpowers have called a truce - which the general population doesn't know - and weapons 'fashion designers' make weapons that look and seem terrifying but don't really work. Into this peaceful counterfeit world enters a genuine alien enemy and the bogus fashion designers have to come up with a weapon that will actually do some harm. Hint: it's not really a weapon. Along with the usual darkness, PKD can't resist coming up with a takeoff of contemporary SF (early 60's) as a subplot, of which the title - I guess - is a sample."
4,Lighter on the brain than most PKD books,"I am generally a PKD fan. Most of his books have so many sub texts and paranoia that it takes a little neurosis to understand. This is one his few books where this is a little less intense. The plot and character interactions are straight forward. Themes are reitierated in a concise language. And the book has an unusual optimistic feel in the ending. Which, it being a PKD book, freaked me out."
4,Very Useful,"This book offers some very useful insights on not only modern-day-terrorism and terrorism tactics, but also goes in depth with how citizens and local police work just as hard in preventing a terrorist attack. Useful charts and pictures. Also projects the future of terrorism (the next 5-15 years of terrorism)."
5,What a man! What a Book!,"Engaging, I feel like I am part of the book. Well written biography by his wife. I loved it because I enjoy the type of life that he lived. It would be a better world if everyone lived and viewed life as Will Rogers."
5,Cute novelty item,"I bought these for my son, who loves Guiness. He likes wearing them as a 'conversation starter'. They were cute, seem to stand up well and people love them!"
4,Big Boy Pete - 'The Perennial Enigma' (Angel Air),"Way I discovered Big Boy Pete was when I heard his 1968 single ""Cold Turkey"" that on a various artists CD that I happened to purchase 'Electric Sugar Cube' on the Bomp label (see my review). 'The Perennial Enigma' is a CD reissue from a 1973 lp that I never even knew about prior to hearing this title. Best described as British psychedelic. Most memorable tracks here include ""Get Up And Dance"", ""The Farm"", the awesome sounding ""All Down The Road"", the inspiring ""My Place"", ""The Prayer"" and the tripping ""Guitar Center On A Saturday Afternoon"". Personnel: Big Boy Pete (aka Pete Miller) - guitar & vocals, Dave Merrill - keyboards, Sean Silverman - bass, Ray Moseley - tenor sax and Rob Anderson - drums. Recommended for fans of The Troggs, The Herd, Fuzztones and The Easybeats. If you're wanting a add a little-known audio gem to your sacred CD collection, look no further."
3,who wrote all these [...],It sounds like each of the [...]. Come on now guys let yor music sell it self. The album sounds good enough with out having to write [...] reviews.
5,Albion chelated magnesium,"This is the most effective form of magnesium that I've taken. I notice that soon after taking it, my leg cramps and muscle spasms are alleviated. It also helps me relax at bedtime."
2,Not completely chelated,"I bought this in the store while I was waiting for another bottle of chelated magnesium to ship from Amazon. This one says it is ""buffered"" which I've read means that they use some amount of magnesium oxide. That translated to the same stomach/intestinal problems I have w/ regular mag oxide. It may absorb better but I can't take very much of it. Won't be buying it again."
1,Burning Sensation & Hair loss,"Purchased this dye at a health food store for $15.99 believing it was all natural. In the matter of 15 minutes it started burning my scalp. I am suppose to keep this on my head for 30 to 45 minutes because of heavy grays. Rinsed hair, hair felt stripped of its natural oils, was tangled and noticed clumps of hair in my hand and sink. Well thank goodness for the conditioner which took some of the tangles but had to do a second treatment with my coconut oil. Once I was done with my hair project I decided to do a little GOOGLING and unfortunately this product isn't as safe as you might be led to believe. Will not buy again."
4,Natural product.,These product has more durability in your hair then the others most populars and it's made from natural ingredients. I'm buyng that for few months because I saw the quality.
4,I like it,"I really like naturint product cause the smell is not strong and it's not that hard to remove dye on finger cause it's not too chemical. the color can last at least 2 months, haven't tried other natureal hair dye so can't be sure if it's perfect, but overall I recommend it."
5,Naturtint Permanent Hair Color,"Worked well, easy to use, no noxious smell, seems to stain skin much less, great price on amazon, still looks good after 2 1/2 weeks!"
1,very disappointed,"I tried Wheat Germ hoping to get rid of some brass and overly light blonde hair. This color did not come out very well on me (I'm naturally ashy but 'lift' in the golden hue). It did not look natural at all, but had a strange, almost ghostly lavender tint. What's worse: it's only been 9 days and any new color is completely gone. What's left behind is overly-bleached out looking and damaged. Will never EVER use again. Wish I had not believed all those good reviews. My hair immediately felt dry after applying it (it was okay before that) and now it's pretty much like straw. BAD stuff! Wish I could try Natural Instincts again, but they seem to have changed the formula..."
2,Naturint,The color did come close to the color on three box and left my hair brown. My natural color is dark brown. It's too expensive for lackluster results.
1,Not so amazing!,"I selected this product because it doesn't have harsh ingredients and chemicals. Lucky me, I used it different 5 times and I still have to go to the salon to get it corrected (I should just have bit the bullet and gone to the salon from the get go)! I started as a dark blonde (7N) and I wanted to go a little lighter for spring so I selected the 9N. It turned my hair red, not strawberry blonde, but brassy reddish. I then got an 8N thinking it would tone it down but no, it stayed brassy red. I then tried the ash to soften the red and low and behold, banana yellow! WHAT!!!!! I emailed the company and they said I need to mix the products so that the tones balance one another and you don't get the red or yellow tint, and yes, you can use it right away. Okay, I combined 8N with 10A - as per email instructions from the company and guess what - YELLOW! BANANA YELLOW! I have an appointment at the salon this week to get this fixed."
3,Nice highlights but doesnt cover grey,"I really like the highlights that i get from this light brown on very dark 4b hair. But, it does not cover grey."
2,Very Brassy!!!!,I bought this to touch up my roots. I have extremely curly hair so I tend not to worry too much about how hair color comes out (the curls disguise a lot) but if I was doing more than my roots I would be very displeased with this color...it is pure brass.
1,Can cause nasty allergic reaction,"Naturtint - Permanent Hair Colorant-Ebony Black, 4.5 fl oz liquidI used this product on my beard on the advise of my hairdresser. The whole face broke out. It was painful for 2 days and large welts appeared where I had applied this product.It is ironic, since I asked my hairdresser especially after most of the products for men's beards seem to cause the same type of allergic reaction. This was sold at my natural food store as a Natural Product. There is nothing natural about the chemicals in it. It just the name seems to suggest Nature. Good sales pitch. Not a very good product. That is why there are only 3 reviews."
4,Good,"Pretty good product. It didn't stink like chemicals like some other products I have used and the color looked natural. However, it seemed to wash out pretty quick. That tends to happen with my hair though as it is very fine. Other people might have better luck with it."
4,works for me,"It covers my grey well.This does not have a strong chemical odor and it does appear gentle on my scalp and hair.I basically use this just to cover my few but ever increasing in number lovely white roots.The only thing I dont like is the conditioner included is not strong enough and I have long hair and it's quantity not enough either,So I have to use a second party special after coloring conditioner."
4,Nutitint Hair Color,I was very happy with the results I achieved using Nutritint. The color seemed very natural and covered my grays.
1,7G Naturtint knotted my hair very badly,"I have been using Naturtint for 6 months and never had a problem, but this month there was a $5 discount on each box of color. Instead of just retouching my roots, I used both boxes and refreshed the color on all my medium long hair. Unfortunately, now it is knotted. I think Naturtint produced a bad batch of hair color and discounted the price.What is the best way to detangle my hair, now that it has become knotted?Which is better: ""Lush.com"" conditioner, Sebastian ""Stark Naked"" shampoo and ""Slinky"" conditioner, Treasured Locks ""Knot No More Tangle Remover"", Knotty Boy Removal Kit, Take Down Remover and Detangler, or natural Shea Butter?"
1,Looked purple,"Never actually used but returned this product and bought something in a local health food store. I know many woman like this shade, but seeing it online I didn't notice that is was that shade. I should have known based on the name Mahogany, so this was my mistake and doesn't reflect the product itself."
3,Hair Colorant-dark Chestnut brown,When it came I noticed it was too dark for updating my hair. so I never used it but I never sent it back. perhaps someday I will use it.
5,haircoloring,Highly recommend this product. It does not damage your hair. The color last unchanged unless you wash your hair twice a day. The gray hair stays shiny after Naturtint has washed away. This is great if you want to stop coloring your hair later on.
2,Extremely drying,"I die my hair the same shade as my natural color just to keep it shiny and get rid of the red tones caused by the sun. This didn't have too bad of a smell and came out the shade I expected, but it was extraordinarily drying. The conditioner it comes with doesn't seem to moisturize at all and even after using other heavy duty masks and moisture treatments, my hair is still struggling to recover. Previously I had been using natural match and natural instincts which I will be going back to. I'd like to go the natural route, but really dislike having straw for hair."
4,Good !,"This product is very good. I have used it for five years. This was the first time I bought it at amazon. Shipping was good, but the package was broken just a little."
4,1st time user,"As a first time user, i wanted to switch from toxic permanent colors to a natural permanent hair color. My hair had been previously dyed a light red. My natural hair color is dark brown. So, i dyed my hair with Naturtint 5m and here are my results.CONS- Made my hair a lot darker than the picture on the box- Instructions did not address special instructions or tips for previously colored hairPROS- Left my hair soft and shiny- Pretty good smell (a little like licorice)- Less toxic than other products*And heres a tip. If you have medium length hair(or longer) and are coloring for the 1st time, buy 2 boxes insead of 1. Or else you will run out.I gave this product 4 stars because it isn't 100% organic. And im trying to GO GREEN. Other than that, i would recommend it if you want to have a more pleasant dyeing experience since it smelled pretty good. And it didnt have strong hard-to-breathe fumes like most permanent hair dyes."
4,A Great Alternative,Since I'm pregnant I cannot use regular dyes so I tried this one. I used it yesterday so I am not sure how long it will last but so far so good. The only thing I can say about this color is that it comes out much more darker than I expected. Light chestnut brown is not light! But I still am very pleased with the results!
1,Looks awful :(,"It turned my hair bright yellow! It looks awful so I now have to get it fixed professionally. I followed all of the directions carefully, so I'm not sure why this happened."
4,Alls well that ends well,The product works great. I had a little problem with the shipping. The company made everything right and all in all--I now look like my youthful self. (As long as I don't put on my glasses)
5,Fantastic Product,"I was a little hesitant about purchasing this T.V. wall mount because the price was so cheap. However, I am very glad that I did. It is very sturdy and was very easy to put up. I have a 42"" television so I was a bit conserned at first because that is the largest television the mount says it can hold. The only thing I would say that is a possible negative is when using the mount for a 42 inch it does not slide back and forth very much, maybe a 1/2 inch. So if you need more than a 1/2 correction to line up with the studs this probably isn't going to work. One big plus is that it comes with a locking device that prevents the television from being lifted off of the brackets once it is locked into place. All in all it is a great product for the price. Beats paying $80 or even more for most others."
5,Great Conversation Piece,"I originally bought this mini-book for sheer novelty, but after getting it I left it out on my tv stand where it quickly became a conversation piece. The book is nicely animated, and the simple presentation of the test makes it easy for anyone to understand. Its sparked alot of great conversations, so I definately reccomend it to anyone."
4,Caustic wit,"If you don't share his caustic wit, look elsewhere. Great collection of essays, particularly a flight on the Concorde: ""The Concorde really is as beautiful as a heron: sleek, immaculate, very white and needle nosed. I had been expecting some of that Clockwork Orange brightness inside...the very nice businessman beside me once flew next to Michael Jackson, who amplified the claustrophobia...by spending the entire flight with a blanket draped over his famous head."""
3,Very Funny,"This book's writer has some very humorous insights into how the luxury we all live in is often taken for granted and he finds a great way to portray that in his essays. I also like Lloyd Dangle's latest book ""Troubletown"" as it presents the misguided adventures of our current leadership in a humorous yet insightful fashion as well.Troubletown Told You So: Comics that Could've Saved Us from this Mess"
5,Seeing the World Just a Little Bit Different,"How often have we filled out some incomprehensible Government form that we know we have to get right because it's the law. It takes a special mind to look at some of these questions and make it into a catchy essay.Mr. Rakoff has that kind of mind. It seems he can find a story in almost anything. And that's what this book is, a series of little stories, essays on the human condition in today's downtown New York City for the most part. The stories have a feeling that they were written for something else, one of the magazines for which Mr. Rakoff works pehaps. That doesn't matter, I don't read any of those magazines, so they're new to me.Like all good stories, these have a small lesson to teach. The point out the silliness of a lot of today's life. In looking at other reviews of this book, some people are more annoyed than amused. To them, all I can say is lighten up, so he doesn't like Bush, most New Yorkers liked the War Protester and the Ambulance Chaser."
1,Not as advertised,"I have never felt so ripped off by blurbs for a book. This book is advertised as a satirical look at some of the indignites of modern life. Instead, it is the mean, cynical whining of a person who feels he is superior to the reader.He thinks that all conservatives are Nazis and gay bashers.Mr. Rakoff....I really dont care what you do in your own life.I could like you or dislike you if you were gay OR straight.Just because you are so unhappy, don't perpetrate yourself on the world in the guise of a judge of modern society.I was so offended and bored by this book that I threw it in the recycling bin rather than donate it to the local library as I always do with books that are not keepers.This book made me almost as unhappy reading it as Mr. Rakoff is with his life."
2,"Cute at times, but mostly boring","I really wanted to like this book. I got the audio version. I was expecting witty commentary on America's consumer culture and self-obessive nature. What I got was long, meandering stories about things like midnight treasure hunts in NYC that were anti-climatic, and the mildly amusing tale of the author applying for U.S. citizenship. It had potential, but just never got rolling. His penchant for being self-desparaging and sounding melancholy also got old very quickly."
3,Meh..,"I first learned of David Rakoff because I was looking for more humor along the lines of David Sedaris. This collection sounded like it could be fun but after reading about half of it, I just couldn't get into it. There are some funny moments for sure but not enough to make me want to finish it."
2,Not As Funny As It Could Be,"Rakoff was a highly depressed man, and this book overflows with that energy. Unfortunately, it comes out neither as funny as I think he hoped, nor as profound as he hoped. It is merely a collection of essays about his experiences in New York, which don't seem to cohere or accomplish anything such as amuse, inform, inspire, or move one to think. They're well written, but to what end?"
5,Elegantly snide,"It is an overused comparison, but the late Mr. Rakoff (and regrettably I only learned of him after his demise) is rather like a dry and somewhat more snide David Sedaris. If think Mr. Sedaris too gentle, and perhaps a bit out of touch given his rise in popularity through the years, this is for you. On the other hand, if you already find Sedaris a bit crude or on the edge, look elsewhere. I thought this was hilarious."
1,What exactly was the point of this?,"Not good. I actually stopped reading and returned it to the bookstore about halfway through. Most of it was just meaningless; I'd reach the end of a chapter and wonder ""What was the point of that?"" While there were definitely funny parts, they were too few and far between. I expected witty social commentary, but all I got was pointless anecdotes and pretentious language. If I could describe the book in one word, it would be ""self-indulgent""; I suspect that Rakoff is the type of person who talks just to hear the sound of his own voice."
1,Comparable to Sedaris? Not likely!,"I read this book because it was recommended to fans of David Sedaris and Augusten Burroughs. However, Rakoff should not even be put on the same playing field as either of those brilliant authors.I was intrigued to read this book because of the reviews on the back cover - I really thought that I would get an outsiders view of Americans and our over-indulgent ways. However, I was mistaken. Yeah, Rakoff writes about getting citizenship and working in Miami - but the reader never really understands why he's doing all of this. The stories aren't funny because it feels like Rakoff is forcing them to be.For example, Rakoff plainly states that he went to work for 3 days in Miami. It's not like he just chanced an encounter there and funny things happened...he made up his mind to go there, and barely stayed long enough to even get a good story.All in all, I was happy when this book was over and I think that you will be, too!"
5,I loved this book!,"My husband recieved this book for Xmas. I started reading it and had trouble putting it down. My family got tired of me quoting it on our trip in Paris, so much so that they are all trying to read it at the same time. I love his off the wall twists and point of view on the the different subjects. OK so some of it is bitchy, which makes it even funnier!"
1,Not Funny,"I did not enjoy this book. I gave up waiting for the ""belly laughs"" promised in the description about 1/2 way through. Maybe I don't get it, but this felt more like a collection of rambling diary entries than humor. Sorry."
1,This book tries too hard,"I was really looking forward to settling in with this book and having a good laugh. Instead, what I found was a pretentious book where the author tried way too hard to be funny . . . and very little of it actually was. The author definitely has a way of turning a phrase in an original way, but you cannot hang an entire chapter on one cute phrase. Reading this book was just way too much effort and not nearly fun enough. Yuck."
4,just a comment,"K. Gratch ""good girl""- since you asked for an answer- it's a saw, someone is cutting the floor out from under the chair... i thought that was painfully obvious."
1,Full of hate and negatisim.,Why does this guy live in the US since he does nothing but rip on our country. He seems jealous and queeny. David Sedaris has similar books but they are actually funny and a bit more humble.
3,so so,a fun read but not very substantive. the various essays are entertaining but the author fails to correlate the works with the theme implied by the blurbs on the cover.
2,Light strings corrode quickly,"I've given Cleartone two chances, but the plain strings corrode too quickly for my liking. They last pretty much as long as untreated strings. The wound strings do last a while, however. I don't see the point, though, if you need to replace the plain strings often.Sound-wise, I can't comment, as I don't have magic ears and don't really hear much difference between string sets. After throwing your guitar through different pedals and signal processors and amps, does it really matter, anyway?That said, if longevity is what you're seeking, have a look at Elixirs. If not, stick to cheap, untreated strings. You'd be changing them as often as you would with Cleartones, it'd seem."
5,Interviews with Old Testament Men and Women,"What a wonderful way to get to know the Old Testament men and women. This is a way to help the 21st century person understand the Old Testament culture and the meaning of many of the OT symbolisms and customs. The authors ""interview"" many of the OT characters, such as Adam, Moses, Solomon and Judas Maccabeus. The authors also added biblical quotations, information on religious, social and historical issues of that day. At the end of the book is a time line chart and a section of short bios of other OT people.This book is written for teens and young adults, but is also very enjoyable and informative for adults. My husband and I teach RCIA classes, and use this information to help make the OT people come alive - especially to those who have no religious/biblical background. Our book has been borrowed by many of our ""students"" and every one of them has loved it.WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK FOR EVERYONE !!!!!"
2,Sad commentary on our society,"Don't know how I ran across this on Amazon. First was searching for Italian poets then saw this. Just sad. I have a friend who works in the ER and let me tell you - ""snuff"" films, extreme bondage, and violent sex towards women are real and they DON'T empower women!"
2,Battlestar Galactica The Plan,"After watching the series, which I thought was excellent, ""The Plan"" was a big disappointment. There was too much talk; I found it boring."
1,Not worth watching...,Nothing but a bunch of incoherent clips. Questions still remain and the plan was never fully revealed.
1,"DO NOT BUY THIS ""MOVIE""","As a original lover of the original BSG and a doubtful ""re-imagined' second BSG fan, who loved both, I can only say this...DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!!!!It is only a rehash of the series, nothing more. There are many unnecessary back flashes but nothing more.Sorry Mr. Olmos. I love you man...but you really ruined any cred you built up to being an Admiral.Where is President Roslin?!?!? A key integral part to the new BSG?!?!You cannot bask in the glory of yesteryear Mr. Olmos. I am so sorry on many levels.How about a new vision of the final five's journey throughout ALL time?"
1,This was horrible,"All this movie is is one of those filler episodes where the whole season was recapped. The recap is given through the eyes of a cylon which gave a somewhat unique take on things, but if this was a regular episode on tv I would have turned it off. This was so boring and had unnecessary nudity (male too). An utter waste of money and I agree with another reviewer that this was just released to milk fans of money."
1,I wish I could have my two hours back,"I'm a BSG fan from the 70's and I also love the new BSG. The series finally was one of the best TV shows I've even seen. The money I spent on ""The Plan"" I can never get back. To say this ""movie"" is a cut and paste puke fest is not doing it justice. If you saw the series then you saw 90% of this movie. None of the main characters were even in it. Or should I say in it much. The admiral had maybe three minutes of ""new"" shots and the chief was the big winner with about 7 minutes of new footage. 6 had a few gratuitous half naked shots so that might be good enough for some but not me. There was also several other gratuitous naked breast and butt shots so hide the kids eyes. Cylon No.1 Cavil was the big star and not very big at that. I'm going to re-watch the series finally so that episode will again be my final memory of BSG and I'll try and purge ""The Plan"" from memory."
1,Plan? What Plan??,"I know! The plan was to cash in on a lot of unsuspecting BSG fans who were forced to spend a lot of money for a clip show, made up from first season episodes. I am sure that SciFi thought it was a genius plan, but as a fan I have to say that it was just plain rotten. Maybe, just maybe the story looked actually decent on paper but it so didn't work on screen. There was no coherent plot line. The movie simply jumped from episode to episode and introduced new characters that we had never seen before. When the plan of the Cylons was revealed, I had to say that I was very disappointed. Not only because anyone who has ever read Milton will recognize it right away but also because it was childish and lame.To any fan who thinks about buying the movie: DON'T. It is a waste of money, it will add NOTHING to the BSG story and you will not enjoy watching ""The Plan""."
2,Completists will ignore...,"...what a disappointment The Plan is. The Cylon plan and machine-god monotheism are given short shrift and serve only to serve as skeleton, fleshed out by a pastiche of scenes from the four seasons of, in my opinion, the best drama series to air on television to date. There are no new revelations, and no significant changes in perspective or tone for the show. The Plan is little more than a clip show."
1,Another one star review for The Plan,"I first watched ""The Plan"" on DVD a few months after it was released. I was completely disappointed and vowed never to watch it again. But I just finished rewatching all four seasons of the main show a few days ago, so I decided to give ""The Plan"" a second chance.I'm both sorry and not sorry that I did. I am sorry that I watched it again because I can't get those two hours of my life back, but I am not sorry because at least I did TRY to like it.It's just not good.You know, I started writing a more in-depth review, but I deleted it because to finish it I would have had to spend yet more of my life thinking about ""The Plan.""Even if you are a hard core BSG fan, you do not have to watch ""The Plan"" for your life to be complete. Please trust me."
1,the plan,"one or two scenes from each episode of the series strung together to make a movie.Love the series,do not waste a penny on this movie."
2,Moderate to mediocre,"I saw this on TV and removed it from my wish-list after watching it. It's always fun to watch anything from the BSG realm, but the story on this one was disappointing. I fully expected to see a masterful plan orchestrated by the Cylon agents on Caprica. Instead, I just saw one more thread of the BSG story that filled in a few details I didn't know. There just wasn't much to it. Plus, you'll feel like a little bit of the mystery of the whole storyline is sucked out. The Cylons seem a bit less scary, more human, less machine, and generally lacking direction. Bottom line: watch it once; don't buy it."
3,the Plan ... good for collectors,"The plan isn't bad to fill in a few gaps. But if you've watched all throughout the series, you've seen most of this movie. It has many clips from episodes and little new material. overall a fun watch though..."
3,It was okay,"The Plan was okay, not great. First, you had to be a fan of the show. If not, you were watching an incoherent mess. I think the writers/producers new this was the case (how could they not), so that's fine. It's nice that they made it for the fans.But what I didn't like was that the story added very little to the overall arc. Some holes were filled in, yes, but nothing of any real note was presented.It was a good buy, but I won't be re-watching it anything."
2,It's a rehash...,I was very disappointed with this DVD. Instead of a new movie it is merely a re-editing of the series from the point of view of the Cylons. There is very little new footage and what there is are all dialogue scenes. In other words 'cheap' scenes. This reminds me of the 'clip' shows of old sitcoms in the 80's. New footage is merely there to bridge gaps between clips of old episodes. I loved the Caprica DVD and the regular series but this is just a shady way of getting more cash from old episodes.Not worth the money. Not even close.
1,from an avid BG fan - this is a menage of clips from the cutting room floor,"Wow, having just finished watching the series form beginning to end, I was thirsting for more. Well fans, this is not the place to get it. This is terrible. This is an exercise of how you take cutting room throw-aways and stitch them together with a storyline manufactured to accomplish the weaving. A bunch of cutting room clips intertwinced with a few new original scenes filmed to stitch this together. After seeing it, I wish I had not because what was left to the imagination before was better then this ""plan."""
2,Unnecessary and inconsequential,"""Battlestar Galactica: The Plan"" is a story that's both, now that the series has come to a definite conclusion, unnecessary and inconsequential. The main character appears to be Cavell, of all ""people,"" the most radical of the Cylons. Cut scenes featuring him and the other Cylons are interspersed with footage from the series to basically try to explain what they were up to during the human exodus. This may have worked out as a 2-hour special prior to the ending of the series, but even then I doubt fans would have been much more pleased with it than they are now. It's an add-on after the fact, and feels a bit non-canon as well. I'm a huge fan of both the original series and the remake, but i just could not get into this movie which doesn't compare to ""Razer"" at all. No matter how much of a fan you are of BG, skip this one."
2,Not horrible...just not so good,"The Plan wasn't horrible. It just wasn't that good. If you are a BSG fan, you'll probably buy this dvd like I did. But, don't expect alot out of it. It will give you a slight BSG fix.Prequels just don't work well. The story felt jumpy, rushed, and disjointed...like a collection of deleted scenes thrown together with some new stuff. Some of the special effects were even shaky. Way below the BSG standard.Without going into specifics, and (gasp) placing spoilers in this review, a few small questions were resolved. For example, the person who met with Six at the fountain. However, there are no big revelations or reveals in this movie. Just lots of Cavil and Anders with a little Six thrown in.In summary, you could skip The Plan and not miss anything.p.s. I heartily disagree with reviewers who say The Plan is better than Razor. Razor is head and shoulders better than this mediocre attempt."
1,Nearly Incomprehensible,"There is no Cylon articulation of the Plan here. There are no philosophical underpinings from the Cylon's perspective. Instead there are outtakes, footage from the original series, and a back drop plot that is nearly incomprehensible. New characters are introduced which have nothing to do with the original series, nor do they advance the plot. In one scene the timeline is incorrect with that twerpy scientist being on the Galactica before he was actually rescued from Caprica. Avoid this at all costs."
3,Meh,"As much as I was looking forward to this, I was surprised to find a flat plot and felt that it was nothing more than a clip show. I hope they do another, a more fitting coda to a great series than this."
5,Battlestar Galactica The Plan,This was a gift for my daughter. She was excited about getting this for Christmas because she didn't know she was.Good service came quicklyThank yousnoopylk
1,Pointless..,I lived and breath BSG for five seasons but this movie was a complete waste of time. It's a rehash of things that happened during the five years. In fact I think 50% of the movie is lifted from the show.If you are new to BSG do not buy this or even rent it. You'll be completely loss. The movie jumps from scene to scene without much meaning or reason. We find out that Number one is even sicker when he murders a little boy. This movie was just a complete waste of two hours of my life.I think I would have rather seen how they got along after coming to Earth then this.This movie adds nothing new. Very disappointing.
2,Skips around way too much.,"This thing skips around way too much to be entertaining. I suppose that the ADHD generation would enjoy it, but for those sound of mind, it skips around way too much. I watched the entire Battlestar Galactica(BG) series and this wasn't really a compliment to the series at all. I felt like it was mostly clips pieced together from the series along with some very short skits that they threw in to fill the story gaps. It really isn't worth $14 because it doesn't really tell any more than you would have already known at the end of the BG series. And for those who have never watched BG, ""The Plan"" will make absolutely no sense."
4,Battlestar Galactica: The Plan,"For those who have not figured out The Plan, while watching the TV series, this will explain. It was a neat movie to watch and I enjoyed how it tied all those little pieces together to give you the Plan."
2,So so,"I remember being very enthusiastic about watching this back-story spinoff movie. But I don't think it was worth all the hype. I found that the back story didn't add anything to the existing story, and actually created some confusion about the main BG plot lines. Save your shekels for something more interesting."
3,This is kinda cool,It was cool to watch this after the BSG series to see the cylons perspective. Parts of it were kinda cheesy but it was an interesting movie and addition to the series.
2,Big disappointment,"Let me preface this with the fact that I am a huge fan of Battlestar Galactica. I enjoyed every episode and came to terms with the ending after a couple of weeks. But this...compilation of unused film, previously used shots, and some new stuff...is a mess. There are some nice insights into the Cylon world and a couple of...""that's what was going on during that time"" revelations you'll experience, but it's mostly a frustrating empty piece that doesn't fill in any major gaps. Maybe if this was extended into a few episodes it would have been more complete and easier to follow. I got this dirt cheap, so I wasn't mad. If you haven't seen The Plan and you are needing a fix on Galactica, you can drop $2 or $3 on this and not be upset."
3,The Plan is decent,"BattleStar Galactica: The Plan is a decent re-viewing of what is already known and/or implied. Nothing new is really presented, but it's still somewhat interesting to see the other side of things (more or less)."
4,An Excellent Morsel for True BSG Fans,"The Plan is pretty much what it promised to be - the Destruction of the Colonies through the eyes of the Cylons. It does a great job of answering some of the mysterious questions that plagued seasons 1 and 2 of the series. However, don't expect anything super spectacular. It's a made-for-TV movie, and as such, the quality of the effects are a bit low. It's more like an extended episode than a movie, really. Much different thanBattlestar Galactica - Razor (Unrated Extended Edition)but still intriguing. Excellent performances all around, great writing worthy of the series. Worth the purchase for die-hard fans. Those who are less die-hard may want to wait until SyFy airs it on TV in 2010."
2,OK Movie - Terrible Blu-ray,"Battlestar was an outstanding series ... too bad those who product and market Battlestar are out to destroy it.Cylons, perhaps? The Plan is an OK movie that does fill in some of the back story of Battlestar ... Gene Stockwell doesa great job. BUT, the blu-ray quality is terrible. Fuzzy and grainy one moment, crystal clear the next.Wow. Way to ruin a another Battlestar offering. First, you cannot buy Battlestar per season in blu-ray.Next, the full series in blu-ray is badly packaged and seems like it is targeting dumb 12 year olds, not those intelligentviewers who loved the series (and will watch it numerous times). Now, the badly produced The Plan blu-ray. Really, it's Cylons: Only concerned with the money Machine not with humanities."
4,Fills In Some Gaps - Recommended,"""Battlestar Galactica: The Plan"" is sort of a recap and ""behind the scenes"" look at the Cylon thinking that went into the war against the humans. This straight to DVD movie uses a lot of footage from the series, but new scenes were added to expanded the plot with elements we learned later. A lot of new CG effects were also added, including showing more of the damage the first wave attacks caused to the colonies and the cities. There are a few scenes including nudity and sex, but it mostly is in good taste and used in the story telling.The extras on the DVD include a few deleted scenes, a look at the special effects, additional insights into the Cylons, and a commentary option. Don't watch the extras without watching the movie first because there are a lot of spoilers.Recommended for Battlestar Galactica fans, but only after watching all of the rest of the seasons.CFH"
3,It was disappointing,"I bought this DVD having watched the entire Battlestar Galactica series and was excited to see what new dimension was being added. Unfortunately, the plot and executiion of this installment left much to be desired and added nothing to the mythos of the show. Very disappointing!"
5,Battlestar Gallactica: The Plan,If you are a sci-fi fan or a follower of the Battlestar Gallactica series you will love this. There is lots of detail on motives and manipulations within the different Cylon models.If you are not a follower of the series this probably doesn't stand on it's own that well.As a member of the former group I thoroughly loved it.
1,Horrible,I love the new BSG but this was the worst movie that I have seen in a long while. It was just put together from a bunch of bad clips that did not make it into the original show. Do not waste your time with this. Razor was much better btw.
4,Subtle meditation on the futility of hate,"Masterful interweaving of old and new material...adds depth and richness to the spiritual/ethical themes of the series. If those themes resonated with you, this work has quietly enlightening rewards, seeing familiar characters wrestle with their dilemmas from fresh angles. If you were about the battles and 6's faux Marilyn Monroe act, move along."
3,not essential,"It was OK. I found it sort of uneven and hard to follow. Of course, it's been a while since seeing the first few seasons. I also bought BSG: The Complete Series so I'll watch The Plan again once I've watched the whole series again and hopefully it will be easier to follow. It was nice to have some questions answered, but I'd say the series stands on its own."
4,for fans,"In my opinion the Plan is a nice add-on for fans of the series, which I really admired. If you are not familiar with BSG, than you might become some problems in understanding the plan.But after all, I enjoyed watching it and get some more time with BSG."
3,Not Much of a Plan,"For those who can't get enough, you might like this story. There are some new twists here and there. But there some things lacking - especially a story around Kara Thrace who is virutually absent in the entire piece. Also, I would have like to see some new material on the origins of the final five. Oh well, nevertheless, the saga was great and one of the best pieces of scifi storytelling yet."
2,Dean Stockwell is Great--SPOILER ALERT,"When the series began, I was a voracious fan. When it ended, I was glad. ""The Plan"" doesn't add much to the series, and while there is some action, there is also much of the soul-searching that dragged the series into the abyss of sentimentality. Lots of this movie is rehashed from the first season, with some new footage focusing on Dean Stockwell's character, Number One. But the movie also doesn't jibe with the series. At the beginning of the film, we see Stockwell and other cylons walking among the as-yet-unresurrected Final Five before the strike on Caprica. In the series, though, they did not know who the final five were, not at first. They sought to discover their identity just as eagerly as the humans did.Stockwell, Olmos, and McDonnell were what was best in this series. It's good to see Stockwell get center stage here."
3,what's wrong with a little mystery?,"First, let me say that the problem I had with ""The Plan"" may for others be exactly what they're looking for. Namely, what is ultimately so compelling about the series is its depth and complexity. It's fun to work out the scenario and think about the philosophical implications the show raises. A part of the depth is the real-world quality of not having all the questions answered. So the problem I have with ""The Plan"" is that the clarifications are unnecessary and indeed can diminish the impact of the original. Having said that, there are a few revelations that came as a true surprise. However, mostly the revelations just serve to diminish the series. Having said that, I of course still love the series. And many people may dislike having loose ends and for them ""The Plan"" might be great."
3,Fair but not worth the price on Blu-Ray,'The Plan'I was and still am a BSG Fan. Yes it was nice to see who #6 was talking to. But $23.99 (Blu-ray) for a bunch of all ready recorded scenes splice with cut scenes and few few new scenes was way to much.(Spoiler if you haven't seen)Plus the ending also I found somewhat odd and leaves another unanswered question. The boy that befriended who befriended Brother Cavil on Galactica whose name was John which near the end of the 4th season of Galactica Brother Cavil's name was John. Was the boy a real person or was it Cavil's ultra-ego?Would I buy it again? Yes but definitly not the Blu-Ray version. Why pay the extra money...Over its a thumbs up but as a regular DVD Blu-Ray is not worth the extra $$$$
3,"Mostly patchwork, but some gems woven into it","Yes, this is most definitely a patchwork of previous BSG episodes, with bits in between that somewhat clarify or at least expand on various issues that are brought up. No big mysteries are solved. However, you do get to see more of what the Cylons were thinking, how they behave, what they thought they were accomplishing, etc. There is even a horrifying scene involving John and a young, lonely human boy. And the ending has a great voiceover about what a machine would want to do as it explores the universe.Not worth buying, but worth renting."
5,One Awesome DVD!!!!,"This is one awesome DVD. Any fan of BSG will LOVE this movie. It explains what's going on behind the scenes with the Cylons. After watching it, I went back and re-watched season 1 all over again -- things make SO MUCH sense!!! The Plan will fill in many all the gaps of why the Cylons are doing what they do, how they do it, and what their goals are. It also explains more of the conflict within the Cylons themselves -- the conflict between destroying all of mankind and living in peace with them.I highly recommend this DVD -- but DO NOT WATCH IT until you have seen all 4 seasons of BSG. So say we all."
5,Battlestar Gallactica the Plan,Excellent addition to the Battlestar Gallactica series. It was a prequel to the series and gave a lot of information about the people & the Cylons before the BSG actural TV series.
2,"Too much of a good thing, is a bad thing","This proves the old adage that too much of a good thing is a bad thing. This story would be better served to BSG super hardcore fans in novel form. While I appreciate being able to see it, I am not impressed with the acting, cinematography, and score. I think this would have been better as a filler 2 part episode in between the long wait of season 4 and season 4.5. Part of the reason I say this is plain economics. It's content is worth something about $4-$6 and not the $15-17 most retailers want."
3,For Fans Only,"If you are already a BSG fan and episode follower you will know exactly what's going on and be able to appreciate how ""The Plan"" fills in the gaps and shows what what was happening on the Cylon side of the war up to rescue of Sam Anders and his band of Rebels from Earth.On the other hand, if you have not seen at least the Mini-Series and the first few episodes of Season One then will not understand this film and think it has no plot. The scenes jump around from Caprica to BSG with no satisfactory explanation of who the Cylon's are and why the same ones keep popping up in so many places. Even I, who own all DVD's except Season's 3.5 and 4.5, was scratching my head at the Mother/Father references and was totally floored to discover that Ellen Tye was one of the Final Five. Yeah, something was said about them being the original creators, but since I hadn't seen the second half of Season Four or the final episode I didn't know what he was talking about at all."
1,Like watching paint dry?,"I am a huge SciFi fan. Star Wars, Star Trek, Time Cop...With a good movie, time flies, in fact, you hope a good movie would keep on playing, at least for another hour after the closing credits roll. And when it finally does end, you can't wait for the sequel/s.Battlestar Galactica: The Plan is the opposite of all that. I couldn't wait for it to end - thank God for the trusty fast forward button!Watching Battlestar Galactica: The Plan is almost like watching paint dry."
4,My least favorite Galactica entry.,"The Cylon attack has failed to wipe out humanity. There are 2 Cylon leaders with differing opinions on what to do about this unexpected turn of events. This movie is pretty good. It's cool to have a new perspective on things. The conflict within the Cylon ranks is awesome. Even though this is my least favorite Galactica entry, it's still an amazing movie. If you want to complete you Galactica collection you have to get this movie."
4,"Good, not great.","The story of this episode/mini-movie is basically the cylon side of Battlestar Galactica. It starts from right before the miniseries and ends at the end of season 2.5. If you want a complete collection, or you just can't get enough BSG, then this is for you. Otherwise, you might want to save it for netflix."
3,"As a director, Olmos is a fine actor.","If you're a BSG fan, you're going to watch this, regardless of what anyone says. If you're NOT a BSG fan, steer clear of this, go watch season 1.Battlestar Galactica - Season OneThere is actually an interesting story in here, that if you're a fan, you have to watch. (that's right, have to...it's an order)Be warned though, that there is way too much recycled footage, the pacing feels wooden and pedantic, and in his directorial debut, Edward James Olmos proves which side of the camera he belongs on."
2,Second rate,"Very disappointing. Didn't add much to the BSG universe; in fact, a sizeable portion of the footage seemed to be lifted from the series."
2,It's the Dean Stockwell show,"It seems like they add his character into scenes that we have already seen while watching the actual series. Little excerpts added to stuff we have saw already.Very boring, uninteresting and hard to sit though even for die hard fans.You know how it ends. No need to see this."
2,Disapointment,"I wanted to check this out as a series recap summary and found that perhaps viewing the entire series, rich in detail, story and emotional realism was spliced and diced to the movie format. It didn't work for me."
4,Flawed,Doesn't fit quite so nicely into the story line as I would have liked.If Number One knew what the five looked like why did he torture and maim Colonel Tye?Also why did the Cylons Search the temple to see the faces of the five?Otherwise an excellent episode.The destruction of the twelve colonies is particularly well done.Sorry to see the series finish.
4,good show,"i am a little biased to the original battlestar.when i heard scifi now syfy was doing a new battlestar, i was thinking they were going to pick up where the original left off and not a total remake.i didn't mind that they made starbuck a girl or anything else but it was done and done good the first time. they should had just picked up on earth and have the cylons find them on earth etc..."
3,"Not What I had Hoped For, but OK","Like so many others, I noticed that the Cylons could have wiped out the rements of the twelve colonies many times over in the four series. I had always expected that the Cylons purposely left some humans alive and pursued them to get these remaining humans to find Earth for the Cylons. This would allow the Cylons to then finally kill all the humans.So I was expecting this to have been the original Plan, later changed by the Cylons. The DVD instead doesn't really clear up the incentives of the Cylons but merely covers the actions of the Cylons in the fleet in the early seasons. ""The Plan"" doesn't really reveal much of a plan, but it is still decently entertaining."
3,"Not as good as had hoped, but still very watchable","We unknowingly bought the unrated version so there were a few 'surprises' in the form of genitalia exposure. Apart from that, I'm glad we bought The Plan. It was very insightful but was a little disjointed and still didn't answer some of the big questions. Hope there's more BSG to come."
3,The Plan Explained-Plain and Simple!,"Im a BSG fanatic from when I was 9 years old!! I love the original and Im fascinated by RDM's BSG. So Im never gonna bash BSG-NO!! Not me!!But I wont delve deep into the Plan either. let me keep it nice and simple: Its a good companion DVD to the miniseries and the TV series, Plain and simple, It has very little depth, very little character development so all it does is fill in the holes from Season 1-2 thats all. Plain and simple! It explains things-rather very simply- and it does it without fanfare. like how Shelly godfrey disappeared even with TWO colonial marines on her tail! or why Boomer shot the 'old man'. They are all rather simple explanations to a very deep and intriguing story from the minisries. Not much time and effort was spent on details with this one. So all that the Plan does is it narrates and explains things we were all curious about. Do you go see it? YES. Should you buy it to see it? NO, just rent it and save $20!! So say we all!!"
2,I can't believe it was so awful,"The Blu-Ray quality was great. The special effects were outstanding. The acting was as good as the series. My main disappointment was with the story. I am a huge fan of Battlestar Galactica so I have watched every episode ever made multiple times. So I was very disappointed when I watched ""The Plan"" and discovered myself pausing the movie midway through to check how much time was left before it was over. Yes. It was that bad. The story line was generally uninteresting. In my opinion, this movie is the ""Galactica 1980"" of the re-imagined series. No, there weren't any flying boy scouts in this one ... but there was a snap-zoom on a nude man's private parts. A die-hard fan, such as myself, will still want to add this movie to their collection. All the rest should just wait till it comes on TV or rent it."
2,Doesn't quite work,"After a promising start, it rapidly fades. For me, the Cavil character isn't strong enough to carry the film. A few explanations for issues unresolved in the series but that's about all. The rest is just a load of badly cobbled together scenes from the excellent series This should have been part of the BR box set and not an extra. As a plan it's half baked."
1,There is no plan...,"In a word... Awful.The entire movie plays like one big 'clip show' episode, the kind one would expect at the tail end of a season when production costs are running a little over budget.Yes, one does get the Cylon perspective of the first battle and subsequent scenes from the few seasons. In the end, however, we wind up not caring one 'frakking' bit for any of them - human or Cylon. The scenes just keep jumping around from location to location.Mind you, there are some solid moments with Simon, underused Cylon model #4 and also a few nice bits from Dean Stockwell. Otherwise, one is left feeling cheated. They should have focused on fewer Cylon characters with deeper storylines.Plan? What plan???This is a movie without a plan...What a mess and what a shame.Watch at your own peril."
3,The Cylon Plan,"In general, this is just a rehash of what was gone before. I found the ""change in perspective"" less satisfying than it might have been with a little more effort in editing and story developement. I had to have it - to complete the collection - and would probably buy it again if I had it to redo. Even though it was uninspired, there were a few places where the alternate point of view added to the understanding of the storyline. And, the quality of the source material is a plus."
1,The worst Battlestar Galactica ever!,"Very little action and it's covering things we've pretty much already seen in the series. If I were you, I'd stick with season 4.5 to end my Battlestar Galactica collection.Not recommended!"
2,What Plan just bad editing of old clips,"If your looking for some sort of revelation that a Plan really existed your wasting your time, this is just a rehash of old clips coupled with some bridging scene's and a tiny tiny bit of extra info into what was going on behind the scenes. If your a true Fan you will watch this and be seriously dissapointed, but if you just want towatch another scifi show then this is a good way to kill 2 hours or lul you to sleep."
2,Not much new,"I was disappointed with the minimal new content in this DVD, - it felt like it was just a vehicle for Edward James Olmos to try directing and an excuse to reuse the sets while waiting to do Caprica.The actual ""Plan"" which I had hoped would be some complex, revealing twist turns out to be a complete anticlimax (I'm trying to stop short of spoiling it if that's possible.)It was a little interesting to see (almost) all of the Cylon models with enough frequency to actually keep track of which is which. In the long run, I'd say the missing element was an actual plot line. Most of the footage was old which could be deemed an excuse to not be able to introduce a new story ... but anyone who has seen ""Dead men don't wear plaid"" knows it can be done. <-- (I'm guessing that's the first time *that* movie was referenced in the same conversation as BSG :-0)"
2,Nope,"A new director - edward james olmos, sure knows how to absolutely maul the great series. I'm a huge battlestar fan, have bought every episode on dvd. But this is just awful, and boring. Only one big revelation is revealed. The rest is filled in with closeups of peoples' faces and flash backs of scenes already seen. Ge this movie if you want a sense of completion to your collection, not if you want to be entertained."
2,not so good realy.,"For real fans of BG this will be a little disapointing, lots of clips from the first series tied together with a weak story line. This movie does damage to the reputation acheived by the series, not so good realy."
4,What were you expecting,"Everyone who says how bad this is needs to relax. This is an interesting take on part of the story. It's not the best thing ever put to film but it was entertaining, nonetheless."
2,"BSG's Dean Stockwell Hour, w/nudity","I just watched this for the first time after waiting for quite a while to finally see it. I loved the series! This however, lacked any, and I mean ANY of the outstanding drama and action of the series. And for whatever reason, because it did absolutely nothing to further the story, the creators decided tho throw in a few gratuitous nude shots of women, and even a quick zoom on one guy's appendages, just because they could I suppose.As far as the story goes, there was nothing to be learned here. It was completely predictable, except for the parts where Cavil gets to ""get it on"" with the younger hotties. I did NOT need to see that.If you're a huge fan of Dean Stockwell and thought he needed more exposure in the series, they more than make up for it here. But if you're looking for a good solidly entertaining BSG fix... good luck."
3,Disappointing,I have enjoyed all the rest of BSG but this was too slow and boring. It would have been one star less without the brief nudity.
1,What a waste!,"If you have seen the entire series this is a waste of time and money - don't bother with the ""plan""."
1,not worth the time,"basically just a of series of deleted scenes thrown together in a pitiful attempt to create some back story, make a little more money, and kill whatever lingering fondness anyone had for this series. ignore this and let well enough alone."
1,Disgraceful in every sense,"How could they follow up one of the greatest Series ever to come out on television with such a poor put together disgrace of a film.The film plays like a montage of BAD Deleted Scenes put together with classic clips from the Series. I was really looking forward to this and had bought the Series on Blu-ray and watched every episode to get me ready for this.It is an atrocity and a slap in the face to the fans. The new scenes were just horrible. The special effects must have been done by someone else as they stuck out like a sore thumb.Do yourself a favor and wait till it comes on Sy-Fi before purchasing this. I really wish I hadn't seen it as it really ruins a television show that was so great but having this as the last ""new"" BSG to be released.Truly saddened by this release."
1,BSG: The Plan......Failed Miserably,"You have no idea how much I was jonesing for a BSG fix. Then, I bought this pile of crap. Really!!!! That's the best they could come up with? A bunch of crap we've already seen, but lets add in the icky old man all over the place. I hope EJO can look himself in the eyes after putting his name on that big pile of steamy poo. How did it go so wrong? Why, why why!!!!!!!I feel better. Hope this helps."
2,Disapointing,"Being a big BSG fan, I pre-ordered this. This was a disapoitingly written script and just seems to milk fans of more money after the series ended. If I had known how bas it was, I would have passed on buying it. It wasn't worth the money or the space to keep it to know about the missing parts of the plan. For those that do not already own or have carefully watched all 4 seasons, it would be very difficult to follow what is going on."
2,Hurts me to say this: it's not good.,"I love, and mean love, Battlestar Galactica. It hurts me to say it, but this strikes me as the lowest point of the whole re-imagined series. It looks like they had a bunch of good ideas and tried to do all of them, failing to execute any of them well.I will say, if you're a fan of any of the Cylon Characters who never saw much development, you can definitely see it here. If you're a Sam Anders fan there's some fan service here as well, but otherwise it's just blah. There's an interesting retroconned side character who is married to a Cylon and spends a brief chunk of time with the Chief, but it's so brief it can't carry the whole two hours.There's even times I have issue with the special effects, which is the first time I can say that.And as far as it answering the big questions, like who put the ""12 cylon models"" in Adama's cabin, it doesn't even really do that."
2,Just a Re-Run - nothing really original,I watched this The Plan last night on the SYFY channel and thought I would buy the movie once I saw the quality. It is just a re-configuration and re-run of past clips. I found it quite boring. I love scifi and and I'm very forgiving if a program has a few problems. I would suggest watching it free somelace if you haven't seen it. The most I'll pay for this program on-demand is $2. It is not a $15 movie. I did buy all the BSG series and they are worth the price on-demand. I do love on-demand at Amazon.
2,Overmilking the Cash Cow,"This episode was penned by Jane Espenson, who I actually think is one of the weaker sci fi screenwriters today. She's always sentimental, never scary, and writes male characters like large neutered house cats.If you are so jonesing for BSG that you are willing to sit through half repeat scenes/half scenes that should have seen the chop block, then you will probably still like this. But if, like me, you were hoping for insight into the psyche and earlier motivatins of the Cylon, then you will be BORED and dissatisfied halfway through when you realize that there is no substance here.And the dialogue is atrocious. Brother Cavil is the lead and some of his one-liners are abominably bad. Yes, he actually says, ""Let's get this genocide started."" Wow."
1,Even completionists should avoid this one,"Every series has its bad moments, but if you're enough of a fan, you can usually forgive and maybe even enjoy the crappy bits, because you love the show warts and all. Battlestar Galactica, especially Season 4, had more than its share of narrative cul-de-sacs, filler episodes, and infodumps, but it was what it was, and it was all part of the Battlestar package. The Plan, on the other hand, is so bad that it actually ruins the rest of the series. The Season 4 finale, which was criticized for being obsessively conclusive (everything explained and happy endings all round!), has nothing on the shoddily-written fan fiction that is The Plan, which manages to explain away any mystery and magic that the series still had.Don't watch it, because once watched it can never be unwatched."
1,If You Love BSG...Skip The Plan,"It gives me no pleasure to report that The Plan is simply awful. Yes, you'll learn some back story elements - but mostly you'll find yourself in a mire of bad writing, impenetrable structure and hammy acting. I'm an enormous BSG fan, and not once in the run the series (well, maybe that episode with all the boxing) did I have that clammy moment when I said to myself, ""This is terrible."" It happened with The Plan. And if the series had been like this...I would have found me an airlock."
2,Bah,"In case you care....SPOILERS BELOW.Here's the plan:KILL ALL HUMANSHere's the plan Part 2:OOPS, SOME GOT AWAY. KILL THEM TOO.Stay away. Nothing new, except for more Cavil. Let this great series go gracefully."
3,A little bit of this....a little bit of that....,"When I bought this DVD I was expecting to get a few answers to the questions that were not answered during the 4+ seasons of BSG. I was hoping that the reveal of the Cylon ""Plan"" in it's entirety would explain the plot threads that were not tied up. I really wanted to know what happened to Kara Thrace when she was captured and held at the farm? What were they doing to her?But what I got from this movie was a flashback to life on Caprica and in the colonies before the Cylon attack and a bunch of new ""never before seen, deleted scenes"" added to original, season 1-4+, footage to fill in the pieces of what Cavil, Simon, and Anders for the most part experienced off screen . I never got the feeling of a continuous story that made this final movie worthwhile.If you're a BSG fan and a completest you have to watch this, but otherwise you can skip this and be just as happy."
2,At best a clip show with very little new revelations,"I absolutely love BSG! However, ""The Plan"" stunk. It was 80-90 % clips and the new scenes added almost nothing to the story. Further, in many cases the new scenes did not visually mesh with the clips they were supposed to be adding to."
1,"Maybe name it ""Cavil's Tantrum""???","The Plan...long anticipated for it's promise of providing some answers to questions left over from the series.So what was the grand ""Plan"" often mentioned in each episodes sign on?""Kill all the humans""DUH!So that was Cavil's grand plan? I had kind of guessed that after the mini-series. So the plan fails when a fleet of humans escape and the rest of the show is Cavil bumbling around trying to finish the job, and still failing. Then Caprica Cavil shows up, and tells Fleet Cavil they were wrong because they forgot to factor in ""love"" and the show ends.And I just wasted 20 dollars to learn what I already knew at the beginning of the whole mess. They promised that the end would be so mind blowing that it would make you re-think the entire series and be forced to re-watch it from the start with your newly unveiled eyes. They (the writers) failed.So lets make a 2 hour time sink and blame it all on Cavil!!!"
5,Battlestar Galactica Back Story,"This is a combination new and old film that ""answers questions you didn't know you wanted to ask."" We all know that The Plan failed, but this is an excellent back story that fleshes out the problems the cylons had with trying to make the abortive attack on the colonies complete.Directed by Edward James Olmos, with his knowledge and love of the series, this is a must for Battlestar fans for the details it gives. Newcommers will enjoy The Plan, as it stands on it's own quite well, but a lot of the nuances will be lost on them. I, for one, loved the series, and this movie was just what I needed while waiting for ""Caprica"" to start."
4,"Once you're hooked, ya gotta have more...","This was fun, and did fill in quite a bit of background that, in retrospect, helps us understand more fully what the characters were going through, especially the cylons aboard the Galactica. I have to admit that my wife chose not to watch it because she was so taken by the season finale that she didn't want to reopen these characters again. A ""must have"" for any hard core fan, however."
3,SAME OLD REHASH SUMMARY OF BG PAST FOUR SEASONS,Although I enjoyed this movie more than CAPRICA it still left a bad taste in my mouth primarily because the movie was simply a crafty editing of alot of old clips mixed in with a few new ones. It was a mere attempt to make some further profit by using many original scenes that we have seen blended with some new clips. It was okay to watch once especially for the great CGI effects of the cylon base stars mounting their attack on the twelve colonies. Other than that the ending was simply too abrupt and not any of a real surprise. By a used copy if you want to complete your BG DVD collection so as to save a few bucks.
3,It was OK. Did not feel like BSG.,"I loved the series. I even liked ""Razor"". I never missed an episode. Half way through ""the Plan"" I got a phone call and did not finish watching it until the next day (that would have never happened with an episode). It was nice to see some new material, but in the end it did not answer any questions I wanted answered. Seemed more like a clip show at times since the new material was not very exciting or changed how you interpreted the show. It did not seem like much of a ""plan"" to me. Maybe I am bitter over the way the series ended. And maybe that is the point. We know how it ends. Story over. Maybe that is why I didn't get into ""Caprica"" either. I really did liked the new take on the opening theme. :)"
3,"""Battlestar Galactica: The Plan""","""Battlestar Galactica: The Plan"" was just a setup for a series. There will be a running theme of ""Is he/she human or machine?"""
2,Not great. Not what you want to end with.,"I recently watched the whole series on Netflix and loved it. I was excited to hear that there was an additional movie, and even though I knew it wasn't going to be great, I really just wanted more BSG. I had pretty low expectations and I was still really disappointed. In the end I wished I hadn't watched it at all and didn't have to end the series with such a sour taste in my mouth."
3,I loved the show,"I really did and I like that they filmed extra scenes at the same time they did the series but this doesn't fill like a movie. It's more like a bunch of extra scenes put together. I think it would have been better if they included some scenes from the series because it feels a little disjointed. I liked seeing things from the cylon side of things, and I don't regret buying it. I think I paid five bucks maybe? So it was worth it, I'm just a little dispointed because it had the potental to be more."
4,"Good, but not great","While not as bad as I had anticipated after reading other reviews here, it certainly wasn't as ""good"" as what I had come to expect from the BSG series...hands down one of my favorite shows of all time. The first 15 or so minutes were definitely the highlight as some others have suggested. I applaud the BSG gods for attempting such a unique ""flashback"" as they have done, and although it was not as gratifying as I had hoped, it wasn't as bad as I expected."
3,bof !!!!!,bof rien d'exceptionnel dans ce dernier chapitre ce n'est qu'un épisade a ralonge.. juste pour les fans
1,Sheets won't hold their color,"I ordered these sheets and after washing them eight times, still ended up with pink underwear and a pink mattress pad. I was very disappointed in this specific color and have returned them."
3,mediocre,"This product is ok. I thought it would be songs from the movie which it is not. The music is pleasant enough, but not what we expected. Also, the seller indicated it was in ""new"" condition and it was clearly not new. It was a very worn copy."
1,Not as advertised,"This keyboard cover is NOT for the Powerbook G4. The powerbook's keys are beveled along the edges, and this cover is made for a macbook or new macbook pro, which has more square-edged keys. The picture is very misleading, as it does show the correct cover. The seller does not even have the correct cover, so don't waste your time."
2,Be Aware,"I bought this cover for my late 2006 MacBook Pro. The quality and ease of use are fabulous but the fit is horrible. I mean, it fits ok and is usable but it slips and slids and doesn't fit the keyboard well at all. I don't recommend it."
2,"Functionality okay, looks a bit ugly.","Fits well, nice tactile typing feel, BUT this cover makes the keys look unevenly frosty, almost in a blotchy, oily kind of way. I am going to try a different keyboard membrane that is more translucent."
4,"Short, but cute","My son has the board book and liked the illustrations. I'm irked though by a Pteranodon picture being called a Pterodactyl, though this mismatch is hardly unique to this book -- and of course neither were dinosaurs, but that's even more widespread. Sure, the distinction isn't critical for a 22 month old, but it's ironic in a work that carefully includes pronunciations."
2,Wrongheaded vehicle for comedian Hill,"This is one of those American produced films that showcase a European star (in this case, Italian Terence Hill) with the idea of promoting his fame in the US while ignoring everything that made him famous in his home country (like a Jackie Chan film with boring American fight choreography). Terence Hill became known for his slapstick comedy spoofs like ""They Call Me Trinity"" and ""Crime Busters"" but there is practically no slapstick here; just a 70's chase film with practically nothing to distinguish it from a dozen others (except that it has fewer chases than most!) Check out Hill's other films instead."
3,Why did you change the product?,"Why did Jason change this product. Not as rich or orange smelling and more greasy than the original. All the reviews on the previous kind were positive, why change a good thing???"
1,THE NAY-SAYERS WERE RIGHT,"This caulk strip by Red Devil looks like a great alternative to caulking up the space where the bathtub meets the tile in your bathroom--that is, until you use it and test it out. Wow, how I'm sorry I used this!Although it's not too hard to apply and it initially looks very good in less time that it would take to apply regular caulk, this caulk strip has an absolutely wonderful ability to slowly peel away (on the reverse) from the space it's supposed to seal. It's practically a guarantee that you'll have a leak below your bathtub, behind tile or water anywhere else you didn't want water to go.I don't care how many times Red Devil claims that this has no ""messy cleanup;"" it's just not true. Oh sure, there's no messy cleanup the day you apply this caulk strip--but just wait until it starts to peel away on the reverse (where you might not be able to notice it peeling right away) and let water through--THEN you'll have a REALLY messy cleanup!Stay away."
1,Mold factory. Good Earwig Trap,"Bought this item because I thought that it would look nice in our tub. It was not difficult to apply and I followed all of the directions. First I noticed that the tape was not very stickly. One would have assumed that something that is meant to keep water out would be very sticky. I applied the product properly and not too long after, maybe one month I noticed that it would separate from the tub wall. The strip that I had applied to the bottom of the tub on the floor also separated eventhough there wasn't much water to hasten the seperation process. Then I noticed that there was BLACK MOLD as the strips had seperated from the wall and allowed and trapped water behind it. There were also EARWIGS that were trapped behind it which was gross but at least the strip did some good. I went back to simple white caulk and that is what I will continue to use. I would not recommend this for a substiution for regular caulk but I would recommend this for an effective Earwig trap."
1,A total disappointment for a child,"The moment it came out of the box I found the ""water"" hand on the floor... There is a bag which you must filled with water. By the time you can hook this bag back on the place it's almost empty, because you keep pushing on it so it seats right on the place...A total disappointment for a child, who waits for whole apperation and as reward gets one lousy squirt form broken hand. What a waste of money!!!!"
5,Great Fun!,"I bought this book for my 4-year old son and he loves it! My husband and I love reading it to him and his baby sister who often also listens along. The book is educational yet great fun to read with its rhyming and fun verses. It teaches without being heavy-handed and even taught us, the parents, a thing or two we didn't know about the insect world! We all enjoy this book tremendously and love the other Cat in the Hat Learning series books as well."
5,All about insects by Cat in the Hat library,You can't go wrong with the Cat in the Hat series of books. This one lives up to the high standard of excellence in every way. It even makes you love bugs! A great buy from Amazon.com.
3,"Factual, but poor rhyming","This is not one of the best books in the series. While it is factual, the rhyming is sloppy--in one stanza a word is rhymed with itself and in another stanza, the word from the beginning of the next phrase is placed at the end of another phrase so that the stanza will rhyme. All in all, this type of sloppy rhyming is extremely disappointing coming from the ""Cat in the Hat""!"
2,Not Seuss,Don't be fooled into thinking these are Dr. Seuss books; they are knockoffs done after Geisel's death. The rhymes are not nearly as good as real Seuss; I stumble over the awkward lines every time I read it.
5,Marvelous Mustela,"I love Mustela products!!!! And this product is no exception. I used this for my toddler when she was a baby and then ventured off and tried various other products such as Sebamed,which is also great! But one day while bathing my daughter, I found a sample bottle that I had received in one of the Mustela orders; when I smelled this stuff, I was in awe and love again. It reminded me of when my baby (3.5 years old) was an actual baby and reminded me how much I love this product and the smell! It never created any rash or any other harsh reactions and the smell is heavenly! So needless to say we are switching back to Mustela for my baby, but also for me. I always want nothing but the best for my baby and Mustela is the best!"
2,Only Fudges Some Major Facts,"This book is interestingly written in 'street' prose, with certain lines and bits emphasized and then re-emphasized to hit home. This story will help a reader looking to find a first hand perspective into the Black Panther movement of the sixties and into the Philadelphia police nightmare of the seventies. As long as you approach this book knowing that Mumia is NOT a political prisoner (he is a murderer) and was NEVER silenced for writing the truth (he spread vicious libel throughout his career as a journalist), and you look into those facts for yourself, then this book can be for you what it is for me... a dishonest biography of a man set against an honest background of the turbulant and nightmarish time for African- Americans in the years following the Civil Rights Movement."
2,Misleading,"This is not a bad collection of Irish songs, but severely disappointing if you were expecting to hear a lot of bodhran (Irish drum). And wouldn't you expect to hear a lot of bodhran on an album named for this instument?It appears to be a collection of cuts on which Murphy contributed his talents to other musicians which were thrown together from a variety of sources. That wouldn't be so bad, except you can hardly make out any bodhran on most of them. Granted, it's a background instrument, but if the album is titled ""An Bodhran"" you'd expect to be able to hear the drum featured pretty promimently. But if you did expect that, you'd be disappointed, as I was.If you want another CD of pretty decent Irish folk music, this is not bad. But if you want to experience the bodhran, get anything by the Chieftans. Most of their albums have at least one or two cuts where the bodhran is pretty prominent, which is more than can be said for ""An Bodhran."""
1,Where's the Bodhran?,"The cover, title, and information on the album suggests a Bodhran player is ""featured"" on the CD. Unfortunately most of the instruments drown out Murphy's talents."
2,Not the bodhran of the Chieftans!!!,"With nothing to go on but the title, I expected the drum to be the main sound. This may be a good album of Irish music; I am not commenting on that one way or another. The liner notes say: ""...[the accompanist] wishes to contribute significantly to the music without taking over from the melody player."" The bodhran is so much in the background that it is indistinguishable from spoons in the majority of cuts. It is more evident in a couple of cuts where it is accompanying a flute. For me, the price is not worth just those cuts. I wanted the bodhran to take over from the melody!!! Its title says it's a drum album, after all!"
4,"Not a prominent bodhran in every song, but...","Where it's proudly ringing it's a beautiful thing in this collection. I was particularly impressed with ""Citi na gCumann"" which I had only heard once before and hated. I wanted to hate this version, too. In spite of my best efforts it grew on me and has become one of the most played songs on my iPod. I only wish I spoke Irish so I could sing along.True, the bodhran gets short-changed a little on this CD, but overall it's a very good collection of well-struck tunes. I have no complaints."
1,"Useless for learning, but pleasant listening","As has been stated, the title is misleading.The music is good, but the drumming is difficult to hear, and impossible to learn from."
4,"Software is a pig, hardware is good",The reviews are all correct - if you can install the software the first time you will be fine. I did the full install (780Mb! - nothing should be that big) and it failed to see the scanner leaving me scannerless. My brand new P4 3.3Ghz with 512Mhz of RAM running XP started to freeze and crash. I had to uninstall everything and reinstalled the minimum install and everything worked. The majority of the full install is HP's image software which you don't need if you have any other photo software - it takes up about 300Mb. Now that everything works I really like the printer but HP needs to wake up and hire some programmers who are not as fat and lazy as their software.
3,worked great on old computer,"This printer worked great on my old computer with XP windows, was easy to install.However with my new HP computer with windows 7 it will not install. I got it to print but I can't install the software that comes with it. I wonder if it's the windows 7 it is not liking. I don't have the scanning software now, all I can do is print and copy. Anyone have any ideas?"
2,Pretty good.... until it died,"I had this printer for a couple of years. For the most part it did the job for me and I was happy with its performance. Networking with an ethernet cable so that all the mac and PC machines in my house could print to it was fairly easy....Then last week it said I had a paper jam in the carraige. After hours spent diagnosing the problem online and going through step after step to fix it, nothing worked. There is no paper jam... there is just a printer that no longer works because it thinks there is a paper jam.I've decided to give the Canon MX700 Office All-In-One a try. It's brand new so not many reviews out for it yet but I've heard good things about the Canon's and this one seems to do everything I need for only $200 dollars. I'll try to review it here on Amazon after a few months of use."
4,HP Photosmart 2710,I loved this photo printer so when my boss wanted one for her desk this was the first printer that I wanted to purchase.
2,"Miserable, timeconsuming drivers","The printer is fine. Fast and clear.But ... setting-up the printer (for network connectivity) was miserable. And what motivates me to write my first ever review is the ""Update Wizard"". Today, out of the blue, it asked me to update. Then it proceeded to beat on my hard disk for 2 hours. I called Support, and they instructed me to kill the ""Update Wizard"". Then they informed me that I should have checked the HP website to verify that there were updates for my make and model, before I allowed the ""Wizard"" to proceed. After a reboot, the ""Wizard"" wanted me to update again, but I was told just to cancel that.I've had other configuration hassles, but I've forgotten the details.So, this is a fine printer, if you don't mind periodically spending a couple of hours hassling with the configuration."
4,Excellent Printer - Install Carefully,"Bought the 2710 about a month ago. Installed easily (wired network), works beautifully. Photos look great even without special photo cartridge! Only recently tried to use scanner and found that it did not work. Other system prolems were also apparent. After lengthy investigation with tech support, we determined that problem was interference from McAfee during install (although I had 'disabled' it). Uninstalled Mcafee, reinstalled software; now works perfectly. An excellent product! I just wish tech support was in the US (got a follow-up call from them at 1:00 am this morning!)."
3,"pretty good, with exceptions","I've had my printer for 5 months now. I find it to be a great piece of equipment. I only have two exceptions:1. No feeder tray. The printer does not have a feeder tray for multi-page faxes or copies. You must load one sheet at a time on the flatbed screen.2. I just recently ran through 5 color cartridges in an attempt to print 150 color copies. The kicker is that my document's main color was green. So, when that ran out, I had to replace the entire cartridge. That was pretty irritating to me."
1,hp 2710 multifunction,"I rev'd this for a christmas present and used it very little, all of a sudden the carriage quit. I called HP and talked to a man that I couldn't even understand, but basically he told me it wasn't worth fixing buy a new one. So I did I bought a Canon. That will be my last HP.bubblee from KC,KS"
1,Beware! Will not even do its primary function!,"An ordeal of many months finally comes to an end with me paying for the machine's return to HP and still looking for a printer. That is after 3 replacements and even a second model which ultimately failed as well.The machine worked fine with only minor glitches which finally developed into total failure. HP's support simply had me resetting the machine over and over taking several hours before replacing it with a machine which didn't work either. HP's support then agreed to pay me back for the purchase of a replacement model (it was discontinued) but then decided not to pay me (after I purchased).Result: I returned all machines involved, one at my expense, and am looking at an Epson.Summary: Out of the box, it is not reliable and HP has no reliable support to help set up its primary function: wireless printing.Never HP ever again. 2 Printers, 2 iPAQs, 2 Laptops: all needing to be shipped back over the past 4 years. Total failure."
1,Piece of [...],"This is the biggest piece of [...]printer I ever bought. I bought an extended warranty...which in the long run didn't help. Within a year of buying this thing you call a printer, it broke. It just stopped working. I got an even exchange with an argument through the store I bought it with. The ""brand"" new second one I had broke in four months. I turned it on one day and just lines through the display.Same thing as other reviews: I stayed on the phone with HP for over two hours with someone in India who didn't know how to speak English and never got a replacement. The same with the warranty..they did send me a ""refurbished"" one that was scratched on the scan bed part and it actually looked like someone spit all over it. I sent it back and from then on out I never heard anything back nor can I get anyone to help me with this expensive piece of printer.NEVER WILL I BUY ANOTHER HP PRODUCT AGAIN!!!!"
1,Software is so bad that Photosmart 2710 is painful to use,"Based on the specifications, I thought that the HP 2710 all0-in-one would be a great product. Now that I have it, the software has been such a problem that I often can't use PhotoSmart 2710 as advertised.A few times, the printer stopped working from my computer. I had to uninstall and reinstall the printer software to make it work. Installing the software takes well over an hour even though my computer has a 2.6GHz processor.The software even causes problems when I'm not trying to print. I sometimes got error messages from the software when I was doing tasks totally unrelated to printing. In summary, the specifications are great, but the software is so bad, that the specifications advertised are irrelevant for someone really using the printer. If I have to spend an hour uninstalling and reinstalling software to make printing wirelessly work, I would rather just have a simpler, more reliable printer."
2,Major Scanning Problem,"I am using the 2710 in a Mac environment. It works well except for one major design oversight. It will not scan a multi-page document into a single PDF file. If you have a ten page form or document that you need to scan into PDF so you can email it off to your lawyer or broker or whatever, you end up with ten PDF files, one for each page. Ridiculous. The response from HP was that since the product does not have a document feeder, it can only scan one page to one file. That makes no sense whatsoever. It could easily be the case that you need to scan pages from a book or other material that will not go through a document feeder anyway. Besides, flatbed scanners of all ilks (including HP) can be used to scan many pages into a single file. The worst part is that it would be a trivial software tweek to enable it to do the right thing but their latest driver (June 2006) does not fix this glaring oversight."
2,Save your money - buy a different printer!!!!,"This printer is very disappointing, mostly due to the very flawed software. Installation was horrific, crashed my computer a few times. Had to totally disable Norton Anti-Virus and Internet Security during the installation. Scarry...Doesn't seem to matter if printer is connected wirelessly or to a hub/router, doesn't function properly either way. Printing is ok, but forget about scanning. I can't even scan from the scanner itself even though the printer finds the network. After uninstalling and reinstalling the drivers and many calls to tech support, still doesn't work.I don't see why anyone should purchase this printer. It prints decently but is severely flawed as an all-in-one solution."
1,This printer is simply garbage! Stay away from it.,This will be the last time I buy a HP or any HP products.Thier customer service lacks on top of it.This printer is the worst!First of all it has problems with any PC...and its primary function does not even work right.How HP gets away with selling stuff like this is beyond me but they will never get me again.It was fun running over it wih my truck!!!!HP you suck!!!!
3,Instructions are not accurate.,Only works with a threaded fitting. Instructions are incorrect. Other than that the product functions correctly and the quality is adequate.
5,Check your pipes first!,"I didn't bother to check my pipes before buying this and was surprised when I found a different fitting than either of the ones the manual described. I had a proprietary fitting from Delta that had a welded on washer and threads. I was able to cut that off to give myself a bare copper pipe and this slid right on. Works perfectly, the diverter works wonders compared to my old one, also really long to get over the side of my tub. The chrome had a much better feel and appearance than the plastic-y thing I was replacing."
4,arrived broken but they made it right,"It arrived broken due to poor packaging. However, they sent me another one. Alls well that ends well. I lost a little time and thats oll. willie"
1,Made of MDF - NOT WOOD - BUYER BEWARE,"We bought this item per the information on Amazon - that it is made of solid wood. We have been using it for a while and it still has a smell to it, especially when the doors are left open. I called Melissa and Doug today and was told that it is MDF, not solid wood, hence the smell (I'm very sensitive to MDF/Particle Board). Amazon WILL NOT stand by it's information and help me since it's past the return policy. It really stinks that a company as big as Amazon will not stand by the information it provides on it's products... who knows what you're really getting, especially when it's painted over and not apparent to the naked eye!"
5,Great Quality,"The quality on this kitchen is great. Strong, durable product that can handle the rough treatment it will likely get. Assembly takes time since there are lots of pieces to put together, but the instructions are very clear and the quality shows in the precision of the manufacturing so the pieces line up exactly. Good value."
2,"Great for the first week, but then...","This is an excellent idea for a toy, and my three kids (ages 7-4) loved it. Too bad it's built more shoddily than the average dollhouse. The hinges bend, the screws are too short, what few pieces are actually put together for you are sloppily assembled and fall apart with light use. Remember also that you need several hours to assemble the thing yourself.I understand it's a toy, but for $160, you can sure do better. No one would accept something this shoddily built even in a much cheaper piece of furniture. It's only because this is a toy that the manufacturers can get away with bad quality for a huge price."
4,A Great Gift for your Cooking Kid,"This product met all my wife and I's expectations for construction, ease of put together and especially the fun factor for our child. For those that wrote about long assembly times they must have had too much holiday cheer or are simply not mechanically inclined. This product was together in less than one and a half hours. Well worth the money for a non plastic, non Chinese made toy."
2,Definitely takes skills to put together,"I bought this product to be used at work in play therapy w/ children. It definitely does the job, but it was a real pain to put together. We actually probably would have sent it back, but since it was already all the way out of the packaging, and we're on a tight budget and couldn't afford to send it back and look for another as cheap as this one, we decided to keep going. My husband, who fortunately makes furniture for a living, was kind enough to come in and fix it. It was missing some of the pre-drilled holes and some of the holes that were there were drilled poorly and had to be fixed. One of the bolts also broke on us. The materials used are really shoddy -- some of the wood actually cracked when the screws were tightened. I love most Melissa and Doug products (and this one looks so cute!), but I definitely would not recommend this one to anyone else."
4,Mom and Dad of 3 girls under 3!,"Christmas eve, and we just finished assembling this.My husband and I are veteran Ikea-furniture pros, so we thought that we couldn't possibly have the same problems everyone else had.From start to finish (we timed it!) 3 hours, nonstop, with both of us working.Mishaps: 1 broken piece, 1 hole we needed to drill through, and 1 machine screw that came loose. Also a few chips in the finish, that bug me, but the kids won't notice.But, besides that, it looks fabulous. Can't wait to see their faces in the morning."
5,Perfect two year old birthday gift,"Purchased the Melissa and Doug deluxe kitchen for my two year old baby girl. Chose it based on great reviews and neutral color scheme. Took my husband around two hours to put together (with Grace's help). Agree with others that assemby was easy based on the number system and color coding scheme. Believe the best advice was to have it laid out in order prior to beginning assembly. Was well packaged in two heavy boxes and did not arrive damaged for us. Lots of storage space to hide the multitudes of Melissa & Doug food and accessories Grace received as birthday gifts, with plenty of room to spare."
1,So disappointed,Bought this for my 2yo for Christmas. My husband opened the box to put it together and it was missing LOTS of parts and hardware. Needless to say we sent it back and she got lots of kitchen accessories but no kitchen. Will be purchasing another kitchen from somewhere else.
1,"Very, Very, Very Unhappy!","We ordered this as a Christmas gift and received only one of the two boxes, which rendered the gift incomplete. Options on Amazon only included returning the entire order and reordering it. We could not request that Box One be sent to us. We found this to be very inconvenient over the holiday."
4,Melissa and Doug Kitchen,"I bought this kitchen for my 3 and a half year old daughter for christmas. It's great value for money from Amazon. Personally for me, it was more gratifying to buy her a wooden kitchen in the same price as a good plastic one.It was a task to assemble it. It took my husband 2 hours to set it up. But he got our daughter involved as she read the numbers that came at each point in assembly. I think she really enjoyed helping him set it up. She plays with it everyday.The only trouble I see is that it's quite hard to latch the doors of the refrigerator, it takes some effort for me to shut them, and once shut, my daughter has to pull hard to open them."
2,Not made in the USA,"We had been looking to stay away from Chinese made toys, and ordered thiskitchen specifically because of the following sentence in the amazon product description:""Concerned parents will also appreciate that this toy is made in the USA with nontoxic materials.""The box arrived with ""Made in China"" written on big letters on the side. I never opened the box so I cant review that, but for those people who are looking to get a US-made non-toxic toy and are concered about Chinese toy recalls, beware."
1,NOT Worth the money or time,"Sorry to report this review about a Melissa and Doug product. This kitchen set is not ""wood"" and sturdy like you expect from Melissa and Doug. I must have spent 6-7 hours researching kitchen sets for my daughter. My husband had to use gorilla glue, scothch tape and power tools and a drummel to make this thing work. Assembly took 5-6 hours and much patience. To top it all off, we didn't receive the two shelves for the bottom oven andsink unit. What a waste of money! Please take our advice and don't purchase this kitchen. Sure do wish we could return this kitchen for one that is worth the price. This is not our style to complain so take that into consideration. I have one more thought, wouldn't it be nice if Melissa and Doug made it right with their customers? Money for them is no object I'm sure! D.K Brighton,Michigan"
1,Terrible Manufacturing,"I am in the process of trying to return this item. This item was missing directions. They were not included in the box. The manufacturer sent me the diretions but when we began putting it together, we found all the doors hung crooked. Further, the sink does not fit between the two supports it is supposed to screw into. The sink is either manufactured to wide or the supports were screwed to the underside of the counter incorrectly. I was very disapointed because I like the other items I purchased from this manufacturer. But they were smaller, less complicated items and I think they overeached on this one. Very upset and I am really hoping either the seller or amazon comes through on processig a full refund for this. BEWARE! I wish I could give it negative stars"
5,Love it!,"I bought this for my 2 year old daughter. She's very tall, so height was a big consideration. Other kitchens seemed very short. Also, this one doesnt contain particleboard or stickers to peel and eat.. this set is all wood and painted on - impressive quality. Putting this thing together took a few hours, but wasnt complicated. We used it as storage for toys instead of a toy box.. it looks good, is durable, and we are very pleased. I'm looking forward to buying the same kitchen for my niece on her birthday :)"
3,Good kitchen,"Unlike what some of the other reviews said before we bought it, this kitchen was fairly easy to put together. We didn't have a problem with any of the pre-drilled holes. There was one bag of screws that were the wrong type (should have been wood screws but were not), but we used some from my husband's tool box instead and it was fine. One piece of advice -make sure there are 2 boxes when the kitchen is delivered. The first time we only received one box and ended up having to purchase a new one at a slightly higher price. My 2-year old son likes this kitchen, but unfortunately his enthusiasm to play with it seemed to wane after having it for a few days, which is disappointing. He still loves playing with his friends' kitchens, but that could just be because it's something new. Overall very sturdy construction and he can open and close all the doors himself. Looks just like the picture."
1,Melissa & Doug Deluxe Kitchen,"I have had this kitchen for about 3 years now. I am not at all happy with the way it has held up. I wanted a kitchen that would last through all my kids and onto my grandkids. If I were to purchase again, I would buy a full wooden (heirloom quality) kitchen through Nova Natural Toys. Additionally, the paint has chipped off the corners. The knobs are constantly falling off the stove. The Door hinges bend down and are ready to break anyday. I have a friend who has this kitchen and her doors broke right off. Not at all happy with this product. I'm selling this on craigslist asap, before one of the doors DOES fall off..."
4,takes time to put together,"This product was heavy 100 lbs, we helped the UPS rep bring it up to our house, the item took 5 hrs to assemble and the kicker, it's missing part# 7 and it's my daughters birthday today, we contacted Doug&Melissa and they stated it would take some time to redeliver the missing part. Amazon handled my complaint very well, just frustrated with Doug and Melissa, p.s there are no kitchen accessories!"" .....this review was written in Jan and it is the mid of Feb and still no answers back from Doug & Melissa!"
4,Wireless Crash Course,"This book provides a great overview of wireless technology. It perfect for the person that needs to understand wireless technology, but does require a deep technical understanding. Not for the engineer who designs/manages a wireless system, better for the person that has to have a baseline knowledge of this technology to conduct thier buisness."
4,Good read,"I found this technical book surprisingly easy to read, yet packed with detailed information organized logically. I'd recommend it to anyone new to wireless, or aspiring to work in wireless. I would like to see an update to include many recent and emerging developments in wireless."
4,Heavy Tubes but they Work,"These are the thickest tubes I have ever seen, but they do what they say- they are thorn and puncture resistant. If you are looking for something lightweight, then pass these by, but if you don't care about weight and just want a tube that won't puncture from a tiny bit of debris, then these are the ones to get. I even ran over some glass with them once and cut the sidewall of my tire, but not the actual tube, so I would recommend these if you don't care about weight and just care that your tube stays intact."
3,"Not too bad, not that good","I purchased after hearing ""enganaita"" in Pandora. I was not expecting the greatest compilation, and I was not deceived, but it didn't blow up my mind either. The kind of music is typical from the south of Spain rather from Barcelona area. And the themes are kinda lame, but great for background music.If you need some music while doing something else requiring being focused, it's perfect."
3,The stuff that doesn't come with,"Well...This guitar is pretty cool. BUT.... It doesn't come with a pic, instructions, or anything, which really stinks if you get it for Christmas. I honestly know nothing about guitars, so this is good for beginners like myself. Hope this helps. Thanks!PS I'm actually 14 but it wouldn't let me go any older."
3,miget guitr,i am a real guitar player and i think this thing is great for in the car going on vacation or watever i dont think it is worth the price tho i kno were u can get a real guitr for that price
3,of what i'v heard,"this guitar sucks don't be mad that's just what i'v heard in these reveiws. but of what i'v heard i would not waste money on this i would more likely get another one i'v seen it's item number is #638760 and it's really nice and has good reveiws and read thisFrom Toysrus.com & Amazon.comFrom the ManufacturerThe deluxe electronic guitar is 31"" in length. It has 1 pick guard, output jack for external amplifier, 2 additional strings, 1 vintage-style single coil pickup, amplifier with 5 watt output and strap. Volume control, tone control, on/off switch, input jack, headphone jack, DC jack, 10 feet cable, carrying strap and carrying caseand it's the same price as this one, i don't know if it's just me but i would not buy this for a kid.. and i am a kid so i know what kids like and i really want this other one for christmas, so that might be just me but i don't know"
1,this is a bad guitar,I think this guitar is horrible. I mean it looks so bad also the make looks like its 100 yearss old!
1,BETTER OFF BUYING A STRATOCASTER,"... I OWN A STRATOCASTER THAT MAKES THIS LOOK LIKE A JOKE!WELL, MY STRAT MAKES EVERYTHING LOOK LIKE A JOKE. THE BEST QUAILITY IS THAT IT MAKES THE PERFECT GUITAR TO SMASH!......"
5,COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL,This is so cool.The best part is that you do not need a Amp because it comes with it.Kids can learn how to play music.It does make alot of noise (it depends how high the volume is)it is worth it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,ok,the toy is just a little bit to small for kids 10 and older.if your looking into getting a guitar look for a diffrent one besides this one
1,A real guitar players reveiw,This guitar is simply a beginers guitar! Great for kids from 3-9 start your kid here but by all means get thema better one if he seems interested.
1,Unplayable.,"The guitar can't be tuned. Why make a guitar if you can't actually play a song on it? This is especially annoying because returning it is going to break my five-year-old's little heart. Very, very unsatisfied with First Act :("
3,"It has its moments, but tires after a while","The first time I heard this album, I was absolutely enthralled. As time went on, however, I found that is was only mildly entertaining. As is the problem with most ""fusion"" recordings, there's actually very little fusion going on. Its more like two people imitating each other on instruments that don't typically belong together. I've heard many of V.M. Bhatt's solo recordings and many of Simon Shaheen's solo recordings and they are all superior to this release. This disc proves to be nice background music and it is a fun bit of ""ear candy"" to chew on occasionally, but there's not much serious interaction occurring. The more one gets familiar with the individual traditions (of the Middle Eastern maqam and the Hindustani raga) the more one realizes how elementary this experiment really is. Like I said its fun to listen to occasionally, but doesn't have a ton of substance."
3,Not sure if it really works,"I bought a tube two weeks ago and have been applying it religiously twice daily since then. So far, I THINK I see a minor improvement in the darkness under my eyes but my wife says she doesn't see any improvement. ""Stick with it,"" she says.I do see a definite improvement in the puffiness, however. The ""bags"" are virtually gone. I can see and ""feel"" the difference.I know already I will not be buying another tube whether it works or not. At $95 (plus tax or shipping), it's not really the cure-all it claims to be. If I don't see good results by the 28th day, the remainder of the tube will be returned for a refund under the manufacturer's 30-day satisfaction guarantee.UPDATE: I returned this item to the store for a full refund. This stuff doesn't deliver what it promises and at $95 per tiny tube, it should do better. If I could, I would reduce my rating from 3 stars to just 1."
2,Not Impressed,"I have to agree with Mr. Racoon Eye's review. I applied the product religiously twice a day as instructed. I do not have a problem with bags only dark circles. After 30 days with no improvement, I returned it. I'll stick with Elizabeth Arden's Eye Wish. Much better product at a much cheaper price."
1,This is fraud.,Why are companies allowed to lie to people this way? I used an entire tube of this product and my dark circles are EXACTLY the same. DO NOT buy this product. These are con artists.
1,"I fell for it, too","And I was fooled. When I read about it in a magazine, I thought Finally, something the sounds like it will really get rid of the dark circles under my eyes. I've had them since high school and they just seem to get worse as I get older. I'm into my third week of applying the cream religiously with no visible change. I'll try to return the rest of the tube to Macy's for a refund (wish me luck)."
1,I HAVE BEEN RIPPED OFF!!!,I bought hylexin from 101BeautyStore. Before purchasing it I emailed him and asked the expiration date and if the item was original. I received an email back claiming that the item is fresh and genuine. Everything has gone normal until the use of 1/3 of the cream. After 1/3 has been used another 1/3 was full of liquid inside. The expiration date was good but the originality of the item is a big question mark???? By the way the good effect of the eye cream is far away then the ones I used before. The item is not original and genuine. DON'T BUY FROM HIM!!!!
1,Won't try again,"Some improvement, but not worth that kind of money. I'll stick with ROC Eye Treatment."
5,It worked well,"My husband and I both found this product to be effective in reducing the dark color of circles under our eyes. We used it faithfully for weeks and weeks, and finally saw a definite improvement. I still have to use concealer under my eyes, but I don't have to use very much, and now it does completely cover the dark circles."
1,I bought two and used them and it did not help at all,"Hylexin Serious Dark Circles by Bremenn Research Labs - 0.78 ozI thought since it was expensive that it worth trying, I feel sorry for spending my last dollars on this productI paid 95$ for the first one and used it all, and got no results at all, I was so deceived that I even bought one for a friend and she did not get any results at all.Then I thought may be I have to get another one so I get longer treatment, I wasted my 95$ again.I did not see any results my dark circles stayed the same."
1,Not good product,I used it for a month and nothing changed my dark circles. I had to call up the representative and tell him that it was waste of $95.
1,You helped me-maybe I can help you,"I know this isn't a tip-sharing site but I feel like you all saved me money by reading your reviews so I thought I would share a product that worked for me. MD Skincare's Lift and Lighten Eye Cream has worked better than anything I have tried. It didn't rid me completely of dark circles but I was sometimes able to go without cover-up and I've never been able to do that since I started wearing make up. It's also a little expensive but you can return it if it doesn't work. I would say you should see results in about two weeks otherwise, it may not work for you. Good luck."
1,"I'm embarassed to say that I fell for the hype, too.","After 8 weeks of consistent use, I see no change. My dark circles are a family trait, and I emailed the company before purchase to ask if it worked for inherited dark circles. The respondent assured me it worked for ANY dark circles."
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"After reading their website, I had expectations for this product. Folks, this thing does not work!"
1,not worth it,it didnt do anything for me. its not cheap and i wouldnt mind if it was effectivebut its not
4,hylexin serious dark circle cream,Works for me best product I have found for dark circles always looking for something better have not found yet
4,Visible improvement but not a miracle cure,"I have been using Hylexin twice a day for several years. I used to look like a walking corpse. People used to ask me if I'd actually been hit. With Hylexin, there is a noticable improvement. I lost that ""dead"" look. It is not a miracle cure for dark circles. I still have plenty left. But I do see a noticable improvement. I've tried Eyevive (no results), Deravera (no results), Belli eye Brightening Cream (no results), Hydrolyze (made the dark circles worse) and Roots Herbal (which made my eyes INCREDIBLY WORSE). Hylexin is the only product that made any improvement. It also eliminates all under eye puffiness."
3,"Not Bad, but No Miracle Cure","I agree with the other reviews. I do notice a difference, but as with any cosmetic application, short of surgery, it is a subtle change.To all the other sufferers out there like me with dark circles, this products helps but you will still be able to see them, they are just not as dark, about one shade (or perhaps two if you are lucky) lighter. So the question is, is that worth $95 to you? Personally, I think a good cover up stick is better. Try Clarins ""Instant Light"" instead. It works and is easy to apply. Guys, it is also not so ""girlish"" and looks like a pencil. You know you secretly use your wife's, girl friends, or whatever anyway. It has it's own all-in-one brush and twists up to pump more product into the bristles. It blends in nicely too."
1,Give me a break!,"Terrific! Another overpriced, supposedly miraculous little product from the folks who brought us the other overpriced, supposedly miraculous little product known as Stri-Vectin.Give me a break!Save your dough, folks!"
1,Waste of $95,Hylexin did not work for me. I still have dark circles under my eyes and now I am $95 poorer. Maybe my dark circles weren't SERIOUS enough...
1,What a scam!!!,"i've been using this product for over a week and have seen NO IMPROVEMENT. That's acceptable if it cost $5.00 - but at $95.00 a tube this is ridiculous. Don't be fooled like I was, now I have dark circles AND out a hundred bucks!"
1,Hyp-lexin,"I feel there has been too much ""hype"" over this product. I've used the $95 worth and have had no results. I'm disappointed; but I'm happy there are reviewers who like the product."
1,Expensive snake oil.,"I really wanted this to work. I have serious dark circles under my eyes and have tried everything else. But I've been using this twice a day for two months and I haven't noticed any improvement at all. Not even a little. In fact, my eyes might actually look worse. It has not faded the dark circles, nor has it improved the bags."
1,Would Give Hylexin No Stars if It Was A Option,"Hylexin was a waste of my hard earned money. I have been using a product called Ocuderm and getting great results. I wish I had heard about it sooner. My dermatologist told me about Ocuderm. I love it, the results have been great. Stay clear of Hylexin it is a rip off."
1,Not effective,I've been using Hylexin for three months (twice a day) to treat my genetic dark circles. So far there are no visible results. I am very disappointed with this product. It is very expensive and I would not buy it again.
1,Saw no improvement after 6 months,I used this product twice a day for six months and saw no improvement. As far as I'm concerned I wasted $95.00.
1,"A waste, don't believe the hype!","What a waste of money this was! Please do not believe a word - does not get rid of dark circles, does not get rid of puffiness. Does absolutely nothing!"
4,good short lived project,"Tiny Buddy features Michael Ward (vocals, guitars) (ex-School of fish and The Wallflowers), Bob Thomson (bass) (ex-Big Drill Car and Xtra Large), and drummers Miles Gillett and Michael Urbano (ex-Cracker, John Hiatt, Smash Mouth, etc.)The songs on this album are great. I bought this album on another website over 10 years ago. Let's just say that I still own it and listen to every now and then."
1,small pocket folder knife,Cool knife design but the blade metal is too fragile. Tip broke easily. Don't pry (at all) with this knife.
4,Works well,Product fits and works as advertised too bad my vacuum cleaner went out a day after i installed it. Not the products fault.
3,I have two different Eureka Vacuums,I have two older model Eureka Vacuums that take the same Hepa Filter. I thought the online (Amazon) price of these filters was great compared to purchasing in a store. The Hepa filter fit tight in my TRUE CLEAN Vacuum and no so tight in the ALTIMA Vacuum. Could be just the manufacting of this brand of filter. I am going to order through another vendor and see. I gave 3 stars for this reason but I would order these filters again because they work great in my Eureka TRUE CLEAN Vacuum.
3,I wish it wasn't made in China,"It is a factory Eureka part. I like that, and the fact that it is made with Arm & Hammer baking soda. I do not like that it is made in China. In the future if I will look for a replacement that is made elsewhere."
2,Incorrect item sent.,Was sent a Eureka HF-5 instead of HF-7. Amazon recommended to just return and not reorder because the wrong part would most likely be sent again. Have to find another vendor.
5,total in your face lesbian witchcraft metal,"due to too much censorship in the uk(united kingdom) and the banishment of their very name in some parts of europe these ladies had to change their name to something along the lines of ""mm-tv"" some of the censorship thrusted upon this unique band may have come from WASP frontman steven ""blackie"" lawless(i know his real name because i own a copy of ian christy book sound of the beast and he is not the only one brought-out by christy). motor driven bimbo 2000 is a mix of hard rock/punk and traditional metalthese ladies music not only opened my mind broader but also gave to me a deeper appreciation of the feminine form.i am also very much against california's prop 8 messure banning gay marriage. i do firmly believe people have the right to live their own lives without being descriminated. i am very liberal and a libertarian."
4,I really liked the CD.,"WOW 99 was a very good, and inspirational CD. I love a lot of the songs on there, including the ones I knew already and some that I had never heard before. Bye for now and stay blessed."
4,Easier version of CSE,"It's interesting to hear the evolution of Cato Salsa Experience: ""No.3"" is almost totally different from their lo-fi garage debut ""A good tip for a good time"". The album is well produced and the happy-go-lucky lo-fi atmosphere is basically gone for good. Still, the music sounds relaxed rock'n roll and is somewhat enjoyable and entertaining. It brings in mind the good old days back in 1970's when music wasn't too complex, but still well played with real instruments :) The band knows what they are doing and they are doing it well. So take of your shirt and hop into that convertible: the summer is here, let the good times roll!"
2,Good story but wow! The typos!,"The story was well conceived and well written, but it was terribly disconcerting to find typos and missing words on nearly every page. Did anyone edit the text before printing?"
4,A good piece of work regarding the music and the lyrics.,The new members have brought a new flavor to Jaguares and Saul has yet to stop using creative metaphors throughout the lyrics of these songs. If you have tried to create music you will know what new directions the band and it's leader are takiing.
2,An honest review from a Caifanes/Jaguares fan,"Well, what can I say.... I'm kind of disappointed. Although I couldn't live without any one of the CAIFANES albums, and I'm probably one of their biggest gringa fans, I'm not impressed by this latest JAGUARES album (or the last). The studio side is wishy washy, lacking a creative fire I usually associate with Hernandez's songs. On the other hand, I really enjoy the live album. It reminds me of how much fun their concerts are. Also, the bassist and drummer seem to have a lot of fun jamming together during live performance. I say, if you are a die-hard fan, buy the album. If not, try the CAIFANES albums ""El Silencio"" or the more mainstream ""El Nervio del Volcan."" They rock!!!"
1,REPETITIVO Y ABURRIDO,"LO PREDECIBLE,UNA MUESTRA MAS DE COMO MUSICOS Y COMPANIAS DISQUERAS USUALMENTE SE REBAJAN PARA HACER DINERO FACIL. UN FRACASO DEFINITIVAMANTE NO LO RECOMIENDO."
1,This Cd totally blows!!!,Poor live execution and terribly uninspired new songs. A huge dissapointment from what seemed would have been a good band.
1,A piece of crap!,In a few words- Dont waste your money on this weak and uninspired piece of crap!!! If you do you'll seriosly regret it.
5,Jaguares son Chingones,"This album not only gives the public an idea of what the band sounds live, but gives you a completely different concept via new material. The new material is exceptional, more profound. In the past, Jaguares and Caifanes tended to have music with a grungy, crude feel, never going as far as to include orchestraic sounds. I think it takes rocanrol to a new level. I compare it to when Guns N Roses recorded November Rain. It was then when you knew the band had finally matured. The Jaguares are again trendsetters."
2,It's Not What We Call Rock In The USA,"I heard a great mexican station on the radio here in the NW. Had to track down that music. Killer stuff with guitar better than Beck/Page Yardbirds. Searched for the ""best"" Mexican bands. Bought all Caifanes and Jaguares stuff hoping that would be part of what I'd heard. Internet info said these must be the ones - they were the premier rock band in Mexico...maybe the world. Big disappointment. Caifanes/Jaguares are not actually ""rock"" as we would call it in the USA. They are a ""soft rock-pop"" band. No power...no energy...monotone vocals by the supposedly great Sol Hernandez. It does nothing for me and rates as one of the biggest traps I've ever fallen into in my search for real music. Buy at your own risk. Dull."
2,HERE I AM AGAIN,"Man, I just don't get it. There's a lot of great reviews here, but it's not happening for me. I don't speak (or listen to} spanish. Maybe that's the difference. Maybe it's the lyrics. At this very moment I'm listening to this album again and trying to understand why it gets good reviews. Frankly it escapes me, being an english only speaking person. I'm willing to admit it if I'm wrong...but for me...after repeated trys, where I really wanted this to be good (I bought 2 Jaguares and 5 Caifanes CDs) it just doesn't move me. Never...not on a single song...not once. There's nothing happening here musically. Enanitos Verdes are a much better bet. Killer musicianship and vocal expression all the time. I guess I found the best first. You have been warned. Avoid the hype of this band. Enanitos Verdes blow these guys away with any one song you want to pick. The comparison is stunningly dramatic.F"
5,Bajo El Azul De Tu Misterio,"Jaguares ... this there second album after there name band change from Caifanes to Jaguares. Keeping his same style of play ,Saul Hernandez nce again proofs why his and is one of the best bands in Mexico. On this double album the first cd , is live with some old hits from when they were caifanes , on there second album are new songs that are really good like , Hoy and , there smashing hit, Fin ... well this is a an album that you have to have if your a Caifanes/Jaguares fan ."
3,esta curado pero no para darle las 5 estrellas,"Saul Hernandes ya no es lo que era con Caifanes. Si dos tres canciones estan curadas del CD Bajo El Azul De Tu Misterio pero no les llegan ni cerca a las canciones de los Caifas. Una cosa si les digo, si tienen la oportunidad de ir a un concierto de esta banda les garantiso que van a querer este CD."
3,Looked Better on Paper,"This CD would appear to have a lot going for it. Imrat Khan is famous for his extreme-virtuoso surbahar technique; here he plays unaccompanied, surbahar only (no sitar, which he has never mastered to the same degree, and no tabla accompaniment from his son), in what appears to be an audiophile recording. But when you actually put it on, it manages to disappoint on point after point. Imrat's playing feels quite unimaginative, and the sound of the surbahar becomes thin and metallic, lacking the warm body that it has in real life and in most other recordings. Fans of Imrat will of course need this disc anyway, for it is not wholly without merit, but for the newcomer some disc in the Maestro's Choice or India Archive Music series will serve as a much better introduction to the sonic world of Imrat's surbahar."
4,Keeping it for reference,"This is a textbook - it isn't light reading. Having said that, it is very well written and informative - covers past scholarship, present scholarship and emerging thought on the critical level and also links in historicity and where applicable, Christian theology as it pertains to Christianization of Old Testament texts. Will keep this in my library for reference. One frustration was that I did not have adequate time to read it side by side with the Old Testament book under discussion. That would be the best use of this book - read the text, study the scripture it refers to, and read the text again. Keep a dictionary beside you unless you are a mad scrabble player :) Lots of unfamiliar words, and my vocabulary is not shabby. Learned a great deal from the read and considered it worth the effort."
1,Dreadful,"This is an atrocious book -- ill-informed, insulting, drenched in bias and hatred, smug, desperately in need of proof-reading, unbalanced, and only marginally improved from the differently-titled volume that (without acknowledgement) preceded it. It is frightfully depressing that many readers (including some represented in these comments here) evidently believe that this book embodies solid research, and that they apparently trust it as a guide to understanding the religious faith of their neighbors."
2,Good for source material and that's about it,"You may get your money's worth if you use this one critically. It contains plenty of original quotes from ormon sources that speak for themselves, and that's the ONLY reason this book gets two stars. But there is little in the way of depth of research beyond primary LDS material. And then there is something that would make a smaller book completely unusable: The veneer of sensationalism. Perhaps LDS ceremonies are derived from occult practices, perhaps not; but if they are, Ankerberg and Weldon could have come up with much more rational ways to say so. Two evangelical scholars, Mosser and Owen, years ago decried the inadequacies of counter-Mormon apologetics and rightly castigated these authors for producing too much of a diatribe and not enough of substance in their work; I would not recommend this book at all were it not for the wealth of original source material it references. I use it while holding my nose."
1,Doesn't deserve any stars.,"This book is not definitive and is not well researched. It laces together decades old myths, and does nothing to try to substantiate, one way or another, the reality behind what they are saying. These guys make money writing this stuff! It relies on testimony of those already discredited, gossip, and other less than reliable sources. Want to read a good review of this book? Check out: Peterson Daniel C., ed. FARMS Review of Books. 9 vols. Provo, Utah: Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (FARMS), 1989-1997. Granted, the review is by an author who is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but I think you'll find the review based on facts. You'll also find it a bit entertaining."
1,Two of our most brilliant minds toiling in anonymity...,"Do it! I dare you. Click on the name of this books authors and see how many they've written. Isn't it absolutely amazing? These two men in their short lives (any life would be too short) have amassed an immense amount of knowledge on: UFO's, the Occult, Catholicism, Hinduism, Mormonism, Jehovah's Witnesses, New Ageism, Holistic Medicine, the Trinity, Evolution, Charles Darwin, Angels, Homosexuality, Halloween (I don't wanna know), blah, blah, blah...And me, in my puny pathetic life laboring diligently in the vineyard to understand one small part of one branch of engineering. Where's a Nobel Prize when you need it? Do the nation's governors know about these guys? Why, they could replace an entire university faculty!"
4,"Good review of Mormonism, raises many important concerns.","This book brings many deceptions and Mormon doctrine into the light. Think for yourself, read the book. ""The church and the kingdom of God has no fear of the truth."" E.T.Benson"
5,great,This book is the best source I've found for camping and outdoor recreation. The maps are extremely detailed. I highly recommend it!
3,The scale is too large,"The scale of the current Washington DeLorme atlas is too large and the maps in it are unsuitable for detailed recreation planning (in my case mountain biking). The scale is 1:160,000. There simply isn't enough fine detail. DeLorme needs to lower the scale by a factor of two or three.These comments refer to the ninth edition (2008). DeLorme revises these maps periodically so if you're reading this review years later check to see if they've fixed the problem before deciding not to buy it."
2,Washington Atlas,This is handy to have but lacks the detail that it could 7 should have. Back roads are usually unmarked when there is room to put it in. We have found ourselves lost many times when trying to take one of them. There are too many intersecting roads that are not listed and those that are are not labeled.
5,A must have for the frequent road tripper,"This is a great tool for those who travel the nation's interstates. We like to travel, towing a 5th wheel camping trailer. Using the Next Exit is a snap to find a grocery store, restaurant, fuel stop, relaxing park or even a chiropractor. This is a comprehensive guide listing everything off an interstate exit. Nothing is worse than guessing. It's a waste of time and gas pulling off the wrong exit. We've all done that far too often, creating unwanted stress. The Next Exit will pay for itself quickly and make your trip more enjoyable. This book is an asset for any traveler.Ken Fritz author of The United States Radio Directory: A Traveler's Favorite Companion 2008-2009"
2,Not what I expected,I was under the impression this was an all natural water-based lubricant with no glycerin as stated on an external site other than Amazon. Sadly I was mistaken. There is glycerin and other not so vaginal friendly ingredients.
4,feeling good.,"I've found that slipper kitty though a great product leaves a sticky/tacky feeling like most personal lubricants. I guess washing up afterward is a small price to pay for the fun that it affords you, both strawberry and natural taste fine for those who like oral pleasures, so go ahead and enjoy yourself."
5,Great CD,"This band is on their way to stardom! if you like blink 182, eve 6 or anything in the pop-rock genre than you'll love ebo...give them a chance and you will be impressed. some of my favorite tracks include rain song, machine, and secret. they have catchy rocky and edgy songs. secret weapon will impress...you can say you listened to them before they became big!"
1,Dull hard edged pop rock,"Despite their harder edged sound, ebo is essentially a pop rock band, a genre that depends of great songwriting. Unfortunately, ""Secret Weapon"" has precious little of it. In fact, after the openeing track, there is little on this CD worth hearing."
5,Consumers as active participants,"The author, an anthropologist, explores the phenomenon of second-hand clothes being exported from the West into Zambia, where they are sold on as ""luxury goods"". She argues against the idea that this is a North-South neo-colonial or aid transaction, asserting that Zambians are not just passive recipients of recycled clothes, but active consumers making informed (or at least broadly understood) cultural choices. She also explores how clothes, as cultural signifiers, give the wearer meaning in the specific Zambian social context. She also identifies reasons why people choose salaula and its impact on culture and ""modernization"" in Zambia Hansen explains the whole commodity chain of procurement, distribution and consumption of second-hand clothes. The reader may be surprised to learn that clothes given away to charities may be sold to exporters for resale in developing countries at all."
4,attention grabber,this was a great suit....the only thing i had to do was apply heat to the head piece with my space heater to round out the head because it was oblong from being packed so long. otherwise the costume was great.
2,Poorly made and packaged,"This product contains 3 items: tie, jacket & shirt-bib thing. I have no complaints about the shirt. The jacket was really poorly made. I don't expect a costume to fit perfectly but it would be nice if some attention to detail was made. The tie is really neat but the packaging ruins some of the effect. It is folded once so the tie is bent. There are a couple of internal wires but even messing with those got few results. The tie is a great product that is damaged by the way they choose to package & ship it."
4,Nice Outfit.,It's a nice outfit. its a little big on me but its still really cool! I really enjoy wearing this!
3,a little misleading,"I was upset upon receipt of this item because nowhere in the description does it say it is for an ADULT MALE. I had assumed that since it had come from Toys R Us that it would be for a child. It fits up to a size 46 in mens. I have a 4 1/2 year old daughter that is very disappointed. Also, purchasing the 7"" Jack Mask, it is a ceramic wall mask not a costume mask. That was not in the description either. The items a both nice items if that is what you are looking for."
2,"My first Woods, but also my last","To be honest, I'm surprised by all the 4- and 5-star ratings. Despite the stray twist here and there, this book was extremely predictable. The dialogue did not ring true, and I also had the sense of the author pulling the characters around by the nose in order to facilitate his plot. This was especially noticable in the actions of Dino and the other cops -- occasionally they would do something that seemed to come out of left field. Later, a plot point would develop and I would say, ""Ah, that's why the author had them doing that."" The last thing you want is to see the author pulling the strings, so to speak, behind a work of fiction."
3,"A Light, But Lively Read or ""Nothing Dead Here""","NEW YORK DEAD is pure entertainment. Quick and fun. Stuart Woods has created an enviable character in Stone Barrington. He always gets the girl...in fact he gets all the girls. Stone is smart, handsome, debonair and he spends alot of time in bed. Even the tragic events in Barrington's life like losing his job or a romance ending are so not tragic that little sympathy is evoked. With a wry sense of humor and very little effort, Stone goes about solving mysteries. Novelist Woods deftly maintains the suspense throughout the story and rewards the reader with surprises at the end. This is a book (and a series) that will appeal to men and women, so long as they are not in the market for gripping, gut-wrenching intensity. - Robert John Estko, the author of the suspense thriller, EVIL, BE GONE (available on amazon.com)"
3,Implausible but interesting,"I recently started to read all the Stuart Woods Stone Barrington books. These books were designed to be read in order. Many of the story lines and characters overlap. While some comments are given in later books about earlier plot lines, it is better to read them in order. These books are pretty light and a quick read. I liked the characters Stone Barrington, Dino, etc more than the story itself. This book sets the table for future books and story lines. Its a quick read."
5,Really enjoyed the audio book,I really enjoyed the audio book. I have been a fan of the Stone Barrington series for a long time. Will be looking for more.
4,"All you could want, but there's just one thing...","great read that moves along quickly and doesn't linger to distraction on the romantic involvements of the main character (the downfall of so many detective yarns). however, i am still confused about one thing: on page 213 of the paper edition, stone is asked by his new law partner to undertake a video-taping on behalf of a male client who wants a divorce from his philandering wife...""if he gets his little video...,"" implying the client is male. he then gets the video (page 234) and his law partner is so thrilled he calls his client immediately to relay the good news, but the call begins ""hello, charlotte?"" implying that a woman is the client. i read this several times and it still reads as if an editor blinked along the way. thinking this was deliberate, i assumed going forward that this somehow played into the plot. it doesn't, but there it is."
3,Kind of Bored,"I started reading this series with a lot of excitement. I thought that I had found a new series which to sink my teeth into. I have found Mr. Woods' writing to be boring and a bit self serving. I find it bothersome when an author writes almost like it is himself in the book. With the attitude of being better than most. For the same reason I don't like Linda Fairstein or James Patterson. The premise of the books is pretty good but all through reading I just wanted to shout out loud ""you are not the cop in the book!"". I hate reading a story where I think the author perceives him/herself as the star. I enjoy reading so I would tell you to try it. My personal dislikes may not bother you. I even tried one of the Orchid series and had a hard time with that one as well."
4,New York Dead,"The beginning of the Stone Barrington series. A lot of foundation work, but a good read."
4,Great Author,"I love all of Stuart Woods books and I picked them up by accident. I just love Stone Barrington and wish he were a real person, just so I could meet him. I loved New York Dead and he had me stumped on how the ending would come out. I just love Stuart Woods and hope he comes out with some new books with Stone really soon."
4,SUSPENSFUL AND UNPREDICTABLE,"This book, by Stuart Woods, grabs your attention from page one and never lets go untill you've completed the book. I've never been a person who has just loved to read, but I have found a new hobby now that I discovered what an excellent author that Woods is. Not only do you feel like you know the characters very well, but Woods also makes you feel the pressure points and exitement of the story."
5,very fast page turner,"i'm becomming a bigger and bigger fan of Stuart Wood's books..this is the second stone barrington novel I've read..he keeps things jumping at a pretty quick pace but I never felt lost while reading this book. Plenty of colorful characters abound as well, most of which are flawed..some more than others. But I find that more interesting than the formulaic black and white of good vs. bad.Stone has crises of conscience in this book. Torn between what's right and what could make his life better. This goes both with his personal life as well as his work.The book reminds me a little of James Patterson's earlier work, before he became too formulaic.Definetly a great read and I look forward to reading the rest in the series!"
3,Decent but predictable,I will read more of his books but I hope Stone smartens up some. Stone was a little slow in figuring something's out.
3,NEW YORK DEAD,"I MUST ADMIT I WAS DISSAPOINTED WITH THIS STUART WOOD BOOK.,. I EXPECTED MUCH BETTER.I DECIDED TO READ HIS BOOKS IN ORDER OF PUBLICATION DATE. I HOPE IT GETS MORE INTERESTINGWHEN I READ BOOK NUMBER 3."
4,stone's start,"Having read later books, I wondered how stone began his law career since the later books only gave brief references to his beginning. I found this book to be quite interesting and entertaining."
1,Big Disappointment,"I was really hoping to like Stone Barrington, but it didn't happen. The writing was only so-so. Bed-hopping is the best thing that the character does and that's not saying much!"
4,Good cheap dog bowl,The item is exactly as pictured though it's a bit more flimsy than I had hoped. Pushing gently on the bottom surface will cause the metal to make a popping sound as it bends. However it's more than adequate for a food or water bowl. The stickers came off without tearing or leaving any sticky residue.
5,Beautiful and Graceful Album,"This album was fabulous, loved it, it was extremely rare to find an album that every track is stellar, you won't be disappointed! This album is has become one of my favorites!"
4,Better be good at math...,"I was hoping for a dumbed down introduction, but this book went into great detail with all the math that goes along with it...I am sure it would have gotten all five stars in my review if I had understood complex mathematics..."
1,Not what I thought it would be,This rug's color was the only thing that I liked about it. It was a super cheap looking and feeling rug once I got it home. It was thin and seemed like something that should be in a kid's play room or at a day care. Very stiff and not soft at all.
5,Indian Interiors,Excellent value for the money. Beautiful photos covering a broad range of interiors.
4,"A good read, but...","I liked this book, but then anything that advocates a progressive return to space has alwasy attracted me. It was a good read but some of it just seemed a little to preposterous. If you enjoy return to space type book give this one a try."
5,Flowmaster 17208 Cat-back Sys for 5.2L 1998 Durango,"I purchased the Flowmaster 17208 Cat-back System for my 5.2L 1998 Dodge Durango after spending some time on the Flowmaster muffler web site. I have ordered books from Amazon.com for several years but never an automotive part; so I was a bit reluctant to order, especially something this big. The complete, assembled Cat-Back system arrived in good shape, due to the large sturdy box it was shipped in. The item fit properly and installed without any glitches. I like the low rumble sound, just right for SUV (If a pickup truck, a little louder would be good for me). I am very satisfied with this product and would order something like this again when needed."
3,Hockey card picture is misleading,"I was expecting 1 Victory 2000 2001 pack of hockey cards and you gave me:11. Also Donruss Priority 1997 and 1998, Pro Set 1991 and 1992 series 2, and Pinncle Hockey cards 1995 and 1996 were not included in the picture and you sent them to me. I am very disappointed with what I got."
1,Hockey Cards,This item is not worth the value. Some packs of cards are not even endorsed by the NHL!
5,Jimmy - The Greatest,"One of,if not the best, of the best. Ilike him better than Sinatra. Even the background music comes on strong with artists who bring out Jimmy at his best. The songs take me back to better days of life. For me, nostalgia. A bit of fresh air,a vocalist who projects sound from where it is supposed to come from, unlike many of today's singers(?) who seem to sing through their noses.I find it easy listening,these songs tell stories and are clearly understood. Sing forever Jimmy."
3,Expect to receive 12 of them,"To be fair, there is not much of a description of the product but I was expecting one larger sized, high-quality cookie cutter and instead received one dozen medium sized, okay-quality cookie cutters. I have no idea what I am going to do with one dozen maple leaf cookie cutters, but I figure it is cheaper just to keep them rather than pay for the return postage."
4,creative fall cookie cutter,"I made cookies with this cutter this fall for Thanksgiving and they came out great, with the exception of a few broken stems. Use two different fall color icings for a creative look."
5,"Fun, versatile handbag and great design","This handbag is made from a lightweight, shiny leather. It is smooth to the touch and has worn well for the two years I have owned it. The rolled leather handles fit well over the shoulder and are comfortable. While I own it in the pretty yellow, I think the white would have been even better as it is a more versatile color.The lining is a sturdy cotton paisley print, complete with an interior zipper and handy credit card slots. It is deep enough to hold magazines and folders, yet wide enough at the bottom to still hold a thick wallet without being too conspicuous.I like the wide zip top that zip from either direction. The tassel detail adds an extra touch of detail. Its a great bag for a great price and I would recommend it."
2,Looks cheap,"I usually like Latico bags, but this one was not a winner. It's advertised as shiny leather, but it's not. It's patent leather, which can look really cheap and plastic in certain colors. I purchased the blue and it looks like a bag I'd get from a teeny-bopper store. Gotta send it back, which is a shame because I really love the style."
4,A Good Story With Some Spiritual Lessons,"I watched this movie primarily because Brad Stine (the superb comedian) is in it. I am glad that I did.Although Stine is not one of the lead characters, the show is well done and has a good message. Debbie Laramie (Crystal Bernard) is a female pastor who is fired from her job due to her unorthodox methods. She and her son, Hayden (Bobby Edner), move to a small town, Paradise, where she takes over a small congregation.Some of the people in the church don't seem to get the essence of the Christian faith (loving God and loving people). Debbie focuses on that and makes a real impact.There is a lot of good drama regarding a destructive fire, the church pulling together, and lots more. This is a thought provoking show that is well worth watching. It is not a high budget production with lots of special effects, etc. It does however contain lots of other good elements. It is well worth watching."
4,Welcome to Paradise,It seems to be more difficult all the time finding movies without a lot of violence and language. With this movie you don't have to worry about your children viewing it. This movie is good to share with fellow believers. I found this to be uplifting.
5,Welcome To Paradise,"This is a uplifting movie, we showed it at a singles movie night, we sponser at a church. Everyone loved it and a couple of people wanted their own copy. We try to find movies with meaning and without the terrible language that is in most movies now. We would like to find more movies like this one."
5,"So Beautiful, So Human, So Inspirational","What a beautiful tribute to the human spirit when it guided and inspired by God...There are so many people in America who are like the citizens of Paradise...Going through their daily lives unaware of their potential greatness until a crisis..good decent folks who main stream Hollywood ignores as they concentrate on the criminals, the deviates and the cruel..No one can watch this film with being a better person for the experience..."
3,Small problems,"Clock had been packed with loose styrofoam material and some of it had gotten under the glass and I had to take it apart to remove the packing and clean inside of glass of fingerprints. I should have just returned it but it was a Birthday present so I just fixed it. Other than that, the clock was just what I wanted and delivery was prompt."
5,A Guide to Prayer for Ministers and Other Servants,This book is very good it has been such a blessing and uplifting. I would recommend it to anyone who just needs a daily uplifting
2,Yay/not,"This strobe is AWESOME while it works. It is extremely bright the and great to have as a DJ. I have come into ownership of three of the lights brandnew. One I bought off amazon, the other two were given. After just 3 dances, only one light works now.The problems.Light #1 doesn't do ANYTHING. Not a single flash... (and YES, I did try changing the bulbs out)Light #2 strobes at random, and does not work in manual mode. However, it does work when plugged into a strobe controller.Light #3 still works.I have always liked chauvet gear, but after this experience I WOULD NOT buy this product again. I would go with a more expensive alternative that is built to last more than three gigs."
2,Marginally functional at Best,"I ordered it for my daughter's 12th birthday party, because she really wanted dancing. It was a last minute order, because I had been planning to rent one until I saw what the rental rates were.It worked out of the box perfectly, once. A little weaker than I had hoped, but that was not wholly unexpected, since the script suggested multiple lights.I did, however, expect it to work more than 5 minutes. That's how long we had it going on the test run the day before the party. The next day at the party, the steady strobe failed completely. We could only get it to work with the sound activated function, and that only worked with the speakers literally pressed against the sides of the light. That meant that it couldn't be suspended, we had to sit it on the table, so it was in everybody's eyes.I'm pretty disappointed."
4,Great Strobe,This strobe is HUGE!!! It responds well to the music but there is a delay so it's not very easy to notice. I'm happy with it simply because the sound response mode makes the flashing look random. I would've given it 5 stars had it not been for the delay.
4,"Big light case, bright strobe","OCt 22, 2011 Received the light quickly. Although the specifications list it as a 6 inch light the outside plastic lens cover is much larger. Its big and bright. The specifications list 15 flashes per second but the actual light is labled with 10 flashes per second. It does not flash very fast but it seems good enough. I've ordered a backup light bulb just in case."
5,ready for halloween,cheaped out last year and only bought two of these for our halloween lightning display and used two small ones for the center channel. added the third this year. this is a fairly powerful strobe which we shine about 25 to 30 feet onto our house. does a nice job.
5,Great strobe for the money!,"Like others have stated on here before, the strobe does react to sound but you have to have it close to a speaker that is pumping out a lot of bass as the light only reacts to the lows. Definitely lights up a lot of space. Well worth the money!"
2,Worked for about 10 minutes,"I was excited to get this strobe light based on reviews. But when I received it, I read the instructions, and plugged it in. It worked right away, strobes fine, but a little off beat. Not constant strobes, then it stopped working completely just after about 10 minutes in. The fuse is fine. I don't know why it already doesn't work, but I am going to contact the seller and see what happens from there. I plugged it into a grounded outlet, it was set to the right power option. It would be a good strobe light if it worked."
3,Big But OK,"This unit is big, but I read it was already. It is also very bright! It does very well. I had it on the fastest setting for a few minutes and started to smell a bit of smoke. I simply slowed it down and seems to be OK. I wish the power cable it came with was longer. It is only about a foot or foot and a half long. I also wished it had a stand option without having to mount it.because it is so bright I aim it at the ceiling and the light bounces back down and covers very well."
1,C-bo Autopsy,I was realy looking foward to getting C-Bo Autopsy. Unfortunately I never got it. I recieved an email from the sender saying that it was returned to them by ups because the box was open & the cd was missing
3,VERY slow. Most excercises done in a chair!,Way too slow for the active seniors in my bldg! Instruction given at a snails pace! Even if all you do is walk - this DVD is too slow for you.
5,"Clear, easy instructions for beginners","As seniors trying to stay flexible, my husband and I found this Tai Chi DVD an excellent choice. It is well worth the price."
4,Balancing and relaxing,This CD is a very complete but easy to follow version of Tai Chi. The visuals are great. The first time using it I found it was energizing and also relaxing after a few minutes of use. Amazing how one can forget to relax.
3,Just okay,"It's okay, it must be an intro cd because the whole cd is shown on the cover. It only gives a few different moves. A little dissappointed."
2,They should change the title of the CD for Warm-up exercises for Tai Chi,This is only warm up for the Tai Chi and it should be said in the title. It was only endeless explanation about the postures and warm up exercises.
1,Way outdated,"This book may have had some value when it was written, but most of the content is obsolete by now.Moreover, it spends a good portion of the text describing how to install the products and most of the rest is dedicated to the description of the options (essentially a cut-and-paste) from the manuals.A waste of time (money and paper)."
4,Be careful,This product works great once you realize that it works at a fixed voltage which is not mentioned in the accompanying product literature. Thank goodness for the Amazon reviews because a previous user listed the 1.9 Voltage required to make it work with certain motherboards. After making the BIOS adjustment the product works very well.
1,Needs too much power,"This won't work with 1.8v main boards and this information isn't listed on Amazon's site. I returned it, and as always, the Amazon return process is very easy."
5,Works great,"I installed 2GB in my ASUS P5K-E with INTEL CORE DUO 2.6 running VISTA ULTIMATE 64 BIT and I think it's fantastic, ordered 2 more GB. Way to go OCZ."
2,Worked But Didn't,"Installed ram and it worked fine except wouldn't post on a fresh start up. Tryed it on two different computersand behaved the same , But in general you can't go wrong with Ocz Ram......"
5,GREAT VALUE!!!!,"WOW!!! I am truly amazed of the value of this memory!!!! IM JUST AMAZED!!!I mean, 70 greens, wow! Im using it right now, let me tell you this is great stuff, let me set up the pros and cons, and compatibility issues,pros:great value, fast, rieliable, heatspreaders do workcompatibility issues: From the reviews (and my setup) it looks like it works the best or works with AMD proccecors, so make sure, or if you have intel, really, try these babys out, it'll be worth your time.cons: ? dont know, i mean there has to be at least some, BUT, only had these for a couple weeks or so, i'll update this later, for now, BUY THIS, you wont regret it!!!"
1,Unnecessary!,"One review discribes this book precisely: ""I lost my manual. This book replaced it perfectly""!There's almost no information that's not already in the manual. Not even basic information I hoped to find in this book e.g. ""Will the camera set the custom functions to default when changing the batteries?"" No, it only ""in portrait mode the depth of the field will be shallow."" Even in the EOS manual there are sample pictures in order to illustrate this function.For similar prices you'll find much better books on understanding photography (e.g. John Shaws nature photography field guide""). In combination with your manual even the biggest photgraphy rookie will learn more from this combination.Of course, if you lost your manual, this book deserves five stars for it's a substitute to your manual - not more!"
4,I keep this book in the toilet.,"There is so much good stuff to learn about my Elan 7E, that I kept this book next to the toilet for the first 4 months. I then put it in my camera bag, and have further accelerated my understanding of this very technical, and very fun camera.In fact, just last weekend, I found the depth of field preview button.So many buttons.I would have liked to have seen better explanation of certain photography technical terms in the book. Depth of Field, Focal Length, F-Stop. I suppose the authors thought that anyone paying so much money for a camera would have understood these things. I now do, after I bought the Alesse book.This book, however, does a very good job explaining how this camera worked. I would recommend it."
1,I was not impressed,"I found the book annoying for example the so-called hero had these episodes where he could only be calmed by sucking at the heroine's breasts,most of the situations were demeaning to both sexes ,there was very little genuine tenderness or feeling. If it was meant to be Science Fiction it was a flop, witness the scene where the woman gives birth to an egg that contained their children, as for erotica, it left me feeling kind of queasy - in one village the women were not only forced to go around naked they also had to wear collars and leashes ,in another section they had to sit with their legs wide open exposing themselves, I guess it caters more to the bondage crowd,but to me the prose itself seemed rather unimaginative and juvenile.I guess this really does come down to personal preferences"
1,A disapointing book in a good series,"Giselle McKenzie decided that she was virgin long enough. But the guy she is going to bed is a complete slob and I can't see a female of any species taking to him. Rem Q'an Tal is having problems due to his lack of a sacred mate-he is starting to devolve mentally and physically and he saves Giselle from the slob. There is some well written erotica in this book with good characters, but there are some plot elements that are plain silly. Now this is fantasy so realism should not be expected; but the idea of oral se4x as a form of payment is silly enough to disturb the willful suspension of disbelief. Overall I find the book a little below average for the genre. The attack by a devolved mental case is OK but not as well written as I would expect from this author and his disposal (he decides Giselle is the goddess because of her freckles and commits suicide) is weak overall."
1,No Mercy,"When I bought this book I thought it was a combination of a sci-fi action thriller with romance and maybe some sexy scenes. But this is a porn book and it lacks of substance, everything is around sex. If there is a threat, the author resolves it in the next page and the sex action continues. I don't recommend it. I like stories, in which the sex scenes are justified by the sequence of events in the novel."
2,wrong cover,I bought this used book for the cover -not the contents.(my friend is the cover model) When the book arrivedit was not the edition I had ordered. I am very displeased.
4,"No big message or deep meaning, the album reflects its title","Charlie Daniels, before he became a Country Music legend, was known as a Southern Rock artist, along the lines of many of the artists he covers on this album. So the credibility is there from the start. Aside from that, the album is just meant to be a party album...nothing more, nothing less. This isn't meant to slight the idea at all. If anything, it's refreshing to see someone cut loose at a time when too many Country artists take themselves too seriously. As a student of Southern Rock, I tried not to compare CDB's versions of ""Homesick"", ""Pride & Joy"", and ""Free Bird"" to the originals, though many will. But that's not what it's about. It's just a jam...so have fun, turn it up, and sing along...'cause the South's Doin' It Again!"
2,a lot of these didn't sprout,I won't buy seeds from this company again. Several of the seeds didn't sprout. It was quite disappointing. Another company I bought seeds from showed me what it should be like -- definitely not this company. I gave it two stars because the packaging is nice and the potential is a good thing. I like the thought of this mix. It just didn't work for me.
1,"Columbia Sportswear Men's City Trek Beanie, Coal, Platinum,",I purchased the hat for myself and had expected a better quality of product then what I recieved. The material was snagged and it did not fit snugly on my head as advertised. I contacted the supplier and they said they were sorry and I could return the hat although they did not have any other hats to send me. They did not even offer a substitute product. I expected more from the supplier.
4,Good product,I put this on a glock 26 9mm and the clip stays on well and allows me to adjust for carry height on my beltline. This is a good option for folks that place a high level of importance on concealment.
5,great item,this item is great. kit comes with extra components. easy assembly and no damage to gun. have used it nearly every day since purchase. the clip remains secure to gun.
5,Best thing ever for Mallet finger,"This splint is amazing. I suffered from mallet finger and after 8 weeks of trying every kind of splint available...finding the paper clip and adhesive free tender tape worked the best...I finally stumbled upon the oval 8 splint. It is THE BEST. Holds the finger completely secure and straight without having the annoying tape on the skin. You can wash your hands and dry them and really you don't even realize you have a splint on for the most part. I was very disappointed in how weak and ""saggy"" my finger was after 8 weeks of splinting. I am hoping another few weeks with this splint will help. If it doesn't I will probably just wear the oval 8 splint for the rest of my life. It seriously is that good, it woudn't even bother me to make it a permanent part of my hand!"
1,Crappy and almost destroyed my tank!!!,"After a few months of use the item became completely rusted and corroded and it left an absolute mess all over the inside and outside of the top of the toilet (i almost had to replace the tank)...i am shocked its not stainless/rustproof...(I left my original review below)Yes its flimsy and looks a bit cheap but it is so functional and inexpensive...this thing is so functional and for the price you can't go wrong...we put this in our downstairs gust bathroom which used to have an expensive metal mag holder that sat on the floor next to the toilet and which I always hated because the magazines never stayed upright, it cost too much, and I hate stuff on the bathroom floor...this thing holds about 4-6 mags and two rolls of tp...I am sure it won't last very long and will rust eventually but at that point I will just get a new one...one request is that they offer one in powder coated white which would blend better and obviously look a bit nicer as well"
4,Bathroon Storage Caddy,"I like it, and am givinig it four stars instead of Five, in that the magazine stoarage area could be a little wide. So far fits two magazines and book."
4,good,"So far it does it work... Love seeing my magazines hanging in there, I read it gets rosty after a while so I put plastic on the ends that go inside the tank and so far no rust"
3,Fiori's weakest album,"The nauseating title (""Take me"") apart, this is the weakest album from Patrick Fiori. It does not reflect his potential and his creativity. All songs sound the same. There is too much heavy synthetic noise in the background. You can hardly hear his voice. The melodies are not captivating at all. In fact, there is not much going on in terms of melodies. It's all one-dimensional generic pop. I know that Patrick is capable of so much more."
5,Ideas GALORE!,"In addition to beautiful photography, there are clear step-by-step directions for making many different kinds of books. The directions are easy to follow, with large illustrations of exact steps.There is enough variety included to interest an experienced craftsperson, but presented in such a way that a beginner is not overwhelmed."
1,high price for a low-quality appliances,"Bought the sharp electric range a couple of years ago and have already had problems with burners and switches. Sharp customer service does not give too much service and support to customers at all. Its local contractor is A&E, which is notorious for delays and bad quality-service. Don't buy this product."
1,One of the best albums from people with no talent,"This album is trash -- and I love it. The sexual ambiguity, gaudy Liberace-esque costumes, the downright awful vocals -- what is there not to like?My favorite songs are the ones in which Alexander does not sing -- his voice absolutely sucks. Not even the wonders of the music studio can save him. La Camilla and Jean Pierre, however, gotta love em'."
5,One of the best childrens books ever written!,"Stella Gipson Polk is the sister of Fred Gipson who wrote Old Yeller and her book Glory Girl is every bit as good as Old Yeller. It is set in the Hill Country of Texas and shows the authors deep love and respect for the land, its people and their ways. The book centers around an orphan named Eve and an elderly lady who reluctantly agrees to care for Eve for a while. She teaches Eve about how she lives and in the process teaches Eve about the lore and ways of the Hill Country. In turn Eve teachs her a lesson about love. It's a beautiful story that every child and adult should read. It with stays with you long after you turn the last page."
1,DOA and Refurbished,"This product arrived DOA. Tech support says based on teh serial number, it is NOT new but refurbished. They are replacing the batteries hoping that will fix it. They are suggesting it was sittin on a shelf too long. 1 week to get batteris shipped to me."
5,louiegenzano,Another great CD from the great Jimmy Roselli. As I stated previously on saloon songs three; this other 'kid from Hoboken NJ' had one of the best voices of all time. The Cd arrived quickly and in perfect condition.
5,MOST ENLIGHTING READING,"As a beginning Buddhist I have done a great deal of reading on the subject. This book is fantastic. Each chapter is written by a different author, making it a collection of short essays. It is perfect for the lay Buddhist or anyone interested in Buddhism or just expanding his or her horizons. I have recommended this book to many friends and they have all enjoyed it."
4,"fun, but expensive and stiff","Cute pictures and mother-of-toiletseat white plastic, they are a fun novelty but I'm do not find them comfortable to actually use for playing."
4,The Evolution of Three Generations,"My mother grew up in Hazelton, a town near where the action in this book takes place so I had to read this story. It's really a story of the American immigrant experience. Foreigners struggle to fit in to a mixing pot of a country with strange laws and customs. They make a better life for their children by working hard in dangerous conditions like in this family's case in the mines. At great expense, the subsequent generation's possibilities are expanded.But are they happy? Or is the life their parents lived with a purpose the one that is the happy one. And are the parents happy that they created children that in their adaptation and success are strangers."
4,Good.,"I enjoyed ""Baker Towers"" although it was a mild disappointment after reading Haigh's better ""Mrs. Kimble."" This one is an Italian-American family saga set in small town Pennsylvania. A newly widowed matriarch, Rose, and her five children journey from WW 2 to the Vietnam era. It's the kind of book that begins with a funeral and ends with a wedding... not exactly original, and some of the dialogue (""Whatsa the matter, bella?"") is laughable. But between these cliches there is some rich character development and wisdom about the lives of the characters. Some of Rose's children make life altering blunders (like marrying the wrong person) while others find happiness in surprising places. By the end I was touched.""Baker Towers"" is far from perfect, but I enjoyed it. It is also an easy read -- I finished it in five hours."
4,A Good Old-Fashioned Family Saga,"A friend loaned me this book because of my interest in the history of coal mining in Pennsylvania. The author impressed me with her deftness in creating characters and keeping them consistent yet interesting as they evolve over time. I thought Dorothy's mental breakdown (or whatever it was) occurred too abruptly, and I'm not sure whether the bleeding episode brought it on in any way. Another reviewer has commented on some of the jarring anachronisms in the story. I'll point out two more:--- There was something about a kid with a ""transistor radio"" sometime in the late 1940s; as far as I know, transistors didn't come along until the mid or late '50s.--- The author used the word ""bugging"" to mean pestering; that sense of the word didn't come into the national vocabulary until the '60s.Despite these flaws, however, I found the novel compelling, convincing and authentic."
4,Book Review,I haven't read this book yet but I have read other books by this author. It was a good price and sent promptly. I am looking forward to reading it. It was shipped quickly and got it fast. No complaints.
2,I was disappointed......,"This was not the book I was expecting. I enjoyed the first half of the book, then it was downhill from there....I didn't know where the story was taking us and got frustrated and READ fast, it was not worth the price of the hardcover. Sorry I did try and like it."
4,Baker Towers,"I liked this book. It was a wonderful ""slice of life"" piece. Set in a small mining town, in the 40's, you get to know the members of one family very well. It's a realistic portrait, but doesn't have gratuitous violence or language. I would read another of Jennifer Haigh's books."
4,Like it alot!!,Very informative along with being captivating. Good characterization. People were believable. I never visited that area of the country but it sounds like it is now a very beautiful state.
4,terrific followup to a great first novel,"I absolutely loved Mrs. Kimble, so I couldn't wait to read Jennifer Haigh's new novel, Baker Towers. She didn't disappoint. While I usually have trouble following authors when they change voices and try to tell the story from multiple viewpoints, Ms. Haigh does it effortlessly. There is no doubt that she has switched to a new voice and a new character is telling his/her own story. My only problem with this novel is that it focused on the female characters and didn't elaborate so much on the male figures, but it didn't bother me so much that I would hesitate to recommend this book. My book club is reading Baker Towers and all 11 of us absolutely love it!"
2,Disappointing....,"As her other novel, ""Faith"", was fantastic I was very disappointed in this offering. I found the story boring and disjointed; it left one character as if falling off a cliff, and started another with the same result, and so on. Did not finish after reading 42%. Had to leave it for a day, and could not bring myself to go back to it."
3,Baker Towers,"I was disappointed with this book. I purchased it after reading Mrs. Kimble, by the same other. Mrs. Kimble was her second novel and a great book. I'd give that one a 5."
2,Not the 50's I Remember,"When first deciding to write my thoughts, I scan other customer reviews to see how my feelings stack up against the majority. In this case, I am definitely in the minority. While I loved Mrs. Kimble for its originality and strong characterizations, I found the characters in this book to be pretty much cookie cutter. I love books that return me to that comparatively innocent time of the 50s, but this one did not. It felt forced and incompletely researched."
2,Disappointing,"I have to agree with Jeannette C of Utah. The narrative was really well done and kept me moving along, but I was disappointed in the book overall. Depressing and never really a good climax. I kept hoping for more and it never happened. Sadly, I would not recommend this book."
2,"too much hype, too little payoff","It may be that I expected too much, but I wanted more than character studies set back in a ""nostalgic"" time. This novel did not deliver. I recommend Cynthia Ozick's Heir to the Glimmering World as a better investment of your reading time."
1,A big disappointment,"I was born in western Pennsylvania in a town much like the one Jennifer Haigh attempts to describe. She does a very poor job. I've also taken the train from Altoona to Pittsburgh and never once crossed the Susquehanna River. I had a sister who put pancake make-up in her legs in lieu of nylon stockings, but she used an eyeliner pencil to draw a simulated seam down the back. Ms. Haigh's women used Magic Markers; there were no Magic Markers at that time. Ms. Haigh makes a 1950's reference to Washington DC's Watergate Hotel which was built in the mid-1960's. These inexcusable errors (there are others, too) irritated me so much that I made it only to page 78. I doubt that I'll return to finish. This may seem petty of me, but the characters, also, are one-dimensional."
1,What a slow and boring downer,"Having received this book as a gift, I felt obligated to keep reading it, even though it never captured my interest. Every character had such unhappy things in their life, and many events, such as what happened to Dorothy during her Washington episode, were never explained. I kept waiting for something happy. Instead, it got to where I could predict the next bad thing to befall these people. The author also lost me when she described using Magic Marker to draw a fake hosiery line down the back of legs. Where would one find a Magic Marker in the 40's? I wish I had not wasted my time reading this book!"
5,phenomenal fiction,"It is not only extremely satisfying, but terribly exciting that a writer in only her second novel can deliver a story so remarkably mature in it's weave of voices and language.Baker Towers is a wonderful novel, beautifully written and told, perfectly controlled, moving and evocative. The prose is acute and incandescent, full of small fires that burn within.How the author got here, where she is, is some kind of miracle and mystery, but beyond anything except honoring."
3,"Maybe I'm too picky, BUT","The author refers to Magic Marker being used in 1944 - these were not marketed to the public till about 20 years after that. We also see characters staying at the Watergate Hotel in the 1940s. This hotel opened in 1971. When I see something like this in a book, it spoils the whole thing for me. Where are the editors, the fact checkers? A decently entertaining book,but this kind of thing is sloppy, at best! I found these two glaring errors in the first third of the book. When I read further, who knows what else I will find!"
2,Baker Towers,This was an interesting book about the coal mining years in Pa.The author did a good job with character development.
4,Inspired by the Counting Crows,"Very good Dutch band. Live on stage they are even more better, especially when they are playing their less famous tracks. A band which is inspired by e.g. the Counting Crows. If you listen to both of them, you might be able to recognise this. Defenitaly recommandable!"
5,great cd,this is a great group I have seen them live in the Netherlands they really can sing I'm dutch so I can understand the lirics
4,Great Turn on,"What can I say, but wow! The book was a total turn -on and has spiced up my sex life and made them come crawling back for more."
1,Two Times... Not a Charm,"I ordered this product that said that it was specific to my type of laptop. When I got it, it worked for approximately two days before it no longer charged the battery or provided AC power to my laptop. I sent it back and asked for an exchange. I received the second one and it did not even work as soon as I took it out of the package. I even tried both AC adapters on a different laptop to make sure that it was not just my personal laptop. No luck. I ended up sending both back and received a refund in a timely manner. I would definitely shop from this company again, but I do not think that I will buy anything electronic/for electronics again. Very timely with the exchange and refund."
5,NICE.......,This Chevy hitch is nice. Put together easily. Picture is not the item but description is. Great shipper and A+++++ Tranaction.
4,One of the better ones,"Superior cast, nice suspense, unsatisfactory climax -- The explanation of the conspiracy just doesn't compute, or it would have been 5 stars."
2,"Tedious, boring","I'm only halfway through Season 1, Episode 1 and I've already turned it off. Talk, talk, talk. I usually love BBC productions, especially MI-5, and series like Poirot and Sherlock Holmes. I had high hopes for The Hour, but I don't think I can stand to give it any more time to see if it gets better."
2,I was totally underwhelmed,"At least by episode 1. If it was free, I might give it another chance. But it's not free, is it?"
4,Much better than Mad Men,"This series has been compared to Mad Men. It is, however, in a league way above the American series which, in the end, became rebarbative - its hero never learned anything and the women were all ultimately wimps. The Hour, on the other hand, has a strong central female character and a plot that moves (after the first slow episode) at a terrific pace. Romola Garai is radiant. Dominic West exudes the same sleaziness as he had in his role in The Wire, only this time with an English accent. And anything with Anton Lesser in it has the thumbs up from me."
1,Slow moving and obnoxious characters,"Very disappointed as I had heard good things about this series. I don't know which was worse; the slow plodding and predictable story line or the lack of any characters of interest. As a matter of fact, the character Freddie Lyon is so obnoxious, I was hoping he would be killed off 30 minutes into episode 1! Little did I know he would continue on as one of the core characters."
2,This is no Mad Men,"I was expecting Mad Men and loved so many BBC shows, but this isn't it. Look for something else if you want Mad Men-like show."
4,Lotsa Plot,"This series bares all the hallmarks of good British dramas: interesting, well developed and rounded characters, complex relationships between various characters and plots that twist and turn and usually are not predicitable. The mid 50's costumes, props, settings and ambiance capture a sense of the era, as well as the real news footage and headlines of the day."
5,Obsessed,Absolutely love this show. Ben Whishaw is to die for. He does an excellent job. The story is riveting and fun to follow. Now I only wish Amazon would add episodes of the second season quicker!
4,The Hour Season 1,I am a big fan of BBC America. I also am a fan of the old tv shows of the 50s. So when I heard about the Hour I missed it and decided to watch season 2 and purchase season 1.I really like it because of the early days of local tv just like we had in the USA. Ive only seen 2 episodes of season 1 but am looking forward to the whole programs.
4,British Drama,Dominic West is the actor that played McNulty in The Wire. It was interesting to see him with his normal British accent.
4,"Nice, but wondering if it will hold up over time","I bought this travel bag for a Parks PRS-15 Bike Stand. The bag meets my expectations given how inexpensive it was. My only concern is how long it will hold up to the weight and hardware rubbing. There seems to be plenty of room, but the Bike stand is pretty heavy and I'm concerned the weight will be too much for the bag. Although, up to this point it seems to handle it quite well. I've only moved or carried the bag a couple of times...so we'll see how it fairs in a year or two. But for now, it's a perfect acccessory for storing the stand and tools."
5,wonderful photos,"After seeing these photos, I'm further inspired to visit all the national parks!The essays were unnecessary and took space away from additional photos."
4,Awesome pictures,I was looking for a nice book with illustrations on National Parks and this is just the book. The pictures are amazing and well worth it.
5,A great product!,"This is something I consider a staple and I try to keep it on hand ~ we use it in salads, tuna and a wide variety of recipes ~ I hate being out of this product.It arrived in good time and in perfect condition and was a good buy."
2,Italian Dressing Mix,"Good Seasons Salad Dressing & Recipe Mix, Fat Free Italian, 1.05-Ounce Packets (Pack of 24)I tried this pack as I normally use Good Seasons Italian Salad Dressing Mix (non fat free). It just does not have the same good flavor. I will go back to the Non Fat Free."
5,Good Seasons Fat Free Salad Dressing,"Highly recommend this product for those people looking to enjoy their salad and at the same time reduce their caloric intake.Guests at our home have commented on the consistency and hardy flavor of this dressing and then are amazed to find out that it only has 10 calories per two tbsp's, no fat and no oil added.We were having difficulty finding this product at our local supermarkets so I went online and purchased through Amazon.com.Good buy!"
2,Recieved wrong item,"I was disappointed with the product I recieved because it was not the same as what is shown in the picture and was not the product I wanted. Though it was the batherapy brand, I was looking for the one that helped with aches and pains as shown in the photo. The one I recieved wasnt' it."
4,Salty and raunchy fun,The Archer series is hilarious and fun! Adam Reed has done a masterful job of putting his gags and humor into a fast-paced comedy.
3,"Great show, but....","I love this show! It has been a favorite of mine since it started. My only concern is the ""previously unaired pilot."" This episode is just the original pilot, except archer is replaced by a dinosaur. No, I'm not joking, nor is this fake. I bought this series just to see the episode i never saw before and was extremely pissed when i watched. I am still a big fan of the series, but do not buy this season to see anything you haven't already seen on TV or Netflix."
2,Not really my cup of tea,"I heard this show was pretty fun, parodying Bond and the spy genre of the sixties. So, I picked it up when it was on sale. I was a bit disappointed. I won't really get into the aspects that I liked, such as the art, which had a pleasantly retro feel, or the voice work, which was well matched for the characters and well acted across the board, but will instead summarize the key points I disliked.My chief complaint was that the show's humor was crass and had no real subtlety, a true irony for a spy parody. The jokes were rarely creative, instead relying on blatant offensiveness or sexuality. Whether this was an artistic choice or lazy writing, it failed to amuse me more than once or twice.A few additional complaints: the soap opera drama that goes on in the office; the lack of any character with redeeming traits; and the unimportance of the show's setting to the majority of the show's jokes."
3,"Great Series, Crappy Product","I can't get enough of the Archer series. However, the only ""benefit"" made from jumping up from DVD to Bluray was to have all the shows on one disc. The extras were exactly the same - no more, no less."
2,"Don't do it - great show, bad DRM",Archer is the best new show to come along in ages. Great show!!!!But don't buy it here -- the DRM restrictions are unbelievable. It is extremely difficult to watch this on any computer other than the one it was downloaded on -- and you have to use Amazon's proprietary player or Windows Media Player 11.Also can't burn this to DVD and play on TV.Everyone should wait for a better format to be released.
3,Good but could be better,"The show has an amaazing cast, a creator that has made some of my favorite shows but this is a hit and miss show so far as of season 1.The pilot episode and a few others like episode 3 are wonderful episodes that have me laughing out loud consistently but then there are a few that are just kind of boring and it doesn't feel like i'm watching a comedy.Hopefully with season 2 it gets a little more daring and finds it voice."
5,Hilarious,"This show is awesome, but only if you like shows that are hilarious. As other reviewers have mentioned, don't buy this for the bonus features. Buy this show because it is hilarious and because you will want to watch it many times."
4,Very Funny,"The DVD took a while to come in the mail but thats what you get with free super saver shipping right? Brand new, unopened and undamaged. The show itself is very funny and I had a blast watching all the episodes. There wasnt many episodes for the 1st season but they were all good. The extras are ok but there could of been more. All in all im happy with this DVD. Cant wait for season 2 =]>"
3,Kinda disappointed,"I absolutely LOVE this show. Best thing on television. That being said, I am sorely disappointed in the effort put into the Blu-Ray/DVD. I purchased the DVD originally, only to find the ""unaired pilot"" was a ruse (to use an Archer term). Still, because of my love for the show, I upgraded to Blu-Ray when it became available, way too many months later. The Blu-Ray is EXACTLY the same as the DVD, just on one disk instead of two. I had an outside hope that there might be some more bonus material, but moreover, I just wanted to see the episodes uncensored like an adult. Unfortunately, in either format the show is still censored just as it was for the original broadcast on FX, and there is no new bonus material. Adam Reed's genius seems to double with each new project. I can't wait for new episodes, but the disk release needs a ton of work. He should ditch the producers of the season 1 DVD and give those of us who so truly love his work a better effort."
4,Archer DVD,Bought as a gift - the recipient was very excited to see it under the tree- happy viewing in the future
5,Naughty Fun,"Archer is a naughty boy. A secret agent who isn't so secret, a ladies man who can't commit, a momma's boy who hates his mother...so much fun"
5,Stop reading this and just buy it,Archer is by far the funniest show I've ever seen on TV. If you're still reading this than you've already wasted more time than you should. 1-click buy this and start watching it right away!
5,Hilarious,The DVDs came in perfect condition and this show is absolutely hilarious. I would definitely recommend it if you have a sense of humor!
1,won't work on helmets with a snap,"I think the idea would be great, but I'll never know. They will not go on my helmet unless I cut the strap, which I do not want to do. Sure wish it had mentioned this in the info about the product!"
1,Broke after 2 months,The clip fit well and worked as advertised.I was happy with this product for about four weeks. Then it started hanging up a little bit. Had to wiggle it to release. Then one of the locking prongs broke off.
5,Love it,This is a must have product if you have a helmet. I am shocked that helmet manufacturers don't use something like this in their helmet designs. Maybe it's a DOT or SNELL approval thing I don't know but this tiny clip makes putting on and taking off helmets as easy as starting your bike. The main reason I bought this is to be able to fasten or unfasten the straps with gloves on which is normally very difficult to do. This clip makes it very easy to do just that. 100% recommended.
1,this broke after only 9 months,"This clip works great..for awhile..then as all things cheap plastic do..it breaks...and I am talking about the button part that holds it together..as soon as it break your chin strap is dangling...so seriously...do you really want your motorcycle helmet thats protecting your head, held on by a cheap piece of plastic that has a clip prone to break off on its own after less than a year of using it regularly. I dont and will never buy this clip again."
5,works great!,"I have small half helmet and this clip works great. It's a breeze to install in it holds my helmet in place. Been up to speeds of 75 mph and the helmet didn't budge even when I turned my head. Easy to use with gloves. Some people complained that it felt cheap, well it's plastic and look at the price what do you expect? Still great product."
3,It's Just Okay,"It's the same as other clips I've bought. I won't be using the clip. It may be easy to use but it will also shorten the strap. In addition, these clips tend to press up against my chin. I thought this was going to be different than others."
5,Perfect product!,"I've used speed clips previously, but the PowerMadd PM81060 surpasses everything else. The few extra dollars that it cost is well worth it. Very easy release, and problem free installation.....no cutting or sewing required. I will purchase additonal PowerMadd clips for my other helmet's. Absolutely the best clip available!"
3,Not for new HJC helmets,"Bought 4 of these for my family. Once I received my order, which was very fast, I tried to attach them to our helmets. Our HJC helmets have a small snap on the strap opposite the ""D-rings"" that keeps the loose strap from flopping in the wind. These snaps won't allow me to feed the strap thru the ""A-clip"". I love the idea... not very fond of cutting my chin strap. In conclusion: if your helmet doesn't have any ""snaps"" that could interfere with threading it through the small clip.. I would suggest this item to everyone who owns a helmet."
5,The best clip for the money,"I have tried several of these ""speed clips"" and these are by far the best out there. They are very rugged and built to last. The truly great things is, they stay adjusted to where your helmet is most comfortable. I bought a couple for my two helmets and will not try anything else. In fact I bought a couple of spares as back-ups and the originals show no signs of wear or breaking down. I have since past on the backups to friends and they swear by them as well. Do yourself a favor. Buy these once and you'll never look back."
2,Need to mention helmets with snaps- NOT ALL HELMETS WORK,"I have an EXO1000 that has a snap on the male end of the straps. The snap does not fit through this product's fittings. I do not want to cut off the snap end to install this. This item is cheap and I question the quality or comfort if installed, or even whether it is safe if involved in a crash."
5,Great,Fast shipping and great price. I bought those for my dad and he loves them. He said could not find any better deal than here.
5,Fine for my needs,I purchased this for my survival bag. You can fish with it and you can use it for basic cordage. Win Win
4,OK for Everyday fishing.,"This is a good line for everyday fishing, but I'm not sure I'd want to use it in a tournament. It seems to me that it is a little stronger than its rated 15 pound test. I tested it by tying it to a 15 lb. dumbbell and using it to lift the dumbbell. While the line was holding the weight of the dumbbell, I added two 4 oz. sinkers to the load, bringing the weight to 15.5 lbs. and the line didn't break."
1,Wordy hogwash,An inane pill to swallow. The book says little in its 341 pages. I'll never get that time back.
5,They Should Really Market This In The U.S.,"It always seems that the U.S. is 6 mos. to 1 year behind when it comes to bringing artists from other countries. Well, it is a shame the Killing Heidi has not been released in the U.S. yet. The instrumentation of ""Weir"" is a blend of alternative and folk music that gives me goosebumps. I think it would appeal to a wide audience in the U.S. and I don't know why record companies are so adamant about exposing their artists. Take a look at Michael Learns to Rock for example."
5,There's nothing like great aussie talent!!!,"The first time I listened to the song ""weir"" I was totally blown away by the variation and the power behind Ella's voice. IT IS AMAZING!! And the band is fantastic...it's a must hear!!"
4,Worth it for extra trax,"By itself ""Weir"" is a great song, although overplay tends to kill it (like any decent track). The other releases of KH are again good, but to me seem a little too similar to really get into. So I thought Killing Heidi were only semi-decent until I heard ""Astral Boy"", which to me more than anything proves their maturity and depth as a band. It's one thing to be able to do a particular style of song well (""Weir"", ""Superman/ Supergirl"" etc), but to master different styles is what genuine, lasting talent is all about. ""Weir"" and ""Astral Boy"" are completely different styles of song, and I'm totally impressed by KH's ability. ""Astral Boy"" especially is a beautiful ballad piece: the music is haunting in its sheer simplicity, and matched only by the charm of Ella's vocals. Love the band, love the songs."
3,My Two Cents worth.,"I liked the earthy quality of the vocals and guitar, however the CD cover is a bi*** - it won't fit into the damn stacker! VEry cool."
3,It's ok,"I like the song Weir, but I totally hate Astral Boy. It is boring. The single probably would have been better if there had been more tracks included."
3,Some technical gripes...,"The first 2 episodes have poor picture quality while the latter 2 episodes are better. Why ? Having experienced the fansub version of the series I was expecting very good picture quality so this was a bit of a nasty surprise. Through noise reduction and sharpening (not forgetting color correction too!) you can get the picture quality to an acceptable levels but I thought that the idea of DVDs was to get rid of these kind of things. Oh well, if you intend to collect the entire series (like me) then you'll have to live with this but my expectations concerning picture quality were higher than what I received. Let us hope that the rest of the DVDs will show an improvement."
4,Surprisingly Interesting,There is actually something other than Sunday Morning cartoons in this series. I recommend it.
2,"Bowl is fine, but sticker packaging is crap","This Stainless Steel MIRROR PET DISH 1QT 144 is exactly what it says it is, and is fine in and of itself. However, the huge advertisement sticker that covers the entire inner bottom of the bowl is impossible to remove without spending a good hour or so scrubbing it off. I actually had to soak it in nail polish remover, then scrub it no less than 12 times to fully remove the sticky residue. What a pain!"
3,thin wall bowls,"These bowls are a good price but as the old saying goes ""You get what you pay for.""My new bowls are already denting and they don't dry unless you wipe them (some kind of residue on them from stamping them out I would guess.)My older bowls are thicker and though I've had them for over 12 years - they have no dents and dry on their own.It's like I said - if you want bowls cheap and don't care what they look like - these are fine for you.But if you want something that's going to last and doesn't look like it's been dragged behind your car, get something with a higher thickness.It's your choice."
4,Diverse mixture of pop hooks . . .don't miss out on this one,"Jill has a technique with her music to catch the ears of many. It no wonder her music has been so receptive to commercial radio stations and listeners around the country. From the current hit ""Every Now and Then"" to the unique pop sound of ""Heart of Dixie"" and ""Walk The Plant"", makes Jill's CD a must for ones CD player."
1,Terrible,"L Subramaniam hanldes all Melakarta raga in the same way, it appears. I have heard his Dharmavati and Hemavati before. Although these ragas are very similar, he has played all of them in the same way. He has a fixed set of patterns and he goes over them over and over again, which leaves you cold at the end of the aalapanai. As a software engineer, I can easily come up with a software to create L Subramanian's rendering of Lathangi -all I need to do is to change a swara or two and there I have it! I bet it is going to be no different from the actual Lathangi by L Subramanian. He, like is younger brother L Shankar, lacks imagination. He has got uncanny control over the violin, no doubt, but music is not something mechanical or repetitive. It is not logic. It must come from the heart."
2,Nice features but shouldn't a sticker stick?,"I use this size label for shipping stuff via UPS and the USPS. I thought I would spend the extra $ on Avery, they've been making shipping labels since the Puritans shipped their stuff to the New World. They have some good features - easy to peel from the backing, they cover well and the ink dries instantly - BTW these work perfectly with either laser or inkjet printers. I've had no problems with the printing aspect. It's the adhesion aspect that is a problem - these guys like to peel at the edges. No matter how much I rub and burnish them, they usually peel at least a little, sometimes a lot. They're better on coated cardboard like the USPS Priority Mail boxes, worse on regular cardboard boxes. The smoother the surface, the better they stick. That's true with most adhesives, but these labels are designed to be used on boxes, and should stick perfectly to all types, especially at this price."
5,Easy to use and do the job.,"I have used these brand of Avery labels for over 3 years and I am very satisfied - no problems with smearing, curling, jamming, or sticking. It is so easy, just print, peel, stick and ship.Although it says for Laser printers, these work just fine in my inkjet printer as well. I use generic ink cartridges and the ink does not smear.Thse are cost efficient, I reduce my printing size to 80% and print landscape so that I can fit 4 labels per page, without receipts. (When printing from paypal or click n ship, I select the option to not print a receipt.)They stick fine to bubble mailers, cardboard boxes, envelopes and poly bags. A breeze to use, cost efficient, and do the job."
3,$5.00 Price Hike?!?!,"Ok product...yes sometimes the labels have to be pressed on a little harder to stick but this was a small inconvenience considering the cost savings. That is until I just went to reorder and now I see Amazon has increased the price by $5.00 - that is a bit steep. But hey, that may still be cheaper than you could get locally so shop around. Still a decent deal...just not as much as before."
5,Avery Does it Again,"Excellent product, a bit expensive but sticks to everything and covers up whats underneath. Works great in my laser printer and I have no complaints."
3,Avery Internet Shipping Labels,"Bought this to save time on shipping. I used to print on plain paper and then cut it and tape it to the mailing envelope, now I don't have to tape but still have to cut, I use stamps.com, USPSclicknship.com and PayPal.com to print my mailing labels and the printing format it does not fit the actual size of the label sheet, therefore a cutting must be made. The question is; should I spend $20 just to save a few minutes in putting tape to my labels or go back to the always cheap but time-consuming roll of tape?Advice to future buyers: Perforated in the middle for easy cut, but only in half. When printing, the remaining margins must be cut off, it does not have rounded corners, only advantage I see against plain paper? Self adhesive."
3,Overpriced & Printer Jams,"I bought these for my ebay store, to make shipping faster. I spent x6 times the amount for this higher brand. Problem is that this paper, 50% gets jammed in my printer, so I can not do multi order shipping on paypal, and print it in one shot. They need to increase the flexibility & decrease the thickness. Then the other issue is the price, it is way too overpriced, when I can get the same thing and maybe better for 5 dollars. Only thing I like is that the paper label is good quality and sticks well. But I think I am going to either have to buy the cheaper brand or buy a Zebra label printer."
3,Macon brand is cheaper,"I love this size label, you can use it for addressing packages, you can use it to label boxes when you're moving. Avery is certainly the premier brand. But Macon is cheaper!"
2,Not the real thing!!!,"Product does not appear to be genuine Avery labels. They do not peel off properly and once used they don't stick as well. When received, the package was not sealed which led me to believe they were not an Avery product. Comparing one of these labels to the back of an Avery label clearly shows they are not the same. I had ordered 2 boxes and since I had opened one of them, I kept it, but returned the other."
5,Good labels,"The labels stick securely, and the TrueBlock definitely covers anything underneath. My only problem is it seems when they cut them into the normal letter size pieces that the alignment was off just a bit as along one edge there is a tiny strip of sticky paper. This has to be removed from each piece before running it through the printer."
1,It does not adhere to a regular cardboard box,"The label is friendly to a printer but it does not adhere well on regular cardboard boxes. I applied 16 labels on 8 cardboard boxes. After 2 hours, all 16 label curled up and started falling off from the boxes. I was scared. Fortuantely I caught the problem before UPS came to pick the boxes. I tried hard to press the label to make them stick but it did not help too much. Eventually I had to tape them down. Very frustrating!I used to use Uline labels, which are thinner but stick to boxes much better. I switch to Avery Internet labels this time to save some money. A big mistake. I do not understand why Avery did not test them on cardboard boxes."
2,Why bother?,"If it didn't have PFM printed on the cover you'd be hard pressed to recognise this once brilliant band. There is too generic a sound to this recording. The musical personalities of these obviously still capable musicians seem to be lost within the uninspiring material. It's a shame as this band once presented some of the most creative and inspired music found within prog-rock. This is pop music not deserving of the tag PFM. If Ian Anderson(Secret Language of Birds) and Yes(Keys to Ascension I&II) can still make inspired progressive music why not PFM. Give this a pass, stick with the seventies material...Simon"
4,Concept-album della PFM,"Con ""Ulisse"" la Premiata Forneria Marconi ritorna alle origini con non tanto successo come nel caso della sua opera prima il concep-album ""Storia di un minuto"". Della formazzione originale manca il violinista, flautista Mauro Pagani però che durante la tourneé italiana usci da dietro le quinte per un tornarello in ""Dove? Quando?"". Il musico lasciò il gruppo si dice per differenze ideologiche nella metà degli '80. L'introduzione di questo viaggio è recitata dall'attore Ricky Tognazzi e racconta una storia dei giorni d'oggi ispirata liberamente al mito d'Ullise. Testi colti e buene musiche che ci riportano per momento a un po' del loro tempo migliore. Da non lasciar perdere."
5,Great Bruder Garbage Truck,My grandson just loved playing with garbage trucks since he was about 2 years old. Just the noise of the garbage truck going by would wake him up. He has quite a few of them - several back and side loading types and Bruder seems to be the best made.
2,Arrived with broken garbage can handle,"I got this for my son in early November to be given to him for Christmas. When it arrived, I spot checked and it looked fine unopened in its box. But 30 days later when it was opened on Christmas Day, that is when I found the yellow garbage can had a broken handle. I think it was probably returned broken before. In any case, it was too late to do anything and I didn't want to take away the present from my son."
4,Bruder Toys Man Garbage Truck Rear Loading Green,The Garbage Truck was the favorite Christmas gift for my 2-year old grandson and his 3-year old cousin wanted to play with it the whole time also. It keeps little ones entertained for a long time. One thing that frustrated both of them was that it didn't come with a person that could go into the driver's cabin. I remember buying a Bruder Garbage Truck a few years ago for another grandson and he also was disappointed that there was no person to put in and out of the truck.
5,Two Year Old Loves It,"My nephew loves anything mechanical. He loved filling the garbage bins with bits of paper and dumping them into the back of this truck. He may be a little too young to fully understand how two crank the garbage once in the truck, but he enjoyed it fully. My only complaint might be that the thing you hook the dumpsters onto is not very user friendly. No mind for the 2-year-old, though. He simply dumped them into the truck without trying to hook them up.It is a very cute and well-made toy."
1,Item not what is pictured!,"I ordered this quickly and thought I was getting the ""reuse, reduce, recycle"" gray and green truck with bins..but this is for a red and green garbage truck. Amazon - please get your descriptions matched up correctly with the photos!"
3,Included trash cans are flimsy,"There were other higher end trash trucks, but for a 3 year old, I figured this would be just fine. He is not a rough player and the handlles have already broken off of the trash cans. They do not stay on the truck without the handles."
5,WORTH EVERY PENNY.,"BOUGHT THIS TRUCK FOR MY GRANDSON, I HAD TO CHECK IT OUT FIRST, WELL BUILT AND FUN TO PLAY WITH. WORKS LIKE THE REAL THING. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TOY."
5,Grandpa Grandma and grandson(4 1/2) play garbage together,"The truck has augers to lift the garbage into the truck. We must have spent hours playing with it together. And I wish you could see the living room rug when GS emptied the full truck load at his mom's rug. We should have discussed earlier where the ""landfill "" should be located. A delightful play time."
5,Bruder Trucks are the best,"This is our second Bruder Truck, they are so realistic. I bought my son the Crane when he was 3 and now at 6 we have this Garbage Truck, there are many more we want by Bruder. They are very large in size also, highly recommend this truck."
4,Sons love this toy,"It is big, it recycles, it stores other toys; buy this truck if your child cannot get enough of trucks, dumping things into other things, or feels a healthy protective instinct toward our trash outlays."
5,Great truck,"My three year old son LOVES garbage trucks- it is all he wanted for Christmas so I looked around and although a bit pricey I decided on this one. His eyes lit up when he opened it and he hasn't gone a day without playing with it. The only thing it is missing (to me) are some sounds but my son makes his own and doesn't seem to miss it. He really enjoys putting ""garbage"" in the garbage cans then flipping them up and cranking the handle. The truck is a good size which so far seems to be durable. The rear compartment opens easiy but not too easily which is good and he loves to hide stuff in there. Overall good buy and my little guy is thrilled with it."
2,Way more beautiful in the picture than in real life,"I was disappointed when I received this in the mail as it was way more pretty in the picture. The color of the stone is way off, I found it very dark, and the chain was very low quality."
2,"Mishmash of the obvious, outdated advice, and some good tips","Most of this book is common sense (e.g. ""Refuse to pay high prices for dirty, faulty, trashy junk that a seller is promoting as antique or collectible"" -- well, duh!). Unless you're brand-spanking-new to garage sales or secondhand shopping, you probably already know most of what's in this book. And I thought the whole section on how to organize your secondhand treasures was a bit weird -- don't tell me how to decorate my house, thank you! Also, since this book was published in 1995 (pre-eBay), the ""Selling your treasures"" section is now worthless as eBay has completely revolutionized not only the selling process but also folks' newfound realization of the worth of their junk. Some useful tips throughout (the cleaning solutions section was good), but overall, not a book worth buying."
5,Catch a Dream will catch your heart strings,"Zack Burkhart is one of the most appealing heros I've had the pleasure to meet in the pages of a book. He's rugged, sexy, and thinks outside the envelope--my kind of man.Meg Delaney is a fun heroine who doesn't take herself too seriously. She's had a lot of hurt in her life, but it doesn't make her maudlin, it instead makes her determined not to repeat old mistakes.The subplot/subromance of the mother-in-law and ranch hand was almost as fun to read about as the the romance between Meg and Zach. I loved seeing slightly older characters portrayed with fully functioning sex drives.This is a great summer read. Get yourself an iced tea, a lounge chair and a sunny back yard or beach and enjoy yourself.If this book isn't a RITA finalist for the year 2001, I'd wonder why."
3,"Not bad, for a first book.","I picked this book up at a discount outlet, and I know why. It wasn't the worst book I've ever read, but not the greatest either. It's fairly obvious this is the authors first book, however I think she'll get better with time. It's a quick and easy read that doesn't require much thought."
4,NOW Foods Tea Tree Oil,This tea tree oil was well worth the price and mixed beautifully with the sunscreen i used it in. It also had a very vibrant and crisp smell whereas some can seem quite stale.
2,Came Leaking,"I bought this with some other oils and this was the only one that came leaking. I also didn't realize how strong the smell is from Tea Tree oil so the leaking made my house smell like Tea Tree oil for days and its not my favorite scent.Other than that, the actual oil seems okay but I dont think I will buy tea tree oil from Now Foods again. Their Almond Oil was great though..."
2,Way too Smelly,"Normally I don't have a problem with Tea Tree Oil... but this stuff was beyond smelly! It was so bad, my husband could smell it 3 rooms away and all I did was open the bottle!This one has hit the trash, I'm sorry to say."
5,It is what it says it is.,"It's tea tree oil. It is your job to know it smells strong. The smell isn't bad, but it will fill a room. Studies have shown tea tree oil to be estrogenic. This can potentially cause gynocomastia (tatties) in men. May be good for women? I decided as a man not to use it. Bought some 70% glycolic acid instead. Diluted it to safe levels, and burned the bad skin away. Acid is much manlier if you must put something on your face."
4,Fantastic price,"Good customer service, too. Their packaging is terrible though, just a thin layer of bubble wrap inside a bubble-wrapped envelope. When I got it, it had leaked all over the envelope. I emailed them and told the there was 1/4 of the bottle missing and I found it- all over the package. They sent me a new one and let me keep the old bottle.Very fair price for the size of bottle it is."
2,Bottle Cap Broke Upon Unwrapping Plastic Wrap Seal,"Bottle cap shattered upon removing the plastic seal along the cap. Also box was damaged upon arrival. Oil smelled very very potent, anyone a few meters would be able to smell it off me. Now hesitant to buy fluids online."
1,Who knows?,I bought this product after reading about its supposed help with toenail fungus. That appears to be someone's pipe dream. I shoulda known.
5,100% pure essential oil,I'm not sure why people rated this low and said it wasn't pure EO. If you read the description and the bottle it says 100% Pure Essential Oil of Tea Tree. I expected none-the-less. It is in fact 100% pure tea tree oil! :) Smells great too! I put a drop in my daily moisturizer and it's tingly and keeps my skin clear. Amazon has the best value!
4,Tea tree oil at a good price,"It's exactly what I expected. I use tea tree oil all the time, mostly for disinfecting and calming skin irritation. I use it every day with my face and body lotion, and a few times a week with shampoo so I go through it pretty quickly. I don't think it smells quite as good and fresh as Thursdays Plantation but it works, at a very reasonable price. The bottle is dark glass which is a necessity. Be aware that this bottle has no dropper."
4,A good oil for skin discoloration,I bought this to treat my little acnes that pop up once in a while but it didn't make the acne go away. However it got rid of redness around my nose area. I've heard this tea tree oil minimizes pore size so I hope to do this once a week. Give this a try if you have some redness from post acne on your face.
4,Great for cleaning,"I use this in a spray bottle with some water, spray the shower down and it keeps mold and mildew away. Just spray after each shower and it is cheaper than the automatic shower cleaners and does a better job. I will have to try this from amazon as it is cheaper then my local Health food store."
5,wonderful price,"My tea tree oil arrived quickly and was 100% the real thing. This is the best price I have found. Whew, the scent of tea tree oil is strong, but it works so well for so many different things! Two or three drops with my shampoo clears up dandruff and itchy scalp. A dab on a new pimple makes it dry up faster than anything that I have used. I am very happy with this purchase..."
2,Read Detailed Description,In the lower portion of the product description it includes a warning that this product is not recommended for use on skin but only for aromatherapy. Should not be listed in health and beauty if it shouldn't be used on skin. There are a few other brands on amazon that clearly say safe to be used on skin.
2,Ok Product,I've used NOW Food products before and really liked them; however this tea tree oil seems a bit off. Other tea tree oils I have used almost burn my skin if applied directly to it. This one doesn't. It doesn't say it is diluated with other oils but I think it has to be. I use it on my face to prevent breakouts and I find it doesn't work as well as other brands I have used. Next time I will spend the extra money and get another brand.
5,Great product with many uses,"Tea Tree Oil and Lavender Oil mixed in a quart spray bottle is my best cleaning solution. Sprayed in my shower, mold will not form. In my kitchen, it sanitizes as well as is a great cleaner."
4,STRONG,"I bought this for a friend to help him combat fungus on his toenails. It seems to work, however, it has a very strong scent and can quickly fill a room. If you are sensitive to smells, this will be a challenge for you. Quality product. I would recommend it to others."
2,It's not worth getting the cheap stuff,"The first time I used tea tree oil, I got the expensive kind, to make sure I was getting the right stuff. This time I decided to save money and get the cheaper TTO--not a good idea. It smelled horrible. I know TTO doesn't smell like roses, but this was worse than most. Also, it felt different on my skin. I ended up throwing it away, only to buy the more expensive kind. Take my advice--this TTO is cheaper for a reason!"
3,100% pure?,"i use this stuff for my face. it's refreshing an a great antiseptic. i was kind of skeptic about such a large bottle for such a low price, and it just doesn't feel 100% pure. it feels a little watered down and it smells like there might be some chemical filler. i didn't really have any negative response to it, but some people are really picky about their natural oils."
5,amazing album,"i got this CD because i heard that buckethead was on it. i am also a fan of jazz and fusion, but i didn't know that this CD was so jazzy. i thought it would be ambient crap, but i got it because it was buckethead, and i had nothing to lose. all the songs on this CD are somewhat ambient, but nowhere near boring. i would catagorize this CD as ambient acid jazz-fusion.everybody's performance on this CD is simply stunning.buy this CD!"
4,free jazz nightmare,This is the last recording by Tony Williams and stands strong with his work in the 60's with Miles Davis. Ambient soundscapes lie alongside blasts of mutant free jazz. The genius that is Buckethead plays demented yet melodic guitar lines which complement the musical mayhem contained on this disc. Fans of Praxis and Surrender to the Air will not be dissapointed.
3,Bogged down in chapter 3,"Revolutionary War buffs will be aghast at my short attention span, but I just couldn't make it past chapter three. I think my problem was I picked up the book wanting to read about Frances Marion, The Swamp Fox. The writing just seemed stiff and was taking too long to get to Marion.Remember watching ""The Swamp Fox"" on Disney and the weekly confrontation with the red coats and slipping away into the swamp?This story follows Augustin Drummond and his adventures with the Swamp Fox during the war, but it didn't match my memories of the television series."
5,The Atkins Shake Mix was wonderful! It had ...,"The Atkins Shake Mix was wonderful! It had fewer carbohydrates than I thought it would, which made it fit better than I'd imagined in my low-carbohydrate diet. There were also many different things I could use the shake mix with. I made smoothies, mousse, ice cream, and milk shakes with it! It was full of vitamins and minerals, so it made the wonderful desserts even more nutritious. I loved it!"
4,The chocolate mix tasted fairly good for a ...,"The chocolate mix tasted fairly good for a diet drink. It mixed easily. I thought the large container was a better value than some other diet mixes, which come in smaller containers. The directions are easy to understand. Overall, the fact that I lost six pounds the first week is most beneficial."
1,Will not fit a 1996 Dakota,"I searched for a 1996 Dakota. This is the part that Amazon suggested. This part fits 1997-2003 Dodge Dakotas and Durangos with 3.9L V6 or 5.2L Magnum V8. Unfortunately, this type of filter system does not fit any normal 1996 Dakota setup. Beware of the Amazon parts search engine."
3,GOOD BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Ellery Queen is the master of the logical whodunit where fairplay and clues are a must. In this novel there are two major flaws. First the book should have been a short story or a novella at the most. The story is dragged and the clues are spaced after the interval of two or three chapters when they could have been given sooner. Second there are only two startling facts about the deductions in the book otherwise it's quite simple nothing complex. Not entirely bad but it could have been better. The killer is easy to guess too.Good as a short story nothing for a full length novel. Still the final explanation is well done. Not amongst his best books but worth a try.
2,Not sturdy,I think this product is too weak. The picture gives a wrong impression about the product. The pump handle is also very small. This is delicate pump. I would not recommend this product.
1,arabian gulf is a fake name,the correct name is PERSIAN GULF. UNITED NATIONS says so in resolutions ratified in 1971 and 1983. dirty arab dollars cannot change history
2,I beg to differ,"Well, despite the fact is quite minimally researched and cutely balanced, it is also wrong in the title. Whatever the newly rich petroleum states might want to say, the name of the body of water sorrounded from the south by the Arabian Penninsula, from the north by Iran, and from the west by the Strait of Hormuc is and has always been the PERSIAN Gulf. The Romans called it Sinus Persicus, and all around the world, it is known by that name, the Persian Gulf. It is NOT an ethnic case, it does not have to do with political domination (although that's what Arab States want). It is just A name!"
3,Honorable writer,"Mr. T. Potts is an honorable writer who tries to uncover mysteries of this great ancient region. He goes to a lot of detail work to do this great job. However, I just cann't understand why he refers the Persian Gulf as the Arabian Gulf. This is a colonial matter which we english people introduced in the time of colonisation to divide people and concur them. I deeply regret his use of this wrong name."
1,Arabian Gulf is NOT on Earth!,....and most likely the material is also researched in an imaginary state of mind. How can one proceed from the cover when not even a single map was consulted? Please take the book to your Arab masters to wrap fish with its paper - if they can find a single fish in that gulf that is.
5,"Great Story, But Not At That Price","This is the only Dame Frevisse episode I have yet to read, and I probably won't be able to read it for some time. I assume it is out of print and rare, as the prices of available copies of the paperbck are outrageous. I can't believe any of the sellers can sell this book for the prices being asked. Something is definitely wrong here. Greed?"
4,The Murderers Tale.,"The main character of this story suffered from epilepsey and the story showed how greed for position and powercorrupted a cousin, but also showed how some people showed compassion to the sufferer. A good mystery which kept your interest to the end."
5,Triangle of power...,"Kristin Hersh referred to being in a three piece band as being within 'a triangle of power'. That triangle (Hersh, uber-drummer David Narcizo and underrated bassist Bernard Georges) has produced one of the most solid and urgent listens of the 1990's. From the propulsive power pop of 'Bright Yellow Gun' to the loud and sexy 'Start', 'University' corrals all of Hersh's elements and displaces them throughout this superb album. An album not to be missed by a band that helped to define the modern rock sound that, in turn, lent itself to today's alternative."
5,A Throwing Muses essential,"University is, flat out, one of the best rock albums of the nineties (so is the Muses' other ""masterpiece,"" The Real Ramona). University is louder and more immediate than its predecessor right from the first song (Bright Yellow Gun). It's a wide ranging album, expanding on the pop-rock sensibilities found in The Real Ramona with songs like Shimmer and Bright Yellow Gun, but also showcasing slower, melodic tunes (Crabtown, Snakeface), and more aggressive works (Hazing, Shimmer). The Muses are in top form here; Hersh's songwriting is excellent and the band presents a coherent, uniformly excellent album. If you like inventive, aggressive rock music, this album is for you."
1,A masterwork of the supeficial,"Stephen Kern read a lot, writing his book. His study is a conglomerate of the most important authors, sociologists and philosophers focusing on the shift of time and space concepts in modern Europe. The broadness of his knowledge is the lack of his book, because it is nothing else than a masterwork of the superficial. Combine a little bit of time-philosophy in the novels of Proust, a little bit of brainstorming (Molly Bloom) in Joyce, combined with Einstein, James, Husserl (!), Bergson, Ibsen, etc. and you have a good pseudo-cultural-philosophic consommé. The book is mixture of articles you find in encyclopedias. I am very disappointed, especially with Harvard University Press."
4,Give me Garvey... for my mashed potatoes,"A CD of this final LP of the D'Abo Manfreds has been a long time coming. It contains the lyrics (in Japanese), an inserted reproduction of the (much shorter) US LP version's cover, and the UK cover work. The stereo, while impressive, sounds like the analog LP version, if such things will keep you up at night, while the mono is just a compressed version of the stereo, unlike last year's ""As Is"" reissue, which was a totally different mix. Still, the sound is gorgeous (although still cursed, as was the LP, with fake stereo versions of ""Mighty Garvey"" -not GRAVEY; where are their proofreaders? - and ""Ha ha said the clown""). So, good art, great stereo - fake mono? I'd gladly buy it anyway. And you should too."
5,Extremely happy with this crib set...,"The colors are beautiful, great quality, and the price amazing!!! Got it for nearly 70% off retail price!! I have been looking for a colorful sea themed crib set for a long time. Every time I found something I liked it was either out of stock, not colorful enough, or discontinued. There are a few sets out there that are similar to this one, but not quite as beautiful. However, a lot of the accessories for the Freckles Reef set are hard to find, but with the variety of colors in the set, it's not too hard to find and match accessories from other brands to this set. Love it!!"
2,Just OK,Purchased as a gift from a baby registry. Both myself and the Mother-to-be was disappointed in the quality of the product but liked the pattern when we opened it at her baby shower. Not a brand I will be purchasing for future baby showers.
5,Colorful & Fun Crib Set,"I purchased the Freckles Reef 4 Piece Crib Set. It came with crib skirt, sheet, bumper and quilt. I love this set!! My nursery is an ocean themed nursery so we painted the top half of the room ""swimming"" a vibrant light blue and the bottom half ""morning sun"" a bright pale yellow and this set goes so well with the paint. We are not finding out what we are having and I love these bright colors that are fun for either a boy or girl."
3,TortElvis is the NEW KING!!!,"There are a lot of reggae bands out there, fronted by an Elvis impersonator, who are doing Led Zeppelin songs, but DREAD ZEPPELIN remains the best. ""Hot and Spicy Beanburger"" probably isn't as good as ""Dread Zeppelin I,"" also known as Un-Led-Ed, but it has lots of classic tunes. My favorite is ""Kashmir."" Charlie Haj hands TortElvis his water and towels onstage. If you love Led Zeppelin like I do, and if you have a sense of humor, check it out. You'll laugh the first time, but you'll play it again and say, ""Ay mon, this isn't too bad!"""
5,Good Book in a Series on Ninjutsu,"Anyone interested in the true history of the Ninja and how Ninjutsu exists today should review the books. While it is difficult to cover everything in an art as complex as Ninjutsu, the series will give you a good overview. Forget the movies!"
5,Fantastic,Wonderful product. A variety of tools to create your very best artwork. Love this!I posted a picture of a drawing I made using this product! It's the little girl holding her head in her hands.
3,Pencils,"Looks great, got it for my brother and it looks like he'll love it. Can't wait to see him enjoy it."
4,Christmas Gift,I gave it to my granddaughter for Christmas. She loves to draw. It will be used a lot during school break.
5,Art King,I bought this gift for my pre-teen. He uses it everyday. he loves it. i am very satisfied with this purchase.
3,teddy bears or chipmunks,"When my daughter, who had just turned two, saw a chipmunk sing a long video in her grandmother's collection, she called them teddy bears. She is a big fan of teddy bears so she quickly requested watching it. It's always best to humour a two-year old so I let her and to my surprise she loved it. So I got her Rockin' with the Chimpmunks. She doesn't seem to like it nearly as much as Working on the Railroad chipmunk video, but she likes it some. I really think early teens and preteens would enjoy it the most. Adults may like it for sentimental reason, as it has a lot of old clips in it."
4,Great for children who love music.,"This will do just fine for my grandsons ages 4 & 8. They love music, especially rock and roll and they love the Chipmunks! Nice Seller and fast delivery."
1,Mingus on sedatives,"I never thought the music of Charles Mingus could be made to sound so unemotional. The performance is lifeless compared to any of the originals. Wynton Marsalis's latest effort to score a historical piece for an orchestra again fails. As with Coltrane's A Love Supreme, the original small group performance set the bar very high. That is not to say that any attempt to score these works is a guarenteed failure (see many recordings by the Mingus Big Band). The reason these works fail along with many other of Marsalis's are due to a lact of emotional fire, and originality (the artist must at least attempt to provide some personal statement to the piece, or all you can to is compare it to the original)."
2,This just doesn't work,"This is just another bland recording from Wynton Marsalis. AS compared to the recordings of the Mingus Big Band, these tracks are unemotional and poorly executed, despite the talented band personnel. It is more about ""big band"" than it is about Mingus and as such this CD lacks character, emotion and doesn't reflect much understanding of Mingus' music. Pass this one by and try the Mingus Big Band recordings if you want to hear another take on Mingus' composing."
3,Cute sandals but not good for walking,"They're cute and not too uncomfortable to wear. However, they're not right for long distance walking. The edge of the band would cut the skin slightly. But I have quite a few compliments from people when wearing this pair."
5,Try 'em!,"I just started playing around with the guitar after many years of letting it sit in the closet. A friend plays a lot in a band and suggested Cleartone strings. He swears by them. Great feel and sound, plue he says they last much longer. He has tried other coated strings and didn't like their sound. So, my old guitar needed a new set and I got the light Cleartones. I'm very happy with them. They sound great and feel nice. You'd never know they were coated/treated. I'd definitely suggest everybody give them a try."
5,Highly recommended,"Really fun craft toy can create window stickers for any small tracing picture, not just the Madeline pictures included. My daughter loves this product!"
4,The stress test.,"Ken Akamatsu, Love Hina, vol. 7 (Tokyopop, 1999)I've been thinking on and off about complaining about the incredible stupidity one finds here (and in most relationship comedies), that of the characters just being too stupid to actually talk to one another, but somewhere in the middle of this volume, I came to realize that, really, most of us were that stupid in high school. Of course, most of us probably didn't have to deal with Keitaro's complicated life. New complications arise: is Mutsumi really the girl he made the promise to? Fun series. ****"
2,OK product,"this product was as described, but is lacking in the durability department. It is pretty flimsy and the buckle is made of stamped sheet metal."
2,Not real happy,When ordering this belt was expecting a little more. The webbing is not very substantial the buckle does not adjust easily and the measurement was off by about 6 inches. Not highly recommending it.
5,Good quality belt,"Just got this belt and seems to be made very well. The belt itself is thick and strong and the buckle appears to be good quality as well. Not sure why there are negative reviews on this item, seems top notch."
3,"BDU belt 44""","a little hard to adjust, it does stay in place. I had to cut back the belt as it was a little big."
1,Not a very good product,"Product is NOT 44"", you would be better off buying from a surplus store, not what I expected at all."
1,Trash,"The belt is so difficult to make work that it is useless. The buckle is cheap, as us the webbing. Don't waste your money on this one. Seductively priced, but a waste of even a dollar."
1,Not what I expected,Was way smaller than what I orderd it said 44 inch and was about a 40 inch belt that is why I rated this a 1 star
2,Wayyy too stiff,"I bought this belt for my husband since his then-current canvas belt was getting a little worn and he can't wear this one. It might be fine for someone who has a completely flat stomach, but this belt doesn't bend or give at ALL; the stiffness is so bad that it doesn't even take 15 minutes for it to loosen up to the point that it's usefulness is just non-existent. I mean, the only other belts that I know of that are this rigid are brand-new leather belts. I'm just going to have to really make sure we stick to canvas from now on, which is disappointing since they are so hard to find for less than $15."
2,Couldn't stomach it,"It's a shame that all the nutritional benefits of this bar went to waste on me because I couldn't even stomach the darn thing. It's literally just a block of chewy mush with the sharpness of dark chocolate. There were even some random chunks of who knows what stuck in there. I've tried the creamy citrus flavor as well, and that I could at least get down."
2,yuk,"I received a free sample power bar through the Vine Program and looked forward to trying it; when it arrived I was babysitting two preteens, so we each had a portion and all of us agreed -- yuk! I'm giving this item 2 stars because the flavor was fine; though one child said it tasted ""like vitamins"", I think he meant the good fruit-tasting vitamins. The problem with this bar is the texture -- it is VERY gummy, and even stretched a bit when we cut it into portions. As one chews, it becomes rubbery; in the interest of this review I had to force myself to finish my one-third portion because it was so unpleasant. If you're prepared for the texture you may enjoy the fine flavor, but otherwise I'd suggest you steer clear of this energy bar."
1,Berry power bar,"This item was part of a multi item order. Would have been nice to know upon ordering, rather than when the order was received, that the item is on back order."
3,Candy bar,Too sweet for an energy barNeeds to reduce it's sugar contentVery hard to swallow after one week even at just one bar a day
5,Power Bar Peanut Crunch,"Perfect food for on the go. No chocolate, just peanut butter. That and a glass of water will keep you filled for hours."
5,Great performance bar!,"I'm not a big fan of energy bars, but these are great! They taste good and they're not dry like so many others. They also don't upset my stomach or give me the runs, which is very important."
1,Expiration Date Long Past,"Disappointed. Did not expect to receive expired product from Amazon. PowerBar food product arrived with product expiraton date four (4) months expired. Am returning product to Amazon. As usual, with Prime, shipping was fast and returns are easy (but irritating). From now on I'll consider non-food items only. PowerBar product is good, when fresh."
3,Great exercise for your jaw muscles.,"If you've never had one of these, do yourself a favor and try one before you commit to an entire box. They're sweet, sticky, and really chewy, and they'll do a great job of giving you energy and killing your appetite. That may actually be a good thing, depending on the context.I don't eat these much lately, but there was a time when I was very busy at work, and I didn't want to take a half-hour for lunch and pay $7.00, and I didn't bring my lunch, but I had a box of these and it took only one to get me to totally forget about food for several hours. Power indeed."
4,"Not magic, just convenient calories and carbs...","You need a magic tonic to help you recover following a new personal best? Good luck funding one.You want a candy bar? Keep looking.However, if you want a well-packaged, carb-rich bar that won't melt in your hands, that will give you a sugar replacement that 15 minutes following your intense activity lasting 45-60 minutes, then this PowerBar Performance Energy Bar might work for you.Nonfat chocolate milk might work just as well, but it certainly won't last 12 months in that pack under your bike seat or in your backpack's side pocket.Know what you are getting, and use it appropriately. Then you won't be disappointed!"
2,Caramel Cookie Original Power Bar,"I like Original Power Bars (although none of my friends do). I also like caramel. I was very disappointed with this flavor however and will not get it again. Personally I prefer: Cookies and Cream, Vanilla Crisp and Chocolate.2 boxes are a lot to buy unless you have tried the flavor before."
3,"One tough ""cookie""- needs to be thoughtfully chewed",The concept is great -- concentrated energy in a tasty bar -- but they are so tough and chewy -- ever tried to eat one halfway thru a hike? It's like trying to swallow cardboard -- I need to drink ALOT of liquid when I have one of these bars -- why not make then juicier???This would be good in a camp setting-- it takes alot of chews to really get this one down.If you have any loose dental work -- use the goo or the gel instead.
1,"My two boxes are sitting at home, somewhere....","Stuff is very difficult to eat, its like chewing gum, except it sticks to everything inside your mouth and eating one makes you very thirsty. I must say I was disappointed when I received them. Ive had 4 or 5, and the rest, well they're sitting somewhere in my closet, for good."
2,Not what I expected,"These bars were tasty but they were also 'sticky'. It was sometimes difficult to get the wrapper off, and when I could get it off they would stick to my fingers"
3,flavor and texture are greeat..,Excellent source of calories and protein. Outstanding flavor. Terrific snack I use on the golf course for extra energy and protein. The flavor and texture are satisfying and it doesn't leave a metallic aftertaste as some bars do.
1,Shipping,The power bars were poorly packaged and were mashed into permanently squashed shapes. I was very dissatisfied. I would not recomend anyone making the same mistake
5,YUM!,"I just love the Power Bar Oatmeal Raisin bars. Now only are they yummy, they give me the get up and go that I need in the morning to get up and go.I'm having them auto shipped to my door. I get free shipping and they are considerably cheaper then in the store."
3,cool bars,good snack if on a diet or working out.Ate these years ago they killthe hunger and not to many calories.
3,"product was so, so","Item came on time. Looked like box had been opener and resealed before shipping. Bars weren't that fresh and taste was ok. Hadn't tried that flavor, before but worth a shot."
2,"These arent how I remember them, new formula?","I looked for these everywhere because they are my favorite powerbar and they only carry them online not instores anymore, I think they changed the formula or something because they are definatly not how i remmeber them.TThey are worse, i lied them before, now I dont eat powerbars anymore because they taste like rubber."
5,Great trumpet jazz,"Farinacci is one of the best jazz musicians I've heard in years. His trumpet playing is comparable to the greatest out there, if not better. He has a unique style which shows his mastery of his instrument, and is truly hard to believe since he is only in his early twenties. This CD is great listening, and I highly recommend it."
3,Need adaptor to connect with other track!,"We were so excited to get this bridge for Christmas. What a surprise and dissapointment when my 3-year-old wanted to make a big track with her other Thomas pieces and we found it is IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT BUYING AN ADAPTOR. This dumb bridge comes with TWO FEMALE ENDS. Are you kidding me? So it sits in the corner until we spend another $10 or so on adaptor pieces and wait for them to arrive. I think it's pretty cheap on the part of the company to not even put this little fact in the description.As for the toy itself. Good quality and, once we get the adaptor, I think will be a nice addition to my daughter's set."
2,not very well thought out,"My two year old son picked out this bridge and loves it... but does not understand yet that it is very frustrating for anyone trying to do more than collapse it! As said in other comments... two female ends!! It should definitely have come with an adapter for the price. Also, many of the engines DO NOT FIT through the bridge opening!! These are the wooden trains I'm talking about. I did not have a problem with the collapsing being too tight or too loose, but with the other problems... I do not recommend this product."
5,Great for Thomas Fans,This is an excellent addition to a Thomas and Friends wooden railroad set. I remember watching Thomas the Tank when I was a kid. It was a fantastic show then and is still a big hit with kids. This bridge can be collapsed when you push the button and then it comes back into shape again with another push of the button and is ready for railroad traffic.
2,High hopes for bridge fall short,"My son really enjoyed playing with this bridge on the sample Thomas tables available in a few local toy stores so, I was excited to include this feature on his train table. That said...the bridge simply doesn't work. The Thomas Wooden trains cannot pass under the bridge so you need to set the bridge up on an outside track away from other features that might be blocked by the height of this thing. Also, contrary to previous reviews the buttons to push on our bridge are way to tight for my toddler to manage on his own (unlike the more broken in versions of this bridge he has used while shopping) so, we'll have to see if this bridge gets better with more use. Overall this really could have been designed with more thought & I'll be looking for a better bridge alternative for our table."
2,broke 1st day!,my son is 4 years old and i bought this for his 4th bday. the first time he played with it the damn thing broke and he is not a rough kid at all!
3,Not much,"I truly expected much more information out of this book, It was just a little bit of winding up style detailed information, which I already knew from my experience living with my neurotic wife :-( It is though useful if you plan to get married with neurotic one but, I hope nobody wanna do that voluntarily :-)"
5,Do you belive?,I personally did not believe in Ghosts. This series made me believe. Specifically the EVP ( Electronic voice phenomena) just amazed and puzzled me. In this series you will see things that are unexplain and will have you wondering about the afterlife. Also be prepared for a few scares I jumped several times in this season. I would recomend buying this season.
2,"Boring, last CD won't play","I've bought my last Ghost Hunters set. All of the personality seems to have gone out of this group, not to mention this is the second time in a row that one of the CDs won't play. Waste of money."
3,Got Guts,"I love this show, kinda cheezy production, typical for sci fi channel. Jason and Grant Rocks"
3,I LOVE THE GHOST HUNTERS SERIES,"But i only give it 3 stars because the dvd actually messes up in 2-3 episodes, then freezes then goes back to main menu. It is bizare because it is in excellent condition. Every dvd is completely clean, but whenever i get to those episodes it begans to pixel really bad."
4,I love it!!,I love ghost hunters it has to be one of my favorite shows!! I cant wait to get the next season!!!=+D
4,Ghost Hunters Season 3-Part 1,One great series of actual real ghost hunting. A very real show and no special effects needed.
4,Vampire Culture shock,"A really enjoyed this kick off of the Slayer vamp series. Alek is a terrific character and I look forward to reading more of him in time to come. Excellent in places, murky in others, but still a good read. The opening sentences are very good and draw the reader in.Such a culture is hard to get right but Karen did a super job."
2,Not nearly as good as the reviews,"I would have to say that the reviews of this book are better written then the book itself. First, to be picky, the amount of typos in this book are astoundong. Now I realise this has nothing to do with the author but come on. Give it a proof read or something. The story itself was pretty poorly written. While the pace is quick as I have read in other reviews, the reason it is quick is the author does a poor job of giving details, somtimes extremely important to the plot, that are needed to further the story. I am not saying it is a horrible piece of garbage but definitely a below average novel"
3,Good But Sloppy Research,"This is a fun read. My main problem with this book is the fact that Hanzo Hattori was never a master sword forger. If proper research had been done, the author would have known that Hattori Hanzo was the leader of a ninja group, but he was never a forger of swords. His kenjutsu skills were most probably exemplary, but there is a big difference between a swordsman and a sword forger. And when writing a book that has a historical figure such as Hattori Hanzo in it, care must be taken to ensure the facts are correct. In this case, it spoiled the story for me."
4,KOBE BRYANT,"This book was pretty good but there was one part in the book that you didn't put. You should of listed where he lived, how old he is, what his life was when he growing up, whats his mom's like and what his friends were like."
4,what I know...,"This is a book about Japanese Americans living in Hawaii. It is a useful book for people studying American Studies. Lots of teachers recomend this to their students or require them to read this, especially here. I read this book and I thought this was pretty throughal...."
5,Great Short Collection,"This collection of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's work is a fantastic snapshot of the great romantic poet. Included in it are his two great poems, ""The Rime of the Ancient Mariner"" and ""Kubla Khan."" Additionally, my two favorites, ""Lewti"" and ""Love"" are in the collection. Coleridge builds amazing worlds from his education and his opium habit that still astound the reader. Anyone who is looking to read some Coleridge should pick this one up."
3,Other Books,"A good cheap trippy collection from Dover, is Samuel Taylor Coleridge'sThe Rime of the Ancient Mariner and Other Poems, and that is how welike our poetry, cheap. This includes quite a few, and has Kubla Khan,if it didn't, I certainly would not have purchased it. So if you areafter the title track and that so to speak, this one will do you."
3,Dark but Funny,This is a dark comedy that is worth watching. The script is good and it will make you laugh at the worst possible moment.The ending could have been a little bit better and that's why I gave it the 3 stars.I recommend it.
3,"Portrait of a Loser -- and, not really a comedy","While this non-comedy is inaccurately advertised on its DVD case as a comedy -- misleading one to think it's a somewhat light chick-flick -- the portrayal of the lazy, self-absorbed no-ambition loser depicted by Casey Affleck is right on. Fortunately, the girl-too-good-to-be-true tumbled to his absolute worthlessness after a bit, and made the right choice -- and let's just hope she followed through with her decision, ""after"" the end of the story.The acting was all good, the tale was somewhat interesting (though depressing), and a couple of narrative details were quite implausible. Still, everyone in time encounters total losers like Jim, and definitely emerges wiser from the experience."
2,A Porcupine-Like Family,"Some movies create situations to kick start character revelations. Others use the camera to flitter over tham quickly to avoid it. Casey Affleck does a terrible acting job, with a stone face and bland monotone voice that makes it hard to even focus on the content of his words at times. Two stars only for the cool drawings of fatalistic novelists on his wall (Ernest Hemingway actually may be the most interesting character in this film ;-D) I've never seen a romance that I wanted to reach into the screen, press one palm firmly against each of the girl's cheeks and shout ""run, run, you whiskey chugging dollfaced nurse; run for your life!"""
2,Just too miserable to be enjoyable,"I know this is supposed to be a dark comedy, but it's too heavy on the darkness and too light on the comedy. I think it's well acted...but the characters are not likeable and they just don't manage to redeem themselves....even at the end."
3,Backing a production,A looking-young-about-thirty character by C. Affleck returned home after doing a term just to find him dragged into a drug-dealing at a family business during free from bedroom-exercising time at his parents place.His hairy back is a very positive asset to this work.
5,The best ever,"Good Seasons Garlic & Herb dressing is the very best salad dressing ever. Every time I serve it someone will comment on how delicious it is and ""you must give me the recipe,"" It is not carried in most the of super markets in my area so when I see it I buy all they have. You will always find in my pantry. Except today, I used my last packet last night and have to go to town to get more. Hope they have it."
2,Sorry but...,"Although a long time PFM fan, who has ''adapted'' to the various styles of PFM during more than 3 decades, SREENDIPITY just not appears to be my cup of tea at all. I have tried and tried over and over again, but this album rarely goes on my CD player anymore. A couple of tracks that I like, and that's about it. These guys have used us to much better stuff than this relatively uninspired, pop, heavy and predictable album. Not up to what these guys are capable of doing.At the time that I'm writing this review, PFM is still working on a new studio album to be released in October of 2004.Rumor has it (coming from people close to the band) that it should be a great (and more on the progressive side) one this time."
1,more junky art supplies,"Listen up parents. Spare yourself the money and invest it in books rather than in this junk made in China by slave labor so that Ms. Frank can maximize her profits and live a profligate life style. Those of us who live in Tucson and have had dealings with this woman know that she would steal your wallet given half a chance. She doesn't pay the people that work for her a decent wage and sometimes doesn't pay them at all, depending upon her wealth to sue anybody that wants to challenge her. Why hasn't she hired Americans to produce her products? Besides, the products produced by Lisa Frank are generally without any merit at all. Buy your kids a box of crayons and drawing paper and let them create themselves. Surely their art will exceed that of this fake. I have reviewed Ms. Frank's products and not only are they without educational merit, the art work is abominable, amateurish.... A decidedly thumbs down for this junk."
5,Elemis Deep Drainage Body Cleansing,"I really love theElemis product, it works just like it said. My goal was to eliminate the belly bulge and it did just that, I will order it again and definitely recommend it to friends."
1,Don't waste you money on snake oil products,"This product was a complete waste of money, It does nothing to help you loose weight of speed up your system. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IT A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY"
4,Worked for me,"Cal-Metab + Deep Drainage definitely helped me lose weight and reduced my appetite. However, Silhouette and Vitality were a waste of money."
1,Swedish Product,"They sell this on Cruise Line Ships at much larger prices. Carnival is where it purchased mine. It does nothing.... everything has to be done as a WITH or you get no results. Don't expect miracles, nothing is a miracle when it comes to body fat and contouring."
1,Waste of Money,This product advertised results are bogus. It did nothing for me. I wish I could get my money back. Don't waste your money on these products promoted on the cruise ships. They must pay the cruise ships well to lie the way they do.
1,Nonsense!,"I almost bought this aboard a cruise line but had enough common sense not to get the entire line for a year and a half. However, when I got home I decided to buy one bottle of the Elemis Deep Drainage. What a joke on me! I wish someone had told me about the product and how it is pushed on every cruise line! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
1,Caveat Emptor,"I bought this product on a Princess Cruise. My only excuse is that the fitness instructor selling it had a really good rap -- about $600 worth. Much of what he said I knew to be true. He is, in my opinion, a very good snake oil charmer. I just have to laugh now because once you buy it, you're out $600.00.There is no magic bullet for health and wellness. Eat mostly vegetables, get adequate protein, exercise and lots of water. Don't drink a lot of alcohol. You'll be just as fine.I gave it one star because there may be some benefit in the product. Who the hell knows? You wouldn't know without a longitudinal study with a control group with specific controls and objectives. That will never happen.My advice: Save your money, find an exercise you enjoy, and eat a plant based diet. To good health, and not getting ripped off!"
2,LittleSpaceBetweenWords,"The content of this book is very good, but make certain your eyes can handle the strain of reading it. For some reason the font was tinkered with to eliminate most of the space between the words. Buyer beware! Prepare for eye-strain headaches while you're reading this book. It's bad enough to make an otherwise 5-star book into a 2-star book.Shame on the publisher, or perhaps on the content providers who couldn't stand to trim a few sentences here and there in order to make the book readable."
5,"It`s very nice,but the paper is not for fountain pen","It is a valentine's gift from my beloved wife. The size is just right for my bag, the cover touches softly . Love it. It would be perfect if the credit card slot can be a little bit bigger,and the paper must be thick enough for fountain pen."
3,Sundown-So So,"I had high hopes for the movie the awesome Bruce Campbell, the classic Carradine, and the incredibly attractive Elizabeth Gracen, and a vampire movie to boot. (where Campbell is a descendant of Van Helsing) But the movie was not as good as I hoped. The story was interesting, it just didn't really work."
4,This movie is FUNNY!,"Just think what a town of sunblock-smeared vampires would look like if they were trying to ""fake it,"" then pump in the laughing gas! A synthetic blood plasma plant, ASH as von Helsing's great (and inept) grandson, and homage scenes to various vampire flicks. If it wasn't so tongue-in-cheek it wouldn't be so funny!"
4,This is a really fun Vampire movie!,Great silly Vampire flick!! How bad can any movie be with Bruce (ASH) Campbell in it. Go for it!!
2,bruce campbell fans can skip this,"This is for Bruce Campbell fans: If you're looking to buy this because the coolest B movie star ever is in it, don't bother. The movie is dumb, not the kind of dumb that's kitchy and good. I mean just dumb. Bruce is in it yes, but his character makes no sense. In fact, this movie just makes no sense. Put evil dead back in you dvd player, or hold out for Bubba Ho Tep, or reread his book. But don't bother with this. I give it two stars only because Bruce is in it."
5,Hilarious. Silly. And a dang fine vampire comedy.,"Well as the description pointed out, the vampires are living a boring and sedentary life while their local brainiacs to to better the artificial blood they live on. Sunscreen 5 Million helps them hang out in the daylight so nobody will be suspicious at a deserted town.Shame on the character cast here for not mentioning veteran actor John Ireland. Been waiting years for this DVD."
2,A Little Bit Dissapointed to Say The Least,"I am a huge Bruce Campbell fan, so when I saw him on the cover of this box I had an expectation for a campy, cheesey, B-film with some blood and gore...well, it was campy and cheesey, but more like a D-Film! There is really no blood and gore and for Bruce being on the cover he had very little screen time.David Carradine tries and (for the short amount of time he spends on screen) so does Bruce Campbell, but the story is weak, the acting is poor and it leaves a lot to be desired. It does have a lot of pretty cool special features including some interviews with Bruce Campbell and some behind the scenes stuff.I'm not saying don't give it a shot, I'm just saying don't get your hopes up like I did! Like I said, I love Bruce Campbell, but this is bad...even for him!"
4,sundown,"well dont let the four and five star misled you its a three star but its well made and done with some know actors and great cast of old timers but if you think its a three star you will think its better than that . but it does the vampire story but in a new tist. but like chickn food how many ways can you serve it and its still chicken food. i like its a comedy and and two kids are cute and good actors, with not so much gore in the movie ."
3,For those approaching large family gatherings...,"A Wedding is as useful a preparation for a large family gathering (wedding, funeral, anniversary, grandparent birthday) in its way as, say, ""Mr Blandings Builds his Dreamhouse"" is for a would-be remodeler. It won't make the experience you live through any better, but you may be humoured to know you are not alone in having had to go through it.-dB"
3,Minor Altman effort,"Altman's direcotrial virtuosity and ability to blance various different character who are all interwoven in some way is a feat I have always admired about Altman as a filmmaker . While not in the same league as McCabe & Mrs. Miller, Nashville or Short Cuts A Wedding does have some amusing vignettes and a good cast, particularly Paul Dooley and Geraldine Chaplin. Recommended mainly for Altman completists like me. Robert Altman is truly one of the greatest satirist of modern American Cinema."
1,disappointed,"The film is slow from beginning to end. There is not a character portrayed with the least likeablity, with perhaps theLillian Gish as the only exception, and she is dead throughout most of the film. In all, the film is life negative, without any social redeeming value."
5,Classic Altman,I love to introduce friends to this Altman classic and watch the horror on their faces as the superb cast does its work. Everyone is great and the escalating cringe-factor as the movie goes on is the best!One of my favorites.
4,A little bit of a change of pace.,"I just bought the hardback of this last night. I read it in one sitting, though I had cheated by reading the first few chapters at Baen's website. It's an excellent book, which I stongly recommend. I did not enjoy it quite as much as the first two in this series\universe, but that may be because the shifting settings in the book. Again, though, it's a great book which I recommend to fans of this series in particular and the genre in general."
3,Could have been better,"Having read March Upcountry and March to the Sea, I preordered this book and waited anxiously for it. I have to say I was disappointed. I was hoping for a wrapup to the trilogy, instead we have 500 pages of improbable gore ending in another cliff hanger. The plot takes decidedly Manticorian flavor with too much court intrigue and not enough Marines in action. This would have been a great 3 book set. The setup for a fourth book is not subtle and makes me wonder how long the authors plan to milk this franchise. They're almost out of characters.I definitely won't pre-order the next volumn. I'll probably wait and read the reviews first."
3,"Enjoyable, but nothing new","First off, as I am a fan of Weber & Ringo I did like the book. I enjoy both of their styles, and I did like the previous two books. The new volume promised a good conclusion to an interesting amalgam of safari & space opera. However, I feel that the series is winding down rapidly into another series of ""hero & perky love interest"" space opera, with the occasional character whom you know and love dying badly. This book seems less of a conclusion to the series than a launching pad for Mardukans in space."
4,As good as the first book of the series,"I have read all 3 books of the series and liked the first and third book a lot. The second book, I was either ill or it just didn't fit quality wise with the first and third. I even thought about not reading the 3rd book because the second was rehash of first, not well constructed, left you frustrated because it used so many people's point of view, etc. however, not I am glad I did read the 3rd one and am looking for the fourth - sixth in the series."
4,exc military sf,"Continuing a very fine series, this book witnesses Roger coming of age---and the end of the line on planet. The next book, re-taking the Empire, no doubt, promises to be fascinating. The military slant on SF here is great if you like that sort of thing--tactics, strategy, weapons and force building. All with derring do. An intriguing series. It needs a bang up finish in the next book to be great."
2,March To The Stars,"Great book, although not as good as the first two. I only rate it low because the authors fragged us. The ending was SOOOO anticlimactic that I hereby call the authors to task. Hey guys, how about a little pocking closure? Did you have to kill off Captain Parner, and then leave us in the lurch to boot? We have lost too many friendly characters already. We sci-fi fans read for escape, not for unnecessary sadness. You have been unfair to the loyal readers who followed you through the ostensible trilogy. I fear that this Mardok batch is going to turn into something like Hubbard's boring-to-tears ten-volume ""Mission Earth"" series, as opposed to the wonderful ""Mutineers' Moon"" series. Shame on you authors for leaving us hanging like that! Shame again."
3,More politics coming,"I think John Ringo is a great (relatively) new author and I look forward to everything he writes. Until this book, his collaboration with the established David Weber worked well, with Ringo's humor and great writing about infantry combat and personalities blending well with Weber's space opera and political intrigue. But as this book progressed, I saw less and less Ringo and too much of Weber's repetitive treatment of politics in space empires. I was disappointed with the ending in several dimensions, and I'm pessimistic about how much room there will be for Ringo's part in the next book."
4,Good book to bridge to the stars,"Webe had to get him to the stars to get him home... so he did. No, it is not the book the others were, but it was OK. The next book, whatever it is called, should be better. I would give it a 3.5, but gave it a 4 since I cannot use partial points.The relationship with Desperaux has its problems, but overall well done."
2,Disappointment,"The first two books in the series were good escapist literature told with humor and good military scenes. They did have a tendency to kill off some likable characters, but not too many and could be forgiven. The third book seems to betray what went on in the first two. The characters were not quite true to form. The book felt rushed and done just to get it in print for a deadline. The ending was very disappointing. How could the authors kill off some of the best characters and leave the situation hanging? Science fiction authors are getting into a bad habit of dragging a series out for all that it is worth, resulting in boredom and aggravation on the part of the readers after a while. I hope the authors reconsider where they are going with this series. Right now, I am not looking forward to book 4."
5,Awesome doll!!!,"I found this doll on Ebay for 100 dollars, and let me say that it was completely worth every penny. The coolest part is the resemblance that Chucky has from the movie, from the scars to the eyes. The price of this doll is rising, so you better get it before it gets to high."
2,Outdated,"15-18 years ago I bought and read Joe Huver's book. It was a well written, informative and easy to read alternative to Patrick Hindert's tome in its time. Yet unlike alternatives by Hindert et al and Lesti, Garretson and the plethora of free information available on the Internet, which are regularly updated, with all due respect to Joe Huver, I wouldn't recommend paying $150 today unless you want an ""antique"" for your museum."
3,Not what I expected,"I am a Kindergarten teacher and all my kids share my appreciation for the Powerpuff Girls. I ordered this book in hopes of sharing it with the whole class, but it's more of a one-kid-book."
5,Excellent reading,I've been collecting shells for many years but i never thought of the complexity and perfection of their patterns! This book describes in a simple way the mechanisms that produce the surface decorations of shells. It takes reader in a fascinating trip in a world of algorithmic shapes and colors!
1,Loss of money,I perchased this book to learn how to search patents. But amdisaponted of it's contents. Near half of the book is appendix which can be easily got through USPTO. Only 32 pages are dedicated for patent search out of total 229 pages. You can learn more at USPTO.
3,Easter Bunny Celebration,"The Easter Bunny SUit was a hit with most of the kids older than 5 years of age. The babies meaning, ages between 1-2 years old were a little scared of the bunny. The eyes looks like the bunny is angry or something. It could of been made to look a little more friendly. Suit was ok for price you pay, would recommend better materials for the actual suit and to make more coverage with the back of the neck."
3,Good book,"This is good book with some very useful ideas, 3 stars only because its outdated. If your wanting to buy a tablet PC or make better use of one you already have this book would be worthwhile."
2,good book only if you follow every word,"it got the book and the first few chapter was trying to convince me how good Tablet PC is. Let's just get to the point of How to Improve my skill with this tablet PC. But instead 1/3 of the Book talks about after Market software that I don't really use. But the Book doesn't go into any technical Tips or short cuts, the parts that talk about handwriting recognition was only a few pages long. if you want more Detail about Your tablet Bay another Book. if you are a consultant and will Buy all the recommended softwares than try this Book."
5,miss the boys,"It had been awhile since i heard the Highwaymen and after listening to this CD went ahead and ordered a DVD. I was thankful i actually got to enjoy one of their concerts, there will never be a dupilcate"
5,Amazon needs to read the cover of this book!,"It would behoove the powers-that-be in the Amazon pantheon (or at least delegate an appropriate minion) to actually read the cover of the book that is pictured above. Were they to do this, they might find that the name of the author is Donald, not David, Hamilton.Perhaps we might be persuaded to assuage our censure in the supposition that one or more of them worked at one time for the New York Times or CBS Evening News."
5,"""GREATEST ENTERTAINER OF THE DECADE""","Without a doubt the sound and unusual talent with a guitar, as well as charismatic personality of ""BOBBY CASH"" will prove to make him one of the greatest entertainers of this decade and those to come. His original music in the form of true country style brings back what true country fans fear is being lost in the music industry today. This album, COWBOY AT HEART, and the story behind it will prove exactly what I mean. Having seen this artist at work and having the privilege of meeting him during his trip to Nashville as one of ""CMA 2005 Nominees for International Artist of The Year Award,""(from India), and witnessing his performances and audience reception on WSM-Midnite Jamboree at E.T. Troubadour Theater, (STANDING OVATIONS EVERYWHERE HE HAS PERFORMED) I was and am truly overwhelmed with his talent and songs. YOU MUST READ THE STORY BEHIND THE 'ONLY COUNTRY COWBOY ARTIST IN INDIA.' [....]"
5,Two of Red and Two of Blue,"I also read this as an adolescent. It was my favorite book from the bookmobile and I checked it out every time I could. I had been looking for this book for my own son, but never found it - now I know why.This is a great adventure, incorporating good and bad, courage and love of family, friends and country. We surely could use a book like this to be reprinted for kids today.I am a 60 year old woman and still remember that book with fondness. I think my grandson would also enjoy it."
5,An envigorating celtic sound,"""Tierra de Nadie"" is an amazing album consisting of ancient Celtic music that at one time flowed through the small but scenic country that is Asturias, in northern Spain. The invigorating sound of the Gaita (bag pipes) throughout, is very stimulating to the senses. Several of the tracks (eg. Añada) contain Celic hyms that transfoms you back to a time when the Celts ruled nothern Spain. Other tracks like ""Busindre Reel"" are very energetic while others such as ""Barganaz"" are soft and soothing in nature. I highly recomend this CD to anyone who is looking for a fresh sound to the ancient rhythms of Asturias."
3,Who doesn't like cookies & brownies?,"If you love cookies and brownies, and who doesn't, then you'll love this book!Even if you're not a cookie cooking professional, you'll be able to whip yp the best desserts on the block! (Be sure to share them with your neighbors, they'll be wondering what that wonderful smell is coming from your kitchen)!You'll learn cookie details, cookie decorating, and how to eat the cookies you've made before anyone else in your house finds out -- only kidding!Recipes include: shortbread, butter cookies, chocolate cookies, classic cookies, my favorite -- biscotti, along with cute sketches, great quotes, and a listing of ingredient and equipment how to's to keep you occupied while waiting for your treats to finish cooking!"
1,Worst book I ever read.....,"This book was written (?) by a guy who is member of the Argentinean government.As usually happens with those guys, they think people are stupid. The book is written for young men, but he treats them as little kids.Is frivolous and boring.This guy should spend sponsor's money in good causes."
5,Wendell Wilke and WW2,"This is a historical gem. It describes a much more constructive US political process existing at the time and a startling precient prescription of advice for honest cooperation among the Allies that had it been followed, might have prevented the Cold War and current tensions between China and the West."
4,Easy to use and comfortable!,"It is very practical and really a pack and go for your margaritamixer. The only reason I have given it only four starts is because the material of the outer-shell is a bitt weak or poor quality. Still, it is a must for all margaritalovers frequently on the road."
4,Quick & easy,"A friend has one of these. One weekend she decided to ""whip"" up some margaritas for us. It took no time at all & they were perfect every time. No more sticking a spoon in the blender to try & get all of ice chopped up, etc.My sister saw it & had to have one as well. SHE LOVES IT! She makes adult cocktails, kid smoothies, & even snowcones in it.The only reason I did not rank it a 5 was because of its price. For a blender, it is on the ""pricy"" side. Also, the size of the machine is overwhelming. You need a big spot on your counters or in your pantry to house this thing.Overall, if you blender things often, YOU MUST HAVE THIS!"
3,At least it has the real authors name,"Again, this book was not written by WWJ (since he died a few years ago) but it does have the real authors name. Anyways, this book is quite different than the last in the ashes series with it taking M-15 and current events into account.I saw it on the shelf at a book store and picked it up. Quite easy to read and believeable (for once)!"
5,View of the future?,With all that is currently happening in the USA I couldn't dismiss the possibility of this book actually happening. I'd be on the front if it did. Great read.
1,Invasion USA book review,"If I could provide zero stars, I would, but unfortunately I have to give this book 1 star. Had the authour noted the title has already been used in a 1985 Chuck Norris Movie? What will his next title be...""All Quiet on the Western Front?"". Aside from ripping off the title from another ""artistic"" work, this book is filled with cliches. Cartoonish in character development, boring in subject matter, one must ask ""Why I am reading this?"". I kept reading it as I could not beleive it was so bad. Zero original thought, zero style - was it written by someone in grade 9? The author should consider taking a night class at a community college on creative writing, and then perhaps realize he can't write, and then consider becoming a janitor."
5,great !!!,"Loved the way it peeled the skin and gave a good clean complexion when the peeling was over.I hated the peeling process however,cos it was so noticeable,no makeup cover I used could do a good masking effect,the peeling was brutal,but the after effect was worth it.Would buy again!"
3,Not if you've been spoiled by med spa peels,"This peel has a slight sting, not as much as when you get a peel at the med spa. I've had Jessner peels done before and this peel packed about a 3rd of the sting and zero peeeling. I got it with the intention of exfoliating a fairly new dark acne scar on my neck along with HQ 4% cream. I have medium olive toned skin. It didn't make it any better or worse but I have only used it 3 times so far. It hasn't made any overall improvements in the rest of my skin either. Going to try a stronger peel and/or back to the med spa!"
4,does what it says,"This product came with a small bottle of the salicylic acid peel, which i used beforehand. It was much stronger than this to me, but i dealt with it, plus it was nice that they included it in the package. I had yet to find something that would lighten the noticable dark places on my face but this has done it. i am in my early 40s and although my skin was not really bad, it has made a noticable difference, especially in the tone. it does tingle upon application but doesn't burn, and I had no peeling effect, but i am overall happy with it and will be ordering more."
3,Works... (to a point),"I'm of mixed/multi-racial heritage (mainly black/white), hence I have a medium brown complexion, nevertheless, it works rather well.Helps to fade dark spots to a certain degree, i.e. they're a lot lighter than they were, and perhaps not as noticeable.It also makes for a good, overall light facial peel.Addendum :I have since tried the Lactic Acid 70% Gel Peel, 100ml (re: http://www.amazon.com/Lactic-Acid-Peel-100ml-Professional/dp/B001THX07S/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top ) - And find this works much better, even if over a longer period!"
4,Worth using it,"I have had 4 peels, and the hyperpigmentation in my face has been broken and faded.I scrub it very gently, and only once for 4 minutes. I am going to complete the 6 peels, and rest for a couple of months before re-starting. Also, the bottle is still 3/4 full.I would recommend it."
3,Ouchies,This stuff worked the first couple times I used it but I made the mistake of leaving it on 7 minutes (it says up to 8) and it burnt my face really badly. It is excellent for spot treatment but it is extremely harsh for my sensitive combination skin and I would definitely recommend starting off with a less abrasive peel.
4,Good product,"I bought this chemical peel to fade my sun spots. It didn't quite happen all the way, but I still like the product. It makes my skin look younger and my pores smaller. Just be really careful!!! I burned my face a couple of times for leaving it on too long. The burns weren't noticeable and scabbed away quickly, but it's still better to use precaution. I don't recommend doing your entire face on the first try because if you are too sensitive to it you'll be really screwed.Overall, I like it. Once the bottle runs out I will buy a higher concentration."
3,"Glyco-Lac/60, Level 2 Gel Peel","It good but the money for the Glyco-Lac/60, Level 2 Gel Peel -30 ml/1 fl have to go down it is good"
3,Mia310,This is a very very light peel. I left it on for 3 min my 1st application and there was little to no discomfort and the results was very very small. I think this is a good product for those who are only trying to refresh the skin not reduce acne marks. I purchased this with a stronger product and my intention is to use it inconjunction with that product.
5,LOVES IT!,I have adult acne and acne scarring. I am a black woman and it has worked WONDERS on a problem I have battled my whole teen and adult life!!!! I'm 4 weeks in and my skin is sooooo amazing and CLEAR! OMG! I now use it on my 15 year old son who was curred with my skin!
4,Sensitive Skin,"I have rosacea and eczema with oily skin. I chose this and the salicylic peel from this company for exfoliation because I cannot use any manual exfoliation due to skin sensitivity. Both peels are wonderful and worked better than I expected. I cannot be sure which peel is the cause, but the areas with eczema problems are less sensitive and my skin is so much calmer overall. One suggestion to anyone who tries this with sensitive skin: I put the peel on my most sensitive patches of skin at the very end of the application process and never increase the time the peel stays on those areas."
3,not working for me good as other people stated,"Maybe I was expecting to much I have been using it for about 3 weeks now and I can see maybe 10% impr in my face, my scars are still there no peeling with this product."
2,Nothing..........,"I've had peels at the dermatologist's office before so maybe that was the problem. The strengths of these peels definitely do not compare. No tingling, no nothing. I have to step up the strength or maybe use an unbuffered version I guess."
2,Dangerous Product,"I have had professional chemical peels and have done some at home peel/exfoliate products in the past. This product is dangerous to use and I am still suffering the results 6 days after I used it. It burned my skin (left it on the 4 minutes suggested)....not discomfort while doing it. I did not go near my eyes with the product. Hours later, both eyes were puffy, one was actually quite swollen underneath and bruised with reds and light purples. The redness and puffiness has finally begun to subside (6 days later) The worst part is that the swelling accentuates the creases and lines around my eyes and the skin around my left eye looks about 20 years older than I am (I am 47). I highly recommend NOT buying this product."
3,Great.... for the first few weeks,"I really liked this product for the first few weeks. It didn't clear up my acne as much as I had hoped, but my face felt a lot clearer and smoother. After a few weeks though, it seemed as though my face was already used to it and I no longer had those good results I had before."
3,It's ok,I've been using it. I think it's doing good things for my skin. I don't really have problem skin so there wasn't anything to clear up. My skin gets dull so I was hoping this would help and it doesn't. Doesn't burn much at all. My face gets a little itchy. I don't leave it on for too long. I don't see any startling differences after I use it but that might just be my skin.
3,"So far, so good","I've used the product 4 times so far. I can't really tell if it's helping in any way. It does tingle when I put it on, and feels like it's working. I'll use it one more time and then stop for a while, as some other reviewer had mentioned that it shouldn't be used in the summer months."
3,i can't believe they sell this,"i'm a licensed esthetician with 7 years experience and i can't believe this is available to non professionals. this is a very strong acid peel and, in the wrong hands, could potentially damage the skin.if you really know what you're doing, it's a great peel and gives great results. but it's not for use by the general public and there are no instructions on how to neutralize this or regarding aftercare."
1,Ruined My Valentine's Day!,"I read each Amazon review on this product before I made my purchase and so I had full confidence in using this product the night before Valentine's. BIG MISTAKE! I left it on for only 50 seconds and the next day I'm left with a line through my upper lip....I was embarrassed to walk outside with a red looking mustache!I put pure aloe vera on it in hopes for it to soothe the burning, but that was a challenge in itself as well. My face felt so tight, it hurt to open my mouth wide enough to eat anything.Today is day two and I see light peeling and my red mustache is now a dark brownish color. I hope this chemical didn't burn my skin and left a scar! :("
1,Used It Last Night,"Hello, I have brought this a few days before it arrived pretty fast..!! the very next day..!! its actually my very first chemical peel i have some scaring on my face due to acne which i have been getting since i was a teen ager (now 24) i have a fair complextion but very uneven n dull as well as dark under eye circles..!!I have used this peel accouding to the directions and left it on for 2 min.. then rinsed very well for a long time..!! my face has tingling n burning effect which lasted a few hrs and was left with red spots on my face ..!!I really dont see any diffrence in my face exept for those ugly red spots on my left cheek n chin i hope thses spots go away soon and i hope this thing disnt burn my face..!!! WILL Continue to edit this if i see any healing"
1,Do not buy this product,Based on the product description it's a light chemical peel. What is a definition of light? I didn't feel or see any peeling at all. I'm very disappointed. Will not buy any product from this company again.
5,Awesome Album,"Excellent album for someone who was only familiar with ""Copperhead Road"". Cue it up and get your ""twang"" on. Especially good for a long distance road trip."
4,"Low budget, Great quality","My almost 3 year old daughter adores this movie. It has motivated her interest for sea creatures. I love to hear my daughter repeat parts of the movie ""mama is not hard to reach the stars!"" :)"
1,Scared my little girl and me!,"Okay, be warned. The villian in this cartoon is quite frightening to say the least. He is down right ugly. The graphics/animation sucks. I was looking for an alternative to Nemo (daughter watches like everyday) and this was not it! Will be selling this one to McKay's for sure!"
1,Absolutely worst movie ever! Do not show this to your children!,"This movie is horrible! The storyline is so confusing and stupid. It is scary and I can't believe I showed it to my children thinking it would be a cute cartoon. Before it was half over, I wanted to turn it off! Seriously the worst movie I've ever seen."
1,BAD MOVIE,"Plese don't show this movie to your children. I don't know how my daughter became acquainted with this awful movie, I think it was a free movie on Netflix my husband thought would be cute for her as she LOVES Nemo. Anyway, our Netflix kept skipping and I never watched beyond the opening scene so I had no idea what it was. My well-intentioned brother bought this for my daughter so she could actually watch it. TERRIBLE idea! About 10 min into it I wanted to stab my eyes out. I couldn't believe how scary the characters were (Even Nemo has a shark eating fish scene) but it was downright frightning. I now have to find a way to ""misplace"" this movie and hope my daughter forgets about it shortly."
1,awful movie,This is absolutely awful. I could not follow the story line (if there is such one). There is no connection between the scenes in the movie. Characters appear and go all over without having any reason to do so. The animation is terrible. This is probably the worst children's animated movies I have ever seen.
1,HA!,"I find it interesting that the positive reviews of this film all seem to come in packs during short spans of time, as if someone saw that the film's ratings were suffering and got friends together to all write good reviews.My friends and I like to watch hilariously bad movies, but this one was almost too much; we couldn't finish it. And I watched Howard the Duck the whole way through!Bad movie, plain and simple."
1,....Foreign Dreck..!,"..20th Century Fox looking for a quick buck from this imported loser..""Finding Nemo"" it aint..!..Such a BOMB they released it on December 7th..!!!"
2,book,did not find this story as one the granddaughters really liked. they have so many books it is hardto tell if they look and read it often
1,TERRIBLE MOVIE-DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"This was a terrible movie. It appears like a home movie...very poor cinematography. Storyline stupid. i was expecting a good cartoon movie...like Nemo..not even close. It was the worst...parts of the movie were quite frightening for kids. And there is ridiculous potty mouth humor, that really wasn't even funny. i could not find one thing redeeming about the movie. Sorry I wasted our money on it. My 4 yr old was bored & I hated it."
1,I want the hour and 26 minutes of my life back!,"We got this movie to enjoy with our children. They are 8, 6 and 4. From the moment the first character opened it's mouth... my husband and I were giving each other looks asking each other why we were watching this? It wasn't until the kids starting making fun of the movie that we all began mocking it! If a 4 year old can recognize how bad this movie really is... it should have never been made! The acting is terrible, the storyline was choppy, the voices of some of the characters were like fingernails on a chalkboard and the bottom line is that whoever funded this project should have his head professionally examined! I will say, however, that the colors were very pretty on a HD television... that's the ONLY positive thing I can say! It's not even worth a dollar to rent it at Redbox!"
4,Good Quality and Price,"I received a brand new headlight as a bonus,in a packaged parts deal and needed another by the same manufacture. Amazon was the best deal, and after receiving it was impressed at how the part was the same quality as the free one i had that was 5 years older...It's not an OEM part, so it does have slight dimension differences and the adjusters are a bit cheaper, but you can use your old ones if needed. The inclusion of a new headlight bulb is a bonus. It does the job for me, and that's all that matters."
5,Perfect fit - OEM quality,Excellent - looks just like a new OEM product. Fits very well. I am pleased with this product. Good price / value.
5,food processor recipes book,This is a really nice recipe book for food processors. We recently bought a food process and then had a difficult time finding appropriate recipes. This book has many. It arrived in very good condition.
2,Unheard of recipes,I wouldn't make very many of the recipes that are included in this book. Not my cup of tea.
3,Nice pictures but lacks detail,"Lots of inspirational pictures by the author and other artists, but there is little description of how some of the more interesting techniques were done, like accordian board books and other binding techniques. Found it overall a little disappointing, but at least it wasn't too expensive. Also I wish there was less use of scrapbooking supplies and more use of original background techniques or art papers."
4,Good Job,The book at time can be a bit choppy but it gives a great birds eye view of how the riot actually transpired. As a NYS Correctional Officer I found the book to realistically capture the behavior of both sides. It flows well once the reader gets to the events of the riot itself. I found it really worth reading.
3,The Devil's Butcher Shop,"I just had to write this comment to Kelly J. Barnett ""black_magic_7"". How could have read the WHOLE book and not known that NEW Mexico is part of the United States. Not MEXICO. We are that big empty space between Arizona and Texas."
1,A Startlingly Poor Book by a Good Author,"Roger Morris must be ashamed of this book. Morris can write quite well as seen in his excellent book ""Partners in Power "".But 'The Devil's Butcher Shop' reads like a bunch of disjointed newspaper articles taped together. How anyone, especially a talent writer like Morris, could take such a horrific incident as the New Mexico prison riot and make it boring is hard to fathom.I'm embarrassed for Morris if he's not, this book is really bad. If you want to read about prison life try ""Men Behind Bars"" by Wooden & Parker, it will scare you to death."
3,Good in the beginning,"I thought that this book was really good in the beginning. However towards the middle and the end, there was too much things going on. I wish that the author kept the plot more simple because it would have made this book more enjoyable and realistic. I literally felt disgusted and sick from all the events that happen to the heroine. This book is pretty dark and it's not for the faint hearted."
2,And this is a love story because........Huh?,"I painfully read the entire book hoping that this so called ""love story"" between Catherine and Sean would somehow rear it's ""fluffy"" head, however, It did not. This is a type of read that you will love or simply hate and all I could do was nod my head and say, ""what the hell was the author thinking""? There were many times when I actually felt guilty reading this book and hoped it was all a bad dream for poor Catherine. I swear after reading this book I was so depressed that I needed a glass of wine to unwind. I won't even bother getting in to the details about the book because there are no words to explain the negativity and cruelty of this story. All I can say is, Connie Mason, Johanna Lindsey, Kinley McGregor, etc.. I will never take you guys for granted ever again!!!! Give me all the fluff you want!!!!"
4,It's definitely NOT boring!,"I will say one thing. This is one damned twisted book. Definitely a love it or leave it kind of book. If you're looking for something that's emotionally gripping, I would suggest it.As far as the storyline goes (as disturbing as it may be to comprehend) I feel that the character's circumstances were true to the harsh realities of this time period. I also think that the hero has a serious case of bipolar disorder (but his turbulent emotions didn't disturb me as much as I attributed it to his ""inner demons""). This book could be described as deeply tragic, but in my opinion, tragedy often goes hand in hand with love...and I love tortured heroes."
3,Usable but messy,"I bought the book with the understanding it was used and not in new condition. I expected there to be some writing and highlighting in it. What I was not expecting was for there to be coffee stains on the cover and side edge of the book. Besides that and the heavy crease along the first few pages, the book is usable. It would be nice to have more details concerning the state of the book. Thank you."
4,Fantastic,"3 Colours Red are one of the best punk groups of the world even they are not only punk.Their ability to mix punk,rock,pop and metal makes them really special and their choruses are great.They are still not well known enough but they deserve to be cos they are great and lets hope that they will release more albums like Pure and Revolt In one word ... ESSENTIAL"
1,"Into my bin of ""Only One Good Song On It""","I bought the album to get one song, ""Beautiful Day,"" which is the only worthy song on the album. If only I had known about a certain magazine that included this one track on their sampler cd. I could have saved myself some money."
1,rubbish/one-hit wonder,"Revolt has one glorious song (""Beautiful Day"") and eleven awful ones. In fact, how the band came to write ""Beautiful Day"" given the cacophony that is the rest of the album is truly a mystery. If you liked the first album (""Pure""), you'll like ""Revolt""; it's the same awful poppy power metal garbage (except for ""Beautiful Day""). I feel misled/cheated/teased, etc. by the band. Do not buy this album unless you think one fantastic song is worth $16.00."
2,Dull,"It's one of the great ironies that bands which copy others do better than the original. If I want to listen to this type of music, I'll listen to the Wildhearts"
4,Not to be ignored!,"The Art of Intrusion is an excellent book. It is entertaining, informative, and helps you in understanding your threat level as an IT manager of your company. Who else can be a better teacher than Kevin Mitnick? Kevin, was an excellent social engineer, and if you will read more about him, you will also know that most of his attacks were not so technical, but he pulled them out successfully because of his social engineering skills.Don't expect this book to teach you some hacking skills. But, this one will sure make you aware of the situations when human beings turn weak and give an opportunity to social engineers who with their skills in computers can wipe or steal all the information stored on your company's IT systems. If you are managing a large IT Department, don't ignore this book."
2,A Little Off,"As a person who was intimately involved with one of the people profiled in this book, I can say that there are quite of bit of innaccuracies. It's too bad that more fact-checked, thoughtful and concise information was not pursued by the author. I think the author is more keen on self-massaging his ego with the added bonus of making a buck, rather than out to save the world.This book is all about, and written by, pernicious egoists. Nothing more."
5,Good read,"So far, so good. This is an excellent look at the exploits of hackers ... super interesting and really opens your eyes!"
3,Think like your Enemy/Prey,"I have mixed opinions about this book. Some of the chapters are pretty interesting while I found it difficult to keep my interest while reading others. For example, I found the casino hacking story pretty interesting (maybe that's why it's chapter 1) while Danny and William's hacks in the prison was utterly boring. Having said that I can't figure out what would've made the book more interesting. More details about the tools used and the intruded network might be boring for a popular audience while a generalized story makes one wonder 'where's the beef?.' I've a couple of more chapters to go; someday when I'm back in the mood I might get back to it."
4,Great summer reading with substance,"The author puts to paper an insider's view of the world of hackers, and does so in a very readable and engaging manner. Each chapter follows a different cast of characters and does so without the wink of approval; instead he uses these examples to illustrate how businesses and individuals can learn from them and avoid the risk of intrusion themselves. I highly recommend!"
5,A horror novel for network administrators! Awesome!,"As a network administrator for a state and federal agency, I am always concerned about the security of my network. Mitnik, while not Hemmingway, has an simple, interesting and fluid writing style that lends itself to even the most technically challenged. I have thoroughly enjoyed this book and recommended it to all my colleagues. It left me wanting more, and wanting to watch my network more."
5,Entertaining and Insightful,"A well written book that was insightful into the methods of hackers, as well as enjoyable from an entertainment standpoint through the telling of individual hackers' exploits. The stories themselves would be enjoyed by anyone with an interest or love of true-crime stories, and I think anyone in the field of network and corporate security, or even hackers for that matter would enjoy and glean useful information from this book."
5,THE definitive book on hacking,This is a compilation of Kevin Mitnick's rise thru the early days ofcomputer and phone hacking. A great read and very informative.
3,"These are computer hacking stories from the past, it's not a how to guide.","The book is a bunch of stories of computer hacking. Some are interesting, some are boring. Most of the stories have outdated hacking information so this isn't going to make much of a ""how to"" guide. However, you will find a few good pieces of current hacking information if you scour for them. I would give the book an average score because of it's lack of details and lack of current hacking info."
2,"A fast modem, but VERY tricky to configure with a soundcard",When this modem is installed I get great connections (44k - 48k average) but it causes a hardware conflict with my soundblaster live sound card which disables my sound. Tech support for this modem didn't provide any help because they said I have a faulty soundcard (which performs flawlessly without the modem installed). My reccommedation is to pay the extra money and get a US Robotics modem instead.
5,Fantastic,"I recently installed my Zoom 56K PCI modem and was very pleased with the easy installation. I consistently connect at speeds above 40,000 bps. When I was making the decision as to which modem to purchase, the ZoomGuard lightning protection feature on this modem caught my attention. I have had other modems fried from lighting and am confident this will not happen with my Zoom modem."
1,Nothing but nightmares,"This product is not for the faint of heart.If you like to spend long hours trying to make things work ,then this is the one.I bought it tried it and returned it.It just would not work right on my PC.(Win95 OSR2)I had to reboot 5 or 6 times everytimes to get my system to boot-up.It gave me .Registry errors,blue screens,missing files(DLL),even tried the newer driver from Zoom,but it crashed my PC.I reformated C: twice.I really tried hard but my system just chocked on it.Once in a while it would work and it was pretty good but that never lasted long.I went back to my Telepath for windows(28K) and upgraded it to V90 56k with one easy download."
4,A good look at a gentry woman's life,"This is a great starter book for those who are interested in a medieval gentrywoman's life.Ffiona Swabey is an interesting writer who gives us a general idea of Alice de Bryne's life, and consequently any gentry woman's life in general. It was interesting to see that although Alice was considered gentry, not aristocracy, and therefore lower on the wealth scale, this woman still had numerous estates, four personal chaplains, dozens of servants and hundreds of peasants working under her."
3,Sex-Bomb Niteclub Vocals!,"The liner notes of Pat's second LP ""Standing Pat"" states that if Anita Ekberg, Marilyn Monroe or Brigitte Bardot could sing like Billie Holiday, they'd be Pat Morrissey. Well, I dunno about that, but this is a kitschy disc with some torchy moments. This is like if Barbara Nichols wanted to be a jazz chanteuse! Sometimes Chicago's Miss Morrissey gets a little soulful on tunes like ""Shadow Woman"", but there's something of a whiny chorus-girl delivery on most tunes -- kind of like the gangster's girlfriend who wanted to be a nightclub singer.Bottom line: High camp for the Songbirds set."
5,"IF YOU CAN'T TEACH, BLAB","It's ironic that those that cannot understand the nature of teaching and The Teaching are the ones who are self-proclaimed ""experts"" in style and techniques of esoteric teaching.Make no mistake that EJ Gold is the genuine article, or rather I should say ""beware"" to those who are not and encounter the likes of a real teacher.When asked by his distinguised and learned visitors, why he instructed his students to throw mud on their coats, the great Sufi Sheikh replied, ""If you want respect, than anyone who wants something ""from"" you will provide it, all I offer here is knowledge.""So maybe Mr. Gold or some other teacher muddied the coat of these ""experts""... but then again maybe they just want respect.This book is not a replacement or substitute for a teacher, which I believe is a necessary relationship, but it is a book of information that someone can use on the spiritual journey.""Sell your cleverness and buy bewilderment""Rumi"
3,Not what I expected....,"The parrot food is deceiving, it presents well in the picture, it is okay. I expected more almonds and peanuts but should have known better. The price was too good for the parrot food to truly be packed with nuts. I have counted 5 almonds and and 15 peanuts. I won't order again. If you are ordering for the nuts look elsewhere."
5,A lively coverage,"This biography recalls early American radicalism and the efforts of one Mary Jones, a force in the early labor movement. She traveled throughout the country lobbying for civil rights, labor laws and basic worker's rights: her career, life, and long-ranging effects on American labor are recounted in a lively coverage."
3,Dry but informative,"Mother Jones was a character of mythic proportions, created by the all-too-human Mary Harris Jones. The author takes the position that while many of the details of her life - as portrayed in Mother's speeches, writings and autobiography - are impossible to verify or demonstrably false, they stood for a larger truth.Gorn obviously has sympathy for Jones and does a good job of putting her life in its context, but this book is no easy read. It is written in the dry verbiage and cadences of academia.An unequivocally positive addition to the library of labor history, but don't try to read it at night before bed unless your aim is to hasten sleep."
4,"Mother Jones, the Union Proponent...","Pretty sure I don't agree fully with her philosophy, but an interesting story of her life. I read this book for a school course, I probably wouldn't have gotten it otherwise."
4,Um dos melhores discos do ano. An excellent album.,"This is an excellent release from an outstanding group. Their strongest characteristic is their love for singing, and harmonies. Its very clear that these musicians love what they do and they're extremely good at it too..... E um disco que esta sempre a tocar na minha casa."
4,The US Navy in a realisitic book.,"I have to say that this book was good. I have never served onboard a ship, but Mr. Poyer paints a detailed picture of the life. The Med deals with Lt. Lenson, a young officer, and his life that occurs during short period of time. The terrorist plot was all too realistic.My only complaint is for the excessive use of swear words throughtout the book. ..."
2,So dainty and delicate! (lining ripped 2nd day),"These dainty and delicate gloves are a must have for anyone's Halloween wardrobe. But I don't recommend them for actual metal work. As crazy as it sounds, I use them for welding - hobby level at that - and the lining in mine ripped free when putting my hand in on the second day. The felt lining goes up to the wrist, where it was sewn to the leather shell, albeit poorly."
3,might be good for us graduates but not foreign graduates,"its a fair source of basic concepts, but lacks the true reflection of standard of difficulty of boards.if you are a foreign medical graduate and have time it's much better to use NMS BOARD SIMULATOR SERIES."
5,Superb!,"There may be a billion sports reporters after George Plimpton but there will never be a better one.Plimpton provides the best stories I have ever read about both Vince Lombardi and the Boston Celtics; all of his stories are written with a sound knowledge of sports that pulls no punches, but also with a literary flair that would at first seem to be a mismatch for such topics.One regrettable mistake ... I don't know if made by George himself or his publisher ... but twice on the same page is misspelled the name Mel Stottlemyre, a real shame given that, in the long dynasty of the Old Yankees ending in 1964, Stottlemyre was the very last of its heroes."
1,Dont watch this,"if you have academic knowledge about socities the video is BS!!,the author does not cover / know reality, all existing cults, economics and acutal issues.It is an individual's video, it a waste of time I will ask for refund."
2,worst ever,"This was and I do not hesitate in saying the most boring ,uniformative film I ever wasted time (and I waste alot of time )on ,I wouldn't waste another nickel on this guys' movies"
1,worst ever is right,"I have watched a lot of free videos better than this one. no new info, bad presentation, superficial info. Could finish watching this one either. Don't waste your money, will not learn anything."
3,Pretty interesting,"I found this to be interesting, informative, & entertaining. He covers a lot of different secret societies, & he makes you think! The world of fiction is not far from fact..."
4,Replacing old unit,"Had this alarm originally installed in new home, so did not have receipt from it for proof of purchase. Just purchased this one to replace the broken one. Original would just beep at all hours, even w/ new battery - and no carbon monoxide present. Installed new one and works great."
5,replacement CO detector,After looking from store to store this hard wired Carbon Monoxide detector is the best value i could find. Easy to install and looks just like the other units in the house.
3,CO Alarm,It seems to be a very well-made product. I'm assuming it would work well. It was a little hard to fit on it's bracket because the insulation overlapped the grooves.
5,BRK Carbon Monoxide detector,This product was exactly as advertised and arrived quickly. It was a replacement item for a unit that was installed when the house was built and for ease of replacement it needed to be an exact match.
1,All Defective,"I moved into a new house that had been built about a year before. For the past 17 months I have been changing batteries very often in my three CO detectors. I finally started putting dates on the batteries and found that they only last 2 months (1 month in a cold basement). I'm guessing I spent about $70 in batteries. The batteries are only there to kick in when the AC power fails, which it rarely does and never for very long. However, my tests indicate that the batteries are being drained while the AC power is properly working.I contacted the company for warranty replacements and was told I would have to pay $20 for shipping & HANDLING to get my ""FREE"" warranty replacements. I made a big stink and got them to send them at their expense. Only time will tell if the replacements work. Till then I can work on the problem of random beeps from my BRK smoke detectors."
1,JUNK,I purchased this to replace one that I had and went defective the so called life of the unit lasted 5 years and went bad not from carbonmonixide or from having a bad battery in it. It started to beep 2 beeps every morning about every 5 or 10 minutes for about 30 minutes. I replaced it and the New unit won't even stay attached to the mounting bracket that came with it. I tried the old bracket and it still kept poping off. I called there customer service office and guess what there going to send me another bracket I have news for them it's not the bracket it's there cheap/crapy mounting latches they have on the unit. Looks like I'll be playing the lets swap items until we figure out that what we sell is junk game. Buy anything but this unit unless you just enjoy putting up with crap.
3,Heavy Gere - 3.5 Stars,"This is one of Richard Gere's strongest performances - thanks to taut direction from Andrew Lau. Gere melds himself convincingly into the role of a man haunted by his past, the onerous aspects of his job, and the sexual offenders that he polices - aka his ""flock"". His character Errol Babbage finds himself in a very dark place - far darker than where Gere has gone before, as I recall him in roles like Internal Affairs. This film reminds me of ""Seven"" with Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt, but is more disturbing in many ways. Intense viewing and probably not for the faint of heart or those who expecting a comfortable feel good film or Richard Gere as eye candy...Claire Dane delivers a consistent performance as the protege stepping into uncomfortable shoes. They could've dialed it up even higher and avoided a Hollywood ending, but it's pretty gritty as it is. I give Gere's performance 4.5 stars."
3,let's not over-hype,"My main gripe is that this paperback is shoddy and the pages come apart after a coupleof reads.Otherwise, fun, typical collegetown artwork by pampered kidz who never heard of Iraq.The photos try to shock us with underground daring, but in reality, the antics are frat rat.Still, the artwork is energetic and there are fairly fresh design elements.I think that this book would be useful to red state artists who want to see what the coolpeople are up to."
3,Doesn't fit all wrenches,A lot of wrenches have a raised section in the middle where the brand name and size identification is located and this can cause issues especially for the smaller wrenches. All in all it works well.
2,Wrench holder looked used...,One of the pieces that I received looked used. It had large/deep scratches on the underside - must have been a returned item. I'm surprised it would be shipped to someone in that condition. I don't believe it was damaged in transit since the packaging (including the plastic bag) were all intact.
5,Jega kicks asphalt!,"Jega: Spectrum is the best. I'm so happy of my homecountry. ""Deutschlanders"" especially should check this techno out! I feel like I'm home again...By the way AFS rocks!"
2,"superficial, but helpful if you're just starting","This is NOT a comprehensive guide. If anything, it is a good outline of the issues you will come across. But do not consider this your single source for answers to the countless questions that will come up in setting up and running your small business."
2,Disappointing,I had some pretty high expectations for this book and it came nowhere near delivering. There are a lot of better books on the market that explain how to start a business.
5,A MUST for PC owners,"I was a novice user until I read this ""Bible"". Mr. Levin makes it sooo easy to understand. I loaned the book out, so I am back to get another to have at my side."
1,Not worth ten bucks,"Maybe I am desensitized to the supernatural, but this book was slow and ridiculousness. Seriously, you were scared??? There was only one original scene that was given away with foreshadowing."
1,Only a Hell House if your fear is dying of boredom,"I don't read much horror fiction, so I was expecting this book to be interesting, with a lot of suspense and gore, but it was so boring I would have returned it if I could (I bought the Kindle version). The most interesting bits were in the last 10%, like, the last 5 pages. The rest read more like a little kid's idea of ""scary"" pornography. Seriously. ""Oh my god, maybe she's a lusty lesbian in denial!"" Oooo, scary. Which, I must say - if you are disturbed by sexual violence, this book might likely bother you.It seemed like he meant it to have a psychological ""fear of the true self"" element but it was soooo shallow it was truly comical. And there's more interesting attempts at scientific phenomena in Pullman's His Dark Materials. MAYBE if I believed in ghosts I would have been more entertained, but I seriously doubt it. It maybe would work better as a graphic novel. A total yawn."
4,A classic horror tale,"This book has it all: A haunted house, a group of people who wish to dispel the evil that resides in it and a sinister presence behind the haunting. The reader turns the pages captivated by the story, as the facts around the evil presence unfold. However, if you have read MANY horror stories, as I have, you may find the ending a bit disappointing..."
4,Could Have Been Brilliant,"Though I think this book failed to live up to its potential, I still believe it to be one of the three truly great haunted house novels out there. Shirley Jackson's _The_Haunting_of_Hill_House_ ranks at the top of that list, with Stephen King's _The_Shining_ close on its heels. Matheson's _Hell_House_ rounds out the top three. The parapsychology gets a bit hokey, and the characters aren't quite as well-rounded as I'd like, but I was impressed with this novel overall. Some readers are also going to be offended by sexuality and a depiction of a satanic chapel, although I have to say I didn't consider either to be gratuitous in any way. As several other reviewers have mentioned, it doesn't quite compare with Matheson's masterpiece _I_Am_Legend_, but it is an intelligent, well-written, incredibly fast-moving haunted house novel. If you like haunted house novels or if you're a fan of Matheson's other work, you won't be disappointed with this one."
3,Pretty Good novel..... Just in time for Halloween.,"If you can discard the ""suspension of Belief"" in this novel, namely that the house just suddenly became ""haunted"" and no one wanted to be around it, plus a lack of horroristic background info on the main characters, it works smoothly. Putting those problems aside, and just reading it simply to put me in a frame of mind for the season, it became a book well worth reading. It overcame it's shortcomings with a well thoughtout ending. But it is not on my list of conversation pieces or mentionables."
2,An over-rated read,"I read this book hoping to be scared and amused. Unfortunately, I was amused, but for all the wrong reasons. This book is a collection of flat characters, and cliches which actually had me rolling my eyes at certain parts. The ending, which i will not disclose for those who haven't read ""Hell House"", was too convinient and neatly packaged, as well as ridiculous. I recommend ""I am Ledgend"" to readers who will better appreciate a scientific explanation of the supernatural that is suspenseful as well as entertaining."
2,So many typos,The story itself is great. The characters are interesting and the atmosphere is spooky. But this is ruined for me by all the typos. There are many cases of random punctuation and odd misspellings such Fie instead of He. There are typos on about every fourth page or so.
2,Decent book....Terrible proofreading in Kindle Edition,"This book filled my need for a nice horror story while on vacation. Not terrific, not highly original, but a decent version of the Haunted House genre. My biggest complaint was the terribly inadequate proof reading in the Kindle version. It appears to have been scanned and converted with OCR software with only a cursory proof read. ""He"" often shows up as ""Fie"", exclamation points appear as ! or ] and places in the scanned text that were hyphenated at ends of lines keep the hyphen. I'm guessing these showed up roughly every 5 pages (on my settings), more often in certain sections. If this sort of sloppiness bothers you, stay away.Hopefully, they can fix these errors and let us who bought the flawed version update....but I'm not holding my breath!"
5,Great Horror Novel,"This is without a doubt one of my favorite horror novels. I highly recommend this book. Richard Matheson is a phenomenal writer and created many great novels many you will probably recognize. This is easily one of the best ghost stories of all time. This novel has impressive writing, great development, and very believable characters; just a good book and a scary read."
4,Do you believe?,"a mystical murder caused by a demented spiritual entity of demonic means. Yet, a love story or better a kindled spirit romance."
3,Interesting but not really scary,"I didn't find this book to be particularly scary or creepy. I did find it interesting in how the scientist thinks he has figured out the ghost phenomena and goes on to prove(?) his findings, although the ending with the ""special"" room (can't spell it out here or I give away too much) was very silly... one of those ""yeah, right"" moments. Also, I thought the sceance scene was overdone with the ectoplasm. Another ""yeah, right"" moment. The main ghost character was very disturbing. Hearing the history of the house made you get a real sense of the deprevity and vileness involved. Overall, interesting concepts put forth regarding ghosts, but nothing really scary or shocking."
4,Very good Story,"This story is good. but very confusing, too much details, and too many things going on at once. i didn't 'feel' for any of the characters. and this haunted house, wasn't very scary. it had such potential, but was all over the place, and the ending was extremely disappointing, after such a biulding up of expectation. don't get me wrong this is a great book, but pales in comparison to ""I Am Legend"" Richard Matheson's, anyone's best work. READ THIS BOOK!"
4,Awesome haunted house story,"I first was introduced to Matheson's work by the novella ""I Am Legend"", which I loved. I got this book from the local library and it kept me up for two nights. Matheson's a skilled storyteller and he never lets up on the action, even during smaller passages that he uses for character development. I can see why Stephen King calls him a great influence. I'd place Matheson on equal footing with HP Lovecraft any day."
3,Ending disappointed,"I love subtle horror. I've never been one for blood and gore shock flicks, I was always into the horror stories that were creepy but not over the top. Give me something believable. My love for that type of horror definitely influenced my purchase of Hell House. I hadnt read his earlier work, but I did see Stir of Echoes and What Dreams May Come, and I figured how bad could it be. The awnser was not bad at all. The story moved at a good pace and the characters were better than average horror fare, but the ending seemed rushed and ultimately disappointing. After reading it, I could only say it was decent, and I'm still searching for a horror novel to truly scare me."
2,A poor imitation of Hill House,"Richard Matheson is undoubtedly one of the greatest writers of the horror genre, but this novel goes no further than being a very feeble imitation of Shirley Jackson' ""Haunting of the Hill House"". The characters are shallow, the setting is too exagerrated, and the climax is really, really poor. If you are a fan of haunted house novels, then Hell House may interest you, but I'd definitely suggest other books of haunting than this loss of time. Try Jackson's masterpiece, Marasco's ""Burnt Offerings"" or King's ""Shining"", they all are far better than this."
2,Not very good...,"I felt this story was really lacking. The characters were really shallow. It relied too heavily on the shock value of the profane of religion and sexuality. I didn't find it scary at all. If you want to read a truly scary haunted house story stick with early Stephen King, ""The Shining"" or even the more recent ""Bag of Bones"" which really spooked me out."
3,"It shows its age, it's dated.","It is really a nice book. I can't wait to finish it. However, it's like a B movie -- it has been done before, done again and again. I don't seem to be fair: because this book was published in 1971, whichever came after it was, let's say, ""not as original""; but, if you already read similar books, why bother any more?"
2,"Average book, lots of typos, not that scary.","I read the reviews on this book and was excited because it got such good reviews, some even going as far as saying it was the best haunted house book out there. I was disappointed. The kindle edition has typos everywhere which is frustrating.. as for horrifying, it was not. It was just an average book with a boring ending that left me frustrated I had wasted the time reading it.."
4,"Great Writer, Great Story","Ive read a few of Mathesons books before this one and I loved each one of them. I knoew a little of the story line before reading it, I mean, its just your basic haunted house book. It was more than that I found. It was very well written, very spooky and weird at times, and even a little erotic. The ending was surprising, and I thougt it was a great read. Not the best Matheson book Ive read, and Im sure its not the best hauted house book ever written, but its totally worth checking out!"
3,Intriguing but not terrifying,I definitely was never really spooked even in the dark. It was an interesting read but not nearly as scary as reviews made it sound. Really just eh. Not sure what the fuss is about.
4,This book takes you on a ride,Hell house was unequivocally one of the best haunted house books I have read. It reads like modern fiction and goes through its paces seamlessly. disturbing and at times explicit it is hard to put down.
3,"An amusing, page turning farce","It was worth the cost of the book. I bought ""I am Legend"" at the same time and read that one first, so ""Hell House"" was a disappointment by comparison. The characters were a little too much like common archetypes. Some of the supernatural occurences were actually ludicrous rather than scary. With a title like ""Hell House"" the author seems to already be fighting an uphill battle to live up to that. In spite of its shortcomings I was still wanting to know what happend next. The lesbian activities gave it an extra star for my review. Richard Matheson is a master storyteller and this book keeps you going. A decent work of fiction, far from a masterpiece."
3,Pretty Good Read,"It was a very good book. I liked this book, but then I read ""Flesh Gothic"" by Edward Lee. That book by Lee was way more fun covering the same basic premise. Neither book is for the squeemish or easily offended."
3,Not the best scary story out there,"I was torn on this book. The atmosphere of the house and the things happening kept giving me goosebumps but when it came down to the characters interacting, I would cringe every time. Out of the 4 characters in the house, 3 got on my nerves. Only Fisher was tolerable for me. Most of the scary scenes were scary enough but some just didn't do anything for me. Then near the end the incident with the hand and Edith (if you read it you'll know what I mean) actually had me laughing. I pretty sure I wasn't supposed to find it amusing. It was still a good read. I was hoping for so much more though."
4,An above average horror read.,"Matheson does a great job of creating suspense from the first paragraph to the ending climax. I thought I knew what was going on untill the very last chapter and I was totally shocked at how the story ended. The lush descriptions transported all of my senses to the fog shrouded Hell House property. It usually takes me at least a month to read an averge sized novel (approx. 300 pages), it only took me three days to finish Hell House. I loved this story."
5,One of the best Ghost Stories I have ever read,"Hell House is a very scary novel no doubt. But the real thing that makes it work is the amount of detail the author put into it. Richard Matheson really went out and did a lot of research on the subject of haunted houses. There is really onl one downside to this book and that is the fact that the Ghost is actaully the most interesting character. Maybe it isn't a downside, but you would think that the protagonist would be the most interesting character.Despite that minor flaw, the book still deserves the five star rating that I and many others have given it."
5,The Best!,"This is probably the best haunted house novel ever. Richard Matheson is the second most important horror-writer of the twentieth century, and this is my favorite novel by him. On the surface, it bears many similarities to The Haunting of Hill House: four paranormal investigators, a lesbian relationship, etc. This novel however is much grittier and the scare factor is greatly increased. For me, the most interesting part of the book is the backstory about Victor Belasco and how Hell House earned its name..."
4,A Good Classic to Keep on Your Bookshelf,"I didn't care for the characters too much, except for the psychic who lived to tell about his experience. The rest I thought were cliches of the 50s. The story and its premise, I thought, were great and the way he describes the horrific scenes is brilliant. The ending was surprising in its simplicity."
2,YAWWWWWNNN!!,"I had high hopes for this book after reading the reviews. However, i found this book slow and boring. No chills, no feeling except boredom? He could have made this the best haunted house story ever, and it fell flat. Heres this creepy mansion w/no windows and a creepy chapel and nothing ever happened. He blew and awesome oppertunity. I was not happy at all."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS EBOOK!!!,"I purchased this book in ebook format. The formatting was so terrible that it was unreadable. It was obvious that the publisher scanned a hard copy and no human ever looked at the output. If you are buying this for your Kindle, DON'T. The publisher clearly doesn't care about ereaders. Save your money. The ebook is unreadable. DON'T BUY IT!!"
2,It's not Shirley Jackson,"Loosely based on The Haunting of Hill House, this book was chilling but read more like a movie script for yet another remake of The Haunting (1963) starring Julie Harris and Clair Bloom. This still ranks as one of the scariest movies ever made yet never shows any gore or monsters. Skip this book and get the Shirley Jackson version. You'll be glad you did."
2,Not really scary.,"This was an OK book. I read so many reviews that placed it as a top scary book, but I don't think it would even make my top 20. I was highly disappointed."
5,"Like Hill House, less subtle and more daring","Its hard to say which novel I enjoy more between this one and Hill House. Both are great in their own ways. When I am in the mood for a more subtle ghost story, I like Hill House. When I am in the mood for a much more intensely exciting ghost story, I choose this one. A lot of people, including me, see glaring similarities between the two novels in their setup, but it should be clear that this only diminishes the overall effects in the purists on either side. Both novels are tremendous and classics. If I had to pick one I enjoyed more, I would honestly say this one. Matheson takes on the haunted house with a full frontal assault and never relents. I think I am in the minority here, but I prefer Hell House over Hill House."
3,Let's not blow this out of proportion,"Ok, let's get something straight, it is a good book, probably a great book, very intriging, but not as scary as everyone is making it seem. I read this book because I had read What Dreams May Come, and I looked up Matheson on Amazon.com. I found this and how everyone said how terrifying Hell House was, so i checked it out at the library. It was a neat book, i liked it, but it did not have me ""looking under my bed or in my closets"""
3,Hell House ??,"This book always seems to get high praises in the Horror Genre lists, but I found it just OK. It is not that the story is bad, but the concepts and mechanisms used in the book seem a little dated, probably thanks to all of the horror movies and books that have been written since. I have read and enjoyed other Matheson books, like ""A Stir of Echoes"" and ""I am Legend"" much more."
3,An average read,"I read this about a month ago after wanting to read it for a while. I did read some of the reviews before I brought, but I mostly read the 4 & 5 star reviews. So I kinda had high hopes for the book. Well, I discovered that the book wasn't the greatest or the worst. It's just average. I wasn't scared, a bit disturbed at times, but not scared. The book does limp thru to the end, with a half hearted ending. I was entertained with this book, so I don't have any major complaints about it. Other than it could've been scarier!"
3,Great ghost story however too many typos!,Great book however Kiindle edition has was too many typos! Sometimes four per page! Editors take note! Shameful! Ruined the read for me.
4,Good Scary Story,"I haven't felt really scared reading a horror novel in a long time, but this one did scare me. And this isn't a new book, but I just read it for the first time. Lots of action and horrible things happening kept the spookiness factor going. If you like haunted house stories, this is one of the best."
3,"A fine haunted house story, if you haven't seen the movie","""Hell House"" is a fine haunted house novel, written in a quick prose that reads like a movie script. And that is the problem: if you have seem the movie, it totally spoils the book. The novel has little more to offer besides a couple of sexually oriented scenes and a more violent climax (which I guess would have raised excessively the budget for the movie...). In my opinion, there really is no literary quality which justifies buying the book if you have already seen the movie. If you haven't, and if you like a competently crafted ghost story, go ahead. You'll like it."
5,One of the best books I've ever read,"Hell House is definitely the best haunted house novel I've ever read (followed closely by The Shining which was inspired by Hell House). The text is easy to read, but also rich with detail. I've seen some of the reviews saying the ending was predictable and the occurances are cliche, but you have to remember that when Matheson wrote this, it was pretty original. Matheson was a pioneer of 20th century horror writing, and this is one of his masterpieces.Yes, the book is disturbingly haunting, not cheap ""BOO"" thrills. You will look over your shoulder for a while after reading it. Also, check out the film, The Legend of Hell House. The parts that are in it are just like the book right down to the dialogue in most parts. But since it was filmed in the late 70's, they couldn't film certain parts due to content or budget. Still a great film."
3,Not up to the hype.,"Here is the best haunted house story ever told, according to Stephen King. It is the first I have read, so I agree. That said though, these characters are kind of annoying, and I found myself rooting for the house.I think the author sets a mood here, he builds a myth, but he ultimately fails to deliver a story worthy of that myth.I have to see the movie now, but it doesn’t look good…"
4,Creepy place,"This is a great episode-if there are such things as hauntings, this is the place.The first time TAPS visited this hotel crazy stuff happend- glasses of water smashed, closet doors opened & closed while they slept- they actually caught this all on tape. More crazy stuff happend during their 2nd visit, the live episode. There were creepy voices, pianos playing (us viewers could actually hear these things.) There wasn't just the usual ""cold spots"" that conveniently no-one at home can feel.This is a cool episode, pretty entertaining. Would recommend it."
5,GHOSTHUNTERS LIVE FROM STANLEY HOTEL,AWESOME SHAPE. DEFINITELY WORTH THE MONEY. A MUST SEE. GHOSTHUNTERS IS MY FAVORITE SHOW AND THIS DVD IS WORTH IT.
5,Hope the CD has more of this style music...wonderful !!,"Country Rock Boogie...the best fresh music I've heard in some time. A single does not a CD make, but what a good start this is!"
1,What a PATHETIC LOSER!!!,"Look at me ....I'm a tough guy ....just ask that dead tame bear over there. Gentry is so phoney he could be in the Bush administration. Let's make him co-Sec. of Defense! Rumsfeld-Gentry! Yeah, we'd limit our targets to unarmed people but the numbers would be great!What a PATHETIC LOSER!!!"
1,Not Grease-able,Manufacture promised that it would be grease-able. The long end is not drilled and comes with no zerk fitting. This was a serious waste of my time.
3,"Mostly cheesecake, but still some nice poses","Many of the same types of poses that you'll find in figure pose books or lingerie magazine specials, but the models and photography are better than average. Perhaps worth considering by other artists or photographers looking for inspiration, but there are better products available for figure artists (see my other reviews)."
5,Very well made.,"Very well made product. Very roomy, to hold your tarot cards, runes or whatever you like."
5,It's THE book !,"On a very complete way, once more, Chaitow shows on Positional Release Techiniques important ways to restablish functional state of different structure, such as muscle spasm, enhacing circulation and more. A very fine book that will be usefull for many manual trehapists. If you have any doubt, don't wait more, acquire it !"
5,Intriguing,"I was hesitaing to buy it because I had never heard of Samia before, however this album was a pleasant surprise. Farah's voice reminds me of Edie Brickel, ""in French."" The music is smooth and mellow, yet has some B. B. King presence in it."
3,Poorly mixed,"The playing is solid enough, but the piano is somehow mixed lower than the bassand drums, and let's face it, you buy this for the piano. If you're on yourfirst 1 or 2 Hank purchase, look through some of the others. My faves so farare the one with Donald Byrd and Steal Away with Haden."
4,Excellent introduction for the amateur enthusiast,"I visited Barcelona this summer on a day trip from our family holiday in Costa Dorada. I was drawn mainly by the opportunity to see first hand the amazing works of art by Antoni Gaudi which I had heard about since childhood. I was not disappointed and my wife and kids loved it too. I just didn't have enough time to see everything I wanted to, so when I came home I wanted to buy a book with great photos and a bit of explanation for the layman. This book certainly does that although as a layman I don't know what serious students of architecture would make of it"
2,Not what is pictured,"I'm disappointed that the cutter I received was not what was pictured. It is a holly leaf with a stem, but no berries. It seems to be a typical cutter otherwise."
2,Nice while it lasted,"I really enjoyed using my MP3 player. It had good functionality, and I used it a lot. When it fails, good luck finding a support site or phone number. The manual is pretty useless, also. After two months of pretty heavy usage, the battery lost its life. With no hope of fixing it or replacing the battery, it went into the garbage."
4,I liked it,"I liked it a lot.... I just think that this product is more fragile than the ipod by apple, but I paid less, so it`s worth it. The FM works good, the sound is good, so...you can buy too"
1,Awful Garbage,"I bought this item a couple years ago. It is awful garbage. Did not work at all. It turned on but would do nothing. The instructions appeared to be a literal translation of korean.I instead upped my budget and bought an Insignia NS-dv2g and loved it so much I went back and bought the 4GB version. Best player ever, a definite ipod killer!you've been warned, stay away from the ninio."
2,for the price,the tag on the back of the product says 2gb but when you connect to the computer it says only 1gb. it works but i would say the picture is prettier than the actual...
3,Good but not Great,"OK, I bought this unit like most people knowing that it is not an Ipod Nano and for the price would probably not perform like one. Correct. Though it is a huge improvement over my last player which was a 256mb Rio as far as storage goes, I am not that impressed with the other features. I have yet to figure out the video conversion software and probably will not bother because the best battery life I have experienced after 2 months of use is 2.5 hours. Must have got a knock-off of a knock-off? I do disagree with other posters who said it is flimsy. I stepped on mine and although the glass (not plastic) screen cracked open, it still works 'perfectly'."
1,Don't waste your money,The manual sucks. The player isn't worth more than 5 bucks. Remember!!! you get what you pay for! It doesn't even deserve 1 star.
4,good but not great,"preety good low batery life and not easy to use but makes up in price and video play back,better the ipod nano.i got mine in only 3 days. the head phones are smaller then regular ones though.ipod easy to use ,this notthis cheap, ipod nano notthis has video,ipod doesntbuy this"
1,Nano Fakes are a rip off,"Don't waste your money on this junk. First, its ugly and doesn't look half as good as the ipod nano. Second, the video format that it plays is only .AMV. This is a very very very rare format and you will need to download a converter to go from .avi to .amv. Good luck; its a pain to use. Also, the controls are a nightmare and the quality of the product is very questionable in your hands. The battery life on a full charge is no better than 6 hours.The biggest nuisance is getting to your music. You can scroll one song at a time which takes too long (as it is it takes a few seconds to go from one song to the next). The easier way is to make subfolders. I made mine by artist. I'm not going to explain the complicated process of using subfolders... but its no walk in the park.My advice to you: Don't buy these cheap ripoffs. You're better off buying something else."
3,?????,i cant decide whether to by this item over the nano. could someone please tell me if the ninio compacto has a touch screen like the nano because if it does that would make my decision alot easier
3,Graphic SF Reader,"Rising Stars: Visitations tells the story of some of the Specials when they were younger. So, this fills in some of the background of the characters that you see in the main series, and is not at all necessary for your enjoyment of the rest of it. You can pretty much guess who, of course. Probably for completist types only."
2,Not a Clearly Stated Case,"There is a lot of good Biblical information here on the ministry of Deacons, but the author's case is not clearly stated. As I understand it, he is attempting to define this ministry role not as a position of leadership, but a position of service and mercy. This book would serve as a good reference work on the Biblical basis of the Deacon, but I would not recommend it as something to offer to a newly-ordained Deacon. There are other titles on the market that are much more streamlined and easy to follow than this one."
4,"stunning ""lisa"" gives real love","I think ""LISA"" is absolutely sensational looking in this video. Almost all the songs are sweet and easy to listen too! I enjoyed it very much indeed."
4,Good product but expensive shipping,I sent these as a gift to Vancouver. The shipping was expensive and a little slow however they got there fine. I would recommend getting them if they lowered the shipping costs.
3,Skirt,"The skirt is really tight. And the stockings are extremely long. The colors are very bright though, and the hearts are velvety, which I love. A good product, but not for someone of average height who has large thighs."
4,Much Happier,"I wrote a review previous to this claiming to be a little disappointed. Well, Now I am elated! I sent the product back and they replaced it at no charge! I haven't experienced any more problems. Apparently it just had a flaw in that particular item. I recommend this product."
4,RED (TRU MOTHA *******! SOLDIER) MIAMI,"FAITH EVANS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE SINGERS, HOWEVER THE FIRST ALBUM WAS BETTER THAN THE SECOND ONE. BUT I'LL GIVE HER CREDIT FOR NOT ONLY BEING A GOOD MOTHER BUT ALSO A GREAT SINGER. SO GIRL DO YO THING!"
2,Disappointing,"I've installed 2 of these in bathrooms, but they consistently turn off too quickly if they haven't been on in a while. Adjusting the timer will lengthen the amount of time it's on once it's warmed up, but it still has the problem the first time it turns on. It's gotten to the point where many people just turn the switch to on so they don't get plunged into darkness, defeating the purpose of the things.I'm looking for another brand to replace these with."
1,Light stays on,"Connected switch but when the light times out, the light bulbs stay dimly lite. When motion is sensed, the lights brighten up, but again, when timed out, the lights stay dimly lite. Unit is wired correctly as per manual. A ceiling fixture with two incandescent bulbs is being used."
1,Poor quality motion sensor switch,"One out of 8 that I bought worked! Poor quality! In the future, I would rather pay a little more for a better quality motion sensor switch."
5,mrrtyle Bonsai,"Interesting plant , blooming nicely outside. I wonder what it will be indoors in the winter"
1,not so much,"I had this tree sent to my daughter for her birthday, but it arrived in poor condition and only got worse. We fared no better with a second attempt...we were very disappointed, to say the least. But, Amazon was very cooperative about our return."
2,Crepe Myrtle,"So far, this Crepe Myrtle has not shown one flower, nor the potential for any flowers, and, in fact it did not look good when I got it, about 30 days ago. I will provide an update if it starts looking healthier and beautiful like the picture. Product did arrive quickly. Also, the greenery is not near as full as the picture shown."
1,Brussel's Crepe Myrtle Bonsai,This item arrived looking half dead with no leaves or blooms. I followed the instructions but the bonsai never had a chance. This was a total waste of money and unfortunately I bought two different bonsai's as gifts and they both did not live. I would NEVER recommend purchasing this product.
2,Brown Thumb?,"This is the second bonzai tree that I received and just like the 1st one, this one does not look like it's going to make it for very long. I thought maybe it was something I did or didn't do but regardless... No plant should be that difficult to maintain considering it started to look very dried out and droopy come day two. The soil was very hard & dry and packed way too tight into the pot that it made watering the plant nearly impossible."
2,1st attempt at bonsai,the dwarft crepe mrytle bonsai never flowered but did grow but left outside as specified in instructions it now has lost most leaves and probably will not make it thru the winter.
1,Brussel's Dwarf Crepe Myrtle Outdoor Bonsai Tree,"It doesn't look healthy when I got it, but I thought I should give it a chance. But now, all the leave are gone.I am not sure if it will show a sign of life or I just wasted my money.The other two bonsai are doing well. Still wondering why this flowering plant which looks so beautiful in the picture, might become a disappointment- I hope not...."
1,Brussel's Crepe Myrtle Bonsai,"Brussel's DT9049DCM Crepe Myrtle BonsaiI was totally disappointed with this product! Unfortunately, I didn't read the reviews before I ordered it, which taught me a lesson. The picture showed beautiful, purple flowers...when mine arrived, it barely had any leaves, let alone flowers! Also, the instructions that came with the ""plant"" said it was for outdoors, & there was nothing about that in the description. Amazon was wonderful about giving me a refund, but I think they probably had a lot of practice giving refunds for this one! I also learned not to order plants through the mail. I would not recomend this product."
1,So DISAPPOINING,"I ordered this Crepe Myrtle Bonsi for a very dear sister-in-law who just turned 70. She loves bonsai and I LOVED the photo and all the info I read on this particular bonsai. I knew she would love this new hobby and probably order more and more as well as share the idea of a new hobby with her friends. We live so f ar away from each other I wanted her to have something unusual to enjoy. The plant arrived with absolutely NOTHING on it not a leaf, or flower. What a sad plant, she sent a tx pik of it. She has hopes that it will somehow come around and turn into the lovely plant you pictured. My husband and I order very frequently from Amazon and for many years have just never had any complaint but this is just really a terrible HAPPY BIRTHDAY to a very sweet and dear lady."
2,Bonsai Tree,"The pot that the tree was in was broken, and I just did not have the time during the Christmas sesaon to try and return it and then have you send me another one."
5,silk painting designs- dover book rock!!,Fantastic. These books are the best I have found to find pictures to use as templets or stencils for designs to paint on silk.Dover books ar the best I've found for designs
4,Great Coloring Book,"I purchased this book for my 6th grader who homeschools. This is fun addition I added to his studies on bird anatomy and a bit of history of Audubon. It's nice for assignments and artwork, that is also enjoyable."
4,bought as a gift,"I think this is great for teaching children about the birds that might be in their own backyard, and maybe the can learn an appreciation for wildlife."
5,Darkly quirky Japanese comedy,"What a great film. Writer/director Juzo Itami takes on the Yakuza, who extort money through both physical intimidation and the threat of public humiliation. Itami himself was stabbed by a member of the uyoku, the Japanese right wing, which is affiliated with the Yakuza, shortly after this film was released. He must have touched a nerve.In this film, a posh hotel has been targeted by the gangsters. No longer able to support the outflow of cash paid to prevent the criminals from embarrassing the establishment, the management decides to take action. They are completely unprepared for the task. Finally, they turn to a plucky attorney played by the charming Nobuko Miyamoto, who teaches them how to use the law to their advantage. The real delight of this film is watching the various frightened hotelmen transform into an effective anti-extortion force."
5,YOU GOTTA LOVE THEM!!,"SFU is one of the best bands in this genre, I bought Warpath about 8 Years ago and to be honest I've been a fan ever since, and this boxset is just plain awsome, groups like this are out to please fans, maybe cause there are fewer of us but hey, groups like this are still around while other mainstream one hit wonders have long since turned to dust, maybe it's the talent....which is what this group is all about from riffs to songwriting, they're over the top!!"
5,Excellent Ballet,"I agree with the other reviewers that this is an excellent DVD of a very good ballet. The performance (dancing, music, choreography) is excellent."
5,Sylvia is my new favorite ballet!!,"I am SO glad that I purchased this DVD! I've been dancing for 25 years and teaching for 11 years and had never seen this ballet until this year. Boy am I glad I found it! Darcey Bussell is one of my favorite ballerinas and she is BRILLIANT and stunning in this ballet. The choreography is wonderful, the costumes are beautiful and the music is fresh and inspiring!! I think every dancer, teacher, student needs to have this in their ballet DVD library!! Buy it, you won't be disappointed!!!"
5,Excellent classical ballet production,"This is classical ballet at its best. First class dancing by all, particularly the lovely Darcey Bussell - I'm a fan of this beautiful dancer. The sets and costumes are great just as is the music. The extras relate that the choreography for this production, originally created by Frederick Ashton in the 1950's was nearly lost but was revived for this production. Some of the dancing is spectacular and is accompanied by the familiar Delibes music. I would only give it a rating of 4.5/5 for video as it is slightly on the soft side of Blu Ray capabilities but that is not a real distraction. The BD audio is fine and the extras are interesting and best viewed first.Overall recommended without reservation.John"
1,Emails from Mt. etna,"The first sentence in the third paragraph of the prologue sums up the content of this book. Poorly written, bland observations and plenty of inaccurate information.I've lived in Sicily for 8 years and the bugs aren't that bad."
4,Computer Espionage,Provides good background but must be considered with other cyber-literature to obtain a broad cyber-crime perspective.Not for the computer hardware/software technically challenged.
3,ALADDIN AND THE ADVENTURES OF ALL TIME!,"This ANIMATED FILM has nothing to do with the Disney movie or any of its direct-to-video sequels! But if you make the mistake of thinking that, the people at New Horizons will not mind! Here is the basic story: ALADDIN makes a new friend named PAIGE, who lives in the modern world! He takes her on his MAGIC CARPET for a RIDE THROUGH TIME! They get to meet Egyptian Queens, English Kings, Pirates and even Dinosaurs! Ed Gilbert and Jennifer Darling do the voices, so that might give you a good idea of what to expect! Think of this as ""Aladdin and Paige's Excellent Adventure""! This is a film that manages to be neither all that educational or all that entertaining!"
4,Ranks Among the Best Renditions,"For Mozart fans, this rendition of Die Zauberflote ranks up there as one of the best renditions of Mozart's classic opera. I highly recommend it. I never give anything five stars, by the way."
5,Music That Speaks For Itself,"This record brings melodies that will awaken your heart, music that will stimulate your soul, and lyrics that will sleepover in your mind. Too good to call best record of 1999... so far the best record of this lifetime. Inexplicably beautiful..."
3,nice,Nice describes this album perfectly. These songs are sweet and evoke perfect dreamy teenage memories. It reminds me of early Velocity Girl with those wispy boy/girl harmonies.
4,Gorgeous arrangements of timeless music!,"I just adore this recording and had to post this after reading the horrid review found here. It doesn't seem the person who wrote it is for real----he refers to the pianist as a MAN and it is obvious from the COVER of the album that Robin is a woman. Also, he says the arrangements are 'primarily' piano. They are ALL solo piano. I think this review is a spam of some sort. Anyway, if you like standards and showtunes, this is a beautifully executed album. My preference, however, is to Robin Spielberg's original pieces on her other recordings."
2,"THIS CD LOOKED LIKE A CAN'T MISS GEM, BUT.......",i have many solo piano cds and am always looking for more to add to my colletion. when i discovered this cd i thouhgt that it looked very interesting. when i bought it and played it a few times i thought this isn't going to work. the songs selected were well known songs for the most part but Robin did not add very good arrangements to these gems. i only liked 5 out of 14 tracks listed. what a shame to waste these beautiful songs on poor arrangemtns.
2,Someone slam the lid shut please!,Listening to these songs is like sitting in a hotel bar and listening to some really bad piano player destroy wonderful songs with truely tasteless vamping. Absolutely awful arrangements. Several of the songs were primarly piano solos and there was nothing wrong with the original arrangement but he couldn't leave well enough alone.
5,good time,really fun songs that bring back my childhood and fun memories to make and share with my children. thank you
1,Way underpowered,"Not near enough output to deter much of anything. Also you can save $20 by buying from Home Depot. I don't know what the joule rating is on this unit, but it must be pretty low (sub-1 joule)."
4,cute stuffie- my daughter loves it!,I went online to look for a cute purple bear and this was an amazing deal. She (my daughter) picked it out and takes it with her everywhere! Super fast shipping and I am very satisfied with this purchase.
3,Has some good messages but...,"I read the collection which contains Way of The Peaceful Warrior and Sacred Journey of the Peaceful Warrior in two weeks. I enjoyed both books, both contained inspirational messages blended with a compelling storyline. However, the author does a disservice by blending fact with fiction. Trying to pick out the actual wisdom of Socrates and Mama Chia from the metaphysical speculation was difficult. Life is confusing enough. On the whole, I would recommend Millman's books but read cautiously and don't abandon rationality for feel-good metaphysics. For an honest depiction of life and the nature of man, I would reccomend Krishnamurti's Freedom From the Known."
2,Worked well...when it work!,"Installation and configuration of this modem under Linux and Windows was a breeze. Performance was decent for a modem. However, the cable connecting to the modem easily slipped out disconnecting me from the Internet numerous times. Currently, the connection is not reliable at all. My connection breaks if the cable is moved just slightly. I purchased a D-Link modem/NIC from D-Link today. Farewell ZOOM!"
3,"Good modem, but a bit fragile","While this modem is excellent in its functioning; it lacks robustness in its construction. The connector to the cable is extremely easy to destroy, as I did with mine. If you buy this, treat it with kid golves and be ever so careful not to damage the socket where the cable plugs in."
5,Bold Film,"THis movie is outcold! Raw characters, raw acting. Jonathan West is awesome in this. Alot of low budget films miss the mark, but the acting from Jonathan is on point!!! Good job a must see. Highly recommend."
3,Movie Lovers & Friends,It is entertaining and has some good spots. Just a little over the top for me. This is the type of movie you probably watch only a couple of times.
2,leave it,This movie was very slow and difficult to get into. The quality of the film was very cheap and the actors were not very skilled.
2,Not the quality I expected by far,"I will just say from now on if it is not a mainstream producer, diretory, etc. I will not watch."
1,Save your money - Don't buy this!,"I just purchased over $300 of Elemis Cellutox Active Body Concentrate and Bath Detox. The bath was supposed to pull out the toxins. I bought this on a Norwegian Cruise this spring after a couple 50 min. sales talks and lots of hype about how it would pull out the toxins and a person would could expect to lose 15 lbs. I followed the directions religiously for 3 weeks and my bath water didn't turn brown, my skin didn't tighten, no weight loss. I took the 30 min. baths twice per week just like directed and nothing changed for me."
2,Expensive,No change in skin tone or appearance. Way to expensive. I even bought the dry brush to use with it.
1,it's a scam,"I bought this product during a cruise along with another Elemis lotion after having a 50 minute session of ionithermie to flatten my stomach. The girl at the spa expected me to buy over $2000 in products to continue the effects of the ionithermie. Don't waste your money. I wasted over $300 on a procedure and lotion. My arms, stomach, and thighs seem tighter, but I also workout, drink plenty of water, and massage the area as directed with the lotions."
4,"""...Faerie = Feral = Fear...""","I can't say enough about DeLint - book after book - I fall in love with his writing and characters and their experience with the natural world. The world that is becoming lost daily. This is listed as an early work - back in print. It feels less complete or as well-formed as more recent books; my perception. But nonetheless - his ability to give you an instant chill of loneliness and then wrap you back in the warmth of friends, love or home - and the peculiar way that DeLint makes my heart ache for a bit of magic... it's all here."
4,"Details, Details","Kennett's Secrets of the Couturiers feeds the soul with photos of beautiful fashions, then feeds the mind with descriptions of how to replicate many of the details that designers made famous. The book examines the careers of Worth, Poiret, Vionnet, Schiaparelli, Chanel, Dior, Balenciaga, McCardell, Courreges, Cardin, St. Laurent, and Valentino. Working on the bias, pockets and buttonholes, linings, rouleau, pockets, hems, fine fabrics and flowers are some of the secrets that are explained."
4,good documentary,"If you like western documentary's you should enjoy this one. filmed and narrated well, better than most movies of this type."
4,Very Romantic,"""First Time"" is aptly named. This 1992 release was Jackie's first Mandarin album and first with a Taiwanese record company instead of a Japanese one. This is also the first time his style has changed to become softer and very romantic. The song ""So Transparent is My Heart (Ming ming bai bai so de xin)"" was his biggest hit in Asia it is still very popular.The songs are:1. My Feeling - Soft and Romantic2. I wished The flower Could Never Fade - Romantic song3. The Reddish Face -4. Keep Your Company Through Every Moment5. So Transparent is My Heart - Worth the price of the album itself6. A Vigorous Aspiration in My Mind7. The Betel Nuts Beauty - enjoyable but not too romantic8. You are a Lover in My Dreams9. Everyday in My Life10. The End - Jackie talks in this track. It isn't a song.This album is definately worth your consideration and would be a wonderful addition to anyone's collection especially for Jackie Chan's fans."
2,"No noise as advertised, lots of dust","Installed a year ago on a Honda Element along with Brembo rotors. Quiet pads, but excessive brake dust; will be trading them out for ceramics."
3,Still Slade,"The addition of Slade's daughter co-authoring this book brought a freshness that was lacking in Burnt Bones. Still somewhat predictable and to form, but it does keep you guessing enough to want to read more. Hangman as a villian is much easier to relate to than some of the past over the top villians of other books. The great thing about Slade is that the good guys do take a beating. Still makes you wonder why anyone would work in Special X. Overall an enjoyable enough read."
1,Boring and Rambling,"I bought this because the cover looked good and murder books are my favorites. This was a major let down. I love murder books like Kiss The Girls and Along Came a Spider. I thought this would be a similar murder mystery, but this was just rambling garbage. I hope this is not typical of the author's work. I think this was the biggest waste I ever had. Enough said."
2,Hangman,OK who kidnapped Michael Slade? It surely isn't the same combination of people that wrote Headhunter! Hangman was trying to be the same but couldn't quite bring it off. I didn't feel as involved with these people and didn't even have a whole lot of sympathy for Zinc in this latest escapade. I've always felt very connected with all the characters in these books and loved the history and legends. This just wasn't the same. Maybe it was me!!!
3,GREAT book!!,"My first time reading this author. I bought this recently and decided on trying a different genre for a change. I NEVER guessed who the ""bad guy"" was until almost the end and I was really surprised (and disappointed) to find out who it was.The only negatives that I found were the technical jargon of describing how to do the noose, the ship's descriptions and the fact that the authors are Canadian, so there's a small language barrier in the translation between American English and Canadian English. Other than this, the book was great and well worth your effort to read it!"
4,Keeps you Hanging,"I was pleasantly surprised by this book. Hangman is about a murderer who kills all his victims by hanging them and dismembering them like the popular children's game. I thought the plot was terrific and the twists were well crafted. I think the idea for the book is very interesting. When I read it I felt like I was learning but I didn't mind being educated about the legal system. It was relevant to the plot. I did not give the book five stories because I wished the bad guy had been someone else. The reasoning behind the villian's murders was totally unusual and it didn't really add up. I was pleased with the rest of it though. This book isn't for the squemish, I should add."
4,Great story and writing; but questionable plot developments,"This was the usual tremendous Slade storyline and writing, even though I guess the team changed a bit(or was his daughter always the second member). The story grips the reader from the first sentence right to the end, and the historical detail always adds alot to these books. Additionally, the writing style itself is so much better than the usual horror novelists(including, for example, King and Koontz in my view). The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars, though, was that I think 2 things that happened in this book were, as plot devices, just plain inappropriate. I won't say what they are, because that would be a spoiler, but I think both could have been changed and the book still would have been great. Also, I have to say I like DeClerq and Craven better than Zinc, so their absence in this novel didn't help it in my eyes. Nonetheless, it's still an excellent book."
5,_ _ _ _ _ Guess in tomorrows Paper. Hangman Fan,"I have been following the folks at Special X since the Headhunter case. When Zinc Chandler came aboard to take on the Ghoul, I found a man of action that lived near the edge of the abyss. Slowly, Zinc has been taken apart piece by piece by the Psychos he has hunted. Now, once again, a piece of him has been removed. After reading these cases for so long, you feel it when one of the team falls. Will this be the end of Zinc? I doubt it; he seems to have more lives than a cat. Will he ever be the same? Never. This case flows as smooth as a waxed noose tightening around the neck. I flew through the clues in the file and although I guessed the identity of the Hangman, I didn't really know the answer to the final riddle of why. This ranks among the best of the Special X cases. I would hate to put them in order of preffrence, but this one is up there on the ladder with noose in place. Oh, and the answer from above--- G R E A T."
4,"A quick, but valuable, read","We live in an era of increasingly high expectations. When performance is consistently at high levels, it is natural for any slip up to appear much larger than it really is. The authors present a common sense approach aimed at reminding your customers of exactly how good a job you are doing -- a critical thing to do before the inevitable mistake occurs. While there is nothing earth shaking here, it will definitely make you take a look at where you stand in your customer's eyes, and how to get them to realize your true value as a vendor. Highly recommended."
5,Do Not Ever Be Invisible Again ! !,"Great insight into business & personal activities - you need to ""toot your own horn"", this tells you Where, When, How, & Why to take action so you (or your comapny) is not invisible. Remember Nolan Ryan well states it: ""It ain't bragging, if you can do it"".My Husband is making it a gift to each of his APICS Certification Class students."
4,Bienvenu,"Bienvenue dans la country-music féminine et qui, plus est, une des meilleures représentantes. Cette artiste est géniale et elle chante très bien. Superbes morceaux. A découvrir absolument."
5,Great! I can't get enough of this cd . . . . .,"I take this cd everywhere with me. I love the song with Big Sandy, Steal Crazy. Jeremy Wakefield and Dave Biller have such a exciting sound. What more can I say? I love it!!"
3,"technical prowess abounds, music selection is bland.","These guitarists have ability that is beyond approach, but the selection of music is lacking inspiration or creativity. Much of it sounds repetitive and after a few cuts, you too will be bored with it."
2,Not one of the better Marvel Legends figures,"Of all of the Marvel Legends figures, I think the Human Torch has fallen a bit short of the quality we have seen in the other figures. First off, the flames on the torches body do not really look that good. The flames on his head look like he has a big yellow-orange hairdo. Then there are the black lines that are painted all over his body. I realize in the comic these lines give his body some definition. However, it just makes the toy looks silly."
2,What a disappointment,"Toy Biz hit big with Spiderman Classics. They hit big with Marvel Legends. Here comes series two.Series two is not nearly as cool as series 1. Human torch, an awesome character, should be extremely cool in this series. It's not.HT barely stands on his own. Certainly wont stand up straight. It's nice to have detail, and all the points of articulation. However, does he REALLY need to have two places to bend in his torso? That gives way to his instability.I gave this toy a 5 star rating for education. It's sarcastic, because figuring out HOW to keep it standing, and display it, is a real education.I was highly disappointed in this figure. Inside the package, he looks cool. If you want to enjoy this figure, keep it inside the packaging.I give this figure a 2 1/2 star rating. 45 on a scale of 100."
4,fringe,The Chinese Fringe Flower produces beautiful pink fringed flower several times throughout the year. The Chinese Fringe Flower requires good indirect sunlight and is best suited for patios or areas in front of a large window that gets good light. The Fringe Flower likes watering conditions on the dry side. Watering should be done through the foliage and around the base of the plant. The Chinese Fringe Flower can withstand temperatures down to 32 degrees F.
1,Very disappointed,"I had planned to present this flowering bonsai to the doctors and hospital staff who preformed and cared for me during a major surgery. When it arrived it was a wilted, brown and broken mess. Totally unpresentable. It appeared to me and to my wife (a master gardener) that the plant possibly had been subjected to freezing temperatures along with some rough handling. With dead blooms and brownish tone (lacking the rich green in the leaves) its future is very uncertain. I have a digital image of the plant as it looked upon arrival before it was to be transfered to the hospital and is available if a way to send. This is certainly not the quality I have come to expect of an Amazon product. Richard Wilson, Ph.D."
2,Poor condition and underwelming,"My girlfriend purchased this for me for valentines day. The plant arrived in good health and was packeged with precision. That however is not my issue. The tree if you can call it that does not look like a ""bonsai"" at all really. It has a very thin trunk, poor root structure, no nabari, and poor branch development. I also could find no data on ""Fringe Flower"" in my 7 bonsai books that I own. I would advise purchasing a Chinese Elm or Black Pine. I would not recommend to a friend."
1,Not as described,Although the item came in on time and decent enough. This is an outside bonsai. This is not an inside bonsai. Very disappointed.
1,Tree died after 2 months,Was disappointed to find out that this tree that I purchased as a gift for someone has died after continuous care of 2-3 months.
2,Query on placing an order,"You have shown the person as the reciepient of my order as also the person for billing purposes this should not be so.The order will be and should be for my account and the billing ,please explainDennis Tickle"
1,HATED IT,"WHEN IT GOT TO MY HOME IT WAS FROZEN A FEW DAYS LATER IT DIED. I WAS VERY UPSET IT WAS A PRESENT ,I think they should send me my money back."
1,Died soon after arriving,All 3 of the bonsai tree's I purchased died within a couple weeks of being delivered. They looked bad when they arrived but I thought it was just from getting moved around in the box. They lost a lot of leaves the first couple days and then were completely dead within 2 weeks. IT was a huge disappointment as we spent a lot of money on these trees and now have nothing to show for it.
3,not styled or pre trained in any way......,"i m giving this item three stars because it arrived fast, was very healthy and in great condition when it arrived. that being said that was all that was right with it. i order a good amount of bonsai and was not expecting too much for the price. but i thought it would at least be somewhat styled or prepared to grow as a bonsai or at the very least would have only one or two trunks. i odered another bonsai from this same company along with this one and was extremely pleased with it but this one looked nothing like the picture and resembles more of a bush than a tree, it has six or seven trunks coming out of the dirt in the pot......i'm gonna have to put it in a regular pot or the ground and vigorously prune it for two years before it is down to a single or double trunk then it will be ready for a bonsai pot.......it does have beautiful leaves though and will be worth the work but not at all what i expected from the description and the picture...."
3,"Nice looking. Prossibly our fault, but it's dead already.","Nice looking when we received it. We tried to follow the watering, placement instructions, but it died after about 2 weeks."
2,Broken pot,"Hello,The bonsai pot was broken when it arrived, the bonsai was fine though. I like to get a replacement pot so I can place the bonsai in the right place.Thanks,Mana Weigand"
4,As Advertised,Great addition to an otherwise drab hitch receiver. We get a lot of smiles and waves from folks passing us on the highway
4,Finish the Job,It's hard to rate a product a fills a hole- it does that. I mistakingly assumed it uncluded a pin to hold it in place.
1,Poor Quality,"First time I got on the freeway, one of the blades snapped off from the wind... So, don't buy if you plan on going over 70!"
1,"Poor quality: Plastic, not metal",Product description says 'chrome' which implies metal. It is plastic. They should change their description; it is misleading. I had this for a couple of months before it broke.
2,Broke in the carwash,"This item was less than I expected. Out of the package, the shaft came in two pieces and had to be screwed together before using. This is probably the weakness that caused it to break the first time going through the carwash. An previous propeller (different brand) lasted many years (and many trips through the carwash). If you want a propeller, spend a little more to get a better one."
3,Propeller trailer hitch cover,"This product looks nice and was easy to install. The propeller spins as you drive, but it makes a very annoying sound that resonates throughout the entire vehicle. Lubrication doesn't seem to help. I still like the way it looks, so I ended up securing the propeller blade so it won't spin."
3,For the money it's OK,"I may go to the extreme of having a friend make one of the ""Real McCoy"" profile,all metal.Thank you for my purchase"
5,Hitch Cover,I accidentally broke off the last one at a drive through car wash so don't leave it on when going through one. This was a gift for my husband and he was happy with the quality.
4,Thumbs up!,"i bought this as a gift for my friend, when i asked if it met his expecations because Amazon wants to know, he said ""Oh yes!! I get a lot of Thumbs up on it as I Cruise down the highway..."""
5,Bravo of the Brazos,"I'm finding this one of the best books that I have read on the life of John Larn and his buddy John Selman. I have bought a number of the books that are out there dealing with their life and history. As I am doing family genealogy on John Selman and his wife Edna DeGraffenried, this book was very helpful. Just the new twist in John Larn's name was interesting to me. Was he John Larn, John Laurens, John Lawrence, with the name changes and which side of the law? In this book I have found a number of sources, truths, and new facts. It is also a great read, and the tie between a number of these families is well covered in this book."
5,wild west reader,"Five Stars for sure. A fantastic book on a little know person. I haven't really heard a lot about John Larn. If I did read something about him I don't remember because it was probably something small. I will remember him now. If you like the wild west at its best, cattle rustling, shooting, & just bad men, get this book."
5,Goes a long way,"My entire family uses Dr. Bronners Lavender soap. I bought the gallon because it's just a great value. I put it into smaller containers and use it around the house, shower, hand soap, even household cleaning. It smells lovely and it's simple."
2,"The product is very good. But, cover is too bad. so, contents leaked out.","The product is very good. But, cover is too bad. so, contents leaked out.The product is very good. But, cover is too bad. so, contents leaked out."
5,My favorite soap,I use this soap for a variety of uses. I just wish my grocery stores would carry this size. Great product.
5,Excellent Size,"I have previous brought the 32 oz bottle of this soap and loved it. Because it is used by the family, my 32 oz bottle soon was empty. Gallon bottle is a better deal for a family use. Thanks."
3,"Wisteria's, beatifull","but very difficult plants... VERY difficult... i will never buy this kind of bonsai unless i see it for myself, not far away..."
4,Nothing else matters,"This third CD from my brotha' Marvin is an excellent addition to your spirtual CD collection. Although the Grace & Mercy is my all time favorite CD by Marvin. This third project offers some really nice tracks. One thing that impressed me is the CD is not loaded with a lot of electronic techo-pop stuff, it's straight forward. This is a must buy for your collection"
5,Definitely NOT a Sophomore Slump!,"Mr. Servon really impressed me with this album. He did a great job with all of the songs. Props to Serv. Beats by the Pound put out some tight beats to help Serv and the guest appearances like Pig Pun and C-Murder were the sh*t. My favorite songs were ""From N.Y. to N.O."" and ""My Story"" with KLC. Mr. Servon deserves to go Gold with this record for show."
5,"ROWDY AS THE F*CK N*GGA, BOUTIT AS THE F*CK N*GGA!","This cd impressed the hell of out of me! I never thought Serv-on could bring it with the beats and the raps, BUT HE DOES! He's tight as hell on his second cd. This is DA NEXT LEVEL, for real. He teams up with Fiend on his tracks 2 and 3 and give a BOMB start for his cd. Serv-on is tight! There's only one thing i don't like about his cd.......................................................nah f*ck that! It's the SH*T!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Please leave No Limit!!!!,Mr. Serv On is a knock to the great artist on No Limit. He is terrible!! He doesn't even sing with the music. I think this cd was sorry just like Serv On.
4,Underated,This is still one of my favorite all-time No Limit cd's...This cd was highly underated and underappreciated...I love this album to this day and always will remember some of the bangin No Limit cd's and how No Limit made the game what it is today...
5,A fine debut novel,"In this debut novel, the first of what one hopes to be many more from this writer, Walter J Roers has skillfully crafted a novel full of the reminiscences of childhood sensations and perceptions. He is concerned with what is glibly termed ""the human condition"". Moral themes play throughout the book: concepts such as understanding and foregiveness, opportunities missed and opportunities shared, trust and responsibility."
4,A Look at Discovering Life's Realities in the 50's,"The Pact reawakens numerous memories of growing up in post war America. The place, Minneapolis, could be any neighborhood. The businesses and the characters are all there. Intertwined in this nostolgia is a gripping story of coming to relization that everything isn't beautiful. The youngsters in this book lived on your block, or perhaps were you. It is a sensitive story that is compared to Angela's Ashes by the publisher. It is more like a Jean Sheperd story with a more serious approach."
2,Poorly Written,"Despite the fact that this book is edited, and not written entirely, by L'Abate is strange, because the writing is particuarly dense, wordy and generally poorly organized. I found this text a tough one to slog through, with a few gems here and there hidden among the muck. This was required reading for a class, which surprised me, considering how out of date the book is. If you can find another text, do so. If this is required for you...good luck!"
1,This book is great if you want to be 50 years out of date.,"This book is full out completely sexist and outdated information. For example, it refers to overbearing parenting as ""Momism"", suggests that schizophrenia is caused by bad parenting, and regularly cites questionable research from the 1950s. I suspect that the positive reviews for this book were posted by the publisher or by the author himself. This book will actually damage you if you try to use it to learn how to be a counselor.Skip this book and read something that is actually informed by the developments from the last 50 years. Maybe in 2050 L'Abate will write about the things that are going on now."
4,Does the job nicely,I have a large size 120v power cable and cat 5 running through these and it looks great. There is room for at least another large size cable. I do need to break a cable or two out midway through the wiremold and I just have to leave it unsnapped at that spot.
3,Shipping damage!!!,"Price is great. Better than my local hardware stores BUT when I received item the box was bent like 3/4 quarters of the way so the rest of the wiremold I had no use for. Its a good thing I had just enough to cover all my wires. Good stuff though, the sticking is VERY strong Im pretty sure it will rip off paint if you ever remove. I would buy it again."
1,Completely useless,It wouldn't stick to my wall and I ended up wasting half an hour wrangling with cords and the stupid cord channels for nothing.
4,"Good product, poor delivery","I actually ordered 8 of these, and they shipped all 8 of them in individual packages (what a waste of material), and some of them were damaged in shipment (bent/crimped), but did not adversely affect the project I was working on. Overall, I would rate this 4.5 out of 5 stars, since the price difference in buying them retail was good, and the time to ship was great, given that Hurricane Ike interrupted shipments to my area."
3,Just because I want to,"The production team of Jeff Katz and Jerry Kasenetz, collectively remembered as Super K Productions, were responsible for hundreds of singles and dozens upon dozens of LPs, all produced during a relatively short span of three years (1967 - 70). They are best known, of course, as the creators and marketers of ""bubblegum"" music, a term they coined to describe the light, innocent pop tunes that brought them international fame. This CD contains some of their rarest tracks. The first ten songs could be described as bubblegum, but the last four tracks sound more like late '60s or early '70s hard rock. Not all the songs are great, or even good, but they are all at least interesting. Fans of bubblegum music should check it out."
4,"Not their best, but don't miss it","As a semi-fanatic, long-time fan of Motorpsycho, I have to say that I think this might be one of their weakest releases so far. But it still kicks butt and they're still one of the best bands of the 90's. Too bad most of you yanks out there are gonna miss out...."
4,The best Band you never heard of,"Take Led Zeppelin, add some Sonic Youth, some perfect pop and you've got a great album that covers a lot of ground - fantastic ecstatic guitars, and a modern fresh sound that makes the whole album exciting. Only motorpsycho could put on a record the melodic soft lullaby ""Nathaniel's tune from Hawaii"" Too bad mpsycho seems happy with their limited commercial success - such music is too good to remain unknown. Go see them live if you can: they played the US at SXSW in Austin, TX and blew everyone away (the audience, as well as all other bands who played a gig). Get a hand on ""Timothy's Monster"", on ""Angels and Deamons at Play"" and on their latest ""Trust US"". You will send me an email and thank me for it..."
2,set came with 5 defective disc,The set as most people know has come with 5 defective discs...i put in request with cbs video to have them shipped and i was PRoMISED by 12-10 ...i called them after not having received them and the cbs rep says they HAVE not been shipped out and there is NO estimated date on when it will happen ..THAT IS TERRIBLE SERVICE FROM A COMPANY THAT ISSUES A REMASTERED SET ...well i will keep waiting but for now i have to give a bad ratign on this set until the replacement disc are receivd...
5,The Fugitive Collection !!!,I am very happy with the Collection of The Fugitive !!! I would definitely recommend this to everyone I know ! It came to be quite early and in Perfect Shape !
5,3 FINE SONATAS,5 STARS because this is another great album.The sound is clear with no noise i can hear.The playing is great here.The booklet was quite helping and worth reading.These are some of the best of EDVARD.
4,A different take,"I'll keep this review short and sweet, as others more expert than I have already submitted reviews.I liked this version of Swan Lake. I think it is a worthy addition and I enjoyed seeing this different take on set design. My main pet peeve while watching this, however, is that some characters seem to blend into the dark set (especially those with longer, dark dresses or dark tights).As far as the dancing goes, I felt that it was very good and it was an enjoyable piece. I would recommend this DVD to someone who isn't necessarily looking for uber-traditional set-design."
4,Novelty PIece,Is it art? Not sure. Is it different? Yes. Definitely one of a kind and astounding in many ways.
5,a christmas story,"Alvin wants a harmonica, and then alvin sees a kid who is sick and he learns that life is important and helps the kid get better. Sweet story brought to you by the chimpmunks."
3,"Works well, but 'quick connects' leak.","This tester works very well, but only after you take the 'quick-connect' end off the cap that has it, and put gas-line thread tape on the threads, then re-install it. I also had to disassemble the gauge unit, reversing the safety plug with the quick-connect plug, so that i could install the unit and monitor the pressure via the intake side of the engine. Tested my Prostar with ISX Engine, and after 20 minutes at 30PSI with air supply switched off, I only lost about 1psi after the mods I had to make to the unit."
5,meditational dub for everyone,"for those that like dub music and its transcendental waves of elongenated sound waves-here is a cd for you. call it new age or new wave or world music-but the conscious spirit digs musical mediums for its endless need to express itself. the electronica dimension is a glorious filler and adhesive to this modern adaptation of some very beautiful tradtional ethnical instruments. good music for meditation,contemplation,or simple relaxation! namaste' ya'll"
5,another great album,"I purchased this album a few days ago and love it. I still enjoy flames better because it is more on the dub side, but this one is definitly up there with the best in this genre."
3,"WELL CRAFTED, BUT UNEXCITING","The brief description on Amazon initially likened Titan Force to Jag Panzer. That may be because it's the same vocalist, Harry Conklin, in both bands. Harry left Jag Panzer for a while to form Titan Force before rejoining his original band, and recorded two Titan Force albums, of which ""Titan Force"" is the first. Although the songcraft, musicianship and production are all of high quality, the material seems uninspired and seems to lack the spark of energy that all rock music needs. I had the opportunity to see him perform this material live at Union Station in Colorado Springs a couple of months ago (his hometown), before going over to perfom in Germany. Live, this music is better than the recording, but unfortunately, Titan Force never gave me the adrenaline rush and chills that good heavy metal is supposed to provide to its listeners."
4,A Librarie's Best Kept Secret,"This was not the best book I have ever read,but it was one of those surprise books that jump out at you on the bookshelf as an interesting I cannot put it down read. It was insightful and interesting as well as enjoyable and I would recommend this book to basically anyone young or old. Kudos."
2,where's the plot?,"Twelve is a major disappointment on many levels. It's about a teenage boy who has to quit school and deal drugs so his classmates feel content having their fix. The problem? That's pretty much all that happens, other than several parties and a few sex scenes. Only one particular shooting scene caught my attention for the shock value. It's so much a teen flick that an adult wouldn't be able to sit through this plotless nonsense. In addition to these problems, Kiefer Sutherland does the narration and it's a VERY rare day when I'm disappointed in a movie starring Kiefer Sutherland. He made a mistake signing up for this pitiful role. Avoid."
2,Twelve,"Didn't really like this film. It wasn't the film I thought that it was; so that was my mistake. Ok, but not really interesting to me."
