2,Stalin's Last Crime,Fascinating well researched subject matter but somewhat ruminative and tedious. I found that could skip through many pages and find that the same events were being described yet again.
1,Deception,Amazon.com advertises this book as a hardcover. It is really a binder and in no way a hardcover. The binder is complete with a large amounts of photographs concerning stone surfaces. The pictures account for about ninty five percent of the binder. The binder offers basic information concerning the planning of a stone project. The pictures are nice and they provide the name to each stone. The binder is overpriced and you would find the same information in other less expensive books concerning stone identification.
4,The first post 2008 revised edition review (this book),"The reviews below have been transfered from the 2006 edition, probably because the authors haven't changed. However this is a mistake. Lonely Planet did listen to customers and the book is now over a 100 pages longer and contains much more information on all regions of PNG and the Solomons. Sure, it's still not what it was when the countries had seperate guidebooks, but now the PNG part is almost as complex and the Solomons are getting there - the section is almost twice the length. So now this is quite a good guide for PNG at least (haven't tested on the Solomons). The advice is very useful as media coverage of PNG is generally only bad and quite false and the listings seemed accurate. As this is the only guide to PNG it probably doesn't need recomendation, but at least now you can buy it knowing that the new edition IS useful!"
3,Review,"I bought this book hoping it would be helpful for the Solomon Islands. There was only about 30 pages about the Solomons. This book is a great guide for Papua New Guinea. I would suggest looking for older guides. I bought an older guide from lonely planet that was strictly about the Solomon Islands. It was much better, only the finacial info was definitely out of date."
3,Wish there was more information about various locations,"The book does not really give sufficient information about the villages which are, in fact, memorable experiences. Nonetheless, I am not aware of a better source for information about places in PNG and so recommend that someone traveling to PNG buy this book. There are a few other good books about the culture and art."
4,An informative LP book,"I read the parts I was interested in and found it useful as all the LP books are. Nothing unusual here, just a good guide to a neglected corner of the world."
1,This filter quality is not as good as the OEM!,"I would recommend staying away from this filter. The OEM filter is about $6 and is a little denser, preventing dirt from damaging your motor. I used this for one ride and could see that dirt was getting to the inside layer. My OEM would not allow dirt to enter as far."
2,"Two stars for the quality of the bedding,,,,,,,","Other than that, it is very ugly in person. I will be returning this comforter. Try some of the other colors, you will not be disappointed"
4,"While not entirely neccesary, it is useful...","The GM's screen is a very useful piece of gear for any GURPS GM, containing all of the pertinent information right at your fingertips. It sure beats having to search the rulebooks for this table or that."
2,fNice finish - could be great but FLAWED,No hole for the camera! Plastic belt/pocket clip broke withing 3 weeks. Finish is excellent and the ergomonics are great. The best design out there but needs improvement. Clip won't grab thin fabric if you plan to use it inside a pocket. Never your shirt pocket or kiss it goodbye down the toilet if you do!Comes with very good screen cover stick'em which is easy to apply.Lack of camera hole a bad oversight but simply slide the camera up a bit and your good to go.Griffin - Fix it! The hole and the clip. It's worth it as it really is very good with the iPhone doesn't make it bigger or obstruct the iphone of make it hard to remove and sync in the cradle.2 out of 10 for mostly for the bad clip.
1,Useless for 32 gb 3gs,I would say i wasted my money on this. My iphone does not even fit in.No problem with the vendor.
1,Poor Design,This item is worthless mostly due to the poor quality plastic at the hinge of the attachment. Broke in the second day of use. Don't buy this
1,DO NOT BUY,This product broke within 5 minutes of my taking it out of the box and placing my iPhone in it. The belt clip breaks off even under the slightest pressure. I blame myself for buying such a cheap piece of garbage.
1,Piece of junk,"I bought one, and the clip broke off after a week.I bought a second one and the clip broke off as I TOOK IT OUT OF THE PACKAGE.save your money, the iphone3 doesent even fit properly anyhow"
1,Give away your money into donation instead buying this stupid product.,"I was happy to recieve it, the moment i tried to hang it to my belt, it broke into two pieces. The clip is very bad and poor quality. However, i kept the phone inside the cover for a week, later when i took out my phone, the white phone turned out to be murky black. I was so frustrated. Anyways, dont buy it."
1,Five Star service - no star product quality,Great customer service. First item arrived with a manufacture defect and seller REPLACED within 5 days. The 2nd holster's clip broke within a week of using it. Poor quality design by Griffin Elan.
1,Dont Buy it,"it works only for couple of months,it breaks after that, the clip !!my brown one broke last week(after 3 months usage)black one broke on the first day itself, remember i am a gentle user not like turning it left and right and 90 deg - 360 degrees all the time like a kid.do not buy, dont waste your money on this silly useless product !!!agree this is very convenient but worth for the money??? NOOOOOO !!"
1,"Clip has broken, twice!","I love this product, except for one major problem: the clip has now broken on two units in a row. Both lasted about 3-4 months. I'd like to find something that lasts longer as I don't think it is fair to have to buy a new one of these 3-4 times a year."
2,I've broken two of them,"This case/clip is great for easy access to your iPhone and it does a good job of protecting it. HOWEVER, it's easy to break. I've been through two already. The problem is that if it snags on anything there's little give and the plastic clip will easily snap. Buyer beware. If you're very careful this is a great option. If you're looking for something more forgiving and durable I'd look elsewhere...."
2,Clip broke on 4 different ones,"Length:: 0:45 MinsHere's my review of the Griffin Elan case. I've had 4 of these cases, and the clips has broken on all of them."
2,Good case - bad belt clip,"Great case - I carried the phone backwards to avoid scratching - but like the other reviewers, the belt clip snapped off - too bad, but I am looking for another case now."
3,Nice Case- weak clip,"I used the first case for a couple of months before the clip broke. Griffin sent me a replacement, but it is not the Snap-in model. The clip slides over the belt but it does not swivel. It is not as secure. I like the swivel feature of the Snap-in model, so I will buy another one, or ones when they break. Maybe someone will make a better replacement with the same feautres."
1,Packed to bursting with innacuracies and outright lies.,"A typically hysterical, ill-researched and paranoid treatment of psychiatry, which is the kind of stuff one comes to expect from Scientology (which CCHR is aligned with). When this video is not stating flat-out lies, it's a tour de force of inaccuracies, acceptable truths, revisionism, and poorly presented propaganda. In short, it's a wretched work of unrivalled rubbish."
3,Worth watching.,"Despite the connection to the Church of Scientology, I feel that this documentary is worth watching. It is one of those documentaries where the creators went in with an obvious agenda, but they nevertheless point out a lot of startling facts, both historical and contemporary, about the ""luminaries"" in the field of psychiatry, as well as the industry's web of links to government and pharmaceutical companies. You don't have to be a conspiracy theorist to take some of value from this."
3,It's ok...\George\10,"It's okay, I mean I saw even worse tycoon games then this one. I enjoy it when I'm really bored though. Otherwise I wouldn't play it. I don't have alot of games. But... I can tell what a bad game is. For example really bad graphics. If you like getting bored, like rides and building your own theme park, and are looking for a rated ""E"" game I ersonally would recomend this. I"
4,Boring -,"This game is fun and everything, but it eventually gets annoying. Even if you carefully spend money without going over budget, you still might not be able to buy anything but a bathroom. I still haven't got how you build scenery buildings; It's just so complicated."
2,"A detailed book of ""how to, hands on"" leadership set in WWII",The book tells the story of an Air Force leaders struggle to turn around the morale and effective-ness of a heavy bomb group in the European Theater of Operations during the Second World War; and by so doing very possibily save the role of strategic bombing in the overall strategy for the conduct and execution of that war. The book unfortunately is not as focused and as effective as the 1949 motion picture of the same name starring Gregory Peck (as General Savage).
1,Discontinued - Out of Date,I purchased this from Amazon Nov 2006. I loved it all this time. But this is not an inexpensive item and I expected to be able to use it for a number of years.The battery life is very low lasting no more thatn 1.5 years. Not horrible in itselfBut this is a discontinued product from HP and is no longer supported by them. They offer no software updates at all.WORST: The Tom Tom Maps are already out of date on this system. The newest Maps available either from HP or from Tom Tom are dated April 2007 and they will not be provding any more because Tom Tom also no longer supports this.I have read that you can by a Garmin XT card for $99 and use the Garmin Software instead. I may be stuck with that unless I want to trash the HP entirely but you don't have to be. Buy something more up to date.
1,HP will not honor warranty,"After careful review, I purchased the rx5915 Travel Companion 2 months ago. I was initially very pleased with the product. During a road trip, I turned the unit on, and found that the display no longer worked. I called HP and arranged for a return for warranty repair. HP called several days later and informed me that the display was broken, and that the repair would not be covered by the warranty. I told them that the unit had never been abused or dropped, and was simply used as a portable GPS, as sold. Basically I got nowhere, and was forced to pay $230 to have the unit repaired. To further add insult, they informed me that to simply return the unit unrepaired would cost $50! Needless to say, HP is now off my list, and I would strongly advise against buying a product like this from them since they are obviously not standing behind it. I have never had such poor warranty service."
4,"Good, just good.","Bought this item mostly for the GPS and for the Pocket PC operating system. I use Epocrates for the Pocket PC so couldn't get around the need for Windows Mobile operating system. The GPS uses TomTom which is pretty excellent. It got me through a snowstorm at night to the Boyne Highlands! I had never been to the Boyne Highlands before and it got me right to the doorstep. Unfortunately, it doesn't appear to have every point of interest placed in it's maps correctly. I was looking for ""Spicy Bob's Italian Express"" in Boyne City, the device directed me to the right road but at a spot approxiamately 1.5 miles down the road. Overall a good device, but the address problems concern me. Greg."
1,MANY ISSUES,My rating for this item is very low as I have not been able to use it yet as a GPS device. I never managed to get it to workk properly. Following HP phone support I upgraded firmware and maps. But behavior was still erratic. I shipped it back to HP in early August under HP instructions. It worked properly for a couple of days when I received it back but has started to behave erratically again and it is going to be shipped back to HP again....To say I am not satisfied is an understatement !
2,this companion is lacking...,"I have an iPaq PDA and I own a TomTom GPS -- both of which work well. This combo iPaq/TomTom is 'in the rough' and needs to undergo some re-tooling. I'm surprised that other reviewers mention what I deem significant flaws and then go on to rate the unit as a 4 or 5 star. For example, the Travel Companion stalls and needs soft-resets. For a right handed person, the stylus is awkward. Support is not good. Moving through programs can be painfully SLOW. The GPS tracking lags. I depend on my GPS and PDA for business travel. Buy the rx5915 if you like to play with gadgets as it's loaded with some fun stuff. But, not if you need something dependable while on the road."
1,Don't buy this -- it locks up and quits talking. The Garmin 660 is much better in almost all ways. That's what I bought after,Don't buy this -- it locks up and quits talking. The Garmin 660 is much better in almost every way. That's what I bought after returning this one.
3,"Small, somewhat effective","Purchased HP rx9515 for storing books, information, etc, as well asGPS capabilities. I lost part of the icons on the desktop (for memorystatus, battery reserve, etc) the first week I had the unit. I havenever been able to figure out how to retrieve them, short of re-installing Windows Mobile (disk not included), and all of the softwareI have already placed on the device.My unit tends to crash at least once a day, requiring a reset to getthings back to normal. This may be due to a number of programsloaded on the optional SD card, although it is not even half full.The unit and screen are rather small for my taste, but mightbe perfect for others."
4,Works great after fix,"I bought this after reading several reviews that were written soon after the product was released. Some patches were issued that seemed to fix the issues raised. I got mine, went to the HP web site to download and install the updates. After that the GPS quit working. Customer support was great."
1,Think twice before buying this,"I live in Hawaii and the GPS function is terrible. It takes forever to get a satellite fix. I don't understand it as my Magellan GPS unit will normally get the first fix within a minute or so. The Tomtom navigator software is not very functional in Hawaii. A lot of the addresses here have numbers combined with dashes (e.g. 99-251 Kamehameha Hwy) but the software doesn't recognize that and won't let you insert dashes. Hence, all the addresses on Kamehameha Hwy become the address 99.There is also a problem with Wlan connectivity. It has a hard time keeping a connection, even though I'm sitting just 7 feet away from my router.The idea is a good one but the execution is poor. Not recommended!"
1,GPS locks up and wanders. Poor for GPS,"I bought this unit from amazon and had trouble with the first and returned it for a second. The second had the same problems. The GPS would freeze up, wander off the road into the middle of of the desert. It would show the icon going down the road sideways or 45 degrees off. If I switched views, then it would start to work again or I would have to do a soft reset. At times I would have to reset it every 5 minutes. HP had no good advice and tech support was poor.When the unit worked I loved it. The wireless was great, the tomtom software was outstanding. I really wanted the GPS to work because of how much I liked the PDA integration and how it operated. I'm hoping HP will find a fix and I will reconsider this item in a few years. Too bad. It had great potential."
4,Palm Convert,"I was VERY hesitant to even try something other than a Palm. I have had a Palm since 1997. I am extremely pleased. The GPS doesn¡t speak out the street name, but it does tell you turn at the right place at the right time. I don¡t think there is as much software for the Pocket PC as there is for the Palm. It is an adjustment switching over from the Palm, so just be prepared"
3,Wish they didn't include Worldmate,"Have had Activesync problems. They seem to be related to the Worldmate application. Can't remove Worldmate from the PDA. I like the info in Worldmate, it just causes problems.The display is good.The stylus is mounted for left handed use.The GPS is not as easy to shut off as the Wifi or Bluetooth and it consumes the most energy."
5,best travel mate you can find,I owned it only a few days and been testing it around the area this the best thing that came for travlers in years. The Tom Tom GPS work great coem with everything you need to hook it up to a rental car and when you not using the gps it's also great in picking up my email and doing my spread sheets in excel. Then when all done you can relax with the window media when play your mp3. Only thing I wish is came with a better case to pack all the plugs and bracket for traveling and I think a good idea to buy a big SD card and extra battery. But over all great unit you won't reget it.
4,ipaq rx5915,"Powerful, convenient, value for money PDA/GPS package. Slightly big and heavy for use as a PDA to carry around everyday, though large enough to display sufficient features for a GPS to be functional. It seems to take a while for the GPS signal to lock in and hold a signal and occasionally the signal is lost while driving despite clear skies and the GPS having a clear view of the sky. The interface is fine, though I think Belkin's GPS software is slightly better overall. I do not like the fact that it does not tell you whether your destination is on the left or right hand side of the road. I also wish the input keyboard was in qwerty format and had an auto-complete feature to save time when inputting addresses. I also wish that it would at least pronounce names of freeways when giving directions. Overall though, it has no competition because of its excellent PDA and above average GPS functionality in an affordable price."
1,HORRIBLE gps,I bought this for the ppv function so I use it for this.The GPS is useless.I have never had it even find a signal.If I could do it over I would get a dedicated ppc and if I need a GPS I'll buy one.
2,Fundamentally flawed,"The HP iPAQ 5915 is a misbegotten hybrid of multiple bad systems. The ONLY place it shines is in the navigational software functionality. All else is garbage.HP's links to Windows and TomTom are not streamlined, meaning the device frequently conflicts with software provided by one or the other manufacturers. Updates and additions require frequent rebooting and shutting down of ""services"" before the device can be activated.Finally, Windows Mobile is arcane, poorly mixed and with a lousy UI. What else can you say about software that makes you descend multiple menu trees just to set up USB or wireless syncing?!? Then, of course, it doesn't work, often without any indication as to why.Do not buy."
1,GPS not as expected,"GPS freeze quite often when travel over than one hour and errors of locating destination are 4 out of 10. Other than that, most functions in IPAQ RX5915 are fine."
4,Perfect for working outdoors with my 13' Macbook,"I use this every month in direct sunlight without a problem. You can see the screen perfectly. One of the most important features is the ability to collapse it and stuff it into a bag. There are no hard sides so it will fit anywhere and the lack of hard siding doesn't impact the performance. A true ""A"" Product."
3,"good fit, but not so dark",I find that large amounts of light behind me lessen the darkening by the screen from the sides.
4,Great Auto Trans Cooler,This is an excellent automobile automatic transmission cooler for your car. It fits nicely on most cars right in front of the condenser and radiator. Just remember to put some insulating foam between this and the condenser. If this cooler touches the condenser it will transfer the heat to your conderser coils and reduce the efficiency of your A/C system dramatically. The only better cooler is an even bigger cooler.
4,Good Cleanser,"Cetaphil Cleanser is one of the very best out there. I have very sensitive skin. Even when I use dove soap, my skin immediately turns red and itchy. I was introduced to this product when I went to the beauty shop. Every time I use it, my face literally shines. Although I have to say, my face turns a little dry after using it, but I will still continue to use it because it does make my skin itchy or break out."
1,Worst Cleanser i ever used.,"Ever since i started using this cleanser, i had these red bumps all over my chin.. it was hideous. Once i changed cleanser it went away. would never ever buy this again.."
4,Ana Caram Rio After Dark,Rio after dark is one of my favorite Bossa Nova albums. Being a huge fan of Bossa Nova I would consider this a masterpiece. The sounds are soothing as Bossa Nova should be. If your not a fan of Bossa Nova you will be after listening to this album.
2,mediocre travel book,"This book is less about the Jerusalem that Bellow visited and more about himself. Indeed, his presence is so pronounced that he appears more fascinated with his own perceptions than he is with what he is witnessing, or so it seemed to me. While the writing is clear and vivid, I can now recall virtually nothing of what he describes, except for himself and his personal reactions - it is he who sees things more clearly than his hosts, etc etc. After 100 pages, this is boring. Alas, I got nothing out of this and it is also badly dated.Not recommended."
5,Give me a keg of beer...and these,"What a great movie. Memorable performances all around, a visciously luscious soundtrack, and Lemonade. Lemonade my man, what it is? I ca'nt believe this isnt available through Amazon.com."
1,look,"Mmmmmm...Michael J. Fox in a wolf costume...tasty! What more can I say about such a great movie? Well, let's give it a try. Favorite Character: Styles (played by Jerry Levine). What an actor. Sorry to see he didn't make the trip to Tenn Wolf, Too!"
3,"""Fox turns wolf....wolf....scott. just try scott. "" teachers","What movie combines the names of Boof, Stiles and Chubbie into one film? This one does.... eggggcelllllent performances by michael j. fox and other actors/actresses you will never see again. right."
4,It's a HOOWWWLLL of a movie!!!,"Scott Howard is going through some changes in life. Changes that will affect his standing in school, on the basketball court and in love. Scott has just found out he's a werewolf. As he is more popular and accepted as the wolf, its hard for Scott to give it up, there by pushing away his friends that he already has.Released in the period when Michael J Fox was incredibly popular, with his Back To The Future releases, sees him in another hard to forget role of his career. As the story was made in the mid-80's, the storyline is quite simple and very cliché and probably wouldn't stand out as a good movie compared to releases of today. Although it is a fantastic movie based purely on nostalgic value and would be great for teens and adults alike who have yet to see it. Recommended viewing."
3,Classic must-see 80s film,"No matter how many years have gone by since Scott Howard first ""wolfed"" into the one the most unforgettable characters of all time in the movies.This film still remains one of the most fun movies to watch. Micheal J.Fox does a great job as Scott Howard having to face the adversity of being a part-time werewolf.Scott(Fox)uses what at first he thinks is a problem(being a werewolf) to his adavantage throughout the movie.However Scott becomes sidetracked by the pressure of living up to the expectations of being a ""popular high school teen wolf"" There are several memorable moments in this classic 80s film, but in the end can Scott be a winner by just being himself."
2,teen wolf vhs,"The vhs of this movie has off color tint to it,it's not as good as the dvd version.So to me it sucks,but if that person who wants it,and only has a vcr,it's better than nothing"
5,Best Book Thus Far,"My sleep doctor gave me this book on my first visit, he keeps several copies in his office. That on it's own states it must be a good book to read. I read this book in one night! There were so many things about Narcolepsy that I didn't know and what makes it easy, informative and sometimes funny to read are the stories written by a narcoleptic about being diagnosed, each step of acceptance, each main symptom and how she has continued living her life with this illness. Kinda outdated but very informative for newly diagnosed patients or even the family members so they can get an idea of what you are going through w/out them quizzing you everytime you talk to them!"
3,"An interesting read, but a bit unreliable","I have recently been diagnosed with Narcolepsy. I read this book and enjoyed reading the author's experiences. However, she openly admitts that she has not tried recommended treatements. So, it is difficult to understand the true extent of the disease, when there are so many ways to help control the disease. I would like to read a book written by someone who has tried the available solutions. There may be much more hope than indicated in this book.On a completely different note, the book cover design is very poor. I'm a graphic artist and can't help remarking on layout of the cover. But, that has nothing to do with what is written on the inside, it's just a personal objection I have. As they say, ""Don't Judge a Book by it's Cover!"""
3,Ok but others are probably better,"We bought this stroller for a trip to Europe -- we wanted something light and easy to fold that would handle uneven pavement. It is light. It is fairly easy to fold although you need to wear shoes (e.g., fold it before removing shoes to go through airport security). I have to agree with other reviewers that it does not handle well. It is nearly impossible to steer with one hand, making it difficult to pull luggage and push stroller at the same time. In the end, we may have been better off just taking our old Graco which handles much better and has more storage."
2,Be Careful,"When first received this appeared to be a good item. After only two months of very limited use the spot welds have broken off of the bulb brackets causing me to have to wire the bulb into the unit to keep it from falling out. In addition, the thumb screws will not tighten enough to keep the magnifying head level and steady. You are always looking through it at an angle and can not look straight down through it.The magnifying head works as advertised as far as viewing is concerned and I like the round flourescent bulb surrounding the magnifying lens.Buyer beware!"
4,An excellent textbook for students in library studies,"For those seeking a structural approach to reference and information resources, this textbook will provide a much more useful approach than its competitors. Not without limitations, Bopp and Smith provide an excellent introduction to information services and the nature of those resources which support such services. One great advantage to my mind is the provision of a more complete historical context to the sources than provided by Bill Katz's excellent competing text."
5,Great for cats and everything else,"I buy this scent specifically to bathe my 4 cats and on days when I'm going to work in the yard to help ward off bug bites. I started out with their famous peppermint scent and now the tree oil is my favorite with lavender a close second. I also like the bar soaps and lip balm. Although a little pricey, they all last a long time, are excellent quality and are healthy for us and the environment-what more could one ask?"
2,My Expectations Were too High,"I bought this Floormate because my tile floor has grooves that just hold too much daily traffic dirt, leaving it looking awful constantly even immediately after a typical mopping. I desperately needed a mop of some sort that would scrum deep down and pick up dirt easily. The scrubbers on the Hoover Floormate work, for a while, each cleaning. But they don't scrub down hard enough to get it up without taking me an hour at least in my kitchen and dining area. PLUS after about an hour or even less, something happens to the machine that lifts the scubbers in protest and I have to let it rest for a bit before it will work again. So yes, I was disappointed, but then again, maybe my expectations were too high and I need to bite the bullet and re-tile my floor."
2,Unorthodox to say the least.,"Leonard Bernstein adopted some SLOW tempos in his late DG recordings. For me, this, the Tchaikovsky 'Pathetique' and the Elgar 'Enigma' Variations go too far, beyond 'conductor's discretion' and almost render the works unrecognizable. I guess this is worth hearing once if you mainly want 'different', but there are plenty of recordings of merit inhabiting the mainstream of this highly familiar work."
3,Keeping it put,"The ear hook lets the headset flop around when wearer is active. This leaves earpiece and microphone mis-positioned, difficult to hear or be heard. In regular use, answer/end button works well and sound is very clear."
4,Very fine chain,"Chain is very fine, to the point that I first wondered if it was strong enough to safely hold my pendant. Catch is also very tiny."
2,Didn't last,"Had this for quite a while, but didn't use very often. The gear coupling that attaches the motor shaft to the blades is made of a rubberized plastic. I guess the ice was a little too much for the blades and the gears in the base were stripped. Now the motor cannot turn the blades, so it is useless. Can't find replacement parts, so it has to go in the trash. Too bad because we liked everything else about it, but a good product has to last, and if they use metal gears, it would still work. Cheap parts make this a bad product to buy."
2,Smoke Signals,"My parents wanted the same smoothie maker that my sister has, and this is it. My sister hasn't had any trouble with hers at all. She's had it for a couple of years but uses it rarely. I researched this one and was leary to buy it because it's terrible track record of breaking. I tried to find another with the same features within my price range and couldn't find anything. So reluctantly, I bought this one hoping for the best. My mom didn't get to finish making her first pitcher of drinks before it started smoking! Amazon had excellent service and sent us a new one before we could even get the old one in the mail. I haven't heard yet if the new one is holding up or not. If you don't have to have the spout on the bottom, I would recommend the Osterizer blender. I have made a hundred great smoothies in mine."
1,Broke in 6 months,"I've had this brand before and it lasted 2-3 years with weekly use... this time, the nozzle snapped within 6 months... very disappointed"
2,Can't get replacement part,"My problem with the blender is that the coupling broke (either wore down from the blender not being exactly down in the slot or it stripped the inside so it won't screw back on.) There is no way to replace it. Back to Basics seems to have many other replacement parts available, but not that one. The glass is nice though.We had it for less than a year."
1,Don't buy this ! Leaks around blade's drive shaft,"This blender was great, for while, it turned frozen fruit, ice cubes and your favorite rum into an awesome smoothie. However, after a few months, the gaskets that seals around the blade's drive shaft began to leak (the non-replaceable ones). It leaks whether you are running the blades or not. As you make a drink it will leak all over the counter as soon as you pour in liquid. I sure didn't get my money's worth out of this and you probably won't either. I expected it to AT LEAST last a year before breaking. Don't get this one. Booooo!"
4,Make your own smoothies,"Seems to be well made and is relatively attractive for a (modified) blender (though I have previously read not-so-good reviews). We've used it a few times, and it does what it supposed to do. If you are looking for a real smoothie maker, as opposed to just a blender, this is the probably the best one around for the price."
1,Beware of not cleaning the dispenser properly,"The problem is that to clean the container properly, you need to remove the cap or dispenser. Then it becomes difficult to get the cap on & off, or the dispenser starts leaking. Once I tried to clean the container without removing the dispenser. True story--the next time I went to use my smoothie maker, there were fly larvae in the dispenser. Disgusting. I was on my 2nd Back to Basics smoothie maker pro when the glass container broke. Come to find out, there are no replacement parts. I purchased a Kitchenaid 3 speed blender. Not only does it make better smoothies, in way less time--you do not even need a stir stick and it is so easy to clean. Well worth the extra cost."
4,Smoothie OK,"This model (from the pic) was sent as a replacement for a Back-to-Basics Smoothie Plus 600 that quit after the first 3 seconds of use.If I'm not mistaken, since there's no description of what's include in this particular machine, the product I was sent included an extra smoothie container. We've used it for about 2 1/2 months and seems to work fine. I'm assuming B2B uses similar motors in all their many machines with different outer housings. For the price, I'd recommend it."
1,back to basic smoothie makers are worthless,"we have had 5 different smoothie makers by BACK TO BASICS, and within 2 months of only using them on an average of 2 x a week, they either, crack at the blade, or base. yesterday I bought this one and it laste 30 seconds and quit! We are not hard on our appliances at all! This was a JOKE, and to top it off, there is NO replacement parts for any of them. If it has any defect, it is trashed. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY"
1,Great honeymoon period....,"Blender did what it was supposed to do, that is, blend fruit into shakes, for about 6 months of use. I was happy.Blender comes with 2 caps for the base - a small screw on tap and a spout. The spout is difficult to clean and adds little benefit so I used the screw on cap. After about 6 months the cap cracked from normal wear and tear and smoothie maker began leak into the base and on the counter top. I reverted to using the spout cap and this cracked after 3--that's right 3--uses. I resorted back to using the small cap wrapped in a towel for about 2 months. Then yesterday during blending the base started to smoke as the bottom part of the blade ground into the smoothie base it is attached to. Plastic splintered everywhere and now I have no smoothie.If a good blender for you is 6 months worth of use, buy this blender. Otherwise I suggest reading reviews of this blender and other blenders from this manufacturer - you will see a common theme. I wish I had..."
4,"Durable, Versatile, Smoothie maker.","Got this as a gift, May of 2006 and unfortunately am searching for another smoothie maker. Not because of a defective item, but the glass container broke, as a result of falling over in the sink. I primarily used the blender for protein shakes and margaritas. The stir stick aids in ensuring everything is blended and the spout is conveinent for pouring directly into a glass while the contents remain mixed. It is easy to use, easy to disassemble, clean, and reassemble. It also comes with a smoothie recipe book and instructions. The only negative thing I could say is that after about a year or so, the bottom of the blender would leak small amounts of liquid into the base that houses the motor. This never affected the motor, just gave me one more thing to clean. I guess the crank that is connected to the blades just got worn? Either way, I would recommend this product and have bought this for two friends as gifts."
2,"Good news, bad news.","I really liked the way the smoothie maker performed, it was awesome at crushing ice! However, like several other people, the spout cracked after 3 months. I ordered a new part, but the new spout broke during the first use. I am now looking for a new brand."
4,Good Smoothie-Maker,"I bought this smoothie-maker after my last Back to Basics smoothie-maker literally went up in smoke. Smoothies are a staple in my diet, an easy way to indulge my sweet tooth without piling on calories. Most of my smoothies are made from skim milk or low-fat yogurt, plus either frozen fruit (strawberries, peaches) or hot chocolate powder and lots of crushed ice. I make a smoothie at least 3-4 times a week during warm weather.This smoothie maker works well. I do not use the dispensing spout -- they seem to end up leaking at some point, so I remove the spout and use the supplied screw-on cover. I like that this model has a glass container and that it has a handle.I've concluded after reading many reviews on different smoothie makers that they just may not last an extended time. Constantly blending ice must be hard on an appliance Hopefully, I'll be wrong and will have this one for years."
4,repeat customer for this product,I have been searching to purchase the Back to Basics as I wore out my previous 2. I believe this is one of the easiest smoothie makers to clean which is important when making smoothies several times daily! The blades could be a little sharper but isn't a huge deal since you have the stir stick.
1,Do NOT Buy,"Okay so this thing seems great at first, the reveiws are so so and it seems like it has power. EXCEPT it cannot be run for long periods of time, so if you are making a full belnder of say a frozen fruit smoothie it will not blend all the fruit therefore leaving you with chunks. If you do run it for too long it starts to stink becuase the motor is burning.Also, it is very very hard to obtain parts, the spout broke just from normal use, which I find now, is common, and I searched online then finally found a phone number to order, the people are rude, the parts are Way too expensive (the spout was $15 plus shipping) and the shipping was terribly slow.I don't know what this would be good for, as evn if you are not blending frozen things, the motor still can't run for longer than a couple of minutes.Save your money, and buy a Hamilton Beach single serve blender, this little guy rocks! It comes with a travel lid and will fit in your car cup holder."
2,"Except for basic information,this book is seriously outdated","I was expecting to get some up-to-date information about this interesting subject, but was disappointed as most of the information is ""old hat"". I suppose I have only myself to blame, as on second look, the web page where this book is reviewed in the ""At a Glance"" section clearly states, ""Second Edition-1995"". My last of this kind of mistake, as one does not need a virtual bookstore to order 5 year old books"
5,An excellent value,"I bought three of these units. Installation, replacing non-motion-sensitive lights of similar size, was straightforward. I soldered all the connections rather than trusting to twisting bare wires together. This meant I needed larger acorn insulaters than were supplied, but that was not a problem. I like the flexible programming the lights allow, including a choice of dusk-to-dawn when needed. I installed compact fluorescent bulbs, providing lots of light for relatively little electricity consumption. Some electronic units are disturbed by compact fluorescents, but these are apparently immune. I shopped around before selecting this lamp -- it was significantly less expensive than others with similar features. Overall it is an excellent value."
5,Fantastic.,"Honestly, one of the best things that I've ever purchased for my home. The style is classy and the product is of excellent quality. It's such a small thing, really, but it is SO AMAZING to never have to worry about turning on/off the outside lights. Someone is dropping by tonight? No worry. We're going to be gone for a few days? No problem. The lights are on when they need to be on and off when they don't. I use the dusk-to-dawn setting since it was going to be difficult to wire the motion sensors in series and I thought it would be tacky to potentially have the lights out of sync. Between these sconces and theHeath Zenith SL-4305-WH Motion-Activated Five-Sided Porch Light, White Brass with Frosted Glassat my front door, I am in complete never-have-to-worry-about-any-outside-light bliss! My only regret is not upgrading to these about 3 years earlier."
1,Motion activation does not work,"This is a nice looking porch light, but my unit only stays ON all the time if programmed for motion activation. I finally gave up and ended up waiting too long to return it and now just use it as an on and off fixture. Be sure you test your order in time to return a defective unit. I was quite disappointed."
3,Disappointed With The Service and Misrepresentation,"Received the (4) fixtures and was satisfied visually but once removed my satisfaction changed a little because they feel cheap. Installation was a breeze but the directions for wiring more than one fixture were not clear so I tried for three days to call the 425-637-9601 number on the brochure. The brochure stated the hours as Pacific time but the message stated that finally made me give up was the one that stated they were at Central time. In addition, the website given on the brochure [...] says it's coming soon. The website given on the message states www.cci-parts.com. I finally hired a professional electrition to wire the the fiture because I didn't want to take the chance of it shorting out."
3,OK. but ....,"This is a cute nice looking item, but it delivers a weak light. I think that there are problems with quality control. The item I got does not function as advertised (but reading other reviews I am under the impression that it is a problem with my item).In sum I would prefer something bigger, brighter and more reliable."
1,Beware of Bootlegs,"Non-official release with bootlegged and pirated material, most of which is available for free within easily-found trading circles.Buyer beware!!!"
5,gaiam mat bag,"exactly what I was looking for. room for bag, block, strap, water. pocket holds ID etc. Nice washed denim. Exactly as described. No cons"
4,a classic that should not be discarded,"I am surprised there is no other comment. I have referred to this book and the information contained in it on several occasions during the past several years. DH Small presents a bird's eye view of the ideas of sexuality with it's customs and hangups throughout the ages. He ties it in with biblical thinking, as well as thinking from Augustine, Aquinas, Luther, the early Greek and Roman thinking, the Bible, Bonhoeffer,Calvin, and others. This is a well written and concise book. I have used information from this book in teaching graduate classes in regards to a quick views of sexual thinking and at times in therapy to correct faulty thinking within Christian marriages.This is the most valuable book that I have that was assigned years ago in a college class. There are times I wish it could be updated."
5,Priceless,This is a very special Omar Khairat album as it features Canadian ballet dancers for the orchestration.One of Khairat's very best.I've listened to this album for the last 20 years of my life!
2,Excellent... but...,"This is a great set of movies, but... I will have to say that the DVD transfer is one of the worst jobs I've ever seen. For a person to notice compression artifacts in the quality of the video, most noticably the crowds in the boxing ring in the first movie to start... I'm sorry, I can't recommend it. If you've never seen it before, watch it, but don't drop your money on this box set."
5,ThErE CaN bE OnLy oNe!!!,This is a great movie indeed. Since im a fan of Lambert I really like all of the Highlander movies. I think its a good story and worth to be seen.
5,Awesome!,"I can't stop playing this CD! It seems to get better with every play. The vocals are fabulous and the instrumentals keep playing in my head. My favorite is ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" one of the great tunes written by Adam. Adam has been fabulous with Norah Jones and even more exciting in this new release with his own band."
4,My daughter loved it!,"My daughter (7yrs. at the time) loved this game. It is hard to find software that is really fun and educational at the same time. Most of the software I buy for her, I have to load it and play at least once so that I can show her how to play. The Zoombinis Island Odyssey was the exception. She had no problem playing it alone. It has a help screen with each activity that explains in detail. It is very easy to navigate and has multiple levels of play. We loved it so much that we now have The Zoombinis Logical Journey and Mountain Rescue."
3,Wish it wouldn't crash so much...,"I loved this game as a child, and when I saw it for so cheap on Amazon I bought it on a whim. Everything is exactly as I remember and the game itself is still pretty fun. However, the game encounters an error and shuts itself down at least 70% of the time I start it up (Dell laptop with Windows XP). I would have been able to beat the game already if it didn't crash within a few minutes of starting, usually before I am able to save my progress. I'm not very tech-savvy but I guess its just not very compatible with the newer systems, sadly."
4,Sound problems,"I totally agree with Gregory Sargent's review. The 5.1 surround sound mix is terrible, I thought my left speaker blew when I first watched it but it turned out to be the DVD. The 2 channel stereo has the best sound.The DVD is awesome, and I totally loved ""The Water is Wide"" performance. simple beautiful.Totally recommend it.PS. Don't you think that Jewel seemed to be pissed with Sarah M during the song? Did you notice the body language? And they did not give each other hugs after."
5,fantastic,"I am assuming that this DVD is the same collection of footage that was the Pay Per View a couple of years ago (according to the the song list, the songs are the exactly the same). If so, this is a ""Can't miss"" great show. All the intimacy of the Lilith Fair itself is present here and the filming is great too. If you've never heard the Indigo Girls, Jewel and Sarah sing ""The Water is Wide"" you are in for a true treat. Exceptional! I was forced to rate this or the review wouldn't print, so if the sound or video quality is not DVD standard, I apologize."
3,A Nice Suprise,"The reason I gave the rating I did , is because it is one of those live music Dvd's that you appreciate more each time you watch and listen to it . Various female singers . The opening song is great and also Jewel singing in the group . An all female live concert plus interviews . There is energy in it for sure . I am glad I bought it .A little different . An interesting one to add to your collection ."
4,heyyy laadiess,"i got this dvd and i think it is great. sound and video excellent. wouldve liked it to be longer with one more solo performance each from jewel and meredith brooks. especially meredith brooks. and where is lisa loeb? really where is she?shes in the artist clips between songs. yeah, also nice artist clips between songs. the girls look great in this dvd. so far next to my david gilmour dvd this is at the top. 2 from lisa and one more from meredith thats all i ask."
2,This is not The Persuasions I fell in love with,"This group was once one of the mose exciting forces on the American music scene. However, this CD is awful. There is no song on it that was not vastly better done by The Beatles. Instead of the group singing that once marked the Persuasions it is merely a lead singer singing everything at the same pace (one song is nearly indistinguishable from any other) with the other members of the group doing a little doo wop on the side. Boring! Buy the material by the original artists and enjoy some really good music. The Persuasions are now merely riding the coat tails of their earlier reputation."
4,Good performance. A little bit high price,"The card has good performance, although the installing process can be a little long and it is better to download the latest drivers. Also, I found (later) that Amazon's price is a litlle higher that other online stores."
5,The most perfect version of Mahler's First,"This recording of Mahler's First Symphony is simply amazing. Mahler's first is, for me, his best work and this is just the best recording. I have heard Solti's, Haitink's and Abbado's recordings and I can tell Bernstein with the Royal Concertgebouw is the best. The firs movement is fresh, the music just flows and keeps flowing softly until it gives a powerful conclusion.The second movement is a little bit slower than the other versions, but is energic as well as joyfull. The third movement is a little bit fast for a funeral march but it really takes you through the feeling of death and takes you back for the final movement.The fourth movement starts with such a sonority that makes you think your speakers are going to explode. This is certainly the best part of the recording, with every single instrument creating just the perfect sound until the not less powerfull ending.If you like Mahler, this recording is for you."
2,"Excuse me, may I use your bathroom...?","Bernstein's ugly and unimaginatively blatant reading of this favourite Mahler symphony, gloriously performed by the Concertgebouw in a recording that reeks of TV, has long been a prime recommendation.Personally, I find Walter or Kubelik express a, for me, far more authentic 'Viennese' quality in this music, more of a paen to nature and the creative force than Bernstein's slobbering glitz of vainly searched-for neurosis.Still, I'm clearly outnumbered here, so I leave you to make your own decision."
5,Drop-dead hilarious and true-to-life,Justin Locke writes about experiences most professional musicians have had with such glee that I am sad that I almost finished with it. It is amazing how he takes many simple situations and gives us his hilarious take on what is really happening. This book will be given to many of my musician friends as there is nothing like it.
4,Cute variation,"This story is a cute variation of The Gingerbread Man with a Spanish twist. My students enjoy reading the story and comparing it to The Gingerbread Man. My only problem with this book is the use of the traditional name for a donkey. It makes it hard to share with children because they don't understand that that word has another meaning. I wish the author had just used ""donkey"". Cute illustrations too!"
4,much better than other non-Russian,"I must differ to the previous opinion. Russian of the main singers is bearable enough, especially comparing to the Solti interpretation that sounds really strange. I mean pretty strange conducting, strange choose for the singers, and dreadful, unprofessionally sounding Russian. I can point out just two strong points of that interpretation, which are Giaurov as Gremin and thorough booklet. Otherwise Levine's CD is fine. Probably, Freni is the best Tatiana recorded ever, Shikoff is fabulous (just compare with Burrows!), Levine conducts agreeably, and the record is beautifully scaled. Anyway, I'd prefer entirely Russian interpretation. I am sorry about that."
3,good,"A very good performance from all but to me the Solti version is number one. Stuart Burrows as Lensky is melting. His aria makes me cry every time. Nothing compares.I must admit to buying it to see if I felt the same but it didn't quite hit the note for me. Nevertheless,it is good, but not quite what I wanted to hear."
3,The Reich stuff,"THE YESTERDAY MACHINE is an intentionally campy film sure to amuse all fans of vintage low budget quickie sci-fi. It's about a post-WWII German physicist (Jack Herman in an over-the-top-of-Mt.-Everest performance) who has --big-- plans. From his laboratory hidden in a Dallas area farmhouse, Prof. von Hauser hopes to restore Der Führer by conquering the 4th dimension! Meanwhile, he kidnaps a high school majorette just before the big game and the cops come looking for her.For an extra large helping of spaced out limburger, try VCI'sSCI-FI DOUBLE FEATURE: TIME WARP/WARP SPEED(featuring Adam West!).Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 viewer poll rating found at a film resource website.(3.0) The Yesterday Machine (1963) - Tim Holt/James Britton/Jack Herman/Ann Pellegrino/Charles Young"
5,LOVE IT!!,Just got these in the mail yesterday. Already have my craft desk all organized!! I love it. totally great product.
1,not as pictured,"I had the impression from the image shown that this organizer was a medium finish, like the bamboo organizers I've seen at many home stores. However, this was actually a very light colored and lightweight, unfinished wood. It did not seem sturdy, and I sent it back."
3,"Decent organizer, not finished wood","Listen to other reviews here, it is not a finished wood product. It is sanded, but could use a stain or lacquer. The drawer has some kind of locking feature that allows you to open it up and lock in p lace every 1"" to 1/2"" or so. It does leave a space at the bottom of the drawer between the 2 halves, you can solve this with some silicone if it bothers you. Worked to clean up our drawer so I like it, but the description says finished which it is not."
3,It's fine.,"Does its job. I bought a lightly used one and think the price was fair. Full price is likely too much. By the way, the wood of the organizer is sanded but not primed or otherwise painted."
5,still hard to beat,"These performances were originally made in 1965 and 1966, and still sound amazingly good today. The digital remastering enhances what was already very fine sound. This La Mer is even better than Karajan's later account on EMI (which is a shade too hard-driven) and the equal of any other in the catalogue. The combination of sensuousity and discipline, along with practically flawless playing, produced magical results here. It is a real pity that Karajan did not record the entire Daphnis et Chloe ballet, as his Suite No. 2 was also one of the very best. Karlheinz Zoller's solo flute contribution in the Prelude a l'apres-midi d'un faune is outstanding. The Bolero is also well done. Taken as a whole, this remains a remarkable disc. Strongly recommended."
2,"Too loud and too quiet, a nightmare on tile floors",It was such a dissapointment to get this cd after all the good reviews. The range of this recording is too broad. There are moments when there is barely any sound and then MEGA loud. I have heard other recordings of Bolero that weren't so extreme. I'll keep searching.
5,I love it,"What is there not to like to the Tokyopop's translation of Saiyuki Reload? Loaded with creative funny one liners that never repeats (unlike the Japanese version)and reminds me a lot of the English dub of the ADV Gensomaden Saiyuki.The only con is, sometimes Tokyopop doesn't fill in a word balloon and the quality is crappy compare to the Japanese version but hey is cheap."
1,What happened.,"Let me sum up my feelings.Draco, 4 StarsChaos Child, WTF, no way this book deserves any consideration.I have never posted any review. I was so thoroughly disappointed in this book it makes me somewhat tenative to purchase another 40K book ..... Like Draco I need to be illuminated, I geuss I will just have to read the Eisenhorn Trilogy again."
2,Do not bother wasting your money,I will keep it short and very un-sweet. The first book in this trilogy is awesome. The second book was so-so and naturally I thought the final book of the trilogy would boost the worthiness of reading the second book. I got to a point when reading this book that I just wanted to discard it and move onto something better. I do not expect spectacular dialogue or likeable characters from the Warhammer universe because it is a very dark and depressing atmosphere. This book made Watsons work with that horrible A.I. flick seem genius. My greatest problem with the book is that none of the storylines from the trilogy come to a conclusion. I am not going to put up spoilers.My suggestion is to read Jaq Draco(First book) and be happy with how that one ends and forget the other two were ever made.
1,Warning warning - don't buy this book. Warning warning.,"Warning warning - don't buy this book. Warning warning. Donate your money to a worthy charity. On no account buy this book. Ostensibly written by Ian Watson who did such a astonishingly marvellous job with ''INQUISITOR'' (the 1st in this trilogy), ''Chaos Child'' (the 3rd book in this trilogy) does not have any meaningful plot, no action to speak of, no logical sequencing, just utter, utter inexplicable confusion. Its as if Ian Watson commissioned a ghost-writer who is unfamiliar with the rich and baroquely complex WH40K universe, then did nothing but proof-read spelling errors and lent his name to the titlepage. An utter utter waste of time and money for the reader. This is the first book EVER that I have reviewed that I use the term execrable. Its not even so bad that - sometimes - it became good. Its just bad. Avoid it like the plague. Ian, what happened??? I wished to give it ZERO star but was not allowed to do so by this website. B-("
3,and so it ends.,"After this series started out with the excellent Draco and then onto the above average Harlequin, Chaos Child is very disappointing. Nothing in this book was extraordinary, the plot, the characters, nothing. There are interesting things that do happen but they're barely covered while relatively mundane events receive top notch coverage. All of the subplots, the intrigue, everything is abandoned except Jaq's personal quest. Half of the time this book seems to be rushing to finish and then it feels like it's dragging it's feet just to extend the book. Horrible job, the only reason this gets 3 stars is because it finished Jaq Draco's story."
4,1001 Arabian Nights for the Thinking Person,"I prefer puzzle games to first-person shooters. I like to use my brain rather than my reflexes. I found the plot of Prophet and Assassin to be compelling. It was rewarding to help the desert bandit, As-Sayif, turn into a tragic hero.This game seems to be orignally designed as two separate collections of Arabian adventures. While I had a few technical problems with the sound during the animated sequences, the game gave me many enjoyable hours of gameplay. Sometimes it's the plot and not the interface that matters. For this price, the Prophet and the Assassin is a steal."
1,BEWARE - another arxel tribe piece of junk,"as a warning -- this is an arxel tribe product. dreamcatcher hides this fact by placing his logo (a very small logo) on the bottom of the box, where most people never look. if you like games by him, enjoy. the vast majority of people who i've talked to don't like his games and won't buy them. usually, you can spot the designer logo on the front of a box. the fact that they put it on the bottom indicates that maybe publisher is trying to hide it ?????"
5,Best of The Many Requiem Versions,"I'll keep this brief. This performance of Mozart's K.V. 626 Requiem Mass is powerful, moving, uplifting and sombre at the same time.I particularly love this version because of the ""Lacrimosa"" performance. Most composers rush through this simple piece, but this orchestra plays it slowly, as it is meant to be, funereal. Close to perfect!"
3,Tastes like Chicken.,"I've heard multiple life performances and recordings of this masterpiece as listener and as performer. Make sure you understand that the title of this CD is ""Mozart's Requiem by Franz Beyer"". This recording is to Mozart's Requiem as 8 track tapes to audio and Beta tapes to video.Here are my ratings based on a good professional knowledge of this particular music score:Orchestral performance - 5 starsChoir performance - 5 starsOrchestra soloists - 4 starsChoir soloists - 3.0 starsDigital recording, balance, Etc... - 3 starsFollowing original composer's score (music, tempo, balance, solo, Etc...) - 1 starThis recording is not for those of you who like to hear original Mozart and, may be, a little Sussmayr :-). And it is not for most professionals who shall notice horrible arrangement by Franz Beyer.Tastes like ChickenThank you, friends."
1,"Musically good, but recording quality is horrid.","I like the ""Chant"" CD from the Benedictine Monks and thought this might be along the same lines. Musically it is, it has that same wonderful tonality and the sound of the voices is just as delightful - assuming you can get over the recording itself.It sounds to me like someone made a CD from and old abused vinyl record using a very bad pickup cartridge which mistracks and distorts the loud high frequencies. The distortions are UNBEARABLE to the point that I could not even stand to finish listening to the CD.I know it is only $4.00 but if you buy this, be sure to play it on a really lousy player, this way the recording defects will be masked by the playback defects. If you have a good stereo or good headphones, forget it."
3,Good introduction to complex systems - Maybe a little dated?,"This was a very good look at the complexities of modern technology although the analysis and conclusions could be just as valid for any complex system. The issue I see with the book is that the information seems to be dated. There are a number of places where the author draws conclusions based on a lack of experience, technology operating hours, with the systems involved that may or may not be valid based on today's experience. It would be very interesting to see an update to determine if some of his assumptions are correct. If you are looking for an introduction to how portions of complex systems may interact in unpredictable ways, this is a good starting place."
4,A central text of sociology and business,"Perrow sets out a framework for thinking about the causes of 'normal' i.e. unpreventable accidents by looking at the coupling of features in a system and then overlays the potential severity of a failure to draw conclusions about the real reasons for catastrophes beyond the often useless explanations of user error and acts of God. This is a book that is more often quoted than read, which is a pity as it is well written and thoughtful, though the final attacks on social power relations are a bit over the top."
2,System safety is not an inexact science,"I must say that I do agree with the words of David Nightengale (Saint Paul, MN) that ""If you want to know about accident prevention go to the System Safety Society"".The book talks a lot on tight coupling, or dependence, of different parts of systems during different states (DEPOSE, design, equipment, procedures, operators, supplies and materials, and environment), but it all remains very qualitative. Safety and reliability engineers prefer quantitative approaches, which are abundantly available in the area of systems reliability.The author does have an attractive style of writing. Especially the presentation on dam failures (the Grand Teton, the Malpasset and Vaiont dam failures) was interesting to read."
5,Normal accidents book,"Normal Accidents: Living with High-Risk Technologiesthis is not light reading and is not a novel, it is non fiction but if you are interested in the one original review about why planes crash, nuclear reactors break, or modern technology complicated by humans this would be the best book i can recommend. It is long out of print and not new at all, but it is most relevant. I have purchased for my job, but liked it enough to buy one for myself."
2,Good Sociologists Should Not Dabble in Engineering,"Perrow regurgitated too many facts. Give us enlightenment. Give us a view of system safety we have not seen before. Give us substantial information by which we can make decisions. Present us with critical analysis about what engineering and operational safety processes work and what do not work. Don't regurgitate history to us. We can get it elsewhere. It is a good summary for historians on accidents, but its not good for those in positions who can make systems safer. If you want to know about accident prevention go to the System Safety Society."
3,Only if you HAVE to read it....,"This book was extremely informative for anyone that might enjoy the economic history of Europe. For those that are reading it because you HAVE to; expect for the reading to go slow and to have to re-read certain areas. Jones could have said the same things with words half as long with half as many pages! In all fairness to the author, I read this only because it was mandatory for a college economics class; not because it is a topic I typically enjoy."
4,Sherlock Holmes mixed with Sci Fi- Way ahead of its time,"Exit Sherlock Holmes was the first Non-Doyle Sherlock Holmes book I ever read, so I naturally have fond memories of it. However, reading it again I was surprised at how well it held up after all those years.The villain is Moriarty, but not the Moriarty you'd expect. Watson points out that the only other time he saw the Professor was on the back of a speeding train and he didn't get a good look at him. That becomes very important in this novel.I could tell you more but it would give away major plot points. Let me say that this book is more relevant today than it was in the seventies, when it was written. Mister Hall did a great job using Watson's ""voice"" and Doctor Doyles style of writing, something missing from many Holmes stories of late.Return to 1895, where people are not what they've seemed to be and others are not who they've claimed to be. You'll be glad you did!"
4,Entertaining little pastiche,"Watson uncovers Sherlock Holmes' incredible lifelong secret. All I can say is that it involves another great writer of fiction. A fun read, what one expects from Sherlock Holmes pastiches."
2,Very dilute,Used the last of my Turtle Wax car wash soap and replaced it with this. At the time I purchased this Gunk wash the price was $8.99 with shipping. Now is $15+. Bottom line I need to use about 3X the amount of this car wash as the older turtle was and I still do not get good oil/debris cleaning. Probably has to do with required reformulation (due to environmental issues) between 2006 and 2010 but in the end I might just as well use cheaper detergent.
4,Good Video,"DMX is sick and Meth and Red were awsome too. It was crazy seein Methodman and Redman perform flyin though the sky kickin off their Timbs. Pain in tha ass was some funnt sh*t too doin his Tony Montana Impression Eatin a sandwich. This DVD is worth watchin, peace"
5,Fantastic kid's movie! But where the hell's the DVD?,"I first saw John the Fearless in my grandfather's video store. I was a little kid and I decided to pop it in and watch it. I was impressed and I even got some good chuckles out of it. The sequence where the one man talks to John about the monster the Kluuda, his backstory, still gives me chills down my spine. The monster was designed pretty well and the story was very unique. Overall the movie was very well done but the one regret I have is that there is no DVD release. I think this movie needs to come out ASAP. It is a classic and I let my stepfather watch it (his name's John by the way) and he got a good laugh out of it. Come on you gotta love the supposed tough guys gang up on John and yet he still takes them all out. Overall my final verdict is to see this movie and own it if you can. As for the DVD, PUT IT OUT ASAP!"
3,Quantaray - QT-10 Pocket Tripod Great Product but it smells,I purchased this product for my Canon SD700IS. It's a great little tripod and works well. The only issue I have with it is the rubber feet give off a terrible odor that occasionally makes me nauseous. My parents could smell it from my jacket pocket the other night at dinner. Maybe they aren't all that way. I plan to check another camera store to see if I purchased one with a bad batch of rubber.
4,The Worm turns,"The grossed out alien creature is most reminiscent of Dune's worm, and Rhys reaction to discovering Torchwood is priceless. Will amnesia pills help?"
5,I am in Love with a certain Captain and a Doctor,"So it's only natural that BOTH shows (Doctor Who and Torchwood) make it to a reviewer's MUST HAVE list. Torchwood is so original and funny that it's something that ANY True Sci-Fi Fan Must see! If you rearrange the letters... well you'll see.Anyway, This is a must see series, Not only are the characters and the players attractive and funny and smart and broken and sad and at times they ALL seem as unreal as ""TorchWood"" itself that you can't look away. You DON'T want to. I am crossing my fingers that after ""Children of Earth"" they give us loyal and rabid fans everywhere even MORE!"
5,must have for Doctor Who and Torchwood fans,"If you are already a Torchwood fan...its a must own. Nuff said. Yeah, you can see it on cable, but if you purchase it it supports the rather underfunded BBC and helps to insure the future of Torchwood.If you are a Doctor Who fan, over the age of 16 (or 18 if your parents are uptight) then Torchwood is FANTASTIC. Captain Jack is back and better than ever! Eye Candy abounds!(if you are under 16, perhaps Sarah Jane Adventures is the way to go for you...)"
4,Torchwood Season 2,This was very good...But it could have been even better if the writers did not like killing people off so much.
3,More hysteria than mystery,"The first season was brilliant with clever plots, good acting and really interesting characters. The problems lies with the unfortunate ubiquitous ""humanizing"" of heroes - a common problem for all SF/fantasy/horros TV series. The writers start introducing more emotions, more love lines, more siblings problems and suffering and move from ""the city and the monsters"" show (which is interesting) into the ""sex, city and a bit of monsters - when we have time for them"". The overly rich emotional life of the heroes just bores to death. As much as I loved the first season, I am not sure even if I want to watch the ""children of earth"" - if it continues in the same direction. If anyone knows a good urban SF show that does not slide into the countless close ups of faces ""ravaged by tears of grief"", please give a hint. What happened to the authors sense of humor?"
5,torchwood second season,Enjoyed the torchwood series and wanted the dvd's so I could watch it again. This item arrived in good condition and would buy from this vendor again.Clarence
2,disappointing,I found it sad that the promise held by the first season turned into same old predictable plots and and sleepy acting
5,GREAT,THIS IS AS GOOD AS THE FIRST SEASON - IT IS WORTH BUYING THE DVD JUST TO NOT GET THE COMMERICALS.
1,"duh, over done","The second season gets predictable. Nothing subtle or suspenseful. Man kissing man lends nothing to the story, its just there for shock value. People really like this season? Nuts.Worse is the quality of the reporduction on the discs. There are spots, physical flaws, on the discs and I missed parts of the show.And why on Earth does BBC have to put the theme song and clip of the cast walking along in front of every episode? Very annoying. If there is a third season I will not buy it."
5,More Brit goodness,"Ok, so if you're looking at this product and you haven't watched season 1, STOP IT. Go look atseason 1. Don't start here.If you've watched season 1, and are still on the fence about liking Torchwood, or worse yet,you DIDN'T like season 1, this set isn't likely to change your mind about anything.It'll be more of the same stuff that you aren't sure if you like or not. Or that you don't like.If you've seen season 1, watched every Captain Jack appearence in Dr Who, and love it then gettingthis season is a no brainer. It's more of the good stuff you're expecting.If you don't fall into one of these 3 groupings. Think about it some more. Because you do."
1,SAD PC SHOW,Torchwood was a good concept based off Doctor who. But sadly it does not live up to it. This show clearly has an agenda. Trying to make something not normal seem normal. An agenda that no one wants to see nor care for. Captain Jack is a great character that is wasted because of this agenda. Its a dark dismal sci fi program. The agenda leads to many disturbing scenes not needed to see nor wanted to see. Its not Doctor who. If you want a tru sci fi spin off get the Sarah Jane adventures
3,London Sexy Zombie Police Story Continuing Fight,"A continuing modern TV story of ""good zombies"" of London-based Torchwood police force team fighting aliens and other supernatural creatures accomplishes to date five parts, of which this Second Season is less impressive than the First.As accustomed in nowadays visual works, sex possesses a particular part in actions: a Torchwood leader is a homosexual character and some other team members are bi-sexual."
1,Torch-ER-wood STINKS,"Jack should get back on Dr. Who where he belongs.My girlfriend and I were STUNNED with this series from Mr. Davies.Whats with all the silly situational sexual stuff?My girlfriend and I like sex too but we came here for adventure.The sex stuff makes the characters look STUPID.Here's one more ""S"" word about this train wreck....STINKS.One episode was ok called Countrycide....but OMG they somehow got their clothes off in the end. WHICH ACTUALLY TURNED US OFF! hahaBecause we kept saying to each other...Do WE look this stupid too???? ahahhaah"
5,Excellent,"Had an especial problem with this saga because of the openly gay John Barrowman. Being gay myself, I rarely buy or watch gay movies, etc. But boy was I surprised how tastefully the gay aspect was written into the stories. Congratulations to John Barrowman --- he reminds me a bit of a young Mark Harmon. I also like the fact that on his website he tells fans to please avoid sending him letters, etc., that are too ""vivid"" or explicit inasmuch as he has younger nieces and nephews that also would be reading the mail he receives --- that was a first for me --- kudos to him --- I hope he stars in a lot more movies both for television and film. The stories are well done, the special effects are very good --- and don't let the fact that he's gay put you off from buying these seasons because it's all well done -- nothing whatsoever to be embarrassed about..."
2,Could have left the gay stuff out.,"It's a shame that Captain Jack has to be gay. He has a big kissing embrace with the actor from the Buffy series. The scene is not appropriate for young viewers. Sorry, but that is MY opinion. Just as you have a right to your opinion, I have a right to mine.I love the Torchwood series. I just hate the blatant tones of homosexuality in a view episodes. Otherwise, I would give the show five stars."
4,Great Lens,This is an awesome lens. I bought it to replace the crappy lens that came with the digital rebel xt. It really is great. Sharp autofocus and great aperture range. This is perfect for what I do(astrophotography). The only reason i gave it four staars was that the autofocus can be a little sluggish but you can hardly notice it. Great value for a great lens.
4,Great beginners lens,"This is a great beginners lens. This is the lens that I learned to take actual pictures on. Not just that point and shoot stuff. It is a very well priced item, and for the price I think it is a great lens to have if you are not a professional. This is the only lens that I have on my camera (A Nikon D80). And the only thing that I don't like about it is sometimes it doesn't focus as sharply as other lenses that I have used. I should also mention that I like that this lens worked perfectly with both my Nikon D80 DSLR, and my Nikon N60 SLR. I almost never use the Auto focus, but when I do, it is pretty noisy and can be kind of slow. But I do not consider this a con because I do not use the Auto focus enough. I use this lens for everything. It is AWESOME for telephoto but it lacks a little bit in closer range pictures. That is why I would consider getting a Nikkor 18mm or something to couple this lens with. However I would recommend this lens to anyone."
4,Great Lens,"This is by no means a pro lens, but its no slouch. It destroys my sigma 70-300 when you compare them side by side at 200mm. It may get lens creep if you hold it up or down, but thats not really problem because the autofocus is so quick and I can hold the zoom ring with my finger. Good lens for the price, defiantly better than the cheap ""name brand"" lenses from Sony, Cannon, or Nikon."
1,"Sorry Peter, it just wasn't meant to be.","I am a huge fan of Peter Reckell on DAYS but there's no way he can be a singer. I'm sure singing is one of his passions and I'd say keep on doing what makes ya happy...Just don't record a CD and try to market it. If anyone buys it, it's soley because he is a great actor on DAYS and the idea of him having a CD out seems cool but it doesn't sound cool at all. Sorry Peter, it just wasn't meant to be."
1,"Wonderful playing, pity about the conducting.","As all ways with this conductor, the music comes a distant second. And while most Italian opera survived Karajan's showmanship and superficiality. The music of Bruckner most often died a horrible death. Stay away from this monstrosity and re-visit your cherished Furtwangler."
1,pompous arrogance,"With the excellent recordings of this work by Celibidache, Solti not to mention Furtwangler (and many more: Giuliny, Tintner, Maazel..) there is simply no reason to sit down for an hour and listening to the phoney ramblings of Karajan, sorry Karajan fans - he simply cannot hold a candle to the masters mentioned above and this recording makes this point more clear than any other."
5,A great recording,"I would recommend this CD to anyone looking for an excellent recording of a great orchestra and conductor in this work. Once you know this symphony, try Furtwangler's historic CD. I've got to admit, Furtwangler gives me even more thrills than Karajan, and the recording's OK."
3,Not OEM,"Just installed. This new Beck Arnley rotor for the REAR wheels is missing two small threaded holes that are on the original rotors (pictured on competitive rotors) and were essential for pulling/removing the old rotors. If I didn't need the new ones now, I would have considered returning and exchanging for another mfr.. First set of rotors survived 125K miles of New Hampshire winters; hopefully these replacements will outlive the car and won't need to be replaced. If you drive aggessively and anticipate replacement, consider another manufacturer.The Beck Arnley FRONT rotors do have these threaded holes; why on the fronts and not on the rears?Unrelated to rotors but important: Amazon processing and free shipping perfect."
3,BAD PAN AND SCAN,"I bought this because I'd seen it on dish. It's fluff but fun, watered-down Oscar Wilde wannabe, but I love Colin Firth, so I wanted to add it to my collection. But I was REALLY disappointed that this is NOT wide screen, but a BAD pan and scan. It seems that this is the only version available. What a letdown."
4,relative values,for some light fun i think this pic is it and sophie thompson runs away with the show....
2,"Flimsy plot, mediocre acting with a few exceptions","I'm not sure what the intended plot was for this movie. William Baldwin and Jeanne Tripplehorn play a caricatures of American celebrity couples of the era. For a caricature to work, it has to be funny and I'm afraid these weren't amusing at all. Julie Andrews muddles through as the matriarch of a stately British family and she appears to merely walk through each scene and smile sedately. The more amusing performances were of Colin Firth, Stephen Fry and Sophie Thompson in their lesser roles. I'm afraid the movie would be a total loss if it weren't for their humorous antics. I was very disappointed."
3,Colin steals the show!,"I purchased this movie based on reviews I had previously read and of course to watch Colin Firth, the brilliant actor (haha). I think it's pretty much a mindless watch if you're looking just to veg out and have some fun. All the reviews are correct Colin Firth does not play Julie Andrews son but her outwardly gay hilarious nephew. William Baldwin and Jeanne Tripplehorn might as well have not been in this movie I was bored with them. Julie Andrews, Colin Firth, Sophie Thompson and I think Stephen Fry (whoever played the head butler) made this movie hilarious. I feel they deserved five stars for their parts. It's a fun watch!"
5,Relatively Good,"Miranda Frayle leaves her boyfriend for an English nobleman. When the two announce their engagement, the press has a field day. Some things don't change. Miranda was hiding her past because she feared that she would be discovered and dissed. She wanted more than what she had and that was fame and fortune. She really loves her movie star boyfriend he won't do.""Relative Values"" is a good movie to watch because it deals with family, social upbringing, and personal conflicts. Jeanne Tripplehorn does a great impression of a movie starlet and Colin Firth is superb in his performance as a gay nobleman."
3,Movie was OK. The DVD was not,"1. The DVD was a Region 2 format, so I had to use my laptop to view it. That info should not be buried down in the DVD description.2. The DVD would play almost to end then would hang, even after cleaning. I will have to take it to the local video rental place to have them ""polish"" it, to see if that will fix it.3 I liked the British actors, the Americans were flat."
1,Not for US DVD Viewers,"I have seen this movie but when I ordered it, it was not for US viewing this will not play on DVD's made in the US. But I did enjoy the movie"
3,An enjoyable little souflee,"I purchased this mostly because of Julie Andrews and Colin Firth. While the film is no classic, it is surely enjoyable. The big comic surprise here is Sophie Thompson (Emma's sister). She is outrageously funny throughout the film, but especially when she's tipsy (during the main party scenes.) A fun 90 minutes. And by the way- did I mention it features the always divine Dame Julie?!"
3,This Film Turned Noel Coward Over in His Grave,"The Americans cast in this are awful. The English cast is better but the actor who plays Julie Andrews' son comes off as a gay man playing straight and the incredibly sexy and desirable Colin Firth is frittering away good film playing a raving queen, though as always he does it fabulously. Firth's excitement over the Billy Baldwin character is hilarious."
3,Disappointed with shipping care,"The packaging was compromised when it arrived and when the recipient oped it on Christmas, the pie plate was chipped. The damage was tiny and my son said it would be all right, but someone should have done a better job. The set was exactly as advertised except or this small thing. It was just what my son needed to start his kitchen. (He bakes cheesecakes!)"
2,Disappointing read,"The plot seems circular and the book mostly consists of the narrator speaking to herself. Some relationships are never fully explained and some plot points are confusing. Considering that this is not usually the kind of book I'd normally read, I assume other people might enjoy the story, but personally, I couldn't stomach most of the book."
4,Assorted Plastic Acquarium Plants,"These arrived promptly, packaged to ship without damage. They are pretty good quality for the price. The size assortment is nice to add variety to the tank. A great way to add decor."
5,perfect,"plants look great in my tank. the different heights are perfect, you can always take each one apart and connect them yourself to desired length. shipping was fast, arrived 3 days before expected date, only down side is plants were slightly bent out of shape but i can live with that. when/if i find out how to add a photo i shall. will defiantly purchase from seller again."
3,"Wrong book, my fault","I haven't read it because it was the wrong book. That was my mistake because I suffer from a loss of some eyesight in one eye. Because of other medical requirements, I simply laid it aside. What I wanted was the book by the same title, only it was titled......for effectove PERSONS. Too late now to return it so haven't pursued acquiring the right book I originally wanted."
2,just okay,I chose this book to read for class and found it somewhat wordy. The book spends too much time on examples and could easily be condensed to be more specific and straightforward for the reader. The lessons learned are helpful for those starting a family however if you are just reading for a class or enjoyment it is not worth the time.
3,Book Review,I personally have not read this book so I wouldn't know how good it is but my wife told me she didn't like it to much.
5,Awesome book,Borrowed this book from the library and had to purchase a copy for our family. Many good ideas and encouragement. Our family has used some of the ideas and we see good changes.
5,The Best Motivational Book ont he Market!,"This is definitely a cult book in the working world. I use this daily as a pick-me-up and recommend it to everyone I meet. This book is a keeper and must become part of everyone's library. Never has there been a book that hits all aspects of a person's llife with a central focus on family except the Bible. And if my mom read it and raved about the content, that gets a big star from me!"
4,Better than the original 7 Habits,"This is far more applicable than the original 7 habits book. The family setting is one of the best for applying the Covey principles, and this book helped me understand the 7 habits and give ideas on how to practice them in my family setting. I would recommend this book to both those who have strong families and those who would like to have strong families. Read it together."
2,Rating my purchases,"Some items are 4 stars, great items. Others rated less than 2 stars are not good products. I enjoyed shopping with Amazon."
5,Life Changing,"Some of this is just common sense. But some of this was life changing for my family.The chapters in this book build upon themselves and as they grow they develop the theme of families being worth the effort. There are stories of real life situations, quotes, examples and more.One chapter is about making a plan and making a statement. And while I know this is based on a business type mode, we tried it. We made a Family Statement and it has been a large part of our lives. My children will recite it and use it as a reminder of what we expect of them.It is a great book. One that will have a place on my bookshelves for many years to come."
4,Helpful information,"This book is informative and would make a great resource for any family eager to improve their communication and family involvement. Gets a bit wordy after awhile and there are lots of testimonials touting Covey's other books, but overall this was a well-written & informative read."
5,Want to read again,I read this book or rather skimmed it for a school project. It changed my life and my family's. It is great!!! Its interesting and he is right on the money. I too wondered how good a parent he could be traveling all the time but if you read the book he takes a child with him often giving him time one on one. I want to buy it and read it again so I can highlight all the things that mean something to me!
4,Excellent ideas.,"Gives plenty of 'food for thought' and helps you really look at your family in a new way. The ideas can help you improve family life. It does require some thinking to figure out how exactly to make these ideas work for you, as it gives more of a blueprint or concept to work from. I'd compliment this book with a 'plain-talk' parenting guiide such as Elizabeth Pantley's Perfect Parenting Dictionary for daily real-world answers."
3,A Bit Too Sappy For Me,"While this book had some good insights and ""a-ha"" moments, it was too sappy for me to get past the third chapter. I enjoy a good metaphor for life as much as the next person, but there were so many in this book that the author's real messages got clouded by them. I much prefered Family First by Dr. Phil McGraw."
4,The 7 Habits of highly effective families,"There are pretty good ideas in this book.However not as good as ""The 7 Habits of highly effective people"""
3,Worked well for a while,"But now it no longer functions. Also, the description says it includes a power adapter but it does not."
2,Why are Alburt's books so hard to follow?,"I read three of his, including this one. The Pirc, for the benefit of the doubt, is so advanced that I could not understand. The Rules of Thumb, so general that I could find from other books. This book, only the first thin section is about Fischer, the rest is like a condensed version of chess magazines. It takes only 10 minutes to read all about Fischer in this book. I recommend the Gufeld's book about Fischer, deeper, more stories and games of Fischer's."
4,"Thoughtful, Practical Reading","When I first started into this book I had a bad attitude because I felt I was being forced to adopt a program that just meant more work for me, with little return benefit. As I got into the book, my feelings gradually changed and I began to appreciate the entire structure of this framework. This book will help anyone who teaches anything, but will be especially helpful if adopted by an entire faculty."
3,Theory,"Good for learning theory of teaching, but an experienced teacher went through this book and found about two pages of information that are actually useful in the classroom."
4,"""An Effective Resource For Teacher Training""","Charlotte Danielson has done a fine job putting together a concise framework from which beginning teachers can rely. Though presented in a formal, less conversational manner, Danielson had tidily structured the essential components necessary for an effective teacher. I especially applaud Danielson on Domain 2: ""The Classroom Environment"", often neglected in current effective teaching research, and Domain 4: ""Professional Responsibilities"", never properly treated in teacher induction programs (TIPS).I strongly recommend this text as both a resource for teacher trainers and for those just entering the field of education. Go beyond the ever present research acknowledgments and you'll find the heart of effective teaching."
4,good product for these times,"I have used the Braun food processor for years but could no longer replace the disc carrier, which breaks often. So I went searching and this seemed a reasonable next generation/price. So far I like it ok. One of my favorite uses is to grate fresh parmesan; this process leaves something to be desired--more small chunks than good grating of hard cheese. Will keep working on it. Good pulse performance; good pesto results; good pastry mixing."
5,Works Great!,I checked out a lot of reviews on various websites and asked my friends about their experiences with food processors before deciding on this model. I'm very happy with my choice. It works great and I love how quiet it is when operating. The small size is great for my family. Be careful not to fill it too high with liquids they will spill out during processing. Since the processor is not very large I have not yet used the mini bowl. Best of all... you can put all the pieces (except the base) in the dishwasher for easy clean up!
1,Bowl Broke Replacement is 60 dollars,"I have had this product for about a year. gentle use, marinades, the bowl broke while in use, marinade all over the counter. I would not recommend. Others have posted they have had to replace the bowl often. I expected more for the price."
2,Disappointing...never buy based on brand name,"We have the Kitchen Aide mixer. It is solid, will built and works well so we thought the food processor would be the same quality.....boy were we wrong. The bowel and lid are made of cheap plastic and already we have had to replace the bowel twice because it keeps breaking. My wife is fed up with this thing. I got this for her less than a year ago. Don't be fooled it is not the same quality as the mixer! I remember deciding between this one and the Cuisinart and went with the Kitchen Aide based on the reviews and the quality of the mixer. Big mistake. If you are deciding between the two, get the Cuisinart. I will say Kitchen Aide has replaced the bowel both times without toooo much hassle but the customer service representative said you have to be careful when you handle the bowel. So I guess you need a surgeon's touch to use this thing. Two stars pending delivery of the 2nd cup."
3,Good for small meals,"This works great for small recipes and small families, its not really high powered like the more expensive larger kitchenaide food processors, this is perfect for tomatoes, zucchni shredding, I recommend if you dont cook massive amounts, I will need a larger one for my needs, as I replaced one much bigger and didnt realize that until I bought this one..still can do the job for small amounts"
5,Do I ever love this food processor!,"This food processor is quiet, fast, easy to clean ... I received this as a Christmas present and it's now my favorite kitchen appliance."
5,Love It!,"I've been needing a new Food processor for awhile now. I love this one. It's not too big, stores away nicely. It seems very durable."
4,It has a home on my counter,"I've been enjoying my food processor over the past few weeks. I've been using it to dice, slice, puree, shred, blend, etc. It is very powerful and not too loud. It does a great job with purees and blending. It is a little too powerful for dicing. Onions and such get pulverized by the time all the pieces are contacted by the blade. The pulse feature helps somewhat, and small batches help also. It slices well, but the slices are very thin. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and plan to use it at least a few times a week."
3,Good processor with questionable build quality,"I had this processor for about 8 months in which time it worked great. I used it on a regular basis and it does exactly what you'd expect. The base is heavy and of good build quality. However, after 8 months the 7 cup bowl's handle broke, rendering the processor useless. How the handle broke was a mystery, because it hadn't been dropped or knocked. While looking to order a replacement I discovered that the handle breaking is a known issue with this processor and many people were complaining about it. The good news is that Kitchen Aid's customer service was great and sent a replacement out straight away, I didn't even have to send the old one back. So far this one has fared better, but if something is a known issue a long term fix should be in place and so far there isn't."
5,So far. so good. I like it a lot.,"Have had the Kitchen Aid KFP720OB 7-cup with 3-cup mini for ~2 mos., and I'm still learning, as it's my first food processor. The original small blade scored the sides of the mini bowl, but I called KA customer service, and both the blade and bowl were replaced immediately at no cost. KA even sent a postage label for returning the defective parts. I use both blades and both bowls almost daily but haven't used the slicing/shredding blade. The machine is quiet, powerful, doesn't move about on the counter, and everything is easy to clean (I have no dishwasher). The closest thing I have to a complaint is that the large bowl is a little difficult to remove. Perhaps I just haven't figured it out yet. All in all, I'm very happy with this processor. I think it does what it's supposed to do, and customer service was excellent."
5,Lovin' My First Ever Food Processor,"The closest I ever came to owning a food processor was a Salad Shooter (remember those?), which drove me nuts with the volume of parts to keep track of. As much as I'm not fond of hand-chopping food, I figured a knife was much easier to manage (and clean) than a food processor would be. I recently got a hankering, though, and began my research. Since there are just two of us, I knew I didn't need lots of bells and whistles, nor did I need or want a bunch of attachments, i.e. for breadmaking, etc. I wanted basic but quality, and this KitchenAid fits my requirements perfectly. It's solid, it's not ear-crushing noisy, and it does exactly what I need it to do quickly and without fuss. Chop stuff with a knife? What was I thinking? For the price, this is a great machine, and I would highly recommend it."
4,Just what I wanted!,"This processor is quick, smooth, and NOT loud (my husband can sleep through the noise when I use it in the morning, unlike our previous Cuisinart.) And it does everything I need it to do. I'm very satisfied with the product, and definitely recommend."
2,chef maria,"I own many KitchenAid appliances... this one is a piece of junk. I have only owned it for several months and the handle on the bowl has broken twice. KitchenAid replaced it both times, however, the second time (two weeks later)the service dept representative was very rude and refused to replace it. I told her that I wished to speak to the manager and only then was she willing to replace the part. I would not purchase this item!"
1,Not happy!,"I was very excited about the KitchenAid food processor as it would be my first processor, but after only three uses the thing stopped working. I have had a commercial KitchenAid mixer for twenty years but after this I will rethink buying another KitchenAid product."
5,My Wife is Very Happy with this Product,We got this food processor about 4 years ago and my wife has been very happy with it ever since.She has been able to do all that she wants with it. And she makes good use of it too.I know she would give it an excellent rating.
2,Good motor but expensive to replace the bowl!,"The handle has broken on the bowl. It must be in working order for the processor to work. It broke awhile ago and my husband was able to fix it. Now it has fallen apart and we found it is about $65.00 to replace it. We only spend $75.00 for it originally. Needless to say, I'm not very happy."
2,Missing Parts,"We bought this food processor as a Christmas gift. When my son and his girlfriend assembled it to prepare after-holiday goodies, it was missing the mini bowl, one of the features that makes it unique.We were able to contact the original manufacturer who mailed the part a week later.Now all works well and there are no complaints. (Makes a good pie crust with minimal effort)."
3,By an MIS person dealing with IDS 7.3 for the first time,"The book covers a lot of useful points. I was interested only in installing and configuring IDS 7.3 on both UNIX and Windows, and writing DML to create databases, tables, etc. The book covers generics pretty well, but not the differences between UNIX and Windows versions. I was able to install and configure IDS (making informed choices) after reading the book. Details on DML syntax was scattered throughout the book, without adequate index or cross-references entries to take you to the next syntax option you could specify. Some syntax options were missing. This book would benefit from better organization or stronger editing in this area. The book gave useful hints and procedures to follow after a few problems were encountered after users started to use IDS."
5,Best Irish Rock band next to U2!,"U2 is more rock than Irish. The Prodigals play up traditional Celtic music into rock. If you like Michael Flatley's ""Lord of the Dance"", you get the picture. ""Dreaming"" is their best CD to date, though ""Go On"" comes very close. These guys get bigger and better each time. The live shows are high energy rock concerts but without the obsenities and drugs, so they make great family events. They are, without doubt the next generation of Irish music. Buy the CD, crank up the volume, and enjoy!"
5,Great Jig Punk!,"I've seen the Prodigals several times live, and the mix of traditional and modern styles is at first a little befuddling, then completely addictive. Dreaming is their best cd yet (although Go On is great too). It's one of those cds that you put in and listen to all the way through.. you won't want to skip through this one. It's become my favorite album by far!"
5,The BEST,I've seen all of their concerts in persoon siince i was born. The band is the best. I like DREAMING IN HELL'S KITCHEN the BEST. These guys are so good. I would kill myself to have all of their cd's.
1,Scammed,I bought this item thinking it would be a full size seat cover like it shows in the picture. The picture is a full size bike it looks like a 125 or 250 Suzuki RM. The item description says Facotry Effex All-Grip Seat Cover. What they sent....KLX 110 seat cover. Thats a kids bike!!!! Thanks for ripping me off. I threw out the box and did not open it until I was read to assemble it waiting of seat foam to come in. So when I opened it up days later you can imagine how mad I was. So no invoice or box left I am now stuck with it and better be sure I will was waiting for the review to come out to write this.
5,Pure gold!!,"I think this is Schubert's best opera in many accounts. Inspired music throughout but a horrible libretto. Wonderful singers and orchestra under the baton of Claudio Abbado. A real must buy. But i do not like that several arias and choruses are lumped together in one track, they should have been divided into several."
4,Very Good Guide on Being a Competetive Distance Runner,"Maryt Liquori, the former 5000 meter Americam Holder and one of the great American Milers (he was in the thick of the race that first broke Jim Ryan's record), writes a very good guide on how to become competetively fit. He makes the comment that some runners try to improve by milage but quality is what makes you faster. That of course includes track work, speed and particularly intervals. I appreciated reading this while in my 30's Liqouri's comments that as an over 30 runner he found the need to run hard every three days versus every other day. It's important to know how fast your intervals are but Liqouri makes a good point, if you are not in shape, lay off the watch until you have made some progress. No need to discourage yourself. Works for older runners too, no watch that is. Very good coaching guide for high schoolers."
5,Very good halter,"My mom love this halter. It is comfortable for her horse, easy to use and really nice: good color, soft leather, gold parts are nice, without any dark points."
4,A bridge between theory and reality,"This book will be more useful to students of International Relations Theory than it will to the average person interested in foreign affairs. Reading the works of the grand theorists like Waltz, Keohane and Nye is kind of like geometry at time...you wonder how does this affect me in real life? Hulsman tries to make that connection.Hulsman outlines the major theories and then quantifies how real people (policymakers like Clinton, William Perry, Strobe Talbot, Congressmen like Joe Biden, etc.) show their leanings as neo-realists or institutionalists based on intiatives they have supported or voting records, for example.This is a fascinating book bridging the gap between theory and practice...and shows that International Relations Theory is not just a matter for academics to ponder on college campuses."
5,paradigm for the new world order,I meet John while in Washington D.C. on a school trip he was a fascinating man so I decided to read his book. Anyone who is interested on anything on foreign policy in Europe Read This Book. And John if you ever read this please feel free to email me and tell me what's new. Ken
4,This is a good beginner's guide.,"I went to the Fundamentals of SAS course held at the SAS Institute and was left in dire need of more information. This book was a first step. The exercises in the book were helpful and reinforcing. If you need more than brginner's knowledge, then you'll have to purchase another book but this is good to get started."
1,Not Helpful At All,"This book is the least helpful SAS book I've had. This was the first SAS book I used and was required to purchase it for a class. Since then I've been using SAS for about 6 years and this book has never helped answer any of my questions. There are far superior Introductory SAS books out there like SAS Programming by Example and The Little SAS Book, anything else that you need to know you would be better off searching for on the internet."
3,"For beginners, two books better than one","I suggest getting both a book like this, for its greater comprehensivity, combined with another one (like 'SAS programming By Example') for its more user friendly accessibility, if you are a beginner. Both books can be used as a starting text, and having two books can be better than one, and each one complements the other."
5,I am buying extra copies!!,"My 10 month old son loves this book! We recieved it as a ""hand-me-down"" from a cousin and my baby has worn it out! We are ordering a new one for us and another as a gift. The pages are tabbed so it is a good book for little ones to learn how to turn pages."
5,my 10 months old daughter loved it!,"It is a very nice and colorful book, my baby loves it! She gets so excited when she sees the babies and their expressions. I would recommend this book for the little ones :)"
2,Very tough on your stomach,"I was hoping i could take these pills instead of celebrex or NSAIDs but the recommended daily dose is 4 tablets which even when i take with food tears apart my stomach and leaves me with discomfort. I tried lowering the dose to just two, then even just one tablet and to my surprise it still upset my stomach. Perhaps this products will help if you don't have stomach problems but if you have a sensitive stomach then i would highly suggest you stay away from this one."
3,"Supposedly different than other westerns, it is just as good and just as bad as the average ones","This rather short 1954 western focuses on an episode during the Civil War, in 1864. The north is concerned that the Indians would be stirred up by the Confederacy and cause trouble for Union troops, and President Lincoln sends an emissary to establish peace with an Indian tribe by offering them peace, land, and $100,000 in gold. The Confederacy learns of the scheme and sends its spy, played by Gary Merrell, to take the place of Lincoln's emissary, promise the Indians what Lincoln wanted to promise, but give the Indians nothing, and bring the gold to help the Confederacy. The Confederacy expects that the Indians will think they were tricked and attack the whites of the local town. This will force the Union to sidetrack troops from battle grounds to help the local citizens. However, Gary Merrell is only interested in his own welfare, and this creates the drama."
3,Deserves 3 1/2 stars,"I'd give it 3 1/2 stars if I could. This is an odd but good one. The main star (Gary Merrill in a western?) is the bad guy and John Bromfield, who is the hero, doesn't get that much emphasis. But it all works. There's lots of riding and action in interesting western scenery. It's a South-stealing-Northern-gold-near-the-end-of-the-Civil-War story. Recommended."
1,never buy from dynadirect,"This item might be fine but I will never deal with dynadirect again. I was shipped a battery that didn't fit my camcorder. I contacted the company several times and was given the run around. The last message I got was something like ""we are decided if you can return this item""Horrible customer service!"
2,Save your money and your time.,"The only thing that kept me turning the pages of this book was the forlorn hope that THE END would appear on one of them. The story starts out well enough with Easy Rawlins, a high school janitor, agreeing to watch the little yellow dog of a popular teacher. Then the teacher's husband and brother-in-law turn up dead and she disappears. The plot and my interest thinned. Easy's principal goals seem to be solving this mystery and having sex with every woman he meets. Although why he wants to do either is more of a mystery. The latter would land him in jail, the former dead. Rather than titallating, it was annoying. Other than Easy, only the dog had some interesting character development, and even that was minor. I just couldn't care about any of the characters, the mystery, or how it was resolved."
5,I would like to know what happen to mouse.,In my opionion this is one of Walter Mosely best books he has ever written but I am wondering on the ending of the book because I am confuse on what happen... I am a very big fan of both Easy and Mouse in Mr. Mosely book's.
3,"Too Long a Story, Not Walter's Best Work","A Yellow Dog was just too long and drawn out. It started out okay. But trying to find the killer just got to be too long and boring. I think the killings should have taken place throughout the book. It seems most of them took place up front. It was getting on my nerves. I love the character Easy Rawlins, but does he have to sleep with every woman he meets? He kind of reminds me of Susan Lucci's character - Erica Cain on All My Children. This book was definitely not Walter's best work. I loved ""A Red Death"" and ""Black Betty"". Sorry Walter, you have done better. I never finished this book because it didn't keep my interest as the others. Maybe I'll try your latest one ""Gone Fishin""."
4,Miscaninthropic,"This is another book review by Wolfie and Kansas, the boonie dogs from Toto, Guam. Reviewing this book poses an ethical dilemma for us. How should a Jewish reviewer treat Shakespeare's ""The Merchant of Venice""? How should an African-American reviewer deal with Melville's ""Benito Cereno""? In this book, Mosley's normally admirable hero, Easy Rawlins, displays negative species-centric attitudes towards the title character, the little yellow dog. Except for this problem, this is a typical well-written Easy Rawlins mystery. The book is also redeemed somewhat by the fact that some of the characters have a more positive attitude than Rawlins towards the dog. Still, human dog-lovers seeking a mystery novel might be better off reading a less miscaninthropic book, such as Frederick Busch's ""Girls"""
4,Crazy,"A fun, crazy fast paced mystery. Characters - literately and figuratively well drawn out. Well thought out and written. Enjoyable for sure!"
1,Please spare me from this drivel!,"This is yet another example of an arrogant, prideful man trying to replace God's perfect plan with his own flawed one. There is only one God. He had only one son. It was necessary that His one and only son die as a sacrifice for our sins so that we might be reconciled with Him. It's a simple and beautiful plan that provides for the salvation of mankind. Anything else, such as the pop theology put forth in this book, are simply the pointless mutterings of man."
2,"Spong's final book fails to define the ""new Christianity""","As a former Episcopalian who has lapsed into a uncomfortable Atheism, I hoped that this last book by Bishop Spong would give some indication as to what a new Christianity might look like once most of the 39 Articles of Religion have been eliminated. Regretably, although Spong tells the reader, once again, why he has rejected such things as the resurrection, the virgin birth and the inerrancy of the bible, he concludes that the form and nature of the future church must be left to others. With all due respect to Bishop Spong, there is really no need to read this book unless you are unfamiliar with the Bishop's previous work, in which case ""A New Christianity"" provides a nice summary of his theology."
4,Afterlife?,"The book is excellent, however the Bishop completely avoids the subject of the afterlife -- although he notes that this theme is one of the most asked about in his public lectures, second only to prayer. This is a serious omission. I would venture to guess that Bishop Spong would say that there is an afterlife, and universal salvation is attained through reincarnations-- as Christ has not ""saved"" us, according to him, and he does include Eastern religions with their rebirths traditions in his new ""Ecclesia"". Just a thought. Does anybody agree or disagree with it? Bishop Spong, are you out there?"
1,Another failed attempt,"Folks like Spong have been trying to 'kill' christianity for over 2000 years, and it ain't happened yet! The truth is the truth and you can't make it something else. Scripture holds true no matter the season."
1,The Great Harlot of Mystery Babylon is Rising...,"I can now begin to see how the church is truly going to become a great Harlot Religion that the book of Revelation speaks of rising up in the last days. The world's religions uniting under one universal banner and more than likely will be centered in the city of Rome. The religion would of course be the climax of Mystery Babylonian practice that can be found in all religions throughout the world.1. Darkness2. Superstition3. Idolatry and ""Aids to Worship""4. Immorality5. Priesthood under a High Priest-Supreme PontiffIf you plan on reading this book and you are a Christian then you should be careful to not end up believing what this book has to say about religion. God is not simply Being itself. To say that is to simply glorify humanity and to elevate humanity to godhood."
1,Unbelievable !!! Read This Review !!!!,"You can't call yourself a Christain and divorce yourself form Christ, which is exactly what Spong has done. You can't justinvent a 'New Christianity'.... if Spong wants to do this he needs to disassociate his new cult from the God of the Bible and call it something else. This is the most ridiculous fraud being offered to the religious book buying crowd in quite some time.I couldn't recommend anyone buy this book."
4,Happy Customer,"Some internal notes in margins in biro, otherwise good and clean. Would Recommend dealer. Arrived slightly later than other copy.."
3,Disapointment - Book not Received,"As of today, Jan. 21, 2011, the book has still not been received. There have bee emails back and forth with no resolution."
1,The Book I Have Never Seen,"My opinion of this book is I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED IT, AND THEREFORE CANNOT GIVE IT A REIVIEW! Perhaps amazon can refund my money since the product was never sent to me. THis is the third time I have complained, and STILL I HAVE RECEIVED NO COMMENT FROM AMAZON---THEY ARE APPARENTLY NOT CONCERNED AT ALL WHEN ONE OF THEIR CUSTOMERS IS RIPPED OFF. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU SHOP ELSEWHERE."
1,Let's Get Serious!,"I find some of the positive reviews of this book downright amusing. One reviewer claims that those who disagree are ""close-minded"" while those who agree, are ""open-minded."" I would like to ask, ""Open minded about what? - error!"" John Spong, in his usual, polemic way, trashes anythng traditional while providing very little evidence for his position. Instead, he uses staw men type arguments. He will not allow the people of antiquity the priviledge to use anthropomorphic idoms, but of course, us more enlighten people can use them today.Spong's diatribe is old and was first introduced under the older mind sceince cults that grew out of the Enlightenment period. If you want true scholarship, read N.T. Wright or Luke Tomothy Johnson."
1,There He Goes Again - ZZZZzzzzzzz,"How many times and how many books must the Episcopal Church's resident athiest write to get out his point ... More of the same - ""Christ was a social activist, Christianity must ""let go"" of faith and the divine, divinity is primative superstition, liberalism is wonderful, homosexuality and free sex are OK"" .. Feel good social activism drivel from this Luther wanna-be diguised as scholarship. Absolutely nothing new or ""refreshing"" here ... same Spong - same message."
1,Not only wrong but foolish,"This book is ignorant and badly written. It is a rehashing of tired old fallacies exposed centuries ago. I am not a fundamentalist and indeed only a rather vague Christian, but I know tired rhetoric and fallacious argument when I see it. This book insults the reader's intelligence. Basically the author wants to keep the dignity and prestige of being a Christian bishop while denying and sneering at basic tenets ofChritianity. An outright atheist would be more worthy or respect."
5,New Christianity for a New World,"John Spong writes with passion and conviction which embrace the very depth of Christianiy for the modern times. He has been given the tools to lead all of us to a new and deeper relationship with the Christ we have known,and to the realistic Christ we have been searching for. We have the opportunity to have a more united world for all faiths in the future, and hopefully, we will be able to enjoy more peacefull lives for all man kind with the use of his wisdom."
1,The man is a kook,"It's rare for new religions to be created out of whole cloth, but it's a goal that JS Spong seems to be striving towards. For centuries, the two central tenants of Christianity have been that Christ was God and that Christ died for sin. Spong believes neither of these, and thus his ""New Christianity"" is completely void of anything that Christianity has been for 2000 years. As a result, Spong's view is decidedly new-age and more resembing pop-psychology than a real delving into hard questions about the Christian faith."
1,Wandering in the wilderness,"Spong continues to deny the truth in orthodox Christianity and blatantly misleads readers into thinking that God must change to fit our culture.I recommend, Can Man Live Without God by Ravi Zacharias--a close look at the problems with Christianity, but why it is still the only good option."
1,Plain and Simple,"I know Mr. Spong and the people writing the editorials are highlyeducated, using big terms and words; but in my small words.You don't know my Jesus, but I wish you did. You see, I havehope and you would too if you really knew Him.A book such as this I will not rate, to me it is blasphemy."
1,What Planet is the Author From?,"Every now and then a book comes along and elicits the thought ""What planet is the author from?"". This is such a book. Mr. Spong, a retired protestant bishop who made a career out of throwing out any portions of the Bible that did not accord with the latest editorials of the New York Times, has now written a book in which he decrees that traditional Christianity, by which I assume he means Christianity based at least somewhat on the Bible, is dying out. What a hoot! It is liberal non-Chrisitianity, of which Spong the doubter is a terrific exemplar, which is on life support while orthodox Christian sects are thriving. Proof of this is provided by just a glance at how the mainline Protestant churches infected by this type of nonsense are dwindling to insignificance while the Evangelicals, Catholics and Orthodox are thriving. An interesting example of projection. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading unintentional humor."
2,Happy Retirement,"Spong's theology, like this book is only useful for those that want to embrace a spiritual life which does not demand dying to their own ego projections, a psychological condition that transpersonal psychologist Ken Wilber refers to as Boomeritis. ""Boomeritis"" would in fact be my suggestion for a concurrent reading.As an Episocoplaion preparing for seminary, I read Spong because I know that I will be confronted with those that embrace his work and I want to be prepared for such encounters. It is not an enjoyable position. Theism is not dead, it just needs to be redifined."
3,My first Amazon review ever,"This book probably should not be your introduction to jazz guitar; I would expect it to have more value to somebody who already knows some things and wants to be acquainted, as the title says, with styles. I did not buy the book for that reason; I bought it because I wanted to learn jazz guitar and my limited fretboard and theoretical knowledge kept me from understanding the WHY of WHAT I was playing. I can't recommend a good starting point but unless you have an advanced knowledge of the fretboard and/or jazz guitar, this is not it."
1,"Stay away from Panasonic Recordable media - Get Verbatim or Sony, instead.","Stay away from Panasonic Recordable media - Get Verbatim or Sony, instead.I record to Blu-Ray media very frequently (more than 400 recordings a year). I have experience with Panasonic, Sony & Verbatim recordable Blu-Ray media. Nearly every Panasonic BDRE disc I have - eventually failed.To add insult to injury, Panasonic WILL NOT replace them - not even within their VERY SHORT 3 month warranty period (Sony & Verbatim have lifetime warranties)I have tried (LITERALLY for many hours) to get Panasonic to replace their defective discs - but eventually gave up.I made it as far as the office of the president (in the USA), but they too were unwilling to replace my defective discs."
4,Excellent quality but a little expensive.,"The drive complies with the standard Blu-ray Disc in 50 GB, to be recorded only once, it pays to consult other pack promotions. Expensive"
4,"A Great Read, Especially When Working on Your German","My German 4 AP class used this book as our second semester reader. It was great. It had an interesting plot, unlike most other texts I've read in a foreign language, and it wasn't too hard, so that with a little help from our teacher, we were able to figure out what was going on. I would highly reccomend this to any upper level German class, or someone who is jut looking for a good German book."
1,Der Richter und sein Henker is great for the student of Germ,"The book has extensive footnotes, an extensive vocabulary and questions and exercises on every chapter. It is a well written detective novel by a world renown writer. The language is not too terribly difficult, depending on how precise you want to translate. Believe me, you will enjoy this book. It was made into a movie called, ""The End of the Game"", with Jon Voight, John Sutherland, Robert Shaw, Martin Ritt and Jacqueline Bisset."
2,Oops,"A word of warning. Totally don't get this if your girlfriend's or wife's name begins with a letter other than ""C."" And if you do accidentally get it, and she gets mad, don't shrug your shoulders and say, ""eh, close enough."" It's just not a good idea."
2,Too Bad,"Pretty much, I bought a $13 single. Mine and my husbands song is the bonus track and I didn't know what to expect from the rest of the CD. Wish I could say, I was pleasently surprised but, the rest of the music on the CD is boring. I'd go with a $.99 I-Tunes download instead."
1,Great Performances/Lousy Audio Mastering,I played this DVD on several systems and found I had to crank the bass while lowering the highs to get the thing to sound close to acceptable. It sounds like this recording was made using live microphones without using feeds from the mixing board. It's a shame because it's such great music.
5,Must Own DVD!,"Outstanding footage of the last Earth Wind & Fire World Tour that Maurice White did. (He did a tour of Japan in '95, but that was it.) Great show!But don't give up on this incredible band... I saw three outstanding shows in 1999 and have to admit that they are better than ever!!!"
5,The Fire's Here!!!,"Recorded live in Japan during the ""Heritage"" tour in 1990, EWF is at the top of its game with dazzling chereography, tight arrangements (especially the horn section)and a song-catalog that would make any band proud. Sonny Emory shines as a rapper and a drummer (and proves that concert ""drum solos"" can be entertaining without being endless or boring), while lead vocalists Maurice White and Philip Bailey sing with excitement as if they were performing these songs in concert for the first time. Other highlights of this excellent well-mixed concert dvd include solos from guitarist Sheldon Reynolds and saxophonists Andrew Woodfork and Gary Bias, and a magical finale that will leave you breathless. In fact, this whole dvd will have you up and dancing."
5,Entranced by this video,"I placed this DVD in my player and from the beginning felt as if I was magically transported to a time and place where the main thing that mattered was the tremendous display of talent by the greatest band of all time.I've watched it several times and continue to re-experience the wonderful feelings I had in attendint their concerts. Even my 15-year-old, hard-core rap and hip-hop fan of a son sat spellbound we watched this group do what they do best.It's a must buy for EWF fans and a reminder-- in these days of sampling and remakes-- of a time when extraordinary musicians took the stage and gave their all."
3,Not bad but not great,"This EWF performance was more of a Las Vegas production. It was OK, but I really wanted to see EWF with a little less show-biz. If you really want the EWF experience, I think you would be better of going back to some of their earlier performances."
5,Buy it!,"A must for all EWF fans. Fantastic picture and sound. Makes you want to cut a rug. Don't wait.....order now, you won't be sorry."
3,"Great Music, just a concert presentation!","The music in this offering is excellent. After seeing them in concert in the early 80's(?), this DVD was a let down. As this DVD begins, with three diamond shapes illustrating the EWF fly around the screen, then after the seeing the band appear out of smoke in front of three obelisks's, that was basically it for the special effects. I know the band is getting older, but the old time effects I remembered were gone. The music is great, stage presence is excellent-but a downer if you expect more."
1,suspension element,I got a totally generic product of low quality finish. Did not exactly fit the car and I had to use some of the old hardware even though was described as having everything included in the box. Packaging was NON. The 2 original boxes taped together with transparent tape and shipped. The ride is very bad on this shock but like I mentioned it is possibility to be a copy of the original.
3,Effective use of twins,"Two sisters, both opposites in terms of personality but almost identical twins, find themselves in Paris. One, promiscous, untalented, and ultimately pathetic, committs suicide. The other takes her identity to forge a singing career, discovering things about the dead girl she didn't really know (e.g.her participation in a porno film). Finally, having achieved success, she rejects it for a life with the her sister's boyfriend.This book holds the interest, using popular language and anglicisms that have entered French despite the efforts of France's Academies. Despentes, reportedly an ex sex worker, knows the milieu, the popular culture, about which she writes. The characters interest: none are very sympathetic,but all seem real."
3,Unsatisfying unless you read the first volume,"I didn't realize this book was the second in a series when I grabbed. Like most second books, most of the character development occurred in the first volume, so you don't become hugely attached to the characters.The characters move about without any real sense of motivation. There is no driving force behind the first half of the book, so despite being well-written, it is a very slow read.Cursing: None, although one character is referred to several times as a [...].Gore: None, although a character does get whipped harshly and there are several plague deaths and the bodies are described.Sex: Nothing overly descriptive, but sex scenes are described in the book."
4,A good item to have on hand,"What can I say. This tool is so useful for so many things. I guess any where you need to apply force and don't want to damage your goods is a good place to start. I use mine with my cornerbead crimper to set corner bead. (I also screw it off and tape it so it never cracks.)They work great for cabinet and sheving assembly. They are a must for installing ""ready frame "" type steel door jambs. The're great for adjusting counter tops. And on and on . I would say the list of usefulness is limited only by your imagination."
2,Not up to Snuff,"Craig is an excellent historian - but this work is not up to his usual standard. More of a casual history of the ""political"" end of Pussia. A slim volume, thankfully, which is its main recommendation."
4,Disappointing,"I've purchased Burda Plus before, but this was a disappointing issue. Not much in it worth sewing at all!!"
2,Long time for delivery,"I purchased this item in January, but I haven't seen it yet. It take a long time."
1,Undersize,"It was not what I expected. It was very tiny I mean small and I guess you have to buy a whole bunch in order to make them like a chain, cause I couldn't figure it out what it was about."
2,Obviously low budget,"This movie looked like a video game made into a movie with a very limited budget. If you can get past like 30 minutes, it gets better. The story isn't THAT bad (except for the beginning). The acting is mediocre at best. The CG and cinematography are kinda crappy...Just think low-budget, and that's this movie. If you're bored and got nothing else to do, rent it but don't expect much."
1,Terrible,I have no real idea if the story is good or not. I was unable to watch more than a few minutes because of the horrendous acting.Skip this one!
2,disappointed,not much to say..thought game and movie might be linked...not...no real special effects...but nice ue of irony and plot twist at the end....but i don't recommend it
1,Stop!!!! Don't purchase or Rent.,"Not even worth the $1.99 price for rental. In fact, I'm sure it couldn't have cost much more then that to make the film.Terrible, terrible low budget movie. I stopped it only 10 mins into it.The worst."
1,definitely sucks,i just found out you cant give a 0-star rating. this flick is so bad. i cant read the film festival laurels on the cover but they did convince me to give it a try. wow. that was a mistake
3,So so...,"This movie was at least interesting enough for me to want to see what happened in the end. I don't regret renting it. Nothing all that memorable, though."
3,not bad,"Once I got past the budget problems, I found myself pulled into the story. The plot wasn't as simplistic as I first thought. I've seen better, but I've definitely seen worse. It was much better than the cheap movies they play late at night on tv, which I thought this movie was going to mimic."
3,A good script,"Yes, I agree, the acting isn't stellar but the actors do manage to sustain a tense mood. This is a slow boil type of movie but (probably due to its low budget) there isn't a huge climax, just a quiet realization. Suspenseful. Engaging. Kept me guessing as to where things were headed right up to the end."
3,Solid Low Budget SciFi,"This movie does not make a good first impression. There were numerous times I was tempted to quit watching during the first third of the film. If you can make it past the rough spots--underwhelming special effects, iffy dialog and acting, especially early in the movie--there is an enjoyable science fiction experience to be had here. About an hour into the movie I realized that I had been pulled into the story. The low budget shows itself in the usual places: mediocre-at-best special effects, a bland location (for an alien planet), a script that needed a few more passes, scenes that could use a few more takes. Despite these limitations, I enjoyed the movie. I would love to see a sequel/remake with a larger budget."
3,Very entertaining,"The script has a few holes, but overall, it was a good plot and somewhat of a mind bender. The actors were not very strong actors, but they did pretty well. This was definitely a low-budget film, but they did very well with what they had."
2,Flawed story,"I'm not going to talk about the low budget aspect that others have mentioned, except for the fact that for under $25K they did a heroic job. No my problem is with the story, specifically that we're supposed to believe that such an unprofessional bunch would be sent to save humanity. The infighting at the beginning of the movie between the humans is unbelievable. Have the writers not ever met someone in the military? I don't mean your average first year boot, I mean professionals with experience who would probably be selected to undertake this task. There would be no fighting, there would simply be the mission, and the dedication and commitment to complete it by a group skilled enough to accomplish it."
4,Independent film with potential,"This feels more like an extended episode of the New Outer Limits which is why it appealed to me. The story is not bad after you get about 1/3 the way into the film. I really think it has more potential to be a remake with a bigger budget; however, a sequel with a bigger budget would be just as cool. Overall I recommend it for low-budget B-movie fans without hesitation."
5,Where was this book when I started raising my kids?,'Parenting Power in the Early Years' is a must have for all new parents. It is even helpful for those working in a daycare facility or ones that have a daycare in their home. Brenda Nixon's book is easy to read and enjoyable. She has a lot of great ideas targeted to concerns of a new parent. Being a parent herself she is able to draw from real life experiences. I would offer this book to anyone that I know.
4,MOST TRUSTED TEACHER,"I love Hanh's insightful writings and have read many of his books. Unfortunately I had an Oh no, not an aha experience - I still fear death and all the pain that accompanies it. It's just hard wired into my brain. Quite frankly I do not believe any words or understanding would eliminate it. I did get alot out of the teachings and they are useful for gaining an over all equanimity and understanding in daily life."
4,Good Book,"I bought this book because I saw it on an old episode of ""Six Feet Under"". It is a peacefull book and a very easy read. I can't say I learned much from it but it was uplifting none the less. I read A LOT of spirituality books. I have found that my friends who are less the spirtual have really benefited from this book. Bottom line, read it, enjoy it and pass it on."
2,AUDIO CD version,"Thic Naht Hahn is a brilliant teacher and communicator....the PROBLEM with the CD version is that -HE- doesn't read it, someone else does.....I found it impossible to listen to....get the book version"
5,Simply Amazing,"I've read many of Thich Nhat Hanh's work but this seemed to resonate so well with me. If you are exploring concepts of the Two Truths, Dependent Arising, and Emptiness this book has subtle meditations that will be beneficial for all. I'm find more and more that every line of his poetry is a subject for meditation. A must read."
5,I love this book !,"I recommend this book for anyone who has experienced the death of a close, loved one."
5,Simple clear writing style provides a view of death that teaches about impermanence and the interbeing of all things,"The book offers a way to regard life that addresses the fear most people have of death. He says that our true being is not segmented by birth or death. It exists across space and time, manifesting only when causes and conditions are right. Nhat Hanh uses metaphors and simple illustrations to reveal that our human life is just a temporary manifestation, much like a wave on the ocean.I really liked Thich Nhat Hanh's clear, pure and simple writing style, providing a view of death that teaches us about impermanence and the interbeing of all things. This is a great companion book to The Tibetan Book Of Living And Dying."
3,Deceptively simple,"A short but insightful read. As with most books that deal with concepts and ideals, this book can appear at first glance to be deceptively simple. Yet I think that if you take the time to digest the message then it can prove quite provocative.Not a book for the casual read, more something that you want to site down and read extensively while having the time to ponder more deeply what is between the lines. It is also a book that you will be able to return to any number of times, read again and still gain something from it.If you are interested in a 'Buddhist' angle to the question of death and suffering then this is a recommended read. If you are likewise interested in an alternative approach to the concept of the finality of death, then again the book is a worthwhile read but remember to take your time to digest what may at first glance appear as a simplistic approach to one of the inevitable results of life."
1,DONT follow this doll as a role model!,"dolls arn't supossed to be role models! dont treat this doll as a role model! if you did and you dressed like this...ugh..id puke aloud man!!!!!! me best friend followed thee terrible wit of doll...... and became aflicted and bad, and she was murdered!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!i shant rest unless i find a way to put doll badness at its end!a shame for Barbie!JANNA!!!!!!!"
1,lisa,"GO AHEAD LiSA!!!! JIon THE SisSy MY SCENE GANG! MY SCENE ARE STUPID AND THEY WEAR BAD ClOTHES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SO GO AHEAD LISA BE B.F.FS WITH THOSE mY SCEN OBSESSED WEIRDOS/FREAkS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You guys will be perfect for each other!!!!! You are all gay, stupid and like to wear retarted clothes!!!!!!!!!!!!-zoe!"
1,Is Mattel kidding?,"This looks like Working Girl Barbie. I cannot imagine that anyone would actually buy this doll for their child; it is completely inappropriate. I have bought my girls My Scene dolls in the past (though I sometimes end out throwing away the really skimpy clothes,) but this makes me want to boycott My Scene."
1,my god...,"First of all, I DON'T thnk I'm ""very popular"" and I know everyone hates me. The only people who like me are the people who freakin hate My Scene. and NO! I'm neva eva gonna go away. And you can't make me!!!!-zoe"
2,"Ghetto Bling, $2 Hooker Barbie? What the holy hell is next?","A ""my scene"" emo Ken with stringy black hair, at an angle, covering 3/4 of his face? Wearing a tight tweed sweater and acid-washed ripped jeans with doodles from his past boyfriends AND hot girls? How about the mini razor blade accessory, with cuts on his wrist going across the highway, of course."
1,Completely inappropriate,"I think they should rename the doll. Instead of 'My Bling Bling' Barbie, why not 'My Little Hooker'? It's disturbing to think a toy manufacturer would market these dolls to girls as young as 6 years old, but what disgusts me more are the parents who would buy them."
1,Bling???? Bling?????,Ok folks!!! What has Mattel done? Besides try to teach our children that it's ok to look like a hooker!! The only thing that this Barbie is missing is Ken so he can be her pimp! Shame on you guys! As of right now my child or I will not be strolling down the Barbie Isle. Come on Mattel STOP AND THINK WHAT HAS BROUGHT YOU THIS FAR THIS LONG!!!!!!!!!!!
3,This is what people call a role model?,"Okay, what are we teaching the little girls of today? I am 16 and I'm in search of an appropriate doll for my 6-year-old sister's birthday. She had said something about wanting a ""'pretty' bling-bling doll"". So Im searching for my scene bling bling dolls and a sluty row of dolls pop out and Im shocked. Okay I have to admit, these dolls are load of fun, and they last forever. Educational value? Zero.0.Zero.0. But I put one because I can't put zero. What was mattel thinking when they put this doll on the rack? We are showing little girls its okay to go out hardly covering what we need to cover. Thats not good. Girls look at dolls as their role models. The little girls of today are going to turn out like this. We better do something. Thats all I have to say."
1,It looks like mosquitos ate her eyelids to shreds and that is why she squints ! hehe,"I like Myscenes and all,but this is just discusting!"
1,This definitely is not Teacher Barbie! What does this Barbie do for a living?,"To those of you who think the Bling Bling Barbie does'nt look like a slut, if you saw a real live woman walking the streets of your town in this outfit, wouldn't you think she was dressed pretty slutty? Her shirt is just basically a scarf that barely covers her breasts. I wonder if when she bends over we will see a thong under her skirt! This doll is WAAAAAY to sexy for impressionable young girls to be playing with, but I guess I'm just a middle aged mom from the midwest, so what would I know!"
1,Ugly,"I honestly hate this doll. Not to be rude I don't like it. When I saw it in stores, it was more ugly. Not to be offensive but I don't like it. I would rather go with a different collection like My Scene Goes Hollywood."
1,and u thought bratz were bad!,"this doll is so unxeceptable. Barbie's skirt just barely covers her bottom, her boot and socks go up higher then her knees. Her top barely covers and she has her bellt botten showing! She might as well have a belly botton ring to match her clothes! This doll is definatly not a good influence, uless you want your kid to gro up like this! who ever would make this doll for kids is serisly messed up in the head. ilke the nothing about this doll! thanls alot mattel"
4,Very glam!!!!!!!,"SUCH a nice doll! It does have a 'mini skirt' but still, why shouldn't litle girls buy it? The bling thing about it is very cool. I think that girls should put on make-up, dress up and look at themselves and say ""WOW! I look really bling. That is soooooo cool!"" They should feel good about themselves. That is why this doll is so awesome. Overall I think that this doll is beautiful AND educational. One of my favourites!"
5,"OK I nkow she's dressed a lil bit ""skimpy"".BUT","She is SSSSSOOOOOOOOO totally outrageously beautiful.I bought her and the other dolls as well and I must tell you they have NEW eyes, They look so much more realistic Barbie has this thick long luxurious hair and the clothes well the outfit she's wearring I took it off BUT she wearring the extra dress and looks GREAT, I love these more than the other my scene dolls I must admit mattel did a woozie on these, the Madison is the most beautiful she has ever looked, I hope this look stays, Ok she is a bit sexy but some yooung gils dont notice and the once that do well.. tell them its alright to pretend the doll is her in a ""fantasy"" pretend world but we as people don't dress like this in the real world unless we want a bad rep.Hope this helps if your interested in buying her you can always change her clothes she can wear the "" Fashion Fever Barbie clothes""."
1,oh-em-f-gee,"I used to love only my scenes. That has changed with Mattel's inability to release any really good lines and these... prostitutes. I love the new faces, and I must admit the belly button piercings are cool, but the clothes, oh my god the clothes. Watch this item get recalled because of pissed off mothers claiming Mattel is trying to make their daughters sluts. That skirt ends and it doesn't even cover the whole of her butt! Her shirt looks like two pieces of cloth tied around her breasts in a poor attempt to cover them. The other dress(or that's what I hope it is) looks like one of those bathing suits 5-year-olds wear that consists of a one pice with a little skirt attached to it. This is horrible. Absolutely disgusting. They needed to be more daring, but not like this. And the rabid(now hypocrite) fans said the bratz were sluts."
1,Is her name Trayla Trash?,"I would much rather give my girl a box of sticks to play with than this ugly thing. Way to go, Mattel!"
1,2nd Review on This Ugly Doll,"Please, your reviews are going to be read by adults who want to buy gifts for their little girls, nieces, and granddaughters. Anyways, this doll is nuts! I already reviewed her, but I had to again when I realized how trashy that one girl was talking! No curse words, puh-lease!Parents, please DO NOT buy this awful doll."
1,Zero stars - but it's not an option,"Does this doll come with her own poll and a mix tape of techno songs to strip to? Does Ken now wear a feather in his hat and drive a tricked out Cadillac?Great role model indeed. I expect to see the girls whose moms bought them any of these dolls on Maury Povich - either the ""You Dress Trashy"" show or the venerable ""Who's My Baby's Daddy"" show.But who cares as long as she has nice hair, right?Enjoy."
1,porn star barbie,"Just about everything negative that can be said about this doll has been said here, but I still feel that I have to put my two cents in. My daughter will be nine next month and, as always, she wants a Barbie doll for her birthday. This is one doll that not only will my daughter NOT be getting, but one that she will never even see if I can help it. Little girls love things that are shiny and sparkly and glitzy, but this doll goes way beyond that. The doll looks like a [...]. The clothes and makeup just do not make sense in any other context. Yes, it's just a doll, and it's the parent's responsibility--not the toy company's--to teach kids what is okay and what isn't. But do you want your sweet little girl looking at this and imagining how pretty she will look one day in a crotch-length skirt?"
1,WOW is all I can say,"Isn't Barbie supposed to be pretty? She looks like an ugly prostitute, hands down. I wouldn't ""wear that to a club"" and neither would ANY of my friends. Her make up is gross, and especially the look on her face says, ""Do me now."" There's a difference between beauty and over-the-top trashy. You can't deny that she looks like a porn-star, which is an industry that is illegal for teenagers who get this doll to participate in, but I guess we're preparing our youth for this at a younger age now."
1,wwwaaayyy to revelin',he shirt is like waayyy to revelin'(sp)other than that she's ok.i like bratz better but i like my scene to.besides it is kinda stupid to be fightin' about a stinkin' doll i mean really are we 5 or something?
1,Gross sick nasty,"This doll is by far the ugliest, nastiest, sluttiest dolls alive. OMG she scares me.And her shirt, gross. It looks like something hanging from her boob, OMG that is nasty.I think, Bratz dolls are so much better.Oh, and just so you people know, this war won't end cause people don't have to like My Scene dolls, and we can say what we want, and I say this doll is nasty and ugly, and Bratz are totally better. Which is true.So, get a Bratz dolls, their prettier and more appropriate."
3,Hmmm.,"WTF is up with Barbie's shirt??!! That is nasty. Not even 16 year olds wear that! She's pretty, but her stripper shirt just ruined it completely."
2,Weirdo...,"This is one of the Best Barbies in the My Scene collection!(...)She looks like a polar princess in the spring, or SUMMER!UHHH... A POLAR PRINCESS? AND WHAT AM I? THE FREAKIN PURLE TOOTH FAIRY?Girls will love the sparkly theme, and will adore all the fab acessories.WHY WOULD THEY WHAT A BARBIE DOLL DRESSED JUST IN SPARKLES. SPARKLES LOOK SO GAY ON MY SCENE DOLLS.Her dress is very cute and modern.I DONT THINK ITS EVEN A DRESS. ITS MORE LIKE A BRA AND A MINI SKIRT THAT GOES WAY FARTHER UP THAN HER BOTTOM CHEEKSI know her other outfit shows a lot of skin, but I see girls dress like this all the time, plus it is just a doll, and she is fashionable while doing it!WHY, DO YOU DRESS LIKE THAT??? YOU SEE 6 YEAR OLDS DRESSING LIKE THAT?I recommend getting her, and you might just fall in love!YEAH, AND MAYBE EVEN MAKE-OUT WITH HER. I'M SUR ETHEY WILL, ALL OF THOSE MY SCENE OBSESSED FREAKS.BYE, WEIRDOS,-ZOE"
1,MY SCENE NEEDS HELP!,"If you are My Scene fan and you think I'm going to start making mean comments please keep reading because I'm not going to. I think this doll (more like this line of dolls) is gross, they a skanky and materiallistic (dunno how it's spelled). They are all wearing skimpy revealing outfits, and the name is the um, well, um, hows it spelled? This is a bad My Scene I suggest any other line of my Scene dolls."
1,Confessions of a My Scene Hoe,"Giiiirrrrllll! Let me tell you! I went to the amusement park last weekend and I saw girls there under 13 years old, wearing bikinis and temporary tattoos on their lower backs! They were just switching around like it was nobody's business and the parents were just standing right there, thinking it was just so cute. Then the other day I saw this tall, skinny girl wearing a skirt so short I was sure the slightest breeze would lift it up. Fortunately for her it didn't, so she must've had it super glued to her thighs. Whatever! Bling Bling??? That sounds like baby talk! I can't believe everyone jumped aboard the dumb rapper bandwagon and uses that babble! For real! Anyway, this doll is a major $LUT and she might as well be wearing fig leaves! The doll's name should be changed to My Scene Gold Digger Barbie. Skip this and get a Dora doll for your daughter. Hollllaaaaa!"
3,"you people make me sick, literally","Hi. I've read all of these reviews, especially the newest ones, and this is just stupid. You're complaining about a dumb doll, and you are adults! What kind of example are you setting for your chidren? I really don't like these dolls myself, and I'm 12. I wouldn't reccomend this doll to anyone under 11, and I'm sorry if I'm offending any of you. I really am. But for the parents of younger children, if you hate the way she's dressed so much, then think about this: Maybe it's because the dolls are made for OLDER girls. Did you ever think about that? My point is, if you hate these dolls so much, then don't BUY THEM.Stop fighting. It's just a doll. And again, I'm sorry if I offended anybody."
1,Bling Barbie,My daughter who is turning 6 saw this doll and expressed how much she would like to have it. I had to tell her that it was not something that I thought she should have and she asked why and I simply explained because of the way she is dressed. She is a very pretty doll and has lots of sparkles but the outfit is way too much. Since I don't want her to have this particular doll I did see an alternative that is still pretty and sparkles...it's the Bling Barbie but the head only that you can style the hair or put makeup on. I think I will buy that instead.
1,Good toy for me,"Ok so as a nation we have gone totally mad. This is a doll that is more suited for me, not my 6 year old. It is way too risque for young girls who are prone to idealize what the mainstream has to show them. Come on Mattel isn't my job as a parent difficult enough without my daughter seeing barbie in hoochie clothes."
1,Not appropriate for a child...,"My 6 year old daughter received this toy for her birthday today. This doll is VERY INAPPROPRIATE!! Why should a doll be teaching my daughter to dress in a way to show off this much of her body, when I am telling her to dress fashionable, yet modestly.I am VERY DISAPPOINTED in Mattel's new direction!!! The My Scene Dolls are not meant for little girls."
4,Nice doll,This doll unlike most My Scene has very little clothes and everyone knows that. This doll would be very pretty if you just put it in different clothes. Thats all you have to do! I think this doll is very pretty besides that. I give it 4 stars. K3L7M5
1,SAD!!!!!!,"THIS DOLL IS DISGUSTING! HOW IN THE WORLD CAN YOU MARKET A DOLL LIKE THIS TO LITTLE GIRLS? IS THAT WHAT WE THINK LIFE IS ALL ABOUT ""BLING-BLING""? AT LEAST BARBIE HAS DIFFERANT PROFESSIONS! DON'T SHOW OUR LITTLE GIRLS THAT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO DRESS LIKE THIS. PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS TOY!"
1,The Devil is a liar.......the kids are asleep when shes out.......,"who ever told sombody this doll was good in any way ecept to tell kids not to dress like this was lied to by the devil. As a 17 yr. old I know this type of dressing (I do it only at party's, but no one tells are kids this) I must say why would anyone try or want to give/have this doll. She looks like the poster child for love your daughter or she'll sell her body(or it's image) and do ecstacy.The age group this doll is targeted is looking for a role model and an identity. Even though sex sells you shouldn't buy it for your child.KIDS DON'T DO DRUGS!!!! UNLESS THE DOCTOR MAKES YOU.DON'T LET YOURSELF BE BRAINWASHED TO GROW UP LIKE THIS, BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN TO YOU. BOYS WILL ONLY WANT TO GET BETWEEN YOUR LEGS, DON'T LET THEM!!!!!!!"
3,I never thought...,"i never would have thought My Scene would do a doll like this.The clothes these barbie wears,looks like something a Bratz doll would wear! The shirt way too...I can't even explain.Maybe a little too sexy.The skirt way to short and high.She had to much makeup on.The Name ""Bling Bling"" makes it sound like it's all about the money that is wasted on buying great clothes.Buy this for a older girl.It would be better for 12 and up."
5,"Whoa,hold on a minute","What's up with all the parent attacks!?Since when did parents stop being cool.what happened?And can't you pick on something else,I mean a Barbie,how low can you sink.It's not about how Barbie has fallen,it's how you parents have fallen.It's just a Barbie.I think it's very pretty and really worth having.And have you heard,there are new My Scene Bling Bling dolls?Well they are the same,but now they come with a ring with a real diamond in it(with barbie)and other real jewels for with the other dolls,and they are all real and different."
1,:),"Glad to hear that you like me alot, Sara. Chelsea is really gay. She think that she is really smart and stuff when actually, she is stupid. shes VERY stupid.people who I freakin hate:*sara*chelsea*lara*lisapeople who rock the freakin world:*morgan*fairytail princess*me*zoeok. well, then, gald that lara, sara, lisa, and chelsea LOVES me. LOVE YOU TOO!!!!b*****s-zoe"
3,THE DOLL HAD POTENTIAL,"I REALLY LIKE THE MY SCENE DOLLS. MOST OF THEM ARE VERY NICE LOOKING AND HAVE CUTE CLOTHES, HAIR AND MAKE-UP. BUT THIS DOLL'S SKIRT IS JUST WAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!! TOO SHORT. AND THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT HER THAT IS JUST ""NOT QUITE RIGHT"". SO IF YOU'RE A MOTHER SHOPPING FOR YOUR LITTLE GIRL I SUGGEST SKIPPING THIS DOLL AND FINDING HER ANOTHER ONE. FROM ONE CONCERNED GROWN-UP TO ANOTHER."
5,"SAHM to 3 kids, SHUT-UP!!!","OH YEAH, LIKE YOU COULD EVEN BOYCOTT THESE DOLLS, THEY ROCK! SO SHUTUP! THEY'RE CLOTHES ARENT ALWAYS TRASHY! JUST DON'T LET YOUR DEPRIVED CHILDREN HAVE THESE DOLLS, AND GET OFF AMAZON! IT'S FASHION!!!"
1,Too bad you can't give 0 stars - what an inappropriate toy!,"This is not something for a little girl to play with. It's totally inappropriate! Look at how she is dressed? Do any mothers out there want their daughters dressing like that? Can you even call that a shirt that she's wearing? And she is supposed to be 16? A child of mine would never leave the house dressed like that and I would never buy such an offensive doll for one of my kids. Mattel, just because Bratz has taken some of your market DOES NOT mean you need to answer them in kind. Show some respect for the young ladies you market to and take this piece of trash off the shelves."
5,KIDS PLEASE!,"KIDS, WHERE ARE YOUR PARENTS? AND PLEASE GET OVER IT...WHE'RE TALKING DOLLS HERE..EITHER YOU LIKE BRATZ OR MYSCENE! NOTHING TO ARGUE ABOUT!!"
3,There are new and stupid my scene dolls are coming out soon.,"This doll is ok.But do you want to hear about the nasty and stupid new my scene dolls who is coming out???The collcetion is called ""Street Style"".They have a big belly button jewel,it hanging down,and a nasty tatoo.What is happening with the my scene dolls???They are becoming really nasty and bad this year.I am beging to hate them.By the way the bling bling dolls have a little belly button jewel,and I think it`s...okay,but these new nasty my scene street style are just stupid,and these things can teatch the little girl how to be nasty and stupid when she grows up.SARA SIBLINI!!!BRATZ LOVER!!!1/2 PART MY SCENE LOVER 1/2 PART MY SCENE HATER!!!"
1,What are we teaching are daughters,These new my scene bling bling dolls are ridiculous. the clothes are way to inappropriate for young girls. my seven year old will not be getting this for christmas. these dolls look like the grown women in the rap videos we hate to see. Half naked short short skirts. who gave mattel permission to even make these dolls.
5,Everybody`s opinion counts,Everybody`s opinions count.But does`nt everybody realize it could be different.Some people are hurtfull.Can people just be a little less judgeamentle and be nicer in there reviews?LGP3LNCEvery thing LUVERFOREVERIN ALL ETERNITYROCK SQUARED
3,I love the My Scenes but this type seems inapppropriate,"I love the MySCenes but, for some reason, these don't seem fit for a child. I think it could give them the wrong idea. But besides that I think the accessories are cute. I also love the Bling Bling car. It looks like it has glitter and rhinestones on it in the picture. Overall I think that this is more suited for a 14 year old (LOL) not for an 8 or 6 year old."
2,I like the charm but it isn't razzle dazzle,I wish that the Bunco charm had more on it. I wanted dice or something. This was the only one I could find. The charm itself is nice and is well constructed but doesn't sparkle.
5,Love It,"This was definitely as good as the first novel. It's fast paced, the characters are clear in your mind, and although it does contain detailed parts, it doesn't distract from what's going on. Love the show...Love the book."
5,just like tv,I THINK ROBERT TINE DID AN EXCELLENT JOB WITH THIS BOOK. I COULD IMAGINE EVERYTHING HAPPENING AS I WAS READING. I FOUND IT HARD TO PUT DOWN WHICH I FOUND HARD TO GET USED TO SINCE I AM NOT A READER OF BOOKS AT ALL. THIS IS THE FIRST BOOK THAT I ACTUALLY FINISHED AND IT HELD MY INTEREST ALL THE WAY THROUGH. I CANT WAIT FOR ANOTHER BOOK TO COME OUT AND I AM STILL LOOKING TO FIND BOOK ONE AS I KNOW IT WILL BE AS GOOD AS THE FIRST.
3,"Not Awesome, and a bit Sleazy","The story isn't very appealing, and parts of this are flat-out disgusting. I was a bit disappointed here. Deena remains a great character though."
4,Devilish and dastardly!,"The author leaves us with no room for suposition when it comes to scenarios - we've got the sea, ladies gossiping in Drawing Rooms, adultery, a duel and a highwayman! Good, clean fun with great characters that speak great English - I love a man in breeches who says things like 'Damn yer eyes man!' It echoes other writers and fictional characters of the Napoleonic period, a touch of Jane Austen here and a dash perhaps of Hornblower there and its fun. It does stray into parody but what the heck, I liked it!"
2,Well it works......... backward.,"Yeah, backward. If you step on it notes are not sustained. When you let go of the pedal notes ARE sustained. I got this for a Casio (which sometimes does this reverse trick on its own) but I also tried it with my M-Audio keyboard and it did exactly the same thing. Fail.Oh well, it didn't cost me enough to even bother returning it. You can buy this if you are really, really short on money and you don't mind a reversed sustain pedal. Or if you just want notes to be sustained all the time but don't want to hold down the sustain pedal."
4,Eye-opening,"This was a really refreshing book to read as it didn't bow down to Indian cultural stereotypes for a start and didnt opt for the fairytale ending. Instead it blew open the concept of being an Indian woman in Western society, but made sure never to victimise the main character Nila. I liked that since Indian literature has a tendency to glorify and exoticise, whereas this writer shows us a well rounded woman who can be weak but is only out to see who she really is. There are the other victimised characters in the novel, in the shape of Nila's mother who dies and her friend who commits suicide, yet the writer does not get overly sentimental, choosing instead to show what is behind their deaths. Though it was a bit stilted in places, perhaps due to the translation, it was an enjoyable read."
2,Now I know why the used CD only cost $0.99 :-),"I'm not impressed. The tone of the book is slightly pompous ... and the reader's style only makes this worse. The ideas were interesting, but nothing really revolutionary. I agree that with the authors ideas and his frustrations with Windows, and yes, speach recognition would be great."
4,Typical Bruckner,"First heard on a music programme on radio, sent for it immediately, very exciting and lively, massive swings of mood. Excellent recording."
1,Symphony No.9,"A legendary recording taken live in 1989. Some things cannot be planned, they just happen by accident or by the grace of some god. If you love Bruckner, or music, or have a heart and a soul, it is incumbent upon you to listen to it.The 1 star is the 6th missing one. (You didn't really think I would give it 1 star, did you?)"
5,Beautiful movie of Love and loss,Outstanding performance by Sean Patrick Flanery. Set in the mid 1940's this tale of love moves one to tears. Letting go of the one you love. Doing the tight thing. Self sacrifice and moral integrity are at the core of this movie.
3,Nice rolling laptop case,"This is actually the second time I've bought this product. I originally ordered it when i had a 17 inch Mac Book Pro. because I also have to travel with a laser projector and scanner, this case was simply too small and tight.I have sense gotten a 13 inch Retina display which is very thin, so I can now fit everything in. Things remain quite tight however, which is my reason for the less than perfect score. Handle can be difficult to extract but hopefully with time, it will become easier. I had wanted a TUMI office roller but the cost was so ridiculous, this was a great alternative."
1,"Warning, proceed only with gas masks This ""game"" stinks!!","I bought this game 2 days before its release.That by itself should have rung a bell, but I hadn't researched it. I simply bought it for its cover. Yeah, it has a great cover. Futuristic racing, a shooter, even multiplayer.One problem it doesn't work.I have a great pc system all my games work. I looked at the min. system requirements and I had all of them. Ok. So I install it,... Then I get to the game and it wants me to enter my name so I type it and nothing comes up. I press enter then type it, nada. I try everthing, nothing. So I get online and try the patch, ziltch. I e-mail dreamcatcher and they run me through the whole turn off everthing and then try it. So I try it, still, you guessed it, nothing.Maybe I got a defective game, but I returned it to the gaming store I got it from and I asked the salesman to look into it,...so, you decide."
3,the size is smaller than its spec,"This medal is delicately made, however the size of the real product is smaller than its description, the length of the medal is 10mm instead of 12mm."
4,"An eclectic effort, with uncertain results","Hank Garland's vibe player returns to Tennessee in a collaborative effort with some of Nashville's premier session players. Although his concept was laudatory, IMO only half of the rather short (37 min.) album hits his intended mark. His weakest tracks are the eponymous track ""Tennessee Firebird"", and ""Beauty Contest""-both are jam sessions between his jazz group, and the country folks as foils. On the other hand, Hank Williams' ""Alone and Forsaken"" and Ferlin Husky's ""Gone"" are the strongest tunes on here. They come out both complex and wistful.In reading the liner notes, Gary comes off as appreciative of the country musicians, yet seems somewhat contemptuous of their abilities. And that seems to show in his underuse of Buddy Emmons in an attempt to make an album that is neither fish nor fowl. The best tracks are brilliant, and with the mediocre ones together make this a decent album."
5,No better buy!,This product is great! I ordered them along with the series 4 and 5. All are pet shop quality. Will definitly order them again. Excellent quality and fast shipping
1,Seller scammed me!,"I was in the market for Bob the Builder books for my grandson since they were no longer available at local stores. This one seemed to be perfect for him. I was pleased to see it was a set of books in a pretty cool ""tool kit"" package. The product description said: ""Can we fix it? Yes, we can! With four sturdy tool-shaped board books -- a hammer, saw, screwdriver, and wrench, little helpers will have fun building along with Bob!""Imagine how surprised I was to get one book, not four, and no kit.The advertising is deceiving and I never expected that from Amazon or a vender with a relationship to them."
5,very worth it,"I couldn't find many bob the builder things around that weren't the same as what zachary had, so i went to amazon to find these books in a tool box, he absolutely loved them. i will probably buy them for my son if they are still available when he's a little older"
1,Not as nice as it looks,I received the Bob the Builder Box and it was all beat up. It is a carboard box and the corners were beat up and some of the paper covering the box was ripped off. I was very dissapointed.
3,"The books are okay, but the box should not be considered part of the toy.","These books are short and the wording is dull. The durability of the board books themselves apppears to be okay. My almost two year old loves the fact that the books are in the shape of tools and that his favorite ""Bob the Bob"" is seen in them!The box itself should NOT be seen as part of the toy. The front of one of the snaps came off during shipment and that would have certainly become a choking hazard had it happened while being played with. I decided to throw the ""tool box"" away and just hold onto the books.It does seem impossible to replace individual books from the set as the books are sold in a set ONLY. The exact wording on the back of the books are: This book is part of a package and is not sold seperately."
5,Bob Books,My 1 1/2 year old son loves Bob the Builder. He just loves these books. We take these books and put a few small Bob trucks in the toolbox whenever we go out to eat. He carries the box and the books and trucks keep him happy while we eat.
4,The shapes help create a story,"My 3-year old grandson loves these Bob the Builder books. He carries them around and pretends he is working with them saying, ""Yes, I can!"" The shapes and colors are great, I just wish there was more of a written story in the books -- they read too quickly. My grandson is learning how to make up stories of his own, however, and the hammer, wrench, screw driver and saw shapes help him with that."
5,"nice item, brings in fireplace effect with a lot less renovations","Plug this in, and you have a nice fireplace effect without having to run any chimney. It is compact (23"" W x 17.5"" H x 10"" D) and can fit almost anywhere you need a little extra heat. I have this in my front room on the first floor to boost the heat without having to turn up the main furnace and make the upstairs hot. It is 4500btu and can heat up to 400 square feet, and I got it for 80 bucks on sale.Sure, there are smaller, more powerful units for 10-15 bucks cheaper than this, but you do not get the decorative effect, nor the stability that this unit has. I have two small kittens that like to do their best ""Jackie Chan"" moves, bouncing off the walls and running sideways on furniture. They can't tip this over and break it. Worth looking into this unit if you want that extra pop for a room."
3,"It is ok, not what I expected","I thought it was going to be a cute poem, like up beat and rhyming. If you child has any disablities, it is not for them. It tells that God gave eyes for seeing, all the senses and arms and legs for doing stuff and goes on and on. God made everyone different and this bood doesnt' really reveal it. I probably would not recommend it to anyone"
1,Do NOT buy this book,"I am writing regarding your book which was given to my daughter by mymother for Christmas. I am sure that she saw how cute the cover wasand assumed that the content matched the title.Needless to say I was distressed to open the book to read it to mydaughter this evening and find in the inside cover two ISNB numbersone for the White version and one for Afro-American Version. Thisabsolutely shocked me. How could someone writing about how God madeeach child special have two versions of a book based on color?I hope that perhaps you realize that this is not in line with your""character builder for kids"" mantra and sadly far from being a goodChristian. It is a shame as it has other good messages and brightcolors my daughter would like. Instead, I will be throwing this bookaway."
1,Sappy and overly-saccharine,"The title is misleading; there is no demonstration of how a child ought to think itself special. The text is a poorly-rhymed and badly-scansioned listing of sense organs and positive emotions, and the things the child can perceive or feel with them. The items tend to run toward junk food (ice cream, pizza) and female relatives (mothers, aunts and grandmothers). The drawings are mock-primitive, meant to look as though a child drew them, but too regular to be authentic.A Jewish, Christian or Muslim parent who gives this book to a child thinking it will reinforce the family's religion will be making an error: the God portrayed in the text is not the God of Abraham, and the child-reader created by the book's God suffers no original sin. This is a New-Age religion.The only reason we still have it is that a friend of my wife gave it to our child as a birth-gift"
5,Happy with it,The lock mechanism is okay. It operates very nice and doesent seem to have any flaws in it. It stays locked when I lock it. Of coures any thieve with time and a little effort could open this baby easy. It is better then a shoe box but it isn;t a safe. The box does have key hooks below the money drawer and comes with about 10 plastic key rings to hook on the box hooks.The box is too small to use all the keys comfortably. I would want a box aleast twice the size if I were storing keys in it
4,The Edukators,"The Edukators isn't just a film about some kids who get into trouble. It is a film that asks people to think about their values, what they value, and how all of that can be subject to change based on your own perspective. With out being too heavy handed this film offers a lot of entertaining moments that leaves you with the ability to relate to the characters or at least empathize with them.It's a well paced film with a great plot. Good acting and a great cast.A must see."
4,"Excellent movie, very thought-provoking!","I loved this movie. The movie started off a bit slow and chaotic, but then eventually develops into a one of the most thought-provoking story. Its definitely worth the two hours. You can read my full reaction to the movie here:[...]Philip"
1,Boring and predictable,"I was utterly disappointed. The plot was very predictable, the dialogues terrible and every scene seemed to be so predictable. The idea was great but the movie isn't. Also, I found it way too long, which is part of the reason why I found it so boring. Very low pace.Yawn!"
4,"German Thriller, Good Acting","Daniel Bruhl gives a solid performance in this German film about 3 young political activists who oppose big business and government greed and corruption. Their covert break-in's of the homes of the uber-wealthy suddenly changes, during a moment of impulsive passion, from malicious hijinks to a much more serious dilemma. No spoilers here, sorry.Each of the 4 leading characters contributes to the intrigue and the dramatic development of a break-in gone wrong. Based on this film, I'd like to see more of German director Hans Weingartner's work. Excellent soundtrack too. Well worth adding to your collection."
2,Technicolor Angst,"Well, three German punks kidnap a rich guy (it doesn't really matter why). Most of the dialogue consists of a leftist rhetoric that hasn't been heard since the 1960s. There are lots of gloomy shots of the various characters brooding with vague looks on their faces. Two of the kidnappers are male, one is female. Of course there's a love triangle. They drink quite a bit and smoke some pot. Eventually they decide to let the guy go since they aren't the killing types. There's a silly little twist at the end that is good for a laugh.Find something else to do with your two hours, unless you want to practice listening to German."
1,Something Went Very Wrong! Quantaray Telephoto Lens 600mm-1000mm,"I was delighted to receive the item quickly, only to find out it did not fit my camera or any other known camera. I took it to two camera shops. The professionals there said they had never seen such a lens, and they thought it was a telescopic lens, not a telephoto lens. The Amazon source never said it required an adapter, and I cannot find anyone who sells the adapter, so I am out over $700! Ask me if I'm happy. If anyone knows where I can get the adapter, please let me know at AfiAdero@aol.com."
2,"I didn't need these extra nozzles,","I didn't know enough about the system to realize I don't need these nozzles. I may when the others get old and clogged up. I might have wanted some extra hose and full brass pieces which is essentially another whole system. I did not need any kind of pump. I did need more of the heavy plastic hose. Guess what? Don't spend the $$$ on the extra plastic hose they sell. I went to Lowe's and got a white heavy duty plastic high pressure hose that is used for dishwashers. They cut it for you at any length, it only cost a couple of dollars. It is the same circumference and works great as my extension."
3,Great product,"Great product, but I thought the shipping was too high. The plastic nozzles that came with my arizona mister where crap! They cracked! All of them. Shipping should not be so high, I bought 20 and at 5 per package and charged separately for shipping for each one not very happy about that. There was no competition for the nozzles so no chance at finding them at a better ship rate."
2,Frustration,I bought these for misting outdoors. Installed in a system which contained a good pump and double filter for sediments. It worked great for two days then a couple started producing a drip within 3 weaks all 24 was producing nice drips but no mist. Utterly disappointed. Wondering if i need carbons filters since i am assuming calcium deposition or other mineral ion deposition on the tips is producing the problem. Also considering corrosion as another problem since the brass is corroding and changing colour. If anyone has a suggestion for helping me i will be much grateful.
2,"Good product, but shipping is deceptive.","While the misting nozzles were as described, don't be fooled by the ""combined shipping"" tag. The only thing they combine is everything into one package. You still pay postage for each order of misting nozzles separately. I paid $19.95 for 5 packages of misting nozzles, and I paid $24.95 for shipping. They claim that Amazon won't let them combine shipping costs and said the misting nozzles were still cheap even if I figured in all the shipping costs. Typically, when a consumer sees a notice about combined shipping, you assume (I know..my fault) that it means they will combine everything into one package and only charge you shipping for that package. I felt very misled."
2,Clogging,Nice spray but need to make sure you install screens or filters spend more time cleaning them than using them.
1,The worst customer service ever,"I recently was going to purchase an orbit10106 5 pack.I noticed I needed more than 5 and was going to order two 5 packs.I noticed the shipping charge was $4.99 for one 5 pack. When I tried to order 2 the shipping chargewas $9.98 even though the weight of the total wouldnt have changed the shipping costs. So I sent them an e-mail andthey never mentioned anything about the shipping . All they sent back was a Rude e-mail that basically if you dontlike it find it cheaper somewhere else.If you cant trust them to send back a cordial e-mail how can you trust them if the product is defective !!!Granted the cost of the product was fairly cheap but, if you add the shipping costs you can find it cheaper elsewhere."
5,Great tool for learning musical concepts,"This really is a great tool. It's a great way for students to focus on concepts through interactive lessons and games. I'm using it as additional training for my students. They all really seem to like it. The theme is geared toward younger students though beginners at any age would benefit from using this. Caution - This software does not run on the 64-bit version Windows Vista. It runs fine on XP. I haven't tried it on 32-bit Vista yet, but I'm assuming the Vista seal only applies to the 32-bit edition."
4,Such a Deal,The CD was in great condition except for a little yellow paint on the edge. the paint did not seem to affect the music quality. The price was terrific.
3,"Karajan in decline, mismatched with Kissin","Karajan made an early recording of the Tchaikovsky First with Richter and the Vienna Symphony, and now, near the end of his career, he accompanies another supelative Russian virtuoso. But the results ae a strange mismatch. Karajan seems tired and fussy with the orchestral parts while Kissin is obviously raring to break free. To accomodate each other, they hit a middle way that isn't veyr satisfactory, and the absence of a mutual spark makes this a disappointing outing for both great musicians."
4,not worth it,"Good idea, bad execution. The projector is all but impossible to see. Even in a completely darkened room the image was hard to pick up. Following along with the book is even harder."
2,frustrating and disappointing,"Great idea, but the images are so tiny when projected and blurry. The book itself is not worth the money so if the projector isn't so great--its not worth it. The Princess Music Player is much better, the girls are playing with it daily while the projector sits unused."
2,"Good book, bad projector","The storybook is good, contains five standard princess stories - Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast, The Little Mermaid, Sleeping Beauty and Snow White.I've seen many comments about the quality of the projector. What should also be mentioned is that the light bulb within the projector is non-standard, so we have not been able to replace it."
4,Love it!,Great product! My four year old daughter reads and projects the story on her wall every night before bed. Great way for her to wind down after a long day! Small but clear picture....
1,Lame. Preys on grandparents who don't know any better.,"I agree with others who said that this only works as a book. The projector would only work in a VERY dark room and then (in the dark) the book, which also has some nice pictures, is barely readable.And the packaging is SO deceptive: The picture on the back shows a child using this product to her delight, and the projected image is so bright--gosh, it almost looks like a printed, manufactured image--Well, whaddya know, it IS!In our house, we can't even use it as a book now because we opened it and tried it out as a projector and now that's all our little girl wants--frustration, etc. We'll pull it out in a couple months with all signs of projector and disks removed, and it'll be a fine book.Shame, Disney, shame."
4,ok,"I love old movies. This was enjoyable. There is really not much of a story to it, just a lighthearted romance with a feel good ending. The acting was good, the story line a little different. I would recommend it if you don't want something too involved and just want a little entertainment."
3,one touch of venus,"Looks like some had a copy of this at home and video taped it,some of the heads are chopped off."
5,CLASSIC GOLD,THIS IS ONE OF THE REPUBLIC'S MANY CLASSIC PIECES THAT WAS FINALLY RELEASED ON DVD. IT'S A GREAT FANTASY WITH A SUPERB CAST. CHECK IT OUT!
5,One Touch Of Venus,This was one of my old time favorites. The casting and acting were just right. Ava Gardner was at her magnificent best. All she had to do was stand there. I particularly liked Eve Arden. This was just before Miss Brooks. When I watch this film I sit with a smile on my face and remember the first time I saw it.
4,Good advice for beginning speakers...,"As part of my Lotusphere preparation, I read the book 101 Secrets Of Highly Effective Speakers by Caryl Rae Krannich. As the title indicates, it's a series of short ""secrets"" (tips) on how to make effective presentations. The tips are broken up into categories such as Plan To Exceed Expectation, Build Your Body - Your Speech Body, Close With Power, and Prepare Like A Pro.This isn't a ""program"" to help you overcome your fear. Instead, it's more like a buffett of ideas. Most of the ideas are common sense, and will strike you as ""I know that already"". If you've given presentations before, or if you're an experienced presenter, you might not take much away from the book. But if you're just starting out on the speaking trail, the information in the book will help you to focus your efforts."
4,Great History lesson,"I showed this to my kids, who had never heard of it. I wish it were more accurate, I would have given 5 stars it it were.This is an important part of our recent history that we should not let be repeated. But I recommend you look upand research Ruby Ridge so that when you show this to your family you can explain what parts are accurate."
1,A total hatchet job on an innocent man attacked by the Feds!,"Leave it to Hollyweird and the Zionist-NAZIs to distort all that happens outthere to 'We the People'! This madefor TV garbage is as bad as the 'Man-hunt in the Dakotas', which smears aman murdered for his beliefs,e.g., theGordon Kahl story. A better video tosee would 'Tragety at Ruby Creek,which is the correct name of the townin which Randy Weaver and his latebride had their cabin in, starringLt. Col. James 'Bo' Gritz, until nowunavavilable on amazon.com."
5,Two great artists playing wonderful music by Mendelssohn,"I fell in love with Mendelssohn's Concerto for Violin, Piano and String Orchestra ca. 20 years ago when they were playing it on the radio. My husband tried immediately to buy it for me but he couldn't get it anywhere. Recently I discovered that there existed this wonderful recording with Martha Argerich and Gidon Kremer, and I started looking for it via internet all over Germany. But I couldn't find it. I really must tell you that this excellent recording is no longer available in my country. At this point I remembered Amazon.com. and I'm so grateful that I finally found at your store this CD which includes also the very nice Violin Concerto in D minor. Thank you so much for sending me this wonderful music! Ursula Krauß."
4,Drunken tunes,"I would sy this is one of best celtic punk albums to buy along with any other swingin utters release, the tossers play a good hybrid of genres which works well in pretty much every song its a merry album thats goes well with a barrel of guiness."
3,a little off the mark,"i have loved the tossers and seen them for a long time. However, i was kinda disappointed when this new album came out. Dont get me wrong its not a horrible album, because its stil good celtic inspired music. This cd is to slick for me and a little over produced, and its missing alot of energy of the last cds and eps. I think the tossers need to go back to basics and replan the next album release."
3,"Great Movie, But Not Exactly What It's Cracked Up To Be","The movie was very good...I will warn though - a lot of footage can be seen in ""NHL All Access"" and other than that the ""behind the scenes"" footage not also on ""All Access"" was not all that I thought it would be."
3,Choppy coverage of a great season,"This video seems to focus a bit too much on sentimentality and Ray Bourque, where it could have used increased coverage of the regular season or even just more detailed coverage of each finals game, great goals (like all of Chris Drury's during the playoffs), great saves (Bourque doing a mid-air stop of the puck), and even obstacles (Sakic injury during the first part of the LA series)."
1,Sorry I bought,I received this pen in a timely manner. It was dried out and would not make a mark on any surface. What a shame. Look elsewhere for a different type.
5,"A damn funny movie. Girls, music, laughs, everything!",It was such a funny movie and I laughed the whole time. There wasn't a part where I said that was stupid. I just watched it 5 minutes ago and I'm still laughing.
2,The most ridiculously stupid movie,"A movie with a so called ""righteous black man"" and some students he takes to Florida the possibility of making in entertainment only in the end to buy into the sterotype of black entertainers."
4,"More than science, more than biography","This is not a page-turner; in spurts, you'll have to study. The book includes brief biographies of 30 physicists from Galileo to Hawking, along with descriptions of each subject's science, often with diagrams and a bit of math. I liked the book's continuity: scientific descriptions often link to what went before and what is to come.Recommended for anyone who wants historical perspective in physics and who doesn't mind some diagrams and some gentle math. If you read this book, you will have to think, but you don't have to be a scientist to cope with it."
2,Dull,The book contains too little about each scientists life to be interesting and goes into excessive detail on the scientific side.It is a dull read
2,get the book instead,"this tape doesn't really give you anything if you've read any of covey's other material, especially 7 habits book"
5,Thought-provoking ordering of old & new ideas on leadership,"I have recently purchased the book ""Principle-Centred Leadership"", and I would like to share the feeling of inspiration I have gained during my first reading of the book. For some time I have been grappling within myself about many of the issues addressed, and now some of the ideas I have had are gathered together and presented in a manner that is both thought provoking as well as enlightening. My search for knowledge was initially aimed at improving my contribution within my work sphere, but increasingly I found application in my private life, ie my relationship to my wife and to my young children.While it appears to me that the book is aimed at the individual, it forms a strong basis for the individual to change the environment within which he finds himself, once again both at work and at home"
2,Principle Centered Leadership,"am a devotee of Stephen Covey and was moved when I listened to his Principle Centered Leadership on tape various years ago. I felt that his principles, as articulated in this tape version, matched my beliefs of principle centered values. Principle Centered Leadership is now available on CDs and I have purchased this new version and given it to subordinates and peers as a way of establishing a common value centered understanding of each other. I had not listened to the CD version until recently. I must say that I was very disappointed with this version. It is edited significantly from the tape verion to the point that I had difficulty understanding and following the principles this conceptual model spouses. The people I had given the CDs to had diffulty understanding the concepts and felt that it was arduous to listen to the CDs. I am sorry because I believe that the principles are sound but cannot longer support the CD version."
1,"Duplicates ""The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People""","I had read Covey's most famous book, ""The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People"" a couple of years ago, and found it to be a very useful and impressive work. ""Principle-centred Leadership"" is a very poor-quality, disorganized rehash of the same material. One might get something out of it if one hadn't already read ""The Seven Habits"", but in that case I would recommend going straight to the original work. A thoroughly disappointing experience, which has lessened my respect for Covey somewhat."
4,Complete to be a Leader,The book contains the following featuresExhaustive DetailsCurrent Situation (and Future)Priciple OrientedMust to be a Leader in today's radical businessEnvironmen
1,How to earn money with seven habits...,"The seven habits is a great book, the others repeat the same thing, in more pages. Autobiography from Covey could have this title : ""how make money with seven habits """
2,"Quality author, disappointing content","Covey's follow up to his best seller does not quite merit the high regard his first work attained. Many of the topics are merely restated common themes found among even average business degrees giving the impression Covey may have been seeking to benefit off his first significant success rather than provide any fresh ideas.I have always held to the belief that a single concept derived from a book, even if only discovered amid a single sentence, justifies the value of the book if the concept is new and profound. I did not find such a new concept among the entire book, and thus unless new to business leadership and management theory, I would not recommend this book."
4,Not as good as the 7 Habits,"Nothing much new here but if you haven't read the 7 Habits, this book is worth reading."
4,Excellent Book!,Covey's books always leave a positive impression on his readers because they inspire in a practical way that can result in immediate changes. Since everyone is a leader in some regard the audience for this excellent book is widespread. Principles do not discriminate. They work in all circumstances and cultures. Covey helps his readers discover ageless principles and makes their application a logical followup. The analogy of courageous explorers is given for people going into uncharted territories. That's everyone. Each of us face things unique to our lives. Covey encourages people to view these factors positively. Flexibility is essential to living the abundant life he explains. This book is full of insight that helps keep a person focused on living in a maximum way.
1,A disappointment,"I have read 7 Habits of Higly Effective People and like it very much as it was well written and full of a lot of insightful and mind opening ideas.I thought I would find something similar in this book but to my disappointmnet this book is very different from from ""7 Habits"". I find the book diffcult to read and and not inspiring at all."
4,Perfect for serious business professionals,"If you are serious about succeeding in the hectic business world, regardless of industry, then this book is a must-have for your personal library.The principles in this book (along with other works by Dr.Covey) has had such a profound influence on my own career as a motivational speaker and author.Besides influencing me in a professional capacity, Stephen Covey also assisted with my own transition to self-acceptance and a positive outlook on a better tomorrow. Go for it!"
2,A dud compared w/ the 7 Habits,"If you are proficient in The Seven Habits and you have a management or leadership career, this book could be a valuable tool. I would recommend reading The 7 Habits first, as a sound foundation to help you understand this book. Families and especially individuals will find little to gain from this career-oriented book. It isn't as easy to apply, confirm, or understand as the 7 habits. It contains some fresh material but much of it is a repeat from the 7 Habits. Much of Principle-Centered is repetitive within itself. This book is very pale and disappointing in comparison with The Seven Habits. In it, Covey attempts to negate Freud's theories by saying they were developed his theories from the study of neurotic and psychotic people. I wonder if it would follow then that Covey's books would not help such people. This book is more sermon-like and preachy than his other books."
5,You Need to Understand These Fundamentals,"Think about this idea.... In order to have trust, you need trustworthy people, in order to have empowerment you need to have trust, in order to have organizational alignment you need to have empowerment. What a concept !!! And yet so many of us try to create organizational strategies and ask people to align to them. If you want to take the truely effective route to getting your organiztion aligned to a strategy, read this book, better yet get the 6 set cassette tapes and listen to the over and over. You will soon begin to understand Covey's inside out approach and how it makes the world of difference in how you approach the problem of leadership in your organization. A must for anyone in a leadership position or wanting to influence someone in a leadership position."
2,Covey CD lacks tracks so is hard to use,"I'm a Covey fan and think his original ""Seven Habits"" is a fine book. ""Principle-Centered Leadership"" is OK, but adds little to the original. My wife has been listening to the CD version in the car and is justifiably irate that there are no chapter tracks on the CD. For example, if you want to review Ch. 5, or skip to Ch. 7, you can't -- you have to start the whole thing over. Unless you can plan on 72 minutes of continuous listening, you may have trouble ever getting through the CD."
3,"Wonderful theories, lacking in examples","I found the original Seven Habits book to be a real eye-opener for me, personally. This book has the capability of being an eye-opener from the business sense, and does indeed have some wonderful ideas on how to approach management, but it is very much lacking in concrete examples of what some of the concepts mean, and what implementing them might entail. The only section of the book that had any real examples in it was the chapter where Covey discusses balancing personal life with business, where he used examples from his own family (many of which were also used in the original Seven Habits book).Had this book had more examples, I think it could have been as big an eye-opener for me. I do still find parts of it useful, but it didn't have the power with me that it might have."
2,Too loud for car laptop use,"We tried to use this Wagan Tech Smart AC 120 USB unit to power an IBM Thinkpad T41 laptop in the car. The T41 AC adapter says it has an input rating of 100-240V 1.5-0.9A and an output rating of 16V 4.5A, so about 72 watts of output to the laptop. Of course, I don't know how efficient it is, so I tried plugging the adapter into a Kill-A-Watt power meter. The laptop (with a partially charged battery) uses about 21-25 watts of power while watching a disk-based video file (not a DVD). Our experience in the car with the T41 AC adapter plugged in to the Smart AC 120: the unit gets very warm while in use AND after about 10 minutes of use, the fan kicked in with an unbearably loud buzzing sound. Even freeway road noise at 60-70 MPH could not drown it out. So Mr. Dave's review from 3/12/2008 is right on the money. The unit might be overrated for extended laptop usage, especially older power-hungry laptops. But for a portable DVD player, it might be fine."
1,Cheaply made,"Product failed the first day. Cheaply made. Uses a fan for a heat sink which makes a lot of noise. Not great for the car when listening to music. Did not filter out electric line noise. Still had some noise over my iPhone. Don't buy! Plus side, adapter cord is long and the USB port for charging a mobile device is nice."
1,Poor product,This product is falsely advertised as a unit you can plug into the armrest on an airplane. I recently flew on American Airlines and found no such plug available for this device! Do not waste your money on this product!
4,Golden Bear,Living in bear country the wife loved it and wears it all the time. A tad smaller than expected but well received.
3,Baby Boomer?,"I was torn as to how to rate this video. The workout is great! The presentaton, the music, the instructors,and the actual exercises are all wonderful. It's low impact(one foot always on the ground). The Baby Boomer in the title made me think the pace might be a bit slower to accomodate my iffy back and wonkey knees. No so! The pace is FAST,FAST,FAST. If you are looking for a speedy, energizing workout, this is it! If your body can't handle quick transitions and movement,especially in a carpeted area, this may not be the one for you."
4,Totally cute and a bargain!,"I saw a similar pair of pumps for a lot more money in a high-end department store. I think these are cuter and more comfortable as well, not to mention about half the price. A great buy!"
3,"Interesting, but...","The book provides an interesting and candid picture--albeit not particularly pleasant, at times--of Asimov. It's a quick read, since it's really a collection of vignettes, and is perhaps the better for it. I read the Kindle version: no complaints."
4,More Interesting Than His Works of Fiction,"The first biography that I ever read. It was written in the final year of Isaac Asimov's life. I found the book to be entertaining on many fronts. First of all, Asimov was a devout atheist all the way until the end, although he was technically Jewish. Secondly, it was interesting to find out that a man that wrote over 50 science fiction books and over 400 books in all, almost never left the city of New York...ever! Finally, what I liked most about the book was how flawed an individual Asimov appeared to be, especially in the characterization of his children. He obviously loved his daughter and despised his son, David, although he refused to say that in so many words. This book was clearly better than any science fiction novel that Asimov ever wrote.Isaac AsimovWrote About Space and Time ButHe Never Left Home"
3,A Pleasant Read,"Obviously, the people that have an interest in this book are fans of Dr. Asimov, and they won't be disappointed (as evidenced by the near-idolatrous comments below). The book is written in the typical Asimov style -- clear, simple, clever, amusing. Bright high school students might find a kindred soul, and budding scientists might be inspired. It makes a good ""subway book,"" because it can be read piecemeal. Be forewarned that if you're looking for deep soul-searching or profundity, you'll have to find it elsewhere."
2,This book is an embarassment to a great sf writer,"As Martin Amis once pointed out, every anecdote Asimov tells involves him tossing off a witticism and ends with ""Everyone laughed."" Well, reading this book you might enjoy laughing at Asimov as he tries to pass platitudes off as deep thinking and flaunts that famous ego nonstop. You'll be laughing and laughing until you reach the part where Asimov is joking about what his last words will be and says (after the joke) that really his last words will be an affirmation of love for his wife; his wife here adds an editor's note that, those were, indeed, his last words. And then you go ""Awwww"" and feel bad for laughing at this poor guy. After all, he did write ""Nightfall"" and _Foundation_. But this book, this book is awful.If you want to read a good sf memoir, read Pohl's masterful _The Way the Future Was_ and see how it ought to be done; if you want to read a worse one you're goingto be hard pressed (but Anthony's _Bio of an Ogre_ might do the trick)."
2,free association kind of memoir,"I was a bit disappointed with this book. In Asimov's science fiction novels, his plot hangs together well, and the various details tie into the bigger picture. This is not at all true of his autobiography. Told in tiny chapters according to whatever bit of his history Asimov decided to write about at that moment, characters appear and disappear, and events are recorded with no explanation of their greater significance. Some chapters were wonderful, and I was laughing out loud. Others left me wondering why they had been written.Some parts of this book are definitely worth reading. As a whole, though, I'm not sure it's worth the reader's time."
2,Did not finish reading it,"I am always trying to finish books. I hate giving up in the middle.But I could not finish reading this one. A lot of the stuff he writes sounds like ""How great he is"" and so on... Of course he was a great personality. But this could be one reason more to be a little more decent in writing about oneself.Quite interesting for me was that he had the initial plot for ""I Robot"". Perhaps this would be a good book to read."
4,I. Asimov,"The indefatigable Dr. Asimov does a fine job in this memoir, which is at times irreverent, sincere, amusing and hilarious.Being prolific, his encyclopedic style is in evidence here, since the good doctor tackles and expounds upon almost every subject under the sun. From his very early youth to his mature years, everything important in his private and public life is here. For those fans wishing to learn more intimate details about the man, this book should prove a treasure trove."
5,This is a wonderful book...,"...but the Kindle version is just riddled with spelling errors. They are all over the place. It looks as though the text was scanned in, and errors were introduced and never corrected. ""Hitler"" becomes ""Hider"", ""I'll"" becomes ""PU"", ""and"" becomes ""arid"". Many many times throughout the whole book.This should be pulled from the store and fixed.The book itself is great; as an Asimov fan, I can recommend this to anyone who wants to know more about the Good Doctor."
1,Questionable language,"Regarding Rodney King's robbing a Korean store with a tire iron, the author says, ""perhaps it was the need for money, perhaps it was the stress, perhaps it was the feeling of helplessness and hopelessness over his lack of options"". After King gets away in his car, the Korean owner is able to get the license number so King can get arrested. The author says King was just ""luckless as usual"".I like the way she distances King's motives from his own self by using the article ""the"" instead of ""his"" to describe greed, stress, and helplessness/hopeless. Subtle, but telling. And damn that Korean store owner for giving Rodney bad luck yet again! I mean, hey, doesn't he appreciate that King just hit him with a tire iron and didn't shoot his ass? He ought to have been more grateful and given Rodney a pass I guess?Maybe it's just me, but this king of language is offensive. WHO IS THE VICTIM IN THIS ROBBERY?!"
4,An Enjoyable Book,"Animal books in general are great. This one is pretty good, too. At first, its a little confusing to get a hold on how everything works. I wasn't sure if it was anthropormorphic animals that were more human than animal, or whether they were just your typical talking animals. However, after everything fell into place, the book was good. Bobcat, Fisher, and Skink are pretty clueless, and so this is a new twist on the plot, which, when simplified to the maximum, is the same old, same old. Instead of a valiant bunch set out, knowing pretty much exactly what they are doing, they are confused and unsure of what will happen. The confrontation with the Blood Jaguar is very surprising. I liked it, you probably will, too."
5,An oasis in the desert of worthless books,It's just very refreshing to find a good book like this. I haven't had much luck recently in locating books good enough to warrant actually finishing them.
4,Dear Cara: Purchased at Amazon.com,"Dear Cara: Letters From Otto Frank is the story of an almost 20 year correspondence of Cara Weiss Wilson and Otto Frank, the father of Anne Frank. A very interesting book, but, some how I feel like I missed something in reading it. I did, however relate very much to the author, since her time line of growing up was about the Kennedy assasination, the Beatles, Vietnam, since that is what I grew up with too. It was also very moving when the author finally got to meet Otto and his wife, and got to see some of the immense correspondence that Otto kept up with some of the people writing in response to The Diary of Anne Frank. I don't know exactly what I expected from the book, but some how I couldn't get lots of feeling from it."
5,"fiction, non-fiction or non-fiction with embellishments","I read Who Walk Alone in 1948 and loved it. But now, according to some Google entries, the book isfiction, Ned Langford was never a real person, andthe author made up the character. Is there any truth to this. Can anyone give me the straight scoop?"
3,The Naxos Transfer is MUCH better,"I strongly disagree with Mr. Steinberg regarding the quality of the transfer; in my view the Naxos is far superior. Naxos made its transfer from the American Columbia disks praised by Mr. Hansen and the differences are great; the Naxos is much cleaner. Only on Naxos am I able to enjoy the wonderful subtlety of Weingartner's interpretation of the 9th without the distractions of dirty noise and inconsistent volume found on this CD. The Opus Kura and the Music & Art transfers of Furtwangler's 1942-45 Beethoven recordings are far, far better than this one."
5,What is not to like about this movie,"This movie was fun. Black and Blue get ahold of a bunch of cell phones and start their own business of hotwiring the phones to work on their service. This movie had that Friday feel. No big production, just a neighborhood that you will swear is only a few blocks from where you live. I almost didn't watch this movie, because at the time I figured it would be a waste of time. I happened to catch it on HBO and after a few minutes I relized that there was definately something fun about this movie. Well worth purchasing if you like movies like Friday or Don't be a menace to South Central while drinking your juice in the hood. It's just plain fun. Oh yeah, incase you haven't noticed, Ice Cube and Master P both are actually very talented actors. I threw Ice Cube in because he makes a cameo appearance in this one."
1,What was the point,"I wasnt gonna even bother reviewing this mess, it was so ridiculous, but judging from the reviews I guess it appealed to the audience it was trying to reach. I hope that Master P would be banned from making anymore movies but I am only dreaming, I am glad I only watched it on VHS and didnt pay any money because I would have really been upset. I thought it was going to be funny like Friday but it was demeaning and embarrassing to African Americans. 1 star is being to generous for this travesty, 0 stars would have been too much for this mess."
1,COULD ONLY STAND TO WATCH 10 MINUTES OF THIS,MASTER P JUST CAN'T RAP OR ACT AT ALL. AFTER 10 MINUTES I QUIT WATCHING IT. IT GOT REALLY BORING WHEN MASTER P SAID I GOT THE HOOK UP WITHIN MINUTES APART. I DOUBT IT THAT I WILL EVER SEE A MOVIE WITH MASTER P IN IT AGAIN.
1,really bad&dumb,this is one of the worst films ever.if you have some Money can't you get a script? a solid director? and some real actors? i don't know what is worse the film or the soundtrack?
1,"P does anything for money, and this is an example!","This movie didn't have a great point, but it was a great money making scheme!"
4,I Got The Hook Up DVD,Good movie for those of you that loved Master P and the No Limit Records Recording label in the late 90's
3,masterp,"Whats up the nolimit crew I like all ya songs ,videos and man I really like ya movies that you come out with. My brother got eveything that you came out with hes 15 and my name is pe'lar im 10 my friend at school thats in the 4th with me have dreams about you every night and says your her lover. So anyways IM BEGIN YOU to write me back at JFullilove@aol.com. See Ya I kind of do too!"
2,"Not sound effects, but music, and silly electronic at that...","Could have been lost in translation, and the gun on the cover, but I thought it was going to be sound effects. Instead, it is silly synthesizer music."
2,Shallow Treatment of a Vital Subject,"The people described in this book are true heroes, and their stories make me feel humbled and ashamed. But the book attempts to describe 50 different people. Each person gets 3-6 pages, and at least one of the pages is a photograph, leaving room for only a short, unsatisfying glimpse of each life story.The flyleaf states that ""'Speak Truth to Power' is accompanied by a major exhibition opening at The Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., then traveling nationally."" It almost appears that the story is secondary to the photographs--a pity."
5,5-Star Crystal,This is a beautiful crystal cross and amazon offers it at a very competive price -- especially since no tax was charged and it qualified for free shipping. My only complaint was that the box could have been in a little better condition -- possibly because this was the last one in stock. The glue on one of the seams wasn't holding but was easily fixed.
1,Black Hills Ankle Bracelet,"The bracelet is attractive enough, however, the clasp broke after only wearing the bracelet for about two weeks. It cost $11 to put a new clasp on it!"
4,A good read for those who enjoy horsey relationships,"This book is so much about life and how horses too as ""prey animals"", are so much like us humans. Horses, need to know through our servant leadership that we care most about our relationship with them. I see so much of how our Heavenly Father relates to us in this manner also. A good, insightful read from the mind of a horseman, who may not have intended for these insights to shine through, but who recognizes fully that genuine relationships matter."
5,STOP PUNISHING YOUR HORSE!,"A wonderfully written book full of thought provoking concepts. If you think that slapping your horse around to assert your dominance is the way to teach your horse, then you had better read this book. If you wonder why your horse has behavior problems, then it's time to read this book and evaluate your behavior. This is a must read for all horse people. I highly recommend all books by Mark Rashid."
5,Inspirational Training Methods!,"I received this book as a Christmas gift, and read through it in one night. It is a wonderful, must have book for any horse person! I run a non-profit horse rescue ,and this book has both inspired and intrigued me. I cant wait to start applying the methods to our rescued animals. Chapter by Chapter, as I was reading, his examples and methods really struck home...the reason behind ""why"" horses act the way they do and how to understand it all. Very eye-opening and very well written - funny, down to earth and informative! Five stars PLUS!"
5,Horses Never Lie: The Heart of Passive Leadership,This is Mark Rashid's 3rd book of four he's written. His fifth is due on in October 2005. He is SO Insightful about horses and how they relate to each other with actions and movement.The passive leadership he speaks of makes so much sense. To have a good relationship with your horse and for him to WANT to be with you because he Trusts you is the ultimate.If only I can remember 1/4 of what he's written I'll be a much better horse owner and rider. His books are truly amazing truths about his every day learning from horses he's known.
5,As engaging as the first book!,"As much as ""Considering the Horse"" opened our eyes to a gentle, understanding method of interacting with our horses (I shouldn't use the word ""training!"") ""Horses Never Lie"" exposes us to a new philosophy of what we should be for our equine partners - kind, understanding, supportive. Mark effectively debunks the ""Be the Alpha Horse"" theory, and offers an approach that the horse understands, that helps the horse WANT to be with you. He becomes your friend, not a subservient being that should obey. It has opened my eyes - again! If you're at all interested in Natural Horsemanship, buy this book - TODAY!"
5,Fabulous book!,"I've learned more from this book than all the lessons I've had and books I've read combined. This man is incredible - and what's more incredible to me is the number of times a lightbulb went off over my head with regards to something a horse was doing that I misinterpreted or just flat out missed. He's made me a more understanding, patient, and considerate rider. I highly recommend this book to anyone whether an old hand or a beginning rider. Fabulous book!"
5,Mark Rashid is great,Rashid has a great sence of horsemanship. Most of what he writes can also be applied to life.
1,"Author Lies About Horses, Delusional Horsemanship","Horse's don't lie?, but people sure do lie, especially to themselves and this book is full of lies about horses and their relationships with humans that I am sure the delusional author really believes. The author's lying problem is anthropomorphing horses and their behavior. If you want to really learn about horse behavior and horsemanship with no anthropomorphic nonsense, horse whispering, psychobabble, mind reading, astrology, or anything but science based knowledge then read the books by Paul McGreevy. If you believe that Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny,and the Tooth Fairy are real then you will really enjoy Horses Never Lie."
5,My Review of Horses Never Lie,"This is an excellent book that is huge eye opener in not only how to ""read"" a horse's body language, but how horses interact with one another. I loved the format of this book, as it teaches through stories, not through step-by-step instruction. The stories were extremely interesting and very well-written, so it held my attention throughout. This book does a fantastic job of interpreting the seemingly complex hierarchical order within a horse herd, as well as how the herd views the ""alpha"" horse. Through story after story, the author was able to bring home to the reader, the affects different types of ""alpha"" leaders can have on a horse, and will make you think about what type of ""alpha"" leader you want to be. I highly recommend this book to ANY horse owner."
5,Most Helpful of Horse Books,"As a novice horse person, I have purchased many books on horse behavior and training. Of all the books I have, I have learned the most from Mark Rashid's books. He doesn't tell you ""how to"" but he gives you enough insight to develop your own how to. The most helpful thing I learned is that I don't have to win every ""little"" battle with the horse. It's a process, and one I've enjoyed more since I am no longer trying to be the alpha-mare; a concept that never worked for me. I will be recommending these books to all of our 4-H kids."
3,Not a How to.. but a nice complement,"Mark has written a nice book, not clearly a manual or a How to.. book but a text full of experiences. It's not literature about horses but a book about different horses and experiences, giving clues about horsenalities and personalities. A fun and interesting book."
3,Horses Never Lie: The Heart of Passive Leadership,"The book, as stated on the invoice, was used but was to appear essentialy ""clean and near new"". Not so! There were dirty smudges, two underlined pages and a dogearred page. I was disappointed that it was not as advertised."
5,loved it,I've been and still a horse lover and love to read about horse this is a must buy I couldn't put down.A+++ seller
5,Excellent book,The author shares the events that brought him to his conclusions about horse training. There is something for everyone in this book. Anyone working with horses should read it.
5,Engaging Author,"Mark Rashid's easy style of writing and his interesting personal stories made it hard for me to put the book down. So much of what he wrote really resonated with my own feelings about creating a partnership with my horse. His concept of passive leadership was described in a way that was easily recognizable in many personal situations of my own experiences. I am looking forward to reading more of Mark's books and have already ordered some. These are not the ""training manuals"" of other trainers and his experiences and approach makes me look forward to training my horse and building on the bond of friendship/partnership."
5,Passive leadership is for more than just horses.,"Horses Never Lie : The Heart of Passive Leadership by Mark Rashid is easy, enjoyable reading and maintains your interest through a thought provoking comparison of leadership styles and the results achieved. Mark Rashid demonstrates how to become a passive leader using stories that demonstrate how positive, passive influence changes unwilling or indifferent participants into enthusiastic partners. Even though the book is written about the reaction of horses to different styles of leadership, the same principles apply to people. The principles in the book would be equally applicable to parenting, child care, youth leadership, and business management. All these roles could benefit from ""Passive Leadership"". Highly Recommended !!!"
3,"Ma Vlast distant, Bartered Bride beautiful","I agree with the other reviews. The orchestra sounds distant in Ma Vlast, which is rather frustrating. While the Bartered Bride is beautiful. Not sure the imbalance makes this CD worth buying."
3,a very general reference,The book arrived quickly and in excellent shape. It is basically a reference for references and ended up not really being what I was looking for since it was too general. The information will quickly need to be updated to keep up with the more easily accessible and fast-paced world of electronic literature.
2,The PS 6 Bible is a fat disappointment,"I prefer to use software books as references. Many of the ""Bible"" books are really useful this way. But in order for that to be so, the book has to have a decent index. This ""Bible"" fails miserably on that count. An example: I tried to look up ""Acrobat"" to see if I could save a file in the PDF format from Photoshop. Adobe Acrobat files are a standard in the publishing industry these days. There is actually a page and a half in the Bible on saving as a PDF, but there is no entry for ""Acrobat"" or ""Adobe Acrobat"" in the skimpy index. The last ""Photoshop Bible"" that I bought was for PS 3. A lot has changed in the program since then. Versions 5, 5.5, and 6 of PS have all been major revisions, but there is relatively little new material in the PS 6 Bible compared to the PS 3 Bible. Save your money."
4,Big and necessary book!,"I've upgraded to Photoshop 6 from version 5 and 5.5. Still as an ACE I think this book is very useful, it reveals issues that might be difficult to understand in this very new version of Photoshop.I think this book is very useful (both for the novice and for the) experienced user. Deke Mc Clelland is always very well informed, and manages to a great extent describing complicated issues. (Eyes perception of colors, and then how monitor shows them, and how they are on paper.)The book lacks a bit because most of the images are in b/w. There are also more - humorous - authors on Photoshop out there, but if you want very much information for your money, this is your first choice!"
5,Good value and comprehensive.,"'You get what you pay for' sometimes, as in this case, does happen. This is a very comprehensive yet straightforward book to work your way through. It's often too chummy and long winded in its delivery; IDG's style, I suppose. I was pleased with all the details Deke McClelland incorporated in the text, even down to the rarely mentioned preference settings for the Export-Clipboard and Backwards Compatibility options, which can save so much hassle and unnecessarily large file sizes. Yes, the Photoshop 6.0 Bible ain't no pocket-book and is fairly expensive. Nevertheless you could quickly spend much more on an assortment of lesser works."
4,Twice as Many Enemies,"Steven Marshall has seen the horrors of submarine warfare first-hand. Now, he's been put in charge of a captured German U-boat, and he and his crew have a top secret mission to fulfill. The catch: his own Royal Navy comrades don't know he's one of them, and the Germans are figuring out one of their subs is behaving strangely. Marshall has no friends to rely on. More even than the usual submarine commander, he is entirely on his own.Douglas Reeman keeps finding new twists and turns to make his war-at-sea novels entertaining, and in this one, the psychological terrors of submarine warfare are magnified by the fact that sometimes it's your own Navy dropping depth bombs on you. By my count, this is Reeman's fourteenth novel, and he's definitely got his craft figured out by this point. You'll be drawn into this one."
3,"Ok, but not great","I also really wanted to like this book, and there are many parts of the story that I could enjoy. Many historical points are correct, but there are so many elements that are off. Several of the conversational exchanges between the characters are not only very modern, but very western as well. I listened to the audio book, and while the performer was interesting & engaging, her incorrect pronunciation of words like ""Kyoto"" really grated on me. In the end, I get the feeling that it was a good effort, but not an excellent one. I'm glad I checked it out from the library instead of buying it."
3,"Enjoyable, but slow","I love Japanese tea ceremony, so I was happy when this book came out. There were many informative moments, of which I enjoyed, but there were times when I had to force myself through a chapter. I think that it was obvious that The Teahouse Fire was her first book. Those who are not looking for a rainy day read but an informative book about japanese tea that is fiction will like this."
1,Lynne's review,"The Teahouse Fire is sitting on my nightstand halfway read, and sadly I will never finish it. During the first few chapters I hoped it might become interesting. It had the potential to be a good story as the motherless girl was shipped off on her own, into a strange new culture. But once she got settled in, the story got horribly, terribly boring. More and more characters were introduced in each paragraph, and there were no reasons to care about them. I do consider myself a good reader, yet found the text incredibly difficult to read. This is only the second novel I have EVER given up on, and that does make me sad. Reading should be so much fun that you can't wait to find out what happens next, instead of forcing yourself to read more!"
3,interesting history,"This books provides an inside view to the meeting of the old ways of Japan with the new ways of the West. It follows the speaker as she grows up as a ""displaced foreigner"" in Japan trying to make her own fate. She romantically idealizes several of the women in her life, often to her own peril. Men are potrayed rather negatively throughout the book, however. This prejudiced view of the sexes in my opinion lessened the credibility of the speaker. Parts of the novel are tedious but I suppose describing tea ceremony has to be."
1,book for women,"I only read the first 100 pages. It is a book for women to read...about tea ceremonies, Japanese culture and relationships. However, I received the book in a timely fashion and it was in great shape. No complaints."
2,Japanese story,At the beginning I found the book interesting but after the girl has been in Japan a while I found it a bit dragging on too much and lost interest. But if you like to learn about Japan and the culture it's a good read.
5,Keeps your Interest and FUN!,"Divine Divinity is an RPG with more than just the usual 'find the magic stuff' type quests. In fact, there are a plethora of interesting things to do within the rich world of this game.You have the option of playing a male or female character; and one of three types: Magic-user, Warrior or ""survivor"" (thief). I've not gotten too far in the game, and yet it is of such a quality that I am drawn to it, even though I have tended to get tired of other RPG's quite easily. This one is holding my attention probably because the options for play are extensive. Skills, that in other games are tied to one character type, are wide-open in this game. Perhaps you'd rather play a mage that can kick-butt? You can do that here.The score is a perfect accompaniment to the atmosphere of where you are in the game, and the NPC's interaction has been intelligent.It's a great game, and I recommend it... and just for reference, I'm a 44 year old female. :)"
3,Great RPG with a lousy ending,"I loved this RPG. It has an amazing amount of gameplay, with a great storyline, and a reasonably good interface. Because it was so addictive, I probably played it way too much. However, the ending is a complete let down. I won't give away the ending, but nothing is explained, the animation is extremely short, and it's very obvious that Larian studios was just trying to hook people for a sequel. Disappointing to say the least."
1,This game is terrible,"This game is horrible, I played this for about 3 hours and was extermily bored. If you want to get a good game look at Diablo or Icewind Dale 2, they're alot better."
1,Doesn't even install properly!,"All I get are CRC errors when I try to install on my laptop, a HP I purchased last year. The drivers are updated and I have DirectX 9 installed, so there shouldn't be any problems. I tried contacting tech support several days ago, but they still haven't gotten back to me. I really want my money back but I know that's not going to happen. Just avoid this game if you have a HP laptop, because it will probably not work."
4,A must for all rpg/action lovers out there ..,"Well i bought the game a few weeks ago and completed the game yesterday.If you are looking for a game that offers many many challenges and quests, advanced interaction with the DD-world with great graphics then this game is for you. After choosing your character you have the ability to teach it skills of various types; mage, thief and warrior; The good thing is that you can combine all skill classes to you desires. This game litterally offer many many hours of game play, it will take you nearly 7 days and night to finish the game. The story is pretty nice, and to be honest you won't be bored for a single moment.The game offers no multiplay however but regardless is still a fine single player game.This game has some similar aspects to diablo two, but the game-quality itself is of a higher quality whereas diablo 2 is primarily focussed on skills and experience gathering.Definately a good game."
5,a review of the normal,"now first off i want to say that this is a GREAT GAME. This is the best rpg i have seen in a VERY long time. (of course this isn't saying much cause im still in my teens) It has great graphics. the action is great but controllable(can pause) and the skill chart is accessable through any character. there are at least a hundred side quests and im only half way through(including sub-quests) HOWEVER i do have 1 complaint , the level system. It is based on all other ones, gain experence and at a ridiculous number, and at that number you level up and gain 5 stat points with those stat points you can use them tword streagth(boots attack and stamina) agility(increases accuracy and dodge ability) constitutian(vitality and stamina) and mana(spell power) the main problem is that by the 15 level you have to get 500000 points."
4,Fast Delivery and Product Just as Stated,"Product was ordered 11-7 and on 11-14, I was playing Divine Divinity...COOL!! Everything was as advertised and more. Recommend this seller (uspsman) 100% plus!Graphics are a bit funky but it is REALLY fun. Much like the original Diablo."
4,Fantastic 2D graphics,"This game has unbelievably gorgeous 2D graphics. The attention to detail is awesome. Special effects sparkle and glitter everywhere. The soundtrack also is magnificent. But other than the graphics and the soundtrack, much of this game is CRPG by numbers, something like a beautified and simplified version of the Baldur's Gate series. Multiplayer game fans may be disappointed that Divine Divinity is for solo play only. Lastly, I have to warn you that playing this addictive game from start to the finish is an accomplishment that may take up to 100 hours of your good time."
5,Good Stuff,A street smart book that educated me and amused me. Good Stuff. This guy knows a lot and can write
4,Taxi Driver...,"Fascinating and at times chilling account of what it's like to drive a cab overnight in a big city (in this case, Toronto). The author in one chapter, offers a list of the various kinds of ""eccentric"" people one tends to meet when running the meter on a graveyard shift."
5,Very Pretty!!!,"Ok.I have always thought that mermaids were the coolest.Fairies too.They are beautiful,and magestic.When I heard that there was a Barbie Mermaidia line,I wanted to see the movie really bad.She is really pretty.Her tail espessaily!Her painted body consisted of these colors:blue and pink.Her eyes are pretty.The sparkles are the magical touch.I wish they made a prince.Thats the only thing that this set lacks.Although I havent seen all the toys,I dought thet have it.I seen the movie!It`s awesme!!"
2,my daughter really wanted this mermaid,My daughter really wanted this doll. She saw it on a brochure in the dvd case. So we looked it up and bought it. Its fine she's happy. I hope I don't accrue any bad karma purchasing one more piece of plastic that she played with for about a week before losing in the bottom of her toy box.
1,kind of gross,"i like the other two mermaids, but this one looks like it painted it's body blue and it is wearing nothing! i think it is dumb."
1,VEEEEEEEEEEEERY SLUTTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!EWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!,WHAT AN UGLY MERMAID DOLL.I HATE IT SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH.DONT GET HER.BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
3,Durability problem,"I think this doll is incredibly fun and beautiful, but somehow the tail broke off the very first day my 4 year old daughter played with it. She loves it anyway, she insists. She just screamed with pleasure after seeing the hair turn purple and the tattoos appear after about 3 minutes in the freezer.I don't know how it got broken, or how rough my daughter might have been, but it seems strange that it would break so quickly. Disappointing."
4,"An adorable doll for little girls, but almost twice the cost now from when I bought it here","The Barbie Fairytopia collection is enjoyed by pre-adolescent girls of all ages, as witnessed by my toddler aged granddaughter and eight and ten year-old nieces who love them. However, this particular doll, priced at $13.99 from Amazon almost two years ago when I bought it, is now almost twice that at $24.99. Why?Although it is colorful, adored by little girls everywhere, and durable, this specific doll can be bought for much less new on eBay, and I imagine from other sellers as well. I also bought the Fairytopia Enchanted Meadow playset, as well as other collections of dolls, all which the girls absolutely loved. Recommended for little girls who want to be mermaids everywhere."
4,"I gave it a FOUR, but it's more like 3 and 1/2","Cohen writes a good book on negotiating. It's definitely a good start. He uses plenty of proper analogies (at times perhaps pointless) and has very good points to make. After reading this book, you will definitely come away with a feeling of a better negotiator.I do not rate this boook as a ""FIVE"" because 1) the book is a bit out of date (1980) although it is still applicable today, 2)it is more general than I expected and does not cover the little things like body language, etc in as much detail as I would have prefered.This having been said. I would recommend the book but don't stop here."
2,its advice from an argumentative old man,"The art of writing and negotiation has come a long way since the ole Herb wrote this book. His stories present him as an argumentative, cheap, old-fashioned man with a distant relationship with his wife.His first kibble of advice is to annoy a salesperson at a one-price store (read as ""department store"") until they eventually agree to knock a few bucks off the price. I guess this supposed millionaires time is not that expensive."
3,a good insight into what's really going on,"Herb Cohen is a guy that you like, he's very personable and this shows in his book, in fact you can see much of his negotiation tools being used by him to sell his own strategies to you in the book :), he makes the book very personable and human. There's definetly some good advice and strategies we can get from his life and his experiences. But i felt it is mostly him ranting about his own adventures or encounters. With his unique personality his outlook has proven successful, but i don't know how applicable these tools would be to everyone, meaning you may be able to save a few bucks but you won't become a millionare from this book. It does explain a general mindset to approach all negotiations which im sure will make me a more successful negotiator, i just wish he was more clear in how to apply it in my life instead of hearing all his past stories which i cant relate to."
3,You Can Negotiate Anything,"The book reinforced many learnings from my experiences negotiating with domestic and overseas companies in most cases. However, I did not feel that some of the examples given were the best advice - they would not have worked well or would have backfired in many of the cases I experienced, particularly with Asian companies. Otherwise, the book was informative, educational, and offered some humor to make the experience fun."
2,Old and not that good.,This book is very old and dated. It also has some pretty shaky advice like telling you to put a dent in the product you are trying to buy so you can get a discount. It also tells you to waste a bunch of the salesperson's time to try to get them to give you a deal. I had to force myself to finish the book because it just wasn't very good (and that is saying a lot because on average I read about 150 pages a day). At least it was cheap. I'm giving it a 2 star review because it wasn't horrible (which would be a 1 star review) but it wasn't even close to average. I would not read this book again and would not recommend it to anyone; might give it to the library.
4,Good introductory book to negotiation,This book is a good introductory book to negotiation. The style of writing is clear and the chapters are sprinkled with humour. Definitely a good buy for beginners in negotiation.I am giving it a four star rather than a five star is because the materials presented therein are very elementary technical wise.P.
2,Whatever happened to simplicity?,"Here are some words from the Big Printer in the Sky:""The ability to simplify means to eliminate the unnecessary so that the necessary may speak."" -Hans HoffmanBy the time I got to the dynamite the gun powder was wet and soggy."
5,"Overlook the picture on the cover, It's a great book","Herb Cohen wrote a great book. This book delivers what it promises and will help keep you from being taken to the cleaners, whether buying a car, home, whatever. This book is worth every penny"
3,Good - but VERY dated examples,"The tips and strategies are probably timeless; however, the examples and references are so old that it's distracting. Instead of helping to reinforce his points, the examples wound up making me think back 30 years to put them into context. This book needs to be updated!"
4,Good light for the money,"Good light, a bit smaller than I thought it would be. Works well as a dusk to dawn porch light. Works well with CFL light bulbs!"
5,Better then other mineral makeup brands,Mineral Essence is better then Bare Minerals and Sheer Coverage.There are alot of really good brands that are avaliable but they are not marketed and advertised which is why you have to seek and try it for yourself.This one has a featherly texture compared to sheer cover which has a thicker coating.Rated by me1.mineral essence2.bare minerals3.sheer cover(sheer cover sells a good Brush set)
5,Superb performances.,"Carlo Maria Giulini may not be as well known as many glamorous jet-set conductors, but he was one of the half dozen or so greatest conductors of the 20th century, nevertheless. And he had a special affinity for both the symphonies on this CD. Giulini's performance of Schubert's ""Unfinished"" Symphony is simply sublime. No other conductor can match him in this work. His performance of the ""New World"" symphony is also outstanding. It is, I must admit, a bit more Brahmsian than idiomatically Czechish -- but it is, nevertheless, magnificent. I beg you to listen to it."
3,"Nice case, but small","This is a nice camera case, however, I like to keep a spare battery in the case, and it's too small for that."
5,M-I-C-K-E-Y M-O-U-S-E!!!!!!!!,This is such a great book with great information about the disney company and of course mickey! and lots of great pictures!
5,well done,I choose it out of many I have in my wish list becuase it was a great price for a book that has quality. I looked at the 1975 books(collectors) and decided to go with the newer book bcause of its new material. The books is very nice and i'm very pleased to have it in my library
4,petra verkaik,"petra verkaik , an ex-playmate looks beautioful and steals her scene.. how this woman doesn't win oscars,grammys and emmys is beyond me."
1,THIS PIE WOULD BE GOOD...IF IT HAD MEAT IN IT!,"OH! Deary dear! Auntie Lee's Meat Pies is one of those sobad it's BAD films! I watched this because it hadKaren Black from Trilogy of TERROR fame and she was inHouse of 1,000 corpses. This however is a very undercookedpie! This film is a worthless Sweeney Todd ripoff! Blackruns a boarding house where guests end up as ingredients of herpopular pot pies. The comic cast is given very little to workwith and you can see their pain as they try to get throughthis drivel. Watch this again??? Hell! I'd rather fold laundry."
3,Contemporary record of observations,"I live in the SF bay area, so this is of interest to me - the event that shaped 20th century San Francisco culture, geography, commerce and politics. It was good reading, but the narratives jumped around and presumed that the reader knew the layout of 1906 San Francisco streets and neighborhoods. It became confusing as commotion jumped from one area to the next. I also felt that the book skipped the 'human drama' element - how the quake of '06 impacted the average citizen during the quake, the fires and the rebuilding of the west coast's greatest city at the time."
1,What?,"Not at all coherent. The narrative is all over the place. Reads like a 10th grade history paper and not a book written by a professional writer.If it wasn't free, I'd demand my money back. Unfortunately, I can't get that time back."
5,"Thurough, conscise, eloquent, and complete.","This basic book of Buddhist Concepts covers The Seals of the Law, The Four Noble Truths, The Law of Causation, The Twelve Linked Chain Of Dependent Origination, The Three Treasures, The Eightfold Path and the threefold learning - teachings that are common to all sects of Buddhism and foundaitonal to a comprehehsive practice.I am in deep gratitude to this book for its non sectarian approach to the transmition of a framework for the structure of the Dharma that I can use to deepen my insight into an appreciation of and most importantly practical application of a Western tradition of Buddhist practice.It is not the moon it only points, but it points most clearly."
1,Buyer Beware!,"I have been extremely happy with my Sennheiser PMX 60 headphones. A friend wanted a pair and mistakenly ordered these. The headset is incredibly uncomfortable, and the ear pieces do not fit well over the ear. They kind of turn up at the bottom. Very poorly made. I wouldn't touch these gobblers with a ten foot audio cable. Spend the extra $2 and get the wonderful PMX 60s."
5,Wonderful!,"From the moment I heard about the premise of this book I waited with anticipation. What joy that it fulfilled everything I expected. Susan is a gifted writer and brings these women's words to life. The book made me desperate for more, both in depth and scope. As easy to take as a novel, it is a history lesson - should I say HERstory - and then some. Superb work."
3,"Engaging, if Also a Little Repetitive","Susan Orlean is indeed one of the best magazine writers out there right now--one of the best catches of Tina Brown's from the Dark Ages of the New Yorker! And this book is definitely a must for anyone interested in the contemporary nonfiction world. However, by limiting the collection to merely profiles, Orlean has limited the reader's appreciation of her great talents. The books ends up repeating itself too much."
1,What Happened to Our Susan Orlean?,"Before Susan Orlean became self-obsessed, she was a journalist who was posed to inherit the literary tradition of Didion, McPhee, Capote, Wolfe, etc. But something's happened. With the fluke popularity of the Orhard Thief--a very uneven book, one of those extended New Yorker articles that shuld have been left as is because it now reads as merely a struggle to fill up space--she's turned herself into a New York, high powered, high profile ""celebrity"" writer who seems to have lost touch with the small, quiet reporter who was fascinated first and foremost with her subjects...not herself. This book is a disappointment. How telling of her new attitude toward her subjects that on the cover of a book about OTHER people (""Encounters with Extraordinary People"") she's posed seductively and made-up to the hilt. This is a shame of a book. I once adored this writer's older work."
3,"OK, Not Great","I began this book, a collection of essays about people Orlean had interviewed, with enthusiasm, but finished it with relief. The essays were well-written, but soon began to seem too much alike to be of great interest. I ended up skipping some that were not about subjects I found intrinsically interesting.Several of the essays date from the 1980s, and read as though they did. For example, the author's observations regarding 1980s pop singer Tiffany seemed dated, in light of the current slick marketing of teen stars (or acts aimed at the teen market). It would have been worth making some effort to update the stories, and place them in some kind of context. Instead, this is just a collection of previously published pieces, not all of which should have been brought back to light."
1,a disappointment,"Such a great title. A couple of good articles, particularly about the surfers and the matador, and then nothing but lots of magazine filler kind of stories. A disappointment."
5,A totally and completely amazing book,"Sure to be a best seller, this collection of previously published magazine articles is Orlean at her most radiant. In spite of the fact that I am not drawn to collections, I found this book so full of evocative, brilliant and insightful stories that I couldn't, simply wouldn't, put it down. Her writing is so descriptive, so visual and so appreciative of all those she profiles, it makes me question whether I actually see the world through the same lens. Perhaps now I will."
2,The Dreaded Urge to Collect That Which Should Not Be,"Susan Orlean's magazine pieces (usually in The New Yorker) define a certain bright, glossy, mannered high standard in magazine entertainment. At best they're very fluent and well-reported, at worst they cloy and preen with a glib, narcissistic flatness that may not bug you too much until you try to read the piece a second time. (In this respect Orlean and Adam Gopnick are the Homecoming Queen and King of enamelled profundity in literary journalism.) She (or her editors) generally choose her subjects wisely, so novelty and variation disguise her remarkably narrow range. Will someone want to read this stuff in 10 or 20 years? I don't want to read them again now. Write that subscription renewal check for The New Yorker, but save the hardcover bucks for writing that isn't trapped in a self-enchanted hall of mirrors."
1,booooooring!,"Another book about Susan Orlean, by Susan Orlean ... yes, she can write, but only when the topic reflects back onto her somehow. Part of John McPhee's artistry was a total lack of self-absorbtion; Orlean suffers from the opposite problem. And unfortunately for us, her life is just plain not interesting enough. And is that her on the cover? UGH."
1,yawn.,"This book was recommended to me by a friend in book club. She was convinced that it would change my mind about short stories. It did not. I thought it was terribly boring, and not at all extraordinary. Poor character development, if at all. Not that funny, not very interesting. Basically just a compilation of previously printed magazine articles.No one in my book club bothered to finish it. Would have rather spent my wasted time scrubbing toilets with a toothbrush."
3,"what happened to p,pp and ppp and mystery?","I am a 58 year old professional orchestral musician, and I have played with the best: Gilels, Bachauer, Axe, Watts, Gelber,etc..When I hear this Debussy recording, I keep waiting for QUIET and mystery, and don't get it. There is a lack of dynamic extreme, and it kills the music. I would rather plunk through these at my pedestrian pianist skills than listen to someone with chops and little imagination."
2,An Ok Game,"When I recently bought sudden strike 2 I was a little disapointed. In comparison to some games such as Talonsofts west front, the player does not seem to have much control over the battle. I also thought that the units were rather small and hard to see. The Editors also seem complicated and hard to understand. However the game does have good graphics and effects. If you are a real WW2 buff you might enjoy it."
2,disappointing,"WWII strategy games are my favorite thing, but this one left me unsatisfied. The game model has sacrificed a lot of historical accuaracy - not surprising in a RTS game. If this translated into a fun, playable game it would be an acceptable trade-off, but I find the playability to be rather poor. My least favorite aspect is that all in-game tactics revolve around LOS (line of sight) to potential targets. But the LOS model is ludicrous suffering from a very Borg-like situation where if one of your units can see a target then magically all of your units can see the target. A reluctant negative review from me."
2,Really Bad,"When I usually buy games I look at the package and when I see reviews on it that give the game praise it usually helps. This box has two good reviews, but this game is just terrible. It involves no strategy whatsoever. You just gather your group of ""ants"" together and make the walk to an area, if they see the enemy first, they'll kill them, but if not, your guys die. You can't set up flanks or any kind of strategy. Avoid this game and stick with the Close Combat trilogy."
1,On the way to out,"These monitors were beautiful when they were new. If you can find a new one in a box it may be OK but the used ones can have LCD problems like the one I got. In my case the seller would not take the return and Apple is the only place that will fix them. The current cost of repairs is a flat $650.00 in (2012). The smaller ones are now considered ""vintage"" and Apple longer repairs them. So it will probably not be long before these are no longer accepted for repair.My advice: think really hard before buying used and if at all possible preview the screen for dim or discolored spots before you lay down $1000+ for one of these."
5,"Perfect size, great quality.","At first I thought this screen was going to be too big, but after a few days it felt just right. It's sharp and contrasty, and you can't really have enough screen real estate to keep multiple editor windows open. It does produce quite a bit of heat - hopefully Apple will come out with an LED lit version soon. Until then, this certainly beats the 23 inch, which was already a great screen. Apple uses high quality LCD panels and the image quality you get in return is very good. This is the perfect screen if you have to stare at one for most of the day."
5,Windows XP with an NVidia Quadro FX 4000,"This monitor works great on Windows XP with an NVidia Quadro FX 4000. If it's in your budget, buy it today. There is no downside to this monitor. I have no reservation in recommending it. It is one of the most expensive monitors on the market but I consider it an exceptional value. Everyone who has seen the monitor is stunned by the size, brightness, quality and response time."
5,Best screen ever,"I was concerned that Apple would discontinue the 30"" like they did the 23"" without warning, so went ahead and treated my self to an early Christmas present, best decision I ever made, this screen is magnificent, just the real-estate upgrade from my 23"" makes me happy everyday and afterall its all about being happy, I rate this a buy buy buy"
2,Beware!,"Be careful with this product. There are a number of problems present in the current model of the 30"" ACD.The most notable one is the famous 'pixel-dancing' or flickering problem. You can read all about it in the following Apple discussion thread:[...]Scroll down to the end and you'll see that this problem is still very much present in these displays.I'm now going for my second replacement since I purchased the original display, and I hope I get a decent display this time. It seems to be a hit or miss situation, I'm afraid.Despite this, however, if you do receive one of the good displays, you'll absolutely love it. Just make sure you buy it from somewhere you can obtain a replacement and, in the worst of cases, a refund."
2,Buy the Extra Warranty Coverage,"I am an Apple fan, as I think their software is the best. But my experience with the hardware has been mixed. Two years ago I bought a 23"" flat screen Apple monitor. It has been lightly used but when I came back from a trip recently it would not turn on. Dead as a doornail. Looking online caused me to realize I was not the Lone Ranger. Many people had similar issues with this or similar models. Not good for a $900 item. I had a Mac Mini and the DVD drive died after a little more than a year. The motherboard on my powerbook failed after 2 and a half years. Powerbook power adapters have been notorious for failure. So be warned and be careful. They are great when they work, anger inducing when they do not."
2,Broken Apple Cinema HD,My 30in Apple Cinema display has a prob - flickering and dancing pixels.I am on the way to the store.
3,Good but way OVERPRICED,"No doubt this is a gorgeous flat panel LCD. Wish it was available in a glossy non-matte finish. The problem is that this LCD is WAY overpriced. Think about it, for $1800 you can buy a 46-52'' LCD TV nowadays and your only getting a 30'' LCD here with no TV. With TV prices and technological advances, this LCD should be no more than $600 - $700 if you think about it. I would totally wait for prices to drop or for new models to come out. Apple is due to come out with new models soon."
4,Preview Of the new Apple Cinema Dsiplay,"Pros-1)great thin design2)biggest HD LCD Display ever3)Wonderful Picture Quality amazing!4)has firewire inputs5)Can hook up additional display WOW!Cons-1)Can't Be used With PC-(but the 20"" and 23"" can)2)Need different Graphic card just to use it? Why does the design serve as a problem to whom own a power book G4 and like to place it under their Display the New design prohibits this.Bottom_____________This is a great LCD display with amazing clearity,has Dule monitor support. but has to have all new graphics card and design proibits the place of your laptop to slide underneath the display.OVER ALL preview rating a 9.5 of 10.00"
2,The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens,The Seven Habits of Highly Effective TeensThe Seven Habits Of Highly Effective teens is a book that talks about things that teens do. It talks about why teens do the things they do. It also gives advice for teens. It shows you ways how to solve problems. In the book I liked The part where it gave advice and opinions for teens. I did not like the some of the stories because some were not very interesting. I think other teens should read it because they might get some of the advice they need by reading the book.
4,a good book for self help,The author starts the books very unusually......he starts it in first person...like he's your friend and that's hat makes the book even more interesting.....he even uses some very good examples that teens can relate to
4,bill wayne 7th grade ops,"The reason I had to read this book is because we need to read it today for school.We will get a quiz each day. Therefore I read to get a good grade.When I started to read the book I thought it was really funny and interesting. When finishing the book I thought that this book was the best book my teacher has ever assigned. I also thought of all the things I need to improve in my life. I recommend this book to everyone because everyone has problems in there lives. This book has cartoons, diagras.touching stories,quotes,life changing topics,and it is funny. All this in one book you got to get this book!"
5,This book is a must-have for every teen! Two Thumbs Up!!!!!!,I haven't even finnished reading the book yet but I already know how awesome it is. Sean Covey is an amazing writer and knows how to catch a teen's eyes. I love the quotes. The baby steps really help me understand the book better. This is definatly a must- have for every teenager in the planet!!!
5,Great Teen Book,If you are looking for a good uplifting book for a teen that has had a little trouble with there mindset this is a great book to buy!!!
3,My book review of the 7 habits,"My book review of the 7 habitsThe 7 habits book I read was O.K. It talked about what to do in a problem and how to solve a problem. It also talks about teens that had a similar problem and how they dealed with the problem. Then it talked about your health. It give tips of how you can take care of your heart and also about how you can watch your weight.My opinion about the 7 habits book is that it is helpful. The book gives much detail about the problems the teens had. The book was kind of boring sometimes but was also exciting. The book gave some helpful tips about all the problems you might come across in the future.The book was really fun the read. It was also very helpful. I enjoyed reading the 7 Habits Highly Effective teens. Some parts of the book had some humer and some parts had none at all, but was a good book to read."
1,an ok book not the best book,The book review on 7 habits. Sean Covey wrote it. The good point in the book is that it gives advice to teens with problems. The bad point is that some of the advice is dumb. The book is all right to read though.The book helps people with problems so it has to be good right. There are lots of little stories in the book too. The stories are about troubled teens. The teens that had problems solve it. If it was a bad thing the person will tell all the consequences.The writer wrights the book really good too. He wrights it as if he was a troubled person. He gets stories from troubled teens with problems. He gives some good advice to teens with problems. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to read it.
2,Slow to get started,I was expecting something 'similar' the the adult Seven Habits. I don't think this book became helpful untilabout page 60 when it started on Planning and writing down priorities.
2,missing pages -,I am disappointed that the missing pages were not caught before this book was shipped.The pages up to 40 are not there.
1,not text to speech!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought a Kindle so my son who is very smart but has dyslexia could benefit from the text to speech option on a Kindle to help him read a book. I chose this book as I thought it would be helpful for him. It wasn't until I downloaded it, did I realize that it wasn't text to speech. I know now to look for that when I purchase a Kindle book, but what a disappointment. He could have benefitted from the book."
1,The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens (Miniature Edition),"well i should have bought the original.i bought this for a friend in need of help and i liked the real book cuz it was well written and relate-able .but this book is a small edition and it only tell u what the 7 habits are...nothing else..i don't like it because beside intructions, we need inspirations and why we are the way we are."
4,Must read for Teens,"I bought this book to assist my 16 and 17 year old daughters to better organize themselves now so that when they get out in the ""Real World"" but they both said that the book has helped them better organize themselves emotionally, physically and mentally. They both thanked me with a hug and love. When I first bought it and handed it to them, they thought I was trying to tell them something negative and I told them both that they need to read the book and then tell me if that is what they still think, but they did not. I am very happy with this purchase."
5,Amazing Positive Influence,"This amazing book has taught me to be and think like a new and better person. I have more control on myself and I am much more win-win and have a positive influence on others. I do not indulge wholely into the 7 Habits yet but I have just finished the book and can notice the change already, I recommend it to anyone and everyone!"
4,Are you effective teen,I was given this book back in 2001 and it has helped me in ways. The 7 Habits are basic common sense explained in a very useful way that would be helpful to ANY teen I believe. I was 16 when I was given this book and I can honestly say that I can't put a price on the value of this masterpiece.[...]
5,Teen Angst ?,"At the ripe age of 23, I borrowed my 18 year old brother's copy of this book and was enthralled.I cant help but wonder what a difference this book would have made in my life if I had read it at age 14 and not ten years later. The layout of the book is fun and appeals to readers of any age. This makes it easier to read. One thing I have to say, is that this book is one of the most powerful positive thinking books on the market. Although it's aimed at teens, the values and tips can apply to anyone. I loved the little excercises which are still applicable. Sean's frankness on matters really inspired me. My favourite part of the book though is the real life stories he relates on how teenagers have overcome difficulties and still succeed in the end. A great read, highly recommended !"
1,Cartoons? Quotes? 128 pages? NOT,"This miniature edition, which I ordered by mistake, is nothing as advertised. There are no cartoons, quotes, it's short by about 20 pages, and the pages there are are tiny. When I opened it and scanned, I estimated the value to be 20 cents.I ordered this as a Christmas present for a teen, so now I have to find something more appropriate. So little Sean is a chip off the old block, all ads and hype, no follow through. Is this an example of a successful teen? I guess the answer is yes, at least financially. I, on the other hand, will not be reading books by either Sr or Jr. Bah."
1,The 7 Highly Effective Habits makes me want to ram a pencil in my eye,"This books is absolute bulls**t. Any idiot could tell you everything in this book, but it takes a special skill to write something that does it in a way that is so condescending and preachy. If you enjoyed this book than you, my friend, are in need of self-help."
5,7 Good Habits for Teens,"When I heard about this book I decided to try it. The language was easy to understand, the illustrations and the stories were interesting and appealing to young people. What I wanted to tell my students was told so much clearer and more interestingly by Sean Covey. I think this book should be read and studied by every young person, grades 6-12. It gives them an opportunity to THINK about their lives and their choices. The study graphics and suggestions can help young adults develop their own creed or mission statement. This can lead to a more fulfilling and succcessful life."
4,For the kids,"This is a great resource for our kids to use to get their teen years focused. It is written in a young, upbeat manner with fun quotes and clip art. It's also broken down in easy -to -read chapters. I got it for my 12 & 13 year old sons, but it touches on some issues that may be geared more for the 15 plus year old. I do like it, and would (and already have) recommend it to family & friends...and you."
3,Way of Life,"The book has taught me how to live my life. I do, know now how to take care of myself. I use manners and treat others equally. I learn to respect my mind and myself. I have been foreshadowing lately about my life.My family has seen changes in me. Flashbacks are a nightmare now and my life is a lot easier. I learn not to take my family for granted. My family and I get along great now that I've read this book. It is a lot easier to be happy anywhere anytime.I also learn to exercise my mind. My idioms have now come out clearly. I read and learn more. I know now that my mind is precious and still growing and not to abuse it. My mind is my tool.I recommend this book to you because it helps you understand your way of life.This book helps me understand my life and how I should take care of it. It taught me how learn the right way. I guarantee this story will change your life forever. Grab yourself a chair and this book and read."
5,what I think,"I read this book as a class assignment. I had never heard of this book before until my teacher introduced it to us. I didn't have a choice if I wanted to read it or not, it was for a grade. When I heard the tittle I thought it was another boring book. It would just give you the facts without any excitement on the way.I thought that I would find myself asleep while reading it. After I red this book it wasn't as boring as I thought. It was very interesting especially when they had stories of other teens going through the same thing. It wan't the most exciting book I have ever read but it wasn't boring either. I would recommend this book to every teen because it has important lessons we all can learn from. It teaches us how to build better relationships, discover your talents, accomplish your goals, the importance of working together, etc. This book will inspire you, and teach you important lessons. Christal"
4,bit much for my 12 year old,"My 12 year old got bored with it, she's probably too young for this book. I am hoping she will pick it up in a year or so. I thought it was interesting and usefull."
1,Abridged audio version is WAY TOO abridged,I selected the CD abridged version of this book after loving the book and wanting my son to get the content. The points were not developed or illustrated enough to have the content be memorable.
5,Very Well-written,"The book is great. I'm glad I read it because it really helped me with time-management. It is very easy to read with a lot of quotes, pictures, and good ideas. If you are a teenager, I suggest you read it."
2,review,The seller should tell you that this book is only 2x 2 1/2 inches in size. I bought this as a present and was very embarrassed when it arrived.
3,His Dad said it better.,"I think the original Seven Habits is not only more complete, profound, and instructional, but the reading level or style of it shouldn't really deter teenagers of average intelligence. The original Seven Habits is simple without being simplistic. Younger teenagers probably don't need to be reading books like these yet. Once they are grown up and have some sense of themselves and what their weaknesses and strengths are then they might have use for a book like this."
5,"Excellent, must read book","I'm almost fifteen, and I was given this book by my dad. I just finished reading it last night, and I think it is one of the best books I have ever read, in terms of trying to get a message over to someone, ESPECIALLY teenagers!! It's packed with invaluable advice and is put in a very interesting, funny and very creative way. Worth all the money you spend on it!!!!"
2,it's okay...if you are not forced to read it,"At my school we were forced to read this book and be tested on it, parts were funny and helpful but it was so boring, it could of been that I was forced to read it, but i was really boring to me because my friends and teachers would bug me if i didn't exactly fallow it, so what i say is don't MAKE your students/friend/children read it."
5,The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens,"My 15 yr old son, who struggles academically LOVES this book. It's very encouraging & helpful. I think the fact that he says he loves it, says it all!"
5,Great Motivational Book!,"I give this book 5 stars because I love what Mr. Covey did with it, the stories were touching and sometimes sad, the cartoons were funny, the book was great. It's not THAT similar to Chicken Soup For The Teenage Soul. This book isn't boring. I couldn't put it down at sometimes. If you asked me, I would say READ IT! I'm letting one of my friends borrow, she thought it would be boring, but it's not!"
2,Issues,This is a book that is inspiring but seems a 2 year old wrote this book but that is however my opinion
3,I wasn't impressed,"I bought this to give to my son who will be a teenager shortly. While the material is decent enough, I feel this book was really just written by someone to make money off his father's name. Secondly, the author makes it sound in the beginning that this book is really interesting and ""not boring like his dad's book"". It would be an adventure stuffed full of great quotes, full of cartoons and incredible stories of teens. Well, I found the book pretty boring although I did overall like the content."
5,My Fault,"This was a miniature book which if I had read the product description better I would have seen that. item arrived quickly which I love. My children did not want the book because it is hard to see but not the sellers fault, definitely my own."
3,Seven Habits of High Effective Teens,"Beware!!! This is the MINIATURE EDITION!!! I didn't read carefully and was surprised at the small size. My own fault, but...."
4,Great tool for teenagers,"some good tools that parents and teens should read togetherworkbook layout for teens to write in, liked this too"
4,seven habits of teens.,"very good book it is something simple and easy easy to read, understand and do.i would give it a thumbs up."
5,Awesome book!!,"I thought this book was excellent. You'll see others who didn't like this book, and I think that's because they didn't really get into it, and just scoffed at it instead, claiming that their problems were just too big. Many teenagers (including myself) don't alway realize that they often contribute to their own victimization, which is something Sean Covey points out in this book (and in simpler language than I just did!). Of course you can't just read this book and expect your life to be fixed! You have to put it into practice. If you really get into this book (which isn't hard to do - the stories and pictures are quite fun), I think you'll like it a lot. I love it."
5,Best Book Ever !,I completely fell in love with this book the second I started reading it. Sean is an amazing writer and wish someday to meet him. Everything in this book has helped me through real- life situations. A very important accomplishment was made becuase of this book and because I wanted it so badly; I made all a's and b's my ninth grade year. This was my first time in my life that I had made that great accomplishment.
1,No!,"Okay, I like hate being mean, but this certainly warrants it. This sketchy Covery character has not even a clue about what it means to be anything! You people who bought this book wasted precious time that you could have been out getting wasted or something else. God knows it would have helped you to have a drink rather than read this book. It's ignorant, preachy, and the man is a jerk. If you want to be a better person, turn to God. Or, do what I did. Join a sorority. That's what helps make me a better person. Not some preachy book."
1,Get a life,"Get a life, Sean Covey. Get out of this self-help business while you can, or you're going to end up living life out of a gutter. What will happen when this country realizes that it doesn't need crackpots like you to tell them how to succeed? Then you'll fall from your rich man's throne and see that you weren't any different or any more special than anybody else. You were just a crackpot. And I'll say good riddance!"
1,DON'T READ THIS BOOK!!!,This book is the most painful book I've ever had to read. Spare yourself and don't read it.
1,Annoyed,My parents bought this book last year for me as a christmas present. It was a nice idea but i am capable of be coming sucessful without the help from a book. At first glance this book turns off teens all together. It looks like the awful pants someone in their 50's would wear. The font is not eye catching and all together it reminds me of a book i would have to read in health class that told me to plan for the future and create goals . not that those are bad ideas . i myself being sixteen just didnt want to even go near this book .
4,How the book effected me,"When I was growing up I had older sisters, and one of my sisters hung out with the wrong croud ,and started to do drugs. One day she brought me to one of her friends houses and she convinced me to try smoking pot I knew it was wrong but i did casue I didnt want ot feel out of place being the yungest one and all. I was 13 at the time and her and her friends were 15-19. So when i tried it I thought it was really cool I started smoking it before school and one day I got cought. It wasnt good thats when I knew I needed to stop so i went to a counciler and I got help. It took me about 2 1/2 months to completly STOP, but I did it. and now today i am drug free and will never tough drugs agian in my life."
3,a boring book reveiw,"This so called book. The book I read was okay. The book cursed out some facts on real life. Which was cool it talked about real life problems, not problems of like rich peoples kids cursing at their teachers and their parents don't know what to do with the situation.As my teacher was saying one day when we first started to read this book. Some parents like to give this book to their teenagers as a gift. Have them read It and some times they change. Some kids don't read it. That's what my teacher said. I just read the book and answer the questions in the book.The book was okay to read I understand it. I usually don't understand any of the books I want to read. Sucks to be me! That's what I think. Well today at lunch was so fun. Me and I friends went and did stage surfing. Like at concerts. Had to write that. That's it for me on writing this essay."
2,drugs and alcohol.,"Seven habits of inflicted teensThis book is about how students act about there habits. They do drugs and alcohol.Drugs are were you doing smokes and weed. Alcohol is were you drinking. I used to do drugs, but now that I have one Nisei and one nefu and another one on the way. So I don't really have time to do those kinds of drugs and alcohol.There's nothing to do, but what until there all grow up and get married."
1,Not a Real Book,"I discovered too late that this wasn't the real thing. It is only a couple inches square. I tried to cx it, but was too late so just kept it rather than mess with the return. Had to order the real version. It's a shame they don't tell you up front the this is not just abridged, but physically nearly microscopic, relatively."
3,A little small,"Looking forward to reading this, but it is much smaller than I expected. It really is miniature, not just a small version. The title is highly recommended though."
5,A great gift for a teenager or as a training tool.,"Teenagers are so extremely busy today trying to juggle school, home life, friends, sports, after school activities, friends and plan for the future. This book helps a teen to recognize the need to look at and begin from a solid foundation in life.I work for the Office for Youth Ministry in the Archdiocese of Boston. I run many training sessions for adult youth ministers and leaders who work with teenagers. We help them create effective youth ministry environments. This book has proven an extremely effective tool in that process.It is an easy read for the teenager or for the adult that wants to read 7 Habits of Highly Effective People but want to read it from a lighter perspective. It was also used as a text for a one day training course for a group of teens at a local high school. They loved it, especially the Baby Step recommendation sections. A great gift for a teen or for those of us young at heart"
5,A great choice for begginers!,"I looked for many books for teaching myself japanese and this is the better while is not perfect. As the title implies, this book is aimed to bussiness men and the vocabulary reflect that but the lessons give you a great push to later learn more japanese suitable for your taste. The great thing about it's its structure: a main dialogue, vocabulary, key sentences and a quiz per lesson; great appendixes that let you teach general sentences structures, verbs, adjetives, and more as well as a dictionary japanese-english and english-japanese. The other drawback is that doesn't have much kanjis (numbers and days of the week) wich some may find as a plus.Overall this is a great japanese learning tool."
1,overrated,"While I am beginning to understand the rationale for how this textbook is designed, I still feel that it is too targeted to business users to be of true value to anyone not needing to do business in japan. In other words, if you are learning japanese out of personal or family interest, look elsewhere. Also as other reviewers have said it relies heavily on rote memorization which is good and/or necessary for some things (days of the week, numbers, dates, etc) but really bad for others (verb forms and conjugation)."
2,full of info you can't use,"well, i have to say i was pretty disappointed with this book. maybe i was naive to think that, as a beginner, i'd be able to learn japanese from a book. still, there's way too much information here for my brain to process. even though it's a japanese I book, it requires a basic understanding of japanese (which, sadly, i don't have). also, i ran into a lot of concepts that i wouldn't have known if i wasn't an english major. if you don't know what the words 'fricative,' or 'subjunctive' mean, don't buy this book!"
1,Not effective,"Grammatical structure in this book is not addressed properly. Asking students to memorize numerous verb conjugations is difficult and tedious. It would be far more effective to have students learn the rule for verb conjugation. That way they can apply it to any verb. This book takes this approach to most other grammatical technicalities, making it difficult for a student to learn Japanese effectively."
1,Avoid,"Only to be used if you want to learn to converse a bit in Japanese. I used this for couple weeks- and I found that ""Japanese Step by Step : An Innovative Approach to Speaking and Reading Japanese "" is a better option."
2,"The first, but not the best","I bought this dvd a few years ago. Evo gets bonus points for being the first one to put an instructional dvd out there.However, I found his particular style and interpretation of songs to be....oh....non-standard, not mainstream, whatever. It just wasn't indicative of a way I wanted to play, nor a way I commonly heard on recordings.There's better stuff out there now. Try Dirk Powell's dvd."
5,"yes, it works","ok I've used Metamucil,and Benefiber and did not care for the tastes. Even though you must take theses pills w/ a lot of water you not forced to take a lot of bad tasting water that makes you gag.(yes i could taste the 'tastless benefiber')I never really had a problem w/ my bowels until about 2 months ago when i realize i was only moving them every other day. I searched internet high and low but it wasn't until i came across an article promoting ""Acidophilus Pearls"", so i figure why just take the Acidophilus when I was also needed psylluim husk. Viola! i came across these on amazon and the vitaminshoppe site....These pills are wonderful! No cramping, no gas, and no aftertaste. I take 2 pills twice a day.. Once after waking again w/ dinner... I am back to moving my bowels twice a day. (no it's not a sudden urge to go, its more of a natural need to relieve :)..I'm in and out of the bathroom in 5-7mins...I've lost 2"" in the waist!!!!"
4,Sadly Returned,"The anklet was absolutely gorgeous but I had to send it back because it did not fit my ankle. Please don't make my mistake, measure before you order."
3,Pretty and Delicate,This ankle braclet is tiny. Would be nice for a petite young girl. If you are looking for something that will show up on your ankle this is not it. Very light and delicate.
2,Good while it lasts,"I bought a Defender at (...). It rocked for about ten minutes, then it wouldn't charge. So I got new batteries...Nothing. I exchanged it for a blue Defender, it worked for about three hours than the up button on the controller stopped working. So I exchanged it... Again. It worked for a couple of hours and stopped charging. I got new batteries again, and still, nothing. I turned out 0 for 3. If you want to go return a plane twice a day, I reccomend this, otherwise, get the Resistor for $14 more. Thats what I did, and the Resistor worked."
1,Bad Choice,"Overall the plane seems like a good idea, however the durability of the plane is very poor. We have owned two and a neighbor owned one. In all cases the planes broke within the first few flights. Very poor choice for a gift."
3,Was fun for me and my nephews,"We were able to get the plane flying and had a great time, no problems - RTFM and be sure to charge it for at least 4-minutes before the first flight. It was a blast and has lasted several hard beatings in to the pavement. Unfortunately, it isn't water proof and it stopped working after an ""accidental"" encounter with a kiddie pool."
1,The air hogs plane that did not work,This toy was a peace of garbage. I kept begging my parents to take me to fly it. So one day my dad took me and when he threw the plane and the propellers were turning it did not fly. I rather have the air hogs rocket than this toy.
4,Please read this!,This plane is fun after you figure out how to fly it. I do not think that this plane is highly durable because of the fact I broke the wing off when attempting to fly it. the plane does not last long against metal gates and fences.
2,"This thing flys, but we can't get it to steer!","This plane is pretty fun, and extremely durable, but I would never have asked for it knowing what I know now. It takes to the air like a bat: extremely fast but not very intelligent. In a nutshell, the only time that it follows the commands given to it by the remote control, it executes them about three seconds later than it was supposed to. But then again, it was less than thirty bucks, but still, I expected to be able to control it in real time. In stead of turning around in front of a neighbor's house, it this mostrosity spirals into the side of said house. I wish we could return it."
1,Horrible,"I got this plane for Christmas. After it's first flight, it got all damaged. A proppeler broke off. Very hard to turn. Very hard to land. Most of the time, it crashes. Have to recharge after 4 short flights.HORRIBLE"
2,Good while it lasts,"I bought a Defender at Wal-Mart. It rocked for about ten minutes, then it wouldn't charge. So I got new batteries...Nothing. I exchanged it for a blue Defender, it worked for about three hours than the up button on the controller stopped working. So I exchanged it... Again. It worked for a couple of hours and stopped charging. I got new batteries again, and still, nothing. I turned out 0 for 3. If you want to go return a plane twice a day, I reccomend this, otherwise, get the Resistor for $14 more. Thats what I did, and the Resistor worked."
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY.,"This airplane was a big dissappointment, It is made of styrofoam and not durable at all. I had this plane for 3 days and the body broke. The flying instructions are not very helpful."
2,its not the best,i got this toy cause i always wanted a rc plane i launch it and it did not even fly!!!! i get it working theres no wind and it looked like a ragdoll in a angry pitbulls mouth save your money get a real flyer
2,tango,Very disappointed in this CD. It sounds like it was recorded in the 30's or 40's. I say this because it sounds like the voices in very old movies.
5,Winter Reading,"Got this book for Christmas and read it twice. It is perfect winter reading -- makes you want to drink and hide away, but also feel good about it."
2,Uncool,"I read this book, and the constant namechecking made me roll my eyes until they stayed that way. We get it, Author Boy, you are quite the hipster and you know everyone worth knowing in the Seattle-Tacoma area. Ugh. When you start introducing members of the Fastbacks (who you thank in the end pages of the book) as characters in your novel, you have gone too far. List after list of band names, girlfriends, Seattle landmarks, wasn't there an editor for this thing?"
5,The New Richard Ford (if possible),"If there can be a new Richard Ford while Richard Ford is still alive, Lindquist is the guy. This book is Richard Ford with a sense of humor, pop culture sensibility, and a perfect rock music soundtrack. There's also a touch of the Bridget Jones ""Is This Really My Life"" tone, but Lindquist's hero Pete Tyler is more intelligent, and Lindquist is more literary. Never Mind Nirvana is a great summer book if you happen to be in an existential summer mood. This is commercial fiction that keeps the reader turning the pages, but done with depth and insight."
5,100 Most Eligible Bachelor Guy,"The author Mark Lindquist is one of People magazine's '100 Most Eligible Bachelor' guys and it's not hard to figure out why. Pete Tyler, the hero, apparently has a lot in common with the author and he - Pete - is the ultimate bachelor. It's kind of scary. He decides to get married when he doesn't even have a steady girlfriend and shows no ability - no ability at all - to keep one. But Pete is intelligent and introspective, and basically a good guy, very witty. So you end up liking him the same way you could like Bridget Jones even though she was nutty. I recommend this book to women for its honest and entertaining portrayal of men."
5,Makes a Nirvana fan proud,"Not only did I find this book to be one of the most if not THE most entertaining modern book I've ever written, but as a huge Nirvana fan, it's nice just to see what a fabulous author we have respresenting us and paying homage to Nirvana. Unlike High Fidelity, I found this book beyond bearable (Nothing against Hornby, I loved About a Boy)and found it both amusing and realistic. The fact that it's centered around my favorite band doesn't hurt. In fact, I ended up enjoying this book so much that I e-mailed Mark Lindquist immediately upon reading it, and I assure you, he is as nice as man as he is skillful an author. I certainly recommend this book to any lover of music or anyone else who just wants to be entertained by a clever and insightful modern novel."
4,"""Missing the Band""","Pete Tyler can't make up his mind whether he wants to grow up and get married (But to whom) or try to continue to live the adolescence life he dropped out of eight years ago when he was a member of a Seattle grunge band. Now a deputy prosecutor he likes his new life but still longs for the days when he was free to hang out at the clubs, and date all the girls he wants. Will Pete settle down and find the right girl to marry or will he continue to wander in the clubs aimlessly?A well-written story if you are into the alternative rock scene in Seattle or if you can relate or identify with these characters and their lives. There are endless quotes of different songs and alternative bands. I enjoyed this story although at the end I couldn't relate to its conclusion. The story sounds almost autobiographical. If you loved ""Nirvana"" you love this book. Enjoy."
1,A really bad book,This guy Pete is not the kind of man I would ever like to meet.He is self absorbed and exactly what all men are supposed to be-except not alot of them are
5,Almost a Seattle guide,"I really enjoyed this book. It is all about growing up - we follow the protagonist, a former local rock star who is now 38 (""almost forty"") and a prosecutor in the final stages of his process to become an adult. It is no coincidence that the story is situated in a post-grunge Seattle - the city is going through a similar grow-up process after Kurt Cobain's death. The references to the city are very accurate; you could use this book as a traveler's guide to Seattle's nightlife. Still, a very good read in the style of Jay McInnerny, Tom Wolfe or Nick Hornby."
1,POOR QUALITY,"This would be a nice bit of kit, but after only three uses the stitching came apart where the belt goes through the loop. For the price, I expected much better. If the stitching had held together, I would have given it a much better review. I haven't contacted the seller because it's just too much hassel to get things shipped to Europe. If you can get one that the stiching will hold, it is a nice bit of kit with plenty of room. I probably just got a poor one."
3,Commentary on transfer to CD,"This is an earlier version of the Barenboim Nocturnes on CD from 1990 or earlier. I got my copy around that time. I have always noticed that there is a kind of digital noise that surrounds the music, that is especially audible in quiet passages. It was especially noticeable on my first CD player which had a rather poor 16 bit DAC. Yet I can still hear some of that the noise on a good CD player. I wonder if the noise I am hearing can be attributed to a bad transfer, and if the more recent CD releases have improved upon this one. I may have to buy a newer copy and find out."
3,"Interesting, but hardly applicable outside of academia.","While it is unclear to me if this book is applicable to readers whom are not involved in academic research, the book is an interesting documentation of a cognitive researcher's thoughts about the clinical frontier of her research. As such, it provides an excellent, though rather autobiographic, insight into the mind of a brilliant researcher as well as the development of an increasingly important area of research."
1,Necklace Broke,I recieved this necklace on a Friday and by Sunday it was broke at the clasp. I only wore it once. I really liked the necklace but for it to break so easy I have second thoughts about my purchase now.
2,Not Too Thrilled,"After downloading this ebook, I immediately read a few of the ""prayers"" it contained. I put the word prayers in quotation marks because they seemed to be somewhat rambling thoughts that were centered on one's self rather than on prayers to either obtain leadership qualities or to pray for those who are in leadership positions. After scanning through the rest of the book, I was disappointed that no distinct prayers to God were offered. This book would have been better titled ""Personal Affirmations For Leadership"" rather than ""Leadership Prayers."" While I respect the enthusiasm of others who have purchased this book, I was less than thrilled. It just didn't work for me."
2,"Good performance, terrible recording","The recording quality of this performance is dismal. The choir sounds as if the mikes were covered with felt. The orchestra sound isn't as bad, but is muffled too.I have numerous choir/orchestra recordings and this one is by far the worse in terms of the reproduction quality. I would not recommend this."
5,Beautiful Music,"Poulenc has written a beautiful piece. Listening to it is a wonderful experience and calms the soul as well as the mind. The soloists is superb, and the choir is equally outstanding. A great listening experience!"
3,Broadway Salutes God!!!,"Always hard to take this music seriously, it has been long pillaged by Broadway and TV. The Gloria is really ""Broadway and TV Salute God!!"" Theme music from musicals, scifi tv, and such -- a fun time can be held picking out your favourites. The theological question of course is whether God has any problem with this kind of music: does he kick back with the soundtrack from Les Miz?The BBC version of this is also lovely."
4,VERY helpful,"This book is great. It breaks everything down into small easy to digest steps. I work alllll the time so having something to easily provide me nuggets of information is the best thing I could have. The one major problem with this book though is that I expected once I had it, I could do most of the rituals and things without much problem, but some of the things needed cost... well, alot, and aren't easy to come by. Its still enough to track them down, though with the P.O system in Alaska it may take a little more than a year and a day for me to finish this book."
5,A wonderful and enjoyable book/guide,It's clearly written and easy to follow. They outline the things you need so that you can assemble them before needing them. That helps allot. I'm really enjoying it.
3,"A good primer, but double-check his facts.","This book is almost a perfect guide for the beginner, because it provides daily exercises that introduce you to the Gods and Goddesses, the solar and lunar holidays, and general Wiccan philosophy. For someone like me who needs structure to keep them motivated, this book is really helpful. However, you should take Roderick's information with a grain of salt. I have caught a couple of factual errors in the first 50 pages, such as listing ""Dianus"" as one of the Horned God dieties. Dianus is not a real, historical god but a composite of Celtic and other European pagan gods. He first appeared in Margaret Murray's ""Witch-Cult in Western Europe"", which was poorly researched and lumped all pre-Christian European religions together. I would recommend this book as an exercise guide to teach you magical techniques, but you should do your own research if you want actual facts."
3,"Some very good information, but ...","I agree with Spooky Kitty; check Roderick's facts on some things. His views that a circle is not meant to contain spiritual or magical energy counters just about everything I've ever been taught or read. Also -- and this may be strictly a typographical error -- he shows the same direction for invoking Air and invoking Water, and the two elements are reversed on the elemental Pentagram. Air should be on the left; water on the right, according to Donald Michael Kraig's ""Modern Macgick.""And one of its huge lacks is a table of contents. The index isn't sufficiently specific to be of much use.On the other hand, I thoroughly enjoyed the suggestions for different ways to celebrate each Sabbat, and the various ways to work with the Elements and Elementals. I thought his introduction to Tarot and the Runes were very good.The book is thoughtfully done, and if it weren't for some of the errors I would give it four stars rather than three."
3,Rainbow rain gauge review from Dwayne,This rain gauge looked exactly like the picture. It measures the amount of rain that falls. What more can I say?
3,Review of Book 2 Fountain of Youth,"The title of this book is a little misleading, as it is NOT written by the same author as the original book. The original little book by Peter Kelder is THE book to read. This second book is an interpretation of the first.It is helpful, but it is also just opinions about the first book. It says that if you buy this book you don't need to buy the first book, but I disagree. The first book is fabulous, inspiring and what is more, the exercises described are REALLY powerful. They cause the body to begin a cleansing process and to realign. The exercises are all given in the second book, but it is the style, presentation and originality of the first book that makes you DO the exercises. My advice is read the first, orginal book BEFORE you read the second one. The second one is not even necessary, but it does help on questions about diet etc. Vague sense of a publisher making more money here."
4,"A good supplement to Book 1, but not absolutely necessary to everybody.","This book was written fairly recently and it is exactly what is says: a companion to book 1. It has today's perspetive of specialists on the rites and teaching of Colonel Bradford, but it is not necessary. But if you have serious difficulty executing certain of the rites in Book 1, this one will give you some easier alternatives -which of course were not in the original teachings- but might be beneficial as well. Since I am performing the original rites I have no reason to replace them with any other exercises. But overall, this is also a good book and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it and learning some more info on nutrition."
1,If you want a laugh...,"If you want a few chuckles about how gullible people were in olden times (pre-2000) - get this book!It's about how this mysterious Colonel went to this mysterious place back in some mysterious time when there were lots of mysterious monks & stuff around, and he became a younger man by doing some yoga-type exercises and by channeling his sexual energy into ""something important"".!!!! (Such as....???)Everyone involved with this sham should take a cold, hard look at themselves."
1,Unsubstantial,"Wow and to think that those 10 billion people who lived throughout history could have extended their lives by doing the most primitive stretching exercises and breathing in a controlled manner, AMAZING. To bad Buddha, the founder of buddhism, never discoverd these secrets. He would have been shocked."
1,not worth buying,You may think you will get this book to get more information about the Five Rites. Instead you get a collection of articles by various people essentially unrelated except that they are mostly health related. This book is just some publishers idea of a way to make more money on the Five Rites name. The volume one book is all you need. It has it all!RLC
5,great shoes,was bought for my daughter! she wore them under she prom dress. She has many pairs of converse shoes! She loves them!
4,COLOR NOT CORRECT,Color was a lighter shade of pink on screen than when I received them. I like the pale pink better.
2,disorganized. difficult for the newcomer to matisse,"Ms. Spurling has done a lot of research, and clearly knows a lot about Matisse. But for a newcomer to Matisse, her presentation is confusing and frustrating. The organization of her materials is very poor, her writing is a breathless, hyperactive stlye that is difficult to endure. I learned a lot about Matisse, but I didn't enjoy it, and I'm confused about much that I read. Overall, I'm disappointed."
3,Length is not necessarily Depth,"The narrative quality, even of a historical biography, is what keeps us reading. Only so many details can be digested before the reader bloats and stalls out in his efforts to follow the story the writer is trying to tell us. Ms. Spurling, from her style, apparently comes from an academic background, for this book is written seemingly in the fear some expert will come along and point out an omitted detail. To her credit, I found none. But neither did I find a tremendous critical faculty for weeding out the mundane from the significant. I am generally opposed to abridgements, but the tedium in this book would greatly benefit from that process. Much as I love Matisse, I am not that interested in what he had for breakfast."
5,A fun book to read in the bathtub.,"I liked this book because it was full of interesting facts about Lucy's life. I didn't know that much about her before I read the book, but when I did, I liked her a whole lot because she seemed like a real person."
5,Thank You!,"Thank you for such an insightful and very factual book. I don't want to hear what the ""professionals"" say. You know, the ones that make millions if not billions of dollars every year from telling you ""It's fine and you need not worry about the chemicals we put into your child"". I applaud you!"
5,IF YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A BABY,"Read this book. it is filled with legitimate studies, by doctors, scientists, the government, etc, that build a strong case for the ""scariness"" of vaccines."
1,pass on this one,"This is an index to the book that SHOULD have been written. This is a good overview, but does not provide examples, walk-throughs or details."
5,A Rare Glimpse From the Mets Golden Era,"This CD brought back wonderful memories of great performances with the stellar voices from the Met's golden era. People will buy this CD for names like Bernstein and Horne, but it is the ensemble cast that makes this recording so rare and special. Thomas Mowrey's review said the great Mezzo-soprano Marcia Baldwin had died, but I am happy to report that a friend of mine's daughter is receiving voice lessons from the very talented and alive Ms. Baldwin in the Pacific Northwest. By the way, it is voices like Ms. Baldwin (who had twelve glorious seasons at the Met) - so rarely captured on recordings - that make this CD worth owning. It will transport you to a golden time in American Opera."
4,Beautiful doll - not very durable!,"My daughter received this doll for her 5th birthday. She was so excited because she has always wanted a Mermaid Barbie but I could never find one. This year with the Mermaidia movie released, her and I were both thrilled to see Mermaid barbies on the store shelves! She loves the movie too. She loves playing with this doll, especially in the bathtub where you can change her haircolor and ""bodyart"". The hair changes color easily but the body art takes a while to get it to full and bright color.My only complaint about this doll is the tail. My daughter had this doll all of one day before the fin snapped off the tail. It was the end of the world for my daughter. The fin part of the tail is very poorly made! I ended up buying a new one for my daugther and she was been so very careful with that tail. So far it's lasted almost 2 weeks."
4,tail snaps off easily,"while it is an attractive and unique design, my almost five year old was able to snap the tail off easily--two days after purchase!"
1,Does NOT support Windows 2000 or XP Pro,"Picked this up at [a local store], and to my horror, it does not support win 2k or XP pro. It DOES say this on the side of the box, so it's not a total rip off, but still - they say 'for windows' everywhere and only in the small type do they point this out. They DO support XP home; just not XP pro, or win 2k pro.I don't know how to get around this; the more advanced versions of the software support the 'pro' editions!"
3,Not very good with protection glasses,"The mask itself is very good quality, but there is small space between mask and skin from both sides of nose. When you breath the air comes through that space directly to eyes and fogs glasses. If you play airsoft then you have to wear protection glasses.If you use this mask without such glasses then it is just perfect. Also you can put it on from another side in which case it will be completely black.Another important issue for me was that they sent ACU digital masks, while this page shows Woodland Digital. So it was not very useful for me."
5,Fantastic!,"Just what I was looking for! Thanks a ton, not to mention it was very cheap for a great make! Thanks again!"
1,Would not play on my bluray/DVD - no refund,"Non-US format! I bought this just prior to a business trip. Tried it when I returned and it would not play on either bluray or DVD. Reread the Amazon listing, and the BluRay jacket for this series and could not find any reference to a format that is not standard. I contacted the provider just ""after"" the return expiration date, explained the situation. No refund. Why Amazon would allow non-standard items to be sold via their U.S. store is beyond me and I am NOT amused. P.S. for the record I loved Strike Back Project Dawn on Cinamax."
1,"Im not giving the show 1 star, but the product 1 star.",Here is the reason why! The reason is that it does not state in the features that this won't play in AMERICA!!!!!!.
1,Not all region and unwatchable on US player,"Very disappointed that what was advertised as all region is clearly not--probably playable in the UK. Don't buy this item. Terrific show, though."
1,Would not play on USA region 1 blu-ray player & slow refund,Don't buy this dvd and expect it to play on USA-AMERICAN blu-ray players made for region 1. This dvd box set was advertised to play on any region blu-ray players. I tried 3 players and the players would not even recognize there was a disc in the machine. I even called Amazon to report the problem and recommended that the dvd information should state that it will not play on USA region 1 players to avoid the lost time and returns. I also asked if Amazon could find this dvd set made for USA region 1 so I could buy it. I don't feel I got much help from Amazon.
1,Seems to be Region 2,I have tried a few different Blu-ray players and it will not play on any of them. I even went so far as to try purchase another blu-ray player and It still will not work. I have to assume it is region 2 specific. Blu-ray players in the US are region 1.I am in the process of trying to get a region 1 copy or a refund from the seller now.
1,will not play,"Will not play on my brand new Sony Blu ray player. Don't know about content. It was great when I watched it on Cinemax last year, but cannot play in on my player. I'm guessing it has incompatible region code."
1,Harmon Kardon CDR 26,Right side laser (record side) skips frequently during recording and playback. This problem occurred about 1 year after purchase ($400). Still skipped after cleaning laser. I am very disappointed with this unit and would not recommend it.
2,Bad deal,"I purchased this model new in 2005 and used it rarely. One year after I bought it,the left tray began sticking. A little prying would free it up but the instances became more frequent. Two years after I bought it, the right tray began sticking.Eventually both trays were stuck and no amount of prying would open them. I removed the cover to locate the jam and found that the mechanisms that drive the trays in and out had ceased to function. This is pretty poor coming from a company that is supposedly top of the line. I contacted Harman Kardon and was given the option to send it out for repairs. I sent it alright, out to the garbage can and ordered a Tascam.Very disappointed. My advise: don't waste your money on this one."
1,Dont buy it!,"I warn you. If you get addicted easily do not buy this game. I played for over a year and I was never happy with the game but I kept playing? Why you ask? well you work so hard to get better, but once you get better you feel like you've accomplished nothing, so you keep working hard to get better but you keep getting no where. This game is terribly addicting, you'll find yourself playing for hours and hours every day. You'll probly get on right when you get off of work and wont get off unless you absolutely have to, its that bad. I've heard of people killing themselves because they somehow lose all their equipment. They even have addiction groups to join (think AA but for EQ) to try and stop playing. How sad is that? I knew this game was consuming my life so I deleted my Characters, my account and I havent ever played since. Save yourself the trouble, enjor your life (your own, not your characters) and dont get this game."
1,I don't think you should play everquest,"Some people are worried that the computer game EverQuest is more than a hobby. Instead, it's being described as an addiction. One counsellor has even nicknamed the game ""EverCrack.""There are more than 400,000 EverQuest players in North America, and twenty-five to thirty hours a week of playing appears common. A recent study of 2,000 EverQuest players shows 45 percent of them admit to being addicted.In Hudson, Wisconsin, Liz Woolley has already seen the down side of EverQuest. She says her 21-year-old son Shawn became addicted to the game. He was diagnosed with depression and eventually killed himself with EverQuest still flickering on his screen. Woolley says the maker of EverQuest, Sony On-Line, has made a game so powerful, it's addictive, and she wants Sony to put warning labels on the game.To learn more about this story, tune in to Marketplace Tuesday, October 15th at 8:30 pm (9:00 Nfld. and Labrador) on CBC'smain network."
2,"Oh gosh, were back to gay stuff.","This game is really annoying and can remind you of not the cool fantasy with adventure, but the little pink fairy magic that you see in the forest. Gosh, why do people like this game so much?Im not even giving a review, because If you get it, youll cancel the subscription the next month like I did. Look at screenshots and itll tell you.The pictures lie, its a trick, dont listen to them! If you want adventure like that, youll have to be playing till your an old man. Get Final fantasy XI, or Dark age of camelot or something."
1,cant play it,"if you buy this game used be sur eyou find out if the CD key can be used. When I tried to play the game it told me the cd key was in use, no other options available. watch out."
2,"Good Concept, Bad Delivery","I Have played Everquest since a few months after release. In the beginning it was fun, it was a new world to explore. After 40 levels or so you finally learn that is just turns into either a constant hassle looking for xp or You end up fighting with someone over the Rare loot in the game. Then you decide to turn to Trade skills. Another nice concept if you have alot of spare cash sitting around and don't want to ever make a profit from it unless you are of a few special classes Shaman and Enchanter come to mind. If you ever want to be able to do anything fun in this game get used to getting almost no sleep and having no life.The first 20 levels are fun but after that it becomes a job that you pay to work at =)"
4,This is really a good Game,"I have always had fun in Everquest. With the PC quests and meeting thousands of people every week it is just amazing. I have never really had a dull time. As you level up your horizon broadens as well. You can go to more challenging areas and take on new NPC quests. Sure there are some bad things like the unchanging NPC quests and hostile in town NPCs, but really it is quite fun. The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is that it is pay to play."
2,No!,"yes this game can be fun, but it is VERY addictive, i am a player of a year and a half, and am finally quitting. As far as the actual game goes, it seems very high-level focused, making it hard to start out. As well, combat can seem very redundant after a while."
1,An unjust God allowed Everquest to be...,"I bought Everquest under the delusion that I would be connected to a wonderful world. Well it was real looking and some of the people were really nice, but...THERE IS NOTHING TO DO. You spend all of your time running around killing bats, and pumas. If you even manage to get to level 13, you have to wait till level 25 to do a quest. Anyone who knows anything will tell you that takes a long time. I have a pretty good attention span but even I can't take just killing creatures for months. I needed a plot or a goal. I wanted quests for God's sake, quests. Anyway, I do not recomend this game. May God have mercy on those who are stuck with this game."
5,The Best Of The Best,"This game is the best. The Graphics are mind blowing and the play is great. Ever Quest is one of the most succesful Role Playing games ever. The new expansions are great. The trilogy has all of the expansions. When you play, you are in a whole different world. This game is very addicting."
2,There are other MMORPGs out there... (...),"I have been playing these types of games for about two years now. It started with Everquest. Everquest was slow moving, boring but soooooooo addictive....Now I'm playing Lineage. It takes everything Everquest did makes it 100x better and also throws in some great new ideas. Lineage has this thing called bloodpledges which are groups of warriors led by a prince or princess. These bloodpledges are always trying to capture castles that other bloodpledges control and its a great thing to do after you get to a high level unlike in Everquest when you stand around waiting for teh next expansion pack when you get to a high enough level.Speaking of expansion packs Lineage releases a new episode every month(its now on epiode 9) and a new continent 4 times a year. It's like getting 4 free expansion packs a year!!! And trust me these continents are HUGE! (...)"
4,What happened ???,"Yosh!! Although I did not read the book until after seening the show, I was impressed with the writing. This is amoung the best novelizations I have ever read, I could actually envision the story all over again. Unfortunately I realised that there was a part missing [at least 3 episodes]. This is where my gripe lies, as I was unable to see the last episode in its entirety. I was depending on the book to fill in all the blanks but alas that was not to be. Hopefully there will be a continuation,(hint hint) and I will actually find out happened."
5,I thought the book was great.,The book was great. But the only thing wrong was that I couldn'y read the wholeseries. They should publish all the books before they put one on the market.
5,A little mind candy...,A little mind candy. With little time for recreational reading it is often fustrating to find something worthy of that precious time. If you like a great sci-fi adventure pick this book up. Yo will not put it down!
2,An overpriced article,"I was interested in this topic after seeing the author on C-Span. I purchased the book and finished it in about 45 minutes. It really is a long article disguised as a book. Big type, small booklet format, etc. If it had been printed as a book, I doubt it would exeed 50 pages. I somehow fely short-changed.The writing was OK, but styled more like a newspaper article.I suggest you save the money and try to catch the author again on C-Span"
2,God help them,"Listening to this recording from the great Karajan was a large deception. The constant screaming from the chorus was so unbearable that I can not figure that there is people who can appreciate it. For those in search for a best interpreatation, I recommend the one with Philippe Herreweghe or John Eliot Gardiner."
4,Given recent events in Korea this is must reading!,"The author has been there more than once! You only have to read about recent events in the two Koreas to realize how topical this book is. As the plot unfolds you begin to think that it is something out of the morning papers.Then there is the love story ""angle"" - the 3 star and the 0-3. It makes you wonder if one or both may get court martialed, but maybe it is just a spin-off from the Monica-Bill story. And, has the author touched a military ""nerve""?Great reading. Keep the book handy - the next ""chapter"" might be reported on national news"
2,first major disappointment from Benchmark,"We've had excellent luck with benchmark maps in the past, especially Idaho, Oregon, and (for the most part) Washington. The ability to zoom in at 3 different levels of detail on a particular area is a major bonus. The landscape level detail typically far exceeds the Gazeteer maps. California is really out of date, however, and caused miles and miles and hours of wasted time. In particular we were traveling in Northern California, and time after time, the map failed to indicate that roads no longer were open to the public due to privatization, development, gated resort compounds, logging, etc. Mileage accuracy was also poor for the region near Mount Shasta. We traveled miles down dirt roads to find locked gates and campgrounds that no longer existed. Benchmark sorely needs an update to California. We won't give up on the company yet, but this book was truly disappointing."
4,About as good as you can do on paper,"I bought this for a recent driving trip through California. I have a GPS, but it does a lousy job of giving a ""big picture"" view of things, while the Benchmark guide is much more useful. On the other hand, it doesn't really have enough detail for street-level navigation of major cities, but it's hard to fit street-level maps for all of California into a book that mere mortals can actually lift."
3,Benchmark California Road & Recreation Atlas,"Works fine to locate recreation areas. As a road map it is difficult to distinguish the roadways on the color background or when they overlap other features, i.e. property boundry, streams, etc.."
4,Shows little known trails in Mountains,Has everything including the 'off-road' trails in the mountains. Did you know there are off-road trails in Orange County? I didn't know until I got this atlas.Many of these fire roads are open to the public.
4,"Very good road atlas, but not the 5th edition","Great altas for navigating backroads or planning trips. Would have rated it 5 stars, but received the 4th edition instead of the 5th as advertised."
4,Good for off highway adventures,"Just got into dirt biking around SoCal, and this atlas has good detail for forest service roads, jeep trails, railroad and utility rights of way, etc. A bit large to carry on the bike, but worth th effort."
4,Mystery worth reading,I am an avid mystery reader and enjoyed this new collaboration between Don Sipes and Earl Hamner Jr. I am also a Walton fan and this book is definitely not written in the same mode. The only problem I had with the book is that I wan't more!!! It was too short!
2,Perfect lecture...,".. but nothing more! It's a superb reading of the Sonata, but no soul, no feelings! Nuages gris is absolutely flat, less than a exercise for tremolandos!Surprising, because Pollini's Chopin is marvellous, full of passion and feeling! But here, is hard to feel Liszt's poetry and tragic dilemma in Mr. Pollini playing!Better playing - Sonata: Yundi Li (DG), Dubravka Tomsic (IPO); Nuages Gris: Hamelin (Hyperion)."
3,"Works, but not as good as I expected","This item had very high reviews, but I didn't realize that they were almost all for the 25-foot version and none of them were for the 50-foot longtape. The two are totally different. The 50 foot one doesn't retract itself (there is a crank), and is flimsier and much thinner. I can live with this though.The most absolutely brain-dead part about this product is that the first marking is the 2-inch mark, which comes 1 inch after the beginning of the tape. So if you line up the head of the tape with something, then the 2-inch mark is actually 1 inch away, the 1-foot mark is actually 11 inches away, etc. Totally stupid. Graphically, instead of:|-1-2-3-...it's instead:|-2-3-4-...where each - is 1 inch of space."
4,Very Durable,"Very Durable, since I seem to drop everything. I do have a bit of trouble reeling in, but i could just be doing something wrong."
3,Okay,"I ordered this product to use in our commercial space but, didn't meet our expectations. Good product but not for me - thanks"
5,Amazing book for children of all ages,This is a must-have book to add to your holiday shopping for children of any age. My 6 year old and 3 year old boys have an extreme love for all sort of dogs and instantly fell in love with Henley. We hope Henley and the author will make more journeys together.
5,excellent,i love this book!! Excellent! beautiful colors and designs. i want to recommend this book to all Japanese chin owners. thank you very much Henley
3,it's just a calculator after all,"The merchant ships quickly and usually has great products- it could be that I received a bad unit but I have to almost jab the numbers to get a response. Not what I expected- if the key response was better, this could have easily rated a five (it's just a calculator after all)."
1,Completely UNSECURE and flimsy,"This metal box is so flimsy that you can lock it then just press on the side of the box, popping it open. It's completely UNSECURE and useless for locking anything up. I now use it as just a plain metal box. Check out the Sentry fire safes -- much better."
2,Lock Box Review,"The box is sturdy, but the same cannot be said about the lock. Sometimes it is hard to open, using the slide release, even when unlocked."
1,Disappointed,"The item is titled a ""LOCKING"" steel file box from Honewell (one of the supposed leading companies in security). The lock on the file box didn't work. While in the locked position, you could easily pull open the top of the file box.SO MUCH FOR SECURITY!"
1,Very Flimsy,"This box is cheaply made, has a lock that you can unlock with a paper clip and the metal is thinner than a baking pan. It does hold hanging files, somewhat. If all you want is a box to put papers in so that you can run out of the house with them during an emergency, get a cheaper plastic one. This one will not keep anyone out of the papers you keep inside, it is not even remotely fire or water resistant(the plastic ones are more water resistant), and dents if it gets knocked over. If I could ever get Amazon to acknowledge I sent an item back, I would return this (I only order from Amazon if I can afford to lose the money-I like the merchandise, but the return portion stinks.)"
2,Dented in shipping,"Very thin/lightweight steel. Was a great price - but as w/everything, you get what you pay for. This product ended up dented in shipping, and has to be muscled closed. Since I won't be accessing it often, I will put up w/that, but I not too impressed. I'm also still working on getting the locking mechanism to work properly."
3,Bed box,I am a disabled person confined to bed. I do all my paperwork while in bed. These boxes allow me to remain productive from bed. The nicest thing about the box is the narrow dimension which allows me to have the box in bed and being able to sleep with it because it is so narrow.
3,royal fun,"Prince Arthur may not have noticed Dana Larson when he visited the middle school in Sweet Valley Twins,and nobody did really..but when the prince comes to Sweet Valley,he falls for the blond lead-singer of a rockband with a boring name-The Droids.But Arthy is in a tough situation ...he actually came to the humble little valley ..all the way from across the world in a tiny country called Santa Dora...to find his bride.Elizabeth Wakefield had been a contender.Now,if Dana finds out,will she know that Arthurs feelings ARE genuine."
3,"Sound okay, a few good pieces","I differ with the first two commenters in one respect. I thought the sound was okay, but not fabulous. The first piece on the album sounded especially artificial. I have a pretty good sound system and things were a little too concise and smooth. The percussion was empty (I have a sensitive subwoofer), and the violins did sound electronic. As to the quality of the music, there was a certain sameness to it, but then that's true of most composers. I thought the music sounded like Ron Nelson's (he's an eminent band composer). The music is mostly cheery and airy. In terms of quality, I thought the last piece on the album was excellent, and I will listen to the album again. I doubt it will become a favorite -- there is too much better modern music being composed, especially by the movie scorers (Zimmer, Horner, Korzeniowski to name but a few)."
2,"Sound good, music mediocre","Yes, the sound is great in stereo, and very involving and sharp (its a virtual orchestra) on surround, and one or two tracks are quite interesting. Unfortunately, with the exception of the title track, the rest are of the music is fairly derivitave and ""samey"". So, of you want to show off SACD, then get it, but if you want a rewarding musical experience, look elsewhere."
1,Paper (that belongs in the bin) House,"From the director, Bernard Rose, I was expecting another great film after seeing the magnificent achievement of Candyman. By god was I wrong. This film is, without a doubt, the biggest dissapointment I had ever come across and possibly one of the worst films I had ever seen. With a rediculous plot and, oh my god, the acting was absolutely dreadful I almost turned it off half way through. But I couldnt judge something I havent seen fully. I have noticed some may think that this is one of those films that is not for the fans of violence and gore which is absolutely right. But neither is this for fans of the psychological themes with no violence. I agree completely that horror needs no violence whatsoever to be a success. Take the Blair Witch for instance. But not even violence could save this garbage. If your looking for the successful psychological horror out there, check out Session 9."
4,A beautiful and haunting film.,"I do not like horror, but I love this movie! It is scary, true, but it earns its scares honestly, by exploring in-depth the inner life of a troubled young girl. The day she turns 11, Anna falls ill and, while unconscious, enters a drawing she has made. As she changes the drawing, the dream world also changes - what's more, it seems to affect her waking life. The young girl playing Anna gives a fine performance, and the film is visually very beautiful. It captures perfectly an atmosphere of dream sliding into nightmare - and is also notably honest about the complexities of early adolescence. It respects the imagination and courage of children. Different - but, if you like it, you'll want to see it more than once."
3,Requiem,"This is a digitally remastered (ADD) recording which comes out of the process very well with a good dynamic range. The performances are good, with the all-Germanic performers blending together well. The atmospheric slow choir parts are particularly enjoyable."
1,very disappointed,"The ""star quality"" of the performers lead me to believe this would be a good purchase. However, it took less than 2 minutes for me to realize I had too much confidence in von Karajan & Co. The balance between the orchestra and chorus is not good, and when you can hear the chorus, it sounds as if they're standing in the middle of a gymnasium. I did try to ""give it a chance"" and listen all the way through... but after sampling several tracks and being in pain each time, I had to stop. I don't doubt the other reviewers who enjoyed this recording, I simply have different expectations for a performance of this piece. I have heard several, and though the purists may chuckle at my recommended conductor, I recommend Deutsche Grammophon - Leonard Bernstein with Symphonie-Orchester des Bayerischen Rundfunks. Just my 2 cents."
4,Just the right size,This wil hold must have data to carry in an emergency.My fireproof secure safe is too heavy. This is just right.
3,Good storage - minimal security and protection,"This locking box is good for storing things, and for keeping small hands away from things, etc. But please don't purchase this box thinking that it will be a highly secure solution, nor thinking that it will protect the contents from fire or water - it won't. It is a great way to organize papers or small items that need more attention than storing in a drawer, but unless you place this box inside another safe, it will not protect well.The box could be easily pryed open (as noted by one customer who experienced a broken lock, and had to do so to get into the box). There is no water-tight seal, nor is there any fire resistance to speak of. If you're trying to put a few things away ""so the kids don't mess with them"", this will work. If you need more peace of mind you should consider a more expensive solution."
4,Pretty Good Safe,"The only reason I'm even giving it 4 stars is because my safe came with a tiny dent on the top and a dust impression of a shoe..Other than those 2 minor cons, the safe does it's job. I already filled it up with a few items and the weight is pretty nice when your items are in it.It's pretty sturdy and well built. Though I know if I drop it, my contents inside would get damaged somewhat. I'm pretty sure anybodycan open it somehow with a hammer or a power tool. But for minor security, this gets the job done.I have it on top of my larger safe,(SentrySafe H3300) I just bought this one for smaller things things I use more oftensince it's a transportable safe. And before I got to bed, I put it right in the larger safe, Lol. Fits like a beaut."
4,concerned father,I bought this for my daughter who was keeping her important documents in a envelope. I've had one for years and like the fact that it is fireproof and has sturdy construction with a decent lock.
3,not fire or water proof!!!!!,when i got it i wented to test how safe it was it had a steel layer then afire proof istalautor than another steel layer so first i put it with some useless documents of mine in water it imediatly the whole thing got soaked then i let it dry up and put it under 2000 degree thermite at in 5 seconds it was almost ash............I recomend this for protecting this from ur little kids or burguralys dont rely on it incase there is a flood or fire! but any its strong and durable.
3,Not the best product,Other similarly-priced safes that are more fireproof and more secure are available. The top lid is single layer and the lock is not exactly confidence-inspiring.
4,Works good,"Works good for the price. I bought this item to be able to keep some ofmy items away from kids and nosy adults.This security box shouldn't be a container for money, weapon, or any important documentbecause if you want to you can break into this box."
3,nothing special,easy to break open much better off buying something more secureother then that product is okay for the price
4,It works.,4 stars because it works as a stationary safe to keep nosey people out of. I don't expect this item to prevent theifs from breaking into it though.I didn't give 5 stars because when using the handle to transport the device the items inside bang up on the under lid where there is no foam protection making a lot of noise. I don't mind the items moving around insecurely but I don't need them making noise every time I transport the box from point A to point B.All in all it keeps nosey people out of my belongings. Thanks!
1,do not buy,"I will not buy a lock box from this company again. Within two days the lock jammed, the key would not open it, and I had to pry it open with a butter knife. Yes that's how cheap this product was! Save your money!"
3,December#10,Pippi longstocking was one of the first chapter books I read as I had to read it for a Third grade class. I enjoyed the way she gets herself out of jams and helps show the neighbor kids a whole new way of life that they've never seen before. There is one thing that is stuck in my mind from that book and it is how everything is upside down in her house. I think that this should be every kids first chapter book because it is easy to read and it helps kids open their imagination. It showed me how to use mine and even though I didn't do the stuff Pippi did it still helped me open up my imagination and I hope it still helps kids.
2,dissenting view on Pippi,"Even as a kid, I remember getting bored with Pippi quickly. Unless I'm not recalling correctly, each chapter stands alone, so there's no real plot as such. The other thing that bothered me was that the author bothered to create a defiant, irreverant, spunky girl hero, yet her two friends are stereotypically male and female, to the extent that they don't even have personalities--they're just cardboard cutouts, foils for the main character. Not only is Annika fearful, hesitant, afraid of risking adult disapproval, and not wanting to get her dress dirty, but she's not in the least influenced by Pippi to be more adventurous. Lindgren sold lots of books but to my mind didn't accomplish much. Unlike Caddie Woodlawn, this protagonist is too far out in left field to truly inspire girls."
2,Pipi Longstocking,Pipi LongstockingPippi Longstocking by Astrid Lindgren is an inspiring tale about a girl named Pipi. She has a horse and a monkey named Mr. Nelson. Next door are two very polite children named Tommy and Annika and they become friends. I like that I can relate to Annika in that she is always hesitant but after she gets started she doesn't want to stop Pipi's fother is a sea man and left her at the house with a suitcase full of gold pieces. Pipi likes to go on adventures. One was when Pipi tricked two thieves into leaving her house with nothing This is just one example of the many heroic adventures in this exciting book. I like that it has a moral that is deep so you have fun reading it and you close the book with a smile.
5,Pippi!,"Pippi Longstocking is the best series of books ever. Astrid Lindgren wrote these books so colorfully and beautifully, every child has to love them.Pippi was originally translated from Swedish, and, if you speak it, I would recommend getting the Swedish version."
4,"An oldie, but a goodie!","I remember reading this book when I was in grade school. It's pretty silly, but fun!"
4,Pippi Longstocking,My opinion of this book Pippi Longstocking. I thought that the story was very good. I really recommend this book to other people because it is funny and interesting. Pippi is a thing-finder and likes to tell stories. She is always making up stories that make you wonder if they are really true. She keeps you interested because you don't know what she will do next. I hope that you will read this really good book.
2,5th Symphony a disappointment,"I've been a long time lover of Bernstein's early New York Philharmonic recording of this symphony, and downloaded this later recording with the Vienna Philharmonic out of curiosity. I regret having done so. Mind you, the recorded DGG sound is gorgeous, as is the playing of the VPO, as one expects it to be. But there is such a sense of boredom and malaise that permeates this performance (I only heard the 5th symphony, and not the 7th) that one cannot help but wonder if LB was not in the best of health when he recorded it. All of the magic, wonder and grandeur of this piece, captured so beautifully in the earlier New York Phil recording (and by other conductors such as Rattle, Berglund, etc.), is lost in this version. The Maestro, who had given the world so many electrifying performances, was just not having a good day in the recording studio."
2,A breeze to read,"Perhaps my opinion of this book is affected because I read it immediately after reading Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series, but this book was kind of a joke! I guess I am used to heavy details, realism, lushly written and complex characters. The author seemed so monotone and the language was just so skeletal. It seemed like a blow by blow account with not much feeling. I really didn't ""worry"" about the characters that much and the villain - well, he just seemed villainous because - he felt like it??? It would have been much more intriguing if the mother was behind it and sent David out to kill James or something (seeing as how odd her behavior was at James and Ellen's relationship). That said, the love story was very sweet and this book was a breeze to read. Fun and light."
3,has a few flaws,"Stereo rocks very well, has plenty of power. Plays all sorts of discs well. Some things annoy me though.1st) won't switch from clock to text display when playing MP3 discs, only does track# to clock.2nd) volume knob needs to be knurled or stick out more, hard to grip while driving3rd) joystick control is hard to use, very small if you have big fingers, and really hard to control while driving if you hit even the smallest road imperfection.4th) blue dot matrix display doesn't really match the rest of the unit, and display fades out completely if sunlight shines on it."
3,Just So-so for my needs,"This is a great resource if you're travelling in Europe, the United States and most anywhere in the Western World, but it is woefully inadequate in its treatment of Latin America. I mean, come on, no listings for Venezuela? And the most popular sauna in San Jose is missing completely. If you're cruising for Latin meat south of the border, look for your information elsewhere."
4,excellent,"This book is especially good for those looking to improve their knowledge of how fabric hangs on the body, and/or if one wants to understand how traditional miko outfits actually work. Not just for maid outfits, but for any girl character who may wear a frilly dress, it is very helpful.. with views from all directions...and detailed information on areas that may be the most difficult, such as ruffles, sleeves, back views, etc. It's not for beginners, but it's a great addition to any ""How To Draw Manga"" collection. I loved it!"
2,so-so,"About the maids: It is nothing fun like the cover makes it seem. I expected to learn how to draw frills and different ways to draw maid outfits. Instead, they showed a select few of boring, traditional outfits.About the miko: It was pretty good. Not much was expected from this.Both: Every couple of examples held a broom, but that's it.They showed the same picture (mostly a girl with one arm on her side and one in the air)in different angles. It wasn't very helpful. What WAS helpful was that they showed girls laying down and most books don't show you that.This is a book if you want to learn how to draw dull (realistic and not very manga-like), but traditional maids. Miko's are okay in this book."
5,Great Rock n' Roll Live,"I love this video of the greats of the 60's performing today. It's wonderful to see the music live on, and that the greatest artists of those days are still out there performing and sounding just as wonderful today. Would highly recommend it to anyone who loves the music from that time period, you will enjoy watching it again and again!"
3,Undetermined,"Have not yet used this drill but thought I would mention that the vehicle charger is the only charger. I had thought the vehicle charger was an extra charger since as advertized ""with vehicle charger"" would suggest that as extra. Have ordered home charger/ trickle charger so will update my review after I use the drill."
5,"Mozart: Flute Concerto, K313; Andante for Flute & Orchestra","This is the quintessential recording of the Mozart Orchestral Flute Repertoire. Ms. Palma has been a member of the renowned Orpheus Chamber Orchestra since 1980 and is one of the leading flutists in the World. Her incomparable tone, phrasing and understanding of these pieces, coupled with the usual Orpheus magic make this THE version of these pieces to own. Ms. Palma's tone is her calling card, enabling her to convey the beauty of the pieces with the coolness and ease of a jazz artist. She avoids the tight, perfunctory ""perfect"" reading most flutists project and the cadenzas (which she composed herself) are marvelous. A beautiful recording by Deutsche Grammaphon"
2,Try this instead...,"I have four versions of the flute and harp concerto by Mozart, including this one,but the one version I find to be superior is the Hickox rendition on Hyperion, which Amazon offers. The warmth of the playing, the perfect tone of the sound, and the obvious care in production on that cd highlights the indifference of the playing on this one."
2,Not so great.,"Having taken Pilates classed at my local gym, this DVD is way too basic and too short. Don't waste your money."
2,Focus is on medical treatments,"This is the first review i've written and I just wanted to let people know that this in essence is a good book....but only if your looking for drugs/medications as a priority to dealing with your hormonal problems. I ordered this book along with another book called ""hormonal balance"" and there's no comparing between the two. The other book talks indepth about exactly what your hormones do...and how they control your body. This book gives a short explanation followed by prescriptions that your doctor might advise...it has alternative treatments...but they are not very detailed...and focus more on ""get more sleep....exercise....etc"". All in all it's not a bad book...but there are definetly better one's out there."
4,What everyone needs to know,"This book is informative and easy to follow. It's broken down into understandable chapters, making it easy to find the section you're interested in."
5,Nothing better out there for character building,"This is simply the best!! I also own the similiar book for girls called Polished Cornerstones. Doorposts is the company who creates these products and I love the unique books and items they have. I bought this book for my sister for her two sons aged 7 and 15. Believe it or not, this book really works for both ages. Suberb book - a must have."
5,very good jazz singer,Laura fyfi one of the best jazz singers around to the best of my knowledge she has never had any live shows in the US. She has two DVD shows for sale if you like her voice you should look into her DVDs.
2,Chet Day has since Renounced some of this Material,"Chet Day no longer works for Hallelujah Acres and now maintains a web-site addressing some of the elements of the Hallelujah Diet that are dangerous and people need to know about.You should do some research on this and all other Hallelujah Acres materials before you accept it at face value especially for pregnant women, nursing mothers and children and adolescents.Reader Beware!"
4,Twenty-One Days to Health,I was surprised at how fast the book arrived. It was in excellent condition. Good service
4,"Siezed: Temporal Lobe Epilepsy as a Medical, Historical, an","The promise of this title is well kept. The title proposes to examine the medical phenomenon of Temporal Lobe Epilpsey (TLE) from a historical and artistic perspective. The author at no time pretends medical expertise. She does, however, present this disease in its varing severity from the viewpoint of a literary person. It has become common in even recognized sientific journals to speculate on diseases which have afflicted well-known historical persons. Eve LaPlante is proposing that some famous people were aflicted with TLE and that this disease was intimately involved in their productive life.Eve LaPlante's thesis is eloquently presented. The book reads well and is a valuable addition to the expositions on the subject.I found the book a worthwhile read."
5,"Finally, it all makes sense!","I have temporal lobe epilepsy, and this book explained so much for me! I was initially diagnosed following a head injury at 18, but I had a bit of memory loss, so I don't remember how much I was told about it. In college, I stopped taking anti-seizure meds because I never had tonic-clonic seizures and assumed the diagnosis had been incorrect. When the seizures I did have worsened and I finally discovered I had TLE, Ms. LaPlante's book helped me to understand so much. I've experienced things I never previously associated with epilepsy. (I found the book recommended on the website of the Epilepsy Foundation.)"
4,siezed by seized,As someone who suffers this affliction I found the book interesting and at the same time full of passages that made me sad because it fit some of my issues so well. TLE is so strange and vague in its symptoms that it can be difficult to get help when you need it. Even health care workers can be breathtakingly ignorant of what a range of symptoms seizures can have.I don't subscribe totally to the theory of there being a personality that goes with TLE but I am a slightly different person since I have been medicated so itis hard to tell. I think the book could be a good primer for someone trying to understand this condition better. I also think it would be interesting to see an updated version because their is lot more information out there than there was when this book first cameout..
3,Partly my fault,When I purchased this recording I faisled to realize how much of the enjoyment of their performance is dependent on the magnetism of Mr. Rieu and the enthusiasm of his orchestra. As you can appreciate none of this comes through in just a plain recording. Now I am just probably a below average listener but to me it sounds just like any other recording orchestra playing waltzes. In orther words do not expect the excitment and enjoyment when the music is coupled with visuals .
3,Music different from title,"The title of this CD was misleading. I wanted an entire CD of Viennese waltzes to play at a party, and was disappointed that there were marches, etc. on the CD. A better title would've been ""The Vienna I Love, Music From My Heart""."
1,not worth the money,Don't bother with this book. At almost $11 I could have gotten a much better quality and involved version of Nature. This book is simple and good to bring on a hiking trip but it's not worth more than $3. If i could do it again I would get a book with a variety of Emerson's works including this. If nothing else buy this book from a known publisher so you don't end up with something that was put together in someones garage with a fancy printer.
4,Ralph Waldo Emerson free,"Ralph Waldo Emerson free for my Kindle 3G. Lots of reading, easy and free download. There are lots of other free ebooks,"
4,Their second best album.,"I gave this 4-stars because I liked their album 'Ave End' as the best. Christopher is the best of the singers this band has gone through. This is what a ""real"" man sounds like, not those high-pitched wimp-boys that stupid teen girls swoon over. This album is excellent with 3 charted Goth-10's ""My Velvet Little Darkness"", ""Again It's Over"" and ""Sweet Caroline"". ""Short Glance"" is a great ballad that reaches deep into your soul and ""Sad Theme for a Marriage"" like-wise is just that. The powerfulness of ""My Mescaline"" is a great finale to a superb composition. I recommend this fully."
4,This is certainly the best of Lacrimas Profundere,All Thou it is clear that they are not musical geniuses I can't ignore the great vocals and the raw emotions in the lyrics. If you are into songs that take pleasure in the darkness and relish the sadness of ones soul then you most hear My Mescaline and do not hesitate on baying their other material&#9787;
3,Sam Phillips--not the record producer!,"I'm talking about Sam Phillips, Penthouse Pet. Tall, blonde and busty, she has no equal amongst the '90s era pin-ups.Now, this DVD appears to hold two episodes of the odd late-night series Hot Springs Hotel, a sometimes funny, many times sexy, show about two babes (Sam Phillips and Glori Gold) who run a hotel where people have a lot of sex. As this was a Showtime series the sex consists of that lame '90s softcore crap where people would move slightly, but they still had most of their clothes on. The nudity is pretty much topless only; and the real problem with HSH was the lack of Sam and Glori nudity. There were times were they would go several episodes without even wearing something less revealing than their hotel uniforms. And seeing as how this DVD contains only two episodes, well, don't be expecting to see the lovely Sam naked anytime soon."
2,ehh..,"i LOVE lightning bolt, but i have to say that this album doesn't display their talent very well. if you don't own any lightning bolt records, i strongly reccomend purchasing ""wonderful rainbow"" or ""ride the skies"", rather than this one. this album is a lot more experimental than their newer work, and comes off as kind of sloppy.i am all about noise-rock, but this album didn't really do it for me. if you do intend on buying this one though, expect bad quality recordings, mediocre songwriting (for lightning bolt, that is), and a 32 minuet song made up of noises and random effects."
2,"Sound great, music mediocre","Yes, the sound is great in stereo, very involving and sharp (its a virtual orchestra) and one or two tracks are quite interesting. Unfortunately, with the exception of the title track, the rest are of the music is fairly derivitave and ""samey"". So, of you want to show off your hifi, then get it, but if you want a rewarding musical experience, look elsewhere."
3,1963 set far superior,"Good though these performances are, the 1963 ones are far better, perhaps with the exception of the 6th. The performance of it in this set has the best scherzo I have ever heard, with the repeat intact and oboe and horn playing that are out of this world (not at all like peasants, but never mind) and I never tire of listening to it. But that's where it ends. The first movement of the Eroica is misty and much too fast, a far cry from the superb offering Karajan gave us in 1963, the same goes for the 4th symphony. It reminded me of thick gluggy gravy. The 7th is very well articulated and hard to fault, and yet something is missing that is present on the 1963 recording. Go for the earlier set which has the best 3rd, 4th, 7th 8th and 9th ever made."
3,"and we're lost out here in the stars, little stars, big stars ...","almost an artifact today, as this pseudo costa-gavras take on south africas apartheid system is a bit heavy handed, but the power of donald sutherlands performance as a naive afrikaaners school teacher who awakens to the horrors of his comfortable sheltered life when a loyal family retainer is abducted and murdered by the police cannot be denied. while the character is a bit too naive to be credible, the impact of how he is betrayed by his friends and his own family (save for his young son, who is btw a very beautiful boy) raises the level. now interestingly, the main reason this movie is remembered at all is the greatest flaw in its structure: the overwhelming turn by marlon brando as an attorney who shows up mid-way thru the film, dominates it for half an hour, and then completely disappears into the vapors; brando gives one of his great late performances here -- but sadly it disjoints the movie. still, all in all, a worthy effort."
1,My opinion of Glenn Madeiros,"Although I've always been a fan of Glenn Madeiros (especially his duet with the dutch Ria Brieffies (member of the very famous dutch popgroup the Dolly Dots)), I must say this album isn't one of his greatest... Does the term Worst album in the world ... EVER mean anything to you. But, if one should like to listen to Madeiros' greatest hit, Nothing's gonna change my love for you, one might want to try the dutch counterpart: Kayak."
3,Acceptable,"Because it is not immediately evident from the information posted on this selection, prospective purchasers should know that this book is a part of the ""standard"" bilingual (Greek/English) Loeb Classical Library. As such, it is a fine academic work, and a decent addition to any classical library. However, potential buyers should also know that the writings of Manetho contained in this volume are only ""as quoted by other writers"" (e.g. Eusebius and Josephus). As such, the work reflects (often infuriatingly so) as much the opinions and biases of these ancient ""reviewers"" as it does of Manetho's actual words. Apart from this ""caveat emptor,"" anyone interested in Egyptian history and religion as viewed by an Egyptian of the third century BC -- albeit re-viewed by sometimes antipathetical critics -- is advised to add this small volume to his or her collection."
4,Good product - Don't order through Amazon.com,"I performed a Yahoo Shopping! search for this LASER photo paper because I had used it before and wanted more. Yahoo directed me to Amazon.com who, in turn, connected me with a merchant that would fulfill my need.When my order arrived, it had been filled with glossy INKJET photo paper. This paper would ruin my color LASER printer if used. When I phoned the merchant involved, I was advised that they didn't even stock the item I'd ordered and Amazon.com advertised.Ultimately, I purchased the Laser paper under review directly from Konica-Minolta (at the same price advertised by Amazon.com). I'm quite satisfied with Konica-Minolta, their service, and their price. This is a good product for laser printer users; it's just hard to find."
2,"Saves Only, Not Action","The people at datel have been very mixed with the uses of the action Replay for each of their systems. They've had ones with great codes like the Gamecube and Playstation 2, and there are ones that haven't delivered with the promise of great games. That can definitely be declared as a dissapointment with the PSP edition. This one you can go to the codejunkies.com website, and download saves that make it too easy to beat the game, rather than codes that just enhance and deliver the excitement on the game. That is the sad part. Other than it doubling as a memory card, it doesn't actually work as something that makes it fun to play games like Daxter, or Lumines. Although I would normally suggest this as a must buy, this one doesn't hit the mark at all.Price: DConvience: D 1/2+Overall: D"
1,Not Worth Your Money Or Time,"If you got this product when PSP first came around then this would actually be a worthwhile cheat device. While I was able to cheat one game in the past, I updated my PSP and the AR Max no longer worked. In fact the instructions on getting it to work did nothing. I tried contacting the site about this problem but recieved no reply. There are far better things you can use than this paper weight."
1,Fail,i was looking forward to getting this action replay i have had some in the past for older systems and they all worked great then i came to this one and thought ok lets give this a try and i am completely disappoint with the out come of it all i can really say is don't waste your money
3,Read the original!,"It's an okay book, but nothing close to the original. ""The Small One"" was actually written by Charles Tazewell, best known for ""The Littlest Angel"". Tazewell's version, which is heartbreakingly beautiful, is out of print. If you can lay your hands on a copy via your local library or a used book store, do!"
4,The Small One,"I love this story!! I bought it years ago for my daughter. Now I am buying it for friends children. It is a heartwarming tale for young children. I really love, love, love it!"
4,A Sweet Story,"I didn't even know this short film was made into a book! For me, I remember watching this film when I was a little girl. This book brings back fond memories of watching this on the Disney Channel around Christmas time. It's a sweet story with a beautiful ending about a humble little donkey who has a very special job to do. Disney would never create a film like this with a Christian focus in today's age, so, in my opinion, this is a rare find."
2,False Advertising,"When I bought this copy of The Small One, it stated it was New. Not Like new, and not excellent shape used. But when I went to write my niece's name in the cover, I found that ""Grandma"" had already wished ""Her Little Caroline"" a Merry Christmas back in 2000.Luckily I thought to cover the inscription with a Christmas label and go from there...but I was still unhappy about paying $30 for a book that was 10 years old, printed $12.95 on the cover, and previously used."
4,CRISIS,"el cd comienza con la cancion Crisis, este cd fue el primer discode alaska y dinarama....solo que en aquel entonces de la separacion de Alaska y los Pegamoides comenzaria un nuevo rumbo para Alaska, ya que el mismo cd y la cancion crisis tambien la agrupacion estaba en risis en como se llamaria el grupo ya que Carlos Berlanga (qepd)queria dejar Alaska como segunda voz y la agrupacion seriaDinarama mas Alaska, pero como Alaska se merecia mas que una segunda voz... entonces el grupo se llamaria Alaska y Dinaramacon el cual el cd de deseo carnal les habria las puertas en America especialmente en Mexico con su conosidima cancionNi Tu ni Nadie, en este cd encontras temas como el egeo, perlas ensangretadas,cebras y las canciones que Alaska siempre canta en sus eventos, kali y sacerdotisas del baal."
4,Finally!,"It's great to have straight talk about the whole range of recovery options available from one source, with a minimum of axe-grinding. People struggling with addictions and their friends and families will find this an invaluable resource. Personally I'm a bit more positive about 12 step and more skeptical of some of the alternatives than the authors, but what's important is that they're all in here and the authors make a serious attempt to evaluate them objectively. We all know someone who needs this book!"
2,not the best clamp I have ever used,"The pipe clamp does work, but it has a tendency to slip on the pipe if you try to tighten it down very much. The release to slide the clamp end up and down the pipe is hard to use (this also the part that slips when you tighten it down.) You have get you finger under a lever and lift it up to move this piece rather than just pushing it down like some other models. Again, it does work but if I had not used a gift certificate to buy it I would probaly ship it back for a refund."
2,like peeing with your pants up,"Two Stars-one because it really is metal and two it does work----how ever poor threads,faces rough,and a lot of slop,this is the stuff that craftsman tools put their name on, and we know where they are headed,IT GETS THE JOB DONE,like peeing with your pants up but wish you had them down,but I would get Adjustable,Jorgensen,Bessey---Spend the small amount of extra money and be HAPPY---I mean every time I use these clamps ,every time I wish I got the better ones,Don Gorman"
5,The Best Book on Intimate Relationships,"As a professional in the field, I have read a lot of books on self-help and relationship building and have found this one the unqualified best. It is gutsy, compassionate, full of hope and full of practical experiences of the huge issues we face in being ourselves and being with another. My first wife and I read it several years ago while she was terminally ill with cancer and found it so helpful then. Now, as another person and I are discovering love together, I am finding it extremely helpful again as we read it together and discuss it as a way to discover and deepen our intimacy."
4,I wanted to learn something about Control Creation,"However, I began to hit a brick wall with some of the examples (after the 5th chapter). Book assumes you know VB language, and that you just need to know how to use it to create activeX controls. Although it wasn't as helpful as I had hoped, I did give it 4 stars because a VB programmer WILL find this book useful. And the stuff that I could do made for some great learning about control creation."
1,Use caution when ordering!,I ordered a size 12 Wide as that is the size that fits best in my other Stacy Adams shoes. But I had to return these because there was no way I was getting my foot in these shoes. Where the tongue goes down and forms the top of the shoe is extremely tight and narrow and I could not get my foot in it. Had to return them for a refund.
3,Good publication but needs a CD,"Has some great explanations and examples. Unfortunately Im one who needs to hear the example as well as read it. I can play all the notes of ""Home sweet home"" ""Wildwood flower"" and ""Way down yonder"" as written in the book, but can barely recognize the tunes. Ive looked on Youtube, Itune and Google for performances by the author but it seems this is all he did. A CD to accompany this book would be great!"
1,doesnt teach how to build crosspicking arrangements,"hello, I bought this book looking how to arrange for crosspicking on guitar. It simply doesnt do that. it has tabs. and some simple right hand patterns. dont get this if you want to learn how apply crosspicking to songs outside of what is given in this book (which are already arranged} if you want tabs, just look on the internet."
2,Disappointed,"If you know how to cross pick, then you might like this book. I am looking for an intro to cross picking that starts easy and then builds to harder songs. Obviously, the author knows how to cross pick. I hope he puts out another book geared for someone new to cross picking."
1,Pictures to CD & DVD,"I was very dissapointed in this software. You can only aquire pictures from a digital camera or a scanner.I have several folders of pictures on my PC hard drive and I can't down load them into this program. 5 emails to Magix about this problem and so far they asked me to send them some of my pictures to look at ""?"". In there return emails not one gave me a way to down load from my hard drive. This would be a great program except for this one problem."
1,Poor picture quality,"After my recent vacation, I was excited to find this program and to share copies of my digital pictures with friends and family who could watch them on their TVs. The program had some nice features and seemed easy to use. Unfortunately, I spent too much time putting my slideshow together without testing the end result first. The pictures I took were high resolution (1200x1600) but the resulting quality when watching the CD on my TV was very poor."
2,Not heavy duty,"I found the level material of a thin build, not of a heavy duty grade. It was also shipped missing 1 of the 2 end caps. Stanley did send a new one, but it was the wrong size. I bought an Empire box level which I prefered over the Stanley"
3,4 foot stanley level,A nice level - but the plastic end caps come in a bag for you to put on andI only got one. emailed and they shipped me a new set very quickly - onlyproblem - you guessed it :0 way wrong size. No answer to next email.
3,"Nice resource, lousy ""maps""","I found the written information here extremely helpful and informative but I dont think I'm being overly critical when I say the ""maps"" were simply embarrassing. It's a book about finidng locations to fish and the maps literally look as if they were traced off other maps with a magic marker by a child. Of course you'd use detailed maps of your own getting to a spot you might not know but I only wish the caliber of the maps were of the same caliber as the information in the rest of the book.Peter G"
3,Partially Promising,"There are 10 total chapters to this book, but only one chapter that has any potential at all to ""change your life"" as the author promises will happen to you once you finish his book or, at least, his introduction.That one chapter is Chapter 8, ""Crying and Personal Transformation."" In it the author advises the reader to stay with the feelings that evoked the tears, to make new connections to them, and to deepen the effects of what you lived through.All the other chapters are fact-driven bits of trivia, written like an almanac or database on the subject of tears, none of which are engaging for any length of time, let alone helpful to the promise of changing your life. Most pervasive were the author's observations on fake tears and on tears for the purpose of manipulating others.To get to the really deep meaning of tears, you need only read Chapter 8."
3,Half of it is worthless,"The title of this book should have been ""Color sets that the authors say are dither-safe in browsers"". The useful part is section 6, the rest is cheesy intros, spelling errors, bad English and contradictory statements. The expository part of this book is hastily and sloppily written, not edited, confused, incorrect, repetitive--nearly useless that is. Printed on shiny paper which is hard to read because of glare. The book's very heavy--if you read it in bed you'll end up with carpal tunnel syndrom. The tables are useful though. The book's very pretty, well designed and produced. Still, I think the price is too high, I think."
2,Little updated from moderately useful 1st edition,"While the other two books in this series, ""Designing"" and ""Deconstructing Web Graphics,"" benfited from their respective revisions, there is little new information in this book, and the price tag is way too steep for a book of moderate usefulness anyway. Most of what you need to know here is repeated in the other books. If you must have it, try to find the first edition on close-out. And if Ms. Weinman must udpate all of her books, I hope that next time she waits until she has something new to say."
1,Not one you should read!,"Weinman is like a smooth talking salesperson that's trying to sell you a lemon! Sure it comes wrapped in a pretty package but after you rode test it, you find out you just bought an old car with a new paint job.She openly admits that she never even created a Web site before she wrote her first Web book. Get a copy of Designing Web Graphics and read a few pages. You'll quickly see what I mean.I've bought three Weinman books because that's all I ever heard about when it comes to design. It is a shame to say that none of the books ever had a single new idea. More like old ideas, re-presented in as Weinman talkology lessons.I am very disappointed with the book. With such a hefty price tag, you'd expect a few new ideas! I will never buy another Weinman book. Ever!"
1,Cute Cover... Inside is Useless - ZERO STARS if possible,"What web designer isn't on the lookout for snazzy new color combinations? I took a look at this book in the store and bought it quickly since I was in a hurry. As I started working through it, I became more and more frustrated. This book does the UNBELIEVABLE! The colors used in the print of the book to demonstrate color combos are NOT the same when you manually enter the RGB values in Photoshop (or any other image editor I've tried). This is UNFORGIVABLE in a book whose only redeeming value is its color swatches and text/background color suggestions. Please, believe me, save your money. I haven't picked this book up since I the day after I bought it."
2,watered down,"the bottles were smaller than I had imagined (and I knew they'd be small). the caps are almost impossible to get off. I have to get the cap off with my teeth. I hope they manufacture the regular size spray soon, or ever."
3,Not bad,Not a bad tape measure. Not the highest quality - but it gets the job done on the cheap. I use it as a throw down tape measure when I don't want to risk loosing my nice one.
3,Predictable but good,"I think if I would of read this book at a young age I would have probably given it 5 stars but as an adult I found it too predictable. I figured out the ending a quarter of the way through the book. Nonetheless, I thought it was still an enjoyable read and written well.It's about a girl named Sarah who nearly drowned. Because of that near death experience she has become more sensitive to spirits. When her family moves to Houston, the house they move in immediately feels wrong to Sarah. It's not long before a ghost there contacts her and asks her for help. Sarah starts to do some detective work but there is someone out there that wants to keep the secrets hidden. Now her life might depend on discovering the truth.Definitely would recommend this book to the younger crowd. Maybe 12-15 years of age."
5,Kept me going from beginning to end,I liked this book very much and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to read an exciting mystery. The book always keeps the reader guessing. I didn't figure out who was the murderer was until nearly the end of the story. The visions that the heroine kept having were very strange and it was interesting seeing her slowly make the connections between her visions and figuring out who was the murderer. It was a lot of fun to read this book and I think you will enjoy it as much as I did.
5,whispers,"The book is very good the way the girl has hulucinations and hears the voices in her head. In the book a girl named Sarah moves to houston,TX. She moves in to a house and there was a murder that took place in the house from the people that useto live in the there. She finds out that the voices from her head are from the person that was killed. So thoughout the book she has to try to help the girl that was murderedand she does reach her and trys to help her. The book is a shreeker it will have you on the edge of your seat. I suggeust you get the book!"
3,"""Strange Whispers, from the Dead""","1. Sarah Darnell is a thirteen-year-old girl who used to live in Texas. When she was living there, she almost drowned in a lake nearby her house. Ever since the incident, she had been hearing whispers in her house. She later finds out that the whispers are coming from a ghost that had been following her around ever since her incident. Years later, she moves to a new state, and the ghost moves with her. Soon after she moves, she hears whispers again, only they're in Spanish. She believes that this ghost could bring her great danger...2.I liked this book because it was exciting and it kept you guessing until the end.3.This book is kind of related to ""A Murder in the Doll House"" because they both have ghosts following people around in both stories."
4,Bags looks great,"The bags look great(2 of them), they are real, and I received mine with a store tag and the auth. card. I've seen one review of someone that had the Auth. card and it stated made somewhere in the US. Not here(Italy). This is a great price and a great gift to give. Sure you could go to the flea market and get one for 10$'s but sometimes it is nice to surprise someone special with something real. Bottom line the bag is great, but Amazon's shipping sucks. It took forever to get here. So I would but another bag but I cannot bring myself to order from Amazon again. Hope this helped."
5,"The wife liked it, so....","I thought it was an ok bag. Decently-made, given the materials. The wife loved it, mostly because of the brand.For the price, this is just about a perfect gift."
2,Something's not quite right.,"I ordered two of these bags - one to keep and one to give as a gift - and they'd don't even match each other. They seem to have authentic looking logo labels and authenticity card, but the zipper/hardware seems horribly cheap. The zippers are two totally different colors on the bags I got. I'm not sure if they're ""real"" or not, but they aren't consistantly constructed."
3,Excellent grip,"Frightfully low mass, and the leather bound to the hilt provides for an excellent tight grip. The hole drilled for the tang of the sabre blade may require some adjustment."
4,The first computer book that made me want to write a review!,"As someone who writes a little HTML now and then, I've accumulated several books on HTML going back to Version 3.2.This is the best one yet, because it takes you one step at a time through each facet of HTML, letting you understand the various tags and attributes by having you use all of them in a logical progression until you have created a complete site.I'm using the book basically as a review, while learning to write using XHTML, using CSS to describe all the formatting--which is not the way I learned the first time.The lessons are fun, and easy to follow. I would have given it 5 stars, if there were not a few mistakes here and there that should have been caught in the editing process."
3,"Great book format, easy to learn, but older technology.","Just like my review title says, I really liked the format of this book. The material is presented in a very easy to use, easy to learn format. Well presented step-by-step way to create a website. The only problem is that the book is based on an older, less used, technology called ""frames"". Most websites of today are not designed using frames. For this reason I would strongly recommend looking for a similar book that doesn't build a site based on frames."
3,HTML Complete Course,The editing on this book is so poor that I was constantly rechecking instructions on how to proceed. When I tried to email the publisher and/or author I got no response. I was finally helped by a techie who had sympathy for my plight and got me through the rough spots. If the editing had been better I think I could recommend this book. As it is I cannot and will not!
2,Not for fans of the original,"In my opinion the first TCSM, together with Kubrick's The Shining, is one of the greatest horror movies ever made. It is truly a masterpiece. The sequel isn't. This film is not funny, it's not scary, it's just depressing and even disgusting. Leatherface is not what he used to be and the whole concept of where the ""Sawyers"" (!) now live is simply ridiculous and unbelievable. The 2 stars for a few enjoyably (and unintentionally) stupid moments and Hopper's chainsaw-waving scene."
2,Why make a sequal to something that sucked to begin with,"If it wasn't for the fact that Dennis Hopper was in this and did his role well this would of gotten less. For christ sake can a slasher film get any more dull.The movie starts off 14 years after the first (and the theatrical release was 12 years later). The whole idea is that Dennis Hopper wants to get revenge for what happened to his nephew Frankie (The wheel chair kid in the first) and hid neice (Who was committed). That wouldn't be enough though so they throw in some punk kids who call a radio DJ on a cell phone and then get killed by LEather Face. She takes the tape to Hopper who then asks for her to play the tape on her station and lure them out.... The question is how one specific member of his clan survive, the brother. If I recall he was ran over several times by a semi in the first, he should be dead.This movie is just a waste of time, don't bother checking into it."
1,THIS TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE IS POINTLESS!!!!!!!,"I have to say i love the first and the newest one and the third,but this one here is pointless and are boogeymen leatherface decides to go softy on us!!!!!!! If i wanted to watch a love story then i would have rented a drama and that this one should have been in that section!!!!!!! Try to avoid this sequel it has no story, no imagination, and leatherface was just plan stupid in it!!!!!! DO NOT RENT OR BUY THIS MOVIE IT'S NOT WORTH WASTING YOUR MONEY ON!!!!!!"
2,didn't live up to its potential,This movie was boring. But it wasn't the worst in the series. Rent before you buy it. I made the mistake of buying before renting
1,This Film [stinks]- Big Time!!,"I originally bought this because a) it was not available in the UK at the time and b) because the DVD was cheap. I still wish I had not bothered. This film is dire. For one thing it is not half as violent as I was expecting it to be, and lets face it, without the violence this film has little to recommend it. I thought the first movie was overrated, but Tobe Hooper has come no where near as close to making a decent movie since. Half the scenes appear to be direct rip-offs from the first film, the 'humour' is terrible and the prescence of Dennis Hopper adds little to the film. This will sit on my shelf gathering dust until I can pawn it off onto another person with a multi-region DVD player."
3,A Fair Sequel to a True Classic,"The Texas Chainsaw MAssacre being one of my all time favorite films to date, I was inclined to watch every subsequent chainsaw film. This film, made several years later and on a higher budget, while a fantastic horror masterpiece, was not as good as the original or the sequel which followed it. However, great gore sequences (More gore than the original) and tense horror action make this film a must see for any fan of the genre. I give this film a 3, or maybe a 3.5. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to horror fans."
3,Bad sequel....good horror,This is a GOOD horror film. However... its a BAD sequel. Not half as bad as ones that followed though. This film is pretty scary...but in a complete differnt way than the original... instead of being insane this is more of a bigger budget closterphobic kind of scary. You will however enjoy seeing the original family again...even if having different personalities. Plus... you get to see Franklin's skeleton and hear what happened to Sally from the first film.
5,Tobe's Sickest Joke,"For anyone reading this in Australia I would fully recommend this film. Picture the first film mixed with Road Runner....no Ren and Stimpy on acid and you still wouldn't even be close. Because this film was banned in 1987 (and if a label put it up for release today it would pass with an R or even an MA) it has never seen the light of day down under, except in bootleg form. But trust me it's worth getting an import of it because of the bold colors and lighting, something that is lost on the boots."
4,The Buzz is back!,"Not as good as the original, but fun. Directed again, by Tobe Hopper, and starring Dennis Hopper. Ten times better than the two that followed. If you havn't seen the original see that, then this. Enjoy"
3,More Twisted and Gorier than the first,"Leatherface and his family are back in this very cheesy black comedy. Loaded with wall to wall blood and guts and lots of action sequences. Actually quite a worthy sequel, although the way they tried to add black humour is far too silly and a true TCM fan wouldn't like it. Above all, a great movie if your in the mood."
1,A Texas Sized Stink Bomb,"I don't know what most of the other reviewers were watching but the Texas Chainsaw Massacre II that I saw was 100% pure sorry. Except for the opening scene with the kid getting his head chopped off it wasn't scary at all and it was out and out stupid. Chop Top, Leatherface and the rest of the family were pretty funny but that's the only good thing about this sorry movie. The female protagonist couldn't act her way out of a paper bag and the ending with her swinging the saw was very stupid. While I was watching it in the theatre a lot of people walked out before the ending with one guy sarcastically saying ""It got too scary."" Don't waste your time or money with this junk."
1,Don't waste your time,"The idea is frightfully unnerving and executed with appropriate panache for a film of this type, but the unnecessary delineation with ridiculous black comedy completely destroys any praiseworthiness this movie can aspire to...Hooper needs to concentrate less on comedy and more on artful frightening of people if he wants to make a good movie...The Halloween series is much better than any of the garbage in the series of overrated flicks this turkey belongs to..."
4,fun and exciting,any texas fan must have this for all the extras on this version of the classic film and uncut finally
3,Black Comedy Horror - Says it all,"Horror movies and Comedies (in my humble opinion) say more about what's happening in the world and how people really are than any other genre. TCM2 is hilarious and disgusting in all the best ways.I saw another movie like this recently (obviously heavily inspired by TCM franchise)... ROADSIDE MASSACRE. It has this great speech at the end where the bad guy goes on a rant exclaiming he has the right to kill & eat the teens on his property because of the US tax code, and can even write-off the cost of killing everyone in next years taxes. Dark, twisted, hilarious.Chainsaw Massacre changed it all.Roadside Massacre"
2,Way to Sick and Twisted,"This is one of those movies were even if you have an iron cast stomach you are going to be nausiated. If it isn't because of the extreme violence then it is the guy constantly picking his scalp with a coat hanger and eating it (just thinking about it makes me sick). Then there is this whole thing with Leatherface molesting some poor girl with his chainsaw! I swear that was the most uncomfortable moment in any movie ever.The only reason I didn't give this movie one star was because at least it had some minor dark comedy. Like the fact that the family makes award winning chilly with a special ingrediant (don't forget they are cannibals). Plus there are some great scenes, but then they are quickly wrecked by turning into an overly violent mess.Only watch this movie if you can handle barf bag gore or have a very sick mind."
3,Simple Ok Horror Flick,"I am a Horror Buff so anytime I see a good deal on a horror Blu-Ray I snap it up. I got this flick for under $5 so I snapped it up. While I had seen it before, I thought I liked it more. It was just ok for me this time. I actually like the newer remake ones over this one. While it was worth the $5 I was glad I didn't spend anymore to add to my collection-- It is worth a watch, not really worth owning unless you can get a deal like I did."
4,Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2,I bought this DVD to finish my collection. I now have all the Texas Chainsaw Massacre DVD's in the series. One night I will be able to have a Massacre marathon.
5,LICK MY PLATE!!,"If Texas Chainsaw Massacre is the King of Redneck Horror, here reigns the Duke. Take one serving of Leatherface, add in some Dennis Hopper, and kick it in the teeth with Bill Moseley as Chop Top, and you have a winning recipe for your next batch of cannibal chili. The secret's in the meat, friends.While it lacks the serious, wet-your-pants horror of the first movie, this humourous spin has what it takes to make mouths happy. This chainsaw fan can't argue with anything involving Dennis Hopper wielding twin chainsaws in order to send his arch-enemies back to hell, while Leatherface shows his softer side and woos a disc-jockeying chickie. Even more fun is the random addition of Chop Top(Bill Mosely, of House of 1000 Corpses fame) and his Vietnam veteran antics.If you're ready to settle down and take your TCM a little less seriously, slop yourself up a bowl-full of this film. It aims to please."
4,do you like horror movies?,"this one is a doozie. its rich with the spirit of horror. the first TCM is of course untouchable.. that's why this one doesn't even try to top it. i don't understand all these people talking about how its too gory. they must not like horror. if your idea of horror is The Exorcist and The Others, you may want to skip this one. if you like Re-Animator or Dead Alive.. or if you felt compelled in the 80s to see all the Friday the 13th and Nightmare flicks, no matter how bad you knew they were going to be, you'll get something out of this twisted little cracker jack of a flick."
5,The greatest bad movie of all time.,"This movie is great after you've had a few. It's so bad, it's good."
3,Chainsaw Fun!,"I've only seen an edited version of The Texas Chainsaw Masacre Part 2. And it wasn't that gory. I'm still looking for the full version, so I can rate it three stars if it is good enough. This movie is really hilarious. Chop-Top is the funniest. He fought in the war. Imagine with no food, but dead bodies everywhere, which would he prefer? Bodies of course. I thought he was the guy who got hit by the truck in Part 1. But this was a different man.If you want to rent this, then I suggest you look at the back of the over first. If there is a sticker that reads something like color/92 mins. Then you're not going to see much. But if there is no length sticker at all, then that is the one to get. I too am looking for that version. There will read a 100 mins. time length if it is the full version, but it ain't a sticker. That is how you'll know.This movie ain't too bad, though."
3,Not as good as the first but still alright,Did I rent an r rated version or what this movie is not as gorey as everyone says.There is only one part thats gorey and thats it you dont even see the guys head get cut off at the beginning.But besides that leatherface has changed into a wimp that wont even kill this DJ.Also the DJ just keeps screaming.And Dennis Hopper just keeps screaming bring it all down as he cuts the familys house down.The only good thing about it is the performences by the family.
3,Good sequal to a Great Movie,"Let me start off by saying this movie was less than what I was expecting. The first half of the movie was great. I started thinking it was better than the first... but as the movie went on, it got kinda boring in a way. Leatherface acted kinda different than he did in the origanall movie. He spares a girls life so he can try and have sex with her later. near the end it seems more like a remake than a sequal. The same things happend just as they did in the first one. Like with the Grandpa trying to hit the girl with the hammer, and the girl trys to run away and the brother runs after her outside. The part I dont understand is how the hell the brother is alive again???? In the first one he got killed by a truck! But he is still alive in this one. Overall I would say this is a good sequal to a great movie."
3,Nam Land!,"Unlike the first chainsaw massacre, this adds a bit of dark humor to it's horror atmosphere some of which is funny, and some thats not. Once again this Ed Gein inspired film features no onscreen dismemberment but the scenes that involve gore are well executed, and tastefully overdone, they more than make up for seeing someone sawed into pieces. The story is a bit lacking with this one (not helped by Dennis Hopper's unusualy lame preformance). Altough not the worst of these four films its not the best either, personaly i think it could have been alot better. I'd stick with the first film."
2,"If you blink, you may miss it!!!","Had TCM2 been about thirty minutes longer, more detail, and a little more Hopper vs. Leatherface duel, it would be a four or five star flick. Not as scarry as the first, we know what to expect. Texas Chain Saw Massacre,(1), is by far better. My tape, from Amazon, is slightly, but no biggie, defected. The top half of the screen ""warps"". Oh Well!!!"
2,gory but just too flimsy a plot,"What is Dennis Hopper DOING in this movie!!! Apart from the occasional scenes of decent gore there is little to no redeeming overall marks. However, the scene in which Leatherface (or ""Bubba"" as he is called in this sequel to TCM)massages his chainsaw up a woman's thiegh, to which she asks whether he can actually ""Get it up"". This and all tcm-like movies have since been banned in the u.k."
5,Got me riled up pretty good!!!!,"After the 1st movie, I was anxious to watch the 2nd film. This one was scary and gruesome to me. There was some funny parts to the movie, like how the villians had a sense of humor. They weren't the vicious types like in the 1st film.The protagonist is most likely going to be the chainsaw killer in part 3. So I will have to wait unitl I see that movie."
1,Utter travesty riffing on a brilliant original,"It's almost impossible to believe that the same director made the original TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE - spare, beautifully filmed and relentlessly terrifying... and this slack-jacked ugly-looking mess of camp garbage. MASSACRE 2 is played strictly for third-grade gross-out laughs throughout - there's not a scary moment in it. Dennis Hopper chews the MST3K-type scenery... Caroline Williams wears the face-skin of her dead friend, in one cringe-inducing sequence... and that's all, folks. A totally bankrupt imagination here - the unforgettable dinner-party sequence from MASSACRE 1 is recreated almost verbatim... complete with grandpa unable to ""get it up"", to bop screaming heroine on the head. TCSM 1 is a masterpiece - Number 2 is, literally, number two."
2,Bah It's alright...,"I picked up this DVD I think 2 weeks after I saw the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre for the first time. This was the first time I have seen this movie and I thought it was ok. The DVD is kinda goofy cause it doesn't have a good transfer, and the picture looks bad and grainy. The only extra is a... Trailor which picture is worse than the movie. The movie itself I found was fun but kinda goofy. The ending where Leatherface gets killed by a grenade is wack.... The DJ chick is annoying too. I'd buy this DVD if you got a couple bucks to spend."
3,its alright.,"a texas chainsaw massacre obsessed guy played by dennis hopper goes after the gaines family with his own chainsaw.this of course isnt true.dennis hopper is the star.i dont need to tell you to not let your kids watch this.its not nearly as good as the all time halloween time classic we saw with the original.ive never seen the rest.its pretty gross in a few spots,but what did you expect?its about a chainsaw wielding psycho!its not true like the first one was.dennis hoppers performances in easy rider and flashback far outweigh this one."
5,Great Romantic Movie for All,"Some couples have Titanic as their movie, not us. My boyfriend and I love this movie. It is our Titanic. We must watch it every time we get together. He did like the first as much as the second one. I personaly think the first is classic."
4,exciting adventure in horror,This film was my favorite in the series. It leaves you really tense in some scenes. I think Caroline Williams did a great job in this film. I love her screams. I think she also played a good disc jockey in the film. Some parts could have been really done without. I didn't like how they portrayed letherface in this film. I mean they made him look like such a wuss that he wasen't very scary in this one.
3,TCM2 another classic,"Texas Chainsaw Massacre part 2 is another Horror classic, This movie was not as good as the original but it's still scary. To bad Gunnar Hansen didn't play leatherface again. The only thing I didn't like about the movie was that they lived in a cave, I wished that they still lived in the house from the original movie"
3,Better then i thought it would be,"First off let me say i never saw the original TCM.ive seen trailers for it and it never attracted me,the remake however i really like.Tom Savini's effects are really good but there are only a handfull of kills.chop top really is the high point of this movie but its still a pretty good movie to watch.i found it enjoyable and even funny at times.i know people who like the original dont like this one but honestly the original TCM looks boring,i LOVE horror and have never been interested in seeing it until the remake.i recomend you at least rent this one to see it as this is a ""hate it or love it""type of movie.but the chainsaw duel is just great to see and that alone is worth owning this movie for along with all the scenes with chop top."
2,the texas chainsaw massacure 2,"this movie I would have to say was pretty bad. There's a lot of action scenes, and blood scenes, but overall this movies sucked ass. To tell you straight out why it sucked was because it's a predictable story and leatherface looks like he got f$%#@@ in the face. You would of thought that maybe because Tobe hooper made the first one this would be good,(also he directed this one too). So rent if you want but don't waste your time hoping for a good movie to come out of this."
2,The secrets in the MEAT!,"I'm a huge fan of the 1974 original, but this one is just so-so. It could have been much better. Not the worst movie ever, but I expected better from Tobe. Probably better to rent this one if you've never seen it..."
5,TCM 2 on blu is the one for you,"Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 is a guilty pleasure for me. I cannot explain it, I just find it fun, with much willing suspension of disbelief. If you want the best looking edition, the blu ray is the one to buy. The print is in very fine condition. There is a wonderful, organic looking grain to the film (no DNR here). And this baby is loaded with supplements. If this movie is your cup of tea, then this blu ray is the disc to own...great job by Fox."
2,"Poor Sequel, Lost its ""magic""","I honestly loved The original Texas Chainsaw Massacre starring Marilyn Burns. The cast was likable, diverse, and great. The environments were dark, creepy, and mysterious. Even the original house has a bad feeling about it. The death scenes were gritty, original, and great for its time. That was the original...The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 however, is a poor sequel, installment, and ridiculous entry in the series. Why did they go from living in a house to a hole underground? Why does it contain more comedy than horror? The ending was even quick and unfortunate. You barely get any closure as to what happens to the remaining people and the deaths were quick and sparing. In fact, this film doesn't even feel like a Texas Chainsaw Massacre!Don't waste your money or time on TCM 2. The original (1974) and the remake (2004) are the best ones to go with."
4,dvd,very fast shipping but the piece that holds the dvd in place was broken and the disc was just sliding around in the case
2,WHATASEQUEL,"Pretty good slasher sequel that continues and ends the series' storyline...the director calls it a mistake, but I thought it was pretty cool for a movie of it's kind...this coming from a kid who loves films like Halloween, Fatal Attraction and Psycho...Tobe Hooper put it down! MGM'S DVD sucks, double sided, not restored, 1 extra [trailer], dumb cover art compared to what it could have on it, not in 2.35:1 widescreen, none of the deleted scenes included...see my point?"
1,STINKS,"The worst movie I ever saw. Even worse than the 90's version of THE HAUNTING and its real hard to be worse than that klunker. This is stupid, plotless and just plain old drivel.. AVOID AT ALL COSTS."
1,Don't buy this movie....,"I usally love horror movies, but this one is the worst movie ever made. It's predictable, the actors are horrible and the entire movie looked like it was made in 5 minutes. Don't buy this movie."
2,The Texas chainsaw masscre 2,"Leatherface is back! In fact so is most of the family in this maniacal sequel.Dennis Hopper stars as a retired lawman out to avenge the gruesome murder of his nephew , and Caroline Williams plays a disk jockey who helps him locate the butchers. Not Rated but loaded with repulsive gore."
4,Great Dark Comic Follow-Up To a Classic!,"The first Texas Chainsaw Massacre excelled in frightening scenes, with little or no gore, that were accented by clever writing and great directing. This movie, its sequel, has all of that... PLUS, it has some great comedic moments as well.The cast of this movie is what makes everything work so well. Dennis Miller is great in the role of Lefty, a man who's looking to avenge the torture (and, in Franklin's case, death) of his nephew and niece. Bill Moseley (sp?) is superb as well as Chop Top, the twin of the Hitch-Hiker from the first film. And as always, Jim Siedow (sp?) is wonderful as Cook. He has the line of the movie towards the end of the film.This film is one of those few sequels that actually builds on the greatness of its predecessor. It's one of my top ten horror movies and, if you're a big fan of the genre, I'm sure you'll enjoy it, too."
2,One Star if Hopper wasn't in it,"TCM 2 might actually lower your opion of the 5 star original. It's sloppy, cheesy, and poorly acted. The plot is often incoherant. Instead of scarring the audience, it repulses them with needlessly graphic violence. A trashy sequel to a wonderful horror movie."
1,Even One Star Is Too Good For This Film,"What happened? This film is an embarrassment to the 1974 classic. It's not at all scary, it has way too much gore, the acting is WAY over the top, and its unsuccessfull attempts at black humor make it goofy! Plus, I hated the way Leatherface and Stretch played out as the sentimental King Kong and his damsel in distress. I also kept wondering whatever happened to the family's secluded run down house? Now you could say they're living in luxury even! The annoying DJ Stretch is irritating just standing around screaming and not trying to save herself! And Dennis Hopper's character Enright doesn't help much either as he runs around sawing apart everything around him! I'm sorry Tobe Hooper, but you really blew it on this one."
3,Gruesome Edition pluses and minuses,"This is an entertaining movie, a legend of the drive-in threater circuit, but don't expect the masterpiece of the original Hooper classic. It's a satire in the same way Bride of Frankenstein was to the original Frankenstein (also helmed by it's original director). Being a big fan, I still only give it 3 stars, and the same goes for this ""Gruesome Edition"" disc. While the interviews and extras make this a must have for the fans, the picture quality on this disc leaves much to be desired. If you own the original MGM DVD release don't get rid of it as the supplied full screen version as more image perserved of the original film negative than any of the widescreen versions (including the infamous trucks driving by in the finale), and the original MGM DVD has the proper color and contrast that was originally seen in theaters and drive-ins, this print would have never made it out of the lab."
2,This was a horrible movie,"This movie terrible in almost every way. The only thing that saved it was that hilarious cop running around aimlessly around their base cutting random pillars, and the chainsaw fight he had with Leatherhead. And that brother with the silver plate on his head was more annoying than creepy. Every ten seconds he was on screen he would blurt out some random word. Then at the end you have that DJ twirling the chainsaw over her head just like Leatherface did at the end of the first one. If you can catch this on TV then give it a view just for the comedy aspects, but it doesn't deserve to become part of any collection."
4,Scary like Thanksgiving,"This movie actually scaird me. This is rare since horror films are like rollercoasters, the more you ride them, the less available you are to be played with by them. There is a very unique tone to this movie. For example, a scene where a character is talking to the dj and picking his scalp at the same time. It's not funny or goofy but actually disturbing. It's just real enough to be personal and plausable.It begins in society (safe, everday setting) and then, rather quickly, drags you out of it and into an underworld. This differs from other horror films because usually it begins in society but characters test the limits and leave society (like camping for example). Here the other-world visits her, visits her at work, no less, the picture of our everyday realities. Dennis Hopper is nice in this movie and he has some cool scenes but he is not the gem, the gem is of course the family. What these films are all about."
2,SO SO,"The texas chainsaw massacre 2 is good in its own way, if your into sick twisted stuff, i myself was hoping this movie to be ultra violent and loads of gore but when i saw it for the first time i was very dissapointed as there is hardly any gore and no features on the DVD which fully sucks as they could have put the uncut scenes in. anyhow this movie is still watchable but a bit budget if you are a true horro fan BUY IT otherwise dont bother."
2,does leatherface make you honey bebe',"well..leatherface sure wants to score.lol..14 years after the origional , the texas chainsaw massacre 2 was released , and wasnt nearly as good as the 1st . i really dont have much to say bout this 1 but the movie itself was kinda corney but the humor and kills saved the movie..all i can say is this movie was good enough to buy but i would recomend the vhs cuz this 1 doesnt have all that much goin 4 it.."
3,If you like sick humor.....,"The Sawyer Clan will provide lots of gore and cheap laughs in this ghastly but hilarious sequel. Bill Mosely { ""Chop Top"" } and Jim Siedow { ""Cook"" } are under-rated in this movie. They were hilarious!"
4,Horror Can Be Funny,"This is the type of movie that makes you laugh and shudder while watching. For each scene of entrails spilling out of a wall or ""incoming mail"" hammer shot, there's jokes about Leatherface's destruction of Chop Top's Sonny Bono wig and Cook's views on the trials and tribulations of small business owners. Excellent pick for those days when ordinary horror just isn't enough."
4,Overall a good movie,It is a great movie but it is not as good as the first. I would have given it 5 stars but it has some comedy in it. If you liked the first one this one is worth renting.
5,Leatherface killed her once already tonight,Very good follow up leatherface and his clan hacking up more sweet meat for that tasty chili..it's one of my favs remember when it came out wanted to go to the movies to see it so bad but had to wait for the video..watching the bootleg version a lot was left out that now days would have been left in...has its funny points too like like my plate you dog di.k...some people like some don't but I one who likes it....RIP Jim siedow
3,Just OK,"Only for fans. I know, I know... it's a Tobe Hooper film and all. But it's a sad sequel. Poor and lousy. I wouldn't buy it. And I did."
2,Quality,Being that the movie is older even before DVD's came out. It was really not worth getting on Bluray. But it is a very good movie. That's why I purchased it and was expecting a better picture
3,it really depends on your sense of humour.,"This film was pretty good. I liked the humorous aspect to an extent, but it seems like it was over done, considering the seriousness of its predecessor. The Gore I did not mind, and who doesn't love chop chop? The ending could have been better, but I liked the film over all."
4,"""The Saw is Family""","The aspects which made the original ""Massacre"" so incredible included the relenting suspense, dark humor and the terribly frieghtening and unusual atmosphere. That was 1974. Here comes the sequel, the mid 1980's, and fans are in a daze at how different it is. I love it. I must say, my original thoughts when i first viewed this film were not good. i found it offensive, gory and way too different from the original. Then i watched it again with a new perspective and fell in love. This film is meant to be looked at differently. This sequel is supposed to be a parody of the 80's teen flicks/a horror film/and a slapstick humored hillbilly flick. I know it's confusing and seems awful when u read this description, but it is a very fun movie. It's not high in scares, but it is a truly fun, entertaining and wild sequel that takes the series to an unexpected level of insanity and action!"
4,This is why the eighties were so great,"They say the eighties were the decade of excess, well, I say it's the last decade where horror movies didn't totally suck, and TCM2 is a good example of a horror movie that doesn't suck!Pretty much everything is here that a horror fan could want: gore, a pretty damsel in distress, a tortured anti-hero, a chilli contest. I don't know if Tobe Hooper ever talked with Stuart Gordon, but here is a perfect example of Gordon's maxum: More is not enough. And it really isn't, especially in this case. And yet, you get the sense this movie starts exactly where it wants to and finishes exactly where it wants to.The DVD is a little skimpy on the special features, but, dude! C'mon! Ya gotta have it! Dennis Hopper, a hot heroine, a guy with a metal plate who eats the dead skin that forms around its edges, Leatherface, and Grandpa! Plus a pretty cool eights style soundtrack.Return with us hither to yesteryear when horror movies didn't have to suck and popcorn cost only a buck!"
4,Top Texas Massacre Movie,"This is by far the best of all the Texas Chainsaw Massacre films. It loses the cruddy quality and special effects of the first film, thankfully, but retains the sadistic entertainment. The family in this film is the same as the original, and is better than in any of the other movies. There are a handful of good jumps, but what makes this film so entertaining is truly the characters: their complete ignorance of right and wrong, their petty squabbling, and their darkly humorous jokes. Good gore effects and a decent storyline back up the diverting dysfunctional family. A must watch for any horror fan."
3,Sequels are never as good as the original,"I had such high hopes for this movie, but its pretty campy compared to the original. Dennis Hopper was wasted on this movie. I will say that the original Chainsaw Massacre in my opinion is a masterpiece. You can feel the terror. The night scene in the woods, The hook scene, and of course the dinner scene. Classic. There is no better leatherface than Gunnar Hansen. In the original it all seemed plausible that it could happen, that's what made it scary. Part 2 is campy, far fetched, plot holes galore. The new leatherface likes to stand and dance with his saw, and on top of all that, the ending sucks. They should have brought back Edwin Neal (the hitcher). It is worth a look if you are a massacre fan, but if your not you will think this is one of the cheesiest movies ever. R.I.P. Paul Partain (Franklin) and Jim Siedow (the Cook) you will be missed."
4,Not 1,"Well it is certainly differant than the first. With the cheesy dialog and over the top gore, this will make some fans happy, while others will moan about the way it diverges from the path set by the first film. I enjoyed the wildness of the movie, and the always on edge Dennis Hopper. Not much on the dvd as far as extras, and the film and audio are just ok."
4,Dragons Galor!,"A very good book on Dragons. Could have done without the fantasy and had more patterns, but overall full of good ideas. Sparks the imagination and fires the artist in you!"
2,OK I guess,I bought this book for tattooing purposes and it really wasn't all that helpful. Good info on the history and legends of dragons but most of the pictures were pretty cheesy. Works good for general art reference though.
5,Excellent book,"Great illustrations, good work all round. I used the book to design a dragon pattern so I could make a stuffie."
5,Excellent Quality,"Absolutely fantastic, arrival very quick I love the patterns. Very easy to do with the step by step instruction included. The time user can have a great time with this."
5,Excellent charger,This is an excellent charger. The three-hour charger that came with the cordless drill ruined two batteries for me (I guess I am a slow learner) but this one-hour charger does a wonderful job and I do not have to worry about making sure I turned it off.
4,Skil 92991 Charger,This unit charges the 14.4 volt Skil pod type battery and gives an indication when the charging is complete.
2,We have come to expect more from Prof. Gates,"In previous books, Prof. Gates have provided us with much more scholarly works. This book is not up to the standard of being a serious history of the African-American experience. It is poorly organized and replete with errors and omissions. In the past, he has given students and general readers a serious study, such as Africana .... In the past, he has fought against intellectual racism by revealing the facts in serious research. This book does not meet that standard."
1,tough read.,I bought three books dealing with teenagers. Two were easy to read and enlightening on the subject of dealing with teeners. But in this book the material may be in there but it is difficult to plow through and there is no simplified way to extricate and use the info.
1,Socialist and revisionist,I have been teaching history for 20 years and wouldn't touch this book with a ten foot pole. It is sheer propaganda and editorializing. Does the author believe that the American populace is so inept that they cannot make their own conclusions from objectively presented material? I personally find it offensive when authors of history use that platform for their own personal agendas. Zinn would have been better off writng an edtorial for a socialist publication instead.
2,"Polemical, but well written","No citations. This book is very readable, but entirely too revisionist to be truthful. Zinn is more interested in his class perspective than in actually portraying history. There are far better one volume histories out there. If you are a college student taking American History 101, this book should give you the right perspective to get that B or better term paper.An easy prose style does not a great history book make."
1,Insult to my intelligence,"This book will be welcomed by anyone with no real knowledge of the world history, poor critical thinking, and unresolved teenage anger towards their parents (remember how they were always wrong? - now it's the government's turn!). Biased marxist coverage of the american history indicates that the author has no clue about the horrors of living under the real communist regime where his ideals were put to action.I was unlucky to be born and live in the former USSR, before I was able to leave to the US, thanks to the firm anti-communist stand of the former president Reagan and his followers, who brought the Soviet empire down to its knees... As the proud US citizen I would challenge Mr. Zinn to seek an asylim in any of the remaining communist countries (China, Cuba, North Korea, you name it), if he wants anyone to believe that he is a man of integrity."
2,hate western civilization..love this book.!,"No! I am being absurd. Just like howard Z when takes countlesss qoutes from those of minority views in groups and presents them as the majority. Im sure poeple in these groups appreciate being labeled as socialist, or worse, when they are not . Hispanics for instance,(save one or two issues) are more conservcative than you might think. Not that I am hispanic, If only I were, then I wouldnt have to face the guilt of being white, american, and industrius... the most heineous of crimes. Heres what should be included in any history book. ""Congress has not unlimited powers to provide welfare but only those specifically enumerated"" Thomas Jefferson"
1,Left Wing Propoganda,This book isn't so much history with a political bias as it is political propoganda with a loose basis in history.
4,Like it,"So far I like the book, writing style is easy to read. An interesting look at the history I grew up with.600+ pages, it takes good writing to stick with it."
5,Loooooooooooooooooooove it,This book has something in it for everyone. It gives you history from the point of you dont see in textbooks. I recomend this book to ALL my friends family an associates. I encourage you to do the same. They probaly wont keep selling this book as openly as they r. Zinn is a great writter an makes you think about everything not just plain history. Give it to your children they r sure to think above the average. This book was recomened in a movie (Good will Hunting) my advice isBUY IT
4,when this book is good,"this book is only good when paired with traditional history texts or even right-leaning books.this book is by no means impassionate and isn't meant to be. Zinn repeatedly looks at american history through a marxist construction of society. This approach is good because it is different, but is obviously a constrained look at US history.This book shouldn't cause one to formulate their final interpretation of american history. instead, it should inform readers that the US is hardly the romanticized represenative of freedom and prosperity in the world. Instead, US history was mostly formed by people who have been the same for all time, in all places. To see some kind of higher virtue in our government and economy is simplistic and downright wrong.US history is not simple and not black and white. This is the strength and weakness of Zinn's book."
4,"Slanted History, Untold Stories","The concept of following history through the eyes of ""the downtrodden"" is a noble one, and the book does a decent enough job of it while dispelling some of the mythology and disinformation about America's foundations. But Zinn is overly sympathetic to the motives and ideologies of various movements in America, particularly communists and their sympathizers. It's as if he doesn't realize (or more likely, chooses not to) that for many of them the plight of ""the worker"" was so much cover for their own power grab. The book is a counterbalance to more pro-European historical texts but has its own problems with portraying ""reality""."
5,Refreshingly realistic,"I was skeptical when I began this book, but Zinn's extensive research and copious amount of primary source material convinced me that he - like his book - belongs in the highest tier of American literature that every good citizen ought to read. Not only is his fresh account of American history far more convincing than the chest-beating pro-American tales of adventure and prosperity that fill most orthodox historical approaches, but his clear, smooth and engrossing narrative make it a fun and intriguing read.I suspect the real reason that this book has triggered the controversy it has is because some people have serious problems facing the fact that our beloved country has not - and is not - the ultimate guardian of equality, truth and justice it claims to be. The facts are there - read 'em."
4,Reality is perspective.,"Howard Zinn is biased, but what historian isn't? It's impossible to report a historical event without being influenced. At least Zinn is upfront about it. I loved this book- it made me think critically about history in a new way. I don't agree with everything he says, but it helps to have a new point of view."
4,Great book!,"I bought this book because my teacher required us to do so. I am glad that we had to, the book was very informative, and although controversial I loved every bit of it. I am rating it with 4 stars and not 5 because the previous owners name was written in permanent marker along the edges, also it was written and highlighted in. I would like to note that everything was still legible.Overall it was an okay buy, and a great book."
5,History of the U.S. book,"A must for high school, jr. high/middle school students who want a good, solid summary understanding of U.S. history!"
3,Make this comparison,"Compare the first chapter of Zinn's book with the first chapter of ""The Light and the Glory"" by Peter Marshall and David Manuel. What a difference! I suspect Zinn came closer to the truth."
5,An excellent way to expand intelectual horizons,"Over all, a fantastic book. While it certantly does not jive well with everyone's political philosophy (I have already read numerious people call Zinn a pinko, socialist, communist, etc., when in he openly admits he is none of the above), that is the point. It is to expose peolpe to a point of view, and events in history, that they may not have seen before. At these ends, Zinn is 100% successful. What I also admired about the author is that he comes out and admits that his writting very well may be biased, but that is a characteristic intrinsic to writting, having to select which facts to include and which to exclude. I can say that this book should be read by most anyone, expecially those with romantic ideas of ""Old Glory""."
4,a different point of view,"Forget what you have learned about American History. Howard Zinn tries to show you that Traditional History has been told for many centuries by the wealthier, the bigger and more imoportant human beeings. It's a interesting point of view to have the History of America discussed from different perspectives, from the point of view of the excluded by race, religion, genre, social class, color of the skin, educational level , and etc..It's ONE vision not The Vision of Historical Facts and People. This makes History fascinating.The title however is unapropriate. It should be The United States History - an other view. I explain - the facts in this book sometimes were not expressed or reported by the people themselves but for outside observers, interpreting the facts."
5,Great,"I recieved the book ""A People's History of the United States"" in great shape and it was just like new.The book is very interesting, I read it in high school, little did I know I would need it for my college class.Once again the book was in great shape and came in on time.Thank You."
5,Great history review,The CD is great and describes historical events with views from the side lines. It is good to see what else was happening from other angles rather than only the one sided view of the news or what the Government would release.
3,History,I bought this book for my history class. It is very lengthy but easy to read and understand. I did not read all of the book but was interested with the way Zinn presents the history of our country.
2,Biased History as a Goal,"Howard Zinn is a hard left-wing academic historian who believes there is no such thing as ""objective"" history. But he takes this idea further. He argues that historians should not even TRY to write balanced or comprehensive history, but instead they should write a version that supports the political and social values they support. He doesn't care about presenting both sides of a story, leaving it to other historians to tell the other side. In other words, Zinn puts ideology and propoganda over objectivity. He doesn't care if the resulting work is distorted, one-sided or misleading; he argues that if readers want balance they should read somebody else's work and sort things out for themselves. This book is a result of that approach. History of this kind is a lot easier to write, and left-wingers love it. Hence its popularity in undergraduate curriculum."
1,Pure revisionistist history that progressively rejects the founding principles of our nation.,"It's a shame that this is the book most high schools pick to teach our children history. Mr. Zinn is a progressive who would rather forward the liberal agenda than report facts. Our nation was founded on Christian principles endowing man with the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness by our Creator and the government is to secure (not give) those rights. If you love our country, and the founding ideals, then this is the last book I would have your teenager read. This book only further subscribes to the indoctrination that all things are possible through Government, instead, of all things are possbile through hard work, self governance, self reliance, and the Creator's guidance. We are a great nation, filled with God-fearing amazing leaders. You won't get this message from this book."
1,Revisionist history aka Marxist diatribe,My title says it all. If you read this prattle and you have half a brain you will see straight through it. There are so many VERIFIABLE inaccuracies as to be laughable. Read it for laughs only. The scary thing is that some people actually believe this drivel.
1,"Self-righteous leftist ideology, not history","If you are looking for a well-written and comprehensive history of the United States, you won't find it here.If you are a leftist (not liberal, but really leftist) and are looking for reading material to reinforce your view of the world, you might enjoy this."
1,a review,"Although the rest of my AP US history class hates this book, i find that this book is a more appealing way to research ""what really happened"" and not a bunch of lies that have compounded over the centuries and become the ""history"" that we teach the children of the ""best country""in the world."""
1,Tilted!,"When reading history, remember to consider the source. I would urge you to do some research and know a little about this Howard Zinn before reading this book and accepting his version of anything as fact."
1,A Marxist History Of The United State,"Howard Zinn is an American Marxist who embraces all things anti-American. His book is replete with anti- establishment, anti- corporation, anti- white male, anti- patriotic bias. And lest the reader have any question as to his agenda, read the final two chapters in which he openly advocates the overthrow of our current way of life, the forced redistribution of wealth, and in it's place, a new utopian existence based on failed social experiements of the past.This book does not represent a balanced view of American History. It's an entirely negative, depressing view of our nation as seen from a depressed Marxist who looks for the overthrow of our country."
1,Wow.,"Howard Zinn can be a communist if he wants to be, but he has no right to call this book a history, when it really should be called ""Why America sucks and should be a communist country"". Not only that, but he has to be the worst scholar I've ever come across. Footnotes, anyone? Also, if you read all of the five-star reviews, they're liberals calling conservatives biggots and saying that this ""new look"" at history is refreshing. As if they're alone in the world. Take at look at the ratio of five-star reviews to one and two-star review. All alone. Poor liberals. My deepest sympathies to you all."
1,very disappointing,I was very saddened that after Zinn's passing away it was revealed that he was indeed a communist. I cannot give much weight to a book about America that was written by an life long communist. So now I have to read it again and with a skeptical eye knowing that he was a communist and supporter of the communist philosophy that his been responsible for the deaths of more than 130 million people (at least 61 million in the Soviet Union and 70 million in Mao's China alone). I may end up being sorry that I ever read this book.
4,Unpleasant realities of our past come to brutal light.,"Howard Zinn has meticulously cobbled together large swaths of unpleasantness in American history, for which many reviewers here have reviled him. This book is not remarkable because of its relentless pursuit of great atrocities in our past, but because of its accounting of the amazing, inspiring people who fought those atrocities. Howard Zinn reveals the histories of people who were executed, financially ruined, and universally loathed in their own time for their fierce and unstoppable dedication to basic human rights. The United States would not be the great country it is today without these great, uncelebrated people. Thank you, Howard Zinn, for keeping them alive."
5,Howard Zinn a must read,This book is a must read for all Americans. Gives you the people's view of our history. Something they leave out of most history books.
3,Hope to Read it Some Day,The first few pages were very emotionally disturbing. Had to put it back on the shelf. I hope to read it someday.
5,The truth.,"This is a book of truths, cover to cover. It will never be allowed in the public school system where it belongs."
2,Incomplete,"For people who are already very familiar with American history, Zinn provides an interesting alternative view of events. I disagree with many of his premises and most of his conclusions, but he lays out his arguments clearly and provides a starting point for worthwhile debate.That said, I would not recommend this book to someone wanting an overview of American history. Zinn jumps around and fails to provide important background information on many of his subjects. Unless the reader is already very familiar with the events being discussed, they will be misled into accepting one man's rather biased and depressing view of America.Finally, I know this has been mentioned before, but I found the lack of foot-notes and the scantily compiled bibliography rather inadequate for a 'scholarly' book."
5,Essential reading,"Really want to know US history? Then this is mandatory reading to get a broader perspective, more detail, and a sense of the real impact of our story as a nation."
4,3 for history 5 for alternate perspective,"While this book does show some bias, I would say no more than my high school textbooks. Refreshingly, it comes from the other side. An entertaining read, but I would not use it as a serious historical text. It does a good job of showing an alternative perspective on things, but takes it a bit too far in my opinion. Since he does not believe in objectivity, I think he tends to hyperfocus on his own self-acknowledged subjectivity."
3,You gotta be ready,"I had to ""co read"" this with my teenager as it was assigned to him in high-school AP history.Whoa! This was ""one"" way to look at history. Definitely the ""glass half empty"" view of human nature (and our founding fathers).The weird part was it was really readable. It does make you think... but only as a ""counter point"" that may go a ""bit"" too far."
3,A People's History Of the United States: 1492 to Present,"The book traces the oppression of the peoples of North America who were indegenious, brought here through slavery, or poor immigrants by the colonizers, settlors, and later the ""haves"". Today, they are referred to as the ""1%"". To me, the book can be summarized by the belief that history is written by the ""victorious"". It is a harsh but educational recital of the brutality of man. I felt it had a marxist undertone."
1,Pure Leftist America-hating crap.,"It's sad when a supposed ""scholar"" writes a ""history"" of the United States that plays so fast and loose with the facts. Zinn's hatred of his own country could only grow from the Left, where to tear up all that is good and decent is admired. Even more detestable is how he parlayed his hatred into a comfortable life.Don't waste your money on any of Howard Zinn's hate books. There is much better, and honest scholarship out there."
1,"Revisionist History, Populist Pap","The good: It's easy to read. The bad: It's pure revisionist historical pap.The concept of objectivity in historical writing is completely lost on Zinn. Some might find this intertaining, others maddening, yet others still infuriating. The more of this work I read, the less substance I detect. It's junk history, insubstantial, largely fact-less, with no objectivity, basically, a liberal-leaning revisionist perspective of the last few hundred years. Skip it."
1,Such a Waste of time.,"Please do not buy this book. The author is probably making large sums of money for teaching fake history. Although I agree that the 'peoples' side of the story does need to be told, he ignores numerous facts, creates his own facts, and uses misquotes to express and to 'prove' his points. I don't think that college professors should be permitted to profit from lying to their students and readers."
1,Typical Revisionist Screed,"This is just another piece of liberal revisionist screed about how bad America and Americans have been and are. Puke, Puke!"
1,Wow! It was Amazing!,"For all the low-brow types out there: this book blew chunks! Never have I read a more depressing book that takes so many pot-shots at America. Most people are not blind to the truth, not flag flying conservatives that ignore or disregard what is truth.The main challenge that I have with the book is that it is written by a person who lives in a nation that he hates. How in God's name can a person have NOTHTING good to say about America and yet continue to NOT move to a country that embodies the ideals that he wants? Makes me feel sorry for him and glad that I read this book on my own and wasn't required to read it for school."
2,Hopeleslly outdated and baised narrative,"In the entire opus magnum there isn't a single fact cited that may shed any (god forbid!!!) positive light on any of Mr. Zinn's numerous shadow boxing partners, which includes every single one of American Presidents including Washington, JFK and Clinton.Yes, the book cites some interesting and obscure facts which need to be illuminated. But Zinn does it with such a messianic, Rush Limbaugh-like bias as the make the entire thing a hopeless waste of time. Despite trying very hard Zinn is no Lenin, certainly not in the intellectual capacity department."
1,Socialist Propaganda,"Only avowed Socialists would find this propaganda book intellectually honest. If you're in college right now you'll probably run into this book in one of your courses; if so you know your professor is a loon and you're better off dropping the course immediately. If you don't, just remember my admonition. To my leftist detractors: The truth hurts."
4,Good read but very opinionated,"I enjoyed reading this book, however, the other seems to try to pass off his opinion as factual information. There main complaint I have about the book is that the author constantly praises unions and gives them full credit for the laying the groundwork for our society. I recommend pairing this book with ""A Patriots History of the United States."" Read them both, then decide for yourself."
4,Uncomfortable revelations,"I bought this book as a requirement for an adult education (LifeQuest) class being taught by a retired professor of communications.This was my first experience with 'revisionist' history. While it is well written, the reader is faced with having to make an immediate decision as to its validity, because it presents historical views diametrically opposed to those taught in classrooms. I chose to accept it at face value and found its descriptions of our history to be consistent with the realities I had observed through a long life.It may not be comfortable to learn how many of our beliefs about our nation are based more on propaganda labelled as history, but if you value the truth you will find this book revelatory."
5,peoples history,bought as a gift for daughter who is studying to be a history teacher. She was thrilled to receive it because it had been highly recommended to her.
5,Everyone should read this book,I learned about this book from a friend and bought the abridged version she didn't have. Hers was the original version that ended with 1980. I found it to be a compelling read and was even reading it at stoplights. The inclusion of writings from people with first hand accounts is my favorite part. Reading Las Casas' depiction of Columbus and his men's treatment of the Arawaks really solidified the case for me. Depictions of the atrocities of war and the development of unions in America out of necessity were new to my historical teachings. Anyone with a love for history and a mind open to new ideas should read this book. It is not anti-American. It is just the other side of the story. He states clearly in the book that he is trying to tell the story of the conquered people. They need a voice and found one in Howard Zinn.
1,"As a veteran history teacher, I find this book very lacking.","As a veteran history teacher, I found this book to be very lacking. It is very biased and ignores much of history. If you are a progressive, you will love it. If you are looking for real history, I suggestA Patriot's History of the United States: From Columbus's Great Discovery to the War on Terror. It is accurate, better written and is very well sourced."
2,Insightful yet ignorant,"It sounds like such a great idea... Explain the History of the United States with a focus on the ""little guy."" In the end it's pretty typical leftist history. Insightful in its dealing with American imperialism and ignorant when it comes to economics. How anyone who claims to know history can cling to socialist dogma is beyond me. Had Zinn moved past Marx and on to Mises, he might have something more worthwhile to say."
1,One-Side of the Story,"Unfortunately this book is very-one sided. Zinn leaves out crucial events and issues that help to validate his attacks on America. In dealing with the Japanese/Attack on Pearl Harbor, he leaves out extremely crucial information about why the United States was forced to drop the nuclear bombs on Japan. He leaves out the part about the 25 million Chinese who had been relentlessly slaughtered by the Japanese and how Tojo had armed civilians in case a fight between the Allies and Japan would take place on Japanese soil. He blatanly leaves out references to events like the Rape of Naking and the horrible slaughter of American GI's in the Pacific Theatre. Unfortunately, there is so much crucial information left out of this book, that is it absolutely useless as a reference for Amerian History. I am sure however, that Joesph Stalin would find it quite amusing..."
1,Oh well,When History is written (or created) with such a pronounced political agenda it is useless. I had a professor who used this as a supplemental text and viewed Zinn's writing as gospel.
1,A Zero Review,"It is disturbing to know that history has become an interpretative fiction. History should be a record of facts and truth and not a biased report for the ""good of social science."" The author has stated that he has a biased view on his own book. History should be about the truth, no interpretation, no lies or point of views. Just the facts, ma'am. If we start giving our biased report in history, then we are lost. We will not report what does not serve that purpose. Quite disturbing. To quote Zinn in his own book -in the final chapter: ""This makes it a biased account, one that leans in a certain direction."" Give this NO history book a pass. It is interpretation of fiction and no history book."
1,Great Reading for Socialists....Not so good for everyone else.,"Some interesting takes on various issues over the past four centuries. Nothing actual students of history have probably missed. This work is easily summed up in a few words: White men are evil, progress is evil, and finally Capitalism is EVIL!!! If you want to actually read some good history which is informative and interesting (unlike modern history textbooks), do a little research, there is plenty out there without the extreme bias and agenda found in these pages."
1,"Well, I Liked It At First","This is an absolutely fabulously informative book and I would highly recommend it to any self-loathing person of European descent who wants to hear outrageously biased tales of how our forefathers and theirs before them needlessly raped, pilaged and exploited the incredibly civilized, admirable and just populations of the world. Well Mr. Zinn, I'm glad you came along with your admiration and love for communal primitive society and your hatred for your own people and their history because now I know for a fact that self-hating white abolitionists do exist. Gee, if it wasn't for our horendously wicked people, the world would probably be the perfect utopian society right now ....... like those of the Aztecs, Somalians, Liberians, and Mayans. Don't ya think? Thanks!!!"
1,Big Bucks for Opinionated Fiction,"This book is opinionated fiction. Zinn portrays religion, Christianity in particular- as a tool of the oppressors to maintain their power and that ""control of women"" by means of the family was an ""ingeniously effective"" device of oppression... That marriage enchained, and children doubled the chains. What is this!? The saddest part of all, is that this book is being presented in our nations colleges as history ""higher learning"". People are paying big bucks to learn this garbage.Zinn has many public speaking engagements... for all his complaining about the oppressive, wealthy elite, isn't it interesting to note that his fee range is $5001-$10,000 per speaking engagement?"
1,Zinn -- Just Say NO,"Don't waste your money on Howard Zinn's hysterical historical fantasy. This book should not be taken seriously. In fact, it's hardly worth writing a review except to warn people not to fall for his anti-American, anti-capitalism diabtriabe as he merrily deposits his big bucks in one of those evil financial institutions.Want a good read on American history? Buy ""A Patriot's History of the United States"" by Schweikart and Allen. Written with a sense of humor and more important with a sense of history."
1,INSANITY,"Howard Zinn sounds a bit like my sister when she returned from getting ""educated"" at UC Berkeley. INSANE."
4,A People's History of the United States: 1492 to Present,"I like it (I am still reading it) I can devote only 30 minutes per day to pleasure reading. The title could lead some to believe that all the important events in U.S. history are covered in this one book. Of course, they are not."
5,An Uplifting History,"Critics of this book must think of history the same way Henry Kissinger does. He calls it ""the memory of states"". But Professor Howard Zinn clearly shows us that history belongs to the PEOPLE and not the states that rule them. Yes, it might be hard to swallow when most of us have been taught that great things happen due to the eternal wisdom and strength of our national leaders and poweful institutions. Thankfully, Zinn shows us quite the opposite. Time and time again it is the struggle of ordinary people, carried forward with great courage and dignity, that lead to history's greatest moments. To me, this is a very optimistic, uplifting account of our country's past. This book shows the historical dangers of un-checked power and illegitimate authority and what is possible when people act bravely to resist it."
4,Fascinating perspective - perfect for a winter road trip,"This book presents a decidedly bottom-up perspective on American history, and it'll make you question the motivations and hidden messages behind everything you learned in school. Zinn's book is particularly suited to book-on-tape - it's got a lot of detail, but the writing is clear and concise. You might be surprised at how great of a reader Matt Damon is! He brings just enough character to the voices of the primary sources. If you have a long road trip coming up, I would recommend this book to spark deep political thought and conversation."
5,Should join the Gideon Bible in the other hotel room drawer,"Howard Zinn lays it on the line, and tells us the history that our teachers did not (would not, or could not) teach us. Its a long read, but its not meant to be entertaining. This is NOT WRITTEN FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE WINNERS, so be prepared. What else can I say? Buy it and keep it on your shelf."
3,A People's History of the United States,"Howard makes his point of view very clear. He is a leftist and a populist. One serious downside to the book is that Howard seems not mention progress much. He focuses on things that were/are bad and unjust and rarely mentions or focuses on the many great American achievements.On the upside there is alot of information about things that are not included in your ""hooray America"" history books. There is alot of good material about discrimination that other historians seem sweep under the rug.This by no means is an objective book and should by no means be your only source for American history, nevertheless, it is a decent read. I gave it 3 stars because there were instances throughout the book in which Howard takes on a pretty heavy indoctrinating tone. I it found to be a bit much at times."
2,More fiction than fact,"I was really hoping for new information and another perspective on history, but was seriously disappointed. Some of the information that I found enlightening in the early chapters, I questioned by the time i reached near the end of the book. The statistics are used misleadingly and to make connections between unrelated events. (I found errors is his history of Lincoln, Native Americans, and (most commonly) modern economics).I don't think that this is intentional. The author appears to domatically believe in cetain points of view and looks for connections whether they exist or not leaving him as credible as Rush Limbaugh just on the other end of the spectrum."
1,Biased book,"This book should only be read if one is also reading a book with a more balanced perspective of American History. Zinn ignores way too many facts from American history and will leave the reader with a distorted view of the past. If one is comfortable having a half true view of history, by all means read this book and ignore all others."
2,"Good book, but not so good version","For kindle version, if there is no page number available from kindle app, not sure how would the students follow the teacher's instruction for the assignments."
4,Mystery...,"This was a good book, I recomend it. If you like thrillers and mysteries this is a good book."
4,works great and it's lighter,Like the other HD77 but it's lighter. The only thing is I didn't care much for the twist lock connection that this saw came with. I wouldn't have bought it if I knew it came with it. Had to change the chord to a regular one for convenience.
1,JUNK!,"This was the biggest waste of money I've ever spent. The trigger didn't work unless you tap on the front of the blue foam piece (not the side that contacts the drum head)and even then it only triggered when it wanted to. Also the wires became disconnected about a month after I got it, now I understand why it only cost $25.00"
1,Stopped working after 5 gigs.,"Hey, I just wanted to say that it worked great for about 4 gigs and it fried on the fifth gig. it just stopped sensing. if i hit the sensor in the corner it would pick up but no where else. Lousy trigger. at least the one I had. Very disappointed . It blows..."
4,Gil Shaham,"This was an exceptionally good recording, but I'll have to admit Joshua Bell's recording is better..."
5,Ponce wheel,"Along with the help of carbon paper, this is an indespensable tool for laying out boat plans directly onto the material to be cut, ie; marine plywood, structural parts, etc."
5,Amazing,"Jim Marion writes from experience. Not only is this book truly inspiring but it also serves as a guide on how you can experience your true nature, beyond words, beyond labels, beyond concepts. To truly experience and know yourself is to let go of everything and come into contact with the True Nature of everything, call it God if you'd like. A truly amazing work that I recommend to all Christian and non-Christian friends."
5,A fine new edition of a pioneering novel,"Ever since Paul O'Keeffe published his edition of the 1918 version (Black Sparrow Press, 1996) of Wyndham Lewis's novel 'Tarr' the scholarly community has been in need of a scholarly edition of Lewis's 1928 rewrite of the same novel.Scott Klein's edition for OUP's World's Classics series answers that demand in fine style. An extensive and illuminating editorial introduction frames what is a comprehensively annotated and explicated version of a text that to date has only been available as an unedited Penguin text (besides its original publication by Chatto and Windus).Without doubt required reading for Lewis enthusiasts, but more importantly, as Klein suggests here, for general readers too. By reading one of Lewis's most experimental contributions to the novel form, new and old Lewisians alike necessarily will gain a greater understanding of the modernist novel as a whole."
1,Blades didn't have contact along edges,"Couldn't cut a hair, the scissors would just fold the hair between them. They didn't have contact between them, if you held up vertically you could see through between them. I bought to trim an occasional tangle or split end & they may have a sharp edge but for scissors they didn't do it."
1,Disgusting,"This movie was disgusting, I almost threw up in during several scenes. The implication that one of main characters actions as a rapist and a stalker as love makes me sick."
1,Disgusting,This movie was disgusting. Made me want to throw up. Sick....This was my first AND LAST Almodovar film. Excuse me while I go throw up again.
3,An elephant sized dump....,yea! The whole chain of events was too farfetched to really pull you in but a decent movie nonetheless...
1,I love Almodovar but...,"Typically, I enjoy Almodovar movies very much. I have been a fan since the 80s with Women on the Verge, Labyrinth of Passion, etc. However, I found Talk to Her disturbing, and not in a good way. Almodovar is usually provocative and interrogates social and cultural assumptions to good end. In this case, he misses the mark."
2,Just very peculiar,I just couldn't relate to this movie at all. It was a very dark movie that didn't leave a message for me.
2,Boring?,"Acting was fine, even notable. However the story, thoughnot quite total drivel, just seemed to me to be not worth telling. The film was nice as a vehicle for the actors. There was also good camera work. I assume everyone got paid, so good for all. For us though, there are finer stories out there; plausible ones, indeed interesting ones. This story would not be one of those."
1,horrifying,"This film condones the rape and consequent impregnation of a comatose woman. If you would like some more insight into the objectification of women, watch ""Crumb."""
2,Yet another film,"that manages to self-destruct. Again, like many of Almodovar's movies,we start out with a fascinating premise, very nice camera work and a decent cast. Then the whole thing quickly takes a sharp turn into bizzaroland and never comes back. And the viewer stops caring. While there's certainly nothing at ALL wrong with artistic and/or deep films, they still, due to the medium, have to be accessible. Habla con Ella is not. Yes the theme is apparent to anyone with a working brain, but that doesn't make it easier to watch. Movies shouldn't ever be so much work unless they're intended for a severely limited audience."
1,Talk to Her (Hable con Ella),"I really wanted to love this movie. The cinematography was beautiful and I tried hard to sympathize with the protagonists presented by Almodovar. But ultimately I found it impossible to identify with a rapist. This movie is yet another example of rape and other violence against women is normalized and eroticised in film. It's really very simple and the complex statement about how love crosses boundaries, is false. A man having sex with a woman who is not able to consent, because she is in a coma, is disgusting and makes me very angry."
1,ALMODOVAR's WORST!!!,"The only reason this movie gets one star is because it is its lowest rating. I am a HUGE Almodovar fan and I find that this is his WORST MOVIE EVER! It's only saving grace is the small silent movie that is completely out of place in this hideously bad film. I found the acting to be very poor. I cannot understand for the life of me how this movie won two Oscars. If you want to see a truly unique Almodovar film rent ""Matador"" or ""Live Flesh"". Even ""Kika"" is far superior to this piece of trash. Don't waste your money on this garbage."
2,2.5 stars for this entertaining and divisive film,"It seems that people are of two minds about this film; either they think it was offensive (""glorifies rape""), or they think it was one of Almodovar's best films (part of his ""mature stage""). I will offer a third view: like all of Almodovar's films, it's entertaining but ultimately trivial; not even worth the fuss of such serious discussion.Habla con Ella certainly marks Almodovar's ""mature"" stage, in the sense that the music and themes are more serious and less neurotic or whimsical, and the production value looks to be at an all-time high for his films. Perhaps this is because he recently turned 60. But despite this, his consistent trademark is still maintained here: the film is very entertaining yet never displays any poignancy that could elevate it to classic status."
4,SO DIFFERENT,"When I went to see this film I knew that many people in Europe like it already. It took almost all awards in Europe. I knew the director and some of the actors. I knew the exceptional work these people had done before but I did not really know what level of a film I would see now. It was different. It was different even from the early works of the same people. There was no moving picture in this film. This was a very well done play where the movie approach was used just to move people from one scene to another and from one area to another. The cinematography, as we know it, was not really applied or important. It is a great play which was put together by the great group of people. I enjoyed it very much."
5,Career management,"Exactly the book I needed. Relevant, up to date, and valuable insights into the class I needed it for in my master's program."
5,Riding Motorcycles Through Space,"Definately a solid four and a half stars for this EP (so between me and the other reviewer that's what it will be). ""Kids"", ""Indie Rokkers"" and ""Time To Pretend"" are my favorites. If you enjoyed MGMT's Oracular Spectacular then you'll love this EP. I've actually enjoyed the EP more. If you haven't had a chance to check out Oracular Spectacular then what can I say except you're missing out on some of the best psychedelic indie rock that's ever been made. If you don't get a chance to pick that one up let me at least encourage you to get the song ""Electric Feel"" from the Oracular Spectacular album. I saw the video for ""Electric Feel"" on youtube and fell in love with the band. Watch it and you'll find out why and the meaning behind my title to this review.I'm not sure why amazon doesn't post the track listings to certain albums... so here ya go.1. Time to Pretend2. Boogie Down3. Destrokk4. Love Always Remains5. Indie Rokkers6. Kids"
4,Good inexpensice level for around the house,This is a nothing special level yet a good addition to the collection. This size works well for around the house projects like leveling that shelf or picture. It is too small for many of your larger products but that is not what you should be getting this for. As long as your don't have tall expectations this level will serve you well.
3,Vegas Changes Almost Daily,This book is good for my intended purpose of seeing what to expect on my planned road trip from Las Vegas to the Grand Canyon. However the information on Las Vegas is noticeably dated.
2,Copy of a copy of a copy from a VCR,"Well, I received my copy. And - while I recognize the title is hard to find - I was a little disappointed with the quality. The recording looks like a VCR tape of a TV broadcast that has been transferred to DVD.Again, I recognize that the title is hard to find or impossible to find. So I accept that this was the best they could do. I just want other buyers to know that this isn't going to look great on your TV."
3,Pretty good vigilante movie.,"A homicidal maniac is on the loose, killing motorists at random in his ""death car"" - after losing his brother to the twisted assassin ""Skull"", Rick Benten becomes a vigilante, and takes it upon himself to hunt down the reckless drivers that fill the streets at night. Being a master mechanic, Rick spends his time converting his pickup truck into an armed and dangerous vehicle - with speed to take on the fastest car, and strength to make sure in a one-on-one situation, he will be the only survivor. The cops soon find out about the vigilante known only as the ""Gladiator"" and do all they can to catch him before his citizen's arrests go one step too far - but will they find the Gladiator before the Gladiator finds Skull? When the two finally meet, it's a duel to the death and maybe an end to Rick's career as the vigilante."
3,"okay movie, poor quality recording","I saw this movie many years ago and as I find is often the case when watching movies years later, they don't quite measure up to what I remembered. Still a good movie though, however the quality was horrible as one other person said. The picture is grainy like the product of several generations of analog copies. The sound is slightly out of sync with the video and the volume is a little low but when you turn it up you hear a loud hum.I'm sure it doesn't pay to go back and professionally remake every ""B"" movie made over the last 50 years because there isn't enough market demand to justify the cost involved. However if you're just wanting to fill in the blanks to see how much you remember and clear up the fuzzy spots then this is adequate. There are a lot of movies I saw back in the day that I'd like to see again on DVD if the quality was at least equal to this (preferably better) and the price was reasonable."
1,??????,"What's the Rite of Spring without intensity? [Garbage]..., that's what. This recording of The Rite is the worst I've ever heard; I was thoroughly dissapointed. The playing of the Berlin Philharmonic isn't BAD (through most of the piece, but there were a couple of parts where i just dropped my jaw at how pathetic it was. Wrong rythms, poor ensemble, etc.), but they DO NOT do this brilliant, savage piece of music justice. Karajan's interpretation is bland and uninteresting, it sounds like he and his orchestra are going through the motions, at best. If you want to hear how this piece is supposed to sound, with fire, passion, and a superb, balanced, POWERFUL orchestra, go to Ozawa and Chicago."
4,Biking with a Dark Side,"Thoroughly enjoyed the book, highly recommend it. Of the cycling books I've read, this one has more of a dark side than any of the others. I don't know, or suggest, that that's a bad thing. Maybe this author is just more willing to talk about the negative side of his adventure. It's also true that while cycling is central to this book, in some sense it's irrelevant. I see this as the story of the author's completely changing his life style, and biking to the lower 48 sort of gave him something to do while in the process. Like to meet the author, though."
4,Summit County Reader,"You don't have to ride bikes to benefit from this book. For those of us who have considered leaving our cocoons but haven't had the nerve, Mr. Lowrance gives candid commentary on the ups and downs of confronting our demons while offering colorful descriptions of the journey that opens up the opportunities to explore the inner self. This book will help open doors to experiences we've only dreamed of."
4,"As good as the original, better in some ways","Black and White 2 isn't the same game B&W; was, and in many good ways. First piece of advice if you loved the original; pay attention to the tutorial on ""how to move."" They've changed some of the navigational details.The toolbar is a welcome addition, letting you find what you need quickly--use it--and the ability to accumulate ""Tribute"" and redeem it for various new buildings and tools feels familiar to players of other strategy games.B&W2; does more of a job of incorporating the elements of a strategy game with an RPG, and if you like battles you'll get that here in a way the original did not satisfy.The graphics are beautiful, the devil and angel either annoying or cute, depending on how you felt about them before, and the citizens fun to manipulate and help you feel godlike. City-building is more interesting with roads and rewards for doing it well."
4,"very good with, some flaws","this game is one of the best games I have ever played, but there are flawspros:open ended,very good graphics,fun,awe inspiring creature that changes as it grows,multiple creatures,fairly easy,cons:glitches (few),enemy miracles,after you beat it once you are stuck with your original character (just me?)four stars****"
4,"Yay, fun!","A really good, entertaining game--I spend hours on it and lose track of the time. I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for hours of pleasing entertainment!"
5,Phenomenal!,"This game is too good to be true! The versatility of it is mind boggling!My ONLY complaint is that the final level is very very difficult. But hey, a good challenge makes a game worth playing, right?? And I was still able to manage to beat it after several tries. So I guess it wasn't TOO hard.Highly highly recommended!"
1,this game sucks,"nothing more really needs to be said.I'm running a 3GHz P4;256Mb ATI Radeon 9000 series PCI express video card and 2Gb of RAM and the game still hangs,lags and locks up on my computer. I tried uninstalling & reinstalling-same effect.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME"
1,Well..,"This game didn't really impress me. It could have been a lot better if the designers would have the patience. The graphics are good, but the gameplay is no fun. If you want a strategy game, don't buy this."
4,Great Sevice!,"The Game came in excellent condition, and i am surprised it managed to reach my house so fast. I will definantely use your services again for my next purchase.Thank you."
4,b&w review,"great game, I highly belive on buying games when they are 1 or 2 years old, the reasom I say that is because most all developers let the game out way to early before the game is all worked out and bugs are fixed bugs which are fixed throught patches, if game developers really want to sell a good game make one with all bugs worked out, this game has not flaws that I found, well made game, fun to play. but always down load a demo before buying, thats what i have been doing for years and in all my games, i dont have any games that i regret buying."
3,Don't know,"I bought it, couldn't play it on Windows XP. Graphics Card not good enough. Still haven't been able to play it."
2,Boring,At First is cool to play with it but then it get anoying because yout people are always hungry and then they will say that you are a bad god i just dont like it
3,black & white 2,its an interesting stratergy game but there are several things i hate in the controls and the ai is not as good as some games i have played
5,b&w,the game was in perfect shape no scuffs or scratches one of my favorite games thanks very much for the great game
2,fun game.. s*** quality copy.,"The two stars are for the game itself. Such an amazing game and really set the bar for ""god gaming"". But the copy I received (even after paying the extra money to buy it from an ""Amazon Approved"" source) was of DISMAL quality. So many scratches on the game I'm surprised it works, though luckily I've not had any problems yet, and the game case was practically shattered. None of the disks stay put in the case they just slide around, which contributes to more scratching."
3,Good game but aspects that made the first game a step above the rest have been removed,If you played and liked the first one that dosnt meen that you will like this one. What made the first one stick out to me was the fantastic creature handling the game allowed. The second one removed alot of the creature things that made it so appealing in the first place. For instants the big creature battles you coold zoom in on and tell your creature what to do exactly. Besides things like that being removed the game feels like another plain RTS like all the rest. Thats why I didnt really warm to this sequal like I did the first one. The first one was made longer ago but the execution was far better than the second. They left the guide lines from the first one behind. Overall I was dissapointed with Lion Head for this but if you like RTS's with a few neat little perks then you will probably like this.
2,"Repetitive, boring","The overall impression is that of a game made on the rush.Assuming the ""good"" alignment, you win simply by building expensive buildings at the edge of your influence zone and burning the enemy's platoons sent by a very unintelligent AI. Since winning requires no strategy, the game isn't challenging; you can do basically the same on all levels.The races against which one fights are pretty much the same except for their ""skins"" and the building's aspect. Defeating them all takes you at most 8 hours of gameplay.Unlike the previous version of B&W;, there are no custom campaigns nor multiplayer features. Cinematics and creature apart, it looks like a very primitive first version of ""Age of Empires""."
4,Better than the 1st one,Everything in this game is very improved over the 1st one. The game is a ton of fun but doesn't have much lasting appeal. I found myself playing it for a couple of weeks then haven't touched it since (it's been about 3 years).
4,good game,"this was bought because it was told to be able to push my graphics card to it's limits , a great game but my GPU was able to render it flawlessly"
4,great game,"Although it is a bit older, I really enjoyed playing it. It came as advertised and I am very satisfied with the seller and purchase."
5,Great Game,"I love this game, it's really well thought out. Thanks for making such a great game for people like me."
2,Too Much Hype,"I bought this game the day it came. I was expecting it to be really awesome. Yes the graphics are more intense but that's mainly it. There's tons of bugs not even the patch fixes all of it. The AI will taunt you with the same lines until you conquer him or win him over. In the last mission my influence ring would not expand beyond my walls so I was stuck without soldiers, barely any walls, and barely able to survive the first waves. I eventually gave up and uninstalled the game."
2,Tedium at a new level,"The graphics are outstanding but in reading the forums you do need an outstanding computer set-up to enjoy...my ran beautifully graphic-wise on a 6800 GT video card.But....I could only play thru the 4th level, the ever-constant clicking on things, trying to move around and resource gathering, troop building made it sooooo tedious I had to uninstall it rather than waste my precious free time.The first BW was much better."
2,Requirements inaccurate,Just a warning: The requirements listed on the box are not accurate. You'll need to have a significantly faster computer than is stated to play the game at more than 10 frames per second.
5,"excellant book, easy to follow if you were in nam",this book will hold your attention page by page. If you have read any of the other LRRP books you will find that they are all pretty much the same: entertaining!
5,Recondo !!!,"Very good account of life in Recondo. The walk through the Vietnam service portrayed in this book, will keep you in the moment."
3,A right moment can never truly be re-created,"To watch this movie, one really has to be patient. It moves slowly and if not for the occasional moments of humor it would have been a real drag. This film has an idea of what it is to catch a right moment when two people can connect and be intimate. Surely one would think that these are adults that can handle any situation but these thirty somethings are worse than teenagers. The outward impression of them is never matching with what is going on inside of them. Deep inside they are either too damaged, or too childlish to handle their own emotions and decisions. One almost feels like wanting to smack them so they can snap out of it. In any case the appearances are never what the reality is. And that is what movie is all about. Couple is not really a couple. Well meaning stranger is not always a well meaning stranger seeking to strike a new friendship. And seemingly dog loving couple is anything but..."
1,Had to fastforward through the boring and other parts....,"Please read the other reviews... I found them more interesting than watching the movie. The only reason I gave it 2 stars versus one is because the filmmaker does make interesting points about life and idiotic relationships. He does touch on real human weaknesses and expose them, and maybe that was why it was painful for me to watch some of it? I really disliked the main male protagonist... the Director. Yes, he was damaged, but why inflict it on other damaged souls? I feel he was using the women to cure his writers block. I wished the women would've turned around and run from him.. immediately... and kept their dignity. The ending was also unexpected... unpredictable... abrupt, but gave me some hope. OK, so you can get stuck in life, but with a little help you can get out. Maybe this film is a cautionary tale?"
5,One of the best graphic novels out there,"Reading a new collection of ""Powers"" stories is like when a new season of ""The Sopranos"" comes out on DVD... It's so good, so well-written and so well-paced... and it flies by so damn fast! I zoomed through this book in a day, and was so bummed when it was done... Can't wait for the next book to come out.""Powers"" is a cop's-eye view of the world of superheros and supervillains; sure, they can zap the city into rubble, but somebody has to clean up the mess... and file the paperwork. In this volume, Det. Deena Pilgrim grapples with her newly developed superpowers... which, so far, only she knows about. Some more history about the super-community, and Deena's introduction to the police force. But where that is all heading seems very much up in the air right now! If you've been following the story this far, you'll be on the edge of your seat all the way through this one. Another winner from Bendis and Oeming. [2006 joesixpack at slipcue dot com]"
4,There is no other comic-book like Powers,"I do like almost every comic Bendis has writen, but for sure this is the most complex and the best joining superhero fiction with detective stories. By reading just the first you are bound to read the every single one and wait eagering the next issue.There is other like Powers"
3,Good but not essential,"Powers as a series waned pretty fast. Just couldn't maintain the momentum. Bit of a lost opportunity. Then again, maybe there just wasn't all that much life in the concept."
5,Great Intro to Meditation!!,"If you have any desire to learn about or practice meditation,you couldn't find a better resourse."
2,"This was the book I ordered ,acccording to the title, but not the right one.",This was not the book I thought I was ordering as there are two books the same title but different authors. Recommend you make sure you have the right author. Great book I suppose if you are a Budhist.. Great price though!
2,Nice message,"It is a nice book with a nice message. However, I can't say there was much new than Seeker 101 might have already guessed. I was hoping for a little more from this book. Basically, a pretty neutral rating depending on the message you need to get right now. Good luck."
3,Pay attention,"The theme of mindfulness is to pay attention to your emotions, your body, your mind and your surroundings. The concept is intruiguing but the self help suggestions in this book fall short in some areas. Add this book to your ""maybe' list."
5,full of truth,the guys got a way of seeing life in a waymost people never see it.gives you a real understandingof how to slow down and live here and now and let the future take care of itself
3,Like many other books,"I honestly don't understand why this book is a best-seller. It contains the same information that you find in many other books on meditation or mindfulness. It tells you about meditation in different traditions, such as Buddhism or Yoga, and distinguishes meditation from those traditions, emphasizing its benefits. The author, however, offers very superficial recommendations on how readers can make meditation useful in their lives. If you're like me and want something you can use, then read the book Secret Techniques for Controlling Sadness, Anger, Fear, Anxiety, and Other Emotions by Vlad Koros. While Koros doesn't talk about meditation per se, his book focuses on the somatic experiences (description of which is amazingly nuanced and precise) that you feel during meditation and on specific techniques for regulation of those experiences. Secret Techniques, unlike Wherever You Go, There You Are, is very practical and both of these books are fun to read."
4,Solid introduction to Meditation Practices,"This book was recommended to me by a Sociology professor as a practical guide to exploring stress management techniques. I found it to be an interesting and basically useful introduction to Meditation Techniques and especially appreciated its inclusive, light-handed approach to encompassing more than just Buddhism when promoting the spiritual benefits of meditation.There is certainly something to be gained from this book, whether it is life-changing ""mindfulness meditation"" or simply a new approach to self-awareness and the pursuit of peace."
5,Excellent classic.,"Zinn continues to touch the lives of individuals who are fortunate enough to encounter his work. I originally became familiar with this work years ago, but in my several moves, I had lost my copy of Wherever You Go, There You Are. Not only had I lost this work, but I had gotten away from my mindfulness journey. I am now back on track with this excellent classic.Wherever You Go, There You Are (ROUGH CUT)"
2,"Wherever You Go, There You Are",A great program to take. Book came across more like a self proclaiming story about the author and not the topic at hand. Not a keeper.
2,"Wherever You Go, There You Are","I didn't have a real good experience with this book.I found the writing to be very boring, babbling, and without substance.I have a hard time believing how and why this book got so many good reviews.One review stated how it saved their life.If that review proves not to be staged, I am going to start selling magical rocks!My advice is save your money on this mambo jumbo and bad printing.Check out the great books by Bhante G. and Thich Nhat Hanh if interested in mindfulness."
3,"Book is Awesome, Bookseller messed up","The Book by Jon Kabat-Zinn is phenomenal, I'd recommend to everyone! My complaint is with the bookseller who shipped me a soft cover book. I specifically searched for a hard back copy and paid the extra amount. I was extremely dissapointed with this, and hope it isn't indicative of this bookseller."
2,HOw many ways can someone repeat what has been none already,"I found this book to be very dissapointing. I forced myself to read 3/4 of it. If you want to get useful info.. Put up a book on buddism or yoga meditation. I found nothing special about this book. I read a lot of books on meditation, yoga, and buddism, and this book doesn't hold up to any of them. I read the reviews on this site and ran out to buy this book. After forcing myself to read it I finally had enough. I definately don't want this book to be in my libary."
3,ok book not really a manual on meditation,"I feel like the authors heart is in the right place, but as a book on mindfulness and in particular meditation, it is over wordy with lot of new age generalities. For example, one tip for meditation is to think that you are a mountain. this is fine, but this is what this book is not necessarily a manual for meditation and how to handle the difficulties of meditation. If you're expecting a book that is predominantly a new age thinking book (i.e. imagine you're a lake, tons of quotes from chinese philosphers, thoreau) then this is the book for you. If you're expecting a manual on mindfulness then this is not the book for you. there other books out there that cover that.I recommend reading the preview. I read the preview but wasn't sure about the book but still purchased it because of all the 5 star reviews. I regret it, so if after reading the preview you feel the same way, save yourself some cash and look for a different book."
4,good book,"I liked Wherever You Go for its clarity. The book tries to make mindfulness practical, but it still remains largely philosophical. I bought it along with few more books on mindfulness. The most in-depth guide to meditation and how to use it in every-day life was Secret Techniques for Controlling Sadness, Anger, Fear, Anxiety, and Other Emotions, which says nothing about the meditation or its background. But Wherever You Go helps to understand where Secret Techniques come from. I highly recommend both these books."
4,New language,"East reading and gives new inspiration to ""stick with it."" This book motivated my never-ending sporadic attempts to ""just do it."""
4,Great book but don't buy the Mindfulness Meditation cd's,"I came upon this book by accident and it was the title that drew me to it. Absolutely enjoyed the book from beginning to end. It's something you can keep by your bedside, read a chapter (3-4 pages) and take in a little at a time. In our fast paced world this is just what the doctor ordered to listen to your inner voice. My once advice is DO NOT order the mediation cd's at the end of the book. These are possibly the worst meditation cd's I've ever listened to. Stay with the book and enjoy"
5,Powerful meditation techniques,"These techniques proved of much more value to me after reading Conversations with God and An Encounter With A Prophet. Having removed all of my unconscious fears of the spiritual world I could go into a much deeper, peaceful and meaningul meditative state."
2,WAY too complicated,"this is way too many CD's and not good for a beginner. It was a waste of money. If you have too much time on your hands, this may work for you but being a mother, I don't have even close enough time to incorporate into my life."
1,Fits great under the coffee table leg,"it's easy to meditate when the book puts you to sleep. oh yeah, don't forget to send more money for the tapes. must be so you can tape your eyes open while reading it."
4,Classic manual on meditation,"People consider this book a contemporary classic on meditation for good reasons. It's lovely and accessible. Jon Kabat-Zinn tackles the difficult task of explaining the nonverbal practice of meditation, which many find alien or even threatening, and makes it accessible, useful and even homey. He explains meditation not only with references to classic texts, but also by recounting his own experiences, drawing parallels with Thoreau, and discussing work and family contexts. The chapters are brief, some as short as a page, each focusing on a single topic. Many are accompanied with prompting questions or simple exercises you can try immediately. getAbstract recommends this book to people interested in reducing their stress, deepening their self-awareness and sharpening their focus."
