3,Title story is compelling; all three are depressing.,"This book contains three short stories, each of them about a ""Woman Destroyed."" Two are utterly depressing, and one is incoherent. The middle story was stream of consciousness babbling by a mad woman character, and I couldn't even finish it. The first story was depressing, and compelling enough to finish. The third story, the title story, was very compelling, defintely a page-turner, but also depressing.This third story, A Woman Destroyed,"" tells the tale of a woman whose children have left home, and she experiences empty nest syndrome, only to find out her husband has been having an affair for years, while discouraging her from seeking emplyment and encouraging her to put all her focus into the children and home. He is a real rat, but yet you can see that he is truly torn, taht he thinks he is somehow protecting his wife, while he is ultimately destroying her. The most compelling aspect is the wife her self, watching her slow demise."
4,cool,"This is a really cool 80's space anime. Though my only complaint is that they changed the music in the dub version. My favorite episode on this disc is the Halloween one, for i thought it was the most funny. Not to mention that one of my friend's little sister is really into this series."
5,Anime is japaneese for fun,"Anime is japanese for fun, so that is the spirit in which we should take films like this. It is the original girl power movie. the girls have a good off again on again relationship that keeps sanity in bikins amid all of the craziness."
1,"Great Photos, Poor Content","This is a fantastic source of images on the subject of fractals, but not a great source of learning. Most books on math and science are difficult for the general reader; few authors (like Isaac Asimov) can make complex things easily understood. But the author of this book is, in my opinion, doing the public a disservice by oversimplifying the subject. The explanations underestimate the public's ability to think, and even include a number of things which are either dead wrong or made-up! The subject of fractals is still new, and there are recently more books available to explain fractals to the general public. Again, this is a great source of images, if that's what you're looking for, but look for another source if you want to undersatnd and appreciate this incredible and important topic."
1,Don't buy this book,"This book says absolutely nothing. It has a few good pictures (the best one is one the cover by the way), but the text is utterly worthless and uninformative. My favorite quote from the book is ""Nonlinear means not linear."" Really? Don't waste your money. Now I understand why I found it at the used bookstore."
5,Patterns to Inspire - A Captivating Look into Fractals,"This book brings a comprehensive and visually intriguing approach to the study of fractal geometry and the chaos theory. Through thought provoking imagery and discernible explanations & comparisons, John Briggs has sparked my curiosity where I now look more closely at the world around me. I believe this book is intended to captivate those with the ability to visualize and appreciate the aesthetics and interconnectedness of the arts, sciences and the natural phenomena that surrounds us. An insightful & visually stimulating read!"
3,OK,This book was OK---but it had more fractals in nature and not so much in the way of computer-generated fractal art which is what I was looking for. Not bad if you can find it used.
4,Great backless bra.,"I looked all over and finally found this! very comfortable and the strap in front doesn't dig into your tummy (in a very unflattering way) the way the others do. However, the back strap doesn't go as far down as I hoped, but I don't know that any of the other brands do."
3,Painful and uncomfortable,"It hurt like crazy round the front with the strap, and it felt loose on the shoulders, but it is low enough so if your willing too suffer the pain it works perfectly for low cut tops. Maybe if your super skinny and have smaller breasts it wouldn't hurt so much."
2,"Not worth the cost, but acceptable","This is no better than a regular $30 bra from Macy's. I never tried clear straps before, and I found them to be too visible, so I ended up wearing a strapless bra with my dress. The straps also didn't stay adjusted properly - the clear straps just didn't have the right friction and the length adjustment would slide as I wore it. It is a relatively comfortable bra, but I have no idea what the belly strap is supposed to do. I have other bra's that fit just like this one with no stomach strap. It doesn't seem to hold the bra in place any better than any other bra's straps. I read from the other reviewer that the cup size runs small and it is true - I am a D and so I ordered a DD and it fit correctly for a D."
2,Sound is distorted,"I installed this unit to control a set of Yamaha outdoor speakers, which I had been using for about 6 months with no issues. For whatever reason, everything works fine at first, then after 30 minutes or so, the sound gets distorted. Can't quite figure out what causes the distortion or why it happens after a given amount of time. I'll let the unit sit, and the next day it will work fine. I'm no sound engineer, so may very well be something to do with my setup, but like I said, everything worked fine without the volume control."
1,Had to return it,"While it was simple and easy to setup, I was not satifisfied with its operation.With volume attenuated on the volume control unit, any increase in the volume at the amplifier resulted in the amplifier temporarily cutting out and displaying 'protect' on the display (this is an Onkyo unit).I ended up returning it."
3,"It's nice, but bust is too small","This is such a cute babydoll, but I have two complaints: I ordered the 3x/4x and the stockings that came with it were way too small, you will probably have to buy your own stockings (that's what I did); second, the bust is way too small. If you have a larger ""bosom"" it's hard to squeeze those puppies in there. Other than those two things, it fits great and my boyfriend loved it."
1,Not for the busty gals.,"This picture is quite deceitful, I was under the impression I was getting something shiny all the way around, when in fact, the back is sheer and see through. The material makes a big difference when you are not an A cup up top. I am a D, and this does not stay on me at all. The dress fits fine but there is no tension to hold the girls in. So it sits away from my body and every movement would make it so they fall out of the cups. Ordering a smaller size will not help, because the the 'bra part' like most higher quality pieces, isnt made of a separate fabric, since they wanted to make the back sheer. But, if all your going to do is lay down on you back in this, I can recommend it? Like all the other reviews, the stockings are pretty terrible as well, definitely get some pretty ones of your own.. or do yourself a favor and skip this one if you aren't small chested.other than that.. this is my bfs favorite color and for all my fussiness with it.. he still really loved it. :)"
3,Pretty Nice! One small flaw though!,"This one is pretty nice - the color is terrific! and it's comfortable. The problem is the stockings absolutely do not even come close to fitting!I typically order 2x but upped it on this one - glad I did. A 2X would never have fit - this one just does - but the stockings are horrible! I typically wear a standard queen size Leggs pantyhose. These are supposed to be 3-4X - but they barely came over my knee and HURT. Way too tight at the top.Couldn't use them at all, and because the garters are attached to the bottom of the ""skirt"" on this, you can't use the outfit without some stockings.So as long as you plan on getting stockings elsewhere, this is a good item. You'd have to replace the stockings eventually (runs, etc.,) so I don't consider it a fatal flaw."
4,super hot,its a great fit but the bust area is weirdly tailored.... boobs dont fit in properly even though I am not very big chested!
2,No support,Beautiful fabric but for the large size the bra cup is too small and actually flattens any assets you have. Would probably look beautiful on a smaller frame.
2,Blah,"It's ok,something with the cups is off. They don't have shape even with the underwire, they just sit there straight. I tried to adjust like give some shape but nothing. The undies are really weird, like they sit sooooooo high up REALLY high up. The stocking are ok, not the best of quality, like they won;t stay up without the garters on, they fit like knee socks."
1,Inferior Quality.,"This product is so weak, it barely lasts an hour! This is either a sign of being too old, or not being stored properly; given the price, I would say it is old. Look elsewhere for a fresher version. This is great aftershave, but it should not be this weak."
4,Manly and cool,"This is different than the regular Royal Copenhagen as it is the musk. I ordered it by accident so I thought I would point that out. It has a nice sporty and manly fragrance to it. It is a clean fragrance, but is not as soft and baby powder-ish as the regular version. For the price it is nice to wear once and a while, especially to the gym."
1,Didn't work for me!,"Mounted solid and tight on my SKS but the inner diameter of the tube is to large for it to form enough of a seal for it to force the piston back to cycle the bolt, the gas just comes out the two vent holes on the tube. would like to return but it is past the return date... oh well NcStar has screwed me yet again."
1,LAME,"When I recieved the item, it actually shipped very quickly. Right out of the box I knew it would not fit, I also noticed it was missing a screw on the ""scope mount"" and it was a good bit to long. I know some people said they filed it down using sand paper but i feel like it would have been days of work, and I am just not all for that so I am shipping it back and purchasing a new one from another seller."
2,it looks good,"Well every SKS is a bit different, my gas piston slid right in, and I couldn't feel any suction/compression.then to install, you may have to file a good bit off the square end, take off a little at a time and try to fit, I used sandpaper. I got it on the gun, and noticed it had about 1/8th inch side rock to it, no way Id ever put a scope on it, sure it could be shimmed and made secure but Im not a gunsmith, but it looks good on the gun."
2,"worked, but not out of the box?!?!?!?!","got this for my yugo sks, went to drop the gas piston into it and would not fit......pulled it out and looked in the tube in the light totaly rust filled.....i say filled because i could scrape chuncks out. gave it a good cleaning pulled the rail off.....and fits fine now. havent got a chance to test it yet, its part of a project i put on the back burner"
1,Dont Buy this book!,"I just spent more than 100 USD to buy this book directly from Amazon. To my amusement (in a bad way), I open the book and see that all the words are pixelated, so bad that I can see small dots all around letters in the book. Don't waste your money, it hurts my eyes after reading just a few pages of the fax quality prints."
2,"The beats and rhymes don't make a ""konexion""","Freddie Foxxx - Konexion (Rapster, 2003)What a disappointment this album is. And they wonder why file-sharing programs exist, so you can listen to the album before you buy it! On every song of this album, either the production is decent or the lyrics are tight; it's one of the other, never both. The only exception to this is ""Me!!"" when Bumpy Knucks drops jewel after jewel over a nice beat: ""I seen Q-Tip turn into Maxwell and Shyne go to jail/White boys want my culture but they don't want my life/'Cuz when they stop being n****s they go back to being white"". But in the song before that, he spits wack rhymes like, ""I'm not like you/You're not like me/No matter what they say, boy/You're not like me"". Also, why is he always so mad? He complains that the industry is shady but it's hard to take him seriously with these plastic beats. He needs more beats from Primo, Pete Rock, Alchemist, and even himself like Industry Shakedown had. -EJR"
2,Major disappointment,"Crazy As A Foxxx and Industry Shakedown were as hot and street as it gets. This album is the opposite, it's like they asked him to put his worse out and the beats he got arent much either. Just another example of how those record companies continue to destroy hip-hop, rappers are asked to put out albums that are as flat as a white girls butt. Nowadays the simpler and wacker your album is the more you sell."
2,hmmmnnnn......sorry,"when it comes to this album, i was expecting production from pete rock, diamond D, and obviously Primo (which was there). This album was nothing but disappointment; the production and bumpy's flow just doesn't connect. and this is coming from a Hardcore fan of Industry Shakedown (i had to order it used from california). I can only just reminisce on his previous album, and i hope he goes back to what worked in the first place, like keepin his raw flow and bringing back production from true producers, granted he CAN produce but i prefer producers mentioned earlier. only thing now is to await his next album (hopefully in the works) and look for his true talent that we all know he has."
5,Straight Fire!,"With all the whack albums out today, how can anyone give this one 1 star out of 5?? Yes, Industry Shakedown imho was a bit better, but Bumpy straight brings it on this one too. Beats are good, lyrics are tight, so what more do you want? Fans of hardcore, but intellectual hip hop will want to check this one out IMMEDIATELY, then go check out Bumpy's other classic, Industry Shakedown."
1,Not Good!,"This product doesn't work. I buy all Clinique make up and tried All About Eyes and it works much better. Also, I didn't realize when I purchased RoC, but this product and all of their products are tested on animals-that's not pretty! None of Clinique's products are tested on animals-they are cruelty free. I will be sure to do my research before I make a purchase next time."
1,Awful Product - I hate it!!!!,"This eye cream is an AWFUL product with an overpriced tag. It stings so bad when you put them on. Plus, it did not stay on. The moment when you put your hand around the eyes, trying to feel it, the cream rubbed off on your fingers. It does not absorb well. Lastly, the product did not work for me as promised. My dark circle and wrinkles appear even more clearly with this product on!"
4,Good Stuff,"Under one eye I had a couple deep wrinkles and have been searching the internet for that miracle eye cream. I have been using this for about one week. When I put it on the first night, I noticed results the next morning on the problem area. I know it may sound weird but it's true. I use it in the morning and at night. I only hope with continued use all the under eye wrinkles and crows feet will disappear! I have ordered more roc products hoping for the same results!"
3,Maybe I'm Just Too Old...,"...but this product has not helped much. After trying it solo for two weeks, am now using it in conjunction with other eye creams. To be fair, it is allergy season here in central FL and that may be contributing to the extra puffiness. Still, not much improvement so buyer be cautious and keep expectations fairly low."
3,no difference,I'm using this day and night for a month and no big difference. Will use this till it's gone and I might post if things change --- not bad under eye concealer which preps the skin with moisture.... We'll see!
2,No difference at all,I've been using this for awhile now and gave it a chance. My eyes look as though I've never used anything at all. I would not recommend this product.
5,This thing is really creepy!,I've been using this product for over a month now(purchased it from a retailer the first time)and I've noticed that the puffiness around my eyes has virtually disappeared. I've never been used to my eyes looking tighter and smaller and it totally threw my off this morning. I'm creeped out by my own eyes now and by this product. I never actually expected it to work at all let alone work this well.
2,Still waiting for results,"I've been using this for several weeks now as directed. The skin is soft and moisturized, the cream is light and easy to apply, but I have not noticed any change in the fine lines or in the dark circles so far. Nor have I experienced any skin irritation at all-- I'm using it every day now with no ill effcts whatsoever."
3,Out of date,"I purchased the Roc Retinol Correxion Eye Cream 0.5 oz. When I received it, the product had an expiration date of 04/11. My order was placed in September of 2011.Be careful when buying items like this. You may get garbage like I did."
1,Roc products are tested on animals,"Roc is made by Johnson and Johnson Company - a company that is on PETA's list of companies that performsenseless, needless, CRUEL tests on animals with their products. I've never found any product that actuallyperforms miracles - FACT: you will age and get wrinkles. There are other products that can help youage gracefully, made by companies that DONT test on animals. You can research these companies on PETA's website - [...]"
2,Not that great. Disappointed,"I bought this eye lotion so I can get rid of my dark circles around my eyes, but all it did after a month of use, was to slightly reduce them. They are still very visible. I had high hopes because of all the reviews I read about it. I'm not going to buy a new one, I'll try another brand."
4,pretty good stuff,"i have not taken this long enough to see results yet,but it seems like its worth it so far. hope to keep using it to see the results."
3,Roc eye retinol correxion eye cream,"RoC Retinol Correxion Eye Cream is just ok. I think I am looking for something more viscous. I haven't really noticed a change. I used to use Lancome eye cream but it's just too expensive now. I wish I could find some info on the internet with good information about the actual ingredients in these products that actually target the problem areas specifically and if that's not possible, just say it."
2,Not great,"This product makes some pretty bold statements about under the eye circles disappearing along with diminishing wrinkles around the eye but after a solid month of using it twice a day, I can actually say that I see no difference at all. Not sure how they can continue to sell products like this so I am hoping my review will help somebody else before they waste their money."
4,Makes me look younger!,"I really like this product because it really works at fighting wrinkles and crepe eyelids. People always are surprised at my age (47) and especially compliment me on my eyes, which is interesting because I wear no eye makeup to make them stand out."
1,BEWARE!,"I used this product for approximately two weeks without any problem. All of the sudden, my eye swelled, got red and extremely irritated...i.e. I got an annoying case of contact dermititis. It has been over a week now and it is just starting to go away only because I began to use hydrocortisone cream. Needless to say, I am not happy with this eye cream at all. It is very harsh to be using any where near your eye area!! I would opt to use Estee Lauder or Clinique!"
3,"RoC Retinol Correxion Eye Cream, 0.5 Ounce","Simple instructions for how and when to use for the better effects 1, 2, and 3 is needed to users."
3,seems Good,"It seems okay, have;nt used it long enough to give a real verdict. I need to use it for awhile."
4,It works!,The fine lines around my eyes have become smoother! Have been using it for about 4 weeks now.. Glad to see the results!
4,Happy,The lines under my eyes seem to be less apparent. It's better to put it on in the morning and then the evening before bed. I'm glad I tried it. It's not a bad price for the amount ordered.
3,It's ok.,I was a long time user of L'Oreal's Line Eraser eye cream and I was so disappointed when it was discontinued. I ordered this for the retinol (thinking I would have the same dramatic results as Line Eraser). I haven't noticed a difference at all and I've been using it everyday for 7 months. I'm very disappointed!
2,I don't see any difference,"I have been using this cream for about two weeks or longer and to be quite honest, I don't see any change at all. I am very disappointed and would not buy this product again."
2,not that great,"Maybe this cream worked for other people, but it did nothing for me. This is no different than any other cream I've tried. I was really hopeful as the cost is cheap and the reviews were positive. It did make the skin under my eyes soft, so that was a plus. But, I will still be searching for a cream that helps my dark circles."
1,NOT REALLY A FAN,Dont notice any changes...the dark circles have slightly lightened..but not a product I would be willing to buy again.:(
5,Roc Rocks!,"I have been using this product for about a week and have noticed a big difference already. I am 28 and have just one or two creases around my eyes that I am working on fading, and also as a preventative. This stuff works, and I will be trying other Roc products in the future."
1,BEWARE,"I really don't have many wrinkles, bags, dark circles - have been blessesd at 62. Thought I better start using an eye cream to keep things that way! This product is VERY HARSH and my skin can take most anything. Second day I woke up with bags, dark circles and swelling which took 3 days to subside. Be very careful with this product."
3,Roc Retinol Correcxion eye cream,"Been about 1 month now with RoC Retinol Correxion Eye Cream. My wrinkles and fine lines are no better. However, the white bumps under my eyes have disappeared. Will use as a moisturizer but feel no eye cream will reduce or eliminate wrinkles. I am using Roc on 1 eye and Neutrogena Ageless Intensives deep wrinkle eye cream on the other. I like the consistency of the Neutrogena but also no help with the wrinkles. I do not think it helps with the bumps. Still looking, life goes on, and sometimes we just need to accept what comes with age."
1,didn't like it,I couldn't take the smell. It made me break out. I used this after running out of retin a. Not the same. Sticking with retin a.
1,Doesn't Work,I tried both of these products....the RoC Retinol Correxion Eye Cream and the RoC Multi Correxion Eye Cream and neither worked. There was absolutely no change in my skin or anywhere else for that matter. So I would NOT recommend it. I am giving the product one star because I have to rate it otherwise I would not give it any stars.
2,Did nothing for me...,I've been using this product for more than a month and it has not made any difference. I think it's a waste of money and time.
3,ROC review,"I have been using this for about 3 weeks. It feels nice on my eyes but has not done much for my dark circles, crows feet or puffiness? I have tried so many products and I don't see much of a result. I have just started using ROC Deep Wrinkle night cream. It has made me break out. I'm going to stick it out and see what happens. There are good reviews so I'm hoping for the best.i think with all the money I have spend on products just for my eyes I could of had them surgically fixed by now?"
4,"Noticeable, works well","I'm 38 and male. Thought I'd try to offset sun damage by starting this kind of product. I makes the skin smoother and fresher looking. No skin irritation or anything like that. I would recommend this product, especially for the price."
2,No change.,The ROC eye cream did not do a thing for me.I won't waste my money on any more of their products.
3,not for me,This was not for me and my skin. I am starting to notice that ROC brand products does not work for me well. It tends to make me break out if it is for the face or make me red. And I don't have sensitive skin either. I am 31 with fair skin and I am indian. Hope that helps.
3,Good,I bought this because I wanted to eliminate the bags under my eyes. I started using the product and it worked a little. Actually what started to help was that I started sleeping on back instead of sideways or on my stomach.
1,Made me look worse,"There are a lot of good reviews on here so I think it depends on the person. My circles are 100% from thin skin and genetics, still in my 20s, and I looked awful after using the product for a month. I think the retinol results in a good amount of exfoliation which in my case made the veins or muscles that create the darkness more visible. It's been about two weeks since I stopped using it and already I look a lot better, so luckily it wasn't permanent, but just keep in mind the product isn't for everybody."
5,Great product,"I have very thin skin under my eyes which makes wrinkles even more pronounced, but this product plumps it right up and my lines are less apparent. It doesn't burn it is nice and creamy."
3,Fairly Good,"This eye cream is good, slow but effective. I have used the product for approx. one month and it does erase fine lines. Maybe, after I finish the tube all the fine and heavier lines will disappear. It is an excellent bargain for the price."
2,Dark Circles Lighter but fine lines worse,It did make me dark circles fade a bit...but it made my fine lines a lot worse...it looked like my skin was dehydrated. I started using another eye cream again and the fine lines went away...it also caused some redness with my skin but thats the retinol.
1,:(,"Wishful thinking this product would actually do anything for my eyes. Just another over rated product, keep your money. It is however less expensive here then in a drug store."
3,To Help with Morning Meeting,"It's not quite what I thought it would be because my teach Kindergarten so some of the games are too hard to explain or not enough time in the day, but I plan to take them out some days and use these games. It's not a bad book though, esp. for the price!"
1,WAY TOO SMALL!,"My child is in the 40th percentil for weight and height, but I still couldn't squeeze him into it. It was long enough but way too narrow. I'm not sure who designed this outfit, but it's a horrible fit. Don't waste your money. It looks cute but the hat is huge. My two year old put the hat on and it was still a little big for him. Save your money and buy something else. You'll be disappointed."
3,Fits small,I would have given it a better rating if it was true to size. I bought this for my 6 year old and it was short. I thought a size 7-8 would be perfect because he normally wears a size 7. I thought it would have been a little big longer but I definitely needed a bigger size. It fits small.Toy Story - Woody Classic Child Costume - Medium (7-8)
4,My kid's favorite costume,"We have a big box of costumes that we've bought over the years and this has held up well. My sons can't fit in this one anymore but their younger friends can and they love using it. The fit was good and true to size, so take that into account when thinking about clothes underneath. You may want the next size up"
4,"Nice costume, runs small",My son just turned two and it is on the smaller side for him. He was able to wear it for Halloween but he has just about outgrown it for dress up. It is comfortable material and a good buy for the price.
1,Ethics doesn't seem to matter,"Nothing Down for the 90's is simply another way of saying that ""Greed is Good.""The author's unethical use of SPAM marketing invades the privacy of countless email accounts and further undermines legitimate attempts by people to use the internet in positive non-offensive ways."
4,Full of information!,"Real estate investing is not for the faint of heart. But this book is well thought out and the numbers do definitely make sense. I am a real estate investor as well as a property manager and own a brokerage. The key is once you buy the property, is to make sure you have good tenants who won't trash the place and put you in a bind if they leave in the middle of the night and you have literally thousands of dollars of damage. You have to not only buy right, but have the stamina to do the management, or hire a management company who can do a good job and you still can cash flow. You make money in real estate going into the sale! You hold on to equity by finding and keeping quality tenants. Definitely not pie-in-the-sky, but rather ""do-able"". And you need to pick your properties carefully and remember that location is everything. Allen's book is good for those who understand the basics of real estate, but definitely not for the rookie."
4,Arrested Development...,"Frank Zito (Joe Spinell) is a MANIAC. How do we know this? Is it because he lives w/ a collection of female mannequins? Or because these plastic ""women"" wear the bloody scalps of Frank's victims on their heads? Because he hears voices and answers them? Nope, we know Mr. Zito is a MANIAC by looking into his eyes! These bulging peepers are a definite tip-off that this guy has scrambled eggs in his skull! His eyes scream, ""Stay away, or I'll murder you!"". Spinell is the perfect MANIAC. He's just plain scary / crazy-looking! Tom Savini did a great job on the gore fx, and even gets to ""die"" in the movie's classic ""exploding head"" scene! Well worth repeat viewings..."
5,Great 80s slasher flick,"This is one of the greatest slasher that came out in the 80sIt actually inspired many slasher fans and even directorsOne of the best slasher films that came out in the movies during the 80s, and it's a cult classic now for the gore fansIf you love horror, gore, and splatterfest, MANIAC is just for you"
4,Maniac definitly delivers,Maniac is a great horror movie that makes you feel like youre watching more of a serial killers home video at times than a movie. The gore is good and thats expected as Tom savini is behind the makeup effects. Tom Savinis kill scene is by far the best in the movie. This is a deep and somewhat disturbing movie. Definitly recommended to all horror fans.
5,Maniac returns................,"When I think of Grind House films, Maniac is the first comes to mind. Maniac is a gory slasher, it's about a serial killer collecting women's scalps. Joe Spinell did a great acting job as the tormented killer. Caroline Munro plays a photographer, who winds up dating Mr. Spinell. I know this movie has been out before, but this 2-disc special edition looks to good to pass up. With this new release we got a glimpse of Mr. Robbi Maniac 2 that never got release. More updated interviews, and a lot more. Maniac is a hardcore 80's classic not to be missed."
3,Maniac....He is still out there!,"I remember watching this movie as a kid back in the mid 80's and if you really appreciate 80's movie in the Horror/Suspense Genre, then this movie won't disapoint. You have several good qualities such as a good story line, good acting, and great gore. I prefer more of a Friday the 13th type film, so I can't rate it 5 stars, but 3 stars for this type of Horror flick, may equal a 5 star for you, if you appreciate this type of film. It was wayyy better than average."
3,"""Le Bad Cinema""","I, like others, bought this DVD based on the reviews of this film. The movie is laughable and like another reviewer said, it reminds me of something for Myster Science Theater. During the 1980's, this might have been a little scary, but certainly not half of the hype it has from some reviews here. Save your money. If you want something Really scary, buy the new version of ""13 Ghosts"" or the classic ""Martin""."
1,Cult Horror,I wish it had been mentioned somewhere that this would be considered cult horror...and not good cult horror at that. Poor quality and a waste of time
1,"I'M A HORROR FAN,BUT THIS IS TRASH","This movie ranks down in the dumps along with the sloppy done Last House On The Left and I Spit On Your Grave(which also are [bad])too. They call this a horror movie,its not the least bit scary and the killer is some demented disocial nerd who just kills women for fun. This is pure [unacceptable material] people,it is not gory or sick so to speak,but very distastful and should be in the bargain bin ...,its that bad of movie and concept. STAY AWAY FROM THIS ...,UNLESS YOU ENJOY SOME LONELY GUY KILLING WOMEN FOR NO REASON AND TAKING THEIR SCALPS AS SOVENIORS. WORST FILM OF THE 80'S P.S. IF YOU WANT A REAL HORROR MOVIE CHECK OUT THE ORIGINAL 1978 (HALLOWEEN),1984(SILENT NIGHT,DEADLY NIGHT),(A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 1,3) AND YOU WILL BE GLAD YOU DID!"
1,Garbage pure and simple,This has got to be the absolutely the sickest bottom of the heap horror movie ever made. You have been warned!
1,Another sick entry in motion picture history,"When director William Lustig had the sick idea of makingthe most frightening and gruesome horror film, he shouldhave remembered one little thing. Less gore galore andmore suspense and a good storyline, involved with plottwists and other surprises.But Maniac is more of the same (like other pointlessslasher/stalker films). It shows more than it says andreally is as disturbing as offensive...Stay away from this movie...!!!jw"
1,ERRRRRRRRRRR it just sucks,"poor acting, fake blood, undescrible bantor, extheics poor, do i have to go on, I guess for it is time it was gore at its finest but can't compare to Freddy, or Scream movies of today."
4,How the film was meant to be seen,"After the so so DVD release by Elite Entertainment Anchor Bay have issued this orsome edition as part of their limited tin collection, I would recomend that you get this version of the film. You will also notice that the date scene between Spinell and Munro that was cut from the Elite edition has been restored to the film. A megga release of a megga film"
5,Scary Because It's Believable,"Life imitates art. The main character in this movie may have seemed over the top when it was released. But today, this movie seems almost like a documentary. This is a true horror classic. It's among the best of this particular genre. Do NOT watch in on a full stomach."
2,Horrible blu ray transfer,the quality of this movie is awful for a blu ray. i felt like i was watching a vhs tape. as a movie it has so much potential but its executed so poorly that its ruined until the last scene basically. i love the gorey deaths but other than that theres just nothing that special about this. the killer being a fatbody also kinda killed it for me cause i was laughing at how fat and disgusting he was. get it on dvd used if youre gonna spend money on this.
3,Scary,"This movie has a few scenes that are scary as hell. One scene features the maniac stalking a girl in a lonely, ugly, dirty New York Subway station. She runs from the killer and hides in a bathroom stall. Then the killer is walking in the bathroom and she is hiding in one of the stalls. What happens? See the movie! This scene has been done in dozens of movies before but they actually manage to make the scene scary and intense. Almost Hitchcockian. This killer is a real sicko. This movie had me checking my door to make sure it was locked before going to bed! I also went for a jog at night after seeing part of this and I was actually scared when running into strangers on the street! Thats my definition of a good horror film. It has you thinking about it after it is over. Not for the faint of heart or sensitive types. Not exactly a travel ad for NYC. The star of the flick is one ugly, psycho looking guy which makes the movie work so well."
2,Humongous Letdown!!!,"I bought Maniac based on reviews from Amazon, and what a piece of crap! Whoever said it was some of Savini's finest work obviously hasn't seen Dawn Of The Dead! Three scenes were good- THREE! The headshot, scalping, and Zito's demise delivered the goods, and Zito is a fairly well-played psycho, but the rest was almost unbearable in a watching-paint-dry kinda way. Not worth the buy.....maybe a rental...."
2,Good Premise...not so good movie,"Don't believe the hype on this one. This movie doesn't hold up and it appears very dated as it is. The premise is promising, but I felt the film progressed too slowly at times. The suspense wasn't there enough to keep me on edge. Joe Spinell's acting was good enough but it couldn't save this one. The two more memorable moments on this DVD are the scene where Frank Zito surprises a couple in a car by jumping on the hood and taking the driver's head off wth a shotgun at near point blank range. Well done, that's the kind of shock value and special effects I expected from this film. The other positive is in the special features section, where there's a Bio piece on star Joe Spinell that I truely found to be more interesting than the movie itself."
3,Blu Ray Version,"Great movie. But, the quality of the blu ray is comparable to the DVD. It was not crisp and clean but overall grainy. This was watching it on a 92"" screen and high quality projector."
5,Classic serial killer film,"One of the best movies to emerge in the genre, ""Maniac"" is about a homicidal psychopath who prowls the streets of New York preying on defenseless young women. ""Maniac"" is permeated throughout with a dark and sinister atmosphere and Joe Spinelli stars as an incredibly creepy serial killer who scalps the women he kills and nails the scalps to the bald heads of mannikins he has in his apartment. The special effects are some of the most incredible that I have ever seen and were masterfully created by the ingenious Tom Savini. ""Maniac"" is worth watching for the head exploding scene alone when the killer blasts a man's head apart with a sawed off shotgun. An exceedingly violent film, ""Maniac"" is recommended for fans of the serial killer genre and gorehounds alike."
3,Toughy,I watched this movie on the recommendation of a friend. I bought the boxed [tin] set simply because I'm a big fan of horror movies and usually you can't go wrong with them.This film was interesting to say the least. I thought that the actor playing the maniac was quite good. However there were long moments in the movie that were devoid of anything interesting visually and the voice overs were a little excessive. This is the reason I only gave the movie 3 stars.There are quite a few good gore scenes though and the story is believeable until the end which is is a little bit odd due to the supernatural aspects of it.Over all this is an interesting movie and a classic slasher flick. I recommend it for fans of gore and serial killer stories.I'm glad I bought it.
4,decent horror movie,"If you are a true horror fanatic, then you'll like this movie. Just be warned that after the exciting first 30 minutes of the movie, it becomes a long story with not miuch going on. I think it is brillant to have a psycho as a main character in a movie because you start to see just how crazy this guy really is. the gore that is in it is awesome, and the story line is somewhat disturbing, but overall i think this was a good slasher movie."
5,Fantastic,"Wont ramble on too much, but this is a brilliant movie. Great scalping scene in a hotel room, brilliant head explosion scene in a car, great stabbing scene in a public toilet and a raw camera technique that all aids in the effective filming of a movie portraying the world through the eyes of a mad man, brilliantly played by Joe Spinell. Not really for the faint hearted humanitarian type person, but, If you love splatter movies, disturbing movies, serial killers or you just want a movie to relieve tension, this movie is great. Call me a sicko, but I luurvvveeeee this movie man !!!!"
3,"Maniac is good, but not good enough.","I was SO looking forward to seeing this ""classic."" However, it is such a slow-paced film. You aren't sure at fisrt WHY Frank (the main character) is killing these women. It's a disturbing movie, granted. But, I suppose I was expecting more along the lines of a ""Chainsaw Massacre"" type of main character. Frank was just a weirdo that I didn't understand at all. Even at the very end of the movie, I had no insight into who he even was. THAT is the sad part. Even Michael Myers (Halloween) had a background and somewhat of an explanation of why he was the way he was (Yes, pure evil in human form) Ha! Anyway, if you can buy Maniac at a low price, it's a deal. If not, it's no huge loss."
1,Dont waste your money!!!,"I totally agree with the review posted by ""Brodyman""To quote his review ""This is a quick made gorefest to shock, story sucks, acting worse, and looks like it was filmed with a sony camcorder.""I love horror and its not often that I say I hated a movie... but I really HATED it! And cant believe how many people say they love it!! I'm so sad I wasted my money on this dvd. Anyone wanna buy it - lol"
2,Maniac is disturbing stuff,"I found this film absolutely depraved. The gore is intense and the humor is totally missing.There are some horror/slasher movies that I love, due to the intensity; ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""Silence of the Lambs"" come to mind comes to mind.Then there are the movies that are just disturbing, movies so rotten to the core that I just don't appreciate; ""Maniac"" is one of them."
3,"Maniac? nah, more like a momas boy","I bought this movie based on its many reviews but like so many other stink bomb horror movies i have purchased here lately this flick is more laughable than scary. I felt like i was watching mystery science theatre because i couldnt help but turn to my wife every few seconds and make some comment about the ridiculous acts taking place on screen. This movie is old so i'll give it a little more leadway than something made within the last 10 years but come one..... this NEVER could have been anything but a slasher flick. The director tries his best to add some unique camera angles (the blood cam) and build some suspense at times (the subway bathroom) but in the end this film fails miserably because the victums are stupid and the killer is a cliche. If your a fan of BAD HORROR and i mean to the tune of last house on the left you might enjoy this film but if your looking for something that may actually frighten you, keep looking."
2,so bad it's awful,"This movie seemed like a really, really bad episode of Tales from the Crypt. The title character was laughable. The scenes with him alone talking to himself, which are meant to show us just how maniacal he is, are terrifically silly. This film is a cliche ridden mess whose only saving grace is the presence of the very pretty Caroline Munro, whose character (for some unexplicable reason) befriends the beastly woman- murderer. A complete disappointment."
3,Maniac,I love this movie casue of the way it portrays a serial Killer to a true gritty relm. I would of gave it a 5 but was really bummed out by the transfer to Blu ray! It was horrible! Why bother this does not look like a good transfer to bluray but a poorly enhanced DVD!
2,Worst Blu-ray Transfer I've Ever Seen,"This review is not for the film itself, which I believe you either love or you hate. Its also not for the copious supplemental material included, which is phenomenal if you enjoy a lot of extras. Its for the quality of the Blu-ray transfer, which is honestly the worst I have ever seen. Perhaps the 16 mm source material is simply not appropriate for the high definition format. The picture is full of murky blacks, persistent grain, milky picture and very little appearance of anything ""high definition"". At best, the soundtracks has a lot of punch and is spotless and aggressive. Blue Underground perhaps should have considered the appropriate quality of the source before making a high definition transfer, which seems rather a pointless endeavor. I don't believe there is any way to make ""Maniac"" look great. If you have the DVD, you might want to just keep it and forget this release."
5,MASTERPIECE!!,"Joe Spinell was brilliant in this brilliant film. The plot is amazing and the entire time youre hooked on your seat.The mannequin idea is so perfectly creepy and the gore effects by Tom Savini are brutally delisciuos and what you expect from the master of splatter.The famous shotgun scene is probably still one of the best goriest scenes ever! ""Maniac"" is definitely a MUST for every horror movie fan..A MUST!!"
1,Good Blues but not very helpful,"If you're looking for instruction, keep looking. This guy can certainly play the blues, but the instruction is limited. There is almost no slow motion of the fingering and not a mention of what notes are being played. Video quality is excellent, but it is filmed from the right and left sides of the keyboard (no overhead shot) and the keys are often obscured from view. Add to that frequent switching of the viewing angle and it's almost impossible to follow what's being played."
3,A Useful Book,"James' book is basically a copy of Dee's own ""grimoire"" of Enochian and Heptarchic magick, excerpted by Dee from the raw material of his diaries. James' translations of Latin passages have been severely criticized by other Enochian scholars (e.g., Robert Turner) but the passages in question do not bear much relevance to the actual practice of the magick. James has also ""corrected"" the Enochian Calls so that -- in his estimation -- the Angelic versions fit better with their English translations; these small differences do not seem to greatly affect the potency of the Calls. His editorial intervention is otherwise minimal."
4,"Excellent as a reference, poor as an introduction.","James has distilled the magically useful material from Dee's often-obscure diaries and presented it in organized form, creating an ""Enochian grimoire."" However, some of the material was not delivered in the order in which James presents it, and there is little historical or background information. I recommend Donald Tyson's _Enochian Magic for Beginners_ to people who lack experience with Enochian magic, and this book as a handy reference for those who already have the background knowledge that James does not provide."
2,Glue it together and call it a book,"It seems this book has made a impression on folks here, well for applying the magic it would need to give more details. It feels as if the compiler of this knowlege just, threw it toghter, in the order in wich it was recived... I much prefer Tyson."
5,Best CD to come out in the US this year,"The Storm is one of those rare rock albums that comes along every few years with absolutely no filler. From huge driving rockers which explode with melody to soaring, heartfelt ballads, this one's guaranteed to put a smile on your face. There's the obvious comparisons to Journey, but this is sooo much better than ""Trial by Fire"" - more like Journey on steroids and with superior songwriting. Having Gregg Rollie and Ross Valory in the group naturally helps.....the production from Nigel Green (Mutt Lange's apprentice, who was very much involved in albums like Hysteria) is very well handled and delivers the songs sharply. I promise you - from the first strands of larger-than-life opener ""Don't Give Up"", you'll know the purchase was well worth the money."
4,Elite Rifle Rest,"For the sale price, an incredible buy; I've been using it to test air rifles, and it provides a rock-solid, reasonably adjustable, rest."
4,Rifle Rest Good For the Price,"Easy assembly and appears sturdy - leveling bolts are larger than they appear in the picture. (Haven't used at the range yet.) Stand is rather light, so will have to use shot or sand bags with it. Not as adjustable as the Pacific Outdoors Premier Rifle Rest which has the same non-sale price here on Amazon. Bought it on sale at a significant discount. As normal, Amazon's quick delivery."
1,Customer Service stinks,I bought a flomaster model that was similar to this a little over the year ago and spent more to get the 10 year warranty. $7.95 postage for each time I had to send back the pump attachment and when the problem was with the tank itself I was told I had to pay to send the whole thing in and if my removing the bad pump damaged the tank they would not cover it? If you want something to last more then two applications go with a company that stands behind it's warranty.
1,Awful,"I could not for the life of me get the unlocking mechanism to actually let me pour fuel into my vehicle. The only gas that would come out of the can came from the leak where you screw the spout on. I can use it now because I put the spout under a drill press and punched through the internal locking device. No other leaks or deficiencies, but for the price it is definantly not worth it. I would pay no more than $15 for this POS, only because you can make it usable with a little work and it fits into the jerry can rigs for your vehicle."
1,Crap product and service shameless,"Like the other reviews, the so called spill proof spout is terribly complicated to use and is not very durable, easily broken. Much spillage of course while figuring out how to get the gas out. Would NEVER buy this product ever again, nor do business with this company."
1,No good,I bought one of these cans from Tractor Supply. The spout doesn't work at all. The only reason I give it a rating of 1 is because there's no zero option. Don't waste your money.
3,OK Gas Can,"This is a ok gas can. It will NOT fit in a standard 5 gallon ""Jerry can"" holder like found on many military vehicles. Spout is clumsy, but all of the new ones are."
3,Newer version has a different spout.,"I am only giving this a 3 star review, because I've not really used it yet. The overall design seems very sturdy.Most of the complaints here are about the spout directly and not about the physical can. If my spouts start to leak, I will replace them, but as long as the cans do not leak from the bottom, I'm fine with it.Of course with CA being so great, every fuel can I have seen still uses the same stupid spout that sucks. So as far as comparison, most of todays modern fuel cans are roughly the same. This goes for the Metal jerry cans as well, many have complained of the actual can leaking. Which to me is worse then the spout leaking.The model I purchased has a different spout with a green lock ring. It's easy to operate and doesnt look like it will leak, but we will see."
1,Leaks and no customer service,"This plastic can which is approved by the Califoria Air Resources Board leaks. The specially shaped seal deteriorated after about a year of service. Replacements are unavailable. The nozzle is too short to reach safely into the gas tank and the plastic container is easily damaged plastic construction. During transport the nozzle cannot be placed in a safe condition. It sticks up in the one available fixed-position. It is dangerous, but the fact that the manufacturer does not respond to email inquires for replacement seals means the can is useful for about a year."
1,Useless and dangerous,"STAY AWAY from this can.This is about the worst piece of engineering I have come across in years. (If engineering was involved at all in its design)1.) There is no conclusive description of how to close and open the safety mechanism.2.) The mechanism is faulty3.) It takes time to figure it out4.) Using the spout means you always get your fingers dirty with fuel5.) The spout is leakingI wasted an hour on this mechanism and spilled a pint of gas in the process.In short: Useless and dangerousBTW, I was trained in the army as a fuel and ammunition handler."
1,Worst design and execution I have seen,"This was the first gas can I have bought in years. The salesman demonstrated briefly how the system works. I got home and neither I nor my son can make the can work correctly without gas seeping out and running all over our hands and the equipment. We tried several times and then went to their website (as referenced on the can) only to find out that the videos there don't match the products they sell. Our mechanism for pouring was for more difficult to use and far less stable than what their video showed. Bottom line, both cans go back tomorrow. Horrid product. Run away!!"
1,"Modern, politically correct gasoline containers","The vendor did well.The container is typical of modern American, nearly useless, but super safe, mediocre products."
1,the nozzle is not only child proof it is adult proof as well.,The container is OK .the spout was designed by idiots.Stay away from this garbage.If you can find a non Carb spout to put on this please let me know
3,Spout wears out in 1 year,"I have 2 of these cans and the spout has stopped working after 1 year. The plastic or rubber components are not well made. And I cannot get a replacement.NOTE: I did contact the company and they replaced the spouts. They are difficult to contact and it tool 2 separate mailings to get the spouts and screw on connectors, but they were replaced. So I am updating this comment to note that."
2,Thank You Republic of Kalifornia,"This is the commercial replacement of what was a great product by Scepter of Canada, the military jerry can. Most of the reviews comment on the CARB compliant spouts. I've found that if I use this product it works pretty well:http://www.amazon.com/Moeller-Scepter-Diesel-Water-Spout/dp/B000MT94S8/ref=pd_rhf_cr_p_t_2There is also a yellow Scepter spout you can use on the can that will permit you to close the can for transport.None of the box stores sell a fuel can that is worth spending money on. It's highly disappointing that the CARB laws spread across the country resulting in this consumer product line."
4,Josh is Impressive,"Produced by the same guy as Dave Matthew's Band (John Alagia), with a musical style similar to John Mayer's or Jack Johnson's, Josh Kelley makes an impressive debut with his first album ""For the Ride Home."" What can I say? I like it. It's mellow then upbeat, all the while exploring various musical and emotional climaxes and nadirs. Literally, it's a CD for you to play on the car ride home time and time again. It's also consistent; if you don't like to buy CDs because you're afraid of ""filler"" (other songs on the album not as good as or not even similar to the single) you don't have to worry about it with Josh Kelley. There are many songs on the album with ""single potential."" If this is you're kind of music, I'm sure you'll like the album as much as I do."
4,lovin this album,"The first time I listened to Josh Kelley’s debut album “For the Ride Home,” I was literally amazed by “Amazing.” Also, I liked the message of “Everybody Wants You,” which essentially consists of Josh telling himself not to forget where he came from, not to get star struck by fame.Here is a boy from Georgia with folk pop roots that entertain immensely. You can hear his Southern influence in “Angeles” and fully appreciate his ability to create musical mood in “Faces.” Overall, his mellow guitar riffs and soulful lyrics make for a joyful and relaxing experience reminiscent of John Mayer or Jack Johnson. If you like these kinds of artists, you should definitely try Josh Kelley."
5,Wonderful!,I have had Josh Kelley's cd for a while now and it's always one I come back to. It's one of those rare cds that I can put on and enjoy every single song. He's an amazing songwriter and singer. I even went out and bought the special edition cd just to get the bonus tracks! I can't get enough of this guy. You must check him out!
3,Hmm,"I heard this guy and was like ""Wow, the wallflowers came out with another album!"" Then I saw that it was Josh Kelly singing, and I thought ""But the lead singer of the wallflowers was dylan's son - he got a name change?"" Anyway, you get my drift. JK does a really great job at emulating Jakob Dylan's voice. I bet he got some of his fame doing covers for the wallflowers didn't he?"
4,"Don't actually have this CD, but i have a reccomendation...","I haven't bought this CD yet, but i'm planning to, he's got a john mayor vibe, and something else...but i wanted to say that if you like Josh Kelly, and a little bit of Dave Mathews, you'd probably like my brother's cd...he's just an ordinary guy, but he's trying to make it in the music world, and he's got a lot of talent and deserves it. If you'd like to know more about my brother, or maybe even get his CD...go to www.alexsmithmusic.comAgain, my brother works really hard, and i even like his music..and that's saying something, considering i'm his baby sister!"
5,Simply Amazing!,"I saw Josh Kelley perform live at a Goo Goo Dolls Concert in Los Angeles and I have to say, he was amazing! I was in LaLa Land when he was on stage. All of his songs are beautiful. That was the very first time I had heard him and now, he's in my car. This is the CD I listen to now. Every single song I love. He's got a little bit of everything. His voice is incredible. You will love this CD."
4,Great,"In the midst of hustle and stress of modern society, it is refreshing to hear an artist that relaxes your nerves and takes you back to simpler days. Josh's soft vocals sooth the ear. The production on the album is simple which isn't bad because this complements his laid back style of writing and delivery. Artistically he has real potential, this is his first album yet there are zero guest appearances. It should be interesting to see what future material will sound like. He is amazingly consistent from song to song. I recommended this album to anyone that likes music with a slower pace or anyone that needs a break from there usual selections."
1,Try again,"This book was required reading for a religion class at my school. It had a good intent and a fairly bright outlook on life however as a teen i found it patronizing. You will be presented with an idea and it will be defended to some success however in the next chapter it will very often contradict it's own ideas as if they had never been stated. It's outlook on life is flowery like you would tell a child but lacks the real world as it's defece. This is a book for troubled youth, for someone overcoming an assult and needs something overly simplistic and nice on the rebound. My belief is that the world doesn't fit in the box presented by this book. I also didn't like the little bells and whistles through this book it's like a web sight with to many sponsers, anamated pictures with little comments through the entire book which do nothing but distract the reader. Under no circumstances should this be required reading. Also i have never seen so many lists outside of death row in texas."
3,"BEAUTIFUL, BUT . . .","THIS IS EXCEPTIONALLY BEAUTIFUL, BUT THE PRICE IS WAY TOO HIGH. IF YOU'VE GOT MONEY TO BURN, GO FOR IT."
4,Make sure you already have rip cord and launcher,"Does not include a rip cord or launch, had to find out the hard way.Luckly friend had one."
3,cheap bulbs burn out in 1 week,"This light itself is good quality, and OK, but 2 of the 3 ""included blubs"" burnt out in 1 week. (I did not touch the bulb glass as per instructions). Replacements are $9.50 each. The quality repleacements are also brighter for same wattage, so the thing looks funny. They should charge less and you get your own quality bulbs. I would avoid halogen due to the high bulb cost and high heat. Also, the pictures suggested the fixture can point down as well as up, but in reality it can only point up due to the halogen design. They should make this clear since you may not want it to point up."
2,Just okay...,I have installed many aftermarket radios and this mount was the cheesiest so far. Not very sturdy or aesthetically pleasing. I will probably replace this with a better quality unit sometime soon.
3,Not so sure if I'll be ordering more Matlock,"I only recently found out that Andy Griffith supports someone I despise...Obama. So now I have to really dig deep to decide if I want to order more Matlock because I used to respect both Andy Griffith and the characters he plays. That is no longer the case regarding the actor. My family has had no problem whatsoever with not supporting Hollywood's liberal agenda by boycotting movies and music with liberal ""talent"" shoving their crazy ideas in our face."
3,Trend Analysis of value Stock selections weak effort,Most investors probably have a feel for the megatrends discussed. It was comforting to hear from such a successful pundit that the trends are intact. Offering stock choices that will benefit from the megatrends offered minimal value to this reader. My general feel is the the author didn't try very hard and was cashing in on his reputation. I would not recommend the book and have not shared it with fellow investors.
1,bad investment,"buying this book is bad investment, demorgrapics says people are growing old, so buy cannon because the old people will buy its cameras to take photos of their grandchildren, what kind of logic is that? is it a safer bet to buy companies making adult diapers?"
4,Good footrest,"I did not really try out any footrests at stores. I ordered this off of amazon since it was the best model that humanscale makes. I have a herman miller mirra chair, and i use this footrest with it. The footrest is comfortable and fun since it rocks. It is a very attractive piece of furniture, though i think the price is a bit high (~$82 shipped).Some people might complain that it is not height-adjustable, but that problem is easily remedied by putting a few boards underneath it. I do not have this problem as the footrest is the right height for me but figured I would just add this in to the review.I hope this helps!"
5,AMAZING TO BE ABLE TO WATCH A CARTOON FROM WHEN I WAS A CHILD,I still cannot believe that I can watch one of my favorite cartoons from childhood. It is just such an amazing feeling to be able to watch it again after 20 or more years. It looks great on a big tv! The quality of the dvd's is great!
5,Good Deal,The first one that was ordered and it came with just a box and a door. No surface mounts with spaces. But Amazon replaced it and the second one came complete.
1,"Does not Cool anymore, Very bad customer service","I have this Haier HC125FVS for less than five years old. It stop working, The unit makes click noise but the compressor does not start and its very hot. I think the compressor is bad. So I called customer service for the warranty service, but they will not come and check the compressor which has five years warranty. They want me to call Appliance repair company and pay for the opinion that the compressor is bad, than they will send the compressor and I have to pay for the compressor installation, which will be more than the actual cost of buying new unit. So, technically this company warranty of the compressor for five years is useless. I will never buy any product made by this Haier company."
1,Poor customer support and cxchange process takes forever,"ONLY IF you trust Haier's products and think you do not need an exchange, go ahead and order their products. Otherwise, like us, we paid $15 for exchange fee, plus mailing fee of the exchange documents, plus 2+ months not being able to use a product that you purchased where Haier should hold the responsibility for the damage.Their support service is terrible. They ask us to have shipment tracking for our exchange documents, but they do not have their shipment tracking for the appliance delivery. Their system sucks and cannot provide any information to you except saying, ""you will receive the new appliance 7-15 business days after we approve all your exchange documents"", which, however, is absoultely not true since it never happens, so far."
3,I'm not too impressed,"I bought this for our garage (""man cave"") we had just finished. The packaging looked fine when it arrived, but after I opened it it was clear the fridge had been dropped because the bottom hinge was bent and the door wouldn't close properly. Luckily for me my husband is handy; he was able to fix the problem (which is why I opted for the 3rd star~ it works now, so ""it's ok""). If I had to do it over again, I would've purchased the more expensive one I had seen in one of the ""big box"" stores; it was defiantly higher quality. In this case, you pay for what you get. :o/"
1,Never Received item no communication,"I ordered this product and a week later customer service in India was still adiment that the cooler was on its way. I notified him that it had been listed as ""broken"" during shipment. Eventually he refunded my money, but my business is now almost 2 weeks without a cooler and I am a prime member. The item is still available, but they charge $53 for shipping and, surprise, surprise, Prime members don't get free shipping. They should send me a replacement, rushed but instead they're pretending like they don't have any in stock. Amazon and Target, a BAD Combination!-Not so cool in Cali"
1,"Loud, Energy Hog, Frosts Quickly, Not Great At Cooling","I received it as a Christmas gift and have been running it since. It's loud, it runs nearly all day, it frosted up within a day, it costs about $50/mo. to run and it doesn't do a great job cooling. It's going up on craigslist pretty quick."
3,Scratch and Dent,"I just bought this item at Sam's. Upon bringing it home, the unit was dented and warped. I plugged it in and it appears that the unit is running. I loaded it with drinks and I am waiting to see if it works. The door seems to be sealed despite the dents and warping in the body of the unit. The packing was done very poorly, its no wonder the damage occurred. I hope they built this cooler a lot better than the way they packed it. I am hoping to take pictures of the damage and take the picture back to the store to see if they will reduce the price. I don't want to return this if I dont' have to. Feel too lazy."
5,BARLOW ON GAMBLING,"I constantly refer to this book when comparing systems and the advice in this book has steered me away from ""new"" super systems that promise to win you millions and stopped me playing some of the old standbys.It promises consistent wins and delivers on that promise .It also promises you won't win millions and that in itself makes it a rarity an honest book on and look at gambling.For most it won't appeal to the ""gamblers blood""or anyone with a short attention span as the progression/regression series require your full focus and attention and would be to much of a grind for most.VIC"
5,A must have for anyone comtemplating visiting a casino !!!!!,"Although this book has been around for years, I believe that the content is up to date. Offers excellent information on how and why systems work (or not, as is usually the case), betting progression, and a unique insight into bet selection. Don't miss out on the best book on casinos and gaming - it will save you many times the purchase price."
1,delightfully awful,"""Battlefield Earth"" bring us two concepts that should never be combined: Forrest Whittaker and codpieces.This is a work of epic miscalculation. It's just stunningly bad. Even simple things, like lighting and continuity - things that the filmmakers might have gotten right by accident - are horribly mangled.The sets? Terrible. The costumes and makeup? Ludicrous. The story? Oh, let's not get started. What I'm trying to tell you si that this is one of the funniest unintentional comedies I've ever seen. I watched this with a friend and we were slack-jawed with amazement throughout.If you're a connoisseur of bad film, this is a must see. But I still recommend a few stiff drinks to take the sting out. Even if you got through ""Waterworld"" with your sanity intact, this one's gonna hurt."
1,Not just awful... claim flavoured awful,"Reading the few, similarly written positive reviews of Battlefield Earth leaves a funny taste in my mouth... the taste of clams! And no amount of schilling by those that might benefit from the success of this piece of junk will change just how bad it is.Yes, I've seen it, and Battlefield Earth is awful. Unlike so many awful flicks that somehow provide some camp entertainment, this one just plain sucks. It isn't fun. The acting is terrible. The plot is makes almost no sense, the action is poor, the special effects not that great.Save your money."
1,The Movie Ruined a Great Book,Battlefield Earth is one of my top ten favorite books but the movie is definitely one of my least favorite of all time. I'm not sure how the directors could have botched such great material when they made the movie. I hope that sometime in the future Peter Jackson will take on the project of remaking this great story.
1,Great--as a Comedy! Where's the Zero Stars button?,"I'm not even going to bother wasting time with a long review on this one. Let's just say it's a long way from Travolta in ""Pulp Fiction."" What is really shocking is that this waste of celluloid actually got 67 five star reviews here on Amazon. These people should be drug tested."
1,This Movie Is Worse Then The Powerrangers,"Wow, I got this movie for free. I won it in a contest from ign.com, nd it blows. Do not rent this or even think about buying it at any cost. If you like this I think you have some kind of problem, this movie shouldn't even be in my movie collection. I do watch this movie to have a really good laugh..."
1,ARRRGH!,"Oh My god!! What a hell is that?!My Dog could make a better movie!I don't know what this movie is about, I stopped watching it with 15 minutes! Two hours of my life are too important to spend whith this garbage!"
1,This Movie is a Trainwreck,"Wow...this movie was horrible. It is so bad it's good...except then it gets worse. Every time you blink some other implausible plot line is happening, complete with lack of character development or even continuity. Having read the book, I sorta knew what was supposed to be happening...except other than some vague references it really doesn't have a whole lot to do with the book. Travolta takes the cake for horrible acting in it. If you want something on in the background that nobody will pay attention to, then this is the movie for you."
1,Akkk....,"Really... it's not worth my time to write this... but just to warn those whom venture here. The short and long of it. Terrible, terrible acting, lost plot, annoying nuances. I did sit all the way through this hoping it would get better, but it did not."
1,Waste of time & energy,"Simply put: A must to avoid. The novel was the same; simply awful, and the film adaptation is no better (and maybe worse). I would give this 0 stars but Amazon will not allow it."
1,One of the worst movies i've ever sat through.,"I'm not one to walk out of the movie once i've started watching it,but in retrospect if I could pick 2 hours of my lifeI could have back...I would have preferred to never see this movie.Biggest load of garbage i've seen produced in main."
1,"A future cult classic - still 1 star, though.","Johnny T should have been fined his salary and have been forced to do a ""Welcome Back Kotter"" made for TV reunion film. The movie is so bad that in 20 years - it just might have a cult following. Hell, with a buying price so low (I wonder why?), buy it and have some laughs. If it goes out of print in a few years, then you have a hot film on your hands. It's happened."
1,'Battlefield' Wallet,"It was definitely a battlefield in my wallet after I wasted five dollars to see this ugly thing called 'a movie'. I was disappointed with John Travolta's performance as a big, tall alien. He despised human beings and thought the alien race was superior. Boy, was he wrong! You mess with Barry Pepper, you will have ten layers of glass broken and eat rats! This is possibly the worst thing ever made. Maybe you can put Chucky the doll with John Travolta's alien and you'll have the ultimate movie. Humans can't fly and why are they wearing rags? It's supposed to be the future? I don't know, I don't care. Forest Whitaker also appears in this vile, sadistic movie and I just blacked out for a while after it was over."
1,terrible!,Battlefield Earth is failed attempt to popularize scientology through bad film making. Go to rottentomatoes .com and read the reviews--96% of movie critics panned this Travolta bomb.
1,Definately a Rental,"Having never read the book I can't attest to how closely the movie follows, but having seen a movie before I know that this one was horrible. It was a seventies screenplay dropped into 90's special effects. I find it an insult to the audiences' intelligence that Hollywood believes any script should be put on the screen as long as it has top-notch computer animation. What a flop. After watching it I was not surprised it only lasted two weeks in the theaters."
1,worse than expected,"I rented this expecting to have a campy good time...had a few beers and sat down with a few friends for a few hours of entertaining cheese. However, the movie wasn't even enjoyable. It's not campy, just poorly written, poorly acted and poorly directed. It's just bad. Stay away at all costs."
2,I am in love with Kelly Preston.,"I gave this movie two stars, because I am in love with Kelly Preston. The scene in this movie where she stretches her tongue out is surely worth a star (and since one is the minimum, that means 2/5). Otherwise there is nothing good in this movie.God, where do I begin? The movie is just such a mess I can't imagine where to begin. I rented it on the impression that it would be bad, so as not to give myself unrealistic expecations. I'd heard it was bad. But, how bad could it really be? Would John Travolta sign up for such a sorry screenplay? Yes, folks, he would. He did. This movie IS as bad as people say it is. Like I said, it's a mess. It's a squalid, room-hasn't-been-cleaned-for-six-months mess."
3,"Pretty bad acting, sci fi ok","Stilted dialog and pretty bad acting make this a B movieof the old school. Reminds me of 50's rocket's space opera.Still it is sci fi...The idea of a really stupid selfish race with space traveltaking over other planets isn't all that new.A cave man level human society taking on the aliensis pretty unique. With a little better dialog forthe aliens and better acting, it might have escapedwhole?!"
3,Battlefield Earth Review,"I bought this DVD simply because I thought the story line was a good for a sci-fi story. The storyline is slow at first as the story develops but slowly develops into a basic greedy alien occupying earth story. It is not a bad movie if you are into the different prospective type sci-fi movies, but you may not like it if all you are expecting are action and surprises. I rate it at 3 stars which means to me that you may want to rent it first before you buy it."
1,Stupid....how did it even get produced?,"when this film came out back in 2000, i wisely read the reviews---not from just one critic, mind you; i like to get a wide view of opinions--and learned that this film was horribly created. having read those reviews, i stayed away from the film at the theatres. last night, while flipping through the channels, i noticed it on Showtime and was curious to see how terrible it really was. right from the beginning, i realized this was worse than the campy sci-fi films of the 50s. those you could at least laugh at. but this was just utterly horrendous. while i admire John Travolta's attempt to bring to the film a great book, one dear to his heart, why did he chose that director and cinematographer? what was up with those camera angles? why did we need to see Johnnie and co. from a 37 degree angle? what was wrong with just a straight angle? what was up with the terrible editing? in other words, HOW COULD IT EVEN BE PRODUCED?"
1,The movie by another name,"The only thing this movie had in common with the book was the title, and the name of a few characters. That, and a planet was blown up. The whole book was rewritten for the movie. Not once did it follow the book. Utter trash, garbage not worth the film stock it was shot on. Give it another name, and remove the Psyclo reference and it is a B movie. As it is, anyone who enjoyed the book will not be disapointed, you will be enraged!"
3,Really nice CGI!,"I really liked the special effects and the CGI. They were great! Though I can't say that it does justice to the book (the book was probably the best I've ever read), not many other movies can make that claim either.Overall it's a pretty good movie."
1,"Really, really bad","The reviews of this movie were bad, but not nearly as bad as the movie. If you took the entire book, eliminated 3/4 of it and rewrote 2/3 of what remained, what you have left is the characters' names, maybe! I think some of the characters only appeared in the credits. The continuity of this film makes the original ""Dune"" movie look seamless. Comparing ""Starship Troopers"" to this makes ""Starship Troopers"" look as good as ""Star Wars"". I, too, am a fan of John Travolta - so I forgive him."
1,Battlefield Mirth,"There's stupid, there's inept and then there's ""Battlefield Earth"". One of those almost other-worldy cinematic experiences that makes you shake your head in utter disbelief, ""Battlefield Earth"" will unquestionably be the ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" for the 21st century. Having read about a third of Hubbard's ""Mission Earth: The Invaders Plan"", I really have to wonder how Scientology has flourished around a hack writer with paranoid notions about psychology (ie: The Psyclos"") and beauraucracy (evidenced in this film and ""Mission Earth""). This movie can only be fully appreciated whilst heavily intoxicated or not completely awake.And as for a sequel..... END"
1,Unrealistic,"I thought the movie started off okay, with a few jokes that at least got a giggle out of me, but from there it turned into a very hokey and unrealistic movie. I walked out at the end of the fight between humans and Psychlo because it became too rediculous. This is a movie I do not want to watch ever again."
1,the most badly made big budget movie ever made.,"ENDLESS OPTIONS FOR RENEWAL,ENDLESS OPTIONS FOR RENEWAL,ENDLESS OPTIONS FOR RENEWAL. HA,HA,HA,HA,HA,HA,HA,HA,HA,HA,HA,"
1,the worst piece film to ever taint the screen -total rip-off,"i dont understand how this film made it to the big screen or to dvd...it is the worst film i have ever watched in my entire life (and i've seen pretty lame ones in my time).i dont know what caused the poor film...was it the infusion of some religious subplot into it, or just poor film making. i have always loved travolta, but becuase of this film, i have vowed never to watch a movie by him again in protest - i feel robbed."
1,"May be a fun sci-fi movie, but it is not Battlefield Earth","Very disappointing. I am a sci-fi fan for many years. I may have enjoyed this movie. But Battlefield Earth is a great book, and this movie does it such an injustice, it is indescribable. When the movie first came out I read movie critic's reviews that spoke badly about the book based on their seeing the movie. It seemed obvious to me the critics I read had never read the book. They couldn't have. Again, as a sci-fi movie, you may enjoy it. But as a depiction of the book, this movie is very, very bad. Very disappointing."
3,Battlefield Replay,"If one can disregard Mr. Hubbard's magnificent book as it may apply to this movie, then it can be classified as a mediocre action adventure. If you have seen Planet of the Apes, you will recognize the plot. In fact, if you have seen any action movie in the past ten years, you will recognize stock scenes: Slow running through gunfire; Glass falling in slomo; The ultimate hero. But, it is John Travolta and I am a big fan, so yeah, I bought it and will keep it in my collection. Maybe play it for my friends and we can do a Mystery SciFi 3000 session on it."
1,Run Away,"This movie is terrible. The reasons why this film is lacking have been documented in prior reviews. The critics are correct. Stay far, far, away from this movie if you are interested in genuine entertainment."
1,Worst film ever,"This movie definitely deserves the title: Worst Sci-fi movie ever created. It had terrible acting by an A-List actor(John Travolta), over a billion plot holes, and weird camera angles. If they(the movie studio) had recast the whole movie, got rid of the tilted camera angles, hired a different director, hired a new script writer, and basically changed everything about the movie Battlefield Earth could probably not be called The Worst Sci-fi film ever."
1,"book good, movie BAD","Anyone who has read the book just knows there would be no way to make a movie of it. So why try? The book was the first science fiction I ever read and I loved every single far out minute of it. So read people, and forget this movie even exists. This link is making me give it at least one star--I didn't want to give it any."
1,Utter Scud,"Come on People!Now do you see what Hollywood producers think of your intelligence? This film was an insult to the viewing public. Such could well be expected from John Travolta (Who has betrayed us with films like Broken Arrow, White Man's Burden, and Face Off) but for Barry Pepper to put so black a mark on so promising a career, so early on is absolutely inexplicable. My head aches from the ghastly camera angles, shot so as to increase the film's intensity, even as I write this. Recollection of this movie alone, is neaseating. I am left all the worse for ware. Utter Spud Scud! Save your time save your money, save yourself..."
1,I never even made it to the climax,"Sorry - couldn't get into it. I was so turned off by the pathetic attempt at creating an alien with all-too-human characteristics that I never got to see the plot unroll. I tried watching this movie three times at the recommendation of others and couldn't get past the first hour on any attempt. Usually I made it about 25 minutes and then started cleaning my house as a much more exciting way to spend my time. I mean really, in this day and age a twisted hairdo isn't enough to represent an alien."
1,What were they thinking...,"Take a so-so science fiction book (Id give it 3 stars) and put it through the Hollywood wringer with a director that spends a massive budget on big name actors and special effects. Plotline, pretty awful and has absolutely huge holes that you could fit a carrier battle group through. I mean, harriers that are in one piece after 1000+ years, let alone fuel and munitions and are able to outfight an alien race that conquered Earth in 9mins? Was there any actual thinking that went into this? Many of those A-List actors, this is the worst parts I have seen them in; Im not sure if it was the director, the script writer, or the actor just not giving a damn about the part.Frankly, the nicest things I can say is that it does end, and it fun for drinking games. It really makes me wish that MST3K were still around so they could heckle this pile of crap, maybe then it would be watchable. Otherwise, steer clear of this flick."
1,horrible film...,"If I could go into negative numbers as to rate this I would. The movie doesn't half HALF of what is in the book. And no matter how ""famous"" John Travolta is, you don't star someone first who plays a bad guy! I hope one day IF a remake can be done of the book it will be more true to the book (and star someone who plays the GOOD guy, not the bad guy...)."
1,horrors!,"""Battlefield Earth"" garnered an unprecedented eight nominations for the Golden Raspberry Awards (the ""razzies""). Having sat through it myself, I can tell you, it is not hard to see why. It's really hard to describe how incredibly abyssmal ""Battlefield Earth"" is. It's a derivative, sloppy, shoddy, implausible nightmare of a film, a train wreck, a riot of bad acting from people who know better. It's the kind of film Edward D. Wood Jr. would have made if he'd had a big budget. Worst of all, it wastes Forrest Whittaker, who was so excellent in ""Ghost Dog: the Way of the Samurai.""Occasionally, I am in the mood for a laugh at a really bad film. At those times I watch something by Ed Wood or Phil Tucker's ""Robot Monster."" Now, ""Battlefield Earth"" will join them on my list for years to come."
4,Behind the scenes features make for an excellent DVD,"One of the most fascinating features about the Battlefield Earth DVD is the running comments by the director and art director about the movie. The viewer can choose to listen to their conversation running under the movie and from this, he is treated to an insider look at the making of this movie. From the choice of camera angles to special effects to dealing with a very limited money and time budget--it's all there. I enjoyed the movie when I first saw it but the DVD really makes it a complete experience."
3,"Not great, but interseting","This movie took a serious hit by fans and critics, and I'll admit that B.E. is extremely cheesy(your enjoyment of this film will be based on your movie cheese tolerance). With all that said, I found myself enjoying it. I like the way that the Psychlos were portrayed and the look of the film is spectacular. Everything is shot at an angle, and I actually started liking that aspect as well. If you like ID4 and Godzilla, then you might want to check this one out. Personally I feel that this film is better than Mission to Mars and Red Planet, because it is what it is and doesn't try to be anything other than a B grade sci-fi, and for that I have to tip my hat. There is an interseting final solution for getting rid of the bad guys that I felt was original. Lastly, I also feel that too many people bashed this movie because of the Scientology backing, and that is a shame."
3,Hard to Rate,"This movie is so awful that is is awesome.First off, I read the book first. Also, I really like a lot of L. Ron Hubbard's books, my favorite being the Mission Earth series.I digress. If you liked the book Battlefield Earth, you'll find the movie lacking of the connection to the plot & characters. The movie is like a cheap bad wine. You know it is bad but eventually you'll drink it because you don't have any better wine and you don't feel like leaving the house.When this day happens and you watch the movie, you'll agree with everyone else that the movie is, possibly, the worst film ever. However, if you do happen to have that cheap bottle of wine laying around; pop the cork and enjoy the movie for being so terrible. The camera angles are more than over-the-top and would make a sober person dizzy. Might as well enjoy the wine and laugh at an awfully awesome film."
3,Worst move ever?,"Alright, if you look beyond the outrageous caveman flying Harrier jets and the odd way man made objects like the guns and jets still work after 1,000 years, it's a pretty good movie. I have heard complaints about this movie as if it's hard to belive the human race could fall against alien invaders (Like how humanity beat all odds in Independance Day). I have seen it at the theaters and then read the book and trust me, after reading that, I think the movie could have been better. But given what the director and producer John Travolta had to work with, I'd applaud for their effort and putting togeather such a good action movie. I wish the movie had done better than it did. This only covers about half the book and could really use a sequel."
1,What Book Did John T Read????,"The only things that the book and the movie had in common was the Name of the book, Teryl, Ker, Johnie Goodboy Tyler, Chrissie, Earth and Denver. The rest of this Fiasco had nothing to do with the book I read. The story I read was dramatic,entertaining and thoughtful.This Hollywood attempt to make this movie entertaining failed in my opinion. Yes I know Hollywood has to make allowances to make movies within a budget, But this one should have been left on the book shelf."
1,"Nonsense, nonsense, and more.........","I rented the DVD of this film yesterday so I could see first-hand how bad this film was, and can only say that there was NOTHING redeeming about it whatsoever. The screenplay, special effects, acting, and everything else was simply sub-par. I am still debating If I should listen to Roger Christian's director commentary, but I don't know If I can sit through this film for another two hours. Besides, what could he possibly say that would justify this travesty? A waste of talent, time, and lots of MONEY. Geez, as horrible as Michael Bay is (Yes, he is BAD), at least the special effects are up to snuff despite the absence of everything else that makes a decent film."
3,Surprisingly enjoyable.,"Battlefield Earth surprised me immensely. Sure, it's got a lot of hokey and absurd moments, along with a lot of plot holes and logic flaws, but no more so than Kevin Costner's post-apocalyptic films, and they're considerably more dull than Battlefield Earth, which is a movie that's quite dumb, but is a lot of fun to watch. The sets are amazing to look at, with the ruins of Denver and Washington, D.C. a truly dazzling sight. The lead performance from Barry Pepper is quite good, and while the rest of the supporting cast isn't, Pepper handles the weight quite well and gets some help from two hilarious over-the-top performances from John Travolta and Forest Whitaker. The action scenes are decent, but suffer too much slow motion and fast editing. Still, this is an enjoyable treat and I really wouldn't mind a sequel."
4,Where did it lose reality for you?,"The movie was fun and refreshing, the dvd is excellent. I was disapointed in the sci fi fans that didnt give this movie a chance, most of the people that shot it down hadn't even seen it."
2,A Poor Attempt,"I really didn't think that anyone could do worse than David Lynch did when he made the first Dune film, but this attempt at making a movie from Hubbard's book is a near total disaster. It makes me wonder if the script writer, the director, the producer, etc even took the time to READ the book.Take some of the cash you might be thinking of outlaying for this DVD and buy the book. It's a much better story!!"
2,Definitely not good... but not so bad.,"The story is terrible. As many have pointed out, the plot holes are many and huge. But, the acting is not so bad. And the alien, Terl, played by John Travolta is actually an interesting character and a villain you could love to hate. But the character falls flat in the latter part of the movie. The alien Psychlos are much more interesting than the heroic human characters. When the story revolves around the duplicitous Psychlos, the movie is actually fun. One does need an enormous suspension of disbelief to accept this movie as serious science fiction. So forget that. But as a send up, probably unintentional, it stands alongside ""Independence Day."" I enjoyed the movie. It is fun in spots, terrible in others and borders on boring in the last quarter. But I don't regret watching it. It is certainly not the worst movie ever made. But a lot of people have thoroughly enjoyed poking fun at it. Why not watch it and join the fun?"
3,I liked it,"OK, some parts of the movie were....OK, I'll say it....stupid. :-)Honestly......it's still a pretty good movie.Plot: 3 out of 5 stars: Alien race conquers mankind and subjugates them. Man stages a comeback...tadaaaaa!Cast and Acting: 3 out of 5 stars: A few big names....Travolta being one and few nobody's. The acting was OK, some of the lines were impossible to pull off in my opinion. :-) The script was very ""Invader Zim"" and ""Almighty Tall"" - ish. :-)Special effect: A bit cheezy but, bearable.Still.....I couldn't give it only 1 star....I though it was better than that."
2,Plan 9 from Outta Space.....the remake,"Battlefield Earth is a laughable Star Wars wannabe starring John Travolta as an evil alien that is just about as scary as Spaceball's Dark Helmet. Travolta might as well do Look Who's Talking 4 after this. If you want to see Travolta as a villain you can take seriously, then I recommend Broken Arrow, Face Off or even Swordfish. In this he has nothing to do but laugh every 30 seconds and to call Barry Pepper ""Rat Brain"" - yes, ""Rat Brain!"" through most the movie. From what I hear, Travolta wants to do sequels; well, to that I think I'll say what his character in this would say: ""Ha Ha Ha Ha!"""
1,"Dear God, NO!!!","While I am NOT a follower of L. Ron Hubbard, I have to admit that I love his book that this movie (?) is based on. I don't know if it is the all time worst book-to-movie out there, but it is definitely in the bottom five. The screenplay barely even gives a nod to the book and the acting was pretty gruesome. If you have read the book and not seen the movie, save yourself some time and money. I was really looking forward to the movie; then I saw it and almost threw up.Like I said, not the all time worst, but definitely in the top five."
2,Deja-vu.,"I have a feeling of deja-vu. The fate of the geosynchronous Ra in Stargate, for instance. Psychlos have a tendency to lose their tempers, start yelling in incomprehensible gutteral vowels and shoot at people. Luckily, they have landed in America. This is an endearingly preposterous film so I don't have the heart to give it just the one star."
2,"Bad, but watchable...","Well, I saw BE today, it's a good laying around the house on a Saturday afternoon (with a Friday night hangover) kind of movie, campy, yes, bad script and effects, yes, but entertaining, none the less, oh...why weren't the ""rat lovers"" wearing oxygen masks while piloting the jet fighters? oh, well..."
3,A Big Budget B movie.,"This science fiction adventure centers on a final battle between good and evil for control of the world. In the year 3000, Earth is ruled by the Psyclos, a vicious alien race, led by the tyrant Terl played by John Travolta, that has laid waste to the planet, killed the majority of the population, and stripped Earth of its valuable resources. Pockets of resistance remain among the surviving humans; the hero, Jonnie Tyler, is one such rebel, living in hiding in the mountains. Eventually, Johnny begins organizing like-minded humans for a final stand against the Psyclos. The movie covers only the first half of Hubbard's book."
1,Rent before you buy,"There are not many movies I have switched off after the first 30 minutes, but this is one of them, and I recommend you rent this one first before you buy or else you might have a nasty surprise."
3,I heard the worst . . ..,"I heard the worst of this film so I didn't expect much. I was still a bit surprised by the overacting by John Travolta and Forest Whittaker. However, overall, the film wasn't that bad. Maybe it's my low expectations that allow me to say that. Or it could be that I bear this film no resentment as I rented it for only fifty cents from the library. Be that as it may, I found the movie entertaining. It's based on an interesting idea and I liked the ending."
1,They must have channeled Ed Wood,"This is the only post-1970s movie I have seen that actually approximates the so-bad-it's-hilarious, campy feel of the old 1950s sci-fi cheapies. What really makes it is that the people who created it obviously had no clue how to do this sort of stuff, or how incredibly awful it really was. You can't make a film this bad on purpose. Forget the ""awesome"" special effects and tired post-Blade Runner my-kid's-messy-room production design and immerse yourself in the patently ridiculous plot, dialogue, makeup, and characterizations (especially Travolta's). I haven't laughed this hard at ANY movie in years. Highly recommended."
1,1 horrendous movie that deserves 0 stars,"A crime against L. Ron Hubbard's book, Battlefield Earth, has been committed in the guise of Battlefield Earth, the movie. I spent the whole movie, eyes glued to the TV, telling everybody ""No, this is nothing like the book! The book is great and this is awful"". The characters were flat and some were not at all as written. Most of the characters in the book never made an appearance in the movie. The plot had only the vaguest resemblance to the book.I wondered how they could make a good movie from a book that is 1050 pages long. Now I know they just took the name and trashed the rest. I was amazed that L. Ron Hubbard did not come back from the dead to sue them for destroying his work. The book is GREAT, read it but avoid the movie like the plague!"
1,"Horrible, Tedious, Unfunny Jetsam, Not Even Pitiable.","This movie makes the Anna Nicole Smith show seem like high entertainment. There was not one good thing about this pathetic starship crash of a movie, except maybe for when the end credits rolled.No, check that. The credits were horrid, too.Now, can you publish this review the way it was written this time?"
1,"Damn You, John Travolta","Hi, my name is Dan and I have suffered through a traumatic experience. While at a friends house, I turned to this movie thinking it would be a likable enough diversion. Man, was i wrong. It was awful beyond the point of so bad its good. I never thought a movie could ever be painful, but Battlefiel Earth was. I have since checked myself into rehab."
1,"So so so so so so so BAD, you must see it to believe!","This is tied for the worst movie I have ever seen. The plot is incomprehensible, the characters range from shallow to forgettable. The special effects are bad, the camera work is dizzying. It is a bad film.You should absolutely rent this now and watch it tonight. I consider it an educational experience. We must subject ourselves to this torture so that we as a race do not repeat our past mistakes and put out something this poor ever again. Bring alcohol."
1,syfy channel originals bad,"i think most people who watched this movie over exaggerated how bad it is. i mean, it is bad, but not the worst movie of all time. i'd say it's no worse than a syfy channel original movie. the villains of the movie seem like they're made for a childrens sci fi movie. the movie is set in the year 3000, which is 1000 years after humans were defeated by an alien race whose technology seems less advanced than ours."
2,This is Travolta's 'Passion of the Christ'.,Imagine someone combining the scripts for Zardoz and Independence Day and letting a troupe of inebriated special education students control the acting and directing....then you would have Battlefield Earth.It is so bad it actually has some entertainment value which elevates it to two stars.You become mesmerized as you sit back and consider that this is the end result of John Travolta putting his heart and soul into a project.Just awful. If Battlefield Earth and Pluto Nash were humans they would deserve to be executed.
1,Is this the best Travolta Could Do?,"I have to agree that this is no worse than a lot of grade B sci-fi films starting from the 1930s until today, but as the supposed grand work by a supposedly Grand Master the book and this film has a lot to answer for. The first point is that it is not original. The supposedly ""special effects that are completely real"" ain't. (The ruined cities looked, for the most part, like cheap matte shots.) Finally, John Revoltin' Travolta is so strange looking that the fear that hostile aliens should create is lost. It is also another cheap shot at the Mental Health community that Scientologists love to throw out.In short, this is for nights when there is nothing to do and you are so desperate for something (anything actually) to watch or (worse) read."
1,How Disappointing!,"I saw a portion of this movie at the theater - it is the only movie I have ever left. I am a movie buff, John Travolta fan, love science-fiction, and am easily amused. I have learned to never expect anything, then I am not disappointed BUT I do expect a little more than this movie gave: bad acting, poor story-line, dirty, dull settings. . . Definitely rent it before you buy. It doesn't even qualify as a bad ""B"" movie."
4,"You stupid man-animal, watch this movie!","The only thing that stunk about this movie was the ending. The jetplanes the cavemen used were way too old to be operational. I enjoy good camp, but logic holes that are too big usually detract from the suspension of disbelief this type of movie should inspire. Other than this I would give it five stars.The movie was actually enjoyable and funny. The scenes of wasted Denver were neat. The actors fit the roles. Travolta played a great comedic villain. I can't say enough for the FX - outstanding. And the plot wasn't half bad either.The critics bashed this a lot harder than they should have. It's not the best movie ever made, but it's enjoyable."
5,Brilliant Family Entertainment,"As a movie, it was and is the most insightful human drama sinceWaterworld and I am personally shocked that anyone would not see it as the classic it truely is. I Think Ronald wrote a good story"
3,Okay Nasty Alien World,John Travolta had a weird accent in this but it ws okay. I didn't like the humans so much. It was like Planet of the Apes sometimes but the nasty cut throat Alien Race was good and strong and I hadn't seen them before but they are a little like Klingons. It was a hero story and did not have any real surprises.
2,COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER...,"THIS FILM COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER, THERE ARE VERY FEW THINGS GOOD ABOUT THIS FILM, THE CAST FOR INSTENSE... I THOUGHT JOHN TRAVOLTA DID MARVOLOUS AS THE STAR AND THE VILLIAN, HIS SINISTER PRESENCE DOES QUITE WELL ALTHOUGH COULD HAVE BEEN EXPANDED BETTER, I LOVE BARRY PEPPER, HE IS AN ACTOR TO LOOK OUT FOR IN THE FUTURE, I LOVED HIM IN 61, AND IN THE RECENT 25TH HOUR. FOREST WHITIKER WAS GOOD AS THE PUSHED AROUND HENCHMAN, BELEIVE IT OR NOT THIS WAS THE FIRST FILM I SAW HIM IN... SAD HUH...ESPECIALLY FOR SUCH A GREAT ACTOR OF THE CRYING GAME AND THE RECENT PHONE BOOTH.BUT OVERALL... COULD HAVE BEEN THE NEXT STAR WARS... IF THEY TRIED HARDER... AND MADE IT LESS GRIM."
3,"Do ""not"" be a sheep and believe the critics, it ""is"" good...","Good, ignore everyone else. Eventhough the graphics are not as good as star wars the film is still good. I do not know what it is with people and this film they seem to hate it. Is it because of john travolta's laugh that is suposed to be that way but people just dont get that or is it the fact humans become dum after""2000"" years of no education ? This film is good!"
3,Read the book. PLEASE!,"This movie is obviously not a great movie. I was however intrigued by the notion of a post apocalyptic Earth where man rediscovers his past. I went to the library and checked out the over 1,000 page book ""Battlefield Earth"". I read it over the summer and LOVED IT. The book is a million times better than the movie and the movie would anger anyone who enjoyed the book. The only good thing about the movie was to see everything come to life. So watch the movie, get a laugh, make fun of it all you want, but then read the book."
4,Better than most,"I don't know why the critics didn't like this film. They seem to have latched on to the smallest details and then gone insane over them. These are usually the same people who loved Phantom Menace!! Oh, come on. People keep bringing up these things which they claim are plot holes but in fact I have been able to explain every single one of them.My brother and I both agree that this was a fun film and that it was definitely very entertaining. The special effects were excellent and the story kept you engaged. I can't say the same thing about Phantom Menace.I highly recommend this film to sci-fi fans and those that can let go and enjoy a good fantasy film."
2,Not as bad as you might think,"I had trepidations, to say the least, after reading comments on Amazon, but for $ 15.00, what the heck. Yes, it's dumb. Yes, Travolta looks silly. But the visuals are good -- really good.The hard part is trying to figure out if this was a serious effort, or if it's tongue in cheek.It isn't great, but it sure isn't the worst movie ever made."
3,Definitely different,"Although some of the technical details left something to be desired (learning to fly Harriers in a few days???) I thought that it was a nice change for John Travolta. Why can't he play a completely different character??? What is wrong with that?? Although the movie was not Oscar material, it proved that actors can play roles outside of their usual genre. Yeah! for Travolta trying something different!"
1,"Horrible beyond description, but you should see it.","When I walked into the video store to rent this vid, the guy at the counter said ""I heard that this was a really bad movie..."" I looked him squarely in the eye and told him ""Yeah- I've heard that this is the WORST movie ever made- that's why I need to see it.""Comparisons between ""Battlefield Earth"" and Ed Wood's ""Plan 9"" are inappropraite. Plan 9 was so bad that it was actually fun to watch- Battlefield Earth, however, is sorta like watching a close-up video of eye surgery- however, this film's abysmal awfulness is unique, in its own way...The shock of the horrible acting, cheesy costumes, terrible direction, and puke-inducing cinematography never wears off- just when you think your intelligence and sense of aesthetics cannot be further insulted, this movie slams you again- and again- and again.This is a film to be endured, rather than enjoyed- if you can survive a viewing, you'll feel stronger for it."
1,Sci-Fi fans beware!,"I realize their are very few good Sci-Fi films for the serious and mature viewer,(2001, the 1st 3 Star Wars films, Alien, Bladerunner, etc.) but this movie should be avoided at all costs. Rarely has a film come along that has less going for it than this one. It has no redeeming qualities in any category. The direction, the screenplay, the acting, the special effects, and the costumes reveal an ineptitude on a scale never before acheived in the history of cinema, or mankind for that matter. Who could have thought any of this was a good idea? Well, if you know anything about the author of the novel that provides the source material, enough said. I have never seen a worse film, nor do I care to. I declare this the winner!"
3,...,"When I spend money on a DVD I expect to get the movie, the whole movie, not an edited version. It says on the front of my DVD ""Special Edition"" but the Amazon[.com] picture of the front cover fails to mention this. There are lots of data about all the extras you get but they fail to mention that the movie is cut. In the small print on the back of my DVD box it says ""Edited for home video"". Now they tell me.The only redeeming feature of this film is it's humor and they edited it out. At the same time we lost the humor they made Terl just not as demonic as he really is. If you want to see the movie in entirety, try to catch it on TV."
1,Worst movie ever!,"Can I give it negative stars?This movie does not do the book justice. Do you want to know how to turn the best sci-fi book written into the worst movie ever, do you like plot holes, do you like bad acting, if you do you'll love this movie. Travolta's biggest mistake. Don't waste your time."
1,Battlefield Earth mistreated on DVD as well,"One of my all-time favorite books gets destroyed as a movie. One always hopes that it will be given justice and yet it comes out worse than you could possibly imagine. This is to be a review of the DVD, however, and it was even worse than the theatrical release. Sure they added some decent bonus features, but it is also the only ""special edition"" in all of DVD Land that cut the film! ""Edited for Home Video"" is just plain nonsense and stupidity. Other manufacturers give you more film and added scenes, but Warner Brothers released a ""cut"" version. In retrospect, maybe we should be glad the torture was decreased, but somehow the shock of an edited DVD still has not diminished."
1,"Hideous, Absolutely hideous","This is quite possibly the worst science fiction film ever made, and it shows up on quite a few of the lists of that subject. I wrote this review simply to rate this movie low and hopefully warn innocent movie viewers away from it."
1,An excruciatingly bad movie,"I almost felt pain at watching this. I had heard stories but nothing prepares you for the horror of how bad this movie actually is. John Travolta, Forrest Whittaker, Barry Pepper...all good to very good actors, in a stinkbomb of a movie. At least ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" was so bad it was funny..."
1,Trash Science Fiction,"Truly one of the worst sci-fi movies ever made. The goofiest of the 1950s science fiction movies would be Oscar material compared to this rag of a film. Everything in this movie is appallingly bad: the script, the acting, the special effects, the plot: everything. If the aliens in the story were so intelligent, then they would have found Fort Knox a long time ago. If the aliens were really intelligent they would have known that Fort Knox has been pretty empty ever since the US dollar was removed from the gold standard in the 60s. Somehow humans couldn't overcome these aliens when they were at the peak of their technology but are able to do it when they're living in caves? Please. Unless you want to watch this as a comedy, trust me, don't waste your time and money on this joke film: you won't miss a thing."
1,How bad could it be?,"I bought this film because I did not believe it could be as bad as everybody said. After all, WaterWorld turned out to have some redeeming concepts and nice scenery. But, geeze, this movie is bad! I mean, how could Hollywood throw that much money at anything and have it be so silly and dull? Not one appealing character. .... I was not able to make it to the end. Uncle!"
1,One of the worst movies of all time!,"Terrible acting, unbelievable storyline, ridiculous ""aliens"" (John Travolta on stilts with dreadlocks! Ok, I laughed at that part!), simpleminded plot, humans that go from stone age to fighter pilots overnight... the list goes on. I always thought Plan 9 from Outer Space had to be the worst movie of all time but it's got Battlefield Earth beat!This isn't even a Camp or Cult film, it's just BAD!"
1,"wow, I can't believe a movie can be this horrible","To quote my good friend's uncle ""Battlefield Earth was crap"" I don't need to say much more about this god-awful movie except that it's perfect for a laugh if you are down."
5,My 13-year-old son loved it.,"My 13-year-old son loved it.A great movie.No.A fun movie?Yes.Travolta is great as Teri and Berry Pepper captures the spirit,determination and courage of the hero,Johnny.The special effects were fabulous.The dog fight scene between the Psychlo's and the US is too cool."
3,Its just not that bad.,"You know, I read the book about 15 years ago, and really liked it. Long before I ever heard about sciencetology. I dont know anying about scientology, but I dont see how this movie, or the book for that matter, could have anything to do with it. Its got a fair story with rather good special effects."
4,Better Still,The re-editing and newly added footage have done a lot for the film. I was impressed with the results! I have seen the DVD version twice now and enjoyed it a lot. It is particularly great for the 13 and under crowd. Much fun!
2,It's worth watching just to see Travolta TRY,"Go ahead and rent it if you like Sci-Fi and like Travolta (even at his worst) and all the other movies are checked out. I actually rented it tonight for those reasons. I started laughing as soon as I saw Travolta's character on the cover, and I knew I had to see it. It was apparent from the start that it was going to be bad.It'll keep you entertained for the length of the movie--there's enough action for that. But check your brain at the door as you watch ignorant human cave dwellers flying fully functional combat planes on fully functional fuel after just a few days in a fully functional simulator."
4,Enjoyable humor,"I liked the humor and irony of the Battlefieldfield Earth movie so I was pleased even more when I watched the DVD. Take the scene where Jonnie and his cohorts find the bomb in the underground shelter and are trying to figure out its workings. The interaction between the characters and their ineptness with 20th century technology is great fun. It's added tidbits like this, that make the DVD a good buy."
1,"There's bad, and then there's Battlefield Earth","If your asking yourself how bad could it possibly be, it's worse! I am embarrassed for John Travolta (who does nothing but laugh for the whole two painful hours). The special effects look worse then something off the sci-fi channel. The plot, if you want to call it that, is incomprehensible. Don't these movies get screened before they're put into theaters? It's so incomprehensibly bad that it's worth a viewing, because no words could describe it to you."
5,Battlefield Earth,I like this movie. I don't know why it has such a low rating. Mankind fighting to save ourselves from aliens that have conquered many world's. Kind of like Independence Day.
1,Probably the worst movie ever made,One of the worst movies ever made to one of the best books ever written.
3,Big Production Values on a tight budget,"Considering the actual production budget for Battlefield Earth-- apparently far less than the bloated figure protrayed by the usual Hollywood hype-- the values on the screen are impressive. If commentaries by director Roger Christian and designer Patrick Tatopolous are an index, some astonishingly complex effects were achieved on an inordinately --by Babylon-on- the-Pacific standards-- tight budget. Travolta's performance was, for me, stylishly over-the-top-- a consciously extravagantshow by a genuinely gifted actor."
4,Soon To Be A Classic,"The more times I see this movie, the more I like it. It's deep and you've got to pay attention but it's an excellent story with excellent acting. It reminds me of Dune which when it first came out was panned but today it's a classic and millions of people love it. I think this movie will have the same results in the end."
3,Not Great But Good,The movie is good and as always Amazon shines. Product was delivered in a tiely fashion and in good condition.
3,"3 and a half stars,A cool science fiction movie","Lots of people said this movie is the worst movie ever,it is not the worst movie ever it has a good plot aliens and slaves take over and battle.John Travolta does a alright job as Terl,the evil ruler of the slaves,while Forest Whitaker,Barry Pepper,and Kelly Preston give alright performances.Battlefield Earth is the best sci/fi movie since Species,Aliens,and Red Planet.the DVD and VHS are alright with extras on the DVD,but on back of the DVD and VHS it says edited for home video,it edits the funny moments from TV,so record or watch it on TV,L. Ron Hubbard adapted this movie from his book."
1,Message for Jean-Luc:,"I hope you're joking, I really do. For if you aren't then I will personally come to your house and beat the living sense into you.I too though that this would be a kick-a** sci-fi action flick, but I warn everybody out there: DON'T SEE IT! If you're into campy classics like Ed Wood films or Showgirls, then go ahead, I even dare you collectors of bad trash to buy it. But if you appriciate good cinema or have any faith in Jesus Christ whatsoever, then stay away from this one. It's considered one of the worst films of all time."
3,NOT THE BEST BUT STILL WATCHABLE,"I will be the first to admit this is not the best movie I have seen, but it was good. I think it would have done better if it had been done futuristic. I would hate to think that by the year 3000 we have declined back to knowing nothing. I would watch this movie again and plan on buying it. I have seen a lot worse movies that I had to make myself finish but I did not feel that way with this movie!"
1,"Battlefield Earth , what more can be said?","This movie single-handedly has the ability to question the existence of God himself for why would God even allow this film to be made. If God re-wrote his commandments he would include the following suggestion, "" Thou shall not part way with thy money to rent, own Battlefield Earth. He among us so eager to watch this movie deserves to be in hell"". Actually sitting thru this film gives you a real good indication of what hell feels like."
1,It's really that bad!,"And that just might be an understatement. If there was any way of rating this movie 0 stars, I would have... Here's the story in a nuttshell... The alliens took over the world (naturally). About 50 alliens (that's how many I've counted) run the earth, and exploit it. A bunch of postapocalyptic cavemen who managed to survive for a thousand years on a polluted planet decide that they've had enough. So they wipe the dust off 1000 years old airplanes, and kick some allien butt, destrying the alliens' home planet while they're at it... I'm really disappointed that Forrest Whitaker accepted a role in this film... For the most part of the movie I wasn't too sure whether I was watching SF or a parody... If you prefer the latter, might I suggest the ""Spaceballs""? :))"
1,Worst movie ever made,Worst of the worst. Watch paint dry.It will be cheaper and less painful. You wonder how they could get funding to make this pic. I'm surprise Travolta or Whitaker were ever offered any more roles
3,Watch it with your buds...but not with the wife,"As with all things Hubbard, Asimov, or Moe Curly & Larry... Women just don't get it. My Wife sat through it begrudgingly and was considerate enough to wait till the movie was over to tell me she did not like it. As I see it the difference is this: Men Enjoy the entertainment value, While Women seek a deeper meaning that just isn't there. Call us Simpletons if you will ladies, But we just don't need a deeper meaning to be entertained. On the Other hand, I have a particular fondness for Sci-Fi and enjoyed the story, even though it offers little explanation of how a near-neanderthal individual learns to fly a Harrier Jump Jet in only two weeks...Is this typical of L. Ron Hubbard or just poor moviemaking? I'll let you decide. I reccomend this selection on DVD also for the extras. It gives a little background info on the Novel, and provides bios about the cast."
2,Restore Its Original Length,"The movie I saw at the theater was so different from the chop and hack version I saw released later for the home. No wonder no one likes it. Yes, you must suspend belief, it really does have huge stretches. But until I saw this movie on VHS I really did not understand the revulsion.Re-issue this in its uncut version and a few more people will find it acceptable, or at least mildly amusing. The best parts were cut from the original."
2,Travolta stepped in it this time!,"John Travolta's character: Klingon after too many rounds of drinks. Am I right?Did anyone else have an old Buick with a dragging muffler that sounded like those space ships? And of course, the miracle of savages learning to pilot fighter planes like Chuck Yeager! From spears to joystick. Amazing! And God bless the director. Apparently allowing John and the boys to go get hammered in the morning and do the acting stuff in the afternoon. I think it must have been ghost directed by Kevin Cosner.John and Forrest: we fans forgive you! After Pulp Fiction and The Crying Game you guys have earned at least a couple of stinkers each. Besides, we Mystery Science Theater 3000 Fans are used to much worse. Er, make that equally worse. When L. Ron is done spinning in his grave you can continue making movies!"
3,Missing scenes,"I give the DvD 3 stars for only one reason Parts of the movie are gone. I went a saw the movie opening weekend in hopes that it would be as good as the book ( which it wasnt ) Got the DVD and watched it with my family and felt the movie was better after I accepted the fact in wasnt as good as the book, watched it a 2nd time at home and noticed parts were missing. The main part was the first bar scene wher Terl was telling the bartender he was going to submit the report and he wasnt his friend. Maybe I did something wrong watching, but still [upset]"
1,The Truth About 'Battlefield Earth',"Yes, 'Battlefield Earth' is absolutely terrible and laughable, but it perhaps has an excessively grave reputation. A major-release movie this bad comes out pretty much every year. The best parts are John Travolta's legendary performances and the numerous, hilarious wipes. I was waiting for them to pull out the star wipe, but alas, twas not to be. Still, ridiculous though it is, it wasn't boring, which is the only utterly fatal flaw a movie can have. What can I say, I went to see this movie with a group of friends and we had a good time. True, we were laughing at the movie rather than with it, but that's more than you can do for some films. 'Dungeon & Dragons' for example.Grade: F"
1,One of the worst movie of all times. Zero star.,Everything about this film is bad. The special effects and make up look so bad it's funny. The acting is way below par. The action scenes are like cartoon.What a waste of time and money.
1,Nothing redeming in this one. A stinker. Whoa!,I did not think watching any movie could be painful until I saw this one. I kept tilting my head to one side or the other to be able to see the picture. Then my neck started huting. I kept squinting my eyes to make out the images more clearly until I realized they we our of focus. After 15 minutes I stopped watching and went to take some medicine to calm my stomach. This is absolutely the worst. How did it even make it to the box office?
1,Will movies never match their respective books?,Amazon resells reviews and you don't get a dime from it!
5,"Great movie, better book","The movie was very good I thought, very interesting. You had to look over a few fake parts, only what a true movie watcher can do, and the movie was great! It left out about half the book, which is excellent, but it is a good job of cramming 1050 pages of excitement into 100 minutes. A defenite see, if not a buy. Watch it first, as most people (some how) seem not to like it that much. If you are watching it for just a good time and a good movie without criticizing it, then this is a movie for you!"
4,Great lacing toy for toddlers,"We bought this when my daughter was a year and a half and it was a little above her abilities at the time. She is now 2 and loves it and is learning how to lace very well. It's a great toy for the car and that is where we keep some of them. She also likes looking at the different animals and making the animals sound (quack quack, moo moo). The quality is good, she has chewed on it a little and there are teeth marks, but that is the nature of foam :) Overall, I recommend this toy for ages 2 and up."
5,Beautiful Thoughts,We had this music on a cassette tape and lost it. I was so excited to find it again and are AGAIN enjoying it over and over. Soft soothing music without being new agey. We're delighted to have it in our lives again. We have three grandchildren living with us now and it offers relief from the stressful times. It even calms them down. The pieces are written by David Combs and performed by Gary Prim. Simple beauty.
4,"Good bag, misleading picture","I have been using this bag for about a year now in my diaper pail (which is a 24qt sterilite rectangular garbage can). It gets washed regularly and while occasionally it does feel dampish on the outside when full of diapers, it hasn't caused any problems. I did want to point out that the bag isn't ""vertical"" like how it looks in the picture. The opening is actually along the longer edge so it's slightly strange and squat. We had a hard time finding a pail/bin in which it would fit without falling into it with the weight of the diapers."
2,Not satisfied...bag leaks,"I was not satisfied at all with this bag. It was not tall like it shows in the picture, it is short and wide. It also leaks. I am using it for cloth diapers in a diaper pail and it does not contain the wetness in the bag. When i picked the bag up out of the pail it was dripping. I will definitely be purchasing a different wetbag that will actually hold all the wetness inside. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
3,do the job,"The bags came very fast! I got the large and small bags. The large bag is in a 5 gallon pail, and it fits fine. It is a lot smaller then what I thought it would be. Go larger if you want to fit more then about 10 diapers in the bag."
3,good enough,"This bag, is great for it's waterproofness, and if you stick in a can with a lid, it does a great job of hiding odor. My only complaints are that this is their ""large"" and their cost of shipping (~$20 for 2!!). I have twins...I have something different in my mind for a ""large bag."" This holds about one day's worth of diapers for me. I was hoping to be able to go for about 2-3 days, so I'm not running down to the laundry every day. If these complaint don't bother you, try it out. I have one, and was going to buy two more, but for the ridiculous price of shipping, I said ""forget it."" I'll find a regular laundry bag."
3,Angie at her best!,"I really like this album; this is the first time that I can say that about an album by the talented Ms. Stone as a whole. Black Diamond and Mahogany Soul, always felt like they where missing something to me, though I knew it wasn't in the vocals of Angie Stone. The LP has a very focused feel, which complements Angie's sound. If you own any Angie Stone album, Stone Love is definitely the album to get."
2,2 1/2,Not her best. Come on Angie I know you can blow show us that voice and make us proud. Angie can sin and the production is good...just not heartfelt
2,Corperate Middle of the Road R&B,"Angie Stone gets dap from me for Hanging around as long as she has&Bringing in Acts over the years.She is a Industry Pro&Knows the Game. but Musically She is to R&B what Black Eye Peas is to Rap to Me:something a Corperate Suit put together fully.Everybody takes from others,but my thing with Angie Stone is that Her Jacking never showcases Her.She can do Runs on Hooks&also match the Stylings of whomever she is Biting but She has no real Idenity as a Artist to me.she has Soulful Runs without having soulful Feeling In Her Music&that especially runs through here.there a couple cool cuts but on a whole this has Boardroom soul written all over it."
2,Not very good,This album is not as good as previous Angie's albums but there are 3 or 4 good tracks.
2,Stone Dud!,"Stone Love is way below average in comparison to Angie's previous cd's. The only tracks that vow for my attention are ""I Wanna Thank Ya"" (tight track that Snoop adds flavor to), ""Lovers' Ghetto"", and ""You're Gonna Get It"". Gone are the funky rhythms and savvy lyrics. This is a huge disappointment, not even the guest appearances by Floetry, Betty Wright, Snoop, and Anthony Hamilton can save this project."
4,"Excellent CD, but iPod users beware","Great music cd, but product has Windows DRM and may not be compatible with the iPod. See (...) before purchasing"
5,Angie is rollin',"Angie Stone has always been my favortie soulstress and this album proves how she keeps redeeming herself after long pauses. When I listen to this cd I get lost in the songs because they are all something the females can relate to not just fairy tell stories. I am very proud on her comeback after Mohagony Soul. If you don't have her latest yet you heard it from me to go out and get it. Keep doin your thing Angie, I support you all the way!!!!!"
5,Angie Shines.........,"Wow my 2nd favorite cd of 2004...I was so happy to here that Angie was back w/ new material...This cd was hot but as usual a ""Slept on Classic""...I don't understand why great music flops and fake/toned deaf music sells...i guess this will always be something I don't understand...but anyway Angie shines on this cd and shows why she is the ""Neo Soul Queen""...I hope you go out and give Ms. Stone a chance because I promise you will not be disappointed...and I can't wait for her next cd!!!!!"
4,The Real Deal-don't sleep on her,"Angie is my girl and her CD is worth the money. Musically, she has the complete package and her voice is incredible. This CD has something for everyone. I love the cuts: I wanna thank ya, U-Haul and Cinderella Ballin""....please check her out and you won't be sorry. She's smart to duet with Anthony Hamilton(another excellent CD), the master Betty Wright and Snoop Dogg.She has been truly blessed."
5,OUTSTANDING!!!,"There are no words to tell ya how enjoyable this CD is!!! If you thought that the last CD was great, buckle your seatbelt. My favorit songs on this CD starts at track 4 thru 17 (IT'S THAT AWESOME). This CD is the definition of real R&B, easy listening music. BUY IT U WANT BE SORRY!!! Thanks Angie for keeping it real.Cheryl of OKC"
4,Loving Stone Love,"This album is one of the best albums of 2004, other than Jill Scott's album, this one was in my cd player at all times. I love Angie, she is one of my favorite singers. But this isn't her best album, in my opinon. It was great and I really enjoyed it but its kind of hard to top two great albums, and she came really close. I really love Mahagony Soul(best album) and Black Diamond. This album's standout track was, You Don't Love Me, it is breezy and easy to listen to. Don't miss out on her albums all of them are great."
3,Ms. Stone is still on top,"I liked more songs on this album than Mahogony Soul. But I have to say this one is a little more commercialized for lack of a better word. It is a little more Hip Hop. Missy Elliots lyricks UHAUL were the best for me. I agree with the previous reviewer about Badu, Scott and others. But give MS. STONE her props she can blow although on this album she doesnt show it as much. She is great live. Overall its worth adding to your collection"
2,Disappointed,"As an Angie Stone fan, I was anxiously awaiting this release. I loved Mohangany Soul and liked her first cd very much. Stone Love is a major disappointment and is mediocre at best. There are no stand-out cuts; nothing that I felt the desire to hear again. Save your money; you aren't missing anything. Better luck next time."
4,Better and Better,"Angie's third release ""Stone Love"" finds the veteran releasing her best yet. The lead off single ""I wanna thank ya"" is a slamming first single and could do without Snoop Dogg's verse. The rolling groove and Stone's simple lyrics are enough to make it a hit.Other strong tracks are the Missy Elliot produced ""U-Haul"", ""Lover's Ghetto"" (which samples Dynasty's ""Adventures in the land of music), and the stirring ""Come home (live with me)""Betty Wright makes an appearance on ""That kind of love"". Wright has also appeared with Stone on releases by Joss Stone and Nina Sky.Another strong cut is ""Cinderella Ballin'"". Angie Stone posses a smoky and soulful voice full of range. She doesnt always use it and that could be the downfall of this release as she never brings things to a climax and it leaves you wanting more from her vocally. Whatever the case this album is among the best released in 2004."
5,Solid As Stone!,"""Stone Love"" shows Angie in a new light as the reigning hero of neo-soul. She explores more hip-hop than she usually do, but puts it down better than any other. You want a good listen, get this album! You won't be disappointed.Song highlights: Lover's Ghetto, You're Gonna Get It, Remy Red, Cinderella Ballin"
5,Angie Stone is the Bomb!!!,"I honestly have to say that Angie Stone is the most underated singer out there today. The CD Stone Love is phenomenal even even though I prefer her prior cd Mahogany Soul. It's amazing how people think that people who sing off-tune like Ashanti are talented and critize real talents like Angie Stone. My favorites on this cd are My Man with Floetry(Very funky track), I wanna thank ya(version w/o rap), U-haul, That kind of Love,Karma. In fact I love almost every song on this album and you know that is very rare these days, most cds out there have only one good song. My advice to any real music lover out there, if you don't have Angie's previous two cd's go pick them up and you won't be dissappointed. Whenever she's in your town check her out because she's phenomenal on stage..."
1,oh my god,"I bought these because I thought I'd save some money and buy 18 of these things instead of just the six that come in the quantum canker patch boxes. Bad idea. These discs are just tiny flimsy little things and they don't stick very well. The quantum canker patches last for hours and hours while these little things will come off within less than one hour. It doesn't feel like it's doing anything except sticking to my mouth. There's no healing or anything going on. I've been using these for days, but nothing's been happening. Yes, I get temporary relief while I have it on, but then it falls off and it hurts again. The quantum canker patches are the only product I've used that really do the job for me. The only thing these discs MIGHT be good for are like, when the canker sore hasn't popped yet. Never buying these again. Complete waste of money."
2,mediocre compared to canker cover,"These are much harder to place and last a much shorter time than Canker Covers. I'd say they last at best 45 minutes, whereas Canker Covers last an entire night's sleep. And while Canker Cover adheres almost instantly, Canker Melts must be held on--and kept dry--for about a minute to adhere, and even then they tend to fall off. The only advantage these have is that they can go somewhere visible, like your inner lip. Canker cover is too big and gloopy for that. Other than that, these are so-so short term relief at best and I see no reason to buy them over Canker Covers."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"I put the disc in my mouth right after I bite the inside of my lip. The Cankermelt irritated the area and it developed into a huge painful canker sore!!! So, no I would not recommend this product."
4,Pretty good product,I have had a few chancre sores over the last few months and this product did a fairly good job at helping reduce some of the pain I had with the sores. I started using Vitamin B-12 to help and I think the combination of the two can do a lot of help.
2,Not as effective.,I have chronic canker sores and thought I was getting a great deal for the price. While these are all natural they aren't as effective as Qauntum's Canker Covers
2,Not an alternative to Canker Cover,I bought canker melts because it was on sale and half the cost of canker covers. This stuff provides relief but only for about 1 hour and then it just slugs right off. I tried putting one of these when I went to bed and I woke up with it in a different place. You can forget trying to eat/drink with this on because it will just come right off. I followed the instructions carefully and still have no idea why I can't get it to work. I tried 3x to get this thing on and it actually aggravated and made my canker sore deeper and more painful. Save your money and stick with Canker Covers.
4,The great mystery that is plumbing,"A charming story, and great illustrations. (I especially liked the plumbing cross-section near the end, it appeals to the engineer in me :)) I remember wondering the same thing many years ago as I stood on tiptoes and stared up at the faucet opening: just where does this thing lead? Wonderful, for ALL us kids"
1,Poor Chrome Quailty,"I suppose I could have just received one that missed QC check, however, as most chromed items of this particular brand the chrome started bubbling and chipping within a couple months."
2,Disappointed,"My son is a blankie kid and loves books, so I thought this would be perfect. As artists, we loved the illustration style, but there are ideas in the book that we don't want to promote - being afraid of the dark, having to go home when we forget blankie, etc. We're putting it in the donation pile."
5,Toddler's Favorite Book,My 2 year old is really into all of Leslie Patricelli's books right now. The little baby/toddler character is right on with my son's actions & thinking. The books are really cute. This one is his favorite right now. We read it about five times a day.
5,Never too young!,My little one is just 9 weeks old and we recently found out how much she loves to be read to. This seems to be one of her favorites as she intently looks at all the bright colors/pictures of each page. Hopefully with fun books like this we can foster a love of reading for the years to come.
5,Highly recommended for toddlers!,"My daughter loves this book, well the entire series in fact, check out the rest by this author. Toddlers love the bright colors, simple,non-intimidating illustrations. The subject matter is adorable!"
4,Cute Little Ring!,"Very cute little toe ring. Easy to adjust and comfortable fit. I had a problem simply because once I put it on, I leave it on and unfortunately I was pretty hard on it.But if you are one that is more careful with your jewelry, it should last you a long time and I would recommend it. After all, the price is right!xoxMEF"
4,Nice collection of artists. Great sound quality.,"Very nice collection of artists. A little bit of everything for nearly everyone's taste in music. It's too bad Dave Mathews had to get political. All the other artists talk about music in their interviews. This dvd is about music, not politics.It would be nice to have an option to play just the songs without the interviews. Once you've seen the interiews, there's no need to watch them again before every performance."
4,Sterling studio takes,"The first set is a good mix of pop/rock/jazz whilst the second set is more heavy metal in nature, and will suit most genres. Colin Bailey Ray never sounded so good before and the raw energy of Gypsy Kings came through prestinely. David Gilmore sounded really good here. The recording is first class all the way and would be an excellent audiophile showpiece. The vocals and musical instruments are very well recorded. The video recording is good and colour rendition is excellent in it's 1080i presentation. A must have for all the audiophiles."
1,cheap skates,This is one of my favorite shows. It's amazing to see and hear such an eclectic variety of artists perform in the Abbey Road studios. But why can't they give us the whole season? This disc sucks because it's not complete.
3,Live from Abbey Road - Blu-ray Info,"Version: U.S.A / Region A, B(?), C(?)Aspect ratio: 1.78:1MPEG-4 AVC BD-50 / High Profile 4.1 / 1080i / 29.970 fpsRunning time: 2:26:44Feature size: 32,88 GBDisc size: 36,32 GBAverage video bit rate: 22.00 MbpsNumber of chapters: 25Subtitles: NoneDTS-HD Master Audio English 2540 kbps 5.1 / 48 kHz / 2540 kbps / 16-bit (DTS Core: 5.1 / 48 kHz / 1509 kbps / 16-bit)Dolby TrueHD Audio English 1963 kbps 5.1 / 48 kHz / 1963 kbps / 16-bit (AC3 Core: 5.1 / 48 kHz / 448 kbps)#Behind the Scenes Look (5 minutes)#Interviews--Dave Matthew--Kasabian--Dave Gilmoreb--Corrine Bailey Rae--Dr. John--John Mayer--Ray LaMontagne"
2,Waste of money,"There is no quick release and like all neck straps--once it is on the camera--is hard to take off. So, you're stuck with this heavy chain-like strap hanging from the camera. If it had a release, it would be great but this way it is a wasted $14."
2,Your kid may find it boring,"I ordered this because I grew up with it; ""El Show de Topo Gigio"" was very popular in Hispanic markets and as a kid I enjoyed it quite a bit. Adults liked it too, I believe that for a while it was shown as part of the evening fare. So I thought it would be a good idea to buy Volumes 1-4 for my daughter, who's two-and-a-half years old.She hated it.The show begins with Topo Gigio conversing with an older gentleman, sort of the interchange Johnny Carson had with Ed McMann...that goes on for several minutes and gets monotonous quick. Then it switches to Topo Gigio doing some cutesy skits.I've seen my daughter disinterested in some children's videos, this is the first one that actually made her cry. I think it's just too outdated compared to modern fare.If you're a diehard Topo Gigio fan and want this as a collectible or to reminisce, it's fine. But as children's fare, I cannot recommend it."
5,Great product,"This product is more effective than NO Xplode. I thought it worked great. I have not had this grape flavor, but check out the reviews under the fruit punch flavor. Huge pump, volumized muscles."
1,Sleep therapy,This mad me real upset with universal product. My stomach was bubbling the whole time i worked out it was bad. Didnt give me no energy what so ever. I was yawning the whole time.
2,A bit disapointed,"Universal Nutrition is a brand I have used many time with great results. This however is a time when I had no results. Great company, but Shock Therepy let me down."
4,Bang for the buck,Good energy and great pumps for the price. Not as good as NO shotgun or Black powder but its so much cheaper and still gets you there. Taste is okay but all of this stuff tastes bad so thats okay. Could be a bit stronger on the vasodialators. I would also like to see more companies add D-aspartic acid to the mix in preworkout drinks for that slight test boost. This stuff is the best bang for the buck on amazon. Quality as always with Universal products.
1,let down,I really had high expectations with this since it was from Universal I've always had good results from there products but I got nothing from this not even a lil pump or even a flush feeling......sorry Universal but guess I'll stay with Hemo Rage
3,To much air in the bottle,"This bottle was only half full when I opened it, I dont know if it is supossed to be that way, but comparing to one that I bought on a store it seems that way."
5,one more time...,"This doll is so beautiful I really could not chose if I wanted the redhead with the peridot dress or the tawny colored hair with the red dress or the pale blonde in the purple dress. At this price? I bought them all! They are so utterly beautiful. The stunning, long hair is pale blonde, instead of the red or tawny hair, and the grown is purple this time (know my cousin Mary is going to love that!), but again so sophisticated. The makeup is perfect, not too little, not too much. Everything about these dolls is perfect. Sheer understated perfection.One of the most beautiful Barbie is last couple of years."
5,Still my favorite perfume,Took me back twenty years. I use to wear this in collage. I cried when I heard it was discontinued. I could not find this anywhere. I am in love all over again! Shipping was fast. Product was in tact! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT. And I will be getting a bigger bottle next time. This is going to put my summer time scent-Perry Ellis 360 degrees to bed!!!!
2,Good for a few years.,"This switch was great for a few years. The fan controls work niecely, but the light switch begins to fail after a couple of years. I have used it with CFL's. Basically the through switch is too slow because it is so small so it sparks and over time builds up residue. I have stripped the switch down and cleaned it completely, but then only got about a half year more out of it. The light switch is just too small to operate with CFL's."
1,bad experience,"The watch is very nice, but my experience is that when I get worked less than a month and then bring it to a jeweler to see if it was the battery and told me it was problems with the machines, send e-mail to purchase and I said I had to call seiko warranty, and in central S SERVICE told me that the model was guaranteed I Disorder & warranty ... very bad experience!"
4,Works!,"My nails and hair are doing much better. Unfortunately, it stinks! Truly smells awful but as long as it does what is proclaims, who cares. I have been buying Swanson brand for many years and have always been pleased with their products."
4,Ottoman surprise,"The ottoman is a little different thanthe picture, and it would have been niceif all four legs were the same length,but for the price, I shouldn't have beensurprised"
1,Empty Box,"I bought this for my kid for his birthday because he loves old cartoons, and there was no dvd when I open ed the box for him. Not happy at all about this"
5,The Best Down South,"If you want a CD as crunk as it gets this one is for you. Bone Crusher is not only a good rapper he can also sing in an unforgettible strong, deep and dirty voice like no other. Hard, crunk, heavy!!!Beware of his other albums ""release the beast"" and ""free"". Both are garbage!"
4,Crunk Worthy,"Heh, when I first picked up the Cd, i jus scanned through the tracks, i was kinda disappointed.... but then when I actually listened to the cd.. it made sense, new beats and a different style.. This cd is definetly worth your few bucks and will cause some ruckus"
2,I am scared of his wack lyrics,Bone Crusher is a huge rap artist and I mean huge as in very fat.He had a song last year called Neva Scared then he appearedon some other peoples stuff but he really does not have that much talent.He really cannot rap and he uses the same words repeaditely.I would not buy this if I were youLyrics 3/10 Production 7/10 X Factor 4/10 Classic 4/10 Me 6/10Overall-24/50 This is worth about 2 Mics
1,"It's too bad Bonecrusher is getting sued for ""Never Scared""","It's sad that such fake artists as Bonecrusher are put in the limelight of todays hip-hop scene, when they dont even use material that is their own. Bonecrusher is being sued by the REAL ARTISTS behind ""Never Scared"", his one and only hit might I add. As a southern rap producer and artist myself, Bonecrusher is looked upon as the lowest of the low amongst us real G's in the industry. Do your online research to read more on the lawsuit..."
5,Sooooooooooooooo Cute!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,When I saw this toy in the photo album Midge comes with I told my Mom and Dad I had to have it!!!! I love it so much!!! It is a great house with lots of realistic things!! If your daughter wants this please buy it before it goes out of stock!! All the things I want for Christmas are out of stock so hurry up moms and dads out there and get shopping!!!!!!!!!!!!!!P.S. My three-year-old neice loves this and I (12) love it too!!!!!!!!!!! 0: )
4,AWESOME BARBIE HOUSE,"Bought this for my 3 year old.Her first Barbie house.Awsemone,love all the gagets,running water sounds in the bathroom.And so much more than the old houses.Thank you for a great product"
4,for girls 4 1/2 to 8 1/2,MY DAUGHTER LOVES THIS DOLLHOUSE. SHE WROTE AN REPORT FOR SCHOOL AND TOLD HOW THE DOLLHOUSE GAVE HER AN INSIGHT TO FAMILY LIFE. EVEN THOUGH THE HOUSE MAY FALL WHEN ITS NOT SET UP RIGHT. SHE AND HER BROTHER WHOS FIVE LIKES TO PLAY WITH HER AS THE OLDER BROTHER AND KIDS WHEN THEY PLAY TOGETHER. THIS TOY DOES MORE FOR LEARNING THAN VIDEO GAMES.EVEN THEIR COUSINS 12 AND 13 PLAY WITH THE DOLLS AND THE HOUSE. THIS IS TRULY AND HANDS ON GAME TO THE WORLD OF PRETEND.
3,"Nice dollhouse, but the Townhouse is better","This is a nice dollhouse, but I like the townhouse better. although the townhouse is missing a few things that the happy family dollhouse has. The townhouse to me is still nicer, it's more colorful than the happy family dollhouse. it should have more bright colors like the Barbie talking townhouse. If I had a choice between the two I would no doubt choose the Talking townhouse. Please bring back the Barbie Talking Townhouse so I can get it for my niece."
3,poo's review,"I was very displeased with the statment, over 100+ phrases and everytime my daughter played with the house it repeated the same phrases over and over again! Also, I think it is really wrong to not include the sticker book full of stickers along with the doll house. I paid enough money for it! These are my major gripes with this product. If someone would E-mail me with info. or a phone number to order the sticker book, that would be really heplful along with sharing how to get the house to say more phrases.Thank you,Mrs. Watkins, CCH, Il."
1,Quite Disappointed,"I purchased this dollhouse for my 3-year-old daughter. I was very disappointed with the quality of not only the house, but the furniture as well. For the quality, it is very overpriced. The dining room table and chairs are so flimsy and cannot stand normal play as they keep collapsing and the actual house itself will tumble over if your child so much as bumps it. The shower curtain rod keeps falling off of the side and the bassinet's parts keep coming off. Even with all the sounds, I still don't think it is worth the money and I am taking this back and purchasing the upright barbie dollhouse as the house and furniture are made of wood; I'm hoping it will be a lot more sturdy."
4,Great bag but misadvertizes,"I purchased this bag through Amazon from a music store. The description was for the deluxe double bag, not the one I received. I thought I was getting a great deal. The music distributor never answered my email about the discrepancy. I like the bag I received, but it was not any less than what I would pay locally"
5,GREAT HUDSON VALLEY ARTIST!,"I have every single book by Mr. Locker and wait anxiously for each new one! Mr. Locker is one of the greatest Hudson Valley artists of all time. If you have not seen his work in person, then the books are the next best thing. His work is outstanding! Congrats, Mr. Locker, and keep the books coming!"
5,Works for me,"I'm pretty well versed in the basics of computer hardware, especially as it relates to games. I've done several motherboard and memory upgrades and a lot of video-card and hard-drive/CD-ROM drive swaps. But the really serious mods -- the windows and lights and bells and whistles -- always seemed a little beyond me.I always thought it would be cool to have a slick-looking, modded-up PC, but I wasn't sure I could handle the work, and I didn't really want to buy a ready-made one from the handful of companies that make them (and know it was really just like a thousand others out there). I was also afraid it'd end up being too expensive to justify.But this book convinced me I could do it, and without breaking the bank. I even used the book to convince a couple of friends to go in with me on the tools and materials, so we can share the costs. We figure if a ""Dummy"" can do it, then we can.Great stuff. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone looking to do their own custom mods."
2,Generally horrific...,"Although there are some good CGI clips, TeleVoid is probably a good title for this DVD. Not much here to get excited about. Some bad animation work will cause diehard fans of the genre to writhe in pain. The rock soundtrack by Paul Speer (? ) and Scott Rockenfield of Queensryche failed to ignite.Best part of this DVD are at the ""bonus clips"" with some surprisingly good surreal work from France and Japan."
5,Total Awesome,"Everyone should buy a copy of this DVD and review it, if only for self information. My classes have throughly enjoyed it, as have I. Great DVD!"
1,Sorry to say,"Given the prestige of the authors involved, I think this book is very disappointing. Mostly a rambling collection of professorial articles that do not give the reader any concrete advice or business tools to work with.We all love Peter D. but this is not up to par with his standard level of brilliance."
5,This is a required supplemental text book I teach for Webster University,Outstanding collection of articles from the best-known business leaders. The graduate business class I teach is titled: Critical Analysis and Decision Models. The 8 articles in this book match perfectly with the course and we cover one article each week. This is in addition to the primary text book for the course. Dr. Don Brady
3,I didn't like much this Wrestlemania,The matches were not good at all....it could be better but wwe din't effort themself to the top...i expect that next mania would be better
3,This event is getting boring every year.,"I am a huge fan of the wwe/f have been for over 10 yrs. The last Wrestlemania I actually enjoyed was 20. There are eight matches already announced for Mania 24, three of which I could care less who wins, I thought the card could of been alot better, I guess I was wrong, come on WWE get it together."
3,First WrestleMania DVD that is not worth the $$$,"This is the first WrestleMania DVD that I have bought that I am very upset with. Usually the three disc set is Disc 1 & 2 being the event, and alot of extras on disc 2. Then disc 3 is usually the entire Hall of Fame, this year Disc 1 & 2 features the event, and Disc 2 & 3 is the Hall of Fame. The only ""extra"" is the Battle Royal before the event, and I don't even consider that an extra since it was shown on [...] before WrestleMania began. I was going to purchase this DVD no matter what because of the Hall of Fame, as I do every year. Yet the extras always make the dvd a collectable, but this year the WWE did not put alot of effort into this release. I was hoping for extras like Mr. McMahon on the walk of fame, press conference highlights, or even Ric Flair highlights. I hope the lack of extras of Ric Flair shows up on his next DVD release in july."
2,Damaged,Box was in bad conditions. plastic case was damaged and scraches all over the box. Just overall bad codition product.
4,good movie..,the movie took a little longer than i expected to arrive but other than that it was a good copy at a decent price...
4,Handy Reference Guide,"Great little booklet at 64 pages, with information on compacts ranging from 1920's through to 1990's. I found this really useful as there is plenty of information on different types and styles plus a section on caring for compacts.Good for the compact collector who is establishing a collection."
5,Extraordinarily helpful,"This book is a tremendous resource for those who are not familiar with Kosher food preparation. I was in charge of a Seder Dinner at a Catholic Church and although I had a Jewish mentor, was so glad to also have this book, since it guided us through even the proper table settings for this beautiful meal. VERY GOOD!"
4,Good Product!,"I'm 42 years and very active. I started using DHEA a little over a month ago, taking 1 100mg captule every morning. So far I've personally went from 10% body fat to 9% body fat. My skin feels like it did 15 years ago (softer/younger). My only complaint would be that I'm getting the occational blimish. I don't mind using Oxy a couple times a month for the added benefits."
3,Good but over priced,Shipped promptly and product arrived packaged as promised.An important ingredient in maintaining optimum health. Please do not take any hormones without a HRT Certified Doctor monitoring your levels. Too much of any hormone is dangerous.My last reorder was Swanson brand.
3,DHEA,"DHEA has been known to cause many heated debates between fitness experts. Originally recommended to me by a friend, I decided to ""google"" around a bit. I read numerous articles praising it and just as many de-bunking it.When it all came down to it I finally decided to try it based on an article that I had read that mentioned some really interesting results. Basically, the users weight remained the same only there was more muscle and less fat as a result of taking DHEA (1500mg/day study). I was dissappointed though when I got the bottle and it said to not exceed more than one capsule a day, in this case a 100mg dose.While I can't state that I have experienced results the like of what I had read about I can say that I'm firmer and I seem to get better results out of my weight training sessions. Unlike some of the other DHEA products this one also contains 100mg doses rather than the 50mg that allot of the others offered with the same 1 pill a day direction."
2,Got pimple w/ this,"Perhaps this will work for other people; it just gave me acne-lots of it. I did sleep somewhat better, but that was about all."
2,this stuff kills my complection,i got the worst zits right on my temples every time i took this stuff. very painful and very unattractive
4,"Thought it said ""Bondage of the Wii""",My daughter - in college - thinks this book is quite useful. Glad she does - as the professor gave her little choice about it as her textbook.
5,A gift for my husband.,"The Packer Intro alone is worth having this edition of this classic!We knew that before we ordered this copy, because it is a replacement for the copy my husband lent out one too many times - and finally lost track of it!"
4,The Ongoing Debate,"I purchased Luther's book for my ""Formation of Modern Christianity"" class and am in the process of using it to write my term paper on the debate between Erasmus and Luther on the issue of free will. Luther does an excellent job in this book when presenting his case for the bondage of free will by demonstrating that humans are completely depraved and cannot choose salvation, therefore we do not have the free will to do both good and evil, but only evil. Buy this book if you want a clear picture on this ongoing debate, but make sure to also purchase ""Discourse on Free Will"" to gain a picture of Erasmus' point of view, as well."
3,too spiteful,"This book contained some good arguments for the bondage of the will, but Luther clothed these arguments in such poisonous, sarcastic invective for Erasmus that it turned me off to Luther's way of thinking. This wouldn't have disturbed me so much had I thought Luther was right, but in my view he's a little off the mark. His treatment of the gospel inferences that point to some kind of *personal* responsibility or liability in faith wasn't very strenuous. This is a good book, worth the read for perspective and insight, but at the same time I would not, unlike some orthodox Lutherans, put this book on a similar par with the Bible."
3,The Classic Text Refuting the False Notion of Free Will,"This is the classic text refuting the false notion that human beings have free will. I won't go into the argument in this review, because I do believe humans have free choice, which is different than free will. Our choices are bounded by our humanity and environment.This book takes some work to get through before you get to his argument about the will being in bondage. Much of this is a refutation of the work of Erasmus, who argued along with Pelagius that humans do have free will. No one could dispute like Luther! Some of his words sound rather uncivil to us, but are definitely the man and his times.If you are looking for a more accessible book on this topic for modern north American readers, check out ""Willing to Believe"" by R. C. Sproul. For a more thoughtful reading on the topic than Luther, John Calvin in his ""Institutes of the Christian Religion"" writes about this topic.This review is of the kindle version."
3,There was a rejoinder!,"Many reviewers here have given this book rave reviews, believing Luther annihilated Erasmus in this controversy. What is not widely known is that Erasmus wrotea massive two-volume rejoinder titled ""Hyperaspistes"" (in Erasmus' Works, volumes 76 and 77)Both volumes are available on Amazon."
4,Luther for the Modern Reader,The authors have done a commendable job of bringing the debate between two of the Reformation's prime leaders into the modern forum. I appreciate the easily-read type-setting and general formatting of this book.
4,"Wonderful book, but not easy reading","This book is a ""must-read"" for the growing Christian. It lays out the basis of our salvation and our faith in Christ.However, it is probably not a book to read while lying by the pool. You must spend extra time reading it in ordert to comprehend the author's (and translator's) meaning. It's the type of book that's easy to get frustrated with and simply put down."
4,Frieza's Transformation,"Frieza's first transformation is hard. Anyways, while Goku is recovering, it seems that everyone is on Frieza's hit list. First on the list is Krillin, then Gohan takes a shot at him and holds his own for a while, until Frieza crushes him that is. But then, Krillin makes a comeback thanks to the healing power of Dende, he buys Him the time he needs to heal Gohan. But what's this. Piccolo The Super Namek appears to fight Frieza. It seems like a death wish has been granted for Piccolo, but with his strength increased, Piccolo takes it to Frieza. Can Piccolo buy Goku the time he needs to recover in time? Watch more of the Frieza saga and find out!!!!"
2,Uneven,"Tropic of Cancer, the book is filled with titillating imagines, it flows uneven at times but somehow remains focus. Our little movie here is like a dream of the book. Clouded and fuzzy, but still titillates. Henry Miller was alive with the soul of an angel, disguised in the body and mind of a scoundrel. I believe if you love his work, you'll appreciate this movie. It's uneven, to be sure, the dialog drifts apart at times. However, you will enjoy the moments of recognition and taste the infatuation with life, even when faced with despair. Of course Henry and June, the Kaufman Movie is superior, however, it's the uneven parts of ToC that remind one of HM's Books. Life is uneven!"
4,Its Great! Love it.,"APPARENTLY, the other reviewers do not know how to use this stroller PROPERLY. You have to lock one set of wheels when you're using it, otherwise they all move in different directions. You are supposed to lock the ones closest to you, in the back, whichever way the stroller is facing. If everyone did this then nobody would complain about the steering.I also should mention, who buys a stroller without testing it out in person first? This is a very important thing to moms, and I would never buy one without testing it at a store.I tested one and I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it. When used properly, its a great stroller."
1,This stroller stinks...,"I am very unhappy with this stoller. The front wheels have fallen off more than once when popping it up from the collapsed position. When the handle is reversed, it is really hard to walk without kicking the wheels, and it is extremely hard to steer.Even with the handle in the correct position, I often feel like I am pushing a shopping cart with messed up front wheels. I have only been using this stroller for about 2 months. I don't think that it will last for the years it is meant to."
1,Awful,These rods are inexpensive for a reason. They are made cheaply. They bend and break with the first amount of stress they receive.
4,unforsaken,"From the first page, I could not put the book down. I had to see what Olivia was going to do next. I felt drawn to the time period and characters. I loved the way the author used dry wit and humor, I could not read fast enough to finish each chapter. What can I say, I loved the book ..."
2,It wasn't as big as I need it and it didn't bend without breaking a little like I needed it too,"I needed a bigger, flatter, and more flexible for what I needed it for. I was trying to use it for a turtle deck"
5,LINK--THE MASTER OF FIRE!!,LINK---is totally awsome. In some segments you will laugh or even be frightened to death. He is one mean monkey!!If you love science or even horror you would love this film. You will think twice raising a monkey to be a servant to you!! Just to remember to forgive and love one another.
4,Funny and well done suspense and thrill...,"This movie is not very famous but is a very well manufactured thriller. Miss Shue is very sexy and desirable, Terence Stamp is not the worst actor I have seen on screen. If you like Hitch's ""Birds"" you will like this pleasant movie.Final action scene could be more efficient with a better editing.By the way the music is composed by Jerry Goldsmith."
4,UNSETTLING UK HORROR,"Not widely known, this nifty 1986 British horror film stars a young Elisabeth Shue (was this her first film?) and mature Terence Stamp. ""Link"" is brilliant orangutan who attacks his masters when they try to put him down. Although the title creature is clearly an orangutan, he is referred to as a chimp. It looks like his naturally reddish fur has been dyed dark brown or black.The one scene I recall most vividly is when Shue's character is undressed and about to take a bath, Link opens the bathroom door, enters, and looks at her naked body longingly as she freezes, about to step into the tub.Shot on location in Scotland, the emotive score is by Jerry Goldsmith. The taught direction is by the late Richard Franklin."
3,Poor import function,"The .avi file created with Studio PCTV can not be imported. It always give a error message ""end of file reached"", although the same file was played perfectly well in other media player (e.g. Microsoft Media Player)."
1,Nothing to WOO about!,"This Wendy Woo album is boring to listen to. She has a very limited range and most of the songs on here sound the same. The tempos on here are slow and jarry. Not what I had in mind. If you want a really good Wendy Woo album, get ""Gonna Wear Red"". That's my favorite."
2,"Pretty Animation, Dull Story","At first look Gasaraki looks very good in terms of mecha design and animation. Gasaraki is undoubtedly one of the best looking animes I have ever seen but the story is very uneventful. They try to mix up mythology with mecha (kind of like in Neon Genesis Evangelion), but the story is lacking. In the first couple of episodes in the series there are actually some decent action scenes, however as the story progresses all they do is just talk. It basically becomes some kind of political drama mixed with some not so original religious type story. It is just very slow and in my opinion VERY VERY boring. It just drags on and on about politics and that stupid kai thing. For people who are looking for action and good story this will not be for you as this mediocre anime is seriously lacking in both."
5,Simply last year's best movie!!!,This DVD is definitively the best I have ever bought. This movie is a whole experience. I have watched it over and over and every time I enjoy it even more.
3,Nothing special...,When Corey Taylor took a vacation from Slipknot many fans were upset. Two years later Stone Sour is enjoying success after their debut album while Slipknot is just getting back together to hit the studio. Bother was the first single off of the album and to be quite honest I was not impressed. Taylor's voice is much improved on Bother but nothing special when compared to other vocalists in his genre. Musically it's not very bland and what you'd expect from the members. Lyrically it's much improved from Slipknot but still leaves a sour (pardon the pun) taste in my mouth. If you're looking to try Stone Sour out this is the best start possible as the album follows in the singles footsteps.
5,Crucial introduction to cultural evolutionary theory,"This book was my premier introduction to cultural evolutionary theory. Leslie White, in his detailed discussions about energy capture and evolution, captured my imagination and helped me to decide to enter the field of archaeology. In many ways he was ahead of his time, and he should still be required reading for undergraduate anthropology and archaeology majors."
5,An excellent corrective to ethnocentrism.,It is unfortunate that this book is out of print. It is an excellent introduction to the theory of culture and to the challenging concept of cultural determinism. It was one of the most fascinating texts of my undergraduate experience and a valuable corrective to ethnocentric smugness.
1,Religion :(,"When i purchased this book I was looking for something that would help me write a comepletly secular ceremony for my wedding. This book is not secular by any means!!! It outlines certain ways to have a ceremony based on a series of different relgions. I have certain words that will be omitted from my ceremony (god, christ, worship, covenent, etc) and this book didnt help. every passage the offer has one of these words in it. It does have about a page on civil services, so i guess its not all bad. But if you are like me dont bother buying this book, its not helpful."
2,Traditional Christian Book,"This book is perfect for couples planning the ""Cookie Cutter Same As Traditional Wedding."" It is a Christian Wedding book, there are no good alternative vows, readings, blessing, or optional elements. It is a dry and boring read. It would be easier to go online and pull up ""The Book Of Common Prayer Wedding and print it. The intent of the book is misleading with the title. The Title of The Book Should Read: Your Standard Basic No Frills Christian Wedding. That way readers know what they are purchasing and will be satisfied instead of disappointed."
1,not all that great,too much junkdidnt like the book it was more religious and not common person stuff didnt like it.
2,Last Song,"Hey Paul, I believe the last song you're referring to is ""Clocks"" by Coldplay"" off their album A Rush of Blood to the Head. Great song!"
4,Good soundtrack for good movie,"I remember first watching this movie and thought it was really told well. What made it a little extra special was the mood of the music. It wasn't overbearing or underwhelming. A couple scenes stand out as to why I wanted the soundtrack. they being 1) the scene in which the money was being picked up and and moved from one place to another across the street (all about the money) 2) the romantic scene (intuition) both of which the snippets of music went together beautifully. The rest of the soundtrack is just that pieces of time in the movie. Nothing really eventful. There's only like 3 or 4 full songs that aren't memorable but, for me those two scenes were enough for me to warrant a purchase."
3,Already had this product and didn't realize it.,"Item was as described. Can't see why they want so many words in the this description, as I said, it's a program."
3,Mediocre quality hardware cloth,"I don't know where the spooling of this wire went wrong but the first of the two rolls I purchased is terrible. Instead of a nice straight edge the wire has a wave across the width. If I needed a piece of wire more than 4"" long x 4"" wide it wouldn't be square. I cut a piece 11-1/2"" long x 5"" wide to go over a vent and it looked like those sponges that are curved on their sides to better fit your hand, nowhere near a rectangular shape.If what you're using it for doesn't require a neat appearance it at least has a fair quality of weld. I use the wire for aluminum rabbit feeders I build to allow feed dust to pass thru, so I can hide most of the imperfection."
4,Decent,"Overall, good quality cloth (welded properly with good galvanization), but, as with some other reviews, is somewhat wavy across the width, which is the reason for the slight downgrade. This mesh size (1/8"") is impossible to find locally, except in very large lengths. The 10' length was perfect for my application. I used the cloth for replacement (inside the attic and thus unseen) screens for attic gable vents, so the wave in the cloth was not an issue in my case. Disappointing, but not unexpected, to see that the product was made in China, which may explain the flaw."
3,I get seasick looking at it,"One reviewer mentioned how wavy this stuff is, but I thought it may just have been a fluke and he just got a roll from a bad run. I got the same wavy stuff. The mesh is wavy across its width. It's straight down its length. I'm using this where it won't be seen so its not a huge problem, but if it was visable, I would insist on a refund! He also didn't mention that it's made in China."
2,"I did not get a packing slip with this item, so now what do I do?",I didn't get a invoice with this and one or more of the pens were damaged. Can I still return this Item with invoice or packing slip.
5,...Communism was a hoax perpetrated by financiers 'to control the common man' and to advance world tyranny,"""In her book, 'School of Darkness' (1954) she gives evidence to support the claim that Communism was a hoax perpetrated by financiers 'to control the common man' and to advance world tyranny.""[...]'nuff said."
2,Not What I Expected,"I ordered this book for a gift. It was small. It was a paperback. A coffee table book was what I'd expected. Something a car collector would drool over. It would be a great reference for a kid who is just beginning to love cars, but not for a car collector. Since it was Dec. 24 when it came, I had to give it anyway. Disappointing."
1,stupid aliens,wow i know this is not a high budget film but god this thing is pathetic the aliens are stupid the people are retarded and the end is a pile of garbage...to be continued in alien species 2.... but oh wait this thing was a pile of crap so they didn't make one..if your going to buy this be prepared to laugh at how pathetic it is.
1,Wrong product shipped,"I ordered this product, but when it came it was not the same one I ordered. It was different than the one pictured and described on the page. How can they mess that up?"
3,The 6 month kettle,"I have owned this kettle for about 6 months, I loved it. It whistles loud, heats up fast too! We just discovered that the top part of the handle has come un-welded right from the kettle itself. I keep forgetting to get a new one so now everytime I pour it I pray the handle isn't going to fall off, spill and the water burn my feet."
4,Good Tips...Useful for Max OS X Leopard,"""Mac OS X Tiger: Top 100 Simplified Tips & Tricks"" offers a useful, and easily understood, set of tips and tricks for the Mac OS X (Tiger) operating system.As a user moving back to using a Mac after a long period of exclusive use of various versions of the Microsoft Windows operating system, this book was quite useful for me to get up to speed quickly on Mac OS X (Leopard).While there are many sources of information on how to use the Mac OS X operating system, this book provided concise, ""bite-sized"" techniques that had me up and running efficiently on my Mac in a short period of time.I recommend this book as a good return on time invested."
4,mac os x tiger,"The book is very helpful. While it is limited to the ""Top 100"", it covers a lot of things useful to Mac users."
2,detailed but shallow,"The 300+ page book--Preacher--a bio about Billy Sunday by Robert Bruns has great detail and side stories not included in shorter bio,s.He had detailed references,other available followup bio,s about this man and a complete index in the back of this book.Included are pictures of his baseball days as well as his later years.He gives the lives of his brothers (some of whom outlived Billy)and their riotious lives which greatly grieved Billy.Now the reason for the 2 stars--it is simply written (in my opinion) from a secular viewpoint,not written as from another believer in Christ.Don,t get me wrong this book is very complete,but it lacks any depth of spirituality about this great man Billy Sunday,and as such will hold back valuable spiritual lessons and guidance which was the reason for buying this book in the 1st place."
2,Not what I was hoping for...,"Maybe I just didn't judge the size right, but when something says plus size, it should fit a plus-size woman. These didn't fit at all. The stockings themselves were tight while the garter was too large.All I can say is measurements count, and if you're going to order something like this, make sure you know what you're getting."
1,INACCURATE SIZING!,I ORDERED THIS IN PLUS SIZE AND IT DID NOT FIT. THE TOP OF THE STOCKING WERE TOO TIGHT TO GO UP THE LEG. I NORMALLY WEAR A SIZE 18 SO I WOULD THINK THAT WHEN SOMETHING SAYS PLUS SIZE IT SHOULD FIT.
1,Very disappointing,"I had baught a similar item in England and it was great. This one is too long and dowsn't in general fit right (and I am 5'10, so imagine for someone shorter!!!). One of them had a whole in it. I do not recommend this at all."
3,Decent debut,"This was decent debut from Sentence. The beats are dark and ominous. His rhymes are okay. He sounds alot like Aesop Rock, but a little bit deeper voiced and not nearly as talented. I gave this three stars because it is enjoyable and I listen to it alot, but it is not something I will listen to all the time."
4,Galco Royal Guard,I've used the Galco Royal Guard Inside the Pant Holster for about three years now alternating with a Miami Classic II depending on the ambient temperature and the clothing I happen to be wearing. It works well with jeans and a wide belt and is fairly comfortable even in the hottest weather. The FBI cant makes this a very easy and quick holster to draw from. I like being able re-holster one handed also. The rough side out leather helps keeps the holster in position so it's not sliding around with your movements. I would recommend this holster to anyone who wants to carry a large defensive pistol in an inside the pant style holster.
4,Good story,"I enjoyed this story told of a fragile woman caught in an abusive relationship to a narcissistic cold man of a husband. It started out by laying the groundwork of their unhealthy relationship and started to build up to a climax. However, at that point the story did not go the direction I expected it to. Without giving away too much, I'd just say I wasn't exactly disappointed with the ending, however I was anticipating it to go in a more sinister dramatic direction towards the end rather than the way it did. Overall, I did enjoy it and would recommend. It's short and was a quick read."
5,Grease - Sandy,I collect dolls and purchased this item formyself. She is true to the likeness of Sandy(Olivia Newton-John) and is beautifully crafted.Highly recommend this doll!
1,Difficult to use - Poor Customer Service,"I purchased Corel Draw 9.0 to make maps, text, and graphics. I find it hard to use, and incompatible with most of the commercial printers I use.I have not been impressed with their customer service to correct problems inherent in my software. It's been 36 hours since I've tried to resolve why my software won't mirror, and I still don't have an answer."
3,"Unique and awesome sitcom, but this review is on the dvd sets","I give the sitcom itself 4-5 stars. It's great and creative within it's simplicity and I especially enjoy the episodes where the great supporting cast (spence, deacon, lou ferigno, etc) have a lot. Stiller is as always brilliant. My problem is with the dvd collection itself which unfortunately has ALOT of repeat episodes in the volumes. For instance in the 5th season DVD set at least half of the contained footage is from previous seasons. This goes for all the other sets as well so you'll have to pick and choose the episodes from the menus as u go along just to avoid having seen the same episode 3 times or more depending on what season you have. Wish each season only had THAT season's episodes on it. Of coarse if they did it that way there'd probably only be one cd per season and maybe they figured they could charge more if they did it this way. I'd give the dvd's one star for that and give it all three stars to average it out."
4,Good,"Excellent product is pretty good although it is second hand, I would like to know more about the books he sells this store because it shows the quality of these"
3,Beautiful Stories,"This book is totally awesome. A particularly intriguing story is ""Talks With Dean Spanley"". The condition of the book seemed to me a little misleading. It was listed as ""Used, Very Good"", and then particulars on the bill of lading said, ""binding a bit loose, but book intact, book has some wear, inside no writing or highlighting. (G11). True, the binding was loose. They didn't mention that there was paint all over the cover and the back of the book, and stains on the top of all pages. Considering the content of the book, and that I paid very little for it, it was a bargain, but the seller could have been more forthright about the true condition. I would rate the book (5) and the seller (3), and I concede that the condition statement could have been oversight on the part of the seller."
2,Not one of Hammer best,"This 1970 nth sequel from Hammer is a poor relation to their original classic with Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee. Ralph Bates lacks the screen presence and charisma of Peter Cushing, and his portrayal of Victor Frankenstein is actually rather irratating.There is nothing new in this film. In essence its the classic story re-told, but its all strangely flat for a Hammer film. The only reason it got two stars rather than one is because both Kate O'Mara and Veronica Carlson look gorgeous in the film and there are couple of lovely comedic moments which made me laugh out loud. Sadly though I think this is a reflection of the fact that Hammer really had nothing new to say with this film. Dave Prowse (the Green Cross Code Man) only appears in the last 1/3 of the film and is rather wasted, which is a shame because he made quite an imposing monster.My advice buy only if its very cheap!"
2,Disappointing Hammer,"Don't get your hopes up for this 1970 Hammer film as it's several rungs below any of the other Frankensteins made by Hammer. Very noticeably absent is any horror(silly monster) and really can't understand the R rating as there was no nudity and very little gore. Film never seems to go anywhere nor generate excitement and by the end your wondering what was the point? Really would have hoped for more from Mr. Sangster, considering his contributions to Hammer's classics. A black humored misfire."
4,Hairy Dog Joke,"Some people just can't get this film. First, don't even try to compare it to the Cushing films, this one obviously wasn't intended to be anything like them. Second, it isn't some comedy meant to be filled with laughs, it is a subtle parody. The cast is perfect for the way the characters were intended to be portrayed, and the ending is quite clever, a purposefully anti-climactic finish that puts the dot at the end of this clever hairy dog joke of a film. I detract one star because, though I was surprised at the uniqueness of the film, it isn't one I'd watch repeatedly like the Cushing films."
3,"Averge book, For the beginner","This book has some good ideas regarding performance review, but is more general than necessary. Could use better examples. About a third of the book is ""filler"", apparently an attempt to hit 100 pages."
5,EXCELLENT BOOK!!!!,"I usually never read textbooks. Given the choice, I'd much rather have something explained to me in person. THIS BOOK, however, reads casually enough so that it doesn't get too dry. The concepts are very well-organized and the structure of the book presents the material in a manner so logical, its virtually impossible NOT to learn if you give the examples enough thought. Overall, GREAT book. I love it!!!"
5,Wonderful,"This is simply the best math book ever made. You can just sit down and read it and understand it, plus Nonlinear Dynamics is really interesting stuff."
5,Non linear dynamics made easy,"Its gem of a book. Ideal for anyone wishing to start with non-linear dynamics. Strogatz lucidly explains theconcepts and the book includes diverse applications ranging from science to engineering. From what Iexperienced, Strogatz's pedagogical approach is similar to that of Feynman's. He makes things simple and presents a different point of view for previously known concepts."
5,"Just one of a ""Collector Doll Set""","This is a collector doll. It is just one of a 'One of a Kind' Doll set. This will be hard to find in a year or so, let alone the Set!"
5,Bobby knows exactly how to cut to the chase with HUGE laughs,"I've seen this guy in person. He's hysterical!-He knows how to touch on all aspects of everyday life including the ""taboo"" racial stuff--but somehow he knows how to do it without offending--Highly recommended!!!!"
3,Not as sour as they say,"I ordered these from the internet after reading a review on how sour these were. After the first 10-15 sec its gone and its just a regular lemon head, i would rank the sourness about a 7 on a 1 - 10 scale."
3,Good But Expensive,"These candies are very good - super sour for the first 10 to 15 seconds and then a nice lemon flavored hard candy after that. My problem is the price - $7.99 for a 2.6 ounce bag. Too much, in my opinion."
5,Paper Envelopes that hold CD's,"Envelopes, made of paper, that hold CD's and DVD's. Hey, it even has a plastic window so you can see the label! What are you waiting for? Buy some now!"
3,Review of Craigie's Deuteronomy,"Briefly, Craigies' commentary on Deuteronomy is a good synopsis of the content. However, the work lacks much of the sort of detail that expositor's of the text are often looking for in a commentary. Obviously, there is much to cover in such a work, but his strength is not so much in linguistic studies, but in giving one an overall sense of the flow and meaning of the text. This is a good resource for introducing one to the thought of Deuteronomy. Unfortunately, it is lacking in much of what an expositor wants, particularly in an OT commentary."
5,newradioooohhhhh,Funny as hell its a shame the black chick left the show but oh well life goes on and its funny when it does one of the funniest shows to ever grace the small screne
5,Best Show Ever!,"Just my favorite show of all time. Unfortunately overlooked by audiences, but it's comedic genious is in every episode which is just so rare in today's comedy arena. Sometimes you miss jokes because you are still laughing from the last joke, which means the episodes have multiple watches. I hope you enjoy!I just wanted to add to the one's review who did not have information on episode 63.Episode 63. Look Who's Talking. Dave and Lisa are surprised to learn that Bill is looking into adopting a baby."
3,News Radio - 4th season,This was a disappointing season for news radio - the story lines became dull and not nearly as funny. It was still a decent show - but not nearly as good as the first three.
5,Nueva generacion,I came to know Los Iracudos in 2001 at the age of 26 and quickly appreciated their music and now I listen to it whenever I want to relax. Later I learned that my parents used to listen to this group and it was a good feeling that we could enjoy the same music. This group is truly timeless. Hola a todos de Peru y Sud America!
5,Circuit breaker,"The Siemens 30 amp circuit breaker purchased from Amazon fits the Square D Electric service entrance panel perfectly. When I received the breaker it was ""tripped"" and had to be ""reset"" before it would connect."
2,Amazing talent wasted in a boring movie,"Drugs are boring but funny and/or exciting movies can be made about people trying to find, hide, or get rid of drugs. With the amazing talents of Rhys Ifans, David Thewlis, Crispin Glover, and Chloe Sevigny this must be one of those funny and/or exciting movies.It isn't."
4,bluegrass virtuoso shows comedic side,"Orrin Starr's finest work now released on CD! I wore out my old LP ( autographed by OS himself at one of his shows) in the early 90's and was delited to see this re-issue. Orrin hails from the Cambridge Massachussets area and was part of the aspiring guitar collective that created magical acoustic guitar music during the 70's and 80's. Along with Rick Ruskin, one of America's finest flatpickers ( and a nice guy to boot!)"
2,"Fun, but FAR TOO LOUD!","My kids (1 1/2 and 4) love magna doodles, and the oldest one's a huge Little Einsteins fan, so this was a big hit for christmas. The stensils are a bit lame, but the kids don't mind.The one big drawback with this toy, however, is the volume. I have NEVER heard a toy so loud, and it ruins much of the expirience. Desperately needs a volume control - even after I've taped over the speaker. Also, the feature that makes the music pause and continue every time you lift the ""pen"" is extremely annoying - listening to Vivaldi in two-seond-intervals on/off can kill anybody's taste for classical music. A shame, really, 'cause the idea was good..."
5,BIG surprise,"I am an anime DVD collector with over 250 anime DVDs to date. I bought the Sorcerer Hunters DVDs for this series without high expectations. I never heard of the series before, but since I love fantasy, I decided to try it out. The first few episodes were OK. They reminded me of the Slayers series (which I got bored with midway through the series). However, the disconnected comic episodes soon developed a running storyline that was both original and compelling. Characters began to be more developed and my interest grew. I ended watching the last two DVDs in one sitting and was sad when it ended. The last episode, though, was sure a blast, expecially Chocolate's new outfit! Also, great music! Along with Escaflowne and Record of Lodoss War - Chronicles of the Heroic Knight, Sorcerer Hunters is on my list of the best fantasy anime of all time."
4,skinny bed,"This is a great little extra sleeping space, but very narrow. A large adult would NOT find it comfortable. However, I bought it for my grandson, for when he sleeps over, and it is great for that! Plus, folds up to a small chair (wouldn't want to sit in it for too long) that is out of the way."
3,"OK for kids, not so much for adults","I had one of these years ago. They start out very firm, but the foam core quickly loses its shape, so after a few months you get no support. They are very uncomfortable. It is difficult to remove the inner foam to clean the outer fabric. These are inadequate as extra beds for adult guests. They would be good, however, as fun, colorful lounging chairs in a child's room. If you get two or three, the kids can prop them up in an inverted V shape and make tunnels, or throw sheets over them to build tents!"
5,Great for guests and watching television...,"This studio chair sleeper is more comfortable than a sofa bed, reasonably priced, and easy to clean. And even a large adult can use it."
4,More comfy than our couch,This is more comfy than our couch. Very versatile... can move from room to room as needed. Good quality. Worth the money.
3,"Little expensive, but fills the need","A little pricey for what you get, but it filled our need for extra sleeping area. Makes a great chair for the kids, and seems to be holding up. I think we'd buy it again."
4,SERVED IT'S PURPOSE,I PURCHASED THIS FOR AN EXTRA BED FOR COMPANY SLEEP OVERS AND IT WORKED OUT GREAT. IT IS COMFORTABLE AND USES UP LITTLE SPACE. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT FOR SHORT TERM USE.
4,good to have,Perfect for when friends sleep over. My kids drag it between rooms to accommodate their buddies! Pretty sturdy and good quality. Not good for adults because your body will be stiff in the morning! ;)
2,very accurate description for size and color,"If they had said anything about comfort or ""softness"" I would have to challenge them.This is like trying to lay on concrete... maybe they get softer over time. I will never know. I have already given both of them away, after using them one time.There are many others on the market that are actually comfortable.Good luck, maybe if you need a very firm mattress, you will like it."
4,Chair sleeper,We got two sleeper chairs for when the grand kids come to visit. They have been working out very well
4,"nice chair, a bit firm for sleeping",This fold-out chair is nice for the price. It is rather firm if it is going to be used opened for sleeping. It should hold up well due to the firmness and structure. It is heavier than other chairs I owned like it in the past. I found it a little more difficult to quickly change back to chair from open but that is a fair trade-off if it last longer because it is sturdier. I did not rate it 5 stars due to the firmness as a sleeping mat.
3,It's OK for a last minute bed...,"The chair is all right. I slept on it for three weeks. I found a twin fitted sheet that did the job of covering it. I had to turn the chair upside-down on the floor to have the ""bed"" effect with a ""pillow"" (this is the roll that makes up the back when it is folded as a chair). It served its purpose, temporary bed. I also sat on it during the day, using a pillow to close the distance between the chair's back and mine. It is light and easy to move, open and close."
3,Nothing special,It is very basic and not very comfortable. You will not be able to sit in this chair for a long time and watch tv. It looks ok in the corner of the family room. I would not recommend this item.
3,"convenient, not comfortable.","This is a convenient chair that turns into a bed, however it is not comfortable, the foam inside is very hard, there is hardly any plush to it, I'm assuming its because it is expected to wear over time, so they make it extra sturdy, but definitely a quick 1 person bed if needed. and a decent looking chair for a study or kids room."
2,Not worth it,"Bought this for my 10 y.o. son's room. While it's definitely an improvement from sleeping on the floor for sleepovers, I can't recommend it. After several months of usage, the foam cushion loses it's shape. Should have gone with a lower end futon, because I doubt this will hold up much longer. Okay for little kids (under 12) as temporary sleeping arrangement, but not good for much else."
3,"Great chair design and size, very cheap-looking out fabric.","My order arrived today. Wow--the ""Poly-Cotton"" outer fabric is very cheesy and thin. I was so disappointed with this. It looks and and feels more like nylon (or even the dated ""Ban-lon"" synthetic of the 1960s) with a cheap shine to it. I cannot believe that this outer fabric contains any cotton. The shape and size of the chair/bed are great, but what tacky outer fabric! I can't imagine many people wanting to present this as furniture. I'm not returning it, but will put pillows and cloths over it to hide this junky fabric. The outer fabric looks nothing like the photo on Amazon, which resembles a sturdy cotton. I got navy blue, so at least it's dark. I would not order this again based on the unattractive, poor quality cloth chosen to cover this foam piece of furniture."
2,Poverty Row CinemaScope!?,"Revenge of the Zombies is presented in a matted (non-anamorphic) transfer. You ever heard of a widescreen film from 1943? Transfer for this Mantan Moreland gem is pretty bad, too. The Terror actually looks better than my other copy. This one was filmed in 1:85:1 , course you get a pan and scan full screen here. (scratching head) Stick with Criterion if you're considering this disc for Carnival of Souls. Bonus CD is one of those scary sounds Halloween type records, newly recorded and more annoying than scary. There you have it. If you need a copy of The Terror you could do worse, but you're better off with a gray market copy of Revenge and a Criterion Carnival."
5,Track Listing,"1. Legs2. Legs (Instrumental)3. Such a Night4. My Momma And My Poppa (Original Version)5. Packin' UpTrack 1 from the Ubiquity LP ""Let My People Go."" Tracks 2-5 previously unreleased. Released on vinyl only."
2,In The Arms of Strangers,"The loved the documentary, but the VHS has a lot of static on it. I had seen the documentary originally on cable and decided to order it to have as a keepsake, but as I just mentioned, the VHS I received from the distributor was not of the best quality.Winifred (Winnie)Day"
3,Eye Opening,"I had waited months to see this documentary. It's an eye opening piece that explores a side of World War II which was left completely untouched when I was in school. For some reason I kept expecting more though. It wasn't that things were really glossed over, yet I felt like I was missing something. The begining of the documentary is very indepth, but the ending of the war an the stories of the childern being reunited with their parents seemed very quick and almost glossed over."
5,excellant,"speedy delivery, great price, dvd and case like new, packing good. i was excited to find this dvd, i like history type movies. this story opens my eyes to another angle of the holocaust."
1,wood is warped,"I know this is not an expensive square, but anyway the wooden handle come twisted, wrapped, seems like the wood was wet when they made the handle.In other word useless as marking tool. I keep it anyway, I saved all the brass fittings and I made a new mahogany handle. I gave 2 stars just for thefittings and the steel blade."
4,Swanson Sliding T-Bevel,"I chose this product because I like Swanson products, they are well made and work well. My only complaint, i feel they could improve the finish on this product by sanding the edges, it is not a big deal but I feel it would finish this product off better. In saying that I would not hesitate to buy this T-Bevel again."
2,Bevel Gauge,"Save your money and buy another brand, the first time I used the gauge the brass came unglued and fell off. I like the lock on the gauge but the quality of the gauge is too poor."
1,Twisted of the gauge,"Because of the following two reasons, I only gave one star rating,First, most importantly, as a gauge, I could not find a flat surface.Second, poor machining and assembly brass fittings."
4,Good tool,"This is a good tool for the money. As I do not use it very often, it will suffice. If I was going to use it more often, I would purchase a better version."
2,Nice price but loud!,"Product has a great price in comparison to other sites but motor is very loud. Not a quiet dryer. Dries hair quickly but scares the dogs. Might be ok if using in a larger area, we are confined to a 20 x 20 room to groom."
1,Owner,This Dryer is extremely loud and the stand is to light to handle the force of air. Plus the Air is too strong for the dogs and upsetting to them !!! I would not recommend this dryer !!!!
5,Love it!,The word 'companion' really fits. Helps you with all sorts of baking issues. Its both a course in baking and a recipe book. The morning glory muffins alone are worth the price of the book. I have their whole grain book and its great too. One of the things I really like about their recipes is that they give you both weight and cup measurements. Weight is THE best way to measure flours.
5,Great resource,I teach middle school and find the easy read way this book is written a great plus. Over the summer I hope to go to their baking school. I think it would be a wonderful experience to include in my classes.
5,This is the go-to book on baking,"I bought book months ago and have made at least 10 different types of bread with it.Bread baking is very unforgiving and a slight variation in measuring or technique and not happy with results.My latest reason to smile was the light fruit cake recipe on pg 344. It was my first ever fruitcake, and it was the best fruitcake I've ever tasted.King Arthur takes time in this book to explain a lot of technique that new or experienced bakers can appreciate. Such as how to use proofing baskets, or a substitute, to make those wonderful round loaves one can't resist in better bread stores. And not only how to use baking stone, but also alternatives and some explanation on why they make better bread.This is one of the best book's I've ever bought"
5,Excellent resource,I finally went ahead and put post-it notes on the conversion charts (I've learned to weigh all my ingredients!) and the chocolate pound cake. An excellent resource for novice bakers who want a variety of information and recipes.
5,Move over Grandma,"Finally, a cook book worth the money. My Grandma would even be proud to pull these recipes out of her oven. Simple, straightforward approach to baking fabulous, yummy baked goods. Tried and true - you can't miss with this one!"
5,King Arthur Flour Baker Companion,"This is a great book, buy it FIRST, it covers in detail without the verbosity of many bread books, sourdough, poolish, biga, all the Artisan stuff that whole books on bread cover, plus a host of recipes for just about anything from cookies, cakes, waffles, to speciality deserts. This and a Joy of Cooking, and a few bread machine books should keep any body busy in the kitchen. Buy this book, check out the other ""big books"" like Bread Baker Apprentice, La Bri, etc. at your local library."
5,"Still the ""bible"" of baking","Just as good as it gets. A well thought out, clearly written book. Didn't expect any less from the King Arthur company. Kudos!"
1,for the 2012 edition,"I was excited to get this book because of the reviews for the older book and the great recipes on this site but this book is barely a step up. Today, most cookbooks are FULL of colored photos to give the reader an idea of what they are making.The recipes in this book have errors. Here is an example:page 296, chewy chocolate chip cookies calls for 1 egg, crunchy calls for 1 as well (page 297). On the photo page is featured a photo of the two chocolate chip cookies. The description reads ""chewy calls for two eggs whereas crunchy calls for one""Need I say more? I found barely any recipes for cookies or cakes (out of over 500 pages only a few?)I'll be returning this item. If you're interested, the chewy calls for no white sugar and corn syrup, look into it if chewy is your thing."
5,King Arthur Cookbooks are the BEST,"Everything King Arthur is fantastic. I have made many, many recipes from the King Arthur cookbooks and every one without exception has been phenominal. They perfect the recipes in their test kitchen and using their flour makes everything taste exquisite. I highly recommend this and all their other cookbooks....which I also own."
5,Amazing Cookbook,This cookbook has all the basic baking recipes you'll need plus so much more. I really love that it explains why to do things a certain way. It really expands the mind of the baker.
5,Best Baking Book!,A culinarys arts teacher highly recommeds this King Arthur book. It shipped quickly and was packaged well.
2,"Don't ""woo"" over this album!","Not a great start a Woo, and I highly wouldn't recommend this album. It's pretty boring, and about every song sounds pretty much the same. Some of her other stuff is better. The only thing I like on her is the cello background, and that's about it--there's too much accompaniment on here and not enough ""Woo"". The only tracks I like on here are Unshaken, A Little More, and the title track from this album."
3,Average low-budget vampire flick,"Graveyard Shift (now released under the title CENTRAL PARK DRIFTER) is just your average vampire flick. Nothing too spactacular, just a vampire cab driver taking his victems one by one. This movie is fairly well presented and has some artistic elements within its filming. Not one of my favorites, but I would recommend it to vampire film lovers. I've seen better vampire films, and I've seen a lot worse ones. There is also a sequel titled UNDERSTUDY: GRAVEYARD SHIFT II, but since GRAVEYARD SHIFT I has been released under CENTRAL PARK DRIFTER, I wonder if Understudy: Graveyard Shift II will ever be released on DVD. Maybe it also will be retitled to CENTRAL PARK DRIFTER II or manybe just UNDERSTUDY. I think Graveyard Shift was released under this alternate title maybe to avoid confusion with the Stephen King film of the same name? What do you think?"
5,Works Great!,"Highly recommend if you have gone through the Hooked on Phonics Kindergarten and 1st Grade levels!! My son went through HOP 2nd Grade over the summer and is again a year ahead of his class in Reading! He loved it! It has really helped build his self-confidence and really amazes other adults with his reading abilities! If you have more than one child you plan on using this curriculum with, laminate the reading charts so that you can reuse them!"
3,Corelle Hearthstone Stoneware,"Corelle Hearthstone Stoneware Round 16-Piece Set, Service for 4, Chili RedI was disappointed in the quality of the stoneware. I was expecting the stoneware to have a rough texture on top, not a ceramic finish. The bottom black finish is what I was hoping for. They are hard to store as the bottom of the plates scratch the shiny glossy finish."
3,Nice looking but poor quality control,"I have seen these plates at various stores and really liked the way they looked and the Corelle brand, so I ordered two sets from Amazon, one 16 piece red, one 16 piece Turmeric. I got the plates promptly and when my wife was taking them out, three of the red plates had a small stone fragment in the glaze, right in the middle of the plates; the Turmeric plates edge had a dent in it. Wow, four out of 32 is very bad QA. I went to my local store and had a hard time finding replacement plates without defects. If Corelle can improve their quality, these are a great deal."
5,Wonderful plates,"I got the Corelle Hearthstone Round 16-piece set in Chili Red when they were on gold box special. They were the perfect color of plate I needed. So I ordered it right away. When they came one of the bowls was chipped. I called amazon and they sent out another set that day and gave me a label to send back the rest. All I did was take out a bowl to add to the first set, throw away the chipped bowl and return the rest with the amazon pre-paid label.I love these dishes, they are so great. Corelle always makes a great product."
2,not what I was hoping for,"I didn't like the color of these dishes. They were more of a dark almost ""pinky"" red and didn't match my kitchen at all. I have the red toaster and can opener, etc, and these didn't match at all. As far as quality, they looked like they would be nice,but I didn't really use them after I saw the color wouldn't match. Its hard to tell from a picture, that is why I am letting you know. The other thing that I noticed is that your finger prints really show on the ""red"" part of the dishes"
4,"Lovely color, Great dishes!","Really the color is outstanding the perfect red not a fire engine red but a red that goes with everything. Even matches my old dishes. They are a good size for everyday and nice enough for special occasion usage.Hand washing them is easy because they don't go flying out of your hands like smooth back dishes can.Although, I would recommend some kind of place mat if eating on a wood table surface that can be scratched. All in all quite happy with them! Would love another set!Will check back after using them for a few months to update this review."
1,Beware this product and company!!,"I purchased two sets of this product (one red, one orange) within the last 6 months. While they are very pretty, they tend to break and peel in the dishwasher. I have lost two coffee cups, two bowls, and a plate...they broke or peeled in the dishwasher!! When I contacted the company for replacement with the ""ONE YEAR LIMITED WARRANTY"" I was told that since I didn't register (regardless of me having the original receipt) within 30 days, I was out of luck. But of course I could purchase individual replacement pieces. Save your money and buy something cheaper. It will probably last longer!!"
4,Nice set,This is a nice set. I am not sure I would pay full price as I got it on a lightening deal. The mug is red on the outside and black on the inside. I did not notice this when I choose the set. The others are opposite. They should be consistant.
2,Quality Control Department was on Vacation That Day,"Corelle Hearthstone Stoneware Round 16-Piece Set, Service for 4, Royal WhiteI ordered these dishes as a Christmas gift for my son and daughter-in-law, and was very disappointed that some of the plates were warped to the point that they wouldn't lie flat on the table. To its credit, Amazon quickly sent a replacement set. By going through both sets, my son was able to find a complete set of first-quality dishes. Nevertheless, I felt the gift was ""tainted"" by the extra effort that was required by those who received it."
2,I'm Sending them Back,I ordered the orange and the red. The colors were much more drab in person. The cumin is actually burnt orange from the 70s.
1,CHIPS EASILY!,"Initially, I loved these dishes. However, four pieces have chipped already and we have been using them for a little over a month! We are careful with them, but they are definitely NOT chip resistant!"
2,Didn't like the feel of these dishes,"I was disappointed when I received these dishes. The price was right, but I found the dishes to be really heavy and I didn't like the feel of the black underside of the bowls and plates. It was a scratchy sort of gritty feel. The red also was more muted (brickish?) and less vibrant than I'd hoped.We kept the dishes for a couple years to make ourselves feel okay about the purchase, but then switched to the classic Corelle dishes and are much happier."
5,Thank you Amazon...,I ordered the Chili Red and the Cumin Orange to mix and match on my table and I just love them. We ate off them for the first time last night and the best part of all is I ordered these dishes on one day and had them the next. It was unbelievable....thank you Anazon.
5,"Corelle Hearthstone Stoneware Turmeric Yellow Round 16-Piece Set, Service for 4","I purchased 3 sets of this dinnerware about a month ago. It was to replace another set that I had had for about 15 yrs or so--another Corelle or Corning set. I have always had Corelle sets with very few pieces broken over the years. Also, the 1 year break/chip guarantee on these sets surpassed the rest of the competition. I thought this was a great $ value in comparison with other competitors. This color is great--not too yellow and the black is a great contrast. They are heavy, but not too heavy and fit nicely in the dishwasher. I had considered the square sets, but decided against them from other reviews that they were very heavy and didn't fit in the dishwasher."
5,Just beautiful,I have just redone my kitchen in a deep burgundy and this set is perfect. The dishes are very rich looking. I got 3 sets and have some on my hutch to show them off. I had purchased a similar looking set at Target and took them back as they were too rough and the finish wasn't even. This set is perfect. The guarantee is amazing! A whole year of non chip!
3,SEXY AND CRUEL,"Dracula is really cruel in this movie. ""Torture"" is his middle name. The ""girls"" are beautiful: Christopher Lee must have enjoied biting Anouska Hempel's neck... it's a really sexy scene. Screenplay, actors(director's fault?) and lines are not convincing at all."
4,"nice ""scars""","i am a big hammer fan and really love the ""dracula"" series so i was happy to see this one hit dvd. christopher lee is the best vampires the movies ever had. turn down the lights and let the horror begin."
3,Not your Granddad's Dracula,"For most of the current generation, Christopher Lee remains the preeminent portrayer of Count Dracula on film, and his love/hate relationship with the role has been well documented. This small but effective film is one that he was fond of, however, if only due to the attempt to return to at least some of the themes and set pieces introduced in Bram Stoker's original novel (the scene of Dracula in full regalia climbing DOWN the sheer face of the castle wall like a bat is a standout). Although certainly not up to the classic standards of HORROR OF DRACULA or even the inferior DRACULA,PRINCE OF DARKNESS, this would be Lee's last period incarnation of the character before the whacked-out 70's versions that would forever bury the series. If you are a Lee fan, you will enjoy this title and want it for your Hammer Collection."
4,I simply loved it.,I have always loved the Gothic horror tale - from Bela Lugosi's Dracula and the rest of the Universal Horror family through the Hammer years and their various monster mashes. If you love period pieces and the old monster classic - you'll love this one. The Hammer films are much more edgy - pushing the envelop with regard to how they handle sex and nudity - but by today's standards they are pretty tame. The only Hammer Film I would say to avoid is the Circus of Vampires - very bad! I collect classic horror films and have all of the Universal films and most of the Hammer films - but the Circus is one I will not buy - for any price.If you like Christopher Lee/Bela Lugosi films - you'll love this one.Larry
2,"Dracula again? Well, at least he talks this time....","Chris Lee was so bored playing Dracula by this time (1970) that it seems to exude from his pores every second he is on camera! And yet, there is something about this, the last of Hammer's 'gothic' Draculas, that is strangely fascinating. Perhaps it's the fact that the story seems to fit nowhere into the previously established timeline, or is it the bizarre idea that the villagers think they can burn Dracula to death, or is it ex-Dr.Who's Patrick Troughton incredible performnace as Dracula's once-previously killed manservant Klove? Or is it all the weird sadism present in the story, or possibly yet is it the novel way that Dracula meets his death, struck by lightning? Personally, I think it's because Lee actually has something to do than skulk around cellars and chimneys, and something to say than just hiss out monosyllabic orders! Is it great? No! Is it worth watching? Well, that's up to you! I like it, anyway...."
3,In My Own Humble Opinion.....,"By 1970 when this bit of film was released into the world, I believe that the writers were running out of good ideas. Compared to ""Horror of Dracula"" from 1958, ""Scars of Dracula"" is kinda lame and the bats are incredibly fake looking. Nice try - it's better than watching the walls collect dust."
3,"Nice DVD, but poor Hammer fare","If you're a fan of Christopher Lee's Dracula, than you'll probably want a copy of this film on DVD to complete your collection. The transfer looks and sounds pretty good and is on par with the other Anchor Bay Hammer releases. The film itself is the last of the Hammer Dracula's set in ""Victorian"" times before the update in ""Dracula AD 1972"". The plot is typical Hammer vampire fare, and Dracula has very little to do here but bare his fangs and snarl. Lee, as always, invests his portrayal of the Count with glaring evil...but he seems tired of the entire affair. The film is considered by many to be the nastiest of the Hammer Dracula films, which may be true. Overall, it is a very average film and it you are not a serious Lee/Hammer/Dracula collector, you might prefer the DVD version of ""Dracula, Prince of Darkness""."
2,One of the more disappointing entries in the series,"Two villagers go and search for a kidnapped friend of their's and meet up with the man who took him, guess who? Despite some original scenes (one of them is the door opening by itself for Christopher Lee) and Lee's dynamite performance this, along with DRACULA HAS RISEN FROM THE GRAVE is not really as good as many of the other films in Hammer's series of DRACULA movies in fact, it's pretty dull."
3,Ok better than Taste the blood of Dracula - 1970,this is ok but one part they messed up. In Taste the Blood of Dracula he falls on the alter in the Chapel and decomposes to dust that is in London.... Here we begin in Transylvania and Dracula remains are spread over More like a Rock and the most fake looking bat comes and spits blood on his remains thats it and he rises agian and the story starts afresh
4,"Not the best, but the most horiffic of the entire series!","Great movie although I still say ""Horror Of Dracula"" was the best of them all. This film is the best of the sequels. Only one confusing part of it though. In ""Taste The Blood Of Dracula"", he is destroyed and rots away into dust at that ruined church. ""Scars"" begins, presumably, right after that film, yet we see Dracula's remains lying on a stone slab at a castle. How did this happen? Did someone pick up his dust at the church and then sprinkle it in the castle? Maybe it was the bat who comes in to drip blood on the remains? Who knows?In any case, this was a rather good film. Unlike the previous one, Dracula is present for nearly the entire film this time. And, a great demise at the end this time.If you buy any of the Hammer ""Dracula"" films, stick with this and the previous ones. Stay away from the ones that take place in the 20th century. Not the same."
3,this Dracula serie lacks of Van Helsing,"here are some reasons, why this series becomes one of the weakest Hammer's British Dracula: 1. The very weak priest can't fight against the evil spirit, the actor has not a big talent and the role is not strong enough as Peter Cushing was. 2. The female stars are acting really awful 3. Dennis Waterman has no immense charisma to fight the almighty Dracula, neither does Chris Matthews (Paul). 4. The most worst of all is: Christopher Lee felt very boring to play the same role as Count Dracula. One can notice clearly that his acting was embarrassing and tedious during the movie set. Lee failed to balance the role in this film, which the excellent performance of Bela Lugosi had already appeared 40 years earlier"
4,At long last...Canadian aviation history!,"This long, long, long awaited effort is to be admired for the depth and completeness in the authors' dedication to detail. They've filled the bill about the ""what-went-where"" data and is worthy to have in hand when researching and referencing the history of military aircraft in Canada's ""Forces."" BUT, be advised, the real drawback and disappointing aspect of this book is the photos and their reproduction. Poor half-tones, poor originals, ""air-show"" amateur examples mar what could have been a true campanion volume to their original effort of 30+ years ago. And after 30+ years...not one color photo? Shelf-worthy but no eye-candy."
1,heat tape,the heat tape i purshed did not work...i was very disappointed i just took it for granted it would so i didn't save the box or paper work..
3,USA still the best !,"I'm a reseller of tools and equipment, so I did alot research before I bought this model. My customer had a limited budget so finding the lathe to fit it was a challenge. All the reviews about this unit were good and it was the major reason I bought it. The first day my customer used it broke, the main drive gear broke inside the gear box. The vendor was great about addressing the problem. The the only problem with them was I had to instruct them on how to take there machine apart so I could get the replacement part. The other problem was the distance between us, east coast-west coast, two weeks was lost due to delivery times. The original reason why I had a problem with the first gear box is there was no lubricant in the gear box, the replacement was good."
1,Where are the Loons?,"I purchased this cd in the hopes I would be enveloped in the sounds of the loon. I was extremely disappointed. If you like the sounds of summer - crickets, frogs, rain, etc., then you will like this cd. I found it as hard finding the loons on this cd as finding them in my backyard. The only good thing was the quality of the recording."
2,where are the loons?,I agree with J. Motto - a beautifully recorded soundscape as is usual from Wild Sanctuary but a misleading title - the peepers will drive you crazy while you wait for the very infrequent loon calls - why not a recording of loons in the evening? - on my canoe trips in the Canadian north the loon 'symphonies' are extraordinary.
1,Underwater Volume 2,"Save your money. This is without a doubt the worst album I have ever bought. Darren Emerson delivers a completely rubbish set, nowhere even near his usual standards. As far as mutiny goes, my ears are ready for a mutiny, I don't know how these guys even qualify to have there own mix CD, never mind charging over 30 Dollars for it. This CD right now is currently residing Underwater, as I chucked it into Lake Ontario after the first painful listen."
3,Honestly... Just way too housey for me.,"The first two songs on Darrens side are probably my most liked tracks, but the rest of the cd sounds like they just threw something together. Well i really wouldnt go as far to say that, because i do really like Emersons Dj technique, but i'm not a Disco House person. if you're really into funky house & crazy offbeat synths, you should buy this cd... otherwise save your $$$"
5,breaker breaker,Breaker went in box like it was designed for. Operation is fine. No visible defects or appearance of second quality. I would buy again.
5,order,"I think this is a good product,this company was a good company to do business with will do business again"
3,Check the connection openings!,"This breaker does not fit all panels. It's bottom opening is 3/5"". My breakers are 3/4"". Make sure you measure and confirm you're getting the correct size.The bottom part that connects to the connectors in the breaker panel is smaller."
1,tape deck in coat pocket!,"when i saw this cd listing, i was like very cool, not much documented with this line-up of the ian gillan band!bought the cd,because i love this version of the gillan band,put it on and said i got screwed!!!..the sound quality is very shotty like it was secretly recorded in someones coat jacket!maybe there is another version out there somewhere,but this isn't it!please avoid until you see a sticker on the cover saying great soundboard recording,as zappa says save your money,don't go to the show!"
3,Another crap release from Angel Air,"In typical Angel Air fashion, the label gutted this concert so they could squeeze it onto a single disc.The decision to massacre the setlist seems to have been made without consideration for the fans. There has been a bootleg of this show (with much better quality) floating around trading circles for years. I've included the setlist from the bootleg to demonstrate just how much is missing from this release. The three star rating is for the music and not the shoddy way it was released. From a fans perspective, this is a disgrace. Buy at your own risk, you've been warned.The bootleg looks like this:CD1:Clear Air TurbulenceMoney LenderChild In TimeMy Baby Loves MeMercury HighOver The HillCD2:What's Your GameScarabusTrying To Get YouTwin ExhaustedSmoke On The WaterRock'n Roll Medley:- Lucille- Jailhouse Rock- High School Confidential- Whole Lotta Shakin Goin On- Lucille - repriseWoman From Tokyo"
1,Worst sound quality ever,"I bought this album at 80% off on the last day Tower Records was in business ... and I still feel I got ripped off. It's REALLY too bad, because it seemed liked Ian and the boys were a really smoking unit. Unfortunately, though, the sound quality sounds like it was recorded on a cheap tape player by someone standing OUTSIDE the arena. Unbelievably bad. This is ONLY for hard-core Gillan fans, if that. For everyone else, just put on Deep Purple's ""Made In Japan"" and call it a day."
2,Not the best.,"Although I really like Trixie Beldens and am a big fan of hers, I didn't like this one very much. She has to spend much of her time studying and the mystery is not scary or anything. It's really not even a mystery!"
1,Trixie Beldon and the mystery of the uninvited guest,"For and assignment, I read this book. After the first twenty pages, I found that I wanted to, throw it away in a burn barrel and then burn that too. It was a predictable, poor exuse of a mystery novel. The only mystery here was why I chose it in the first place.It had a bad setting,in the 40's or something,where everything was a mystery, including cereal. It was a predictable at every turn and easily solved for the reader less than halfway through. It was an unrealistic and fake sounding, let alone ""looking"" book.In conclusion, I hated the stupid bundle of paper. It had the worst setting ever in any book in my displeasure to read from slimy cover to sticky end. And who in their right mind says ""Gleeps""? That is the most stupidest thing I have ever heard."
5,Captivating!,Definitely a great read! This book adresses the politics and agency of women of color in the reproductive rights movement.
3,Slick; but still need a learning curve.,"I have had the jig for about 2 weeks now and have been using 1/2"" plywood for my material with a 1/8"" spacer board under the top sheet.I have fiddled this thing every which way but have yet to come up with a perfect; even nice fit.My attempts leave me with too tight; too loose; too much overhang; too little overhang.I get the feeling and it is truly a feeling I am getting better but the pile of dovetail scrap sticks I have built up would lend one to think otherwise.A help would be a depth of cut gauge built into it or supplied extra. I see some more expensive sets have them and, that would make a difference of sorts."
4,marrid with childern,"i have all eight seasons i cant wait for season 9 to come out the bundys are a very stupid but they sure are funny. for a good belly laugh i do recomend this show,But beware the bundys dont teach good morals."
3,Reason for 3 stars,"Watch it Bundy Fans and make sure you read some reviews when it is released. Hey SONY is this gonna be another EDITED VERISON like last season, if so maybe that should be put that on the case. Why buy somethig if it's only 75% of the true show. I know before I get sucked in and dish out 30.00 plus like the last season I'm gonna be reading some reviews and if it is edited I 'll just keep on watching my old VCR tapes and fast foward through the commericals."
2,Downhill Bundy,"Married with children has been my favorite comedy tv show for a long time. Unfortunately, on the fifth season the show begins to lose the style and focus that made it so great. Al changes completely. He goes from a struggling shoe salesman who gets no respect from his wife or kids(or from no one for that matter)to a bully. He does'nt get a lot of lip from Peg anymore, which was hilarious to watch from the previous seasons. I think that was the funny subject of the show, how no nobody would listen to him or respect him, and still he would go on. All that changed during the fifth season, changing completely the focus,style (and the quality of the storylines)of the series."
2,Advice: Don't Buy It!,"I'm in the middle of the second episode and the part with the opening music gone has just ruined the whole mood of the set. I had heard that it was missing, but I said, 'so what'? Well it turned out to be a major ,'so what'.I don't even feel like I'm watching the Bundy's. This is worse than some bootleg. I wish I hadn't bought it, even for only $13.49. Now, I've got to deal with season four, that I ordered, and it's on it's way, ikk!"
2,don't bother,"Whatever is covered in this text is easily found surfing the net. I thought I would find something more substantial, but it just reiterates what I've already found for free. Don't bother."
1,Very disappointend!,"I bought this poster over a month ago, for a gift to my daughter. I still have not received it yet."
3,This book would be amazing if they proofread it,"Helpful categories, well organized, and could really use the services of a good proofreader. It's full of typos. ""2001"" is translated as ""1999"", there are a number spelling errors in the Dutch. This book was apparently written for the UK market, and when they decided to adapt it to the US market, they didn't change the translations. ""I am American"" is translated as ""I am English"", ""These are the details of my bank in the United States"" is translated as ""These are the details of my bank in the United Kingdom"", ""dollars"" is ""English pounds"". If you get past those issues, it's pretty helpful for basic and useful phrases."
3,Good product for price,"Purchased head covers for Cowboys fan as I couldn't find them in New England. Fast easy shipping, arrived within 5 business days. Decent product for the price..."
4,"Yes, but","Here you get to hear John Williams when he was very young; I think he was around 17 years old when he recorded this album. He was already a great artist. ""Nortena"" alone makes this recording worth having."
5,This album is hot!,"It's not quit as hot as the drummer, but then, what is? Chris makes the sun look like a frigid ball of ice. Most people evolved from lower life forms, but Chris was formed by the collision of diamond particles and gold dust during the first few moments of the big bang. It's rumored that Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston actually split up because of Jennifer's undying infatuation with Chris. Of course, Chris is way too hot for Jennifer, and she's still trying to get over the heart-wrenching pain of his rejection. Do yourself a favor and buy this album. You won't regret it."
2,Not Terribly Compelling,"This is my first Thrasher novel and I was far from impressed. The switching back and forth in time did not work for me. I really felt the book was more about people being sloshed and less about remorse for wasted years. Yet, I get the impression the author was trying to focus more on the latter. I was not terribly compelled and in the end, I cared little about the characters and only wanted to know what had happened on spring break. I also noticed a switch in language. For the first 3/4 of the book, the author carefully avoided the Lord's name in vain and by the end, he through in several. It did not make for good character continuity either. Overall a mediocre read with mostly unlikeable characters."
4,Thrasher rocks!,"Honestly, I don't normally read books like this. I like thrillers, action, and mystery, and at first glance that didn't really describe this book. However, I am a recent Thrasher fan so I am reading all of his books and this one happened to be next. I really enjoyed it, and it turned out to be very engaging and (surprise!) mysterious. I think it will be enlightening to people who think everyone who attends a Christian college fits into a certain mold or is there for the same reasons. I thought I had the ending figured out, but the ending really surprised me. I doubt you will be disappointed with this book."
2,Admission,"I may be the only person who did not enjoy this book. I found it hard to even finish it. I have liked and read others by him, some of which were very good. This one I found myself putting down, then skimming through just to end it. Maybe it is my age, but the jumping back and forth, the college years, the not knowing what the crime was and then even when finding it out, it all left me annoyed.The fact that I have read very good books by this author makes me wonder why this one just did not have it."
4,"Compelling Christian thriller, ending a let down","Admission by Travis Thrasher is a well-written psychological thriller. Jake Williams left college 15 years ago and hasn't spoken to any of his friends since. But he's blackmailed into searching for his former best friend by events that he can't remember regarding their last days in school and the death of another friend. Thrasher does a great job of feeding out only a little information at a time to the reader, and because even the narrator doesn't have the answers, it doesn't feel forced. He also does a good job of dealing with Williams' faith in God: the faith of a new believer uncertain how to talk about it and still struggling to stay on the narrow path. The true flaw in the book is the overly quick resolution. The story quickly jumps ahead after the killer is revealed, and I felt shortchanged. Just one more chapter could have smoothed over those rough spots."
5,wrong price,"This CD cost new $13.99 including shipping. Amazon supposed to be cheaper, what happened?"
3,Useless for any internet savvy experienced traveler,"I bought this book based on all the 5 star reviews. I found the book useless except for a couple of tips.I am internet savvy and travel enough that the web tips and travel tips were all old news. I wish I had not bought this book.I can see how someone that is new to using the internet for booking travel would find this useful. However, if you know your way around sites like [...] you won't find this book useful."
2,Great Read!,"She has some really fundamental ideas one might not have thought of. Also, she doesn't give too much detail on things such as airfares, she tells of the basic, but not lots of details, although she does have good info on other things."
3,Not the best rice,"Took way to long to arrive from the seller, and it wasn't the real good quality basmati rice. The grains after being cooked, really don't separate that well."
5,Lo mejor de lo mejor; Y como es que es Gisselle !,"Gisselle es actualmente una de las merengueras del momento, su musica tiene un ritmo sensacional,inigualable, yo personalmente lo recomiendo no solo este cd, los recomiendo todos, y le doy 5 estrellas."
2,Needs Updating,"Contains some decent tips but disappointing overall. Lacks treatment of the issue of restricted funds, essential to non-profit budgeting. Does not provide insight into effective use of spreadsheet programs like Excel which are essential to budget building. Does not show modern methods for calculating overheads like the FTE system. Contains a plethora of forms that can be used in various stages of the budget building process."
3,Do the research!,"Before buying a Triton, make sure you research the correct MODEL. You should view and read the reviews on the Triton Pro Ultimate model (a bit more expensive than the Ultimate) here on Amazon, but it may answer more of your questions. I have a review on that page that may be helpful.....and one year later, I still think there are pros and cons. It is good for neighborhood cruising, and for exercising the dog on relatively flat surfaces. It is NOT for hills, super-fitness riding, or high speed work-outs. A definite ""con"" is the poor quality of the rear tires, and even though I have repalced them with high quality tires from the local bike shop, there is an excessive wear pattern that (I believe)is due to poor bike design. I list more details in my other review under ""Triton Pro Ultimate."""
2,small,"I purchased this for my wife who is five feet tall.It fits her, but is too small, it needs a larger wheel in the front.I bought the next larger size for myself, which she has assumed.They are alright, but, need gearing and more front wheel traction. If you get off the pavement,(by accident or because the paement ends) the Mobo (either size)is useless. The front wheel spins in place, yes a lot of exercise but no forward motion.Buy a regular bike for exercise or use the Mobo as a stationary bike for exercise."
1,Description online is incorrect.,The description online states it is for adults. It is for kids. we have since discovered you have to look at the length of the bike. It should tell you from small to largest length. Amazon was good about refunding our money.
5,Triton 3-Wheeled Adult Tricycle,"I love it! I have a spinal disability and the Triton helps me get exercise I can't normally get (walking, running, gym workouts, etc). I'm also over 50 and when I got on the Triton it made me feel like a kid again. I actually found myself laughing at myself while I was riding. The neighbors had a blast checking it out, too!"
1,Trike is ok but customer service is the pits,"I received my trike with high hopes. My bad. The trike was surprisingly to assemble, about 1 1/2 hours, taking my time. After assembly I gave it a test run, and was overjoyed with its having exceeded my expectations. I rode it approximately 1 block, but having family visiting from afar, waited until they left the next morning. Wow, now is the time to give m trike a real run. I did not even get out of the (short) driveway and the pedal just quit working. Here is where my satisfaction took a nose dive. Customer service, at every step, was almost nil. The one human I did succeed in talking with was nasty, and of absolutely no help.I sincerely hope others have a better experience."
5,LOVE it!,I bought one for fun and my 67 yr old mom rides it when she is visiting. It is easy to put together and rides fairly smooth. Great buy for the price and kind of exercise that you get from it!
2,Not what I ordered.,"I bought one of these for my wife who has has extensive back surgery. The wrong one was sent and it was nothing like what the description explained. Though it was in great condition, it was the wrong size and it turned out to be a childs Cruiser. The seat and seat back were very stiff and would not have been comfortable for my wife--especially on rough pavement. It wasone speed and would have been difficult for her to peddle up even the slightest hills. I have to say that Amazon was very helpful and apologetic. They were a pleasure to work with in returning the Cruiser and refunding my money."
4,Three-Wheel Cruiser,"I bought this for my grandaughter for Christmas. She really likes it. It is giving her alot of needed exercise. All the adults tried it also, and now she has to compete with them to use it. I little pricey, but hopefully it will last a long time."
5,Happy,My son is thrilled with this bike. Everyone wants to try it. So fun. Very well made. I had the local bike shop put it together.
2,Is this really a Schwinn?,"My first bike--many years ago was a Schwinn. Bought this trike based on that experience. But the trike is not as well manufactured; back fender brackets too short to allow clearance over and above the tire; steers to the left, front brakes could not be adjusted even by a bike assembler. Without rear fenders it is rideable. It will take a while to adjust to the quirks and foibles of a trike as opposed to a bike. I keep practicing and with a whole lot more practice expect to truly enjoy the vehicle. Assembly booklet needs drastic improvements and revisions."
1,poorly made cheap,this is one of the most poorly made products on the market. Don't waste your money. Within 30 days I had to replace the rear tires. After that the brakes broke and then withing 6 months and less than 20 times used one of the pedals fell off and now will not stay on. This was well cared for and not handled roughly. It is very cheaply made and the seat is extremely uncomfortable (very hard).
2,why?,"three hundred dollars for what amounts to a glorified child's tricycle? It's a single speed, so don't expect to go very fast. (think of a unicycle, same arrangement.)If you're going to spend this much, look into a recumbent, same seating position.I like how ""steve"" has squeezed in four of his biased reviews, looks like he works for the company with his plugs that read like a 'paid actor.'"
2,Flimsy,"Not only did this take an adult to put together, but one touch and pieces break. I broke a few pieces just getting them into place. I had to hot-glue it to hold it together, another reason I'm not sure this should be for kids. You cannot play with it once it's together. If you want to put it together and display it on a shelf, then this would be perfect."
5,Hobby,Originally bought to put together in order add to my hobby. Ended up giving as a gift to my brother who was in the Army.
2,Cheap Puzzle Toy,"I was not terribly impressed with this puzzle. The instructions are difficult to decipher and pieces do not hold together well. Do not buy this for a child as it cannot be played with. Once you put it together if you want to put it on a shelf and never breath on it then fine. Once it is put together it looks pretty nice, but I do not recommend that you purchase."
3,Mower Blade,"The blades were not star hole as stated. They did work, good thing my man is a mechanical guy. The service was lighting fast."
2,Too Thick,"This marker is too thick for most pieces. It's as thick as highlighter and most gunpla pieces are so small that this thing can hardly be used. This is definitely not for panel lines. If you have large pieces that you want to color, this is a pretty good one."
5,Great book,Heart of the Warrior was a great book. I am only collecting books written by Lindsay McKenna. She is a great author.
5,Safety,"A prefect fit for my new workshop sub panel.Instead of having GFCI outlets, I simply used these GFCI breakers. It makes adding outlets to weather proof sockets simpler - no more trying to cram a large GCFI outlet in to the enclosure.I have two main lugs that also use these model of breakers, and they all work just fine."
2,Petite Garland,"The lamp was smaller than I thought, It arrive with no cord to insert the light bulb. I also bought a Midsummer so I used that one. Still I like it."
2,Unsatisfied customer poor quality batteries,I was very unsatisfied I recieved these batteries on time like shipping was said. When I recieved them I charged Them Like the direction's said When charging was done I put plastic cover on them and put in my camera case.when went to use them I put on camera after about 3 minuts battery symbol came on then started to flash then went dead after 5 minuts. Same thing happend with next one. I was not happy with quality of battery's ended up having to plug power cord into wall outlet and use camera. I guess you get what you pay for.Thank's anywaysTom
5,Nice,"I bought this shirt for my kids to give my husband when I was having our 3rd child. My husband thought it was adorable. People always make comments when he wears it :-)Very cute shirt, good fit too."
4,dangerous beauty,The text leaves a little to be desired but buy this book for the photos from the Daily Mail's archive...truly unseen.
4,Good acne coverup,"I have a problem with cystic adult acne and am a TERRIBLE pimple picker. I cut these into small pieces and use them to cover pimples that are draining so that I'm not tempted to pick the scabs off them and draw out the cycle. It matches my skin tone extremely well - I actually will wear it under my makeup if it's not in an overly obvious area. It is a little too thick to look normal if it's in the middle of my forehead or on my nose, though. Not at all irritating and pretty easy to pull off. Overall a great product, but it would be great if they could make an even thinner version specifically for the face."
5,Same item but cheaper,"This is the same item we had been getting from our local drug store, but much cheaper, and it came in just a few days. We were very pleased with the product and the service."
5,They should sell this in the stores,"Why don't they sell this at Walgreens / CVS / Rite-Aid?I had a nasty fall and didn't have these available. I bought 8 J&J; toughpads and over-lapped them to cover a couple large skin rash areas, but these would have been so handy.I now have a few packs of these thanks to Amazon. They should sell these in stores!! Amazing modern healing stuff."
3,They work... kinda...,"Using in a high pressure situation and the adhesive kind of leaks out around the edges, they tend to get stuck to your clothes or anything they come in contact with."
2,Too heavy,"I ordered two sets of these dishes and find them very heavy and actually a bit to large for fitting comfortably in the cupboards. The shape is not uniform in all the plates, some are more flat than others so they don't stack well. All in all I would have been better off going for the basic Corelle rather than these. Guess these will wind up in the garage sale when I find another square set that are lighter and a bit smaller."
4,Really big,"These dishes are really big and very heavy. They do fit in my cabinets and dishwasher but not the microwave. I bought the Indigo Blue, a very nice color but it shows fingerprints easily and that makes the dishes look dirty. Customer service has been excellent which is great because one bowl arrived broken and a dinner plate chipped after just three weeks (my husband swears he was careful!). The other problem I have, and my husband says it's just me, is that the sides of the plates curl and my fork and knife are always rolling off. These are nice plates but I think if I had seen them at the store I would not have bought them."
4,Hearthstone,"I have been a Corelle user since it first came out in the late '60's. I loved my Corelle and always had great cooperation from the company, which is why I was so surprised when I washed my new Hearthstone in the dishwasher and the black backside on one plate came out with a huge chip (?). It seemes to have just flaked off several layers in a 1/12"" spot.Since I had gotten it on-line I had no idea what to do about it. Any suggestions? Otherwise I am completely happy with it. The dinner plates are very generous in size and all in all it is a very attractive set."
4,Corelle Hearthstone Stoneware Bay Leaf Green Square,"Deep rich color and great workmanship make these dishes a pleasure to look at and eat on. They are heavy, so be careful when you load the dishwasher."
4,Beautiful Table Setting,"I really like the stoneware. I bought the red round and the yellow square. The yellow are heavier, but they look great together!They both have large mugs that I really like!"
3,Measure before you buy...plates too big for standard cupboard.,"I was thrilled to see these colors available in dinnerware and immediately brought two sets home. Then, sadly, I could not close my cabinet door when the plates were stacked inside!! Turns out the plates are 11 1/2"" wide and standard kitchen cabinets are 11"" deep. What were they thinking?? I Hope Corelle will use these colors again in dishes that fit in American cupboards."
5,I am in love with these dishes,"I got my sets a couple years ago on Amazon black Friday. They were on sale for half off, like $33 so I ordered 2 sets. When they arrived I was instantly in love. They are beautiful. I got Chili red. I bought the 2 sets just in case I had a large Christmas meal, or in case a dish or two broke over time. They are hard to store in standard cabinets but we make it work. In 2-3 years I have absolutely no complaints about these dishes. No chips, no scratches and I receive lots of complements about this set.P.S. To every person who complained that the 11 1/2 inch dishes were to large therefor you were disappointed, the actual size of the dishes is listed on Amazon if you bothered to look at the description. So the fault is truly your own."
2,Loved everything except its size and weight,"I saw these dishes in Wal-Mart in another color and ordered them from here in the color (turmeric Yellow) that I liked for even less money than at Wal-Mart. I received them quickly and loved the color and the way they looked. However, I returned them when I realized how big they were. The dinner plate fit in my microwave, but it was so big that it wouldn't allow the plate to turn while cooking. They wouldn't fit in my dishwasher on one side either--too tall. The bowls were so big that they were really heavy to hold while eating--like on the couch with a bowl of ice cream. They were all pretty heavy and I felt like I would have to be careful of which cupboard I stored them in. I also couldn't get all the bowls in the usual spot I keep them, because only 2 stacks instead of 3 or 4 would fit. I'm still looking for dishes as pretty as these are. Hope someone can find room for them, because they are beautiful and seem like great quality."
3,Corelle Stoneware Evaluation,My order was beautifully packaged however one of the plates (large had a crack near the edge) When I contacted Amazon I was told I would need to send the whole set back to get that plate replaced. I couldnt do this because I could not lift the box to repack it. Plus all the time and trouble. All I wanted was a replacement plate. I was told it was return or adjustment to bill. I had to accept adjustment to charge which I have not noticed yet on my statement. That is not at all what I would have chosen.
4,Chipped already!!!,"Bought these sets in blue, yellow & red. Look absolutely gorgeous on the table. Have only had them for a month, and some are scratched from normal everyday use. Then I found a dried piece of food after washing a dinner plate, attempted to pick it off and a small bit of blue came right off with it. Don't misunderstand, they really are gorgeous and I love them, I just wish they would have looked new longer. Also, there are no complementary pieces available yet, Corelle said they are ""waiting to see how well this sells"" before producing them in response to my email requesting info on where to purchase. I am presently in the process of contacting Corelle again, this time regarding the chip/scratch warrantee, so wish me luck..."
3,Won't fit in dishwasher or cabinets,"I bought two of these sets for my wife for Christmas. She removed the plates to store in the cabinet but they were too large - the door would not close. She also tried them in the dishwasher. Again, plates too big. Both our cabinets and dishwasher are standard size, not small versions. If the plates were standard size, we would have kept them. Because of this, we returned them and looked for other dinnerware sets."
5,Great Sturdy Hefty Set! Good Proportions.,"This set is great becuase of it's sturdy, hefty feel and ample size. The mugs hold an amazing 14oz and still manage to look chic and warm. The dinner plate is massive and allows for great plating ideas and space for a variety of different sized portions. I know most people complain about the size but my family loves it. We like to eat mountains of food so we have no use for flimsy dinnerware - for that we buy paperplates!"
5,I love these dishes,"I love the color, which is darker than the picture. I ordered 2 sets, only 1 plate broke. It wasn't worth the trouble to return the whole set to replace it. The dishes are large as other reviewers have reported. They fit fine in my cabinet."
2,Pretty But Huge & Heavy,"We've had this set for years. The dishes are a beautiful color and they are sturdy. However, the dishes are very heavy and not conducive to everyday usage. The dinner plates are also oversized and cannot fit into our current cabinetry. The are either being Craigslisted or going to Goodwill."
2,My set of Hearthside,"They are too heavy, they do chip and they scratch while being stacked. I really dont like them for the fact of being to heavy"
3,Heavy.,"Okay, these are GOR-GEOUS! Really, really gorgeous! But as daily dishes--- um... cumbersome! I've used them as serve-ware at parties to serve finger food, so for that, AWESOME. I haven't used the cups at all."
2,nice just scratch to easy,started out going wow what a great set and as they were used started looking much older and used that they were.must be a better solution for the money
2,Not Chili red,"Dishes are nice - heavy and larger than average. Quality is good.However, the color was NOT the same as the description or even the picture on the box. Dishes that are supposed to be 'Chili red' are actually more of a mauve pink color. VERY Dissapointing."
4,FINE SET,"I LIKE THIS DINNERWARE A LOT; IT IS HEAVY AND OVERSIZED, BUT FITS MY DISHWASHER. IT DID ARRIVE BADLY PACKED AND BROKEN THE FIRST TIME AROUND, AND I HAD TO RETURN THE WHOLE SET FOR ONE BROKEN BOWL. I WAS FURIOUS, BUT THE NEW SET ARRIVED IN A FEW DAYS AND, ALTHOUGH POORLY PACKED, IN ONE PIECE. IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS WORTH THE TROUBLE. A LOVELY BLUE, AND STURDY. THE PROBLEM IS THE PACKING, NOT THE DINNERWARE ITSELF."
3,Just too big,"These dishes are beautiful, but they're just too big. They don't fit well in my dishwasher, and take up a lot of space in the cupboard."
5,An excellent choice if you want oversized plates and bowls!,"These dishes are good-looking and durable. They fit nicely in the cupboard under the counter, and they fit in our dishwasher if we angle them slightly."
4,Pleased,I am very happy with this stoneware.Love the shape and that the bowls are a good size for salad or soup.
5,Corelle stoneware,The Corelle Hearthstone Stoneware Square is a wonderful dinnerware set!!!!The weight is heavy and the surface is nice and large. When you first see them you are amazed at how nice they look. I recommend them highly!!!
4,Impressive!,Love these dishes. I have had a little over a month. A little heavy but very nice. I have owned Corelle dishes for 30 years and am very impressed with this set. Hope you will be too.
4,Big,I Love this set. The dinner plates are huge so some may have trouble fitting them in a cabinet. I use the salad plates quite a bit so we don't eat too much. These are great for dinner parties; I use a red and blue set together it makes the table very festive.
5,Great product,I bought these dishes for my sister for Christmas. She loved them and so do I. The shipment fast and I did not have to pay for shipping and handling charges.
5,Corelle Hearthstone Stoneware,"We love these dishes, and 2 weeks later the price for the sets went down $10. After contacting amazon via email, they refunded my credit card for the price difference!!"
5,Very nice color,"These were just what I wanted, and they go nicely with the bay leaf set. They are slightly bigger and thicker than I'd prefer, which makes it a bit hard to fit them into the dishwasher as intended. Otherwise no complaints."
4,gorgeous set!,this is a heavy and durable set. i loved the chili red color and that the inside of the mugs have texture. the only problem i have with them is that you can't move them around too much when you stack them up in your cabinet. the white bottom part of the plate will leave small scratches on the plate beneath it. you just have to be careful not to rub them together. other than that these are just beautiful and i love the shape.
4,Nice but big,"I am happy with the stoneware set. The style and color (green) are great. However, the dinner plates do not fit in the dishwasher and are somewhat heavy (not surprising for stoneware). The plates and bowls are so large that I sometimes use them as serving pieces!"
3,Beautiful But...,These dishes are so pretty and the price is good but...2 dishes arrived broken. (I doubt if I can get the just those two replace but I still have to check.) Also these dishes are HUGE. The dinner plates are very heavy and they won't fit in most of our cupboards. They don't fit in our dishwasher either so I will have to wash them by hand. PLEASE take this into consideration if you are thinking about using these as every day plates. They look like something from a fancy restaurant. I still LOVE corelle dishes and I will be looking for something a bit smaller in the future.
2,Had to return it.,"I'm surprised you requested this review because I returned the item. Theywere just what I wanted, color and all, but when I tried to put the dinnerplates in the dishwasher they only fit if I placed them using two spaces.This reduced the dishwasher capacity. Next problem surfaced when the samedinner dishes didn't fit in my standard sized kitchen cabinet."
2,WHAT WERE YOU THINKING CORELLE?,"The overwhelming majority of American homes come with 11 inch deep kitchen cabinets - it's a standard. Don't you people bother to at least pretend to know your customers? The plates are beautiful, drop me a note whenever you make them in a size that is reasonable."
2,NOT BLUE!,"I loved the shape, size, and weight of these dishes. Yet, 10 minutes after arriving I've already filled out the form to return them. THEY ARE NOT BLUE. They are flat out, straight up PURPLE. When they say ""Indigo Blue"" they mean more indigo and less blue. If you order these, don't expect them to be the pretty blue in the picture. They are nice plates though, and I will order another set, just in a color that's not purple."
2,But it's NOT Corelle.,"Nowhere on the packaging, on the box, on the warranty can I find the name Corelle. Very misleading. Very heavy, very large. Will not fit in our cabinets. Measure before you buy."
5,Solid,"I shipped two of these dish sets to Central Africa, and every piece arrived intact. The dishware is very sturdy and much heavier than conventional Corelle. The mugs and bowls are a nice large size for a big cup of coffee or dinner-size serving of soup. I also read once that you eat less when your plates are small and blue, so I usually serve dinner on the smaller plates. Overall, this set is high-quality, and I have received many compliments on it."
5,Solid and sturdy,"I bought 2 sets for my parents and really thought this was the ""will not break b/c it's melamine"". This is not the Corelle found in the superstores, so don't be mistaken. Straight up stoneware. Plates are nicely sized and very solid. Bowls are deep enough, and cups are perfect. Corelle did a wonderful job of designing this set. If I need any more tableware, will definitely consider this, maybe in red.BTW, [...] did a superb job of shipping these items. Packaged with care (mfg boxes insulated within another big box). No damage at all. And fast!"
2,Too Heavy,I ordered this product online not knowing how heavy and thick the plates and bowl would be. I assumed that (being Corelle) they would be thin and lightweight. NO! I could have done without the thickness and space consumption.
2,Beware of Shipping,"I ordered these from amazon around christmas, I like the plates fine. The problem was that they were shipped with no padding or wrap so by the time I got them the only thing that survived was a plate and a couple of the bowls. This may have been a freak incident, but it happened none the less"
3,Dinner Plates Too Large For Our Dishwasher,"We tried to adjust the racks, no luck! Must wash by hand. They barely fit between the dowels in our cabinet's display area. Now I know why they were the cheapest of the sets! Probably discontinued."
1,Not Corelle Thin!,Actually...more like ZERO stars!!!Verrrrry unlike any Corelle dishes I have purchased in the past. These pieces are clunky and extremely HEAVY. I doubt if they fit properly in anyone's kitchen cabinets and definately provide a free workout...forget about joining a gym...these bricks would do the same job....useless as dishes and definately not Asian flair...more like a Dodge in Toyota clothing!
1,DONT BUY,My husband bought these for me last year..yup...i keept them in the box all this time until a week ago..i opened it and to my surprise there was a small plate missing...the dishes were damaged..chipped from the edges to be exact..and to my luck my husband threw out the box that i had sitting in the garage for a week! the blue is nice though.
5,Indigo Blue stoneware,"Great price,Love the color--Got delivery really fast,nothing broken.the dinner plate is a little heavy--but I still love the set--waiting for serving bowls,platters...etc...."
4,"Great Dishes, oddly sized.","Like many other people who bought these dishes online, i had one set arrive broken. Since the dishes come in a set, i had to ship them all back (even though only 2 bowls broke). I purchased from amazon directly, so the return was extremely easy. As far as size goes, again like many other reviewers, i found the dinner plates don't fit in my dishwasher and can't spin in my microwave. I do like the dishes though. They are heavy, sturdy, and attractive. If you are considering buying these dishes (and i assume you are if you're reading reviews), think about whether or not handwashing dinner plates will be an issue for you. Also, if you're ordering on a deadline, plan in time for at least one set to have broken items."
4,Corelle Hearthstone,"This set is very Classy/Elegant. They are not your typical Corelle wear though. Hence the Hearthstone, they are very heavy but I am glad I purchased them. I received two of the small square lunch plates broken in the box. Everything else was intact. I think they should wrap each individual plate in bubble wrap but that's my opinion. How many people received broken plates? I do hope they will be sending replacements for the two small plates."
3,Beautiful but.....,"So I let my husband pick out the dishes this round (wait he picked out the other set when he gave them to me for our first christmas together??) Anyways, he picked this set out and I wasn't all that thrilled with the dark red and black (to dark for my taste) so after I got over the color I went to put them away and noticed how incredibly heavy they are for dishes! I wouldn't get these if you have younger children. They didn't fit in our cupboards so now I have these HUGE plates on my counter!I read that they were very durable, while doing dishes the other day I was holding on to a bowl and dropped it a matter of inches and it broke clean in half. It dropped at thee most 6 inches! How durable is that?That same night my husband was putting them in the dishwasher and hit two of them together and took a big chunk out of a plate. This all happened in the matter of 3 days (getting them to them breaking).NOT IMPRESSED! Spend money on a different set! Not worth the price or the hassle."
4,Solid Set,"The set is very sturdy, and looks very nice. One piece had some chipped paint, and they sent a replacement right away. I would say your getting a quality product here."
4,Nice set but be sure about the color you choose,"I ordered the Stone color and it's a little darker than the picture. I don't hate it but it did make me wonder if I should have gotten the white. Other than that, it's a cool looking set. Very large pieces. The bowl is perfect for pasta and the mugs are nice and big for morning coffee. I have an old set of black matte dishes from Ikea that go well with this one for when I have more than four guests."
2,Awkward and Strange,"As others have mentioned, these are ultra heavy and large. The Indigo set is more of a royal purple, and has a lot of matte black on the outsides and undersides of plates and bowls. I ordered the ""modern square"" version, and the photos do not show how the plate edges are swooped and wavy. I can't get the 4 dinner plates to stack neatly. The rims of the mugs are thick and designed with a round interior stuck into a rectangular exterior, which makes for an awkward coffee drinking experience. Even for the bargain price ($48.95) and free Amazon Prime shipping, I can't live with these dishes. I would have given one star, but Amazon's customer service and fast shipping bumped it up to two."
2,received broken,"This is a nice set but one bowl and one plate was broken when I received it. This vendor also requires signatures for delivery, very annoying"
5,Corelle Plates,"The dishes are exactly as they appeared in the picture. Very nice, and VERY heavy! I got them for my brother, and he likes them a lot. He just wishes there were some that had silver and black on them. I'm just not sure why it costs an extra $30-$40 to have them delivered is all."
1,Never buy a used book again,"Two weeks before the FE exam, I find out that I am missing pages 183-230. Thanks a lot!"
1,"Great concept, great title, poor execution.",Very disappointing. The drills simply incorporate a variety of different shots in different sequences. There is nothing particularly unique about them. Very few illustrations. $12.55 is a lot of money for 52 pages of very limited usefulness
5,Best Book On Squash YouCan Buy!!,"The more drills you will do the MORE ""LUCKY"" you will be in the court. Best squash drill book available in the market. Don't miss it if you see it anywhere!!"
5,Young Ones ~ Cliff Richards & The Shadows,It was sheer joy listening to this nostalgic collection. A journey to my childhood days. Excellent collection!!
4,"Inspirational, Refreshing, ...","This book contains so many highly inspirational stories which reflects on the fact that Modern day societies no longer provide ample ""breathing"" space for ""socialising"". It shows how and where people really and truly like to interact and how ""knowledge"" is being shared (freely) without fear of any kind. From a business sense, if we can capitalise on some of these ""Third Places"", we might even established a profitable venture! Steven Lim (RSTN) - Singapore."
3,A little disappointed...,"Although I enjoyed reading 'first person"" pieces from owners/originators of 'great third places,' I was hoping for a greater range and variety. There were of course a lot of coffee shops, and overall most were very small businesses. Does that mean that a larger business can't create & sustain the third place idea? I don't think so, but this book celebrates small and personal, and for many places success rests in the hands of one or two special employees. That's not strategy, that's personality."
4,This price is outrageous!!,Just a word of caution the price here is out of control! We just bought this for our 2 yr old son at Target yesterday. It may be sold out at some Targets but most of them I called said it isnt that hot of a toy! Its still VERY easy to find in there stores. Anyways cool toy! Even our 7 yr gets a kick out of it! I recommend!
3,Too heavy and too loud!,"It's a cool toy. And my 3 year old really wanted it. Once he got it, he played for a few minutes, then said, ""turn that thing off!"" because it was so loud. He complains that it's too heavy to fly around as well. So now it just sits in our living room... a cute, big, red rocket."
2,Burned son's hand,I bought this toy yesterday at Target. I brought it home and put the batterries in and it did not work. My three-year-old was SO dissappointed. He did not care it did not turn on. He still wanted to yank it out of my hands and play with it. A few minutes later he was yelling at the top of his lungs saying it was burning him. The thing was so hot! I unscrewed it to find the brand new batterries melting. They were brand new! I called Mattel and they just asked ME to mail it in and wait 8 to 10 weeks for a replacement. They put it all on ME. I was livid! I am so tired of toys made in China.
2,NOT as advertised,"seller pics and descriptions showed product in complete box, with notes in the photos about how all 4 action figures are included. product came with just the rocket shell... no lid, no monitor, no figures, no box. total bait-and-switch. returned right away and received refund. We went to buy this because or son played with his cousin's our entire trip home for Christmas. After this experience, my brother was nice enough to ship his rocket to our son because his kids just don't play with it anymore. our son loves the toy itself. I wish it had a lower volume switch... the noises it makes are too loud for regular playtime. it like it's shouting at you."
3,Price versus quality versus popularity,"Considering the negatives, price and quality, they far exceed the popularity of the toy and my desire to buy it for my two year old granddaughter."
4,Daughter loves it,"$80 on Amazon! I bought this toy at Target last week for $35! For 35 it is a great toy, for 79 it would be severly overpriced. My 2 1/2 year has a bit of trouble opening the top, but that seems to be loosening up now (the latch sticks), once open, it does not like to stay open, but she's OK with that. She loves the Einsteins on TV, and now thinks it great she can play along with them."
4,LOVEIT!!,"This toy is amazing. My son loves the little einstein's and he now has the opportunity to act out his own ""missions"". It comes with all of the characters however they are in a fixed position / arms and legs are not posable. One word of caution...this toy is extreemely over priced. I found it at target for HALF what it is listed for here. Look around you have plenty of time before christmas and WILL find it cheaper at target."
4,Way too expensive!!!!,"I totally agree with the other reviewer! Way, Way, too expensive. It is just horrible that people buy out every toy that they think is going to be in big demand come Christmas and then try to sell it for 3 times as more money! Luckily I did get one and only paid about $30 for it. Only because I had a $25 gift certificate and I applied for the credit card to get an additional $30 off. At the time I bought mine, it was $80. Now I'm trying to get another one for my other son(because I know they're going to fight over it) and can't find it for under $110. Thats just CRAZY!!!!! I had the same problem last Christmas trying to get the mickey mouse clubhouse. I ended up getting it on e-bay for $150!!!! Now its in Wal-mart for $30!!! Never again. If the price doesn't come down or Target doesn't get it back in stock, I will wait until after Christmas when it's everywhere for ALOT cheaper. YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF FOR RIPPING OFF CHILDREN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Good toy for a 3 - 4 year old,"My son, 3.5 yrs old, loves this toy. He flies it around while watching the show. He has dropped it, tossed it, and generally plays hard and Rocket still works. The only annoying feature is the canopy. This hinge is just some tabs that easily pop out and we are constantly having to put the ""lid"" back on. On the upside it doesn't break!"
5,Excellent Toy and Figures,This is an excellent toy for any child that likes the Little Einstiens TV show. The figures are accurate and solid and interact with rocket...
4,Can't put it down.,Gave this as a birthday gift to a 3 year old. He has not stopped playing with it since the moment he opened it.
3,definitely not for little hands,"I have three children, ages 7yrs, 4 1/2 years and 2yrs. My youngest keeps removing the TV screen and cover off Rocket and running off with them. My other kids seem to have fun with making Rocket zig and zag, but our rooms never seem to be wide enough for the 20-pattern route we choose.... heck, we have a tough time with 5!It's cute, but not my favorite Christmas present, by far."
4,I LIKE IT,"My grand son really loves it and its now his favourite toy. Everyday he watches allways Little Einsteins and after he enjoys more playing with it, special the nave and all the little figures that represents his heroes."
3,"A Favorite Toy, But Not Durable","I bought this Little Einstein's Pat Pat rocket on April 11th. After about four weeks, the hatch/windshield piece has broken off. My child is not terribly hard on toys; we have had very few toys break (in fact he plays very carefully with older toys that I used as a child).Another complaint I have is that the figurines are pretty lame and they don't fit into the seats easily. I take issue with this because I think this toy is very expensive considering how little you get for the price.Rocket is very big- too big for little hands. The music is also quite loud.I do like that it teaches the words ""crescendo"" and ""diminuendo"". My child is a big Little Einstein's fan, so he loves having his own Pat Pat Rocket. I just wish that it had a higher play value."
4,Great toy for younger kids,I think this a great toy for 1 1/2 - 3 year olds. This top comes off easily and sometimes snaps shut so that would be my only concern about this toy's quality.
1,sickening....,I'm sitting here with my mouth hanging open...how dare a toy company price gauge like this??? Or is it Amazon? Over 300 dollars for a plastic toy are you kidding me??? My little girl wants this and I so badly want her to walk out Christmas morning to all of the things she asked for under the tree...and it's not that I couldn't afford it with my Christmas savings...I just cannot bring myself to do it..spend this sort of money!!!?? It's ludicrous!! Am I not the only one freaking out about this???
1,price rising...,Have been amused by the reviews of the cost of this toy. From it being $33 in 2008 to $300 to $400 and today it is offered at $700. Who would ever pay that much for something? Don't be an idiot.
4,Little Einsteins,"I could not believe the price for this toy. We found this toy about 2 years ago and it was 32.99 on sale after christmas at Target, and my son loves it, and we have to make him leave it at home sometimes because he wants to take it everywhere. My daughter also likes June from Little Einsteins and we bought her one also. I must say that I was surprised when I saw the price, I kept looking to see if it had something else that came with it, or maybe the price is just showing up incorrect."
4,RIPOFF,"Agree with other reviewers. SAME TOY CAN BE FOUND AT TARGET FOR UNDER $40.True, I got the last one on the shelf but... OVER $100????COME ON!!!!"
3,For class I took.,Ordered for a class and it was a good use for info and research on what was required for the teacher.
2,hmmmm,"The book focuses primarily on herbal treatments for children; it was an okay read, but not what I expected. I wouldn't keep it in my library."
4,Good Music,"Eartha Kitt, Weather Girls, Bronski Beat, Gloria Gaynor, Natalie Grant, The Dream Girls, and more. 17 tracks total."
2,Who Cares?,A suicidal girl. Overbites galore. Shattered selves. Imaginary friends and events. Family tumult. Art school. An anti hero. It was all a dream.
1,Slow movie with no real direction.,I think that the other posters on this board must be related to the cast of this dog. The plot is convoluted but not in a good way....in a way that makes you think that this movie is the edited result of a film abortion. The movie is pointless and uses its lack of clarity to try unsuccessfully to develop a depth that it just does not have. The premise is thin and in the end ridiculous. The acting is very English and you do not develop any character attachment. In the end there is just relief...nothing else.Please save your money.
2,Very Ambiguous... kinda frsutrating!,"I usually love movies that make me think, but this one drove me crazy. It was basically telling three different stories at the same time and it wasn't until 46 minutes into the movie that I had any clue as to what was happening.The three stories all come together at the end, but at that point, it was too late.I do think that this movie will appeal to some people. The acting is good and the London settings are interesting. It does try to make strong statements about religions, post war mental trauma and child abuse."
3,"So Close, So Promising","I was very excited by the previews for this film. It looked viscerally captivating, mysterious, and ominous. And half of it was. The movie follows two separate worlds, and I wish they simply left the one half dealing with our world out of it. The movie had great promise, and I am convinced that if they were to redo this movie, focusing only on the visually striking world, it would be a massive success.All in all, though, it's a good movie to watch. I would definitely watch it again, but I think I would just chapter skip to the parts which interested me."
2,Not my cup of tea,"This movie is a dark romance/tragedy. Four people come together in the end but it takes most of the movie to figure out what is going on. It left me with a feeling of 'Is this all there is... you must be kidding'. Overall, the acting is as good as the plot allows. This is not an action flick. Franklyn is not a super hero or a comic book villian. I guess it is not my kind of movie."
2,I didn't like it.,"The bizarre looking city with the guy in the mask is really only 1/5 of this movie. Most of it is set in our world and is about average people. I use that word ""about"" loosely. Of this one and a half hour movie about an hour of it is just people sitting or standing around looking sad. It focuses way to hard on trying to set a mood and not actually doing anything. You could remove half the film and no one would notice. I don't think I've been this bored in a long time."
3,A glass half-empty...,"The art direction and initial premise of ""Franklyn"" was certainly compelling enough to capture my attention as well as my imagination... typically, I love these kinds of movies. The acting and dialog carry the film well enough, but the scope of the production values is not enough to turn this narrowly focused Freudian psycho-drama into the epic it wants to be. I found it to be a small story told in the context of a needlessly large, and subsequently distracting, setting. Additionally, the characters weren't endearing enough to merit my sympathies or admiration. Franklyn himself ended up confusing me more than enlightening or inspiring so the ending rang hollow for me, I honestly couldn't muster enough caring to be left with any sense of wonder or loss.The movie ""V for Vendetta"" makes a good corollary as it takes all these elements and combines them effectively into an epic ride. If Franklyn had a message as large as it's ambitious effort it would have been far more satisfying."
4,four stars for visual.,"This was quite a visual treat, with the usual end of being about delusional people living in their own little fantasy world. Two of the stories, while leading the characters into the final confrontation, were distractions that added nothing to the film other than possibly an excuse for the writer and/or director to publicly air his family trials and disappointments (think 'Lost in space'). 'Meanwhile city' would have been a marvelous film in my opinion, but I am probably too shallow to allow myself to spiral down into the raw human emotions that were the underpinnings of everything else in this film except 'Meanwhile city'."
3,Still waiting,"I am still waiting for full seasons. This is the only way I buy my favorite TV shows. This is one of my top ten favorites, and I want to purchase it but won't unless it is a full season, not split, original music, and presented as was originally shown b/w."
2,Not as advertised,"They say it is in color and it is not, for the price of 1/2 of the year of this show , I would think it had to be in color! Way over priced for 18 shows and it is in Black and White"
2,GOOD ALTERNATIVE..MAYBE,"well of course the sitcom MY THREE SONS is a good alternative to todays garbage. however, if this is going to be another volume of edited and altered nonsense then no thank you. after all the complaints of the season one debacle, CBS/Paramount didnt even consider correcting it. the season one dvd's were atrocious with editing and new music. it will be really exciting to see what the fine folks at cbs/paramount have in store for us this time. maybe colorizing the b&w second season? maybe giving us rinky-dink piano music as though we were watching a silent movie this time? how about robin williams as the voice of bub? oh theres no end to what those masterminds at CBS can come up with to teach us a lesson about spending our hard-earned money......."
1,More like an MTV than a documentary,"It does feature stars but one does not get an insightful explanation of how they truly rose in the field of basketball. If you're looking for an MTV special using spectacular basketball video clips mostly dunk shots of high school kids (now famous) of a decade ago, this is the right thing. I was looking for a documentary to show what their formula to success was and it isn't."
4,Addicting? You bet,"Im addicted to this disc. Im a veterinarian, and everyday that Im in surgery, I put this baby in and sing along. Kansas has to be the best song on the disc. I find myself waking up singing this song. You can't go wrong with it. If you're a Bunnymen fan, you'll love it."
4,Ian does it again!,"It's hard to think of any artist who is as consistant as Ian McCulloch. Since the reunion of Echo & the Bunnymen in 1997, Ian has released nothing but quality material and Slideling is no exeption. Let's face it, there is NO difference between the later Echo material and ""Slideling"". It's easy to understand how bands like ""Coldplay"" and ""Travis"" are influenced by Mr.McCulloch. All 11 songs are gems with ""Love in veins"" being the standout. I would go as far as saying that it's my favorite song of the year, thus far. All songs are in the mid-tempo mode. Ian has never sounded more confident in his songwritting and the melodies never stop coming.A must have for ""Echo"" fans or for the curious. Enjoy!"
5,SAME AS THE OTHER ONE,"but remastered with Sony's 24 bit digital system.Go for the cheapest one,the sound is more than OK on the original,and I hate cardboard slips other than those wrapping a plastic jewel case-the disc is inside the slip in this case."
4,Best of Raw?,"Okay first off, I don't think this was the BEST or Raw... The way I see it this seemed to be the best of Stone Cold Vs. Vince.... Maybe I just wanted more out of it, but... Oh well. Now on to the good part. The DVD version has tons and I mean TONS of extras. The extras realy boost the value of this. So to put it in simple terms... With out the extras I would rate it 3 stars... with the extras I give it 4. Buy it..."
4,Awesome DVD,So many Extras it CRazy definately buy this !! Don't get the Videos!! You wanna get this DVD SET!!
1,Stupid logos ruin this DVD!,"I bought this DVD because I am a fan of silent era films and especially people like Melies and Winsor McCay. Sadly though, this DVD is utterly ruined. Someone thought it was a good idea to super-impose a gawd-awful white logo in the lower left hand side of the film, creating a distraction and a nuisance. I recommend against buying this DVD because it will encourage others to pull this nonsense. Would you like to see a beautiful restoration of Star Wars with a nasty Lucasfilms logo on top of it??? Didn't think so."
5,Very nice.,"The films on this set are well restored, and look very good. They are presented as if we are in the audience watching a festival, which can be a bit annoying, but overall, the films are well shown.The cropping, as mentioned before, is a pain. There are better editions of some of these films out there.The documentary is a puzzler. It is REALLY well done, and covers a lot of ground. It leaves nothing out. And perhaps that is why I can't get though it without falling asleep. It's interesting, it's fascinating, it's well done, and it's a sleep aid for me. Odd."
4,Grnade Pablo,"Sin duda que Pablo es uno de los mejores exponentes de la trova cubana, sus canciones son increibles, pero en este CD, cuando hace duo con Victor mauel, este ultimo opaca la grandiosa voz de Pablo por lo que algunas canciones se distorsionan de las originales cantadas solo por Pablo, que si lo has escuchado en concierto, es simplemente increible"
3,Son increible por separado,Pablo es fantastico pero en este CD su voz se ve apagada al lado de Victor Manuel. Me parecio tambien que el arreglo musical es un poco lejano al original de las canciones.
5,Uprooting Anger,This is an excellent book on dealing with anger and what the scriptures have to say about it. I shared this with one trained in clinical counselling and was told it was the best book available on this topic.
1,My Fiction Writing Career by Erika Holzer,"If this book were edited to cover the material that the title promises, it would be twenty pages long, five pages if condensed into a tight read. This book is about Mrs. Holzer, with a few references about Rand. I could care less if she got to hug a movie star, where she lives, etc. Her ""Imagined conversation with Ayn Rand,"" is outragious. I assume that this was thrown in the book to bring up the page count. In fact, I think a lot was thrown in to get the page count up to ""book length."""
4,field work pays off,"Richmond's book reminds us how valuable it is to have someone do the hard work of going into the field and talking to the real people involved. Alas, too few social scientists and policy analysts do this sort of thing. There are many insights that the official statistics cannot provide. This is why Richmond's work is so important. There are often subtle points of organization and political style that matter a lot. Richmond has done a fine job of discovering these and reporting them in a readable format."
3,Decent book on black women lawyers,"Smith is a black male law professor at Howard University. He selects documents which discuss black women in the law from the time that the first sister was sworn in to the present. This book has great statistical facts and is a good tool for arguing why affirmative action is necessary in law schools. However, I would have preferred if a historian had written this book. As it stands, this is just a scrapbook that included selected writings on the topic. There is much academic literature on women in the law and blacks in the law and it is not incorporated well into this book. In addition, there are a number of incredible black, female law professors out there and their work on black women's legal issues barely gets addressed here. In brief, this book is a nice piece to have, but it could have been better."
5,"Helpful, practical...for everyone","This type of book should be a must read for every business person, church member or parent. It has helped me all the above places of my life. Not only does this book address common areas of communication, but it helps explain why I make mistakes in my speech patterns. I especially found it helpful to minimize placing people on the defensive and getting into disagreements...even with my teenagers :)I look forward to reading Dr. Sedler's other book Stop the Runaway Conversation that deal with gossip and criticism.Keep them coming...this is a real A+"
1,BORING!,"I had the impression the images and the process were unique and creative. In fact, the transferred photos are very very ordinary.In contrast, I also got China Blossoms notecards by Asian Art Museum of San Francisco. They are incredible! Imagine the best of the impressionists painting blossoms oriental-style. The photos available at Amazon do not do justice to the quality of the artwork."
5,great product,"My beagle-terrier mix Dexter had been having some issues with his hip and lower spine (He is 10). He had to be on steroids and pain medicine and I knew that it was probably time to put him on a good supplement. My lab who is 9 has also been moving more slowly. I have been using this product now for about a month and both are so much more energetic! I give this to my beagle too and she licks the bowl clean (well, she does that anyways :) but I also notice a little more ""spring in her step."" Dexter is now completely off the pain medicines and his vet said today at his checkup that it doesn't seem like he will be needing arthritis medicine, for a long time, if at all! Some reviewers said it has a bad smell, and although very strong molasses smelling, it doesn't seem to smell bad. Besides, most dogs tend to go for smelly things anyways :)"
4,repeat buyer but not as good?,"I have purchased this product several times before with good results in my Great Danes. Decent shipping time but this time I did get the product and it had clumps of hard stuff in it. Since this product is ""moist"" granulars I figured it was still ok to use. I didnt find the clumps until I was towards the bottom of the product of would have conatacted them. Will buy from again though and notify them if it presists."
4,"Mice,men,charms and dreams","John Steinbeck's novel is really charming. I liked very much his ways of presenting places and his wonderful characters, such as Lennie,""He's dumb as hell, but he ain't crazy"" and George. These two guys, who take so much care for one another, are friends who share a dream,""We'll have a big vegetable patch and rabbit hutch and chickens"" and as they got ""no family"" they are travelling to a ranch where they will work, so as to make their dream come true. Here they meet many other guys, loonely guys who go through strong feelings like discrimination, violence and agressivness. It is the niciest story I have ever read as friendship is the most exprssed feeling."
4,Gemma and Michael,"Hi!, we are really enjoying this book, Michael really likes Curleys wife. It is a really emotional book! I think the character descriptions are really good and I feel really sorry for Lennie because he doesn't understand the feelings and emotions of others. He also doesn't know his own strengt"
3,It is about Mice and Men,"It was an excellent vook. You will love it, too. John Steinbeck is a very good writer who created the setting of the story in my head."
1,review--of mice and men,I thought this book was terrible. The author is incompitant. This book is about every normal farm hand in the time of the great derpression. It honestly is the worst book i've ever read.
5,I loved it!,It was a great book. The reader begins to love Lenny despite his dangerous instincts. It shows that even those who seem to be cold-hearted have compassion. George was good to Lenny when he didn't have to be.
5,I think the book is great,I think OF MICE AND MEN was a really great story and I recomend it to any one who loves a story that will keep you in suspense on what is going to happen next. I read this story in school and I could not wait till I went to my class to read it.
4,almost great piece of work,"I enjoyed this book from start to...almost... finish. The way Steinbeck ended his story was the worst anticlimax I have ever read. To be frank, the ending, shall I say, sucked.But to move on to the positive things, the dialogue was well-written, and the characters were solid and believable. It feels as if they were real people. Despite what I said about the ending, I still reccommend this book."
4,"Mice,men,charms and dreams","John Steinbeck's novel is really charming.

Here they meet many other guys, loonely guys who go through strong feelings like discrimination, violence and agressivness. It is the niciest story I have ever read as friendship is the most exprssed feeling."
1,You call this a book?,this book is more like a P.O.S.....i cant believe you got this published Steinbeck. If you could write a book..I can write a book. This is one of the worst book i ever read. i think the irony you have in the book is on accident. You are too dumb to have thought it out that well. I think that your mama wrote it.. and you copied.
2,"Needed a plot, but a book to read.","The book was too short and should have had more of a plot. Too many animals and people died. It was a slow moving book and when it was over, it seemed as if it should of still had 100 more pages to go., it ended very fast. George should have shot or ditched lennie in the begging of the book."
1,I felt that the story had really no plot and a bad ending.,"I feel that Lennie really has no clue throughout this whole story. As for George, he is not all that bad, but I feel sorry that he has to spend so much time with that retard Lennie."
5,Kirk gets the babe----AGAIN!,"In ""Elaan"" we get our first look at the dreaded Klingon D-7 battle cruiser...complete with disruptor fire! It's so cool it's frozen! In ""Paradise"".....a ""Star Trek"" version of ""Pocohontas""...maybe it should have been called ""Trekohontas"" : ) Seriously now, ""The Paradise Syndrome"" contains the best music in the 3rd season."
5,A Cry of Joy!,"I first found this book about 30 years ago in the lending library of a mobil home park where I was living while my husband attended Arizona State University. I loved it so much, and often found myself reading pages aloud to him because I had to share them with someone! Later, I was sorry that I was honorable enough to return the book when I finished it, because for many years I have told people about it and searched to find it again. Lo and behold! Several years ago, I found a copy in the lending library of the condo development where I now live - in NY. I've waited until just recently to reread the book, though, fearing that after 30 years I would find it much less wonderful than I remembered. I was thrilled to find out that it is even more wonderful than I remembered, and I not only look forward to reading it over and over, but to sharing it with family and friends! Definitely one of my all-time favorites."
5,A Great Book,"Jeff Fields and I graduated high school as classmates in 1956. His humor and writing abilities were prevalent even back then. I saw Jeff at our 50 year class reunion in 2006 and he hasn't changed one bit. I am not surprised A Cry Of Angels receives such high literary recognition. Being from the same home town, Elberton, Georgia, I can see the resemblance in many of his characters and the people we grew up knowing. I think this book is a must-read for anyone over 12 years old. If you haven't read A Cry Of Angels do yourself a big favor and order it today. You will be enriched with this masterpiece of an outstanding writer, Jeff Fields."
5,Capturing the essence of the Arabian,"""Arabians"" From the Camera of Johnny Johnston is a beautifully arranged pictorial of the Arabian horse. Guests to my home can't help but pick it up and look through it. Everyone leaves with a greater respect for the beauty of the Arabian Horse. Thanks so much for publishing not only a book, but a treasure."
2,Disappointing,"Johnny Johnston is an amazing photographer. I purchased the book expecting to see more quality for the price of $45.00. Don't get me wrong, the photos in the book are beautiful.. Especially, the cover of *Padron and back flap of *Bask. However, I know JJ has thousands of more interesting and beautiful photographs from his collection. I do not think there is enough value in the price."
1,Waste of Money,"We bought this at suggestion of our dentist. However, it is difficult to use, extremely messy and the on/off button on handle is difficult to press. We used it a couple of times but have not used it since because of messiness and inconvenience.Our neighbors bought the same model, tried to use it a few times and have not tried to use it since for the same reasons we gave.Save your money and go back to flossing!!"
4,Serious cleaning power.,"My dentist warned me that if I didn't start using a WaterPik, especially around my bridges and crowns, I was going to have trouble. Brushing just wasn't effective enough between teeth and around the base of the crowns. I didn't listen and paid the price - money and discomfort from a root canal plus a lot of ""I told you so""s from him and my wife.Not wanting to help my dentist pay for yet another Lexus, I caved and bought the WaterPik. I have to admit that it is really effective. A little messy and noisy but it sure does get stuff out that brushing couldn't remove. Has more power than I can use. Seems to make my gums feel better also.Wish I didn't have to use it, but wish more that I would have started long ago.The only reason I'm downgrading it to 4 stars is because the handle leaks a little and the whole device seem just a wee bit cheesy. Wish I there was a lid for the reservoir so I wouldn't have to leave it open or take it apart after use."
1,"At $10, it'd still be a waste of money","It's very noisy. Once unpacked, you will NEVER get the cord stored again ... which also means you have to leave the reservoir laying on your sink. Leaks develop after several months. Dies within a year. I'm assuming this is true for all models made by the company, so I'd advise trying any of the other brands.NEW ""Ultra"" ... a world of difference. Quieter. Cord stores easily. More powerful. Just out of the box, it's 4 Stars."
4,Lovin the jet,"While most of the reviews that I read on this product were somewhat negative, my experience with the Waterpik has always been positive. While the hose broke on my previous model, it was over ten years old and I think someone mishandled it while cleaning the bathroom. This new unit is much quieter than my previous one and it seems more powerful also. I couldn't be more pleased."
2,"Not Great, But Not Bad (but Unrepairable)","This was a great device for several years. It's loud, but it gets my teeth clean. After 8 years of intermittent use, the seals in the handle blew and it leaked hideously. Water Pik is apparently aware of the problem and has a replacement handle kit for about $9 plus S&H.; If the motor holds out for another 5 years, I'll be very happy. If I start using it daily, my dentist will be happy.Update 07APR11: I've knocked off a star since the repair kit only lasted 3 months. The new hose coupling piece would not stay put in the old hose section as this area was brittle and cracking plastic. The entire old hose needs to be replaced since you can't make it flexible enough to seal around the coupling link. I ended up tossing the whole unit and buying a new (more quiet) model."
5,Waterpik used for Nasal Irrigation,"This was recommended by my E.N.T. doctor because I get frequent sinus infections. I ordered a special attachment for it. It works great for my sinuses. I also like using it for its intended purpose, a dental instrument."
4,Great Tool,This is my 3rd WaterPick. I really like that it gives a stong stream of water to loosen food from inbetween my back teeth. Wish there was a way to quiet the sound as it is used but how it works is still more important. I recommend treating you gums with care by getting one yourself.
3,"Home solution, good choice","The last month purchase this product for my neighbor. She is very happy, medical billing is lot amount. But this product reduce medical cost.Good choice"
3,waterpik dental water jet,Over all the Water pik is an average product. The product should have a regulator to slow down/speeed up the jet of water. A high speed jet will detachb the gum from the teeth causing the root to be exposed to attack by bacteris thus causing decay of the tooth. Else the waterpik works flawlessly
4,Good overall,"Overall, good performing water-floss system. A bit shaky and noisy, though and occaisionally ""balks"" at startup."
5,Waterpik WP-70,I purchased this Waterpik to replace my old waterpik which was working but I could no longer get replacement tips for. All I can say is that if you need a dental irrigator don't waste your time and money on any other brand. Waterpik brand is the best!!! You won't be disappointed.
2,Bad design,I understand what they were trying to accomplish with the water control being located on the handle. The issue with this is the strength of the jet can be accidentally adjusted and if someone has sensitive gums/teeth that could be extremely uncomfortable. I personally would rather have the setting control on the base where it can't be accidentally moved.
3,Inconsistent quality,"I had my first WaterPik for over three years and it worked great. Finally, the hose started leaking, but I didn't mind replacing it.Well, I just got my new WaterPik (same model) and it isn't nearly as powerful. I don't know if they changed it or if I got a defective one. The first one was really noisy, but it did a great job."
3,awkward and noisy!,"Waterpik WP-70/WP-70W Family Dental Water JetThis is my first attempt at any type of water irrigation device, but I'm not thrilled. Its noisy, certainly couldn't use it if someone was asleep in the house. Its messy, shoots water everywhere, I am hoping that with experience will come finesse!It does what it is designed to do, but you have to be very careful about the setting, it can be strong enough to make tender gums bleed a bit. This is my first impression with it, I'll add more if I change my mind."
2,"5 stars for cleaning, 1 star for durability","I too loved the way this cleans, but also found that mine broke after about 6 months (the curly hose detached from the handheld unit). Add that to the fact that it is loud as heck, and I don't understand how this retails for $40+."
1,free but mediocre,"This product was sent to me by WaterPik after two of the battery powered hand-held items failed (first one the motor, second one the battery). They are quick to send out a replacement unit if you just call them. It seems they know they make such a poorly made and designed product. This unit is very hard to control, to keep from getting water all over the place. The tip comes out easily if you press the wrong direction on the knob. The ""pause"" button is hard to keep down, so more water all over. A very crude product - if they hadn't sent it to me for free, I would return it to the store. I will continue to look for a better product as my dental hygenist says my teeth and gums are so much better after using this kind of device."
5,head of household,Well made. big improvement of the older model. Spray is powerful and gets in places I have been too yet.But I am impressed with this unit. I replaced a five year old of the same model and this one is showing where Waterpick has made improvements in it.
2,WaterPik WP-70 review,"We had used a WaterPik for many years and just wore it out. We bought the new version of WP-70/WP-70-W and have been very unhappy with the oeration of this unit.Apparently,over the years, WaterPik has redesigned their units to give a ""pulsating"" flow of water. Our old unit performed the cleaning with a ""volume"" of water, thus flushing out anything between thec teth. The new pulsating action is very poor. If you turn up the pressure to get more volume, the water jet is very hard on the gums.I wish we were back with our old unit and not this supposed newer technology."
2,Wrong Model if you want to keep it for years,"I've owned this model Waterpik for one year now and it just died the same way the previous Waterpik died: the hose became brittle and broke. Unfortunately, you cannot change the hose to the hand unit on this device, you have to throw the whole thing away. I suggest spending an extra $12 and getting the Ultra version so that you can change hand-unit hoses when they break after a year. Otherwise, the unit works okay."
5,for the wife,These movies always bring a smile to my wife's face. She loves them! Recommended for any husband who needs a gift idea.
3,"Item is Fine, Dimensions are listed WRONG!!!","The item was fine but the dimensions listed were WRONG. The Item is actually smaller than listed. Thus, it did not fit. The length was too short. You should verify the dimensions with the manufacturer (Curt Manufacturing) before you purchase this item."
5,Nice hitch - solid value,"Product shipped on time, arrived in new condition. Added a ball and was able to pull camper. Kept my small car level with camper. Simple enough, good value."
1,I was rip off buy curt.,I purchase a trailer hitch from Curt for my 2000 Dodge Dakota. They sent me a hitch that fit a Toyota Sianna. I sent it back and never got Credit for it. They stole my money and the return shipping charge for the trailer hitch.
5,Loved this one,"I love the writings of the late Barbara Grizzuti Harrison, especially her ""Accidental Autobiography.""Question: Does anyone know who the man she refers to as ""Jazzman"" actually was?I have been trying to find out for years.Did she or her loved ones ever make this information known? Or did they want it kept confidential?"
2,Hard on the eyes...,Buyers should be aware that this is a smudgy reprint of a nearly century old text. The content is sound but the Arabic text is very hard to read.
3,Thanksgiving Hymns,"RE: ""Thanksgiving of American Folk Hymns"" - This CD did NOT contain hymns that I consider as ""Thanksgiving Hymns"". The music & vocals were nice, just NOT what I wanted when I ordered it. I was looking for familian, to me, hymns, such as ""We Gather Together"" & ""Let All Things Now Living"" & ""Come Ye Thankful People, Come"". Are there such hymns on a CD & available to order?"
4,good tank,Good tank and saves a lot of room in the dingy... A little pricey though for just being molded plastic..
1,Definitely not ready for prime time.,"With one exception, it would be easy to believe that none of these people had ever been on stage before. Act after act is painfully slow, pointless, and boring. Some of them spend more time explaining who they are and what they are going to do than actually doing it. You will have it beaten into your head that comedy is not easy.The DVD is a worse disaster than the CDs. Amateur night behind the camera as well as in front. One word for the people involved: EDITING! It goes a long way toward making things bearable!The one exception I mentioned above is Mike Birbiglia. He is head and shoulders above all the others put together. Go find his solo stuff and ignore these discs of torture."
3,bagels,"Everyone has pretty much summed up this disc: don't expect it to be a laugh a minute comedy riot. ""Invite Them Up"" (the weekly NYC comedy show) was supposed to be a sort of testing ground for new/weird material. And these CDs present the experience warts and all.Also:DAMN YOU DAVID WAIN!!! You have ruined bagels for me forever. Damn it!"
3,Tickles your funny bone,"From Smother Magazine smother.net-This mega-collection of comedy is (count `em) three audio CDs and one big DVD. New York's East Village is the headquarters to ""Invite Them Up"". ""Invite Them Up"" is a great weekly comedy show with standup, characters, music, short films, and odds and ends. Hosts Eugene Mirman, Bobby Tisdale, and Holly Schlesinger collect some of the best moments for this collection. Performers include God's Pottery, Todd Barry, David Cross, Jon Benjamin, The Doilies, Demetri Martin, and many more. On the DVD are Eugene's videos and performances by The Forgetabuddies, Amy Miles, Demetri Martin, David Cross and Jon Benjamin, Heather Lawless, Langhorne Slim, and many more. While not every comedian is hilarious, the majority are pretty funny. The audio CDs just make you feel like you're right there too. Check it out!"
5,Wide ranging and always intriguing,"Z magazine brings together some of the best journalism and opinion writing on a diverse array of pertinent global and local political matters (certainly political in the broad sense)Probably the best resource for perspectives from the so-called ""left"" and news of world events that can be very hard to find elsewhere. For a more editorial type magazine, see The Progressive, which is more a mainstream style of monthly magazine, but still offers a great degree of clarity on important issues."
2,5 stars for righties...2 stars for lefties,"This is a great product if you're right handed. But, my little south paw was a bit disappointed. It states in the description that it is for right and left handers, but it is really made for right handed pitchers. For lefties there is a note, ""As all instructional steps for left-handers are a mirror image of those shown for right-handers, left handers may wish to study these illustrations in this booklet in a mirror."" So when my son is outdoors trying to make use of this ball, he should carry a mirror in his pocket? Really? As for the baseball itself, the fast ball fingerprints are interchangeable, but the curveball and slider are not. Disappointing."
4,Pitching Ball,"This arrived very quickly and in perfect condition. It is necessary to read the instructions that come with the ball before knowing how to use it properly. Hang onto the instructions!Only 4 stars because it isn't always clear which fingers to place on the colors. Sometimes knowing where to place the thumb is confusing.Overall, neat idea for a product."
4,gift,"I think this is a great item, but my Grandson hasn't plated with it long enough for me to say more."
5,This is mexico's edith piaf!!!!!,"I came across Lola Beltran on a Reader's Digest Mexican Music CD set. The moment I heard her voice I knew this was indeed one of those rare once-in-a-lifetime singers. Hard emotional singing....she reminds me of Edith Piaf...not in style, but depths of emotion. You need not understand spanish to have lola bltran's voice penetrate your heart."
1,Wrong Product Sent,"I specifically ordered Ateco Meringue Powder from this site. When the package arrived, it was Americolor brand. I did not want Americolor and don't appreciate a product brand being substituted without my approval. Was very displeased and will contact seller... however, am left in a bind now."
1,Price too high,I think the price on this is outrageous. I get meringue powder locally: 1# 9oz for $4. This is highway robbery. I just wanted to let everyone know that you should look around and compare as you may be able to find a more reasonable price near you. Check bulk food stores first.
3,Crepe pans.,They work well but after using them for the first time I noticed that the finish was coming off the bottoms. Don't think that will affect the cooking ability but I was none the less surprised.
5,Creeps delight,Everyone kept telling me I could make beautiful crepes if I had the right pan.....and right they were. This little pan is wonderful and every crepe turns out beautiful. It's non stick surface makes turning a breeze and all you have to do for clean-up is wipe it out with a paper towel. Wish I had gotten this years ago.
5,Great Crepe pan!,"This really works but you need to go on line and read HOW TO MAKE CREPES with this very lovely, usefull, crepe pan, so you do not ruin the pan or the crepes! I'm very happy with this and was amazed by the price too! Great pan! Excellent on all levels!"
4,"Handle is wobbly, but the pan is good","It's easy to make crepes in this pan: the sides are sufficiently low, and the non-stick coating hasn't let me down. However, the construction is average; the handle started wobbling after I used the pan for the first time. It's not a deal-breaker, but it could be much better."
1,I do not know if it works...it broke first,"I can not really give a unbiased rating due to the fact that it broke in less than two minutes after I took it out of the package. Flexible is not really a word that should be placed on this product, because you have to be a weightlifter in order to bend it. I also bought another company's extension so I would not have to wait another week to get it and it was just as hard, but it didn't crumble."
5,Jhet is an Inspiration...Dreams Can Come True!,"Jhet Torcelino-van Ruyven is an amazing woman and a powerful storyteller. In 'The Tale of Juliet: You Have the Power to Change Your Life,' she recounts the numerous challenges she's overcome in her life and all that she's learned to take her from poverty to prosperity. Her inspirational story will move you and make you look at your life with new eyes of opportunity. This special book will help you reframe negative experiences and ignite your passion to seize opportunities to make a difference in the world. Jhet's life affirms that dreams truly can come true!Sheri FinkAuthor, 'The Little Rose'"
5,Inspirational & Moving Life Story,"It's not often that i read a book from cover to cover in a single sitting. The Tale of Juliet had me hooked from the start, and didn't let up over the course of a truly amazing, roller coaster life.The book is inspirational due to the magnitude of the obstacles that Jhet overcame, not once but several times on her journey. These were the kind of obstacles that anyone with an internet connection are never likely to encounter ... and so they serve as a truly powerful example of what is really possible in life.Read this book for no other reason than to remove the limitations you have placed on your own life - I guarantee your dreams will get bigger, and seem more attainable after reading The Tale Of Juliet.The simple telling of her story is both a refreshing break from the usual ""How I became a millionaire"" books, and a moving personal account.Big dreams really do come true!"
1,I never received Step Stone & I tried numerous times to contact you.,I never got to hear this CD because I never received it. It was shipped on December 5th and wound up at some warehouse in California. Never to arrive at my address. Can you help me receive my item that I bought and paid for!!!! I tried going on where's my stuff and that didnot work either. Please tell me how I can receive this CD I purchased as my husband's christmas present. Needless to say I had nothing to give him because I never received it. My sister orders from you all the time. She said she has never had this problem. Can anyone help me?
5,Flowers in October,A great listening tape while doing work around thehouse or at the gym or out for a walk. I can't sayenough about Tim Janis' selection of musical pieces.
4,music,"I enjoy all the Tim Janis music. I consider it classical, not new age, but the genre is must less impartant than the sound."
5,What wonderful music!,"I happened to luck out and hear Tim Janis live one day and bought ""Shores of Acadia"" as a result. That was so good, I bought all of his other CDs. ""Flowers in October"" is the best in my opinion. I've found the first time or two I listen to a Tim Janis CD, it sounds good, but the more I listen, the better the music sounds. It really grows on me. The lush, inspiring sound really stirs the soul and is a great stress reducer. I would rank this the best CD I've ever heard. Try it and you'll know."
2,long and boring with flashes of once brilliance,I waited a long time for these guys to release a new album and it wasn't worth the wait. It lags on and on and never fully uses the rich vocals of Jean-luc. I wanted this album to be alive and pumping like they are live and with their previous work. It's ok to change and evolve but not at the expense of your fans and the very reason you liked them in the first place.Maybe a couple more listens will sway me but i doubt it.
3,"Agreed, should have been M or F Release","I agree this sounds like, and should have been, a Male or Female (F242 side-project) album...not a Front 242 album!This album does nothing to progress past M or F...what a waste of JL DeM! And there is no R23 on the album either...I suspect he thinks the album is not really a F242 project.Too bad...I have been a huge fan of F242 since 1986...I just expected more!Come on guys...get us a proper F242 album soon!!PS - I think the EP (Still and Raw) was 200% better"
3,Should Have been a Male or Female album,"I'm a huge fan of Front 242 but Pulse just sounds like the Male or Female side project with Jean-Luc DeMeyer on vocals. This is an amazing & complex but most of the time unfocused piece of work that shouldnt have been released as a Front 242 album. If you like this cd go out and buy the Male or Female album ""Invented Scenes/Naked"" its a much better album."
3,product of 10 years of silence,"It's not as bad as I expected it to be. At least Front 242 didn't roll down to what Apoptygma Berzerk rolled down, ""cheesy-ebm"". Listening to Front's live recordings like Re:Boot, I was totally upset with colorless versions of their great old songs. PULSE is not an example of such a bad taste though, I even found myself able to listen to it thrice or so."
1,Incredibly boring,"This is one of the most boring albums ever released. It's not that it doesn't sound a thing like any of their previous albums (it doesn't). That would fine if this were a good cd but it's terrible. It's so boring, ugly, long, tedious... It's not going to make them any new fans and will probably drive away a lot of the old ones. Sad."
2,NOT so good!,"First off, I love the old sounds of Front 242. The problem with the new stuff is the basses need to be fatter, the drums louder and eq the vocals. They use the nord lead2 on alot if not all of the tracks but it seems like they forgot to add some boost to it. With todays music everything is loud so my advice to Front 242 is to get with the program like the rest of the artist now days."
5,Different but Excellent...definitely 242,"The style for this is a bit different from other Front 242 offerings. It's a bit more mellow in some areas...and focuses more on beats and atmosphere. In any case, I really enjoyed it and I'm glad to *finally* have more new material from them and look forward to even more."
1,Dying Cow.,"I'm not sure but it seems the lead vocalist sounds more and more like a dying cow as the years go by. The songs are just boring. It's a huge step backwards from their previous work. If they tour and anything from this CD is to be performed, I won't be there. I'll stick with listening to Up Evil and anything earlier and their live performance CDs."
2,Romantic Up-tempo song,"Even though he is from Holland he sounds like a real Latinlover. This song is made for a romantic evening with candlelightdinner(just like the preview single ""I'd love you to want me""). If you like Ricky Martin or Enrique Iglesias this is something for you. But if not you'll probably start screaming by hearing such a schmalzy song.The single includes Radio, extended and Instrumental version."
3,I Love the 80's!,"Remember these? They were the highlight of one of the 80's most subversive shows, HBO's ""Not Necessarily the News"". THey're words that should be around, but aren't.Some are mortifying stupid. I think all the Aqua Net used to make that big 80's hair seeped into people's brains. I like some of them, and they were enough to justify my buying the book, so there you go."
5,M F K Fisher,You do not need a purpose to read Fisher. Her prose is great good fun in itself. I enjoy her clean simple prose with a sly bit of wit mixed in.I would suggest another of her books Long Ago in France. a great memoir.
5,I LOVE this sleeper,"I have to disagree a about the star that velcros over the zipper. I used this sleeper from 3 months until my twins outgrew them at 6 months. My girls never had a problem with the stars when they were younger and after about five months old, they would hold the stars and gum on them after they woke up. Mine had to work with their hands to get them into their mouths. They would actually entertain themselves for about 10 minutes in the morning which was a huge plus.I LOVE the fabric! It is a thick, yummy soft fabric that has not pilled after several washings."
4,Fun Viewing,Good chick-flick TV. Fun to watch and easy to get hooked on. This is girl night TV at its best.
4,Great followup to season 1,"If you enjoyed the first season you'll enjoy the second. The day to day lives of the brave men an women continue, as it is worth te watch."
4,Army Wives: The complete second season,A very good series. We just started watching the program this year and getting the past seasons have been great!!
4,Beautifully crafted show...,I loved this show. I couldn't wait for it to arrive after watching the first season - the second season was even more enjoyable. The cast are amazing actors and the writers and producers just brilliant. The way all the characters are developed through this season is beautiful to watch - I can't wait for the next season.
2,not in good shape,I bought this dvds and the seller said they where in good shape but they where all scratched and I tried contacting the seller and he never got back to me....
1,Defective Unit,"It would be a great unit if it worked, and it does in Celsius. Set to Fahrenheit, the difference (from a reference temperature) is off by 32 degrees. Since F = (9/5)*C + 32, it looks like either the firmware or a memory location is defective. I e-mailed ATD, and they e-mailed their Chinese supplier. They say the units are OK, so it looks like a Quality Assurance failure. I offered to send the unit to them, but they suggested I return it to the people who sold it to me.I'm returning the unit for replacement. If the new unit works, my review will improve._____________________Got a replacement unit, same problem. Celsius works perfectly, but in Fahrenheit the unit thinks the difference between 70 degrees and 70 degrees is 32 degrees.If ATD did quality assurance and fixed a few lines of embedded code, the unit would be first rate."
3,Stylish- Lightweight,"Expected a heavier product but very nice watch. If you pefer a lightweight watch and like the style, Buy. If not look elsewhere."
3,pretty good,as far as michael jackson goes this is a pretty good cd set. it covers his career with the jackson 5 and his solo career. all the songs i like from michael jackson are on this set so i'm happy with it.
3,Over saturation,"This album is a cruel trick in it's title. This is NOT an essential album to add to your Michael Jackson collection. While this one does fill in most of the gaps the other greatest hits collections have missed (especially ""Human Nature""), people who already have his albums or one of his other three greatest hits compilations (""Number Ones"", ""Ultimate"", or ""HIStory"") will find this disc redundant. Do yourself a favor: If you are starting a MJ collection, begin it by getting ""Off the Wall"" and ""Thriller"", easily his two best albums. After those two, then pick up ""Bad"" and then this one up to fill in the gaps of the other albums he has released."
4,Michael Jackson CD,"Great cd, I didn't know it was going to be a paper case, I would have preferred the hard plastic case, but a great product and great service. Shipped quickly and in good condition."
5,The Essential 3.0 Michael Jackson (Eco-Friendly Packaging),"I loved that this included songs that were not on other collections, songs with brothers and duets with Paul McCartney. The songs brought back great memories.The only concern I had was the packaging I was afraid to scratch the cd's when removing and inserting.The Essential 3.0 Michael Jackson (Eco-Friendly Packaging)"
5,Great collection from a Musical Genius,"Michael Jackson has always Been Badd period. from his days as a Kid leading the Jackson5 to His Incredible Adult solo Run. His Vocal Instrument alone has touched so many lives.His Instrument of a Voice has gone through so many styles&Eras. no matter what the Era or what was the ""IN"" Sound or vibe you could always count on MJ hanging tough.His Voice as a Kid was that of a BluesMan in a Kid.He explored so many styles&Influenced so many era's of future Musicians. as a songwriter he has composed some of the Most Timeless songs Ever in ""don't Stop Till you Get Enough,Billie Jean,Beat It. His Vocals Lead&background have captured people all over the world&back.as a writer,producer,Arranger,Instrumentalist,conceptionilist,etc... He has His Own Mount Rushmore of Music Makers in the History of Making Music.for the new Listener to His Musical Genius this is a Great place to Start."
4,Good Album,"Great tracks selected for this album, I'm glad this is the one I chose to purchase from Amazon MP3 download"
5,All The Good Ones Are Here,"I love this CD. I already had it, but bought another one just for my car. I love me some Michael Jackson. Rest in peace sweet prince..."
4,Great old school Michael Jackson,"I really like this CD. It's got so much of the old school Michael Jackson I was looking for. It has a little more Jackson 5 that I might have wanted, but it really does the job when you are looking to get into the groove with some MJ tunes. Definitely recommend if you're looking to reconnect to some of his old music, as well as some of his later, more popular titles. It will make you want to sing and dance like you were when you were growing up. Great compilation of Jackson hits!"
4,the man and the music,"some people really can't distinguish between the man and the music. whether you like him or not as a person, or think he is in fact a pedophile or not, has nothing to do with this product. i must have missed where they were selling michael jackson himself rather than cds of his music, if you're not actually going to review the product please don't bother; you're wasting the time of people that genuinely want to know about this cd compilation.anyway, michael's music is amazing. it appeals to people of all generations and musical tastes. this collection offers a pretty good sampling that spans his career from his time with the jackson 5 to his solo hits, you get a little bit of everything, both fans and non-fans will appreciate having it in their cd collections."
3,Where Are 5 Of My Favs???,"THIS IS THE BEST COMPILATION I CAN FIND ANYWHERE, WITHOUT MAKING MY OWN ON LIMEWIRE OF COURSE. I WOULD BUY THIS BUT ITS MISSING 5 OF MY FAVS:'SCREAM''SAY,SAY,SAY''I'LL BE THERE''BLOOD ON THE DANCE FLOOR''DANCING MACHINE'IF JUST 'SCREAM' & 'I'LL BE THERE' WAS ON IT, I'D STILL BUY IT! REPLACE 'BEN' & 'ANOTHER PART OF ME' WITH THOSE AND YOU WOULD HAVE A WINNER!!! THIS STILL MAY BE WORTH THE BUY IF YOU CAN LIVE WITHOUT THESE 5 SMASHES.R.I.P. MICHAEL JACKSON.. LEGENDARY!!!!!!!!"
5,It's here,Package arrived in a very reasonable time. Looks great! I haven't listened to it yet because I bought it for my wife for her birthday.
5,Love It,All the song from the past and the present. Good quality. Three disc set. Some of the best Michael Jackson.
3,Essentially no justice,Fans don't listen to a few of M J's songs and feel they have made the connection to his music. The album The Essential Michael Jackson essentially does no justice when trying to put his entire catalog onto one album. I can't appreciate the scope of the music of Michael Jackson like this! Earl J.
4,good but not perfect,"Very good collection of Michael's songs, but there are three that could have been added to make it the perfect Greatest Hits. Those are Say Say Say with Paul McCartney, State of Shock with the Jacksons, and Scream with Janet. I don't understand why Say Say Say isn't on any of his greatest hits collections when it was a number one song for 6 weeks. Either way, this is something a true fan should have."
5,Essential CD,This CD is Awesome! It has all the great hits by Michael on it and a few I had forgotten about. It keeps you jamming even when you are sitting in traffic. The best collection by far!
5,Michael Jackson The Essential CD,Excellent CD! Has a good selection of his whole career. Was worth the purchase for the amount of songs on the CD.
3,2 songs absent make this non-essential!,"Scream and Earth Song are not here, so even if you get this 2 CD set, you will need to get the Number Ones to get Earth Song and who knows where you can get Scream--although I bought the video Vol. 2 to get that.So EPIC, did Michael really know you kept these 2 very essential songs off this 2 disc set? Shame on you."
3,Too much Michael for me.,"I got this, rather than greatest hits or #1's and then regretted it. A lot of his music is classic for all time, but a lot of the stuff on this double CD is not, in fact, essential, at least not to me. I should have gone for a more compact and limited compendium."
4,Great Collection save for a few omissions,"Okay, I am a big Michael Jackson fan, but how could ""I'll Be There"" and ""Dancing Machine"" not be on this?! Save for that, this woul've been a five star item. It is wonderful to hear the evolution of MJ's voice throughout the entire collection. My CD skips as well on the second disk around the song ""Dangerous."" Must be a manufacturing issue. This is a must-have if you are a long-time Jackson fan."
4,Almost....,"This is almost a definitive look at Jackson's career both with the J5 and solo. There's still a 5 star 1 disc compilation in Jackson's future. But as of 2005 there are none on the market. But the 2 disc's here (compiled chronologically) move along nicely. You get the Jacksons' biggest hits and Michael's early Motown solo hits. So, why isn't this a 5 star package? For one there's no ""Dancing Machine"", which is a cruel trick played by Epic/Legacy to make you buy one of the numerous J5 compilations with that song on it (or just download it). The liner notes consist of a few paragraphs that aren't worth anyone's time. And they included ""Dangerous"" a decent album cut that's not essential. Better choice would be ""Working Day And Night"". All told not a bad CD to have by Jackson if it's only a Greatest Hits CD you need."
2,"Michael Jackson's ""HIStory"" is a better deal!","Why is this compilation called ""The Essential Michael Jackson"" when 1) ""I'll Be There"" by the J5 is missing and 2) It has way too many edited versions of some of MJ's biggesthits. It need's to be re-worked and re-issued for future generations of Michael's fans. Clearly MJ did not put his stamp of approval on this one. He was still alive and wellwhen this was released."
3,He will be missed!,The songs are great but for some reason there are a couple of songs that the sound mixing just didn't come together. The music is too loud and it overpowers Michael Jackson's singing to the point where you can barely hear him at all.
5,Plantronics Headband,This is perfect for my 4+ hour teleconferences. The boom mike from the CS50 snaps right in and this makes for a very comfortable and functional hands free arrangement - much better and more stable than the boom mike with ear loop. This setup has never caused any discomfort and I highly recommend it for anyone with the need for extensive hands free telephony using the Plantronics CS50.
5,Great Headset - great replacement part,Simply wore out the first headband from use over the past couple of years .... This replacement part was a perfect replacement.
4,Headband Replacement,"I bought this headband to replace one I had been using for at least 5 years. The old one worked fine until the band cracked and I replaced it with this new one. So far, so good."
5,Great product :),"I did not have this piece, had a basic ear holder, that was very uncomfortable. With this headband I am loving it ! Thank you so much."
5,I wish it would have been required in 1986!!!!,"Being a non-traditional student, I needed this years ago. This would have uncovered the mystery of College for me as a teenager and explained so much that College courses just do not offer to Freshmen. I will hand this down to my children and encourage any parent to purchase it for all High School Seniors."
2,Irritates the gums and cheeks??,"i recently ordered this online thinking it would help me cure my gingivitis, well 4 days of using this 2 times a day i am now starting to think other wise...Because instead of my gums turning pink they turn a dark red after each brush and remain that way for an hour, then return to normal light red color.This toothpaste is not for every one be cautious of GSE liquid concentrate..if you are going to use it as a mouth wash, PLEASE DONT it will destroy your gum tissue"
3,8 days from order date to delivery date.,"Total time from order date to delivery date 8 days. Samsung original charger output 5v .7 amp. This Mizco charger SAMR225 output 5V - 12V, amps not stated but believed to be .8 amp. 5year ""limited"" warranty. Charger displays a red light when plugged into the wall. Amazon switched the vendor to SF Planet without asking me first."
4,Not bad for a generic charger.,"Although the charger is a little bulky, it's cheap and works just fine with the A-640. The charger also has a small green LED that lights up while plugged in."
4,Information that can save lives!,"This tape is a must for both women and men who want to protect themselves. Face it folks, life these days ain't getting any safer. Knowledge of self-defense is no longer a hobby but a necessity. This tape shows the viewers the situations under which they may be attacked and how to fight off the assailant. Though the tape seems to be meant for women, I recommend it for men as well."
4,hardcore is hardcore,"in this video it goes through most of the time that the hardcore title has existed,it shows a great match between the road dogg and al snow for the hardcore title , another match it shows is the street fight between triple h and cactus jack (mick foley) at the 2000 royal rumble for the wwf title. this video is hosted by tazz who would know alot about hardcore because he is a hardcore wrestler himself , ovarall i would recommend this video if you like hardcore matches or alot of brutality"
5,this is hardcore,this dvd was the most hardcore thing almost every match went backstage and so many weapons hardcore holly and al snow match ended at the missisipi river! if your a hardcore fan you gotta have this man the name says it all
1,Horrible,"The package was torn and dirty, the dvd case was broken in many places. I haven't even tried to use the dvd. Will not ever use this vendor again."
3,IT WAS O.K..I THOUGHT THEY WOULDA SHOWED MORE,"this is ok, they didnt show many hardcore matches...i know there was more than that and i wish they showed u more about there injuries. they show you the great st fight match between cactus and hhh even if it wasnt a hardcore title match, it saved this tape but if you are gonna get this for that match you rather get royal rumble 2000 because you get another no dq match..the tag team table match which was great!....what i liked about this was i got to see that road dogg vs alsnow match cause i remember watching it on raw and it was quite good....i didnt buy this i only hired this one out but i would save my money and get the royal rumble or wrestlemania 17, they got some mad no dq matches..or if it is very hardcore you want get a ecw dvd with barb wire matches with catus and terry funk. although it was a good video i would hire it first before you buy"
3,pretty weak,"hardcore matches are good and this has to be the worst collection of hardcore matches in a long time. Rhyno is'nt on it and he is hardcore, most of the matches consist on al snow vs road dogg or big boss man. most of the matches on the video arent even hardcore matches, you have street fights, no holds barred and tlc matches. The only good thing about this is the streetfight between foley and triple H. That is a fantastic match and worth the whole price it self. If its hardcore your after, your in the wrong federation"
4,"""Green"" or ""Hardcore""","I just have one question for anyone who bought this off of this website...Is your dvd called ""Green"" (if so...why?) or ""Hardcore"" because I bought this from a local store, and every store that sells them (along with the package itself) says ""Hardcore"" as the title. Nowhere on my amaray does it say ""Green"" nor does that title make any sense to me."
2,Hardcore?,"From the moment wwf tried to be hardcore it has just been a joke. Come on al snow vs road dogg is hardcore. Any hardcore fan would laugh at this tape. Money would be better spent on a juggalo championship wrestling tape then this one. If you really want hardcore check out the originators ECW. All the wwf hardcore division is, is a watered down ecw ripoff. Save your money."
4,Old Rugged Cross CD,An old favorite now on CD. It's heartwarming to hear Jo Stafford and and Gordon McRae's beautiful voices blended in these traditional songs.
5,Jesus,This cd gloriefies Jesus and especialy the song The Old Rugged Cross. This song was sang at my Great Grandmothers funeral in nineteen fifty. She was 100 years old . I will never forget it. There was not a dry eye in that old Presbyterian Church. Although converted at twelve years old at a Methodist Circuit Rider Revival in 1862 in Weatherford Texas. This song means a lot to me. This song will make non believer cry. This CD is highly reccommeded to every one.
4,Robin's Diary Review By Rachel,"The book ""Robin's Diary"" is a must read for General Hospital watchers. It insights on the everyday life of Robin and Stone, and makes us realize how strong love really is. I think that this book changed my opinon on AIDS, along with General Hospital.. It is a wonderfully written book, and only tells the real side of the story."
3,"""FRANKENSTEIN MEETS MEXICO""","It is fun and amusing in a weird sort of way to view these 1960's Mexi-Versions of Frankenstein! More of a 60's Study in Foreign Films with all the odd happenings and rich use of color! I recommend instead ""Santo Contra La Hija De Frankenstein"" (Santo vs. The Daughter of Frankenstein)a MUCH better Film! Viva La Frankenstein!"
2,So-so Santo,It's funny for the scene where Santo and the Blue Demon wear their masks while double-dating with two women at a fancy restaurant.The rest it fairly tedious.
5,Infant's Velcro Tap Shoes,I have no complaints. We replaced a different brand where the entire sole came off both shoes! I don't see that happening with these...they seem better-made. They were also tie-type.These Velcro ones are great and it's great that my daughter can put them on easily by herself in class. (trying to tie those short little ribbons were a bummer!). I will buy these again when we need the next size up!
1,Poor quality,"this tap shoes are the worst I have ever seen!! My poor little one complaints as they feel uncomfortable, hurt her little feet and they are putting her off her lessons!!! waste of money, time and motivation!!"
5,Howard would be proud!,"Well, if you don't already know who Robert Jordan is please ask whoever it is that has kept you locked in that closet to buy you the entire Wheel of Time series--and this book of course--before inserting you back into that dark, miserable vault. Then read them all voraciously. You will not be disappointed, with this or any of the other many books Mr. Jordan has written. This book in particular is probably the best Conan novel I have read in a great many moons. Why you ask? Well, the plotting is crisp and fast moving, the prose and dialogue effectively create action in the reader's mind, and as all of us RJ sycophants have come to expect, the characterizations are well done and extremely believable. A great book."
3,Super Reader,"This book is not as interesting as most of Jordan's others. I think the supporting cast is a little on the bland side, or only appear fleetingly in and out of the book. No Karelas or Hordos to be found here.Necromancer, evil femme fatale, good but naive girl he teaches a little bit of swordplay and shagging.Just an average tale."
2,"If you need to learn MARC, this isn't the tool for you","I started using this book to become familiar with all the MARC fields and tags, and how to use them. Except for the several mistakes in the answers, I thought that the first section (on 008 field) was very good. But I was sadly disappointed in the following sections. In fairness, the introduction of the book explains that this book is only to reinforce your understanding of MARC (but you didn't know that until you had the book in front of you). I assumed this was a book to teach how to use the MARC format. (I just ended up taking another few classes on MARC-- then I could understand this book-- defeats my purpose of having bought the book though). I haven't used the other 2 sections of the book (AACR2 & Authority control) so can't comment on those. But if you need to learn about MARC, this isn't the book for you."
1,slip,you may think this doll is nice and pretty but she is not. the plastic shirt is so cheesy. you can see through it. my little sister held it and the wings fell off. the little one is even more cheesier becauese my sister was holding it and it split in half. my little sister said she wanted to scratch my head off. the value of this doll is 3 fourths of a cent.
4,"High energy, fresh sound, great playing, and NEW","I bought this CD never having heard Louis Sclavis, strictly on my confidence in ECM's renaissance of great music of the past few years and the recommendation of a friend. It's a fantastic record that sounds fresh but reveals some interesting and unexpected influences. If you're up for an adventure give this a try."
5,"How to Live, Love and Die!","This is a book for 'Yesterday, Today and Forever because it puts into perspective the 'why' we are here and the 'how' of going about our lives. It helps us to understand the importance of dealing with the obstacles in our lives, and the joy of knowing that we are not alone, when life gets tough. Yes, I am a Christian, and a Catholic like Maria, and she made our redemption through the life of Christ, easier to understand, and embrace.She uses the Bible and many religious works, including the works of Josephus,for a proper understanding of Jewish thought and history, up to and around the time of Christ.These ideas are interwoven through the wonderful story of Maria and her family. I love this book, and recommend it to everyone. It's NOT preachy, and opens up a whole new perspective on the struggles of a family, and how they persevered. Hoorah!!!We need their spirit today. It's delightfully different from any book I have read before, and it's just my opinion."
4,Overwhelming,"There is so much awesome incredible information in this volume it boggles the mind that two people that never met face to face were responsible for it.I love the history of wrestling, championship lineages in particular. It amazes me that certain men never held heavyweight gold, like Scott Hall or Owen Hart, and others only in one federation but not another, like Vader or Lex Luger in the WWF. This book doesn't illustrate who was more popular or who had more sway in the thick of things, but who held the titles and that's that.Yes its outdated, the cutoff date being late 1999, but there's so many foreign and independent histories here its just too easy to get lost flipping through it again and again, years after publication.Truly a great book that will only be replaced if an updated volume if ever released, but that's unlikely as a rumorued website will be the next iteration. Either way, awesome stuff."
3,mediocre.....,"I found this book pretty mediocre. It also drags and is not as easy to read as others. It was ""ok"" but I won't be recommending it to my adopting friends. The family's story is fine, but the mom is not really that great of a writer."
4,Literate story telling with a dark edge,"HANDCUFFED to a fence in Mississippi is not a usual place to begin an album. But then the last thing Jim White could be described is run of the mill. A former New York cab driver turned singer, his life fell apart after the release of his totally distinctive ""One Eyed Jesus"" debut. Happily now back on track, the string of producer credits hint that this was a tough album to make.For the uninitiated, White is a very alternative country performer, combining modern effects with dark tales of Southern madness and religion. Some of the material here is heaven sent. For example White invests Corvair, a lullaby for a disused car, with all the sadness in the world. At his best, White's lyrics are miniature short stories to rival those of Southern writer Flannery O'Connor.It does lose its way in the middle, but if you like adventurous roots music, you really should search this out."
4,"You can dress a p*g, but can you put it on LETTERMAN (6/12)?","i guess so?...unless it hollers. Congratulations to Mr. White on his LATE NIGHT appearance this Tuesday, June 12.Although I can play ""No Such Place"" more times than the latest Grandaddy or Whiskeytown, I feel Jim's CD is playing hard to get. Tracks like ""Corvair,"" ""Seldom (Christmas Day),"" ""10 Miles to go...,"" ""Handcuffed to a Fence in MS,"" and ""The Wound that Never Heals"" are the rouge, the middle part of the album are uneven, flabby bits. Mr. White, you need to work out! Otherwise you'll only have baby biceps with rough-material-enough-for-brilliant-EPs-only. Get STUDIOus, kid."
4,"Wow, this is good stuff!","I like it a lot. It reminds me of Morphine, though I cannot say Jim White sounds like Morphine - it's just the closest I can come to analogy here. What I love about this music is how different it is from the usual mainstream sound. If you like Morphine, I am certain you will like this group too (and vice versa). It also reminds me of the Play album by Moby. In my comparison, please don't get the idea that Jim White's sound is a copy or imitation of these or any another group, as it really isn't. It's an original sound and style whose time has come. Almost five stars, almost!!!"
5,Lyrical Bliss,"This CD starts out with the cheeky number ""Handcuffed to a fence in Mississippi"" which instantly grabs you. Not only for the catchy mixture of an almost alternative rockabilly sound but by the lyrical minglings that are far too captivating to be overcome even by great music.It is quickly followed by a beautifully haunting number called ""The wound that never heals"" and ""Corvair"" which probably has more interpretations than I could list. I loved the old muted steel wound string guitar he uses in that number.By the second listen I was inescapably hooked on almost every track on this CD. Very highly recommended.PS: Thanks to J. Graham for introducing me to the far too unknown lyrical genius, Jim White."
4,A helpful learning tool,"I am an MSW student and have found this book extremely helpful as I concomitantly study the DSM-IV-TR. Combining the reading of, for example, anxiety disorders in the DSM with Austrian's chapter on anxiety disorders helps clarify assessment criteria. I don't believe the purpose of her book is to discuss the shortfalls of the DSM but rather to aid social workers in gaining a better grasp of its contents. I see her introduction as a disclaimer. The DSM is a necessary evil - whether we like it or not, many of us work in environments where its use is unavoidable. Given that, Austrian provides her opinion, rightfully in the introduction, and then gets down to business with the purpose of the book. I do recommend this book for people wanting to learn, but can't speak for those who feel they have already learned it all."
2,WebObjects description document,"This book is only for beginners or people who want to know what you can do with WO. If you are Wo programmer or you have already read the tutorial, maybe you don't need this book."
2,No focus involved,"By the time you get a forth of the way in the book you finally start talking about WebObjects at all really. The rest talks about his version (fairly poor at that) of history and philosophies behind computers. The book is a buzzword seller, with no real value at all. He tries to impress you with a weak history and tossing of buzzwords than any real knowledge. People like him are the reason that programming jobs are going down hill. Write less code in the long run by doing it right the first time, skip this book. WebObjects will not increase development speed unless your developers are uneducated in design and coding procedures. If that is what WebObjects pushes, no wonder they are failing in the market. That is a Microsoft gimmick and has yet to work properly even for them. I am still in my quest to find what WebObjects holds in advantage to other languages and platforms. In any event, unless you don't know computers at all this book is more than a waste."
5,SUPER DIVERTIDO Y DE LECTURA LIGERA,Empece a leer este libro un martes por la tarde y lo acabe antes de ir a dormir. Ahora lo estoy leyendo por segunda vez. Me mato de risa como no se imaginan. Pero no es humor barato. Es muy bien trabajado por el autor aunque se sienta tan fresco y natural. Y para los peruanos que estamos fuera trae muchos recuerdos de nuestra Lima a la memoria.
3,Easy reading,"I am from Peru, Where the author is from. This story tells a lot of the society in Lima,and describes well the situations and the reaction from the peolple living them.A bit too hard commented by the author but still very close to reality,a bit of revenge and indifference from the author, Ive read No se lo digas a nadie also"
3,"Good reading, better characters","I found this novel much better than "" No se lo digas a nadie."" It was developed much better than his first novel and touched on similar themes and sub-themes, especially the hipocrisy of the society in Lima, and self-willing blindness. The characters also seemed more complete, more well-rounded. I think most important, the message of the book is more positive, which contrasts with the anger of his first novel."
1,Junky XM Sportscaster Headphones,"When it works, this is a nice low-end portable XM unit. The major drawback is the heaphones. The cable that plugs into the Sportscaster receiver is not very sturdy. Eventually the wires inside the cable break, and the headphones won't work anymore. The Sportscaster will just display ""Check Antenna"". Since the headphones have the XM antenna inside, you can't just replace them with somethng else.When my first set of these headphones stopped working, the company replaced them under warranty. Now that the second set has stopped working, I gave up and purchased a different XM receiver rather than invest any more money in this poorly designed product."
1,Hmmm.... interesting...,"Well, I can say that this book did nothing for me. I'm sorry to be harsh, but the tone was whiney, and implied ""See? I'm better than all of you but I still like sleepovers!"" In short, after reading this book, I kicked over a crate of them at a [local] bookstore..."
4,Music does flow in her blood,"After reading this book, you'll know what music is to Charlotte; it's in her. I thought the book was well written. I don't know why some people seem to be passionately against her. One reviewer says Charlotte doesn't write about her music, but that's not true. Most of this book IS about her music! As a matter of fact, I bought ""Voice of an Angel"" after reading this book. I only wish she showed her Welshness more in the book."
5,Magnificent!,"This is a vividly written autobiography. I cannot give away much, but I surely can say that Charlotte Church is a wonderful writer, as well as a brilliant singer! Highly recommended; you will not be disappointed."
5,Charlotte Church,"Charlotte Church is great! This will not be the best book you've ever read, but if you like books like ""The Princess Diaries"" where you feel like you are talking to the person it's about, this book is for you. In this book she writes to you like you are her best friend. Being a big fan of hers it was really fascinating. However, I can understand that the writing style of this book would only appeal to teenage girls."
5,A 14 year olds view of her extraordinary life so far.,"Charlott Church gives her impressions of an anything but ordinary life from an ordinary teenager's perspective.She gives her impressions of what she felt; her love of singing, dealing with sudden fame, meeting famous people, traveling the world and working very hard.Most of all, she tells of what she found was most important, her family and friends.This is a delightful book by a 14 year old trying to sort out her life as a 14 year old views her life so far."
1,a joke of a biography,"I can't imagine anyone buying this book because I feel Charlotte Church is too young for the biography to mean anything. ""My life so far"" implies that the book is not complete, but somehow Charlotte is so great that she deserves to have a book out now. Why can't she wait until she is a little older to tell us all? Many other people have accomplished just as many things as Charlotte and decided to wait until they had more material to write for a book. I would seriously question the value of reading something like this, since Charlotte refers to ""mum"" and ""dad"" so many times it makes you wonder about the literary quality. A biography is supposed to document one's life but if you are so young, you really haven't lived. Hence, there is nothing really to document. And consequently, there is nothing really of interest to read in this book."
1,"Please, Who are you?","Charlotte Church may seem like an interesting girl and I hate to spoil the rumors, but she is not. Reading this book was like tripping over onto a pair of scissors into my eyes. Of course, reading the book was not as thrilling as that. Charlotte Chruch has no business to ever write again and I pray that her voice don't get broke or she'll have nothing left."
5,good choice,"This lived up to my expectations perfectly. Great fit, excellent quality and I found it easy to operate my Sansa in the case."
3,"Fun, but...","My 2 1/2 year old daughter LOVES the Little Einsteins shows/videos. She had a lot of fun playing with this toy, but I have two complaints.One, similar to previous reviews, the ""Do-Re-Mi"" sung by the character buttons is out of tune. Ugh. However, my husband pointed out that the characters often sing out of tune on the TV show/videos too. So maybe they are just trying to stay consistent? I don't mind it so much on the show, but for $20 I'd like the notes in tune.Second, the instrument knobs that move up and down have to be placed ""just so"" next to the red dots in order to make them play their little tune. A child will, no doubt, eventually learn that. But they might ignore that part of the toy for a while until they do.Those things said, I can't deny that my daughter loved the toy. The Little Einstein characters and familiar music were the draw."
2,Why can't they do it right?,"I was thinking about buying this for my daughter, but when I tried it out at the store, the little characters sang ""do re me"" etc. but completely out of tune! Would it have been so hard to program it in tune? Why not do it right so kids could actually learn something? Another example of someone's good idea done badly."
2,"A revision might make this into a decent toy, but...","The solfege buttons at the top of the toy weren't even close to being in tune to a major scale. Hopefully, they will consult a musician and revise this product. This problem alone makes this is an irritating noisemaker."
4,Little Einstein Music,"This musical toy is great if you have a child who loves music like mine...Fun music to be made, gets them dancing and seems to be very durable since its been dropped many times and keeps playing..."
1,out of tune and misadvertised,"This toy offers badly synthesized versions of instruments playing in the wrong octave. The levers do not change pitch, they change the volume of the instruments in the mix. The characters sing out of tune. My three year old spent 10 minutes with this toy, and we haven't seen it since."
3,Good Car Toy,"Everytime my 3 year old son goes to the toy store, he plays with this toy. I wasn't about to pay full price for it ($20), because I didn't think it would hold his attention for long. I purchased the toy after it went on clearance. It is a wonderful take along toy. He loves to hear the different instruments: piano, bassoon, trumpet, harp, flute, and violin. I don't think the characters sound too off key as the other reviewers were complaining. My son is now learning and repeating the names of great composers (ie...""Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Johann Sebastian Bach""). Overall, it is an okay toy. It does not hold his attention for long, but he has always enjoyed music and seems to like listening to this toy."
4,Definitely Helpful,"It is certainly a very helpful resource for most people who don't get to learn much about the mortgage market and industries. I certainly had to buy a home during the turmoil and it helped me shed some light on mortgage industries, how brokerage industries work and so forth. Also it includes lots of things that you should ask or consider when you are getting a mortgage."
5,A must have!,"This is absolutely a great book to read. It is very easy to understand and very straight forward. I highly recommend it for anyone who are looking into buying a home.....right away or in the future. It will save you a lot of money and time. This is the first time that I have ever written a review for a book. Yes, I like it that much! In fact, I am buying three more so I can give my sisters each a copy this Christmas. If after reading my review and you find it to be too good to be true......do what I sometime do. Go to your local book store. Find this book.....scan through it and see if you feel the same way before buying a copy."
3,"Not as good as ""Satchidinanda"" but good","I just bought this record so it's still growing on me. It is quite different than ""Journey to Satchidinanda"" and ""Ptah the el Daoud"" though. Organ is prominent on this record as well as drums. It gives these songs a different feel than ""Satchidinanda""; specifically, less meditative and more high energy. That's not necessarily a bad thing though -- just different. As I said, I need to listen to it a few more times, but my initial reaction is it's good -- just not as good as ""Journey"" or ""Ptah."""
3,Does The Job,"I purchased this product having just committed to one year plus with a full mouth of braces. I have been using it for four months now and it has so far stood the test of time. It will not, however, last forever. It is lightweight and travels with me almost everywhere. I use it after meals for a quick clean. It feels great on the gum line and my Orthodontist constantly remarks on the great upkeep of my teeth (I also use and panasonic electric toothbrush). If I had a bigger apartment, I would certainly commit to a more serious, larger machine...but if you're pressed for counter space and on the go this will suit you just fine. I have no problem filling the tank a few times, but I do wish it was under $30.00 because I have a feeling (because of constant use) I will have to replace it before the year is up."
2,MADDEN,NOT TOO IMPRESSED WITH THIS ONE. WORKMANSHIP IS OK BUT THE OVERALL QUALITY DISSAPOINTS ME. IM USUALLY HAPPY WITH STEVE MADDEN SHOES BUT NOT THIS ONE.IM SURE ILL WEAR IT SOMETIMES BUT I WOULDNT CALLE THIS ONE A WINNER.
4,The Joy of Cola,This is a good CD with many good songs on it. I got it for an affordable price. It rocks! I totally reccomend this CD!
3,this cd is okay,"this cd has some okay songs on it. it has some really good old and new songs on it, but the cd isn't overall that great. Pepsi dosen't really accomadate to the yonger people, more in the late 20's and 30's. I liked some songs, but some of the others weren't nearly as good the songs that are around today.I would say that if you like this type of music, then go for it and buy this cd. I hope you found this review helpful."
2,Be careful with your facts,"I found this book to be interesting but also amusing. While it does provide some basic information about Cuban baseball, the book is plagued with mistakes about Cuban history and culture. Any student of Cuban history is aware that, at the outset of the revolution, Castro was not the president of Cuba. This is but one example of the many historical errors that detract from the book's value. There are also transcription errors that could have been avoided had anyone cared to correct the Spanish. It is also unfortunate that the authors do not understand race relations in Cuba, and impose concepts familiar to U.S. culture on a totally different reality. After much anticipation, I am frankly embarrassed that this book may be quoted and used to write others."
1,A book for the uninformed,"This book is an insult to Cubans because of its unqualified praise of Fidel Castro's dictatorship. The authors seem to think that Cuba owes its baseball accomplishments to Castro and overlook the forty years of repression, the political prisoners, and the thousands of Cuban families separated thanks to the Maximum leader. Some of the pictures are interesting, but there are many mistakes in the identification of players and Tony Oliva appears batting from the right! This is a book for the uninformed."
2,some problems to work on,"An Almendares Blue pitcher in red on the cover shows the kind of problems that are in this book. Lennox Pearson's picture is identified as Panch'on Herrera, and Jos'e Valdivielso's as Asdr'ubal Bar'o. Tito Fuentes an outfielder? This book can misinform the uninformed; the pictures and the paper are good."
3,Not Good for XL Size Hand,"Years ago I owned a standard 110 and bought this variant because I like the finger grip design. I wound up sending it back for an exchange. However, the 110FG is great for anyone with a S,M,or L glove size. If you have to buy an XL glove size, the 110FG is so uncomfortable it will make the knife feel unnatural in your hand. Instead of your fingers resting comfortably inside the finger grooves, they'll press against the ridges as opposed to resting solely in the troughs. BOTTOM LINE: If you have a smaller hand, the 110FG is great. If you have an XL hand, go for the standard 110. It costs less and fits an XL hand nicely."
4,It's a buck need I say more?,"I have had this knife for about 3 years. I bought this knife for a good every day work and defense. I highly recommend a good saddle leather quick draw holster, look them up got mine on e-bay. As for the knife it is the good old Buck knife. the finger groves are ok they take time to get used to. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because of the groves. The look of the knife is beautiful you have to look real close at the brass ends to even see the pins at the top and bottom of the knife. All in all this knife will last you the rest of your life, take care of it and it will take care of you!"
5,Just about the best basic larger knife made,"this knife is GREAT. benefitting from a tried and true design and a quality company, the 100FG is WELL worth the money. Solid craftsmanship and components. Fits the hand very well too i might add. solid locking device and blade. If the size is appropriate for you, then this knife is a great choice."
4,If you love Classic Giant Robots...,"YOU'LL LOVE GETTER ROBO! Heck if you just love action, kick a** characters and a robot that truly rules you'll love Getter Robo.CHANGE GETTER... IS NUMBER ONE!"
4,Excellent Brahms 3rd,"I would echo the other reviewers who marvel at the energy in these recordings by the octogenarian Pierre Monteux. The Brahms 3rd, which befuddles a number of good conductors, is performed wonderfully here. The Schumann, although better recorded, sounds rushed to me in spots. The Rossini overture and the brief interview are nice fillers."
4,GREAT PPV!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Judgment Day was ausome! The tag team turmole was good, and hhh vs. KANE was aunome very brutle, stone cold comes out after KANE gives the Choke Slam but still doesnot help much! Then the main event UNDERTAKER VS. STONE COLD Great match I wish KANE came out sooner though to beat HHH it is his falt THE UNDERTAKER didnot win! But this is still a great video Great video for fans of UNDERTAKER and KANE."
3,very average.,"this ppv was better than backlash 2001 but still lacked in alot of ways, Austin vs. undertaker was a boring match with no real suprises, lita vs. chyna is only good to look at, tag team turmoil is a good match with a fairly okay supries partner for jericho, benoit vs. angle best 2/3 falls match was good but the ladder match wasnt that great the other two were good. HHH vs. Kane was better than i expected, then there are other matches that just arent even good enought to be mentioned."

3,eh....,"This wasn't a bad PPV....It was well....MediocerI luckily had a friend tape this for me and I checked it out.I wasn't very big one the matches except forUNDERTAKER VS AUSTIN For the wwe championship.Sadly the dead man didn't get there. But hey!!! I was rooting for taker since he is my favorite wwe wrestler.Even though he didn't win the title atleast he won the wwe championship at the next Judgment Day. Wierd coincedence hu?HHH VS Kane in a chain match wasn't the best KANE/HHH MATCH I've ever seen.These men have had lots and lots of battles together.There best would have to be the one on RAW when it was HHH/Kane for Wwe championship and if kane had lost he would have had to take off his mask.Kane won but Undertaker didn't, so I would have to say I was disapointed with this PPV. I'm not going to review the rest of the matches But I will say they were pretty good.I give this a 3.2 out of 5.later..."
2,"It is called flat, but it is not","The product is called flat bark, but it is not flat, it is the shape of a small tree. I even sent the product back to the vendor and they ordered another one and is was the same shape. I am not sure what the word flat in it's name means or way the photo shows flat, but it is round."
4,NCIS - 2nd Season,"It will always keep you on the edge of your seat. there is always a turn at the end so who you thought did, didn't and do... Gibbs always get the bad guy."
4,happy with it...,Well be back again if there is something else i want... Very happy with them... DVD's work good... Good good...
3,Season 1,Who wouldn't love a boss who smacks you on the back of the head because the face is humiliating?
5,Good purchase,Absolutely no problems. The case is in great shapes and the DVDs work perfectly. This is a great company. I highly recommend them.
5,NCIS FAN,"Episode with Charles Durning , one of televisions greatest moments.Emmy worthy.Outstanding performance of patriotism, defining the lasting effects of war and militarylife on the men and families of those who so proudly served this country in its' greatest need.Touching, poiniant, and Gibbs-ish to the very end.A tribute to all who have, are now, and will in the future, serve our country."
3,I LOVE NCIS!,"I bought Season 2 on Christmas night with money i had received as a gift. I was shocked at how quick it came and how well packaged it was. It was raining the day it was delivered and the mail man just placed it on my porch. IT was double packaged so the dvds were safe. When i played it however, ALL the dvds in the season skipped the first chapter of each show. I had to try a few times to contact the seller and never heard anything back until after i reported him to amazon. he was polite about the whole thing and said sorry that they didnt work but that he cant exchange it b/c he was out of stock and that he would refund the money and asked that i just throw out the set. He refunded my money that day. Im happy with the way he handled himself even after being reported."
5,American Treasure,"American's Greatest Living Actor makes a memorable appearance - cast as a hero....no surprise there, as he really is one. Charles Durning, who has distinguished himself in his profession, is also a WWII hero, winning the Silver Star for Gallantry in Action - and 3 Purple Hearts for wounds. Here he gives a lovely, lyrical, and nuanced performance as a aging and confused hero tortured by his past. It is a quietly acted tour de force - watch the old guy show the young actors who it's really done! Watch carefully for the scene where his Medal of Honor is revealed to the officer and guards who have come to arrest him. Don't miss the expression on his face that follows...one of quiet satisfaction that ""Yes...they understand what it means."""
4,Pity about Kate,Have found these very good. Thoroughly enjoy the series so neat to have them permanently and go back through them. This series is good to have if you liked Kate.
5,NCIS Second season,"Enjoying watching the series unfold through the episodes, seeing the characters and ensemble work to share the stories and pull me in."
5,NCIS Season 2,I bought this as a gift. Came in on time and much cheaper than anywhere else I looked.
5,NCIS Season 2-Spectacular,I can't get enough NCIS. I am a newbie and have been in the dark about what is going on. Sooooo the best way is to start with Season 1 and watch each consecutive episode. It is sweeeet!! I love these guys and how everything falls into place. You may be introduced to something or one....and then weeks later....there it/he/she is again. Actually...I am now half way through season 3. Good stuff....very entertaining...great actors!!!
5,One of my favorite seasons!,"NCIS is definately my favorite TV show & has been since the 1st season. The 1st two seasons with Kate are my favorites. They were more about the ""crimes"", with a great mix of wit, charm, and delightful banter between the cast. They don't dwell on the charactors private lives except as it pertains to a particular episode. The characters all work as a team instead of ""hiding info, etc"" from other team members. The episodes are more self-contained and not an ongoing theme that spans several episodes or the whole season."
5,Great Show,"This is a great show, it gets better and better. The second season is a hit with the addition of McGee. The banter between him and DiNozzo is hysterical."
5,Great show,I have been hooked on this show since the beginning - I plan on purchasing all of the seasons so I can enjoy them all over again... minus the commercials!
4,Bone Yard Review,"I enjoy all of the NCIS shows, rating them as a positive is not a problem.What I resent is having to pay for the site and then paying $1.99 to watch each show. Sure, I 'own' the show then but I would prefer an option of no charge renting or a fee for buying. I don't know if CBS requires it be Fee TV or Amazon but I feel that once it goes to Amazon or Netflix or anything else like that, the shows should always have a choice of it being of no charge.JMHO"
4,Kissaluvs Fitted Diapers,"Kissaluvs Size 0 Fitted Diapes do a great job containing the runny newborn poop. They are not overly bulky and have fit my son well since birth. They are easy to wash and take care of. My only complaint is that they are not very absorbent by themselves. Even though I change him at every feeding, he still soaks through the diaper and has wet clothing quite often. I use an extra insert occasionally, but that adds extra bulk."
2,expected better fit,"These diapers had great reviews for being a good fit to infants. However, first of all it was the wrong fit for my baby who was not a big baby. He weighted 7 pounds at birth. He only wore these for three weeks and outgrew them. These diapers also did not absorb as I had expected. My son needed to be changed as they got soaked right away. They are cute but, I expected a better fit, and more absorbency."
2,Soaked Easily,I stocked up on these based on all the great reviews and both my husband and I did not like them and are looking to trade them in. They fit fine but when we would go to change our daughter they would be soaked. I don't know if it was from pee or sweat. We liked the pocket diapers better so far and all in ones.
2,kissaluvs cloth diapers,Just a warning you will need a cover with these diapers and since they are so bulky with a cover I would recommend you use something else. I think these fitted diapers are so cute but not exactly practical.
1,ABSOLUTELY Not worth it,"This book was terrible. The directions were vauge and not centered on the topic. I must have spent 14 hours trying to figure out what the heck the book was saying, with no help whatsoever from the CD. I'm not some new-user who doese'nt even know what a file is, but i'm not a world-class programmer, so i do'nt have time to understand a badly-written book. Don't get this book unless you want another piece of firewood."
4,"Very good, but redundant. Why doesn't the cover say ""Vol 1""?","This is an excellent introductory book. The first problem is that a great deal of the material is a rehash of ""Windows Game Programming for Dummies"". If you own that book, understand that before you buy. There's more meat to it, though. If you don't own WGPDumb, then this is a must buy. I think most readers are really looking for the material that DIDN'T make it into this book - and is promised for ""Volume 2"". Where on the cover of this book - front or back - does it say that this is ""Volume 1""?? The pre-release ad copy for this book posted by the online booksellers described material that clearly ISN'T in this volume - and that's not right. Andre, keep up the good work, and post uncorrupted versions of the CDROM files on your website - pronto!"
5,Excellent beginners book!,"Im new to game programming, and i recently picked this book up. Now there are only a coupld of books dedicated to game programming that i have seen. This book definitly tops it off, even if you dont know C or C++ theres a primer in the back of the book. Theres also a review of trigonometry. Its unlike other resources where the writing is cryptic. Its in plain english, and easy to understand. For hard core veterans, you would probably not want this(then again if you are a veteran why are you buying more game programming books?) I suggest all beginners and intermediates get this book!"
2,A controversial book,"Even the title contradicts itself. Tricks of the gurus/fundamentals of game programming. Well, I got fooled by the tricks part and only got a book about fundamentals. If you have done a small game or even a small prototype of a game with DirectX, you probably don't really need this book. In other words: if you know some DirectX stuff, you'll qualify as a guru if this book is used as a measure.For a complete beginner, add a star or two..."
2,"this book is the same as ""Windows game prog. for dummies""","Attention readers : if you already have ""Windows Game Programming for dummies"", do NOT buy this book. Most of it is just a copy-and-paste from the Dummies book. The additional content (the book is about 1000 pages long) is definitely not worth buying. The two ""bonus"" chapters in the Dummies book are now included in the print, which explains the difference in size. And don't get carried away by the ""3D"" in the title : there is almost NO 3D content in this book. LaMothe says those who want to know about 3D should read the ""second tome"", what a joke ! This book doesn't exist, and I already paid for supposedly ""3D"" knowledge. For those who haven't read the Dummies book, it is still a good investment of time and money. But they had rather buy the Dummies book. Others, forget it."
2,False advertising,"1.) This is not a 3D book and I don't care if there are ""bonus"" chapters on a CD. It was a book that I was spending my money on. 2.) The CD DOES have problems and this fact is even acknowledged on MacMillan publishings web site ( by the way, my CD failed on several PC's ). So, the previous post stating the problem is with my PC should get his head out of his ass since he doesn't have a clue what he's talking about. Your review should be based on your experiences alone. Don't presume to know what my problems are! False advertising and CD problems earn this book 2 stars regardless of the quality of the material in the book. I don't appreciate being misled."
3,It didn't live up to the hype,"Ok, after reading his original Tricks of the Game Programming Gurus, I was expecting a lot more. This book covers a lot of the same material, but is for DirectX instead of DOS. Now, this alone is great, and if you are familiar with his original book then reading the new one is easier. However, I have found NUMEROUS errors in the book and it seems as if it was rushed to press. The book doesn't cover anything with any more detail than can be found elsewhere. Also, there are times when I leave this book to hunt up Michael Abrash's Black Book instead because Andre uses an easy to understand routine instead of a known faster one. If this is the angle he's shooting for, then perhaps it should be titled ""Tricks of the Windows Game Programming Beginners"" instead. The book is a good reference for learning DirectX programming, but after reading numerous articles and books by him I don't think it's some of his better work."
5,Excelent Book,"This was my first book on game programing , and everyone must agree with me that this book covers a lot.It teaches you some Windows programing(Win32 API) , DirectX6.0 (Direct3d on the CD),and some programing techniques (believe me that will be enought for a start:D).After reading this book ,I turned on the computer and started creating what before was only on my dreams, I started creating GAMES.... (Obs:Just for the record ,I suceeded creating a game that mimics Diablo's fighting style[point,click,kill],and I used the Vampire's battle rules...and it was the third game I created after reading this book.Great work Andre! )"
3,An EASY read but nothing in-depth,"I've been programming for 3 years now in C++ and the book is VERY easy to understand in terms of sample code and concepts. In fact much of the book is fluff and only covers the very basics in DirectDraw. He neglects important features such as sprite structures and other class that are covered in the DX help files. Don't get me wrong, the book is definitely help and helped get my feet wet but don't expect to pull off anything amazing by simply reading the book. The best thing to do is to put the book away and start coding and reference the DirectX help files. He constantly teachs old code from C and ancient algorithm that have long been replaced by DirectX. The reader is led to believe his code is the most effective when in fact DirectX provides ones that are MUCH better. Oh yeah, no D3D help here. I hope his next book will be less inflated and more focus and up-to-date."
3,Not for Beginners,"Game programming is phenominally difficult. Arkanoid (an ancient arcade game) contains more than eight pages of code, full of very difficult math subjects. The book is an excellent resource for anyone with very very solid math and programming experience; but you MUST have this experience or you may as well buy the book in Spanish because it will make that much sense to you. If you can write BASIC, it won't help you here. You need advanced C++ to get through this book!"
4,An understandable Professionnal Gaming Book,"The title says it all !This is a professionnal Gaming Book that takes you from the real beginning of gaming development, such as Game Design, to the end of what is ""writable"".The last thing to do is just be creative and well organized."
2,sigh,"Andre, Andre, Andre.... When will you use a compiler put out in this millenium? All of your books look so informative, and yet you can't write a book using a tool we can all buy in the store. You make me so sad."
3,"Good Topic, a lot of bad form.","I'm disappointed by the fact that the cover says Fundamentals of 2D and 3D Game Programming...when the 3D will be in a second book. Some of it is on the Disk, but still.... Misleading... Also, it says on the book that it uses the latest DirectX. It covers 6.0 and mentions 7.0. If your're using the latest DirectX you should be using 7.0, not just talking about it. Don't you think? Also, what's with the <BG> all over? Are we on-line chatting? I don't think so. Quit with the silly comments and give me some meat! Anyway, this is a good book if you are beginning programming and want to start programming games. As an experienced Windows Programmer I find a lot of the assumptions about Windows Programming are wrong, but, just my opinion. If you know very little about game programming, then this is a good book to start with. If you know a lot about 2D game programming and want to learn about 3D then wait for book 2."
2,Pitiful,"I must agree with the previous reviewer. The only reason why I give the book two stars is for the decent information on the CD. This is NOT the book that was first advertised, this is <ahem> ""Volume I"" (Which really is just a rehash of windows game prog for dummies). The 3D stuff is apparently in Volume II. What a waste."
4,"Not As Advertised, But Still Great","According to Andre the man himself, this edition is not the complete manuscript -- it's part 1 of 2. He apparently wrote way too much to fit into 1 book, so late in the writing process he decided to split it into 2 volumes.As it stands, it is an excellent introduction to the world of 3D game programming. You really can't learn 3D game programming without understanding something about 2D game programming first (well you can, but it's just much easier this way), so don't get you stockings in a knot if you think this book isn't as informative about 3D programming as advertised -- just be patient, and wait for the next volume -- this is only the intro."
2,Wasn't worth the wait,"Am I the only one getting sick of ""bonus"" chapters on CD? Even when learning about programming, there are times when I prefer to sit down with a book AWAY from the computer. The first reviewer got it right when he said this is basically just a rehash a LaMothe's ""for Dummies"" book which was a good intro to Windows game programming. However, this time round I was really expecting more. What a disappointment."
4,great book for the beginner,"I loved this book from the start, some people might not like LaMothe's very personal writing style, but to me it felt like he was talking to ME which makes the book very pleasant to read. Tons of examples, both for the beginner and more experienced programmers about the most common gaming problems. However this book is for 2d, the 3d stuff is on the CD and who likes to try to read 100+ pages of word documents? Also I miss DirectPlay, network games are almost the standard these days."
3,"Good concepts, but cluttered code","This book is excellent for teaching the theory behind game design, including physics and hit detection. However, I found the code very cluttered. His programming style is awkward and he uses unnecessary header files. One example is a blitting demo in chapter 7. There's great examples to go along with it, but the actual code is well over 1000 lines. I created the same demo using only 500 lines of code.Overall though, for someone wanting to get into serious game development on any platform, this book is a must. I'd buy it just on the collision detection, physics and AI chapters by themselves. 3 stars for those items, and 2 taken off for bloated coding."
5,The best book ever?,"Yep, it sure is. A superb book, that teaches you the strategyof creating games, not just the raw code it'self. You'll need to befairly advanced in C/C++ to get anything out of the book, otherwise you'll find yourself re-reading over bits, and looking up what the hell he's going on about - not for the beginner programmer at all. You'll also need to be very competent with maths, enough to understand matrices, vector rasterisations etc. I was well impressed with Andres AI section, alot of food for thought there. Overall, a VERY VERY good book, I've read it about 4 times now, and a must to buy if you are at all serious about game programming. Can't wait for volume II !"
4,A Great Place To Start,"The author takes a mysterious topic and makes it easy to understand. Despite the book's flaws, I haven't come across a better source for the programmer who wants to get into game development. An enjoyable read, definitely worth the money."
3,"For beginners, not for experienced people","This book is very well written for beginners. But if you are more experienced game developer, forget about this book. I was looking for 3D isometric engines and I found only 2 pages of general recommandations I already knew. Another very disappointing thing is dependance on DirectX. What about OpenGL? I do not want to be the next slave of Microsoft. Another problem is you don't find anything about 3D in this book. OK, let me also say some positive thinks. Nice surprise was the chapter about AI. Of course, it is absolutelly trial, but nicely written. If the author plans to write a new book my suggestion is: concentrate only on some topics - graphics, data structures, AI and write it for more advanced developers. For beginners you have already written enough books."
4,Decent 2D Games book with intro thoughts on every subject,Two complaints. The CD had a few files that could not be read. No 3D coverage (as mentioned in many other reviews). Otherwise the book has an enjoyable writing style and gives you the basics on doing things with some good examples (or just some interesting ideas to think about) -- which I believe is all a person should need to get jumpstarted. Then you can reference the real boring books to get the specific knowledge you need. This is a book I would give to my friends who always wanted to make a game and had little experience in writing one.
2,Waste of Money,"I bought this book expecting to get some serious ""tricks,"" however it turned out to be just a poor rehash of material from Tricks of the Game Programming Gurus. ALL, and I mean every last scrap of the information was basic, introductorly level material. But the most obvious problem with the book is that is cover so little on DirectX. Lamothe basically gives you a shabbily done version of the help files included with the Directx SDK. Information on 3d graphics is glaringly absent. The Directx portion of the book covers maybe 150-200 pages, the rest is banal knowledge on physics, Win32, and AI. All of it done in a cursory, unprofessional manner. This book is *not* worth the asking price. It WILL NOT teach you how to program in Directx, and if you already know how, it will not teach you anything new or usefull."
5,Fond Memories Abound!,"First time author, Joe Martinelli, has created his own niche with Rememberances. I kept smiling while reading this book. His depiction of Italian family life and his fondest boyhood memories made me nostalgic for an era gone by."
4,More Than Reflections,"It is easy to discern that Mr Martinelli is not a natural writer. Reflections of his life in Walnut Hills' Little Italy come sporadically, often times in a succession of non-linear thoughts, making it difficult for the reader to keep all of his stories straight.That said, I am very grateful that Mr Martinelli (who has since passed away) chose to compile these thoughts. In my research of the development of Cincinnati's Walnut Hills community, his work is invaluable for insight into the Little Italy community. Even though some of his stories are likely embellished, he vividly describes the locations of local establishments which have all been forgotten.So the four stars here are not a reflection of the book itself, but for the inadvertent resource that Martinelli left those trying to identify this historical community."
4,27 moves in this short form,"Ho'o shows 9 classic chinese exercises, which are pretty good in themselves. Ho'o then shows 27 essential forms of Tai chi chuan. The pictures and discriptions aren't bad, but if you've never seen the movements, you may want to consider the video by the same author as well. Pushing hands is briefly discussed, and self defense possibilities are shown for a lot of the moves. All in all, a tidy little book to get one started in Tai chi."
3,Dated Book relying on old statistics?,"Questionable statistics?: 13% of a crop destroyed is quoted, when the actual figures were probably much higher--some say 90% of a crop rotted. Who is to say? This is why nobody will ever definitively write the economic history of the USSR. At best educated guesses. But the author tries.However, an economic history as opposed to a political history is for the USSR a distorted picture of what happened, because of the bad data problem mentioned above. Hence the three stars."
5,Victor Herman -- Gulag survivor,"I made Mr. Herman's acquaintance after his return to the US. This book, which was made into a poor CBS-TV movie, is perhaps the single most moving account of an American's life in Soviet Russia under Stalin. It is truly remarkable that a human being could survive even 10% of the prison and gulag experiences he suffered. This story is truly unforgettable!"
5,A Lesson for the Present,"Mr. Herman's story is everything that the other reviewers say it is. I want to add, however, that his book illustrates why we have something precious and worth protecting in this country. I believe Mr. Herman would not have wanted to preach to us about that, but that he wanted to let us know that freedom is worth fighting for. One does not have to be the super-patriot type to realize that our system, with all its flaws and distortions, offers people more than any other in history. Those of us who automatically assume the worst and always denigrate the U.S. do themselves an enormous disservice. One has only to read about what was done to Mr. Herman, legally in the USSR at that time, to understand this. I have been (and remain) fairly liberal in my political orientation, but this book has changed a fundamental attitude within my being. It's not an easy story to experience, but open yourself to it and you will gain a great deal!"
4,Cycle Flag mount,"I've had this Flag Mount on my bike for a couple of months and am fairly satisfied. It fit my 1/2"" trunk luggage rack quite well and sinched down nicely. Riding in the heavy Oklahoma winds has been no problem as the mount stays firmly in place and doesn't slip or pivot at all.The Flag itself on the other hand is not a quality flag. The stitches started coming apart within 500 miles of use and by the time I hit 1000 miles it was toast and needed to be replaced. I put about 18,000 miles a year on my bike so I need good quality flags.Also, it has a spring loade pin to keep it from folding down unwantingly and it had a tendancy to stick once in a while at first but seems fine now.The mount itself is a good quality unit but the flag was cheaply made so i would recommend buying a quality flag when you buy this mount."
4,Fairly Iluminating,"I read this textbook with an introductory computer science class and I found it fairly useful. The text is clear and concise when describing abstract concepts. There are also helpful pictures and diagrams that help enhance comprehension. The exercises in the back of the chapter are not impossible and help cement the information in one's mind. Finally, the summaries at the end of the chapter help with understanding.The book is not without its flaws. The book really fails to describe the mathematical side of computer science clearly. It seems to be satisfied with throwing an example on the page as an ""explanation."" Other than that, it is a good book for those who are new to computer science."
2,This passes for a college text book?,"I am currently using this book in college, and I find so many errors and inconsistencies, it drives me nuts.I write reviews for textbooks regularly so I realize I have a different perspective then an 18yo thinking the teacher and the book are ""all knowing""; but I am surprised that teachers pick this book, or at least don't account for the poorly written text.Often, if I want to understand what the text is talking about, I go to Wikipedia, or a computer forum, and find out what the book was trying to explain.I imagine if I were a computer savvy person, the book would not bother me, but being that it is considered a beginning computer book, and an intro to computer science, I find that it aggravates me more the educates me."
4,Computer science,"Great Product, although its exercises are confusing and contain mistakes.The content is educational and interesting.It would be helpful if next editions contain answers or similar solutions are provided, in order to avoid errors and misunderstandings.A website with help would be great too."
4,A Valuable Guide to Computer Basics,"Computer Science Illuminated is an easy to understand, educational guide to computer fundamentals. Basic computer skills are presented through seventeen detailed chapters. Key terms are in bold for easy identification, with clear definitions in the margins. Pictures, charts, and diagrams are illustrated for further clarification and understanding of ideas.I found this book to be an excellent source. It taught me valuable basic computer skills in an easy, clear manner. Some chapters appeared to be quite long and wordy, but it was all out of good intentions. Any repetition was to further enhance ideas and make them clear to make sure that they were learned. With the completion of this book, you will be able to understand and utilize the computer concepts you have learned. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning computer science fundamentals through an easy, understandable guide."
3,Great deal,"I was really impressed by the price of this textbook that originally would have cost more than 2 times more at the school book store. The book has a bit of wear and tear, but nothing was missing!"
3,Computer Science Illuminated,"I have used this book for an introduction to computer science course. It has proved to be adequate but not extraordinary. I have learned some important concepts and terms, and the simple, spaced out language is easy to read. However, more detail and inclusion of more complex terms would have made the textbook a lot better. It would not be sufficient for a higher level computer class, but has allowed me to do above average in a basic computing class."
3,Computer Science Illuminated,"Coming from the perspective of a college freshman currently studying from this book, I would say that Dale and Lewis did a satisfactory job with this Illuminated textbook. The graphs and charts are for the most part easy to read and comprehend, and the information is helpful for my computer science course. The questions at the end of the chapter are very helpful in identifying key concepts, with the glossary and the index as additonal tools for understanding.One thing that the authors could have done better with this book is making it clearer to understanding. While those charts may be simple, the facts about computer and network systems are something that I feel is over my head. With having very little knowledge about this type of computer systems, I was unsure of the meaning of certain terms and components of the machine. Pretty well written, helpful when paired with a computer science course."
3,Computer Science Illuminated,"This text, Computer Science Illuminated, attempts to provide students with an overview of the basics in computer science. The book is complete with long detailed chapters broken into sections, followed by chapter review questions. The book certainly provides students with the chance to be introduced to a wide variety of topics dealing with computer science.In my opinion, the downside to this textbook is that it may be too complex for an intro level course. So much is put into one chapter that I often felt that I was bouncing around and not quite clear with everything that I had read. Although the chapter review questions helped, because they focused in on certain points that I was then able to go back to and explore, I felt like I was not getting a full understanding of everything in the chapter."
5,Top 10 CD's of 2008,"I bought this cd several months ago and haven't stopped listening to it.Every week it's in my player. Metal cds haven't been plentiful lately. This cd has Kate French (Chastain Vocalist) as lead singer and Corbin King on guitar.It is the best cd I've heard in a while. It's just straight Heavy Metal right in your teeth. The vocals and guitar work are really great. This isn't second rate Metal. I totally recommend it. Metal Rules gives it a 5 Star rating. Absolutely right. You won't regret buying this. There is a lot of garbage Metal cds out there,it's nice to see a great cd come along."
3,Too Disturbing to Finish!,"I am a huge fan of Gloria Naylor's and was very excited to read her latest work, although the subject matter didn't seem to fall in line with her other fantastic novels. And boy, was this one different! It disturbed me so much that I couldn't make it to the end. It blew my mind on how a relatively small incident escalated totally out of control. Even if it was a fictionalized memoir, I couldn't imagine going through a fraction of what she did. I also kept on thinking, are our tax dollars really spent on this kind of b.s?? I hope that her next novel has nothing to do with this sort of torture. Bring Mama Day back, please!"
3,Scary Implications,"This is, by Naylor's own admission, a highly fictionalized account of her life during that year. She admits what happened can made readers think she had a nervous breakdown or that she's a target of harassment by the National Security Administration. COINTEL and the Bush Adminstration provide examples of the government spying on ordinary citizens but this can't explain Naylor's Anti Semitic remarks or her going into details about the head of the NSA, Dick Smith's sexual habits.It's an intriguing work and will inspire many foes and allies but I think most people will be like me, wondering just what to believe."
5,Enormous respect for Ms. Naylor,"I anxiously await the release of Gloria Naylor's new book ""1996"" and applaud her for the courage it took to address an issue that profoundly impacts the lives of so many people in our world but is still considered a politically-incorrect topic of discussion. Personal accounts of electronic harassment and terrorist stalking are not only discounted but blatantly ""discouraged"" even though evidence and legislation clearly acknowledge their existence. Hopefully, after reading this book, many understandably hesitant individuals will find the strength to come forward and say ""hey, as weird as it seems, this sounds like MY life!"" and unite to find a solution."
3,Pirated CD!,"Dave Mallett albums are always good, and this one (recorded at the height of his Nashville years) is no exception.However, buyer beware - this appears to be a pirated version of the original. The font for the title has been altered from the original - the word ""a"" is now a pair of cartoonish eyes and ""lifetime"" looks like ""lifetute"". The CD jacket is clearly duplicated on a cheap color printer.Since Flying Fish/Rounder Records is now no longer producing this title, this may be the only way to get this fine music. Collect if you must, but consider what you're getting and the likelihood that the artist may not see a penny in royalties from your purchase."
2,A big disappointment,"I really did expect more from Ghirardelli. I am an extremely experienced baker and I do all the baking every day for my café, but few of these recipes worked. A better bet would be Maida Heatter's Chocolate, or Nick Malgieri's."
3,"Good, But Not Definitive","The recipes contained on the inside of the wrapping on a Ghiradelli chocolate cooking bar are fantastic. The recipes in this book don't quite live up to the free recipes. Many of the recipes in this book are good; others make one wonder, ""what's all the fuss about?"" I agree with what several other reviewers have said, that if you want the definitive chocolate cookbook, this isn't it."
3,It worked,"It took 6 weeks for this to work for me. I didn't have any side effects at all. Try just black cohosh first though, it's cheaper."
2,Not recommended,"The sound from these headphones is decent but the cords tend to tangle. Also, after a few months the plastic that covers the wires started ripping and the wires became exposed. I highly recommend that you do not buy these."
1,NOT GODD,I bought these headphones to take the place of my Ipod buds. They were great in the begining but then the over the ear pice fell off. Bummer. I cannot recomend them
1,Don't Buy!!!,"I bought these headphones and in the beginning they were great except the cords were very tangle prone. Well after less than 3 months the black rubbery material that covers the wires just tore and exposed the wires. Then they started making a weird noise and I called Sony because they are still under warranty, but they don't want to honor the warranty and they want me to either pay $16 for refurbished ones or possibly $58 to fix them. Yeah right on both accounts."
2,ouch!!!,"1. pretty2. good sound quality3. good if you sit quietly at your computer and don't move your head.4. if you move your head at all, bend over, go for a walk, etc. the bud will swing away from your ear and possibly fall off. not good."
4,good phones for a great price,"I bought these as a replacement for a pair I broke recently. It was totally my fault. I accidentally stepped on one. I can not keep a pair of regular buds in my ears and I don't like the feeling of inner ear phones. These are extremely comfortable, and sound pretty darn good with my Sansa Clip."
3,"Good sound quality, but things fall apart.","When I first bought these, I liked them very much. They sound quality for ear buds were good (better than the headphones that came with my Ipod). They stayed in my ear pretty well, even when I was exercising. The upside on the sound is that they have good bass frequency response for the price, and they are very loud (at least compared to the ipod headphones).Their biggest problem is that they fell apart over the space of about 12 months. First the rubber clips broke off, then the wire slowly started rubbing off.If Sony had shipped them with some kind of protective case that you could put in your pocket, they would have lasted a lot longer. Ironically, the old cheap sony earbuds I have are still in perfect working order, while these (which cost almost $30) are deteriorated past the point of uselessness."
2,Sony MDR-J20,"I purchased the MDR-J20's to replace my iPod headphones during my workouts. The MDR-J20's are comfortable enough, however the sound is not nearly as good as the iPod headphones. The sound wasn't as rich as the iPod's. When I played some jazz music, the sounds was OK for my workouts but when I played my up-tempo workout music, the sound hurt my ears after just a couple of minutes. I can not recommend these headphones."
2,Not a good quality sound and not a very comfortable feet,Not a good quality sound and not a very comfortable feet
1,Sony MDR-J20 Vertical In-Ear Headphones no good,"Its a shame i didn't see these reviews before buying these. The new flexible ear-hooks are too flexible and short, meaning the phones slip off the ear; the decision to join the phono lead to the left earpiece rather than traditionally via a 'U' arrangement (like a stethoscope)makes this worse on the left. And the earpieces are too weighty and large, compounding all the above. My old J10's were far better than these. Shame on you sony, for rusing these poorly designed headphones out."
5,My girlfriend LOVED IT!,"Really Soft, Realistic looking, and Super cute expression!My girlfriend just absolutely loved it. Best stuffed whitetiger you can buy!"
5,Wonderful! So soft!,"I ordered this for my 8 year old who has a FAO Schwartz tiger that has been loved to death. She wanted a realistic soft tigher like her FAO tiger, but white. I was pleased to find this was a soft toy. Some are so stuffed they have no flexability. This is not so flimsey that it's floppy, but holds it's shape well and still soft enought to snuggle and play with. I was also suprised by the size. The tiger is infact 30 inches, but also sits quite high. Very pleased with item. I'm hoping it will hold up well against lots of snuggles and play. Havent had it long enought to be able to rate durability yet."
5,Good job,What matters most to a consumer like me is when i order somethig that i get what i hoped for and in a timely fashion.........to my delight i got both of those things and i reccommend this store to anyone looking for similar items.
1,For Sellers Completists Only,"Directed by Peter Medak and co-written by Spike Milligan, ""Ghost in the Noonday Sun"" (1973) marked the nadir of Peter Sellers' career - a disastrous, unfinished pirate comedy that Columbia buried in a London vault. Ten years later, the film was resurrected on home video for curious Sellers fans. Still incomplete and remarkably unfunny, Columbia did the participants a huge favor by shelving this troubled production. You're better off listening to ""The Goon Show."""
4,Music as good as the Union,"The album has been on my CD player for the last two days. I have had no desire to listen to anything else. The music comes from an age when Unions changed things, and make you feel it could happen again"
5,The music of the Wobblies,"Music has a special place in labor history, the Internationale, Joe Hill, and the Union Made. It's especially important for the IWW which seems full of songs, both of protest and of triumph. This is a CD that reminds us of the history of the labor movement in America, and highlights the special role of the IWW in that history."
5,Thoroughly enjoyable AND scholarly: quite an accomplishment!,"Graham Robb is one of that rare breed of scholars, who write what they want to, unfettered by institutional constraints, and write to an intelligent, literate audience that genuinely wants to learn. Much of Victor's Hugo's work is inaccessable to the English language audience. Robb's presentation and interpretation of many different aspects of his literary career show how much he enjoyed the Hugo's work, and his enthusiasm excited this reader. He did a masterful job of integrating history, the stange personal life of Hugo, and his massive literary output. This will become a classic source of information about Victor Hugo."
2,"Well-researched, and yet...","Well-researched biography, maybe; however, I found Robb's patronizing tone towards his subject to be distasteful, offensive. A more objective account--without a lurking sneer behind it--is in order."
5,CHANGE GETTER!,Giant Robot action at it's finest. Return to a day when robot's could trash an opponent simply because the Hero was determined not to lose.Getter Robo harkens back to those days. Truly worthy a look by any Giant Robot fan.
3,The double sticking 's' is a pain in the asss. (see what I mean!),"Everything works fine except that the 's' key almost consstantly sstickss and makess for a miserable keyboard experience. (Thiss is an actual, unedited example). I've tried numerous ways to try and un-stick the 'ss' key, but unless your word processor has a good Spelling Correction feature, you're in for a treat! Do I think that this is a common glitch, 'no' but it still shouldn't happen at all.(My Apple iWork '09 Pages and Microsoft Office for Mac '08 Word software both do a fairly good job of catching the errorss. Which, if I had used either for thiss review, then they wouldn't have probably allowed thiss demonstration to be so obvious!)"
5,CRISP,"I am always looking for CRISP percale sheets like they used to make. These are perfect, but don't get them if you like very soft sheets."
1,"Useless, do not buy this book.",Out of the twenty-five pages eight are acknowledgements and bibliography. Then the first page that does relate to the topic is half blank. Thought the document is padded with over large pictures of disco dancers and hitchhikers. After a brief summary and character sketch it begins to give background on the 70's in America. The book is British so this has little or no value. This document ends with six pages of reviews of which only one is specifically about hitchhikers guide. At the end there is a page advertising their other products. What little useful information this contains is not only buried under pages of crap but also not entirely accurate. Save you money and time don't bother with this.
4,Ahead of its Time,"I purchased this album shortly after it came out and it was a bit much to soak in initially. I was in college studying music and really into synths and I got an earful on this album. In addition this album predates Headhunters in which Herbie combines synths with the funk. Most of my friends couldn't dig Crossings because Herbie was searching and the grooves, timbres, moods and tempos constantly shifted. This album required serious listening. I recently gave it a listen and I re-discovered compositions and sounds of incredible beauty. My favorite tune is Quasar. It is strange how this tune sounds like it could be used in someone's SciFi space thriller today and it would still sound futuristic. Awesome!"
1,Don't waste your money,"OK, If you do want to waste your money, you will find a few entries that are a bit funny, but they are few and far between. For the most part this screwed-up dictionary has nothing going for it. It seems like this guy pulled most of the definition right out of his [expletive deleted by author]. Of course, with the title it has, it quickly made its way around this company made of geeks. General consensus was, why did I buy that????? On average, MIT Press does a decent job of producing good books, but they missed the boat on this one. Must have been because of Kelly-Bootle's status in the computer culture. If you want a good dictionary that is also a hilarious read, pick up the New Hackers Dictionary, or just look around for the Jargon file out there on the net"
4,Not Your Traditional King's Quest Game,"If you're expecting another King's Quest game in the similar style and method of KQ1-7, you're in for a shock on this one. The object of the game is exploring, which is fun, but also involves a lot of Wolfenstein-style shoot-to-kill. It really has little to do with King's Quest in the true Sierra tradition. It's a modern kill-fest set in Daventry.If you're a true, die-hard fan of the King's Quest series, like I am, you'll buy it to have it. I found it most helpful to play with cheats on (you can find them on the web at a variety of sites) because I am not a true shoot-and-kill type of game player. It allowed me to explore and enjoy the few adventure-game aspects of this game. For those who enjoyed Quest for Glory, it does mimic that series in some small ways.Mostly, alas, this is Wolfenstein in Daventry. True adventure games in the style of Sierra's Golden Years in the 1980's-1990's are truly a thing of the past."
1,Nowhere Near King's Quest,"I understand Sierra felt the need to venture into the 3d action part of gaming, but they didn't have to soil the noble King's Quest series in order to break into the market. It was a stupid trick to pull, I am glad that when I purchased this game it was only for 10 bucks in a bargain bin. I played the whole game through, and was thoroughly disappointed at each step. After running into an annoying bug on an old computer of mine after finally reaching close to the end, I replayed it again on a new computer more recently, and was annoyed to see the disappointing and short ending. They didn't even have the decency to put in a nice, long, conclusive ending like other King's Quest games. And the excess violence and poor excuses for puzzles are a disgrace. If you should buy this game, please do not mistake it for a true King's Quest, it is only a mockery. And play the other seven *real* King's Quest games instead."
5,really is a classic,"This game was so much fun to play. I played it a good year or two before deciding to sell it. I was surprised at the great quality of the graphics considering when this game was made. Also, this game doesn't require very high computer specifications, so pretty much any computer can run this game, including my old compaq. What is better than the graphics is the game play. The worlds are HUGE, and there's just so much to explore, many unique creatures as well as items. The story line is very complex, and sometimes online walkthroughs can be handy to get through the quests. It's basically like you're a real person in the game, you really get pulled into it.The only downfall is that the story doesn't exactly remind me of a ""king's quest"" game; maybe a different title would serve it better. Anywho, if you enjoy RPG's like the diablo series, WoW, or Nox, you will love this game. I'm surprised more people don't know about it. Many hours of great game play."
4,Mom's point of view,"My experience with this game is a love/hate thing. I had no experieience with shoot em kill em/ arcade type games and had to master shooting and jumping skills. Then, trying to find all the stuff - some in obscure places- without any cheats as we were not online and the cheat book was non existant - made me quit the game numerous times. I did finally get through it and have played it many times since. The real fun of this game was playing it with my child - we spent many happy hours trying to get to the next level and see the new realm. The graphics are so-so cartoonish and Graham is sort of dorky in a good way. We especially liked knocking him into things to hear him groan and have him belch. This is a cute game - nothing sophisticated or high tech. I think it's good for younger children, provided they have a walk through, otherwise they might get a little frustrated. It's a fun game and I highly recommend playing it, especially if you have a child to play it with!"
3,A very mixed uneven game.,"This game is the last Kings Quest game to ever be released and it recieved alot of bad reviews from game fans.This game has both ups and downs.Ups - Great Graphics! stunning Nintendo 64 quality graphics.- Alot of fun action in the game with alot of violence and enemies to kill.- A new take up the realm of daventry.Downs - Really has no relation to the royal family at all.- Dosen't seem like a Kings Quest adventure game at all either.- It appears that this game has really no story thats any good to speak of.- The fighting isnt really a Kings Quest style game.So all in all its a very fun game, and a very good game for what's inside of it.But its a terrible Kings Quest game."
2,Disappointing sequel,"I grew up on King's Quest. My parents were playing King's Quest I when I was in the womb, and every time a new King's Quest came out they would play it. When I was very little, it was exciting to watch them play the games. As I got older, I would be very eager to help them solve some of the puzzles. By the time King's Quest VII came out, I could practically play on my own and it was such an amazing experience to explore the lands, meet characters, and solve problems with all of the items in your inventory. I learned a lot about mythology and fairy tale lore. I had very high expectations for King's Quest VIII. It was to be the first of the series I could play entirely on my own, without my parents' help. I anxiously awaited its release. Only to discover it had turned into a hack-and-slash game. I couldn't bring myself to play past the first level."
2,Not what I expected,"Having followed the King's Quest games as they were appearing late 80's/early 90's, I have become a huge fan. The fact that the games did not fall into the fantasy cliche of the dark sword and sorcery junk that floods the market made the games truly a treasure. However, as others have noted, King's Quest 8 was a step in a different direction. They move away from the Royal Family (a mistake in my mind; why should we care for these characters, having only seen a short introduction?). The entire game feels like a fantastical version of Doom. Gone are the witty remarks and likeable characters... everything that Conner says is hugely (over)dramatic, that is when he is not being attacked by punch-throwing mummies (??) or some other hybrid monster. In closing, I would much rather have the early two-dimensional adventures of Graham than the sophisticated graphics of Mask of Eternity.I'm editing this to give it two stars. I was feeling far too generous when I first wrote this."
3,brain damage and the master,This movie was good. It had a good story line but the fight scenes were too short. The master was a great fighter but his student had more guts and heart to try and stop the damage being done by the affects of the opium to the town. The master never thought he would get caught up oh!!!!!!!!!!!but he did. The fight scenes should have been a little longer but they were excellent enough. I thought this was a good overall.
1,Jaw-droppingly bad,"My husband and I teach swing locally and I picked this tape up at the library for move ideas. I was aghast at what I saw. Please do not waste your time learning Cal Poza's style unless you are restricting your dancing to ballroom-style. It's so far removed from what we dance at swing dances that it would be hard for you to integrate it. If you are really interested in learning how to swing dance, check out many of the other tapes available such as Julie Mertz"
2,Cheesy,"I suppose this will teach you the steps but it is defintely not very hip. The format is cheesy, the dancers stiff and old-fashioned. Not the instruction I had in mind for swing dancing at the local clubs. But like I said it show what steps are involved so if you want conservative or know how to take what it shows and liven it up, this would be ok."
1,Craptacular,"Never buy any DVD by Cal Pozo. I've accidentally bought two, since Cal isn't on the cover and I hadn't noticed that he would be the one doing the instruction. By the way, the cover of the DVD looks like it's a lot more lively than it actually is.This is extremely stiff, and you will not be impressing anyone with your moves. Honestly, this looked horrible and my entire family was laughing hysterically for the first ten minutes because we could not believe that anything could be so boring, stilted, and lame. After that we fell asleep. Please, save your money."
1,Try Something Else!!!,"This instructional 'SWING Dance' video is horrible, unless you are going to a ballroom party. Any swing club would laugh you off the floor if you tried to emulate Cal Pozo. And it will basically teach you nothing in a few minutes, without much michanics, an awful-not to mention innacurate-style, and a waste of $15 (avg). Try something from the 'World of Swing' collection or go to your local dance sites for lists of at home videos you can purchase here at Amazon."
1,Boring,"There is very little in this video at all, it is very slow paced and doesn't do much other than teach the basic step, if you are looking for something to really learn from, especially if you have already learned the basic step look for a different video. The cover is misleading, don't buy this video."
3,traditional swing not Lindy Hop,Cal has produed a Swing video that is better for older people.It is very basic & traditional.I agree it is better for a ballroom crowd but is still can be used in a Swing party.
2,craptacular concur,"I am no swing expert and bought this tape based on the hip fun looking couple on the box cover. The actual footage is a trip through the Lawrence Welk era. The lady, (she could potentially look quite hip in an appropriate outfit) wears this hideous flamingo pink flapper fringe sheath costume with this 6 foot strand of beads..reminiscent of those from the early 1980's (shudder)..Yes the 'swing' dancing on this tape resembles the geriatric gig, at best. They contradict entirely what their box label promises to deliver! I'll tell you, after this ill informed purchase, I will look at the names instead of the pictures from now on!A far better, more honestly packaged production is Swing Craze. They offer a better basic as well as a fun history lesson on Swing."
3,Kinda Sucks But OK for Beginners,"Reviewers here are a little bit harsh on old Cal here. Yes, it's really corny and cheesy and everyone is so stiff, they can be cardboard cutouts. But for the beginner, this is not all that bad. It does teach you basics and it reviews every move very thoroughly. It is a bit of a waste of tape if you ask me because I can always press rewind, but still, an effective learning tool. I am intermediate and I'm still able to salvage some cool moves toward later end of tape and during closing demo and closing credits when his students are dancing."
1,horrible,"I ordered it on years ago, then I took a look recently, I cannot see nothing, because I cannot open it, I will never buy leard dance DVD, if I real want I will try VHS."
2,Reese's Butter Cup Action!,"I was sad watching the film ""Forbidden Fruits"" in which Arab Americans and African Americans were fighting with each other tooth and nail. It was fun watching ""100% Arabica"" in which French Blacks and French Arabs seemed to mix and mingle just fine. In this doc, Samuel, a Black guy, works out with his Arab buddies in the weight room. In ""The Best of Francois Sagat Part One,"" Lebanese Francois and Turkish Huessein get busy with a ebony-chocolate brotha and it rocks! This is like a G-rated version of that. If you like black-and-brown mixing, then this is for you!Like most muscleman videos, this is all training and very little dialogue. The red envelope said Silvio speaks of ton of languages and has an engineering degree. Although he epitomizes ""All that and brains too,"" you don't get to hear him discuss his skills. He does pose in his speedoes at least once and some viewers may just want to fastforward to that seen."
5,This knife is outstanding,"I can't say enough about this knife. My wife bought me one over 30 years ago I loaned it to my son to go fishing, should Isay my adult son. Some how he either lost it or misplaced it in any case it is gone and can't be found. I needed to buy a new knife if I expected to have one on me when I go hunting this year so I bought the same knife. I love this knife but the other had sentimental value and I hope it shows up one day.Buck 110 Folding Hunter, Lockback Folding Knife"
5,Great knife for $,I field dressed & skinned two deers with this knife this fall. The knife held a sharp blade overall. It has a robust blade that withstands heavy work like cutting thru leg joints and sharp enough to skin hides easily. Glad I bought it. Also not so expensive that if I lost it I would feel terrible... just get another one.
4,Blade is great! Sheath was wrong...,"The blade its self is fantastic! Be warned though... the sheath that I got with my purchase was of a wrong size... the blade could barely fit into it's place and even after severely stretching the leather on the sheath the flap just could not close over the end of the blade.Overall not a huge deal - I made the purchase for the blade not the sheath, but it does make me feel like I purchase something cheap..."
5,Good to get a good knife from a highly respected knife maker,"I bought 3 knives to give as gifts. I am happy to have high quality items like this to give for Christmas, and especially happy that the advertised two-day shipping actually made it to me in 2 days. Good work, Amazon! After giving these as gifts, got to hold one of the knives. It feels completely comfortable, a nice heft, good weight, feels substantial; and the edge is super sharp...handle with care!"
5,A Damn Good Knife,This Knife looks and feels great. Blade is very sharp from the factory. This is a quality knife that's made it the USA
5,Good buck knife and good price,I got this knife for $24.99 on Amazon.com.This was the lowest price I have seen so far. It sells for $34.99 at your local Walmart. Leather sheath is included with the knife. Nylon sheath is included with the same knife from Walmart. Leather is better than Nylon. The blade is sharp when first opened from packaging. 4.75-inch long handle is good enough for a big hand. This Buck knife is made in USA.Recommend everyone to buy from Amazon.
5,"Great knife, great price","I love this large pocket knife, which I use regularly in my daily activities and on geology trips. It has held up nicely and is still sharp after heavy abuse.Pros:- So extremely sharp that it can just slice through paper- Comes with a very nice leather sheath- Very sturdy/well-made and will last a long time- Can't beat this price - in local stores it is $20 higherCons:- Possibly a bit large for some people (if it is, there is a smaller model)Overall, it is large but I love its versatility and never leave the house without it. A great buy at under $30."
4,110 buck knife,"When i was a kid i found my dad's buck knife in a drawer in the house somewhere and i thought it was the coolest knife. I always wanted one just like it but never went and bought one. It was a good knife in the sixties, and it's an even better knife now."
3,Nice Knife...but!,"Buck 110 Folding Hunter, Lockback Folding KnifeReceived my Buck 110 Folding Knife in the mail today. My first real beautiful looking ""Man Knife."" Sharp edge with leather sheath. ""Amazing, Amazon"" free shipping-fast delivery. The last pocket knife I owned was an Electrian pocket wire stripper. And that was over 20 years ago.One problem that I have is with the knife lock...I unfolded the knife but had a very diffucult time with the ""Lockback"" folding the knife back. I had to use a pair of pliers (with a cloth) to unlock the mechanism. That is not cool. I don't want to sound like a Wuss but is there a break in time/period where as the lock mechanism will eventually be easier to disengage the knife, or do I have to sort of excercise the lock mechanism until it does? I would appreciate some feedback on the ""Lock"" mechanism."
5,A classic,"Pretty much the same as when they first came out back in the 60's. Sure it has it faults--it is heavy and the tip of the blade is thin enough to break. And like all stainless steel as compared to 1095 or CV, it is a pain to sharpen. But it must be doing something right to have been a best seller for over 40 years---and for spawning a host of imitators."
5,Hard not to love,"Not much new to say that many others have not already. The look, the size, the heft, the utility, and the edge are all just perfect. Buck makes a great quality blade that shaved hair off the back of my forearm right out of the box, and better after a touchup on a fine water stone. Now, in terms of functionality, this isn't a one handed opener with a low edge angle and an ultra lightweight handle. It is a tank of a knife with lots of brass and smooth polished wood. The blade is easy to sharpen, and has a less acute angle on it that will take some abuse and still maintain a good functional edge. Personally, I don't find it too big to sit in my pocket, but clearly some prefer it in the nice leather holster it comes with. It opens fairly easily,and the pressure needed to unlock the blade and close it is a bit much for my 10 year old daughter, but I don't intend to pass it on to her for at least a few more years anyway. All in all, a great value in a classic blade."
5,Everything a classic should be,"I've owned (and lost) many 'plastic' knifes over the years. All were worth the money. None has the classic beauty of this Buck. I opened the box while sitting on the porch with my wife who commented, 'My dad had one just like that -- nice.' It is really well made, and sharp right out of the box. Mine came with a well fitting leather (read quiet) sheath which should help me not lose it."
5,Best lockblade knife around!,"I bought this for one for one of my sons. I have owned this same knife for years and it still holds an edge better than any knife I own. I saw the same knife in a store but noticed the sheath was canvas not leather and it was priced even more than this one. Over the years I have owned many more expensive hunting folders but for over all use, this one is my favorite. I believe my original knife is about 20 years old now and I still carry it on all my hunting trips."
3,unable to fold back even with both hand :(,"I love the look of the knife and it's a sharp one. However, the knife is easy to unfolded but I cannot fold it back. I use even both of my hands but it doesn't help. Don't know what to do."
4,Good Knife but pretty heavy,"It's a great knife and very well made but if you want a pocket knife to actually go in your pocket you might want to get something a little smaller. It comes with a belt mounted case but who really wants to wear this huge thing on their belt like a fanny pack,,not me I have too much self respect. Great knife just too heavy and too big."
3,Tough to open/close,"It's pretty stiff/hard to open & close, the mechanism is a push button -- but it is not easy to do one-handed or even two-handed.Great blade and sharpness."
3,Good deal,"Very prompt shipping and the deal was good on the knife they should have added that the sheath was included. I bought a sheath that I now don't need. Also do not add teh sheath as a ""frequently bought together"" when it is not needed. It leads people to believe that they need to buy it!"
4,Pride!,"Gotta say I bought this knife more just because I wanted it. Not sure how much I will actually use it. Only drawback to this knife is it is a heavy folder compared to others out there. That being said this knife is awesome. Came razor sharp, feels nice and sturdy. Its no wonder this design has been around as long as it has. Made in the USA does not come cheap, but this knife delivers, and its history makes it cool. I like the leather sheath that came with it as well, it fits prefect with the old school look."
5,bang for your BUCK <--get it.,"I can't say that I know much about knives, But the Buck 110 Folding Hunter seems like a great one. It feels great in the hand, and when you open it, you know you can use it with confidence. Everyone says the Buck knife is an American Classic, and well now I can see why. I have only used it a few times, but every time that I have it has served its purpose. The knife comes razor sharp right out of the box (as it should) and has remained sharp thus far. I cannot imagine it will be hard to sharpen, but only time will tell. As most people have said, this knife does have some weight on it, but in my opinion, its a small price to pay the quality of the knife. I recommend either keeping it in the holster, or close to you, if not it will swing around in a loose pocket, becoming irritating after a while."
5,just what he wanted,"I bought this for my best guy. He had lost his years ago, and said he was very happy to have this model again. He's never without it."
5,"sharp, handy durable","classic knife. Purchased an aftermarket quick draw sheath. It's money! slick, feels good in your hand, and super sharp! Buck also has an unconditional life time warranty. Best price for this knife was on Amazon."
5,Great American made product,"Nice finish, sharp, great knife for everyday tasks and hunting. I would highly recommend this knife. Sturdy and solid tool."
2,Buck needs to pay more attention to quality,"The first knife I received had a big dent on the edge and would not fit at all in the sheath provided. I had to send it back to Amazon and asked for a replacement.The second knife seemed to be good but still would not fit in the sheath as it should. It fit very tightly and I had to stretch it out using a hot blow dryer and the handle end of a screw driver. I expect more from a company who claims that each knife reflects the integrity of the management.If you take the name BUCK and replace the first letter with an ""F"" you'll have my exact thoughts."
2,"6 months, already not working!!","I loved this camera at first and have only had it 6 months. Great pictures, so easy to use, nice video feature, etc. But here it is 6 months later, it's jammed, frozen, won't work and it's the holidays. I have to send it in to be fixed with no clue when I'll get it back. I've baby'd this thing and am never rough on it nor have gotten it moist, wet, anything. NOT IMPRESSED!"
1,Expensive Disposable - below average pictures.,"When the camera was first released, many customers experienced a problem in which the camera would freeze periodically and the only way to regain control would be to remove the battery and power cycle. Another more recent problem consumers are experiencing now is cracking the fragile LCD screen on this device. It's roughly as durable as an eggshell. Once the LCD is broken you cannot use this camera. Don't be tempted to buy a used one without the LCD... it's useless. Lastly, when the camera is working properly, it does not perform nearly as well as other cameras in its 2007 class - there are many cameras that produce better pictures at lower retail prices. When I presented a working version of this camera to many friends and family I COULD NOT TRADE OR EVEN GIVE IT AWAY for FREE. My friends and relatives liked their Fujitsu, Nikon or Canon ALOT better. Don't give into the temptation to pick up this inexpensive 8MP camera; you WILL be dissapointed."
3,Thank you to everyone who posted,"Thank you for everyone who posted a review. I was just outside taking pictures (it is freezing out)... and the camera just froze up. I quickly became annoyed, came inside and googled ""problems"" on this type of camera. To my surprise, this is apparently a common problem that it freezes when you are in a cold place???. After reading one of the posts, I took the battery out and put it back in and was able to actually shut the camera off!Thank you everyone!"
3,Battery Problems,"If you take the camera outside in cold weather,(very short time) you won't be able to shoot. Battery won't operate. Go back inside, take battery out and reinstall, the camera works again."
4,v803,Great camera. Takes wonderful daytime pictures. At night they aren't as good and are a little fuzzy. Overall it is a great purchase.
1,Disappointing,"I have used Kodak cameras before and expected much better from this one.I have been having problems with the camera's shutter for months. After sending it to be repaired once, the camera would sometimes make a grinding noise and fail to turn on. It would often take several times to get the camera to power up, and I would sometimes miss picture opportunities.The camera was sent in to fix the powering on problem, and the problem has come back again.I would recommend saving a lot of time and postage and getting something else. This camera is a frustrating piece of junk--instead of capturing good moments, I've ended up being upset because my stupid camera still doesn't work."
5,best gift ever,"this is the best gift i could have ever given to my teenage daughter, she will not leave home without it. this camera has seen more use than anything i have ever bought. not a single problem with the camera or software, itstalled with vista"
1,Having Trouble,"I bought this camera - Kodak EasyShare V803 8MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (Mystic Purple) for my neice as a birthday present. The good part is it worked on her birthday. The bad news is that it hasn't worked since. Her mother has been trying to contact the supplier to return it for over three weeks. They've been closed for the holiday(?). So, I'm not happy with this purchase at all and will not buy any other electronic items from Amazon or their vendors. I will have Amex involved in this by this coming Monday, if the problem is not resolved. Amazon's good for books and anything without moving parts and that's about it."
2,Short lived LCD screen,Great while it worked. Had it a few months. My wife carried it in her purse. Pulled it out to take a pic and the LCD screen was broken beneath the outer layer. Found many postings online of similar results. Not covered under warranty. Not recommended.
1,Returned it after 15 minutes....,"Boy was I wrong to pick up this Kodak camera! Though the blue coloring and random ""positive"" reviews did persuade me to purchase, it was not worth thea) grainy screen quality,b) grinding noise when a picture was taken,c) slow processing after a picture was taken,d) slow review button,e) ill-located (favorite, scene and camera)buttons which need to be pressed really hard and with a fingernail above the very fragile screen andf) poor camera body craftmanship. The color of the body could be scratched off with a fingernail, as well.I know I only had it for at the most, 30 minutes... but I did not want to deal with a longer period of time with possible occuring problems with this camera.Thanks anyways, Kodak....I bought my Sony instead!"
3,Nice product but...,"Used the camera for about 15 days before it actually failed. Although it appears esthetic in both shape and color, it must be quite fragile.Positives...it took nice very clear pictures. It was fast and the screen was large enough to review easily. When it worked I really felt it was a good value.Not So positive. The camera quit while I was taking pictures. Bummer. Now I have a wonderfully pretty pink screen. I can't take pictures and I am beginning to sense that I have wasted the $150 invested.My advise...choose something else.However...it's your money...and I am only person.I have other Kodak cameras...I bought this because of the 8mp feature.Hope this helps some of you."
4,Great buy - - -Kodak 8.2mp camera,"Great camera to grab and go. What I like best about it (and the last kodak I had (5.2mp)) is the software. As a casual camera user, I nver know which mode to choose when I shoot photos, but the Kodak tells you as you scroll thru like 20 different options. It also takes very crisp shots and travels easily. I used to be an Olympus guy, but Kodak's user interface has swayed me."
4,I <3 my camera,"I received the camera and I thought, ""it's too cute!"" It's small and can fit in your pocket. Once I started using it I hadn't really taken advantage of all its cool features but now I use them all the time to crop photos without having to do it on the computer. It wasn't too expensive and it's 8 MEGA PIXELS!!"
2,Don't buy this camera for the video feature,"I can't review the photographic quality of the camera, since I took it out of the box, turned it right to video to capture my baby's babbling. It was easy to use sure, but when I went to see the video, all I could hear was the camera's motor!! The machine noise was louder than my baby!I had a Kodak v570 (no longer made :(, and this camera is not nearly the same quality. It's light and feels cheap, not a metal case. I put it right back in the box and sent it back."
1,This camera is TOO DELICATE,I bought the V1003. Just the same one but with 10 MP.This camera has good quality pics/ 10 MB. It is kind of slow. I bought one about 25 days ago. THERE IS ONE BIG FLAW. The LCD screen is not protected. Many digital cameras do have a protective HARD COVER for the LCD screen. This camera is TOO DELICATE. I have bought more than 5 digital cameras for the last 5 years. This is the FIRST ONE that I broke the LCD screen.
5,Best camera ever,"I have been through a lot of cameras. I wanted a camera that would just take a nice picture of my baby easily with no red eye and finally after all the hard work i found it. I have had a canon, sony, panisonic,casio,and then now this kodak. It is the best purchase i have ever made and it will be yours too. You will be amazed with the quality of the pictures."
4,Kodak V803 Digital camera,"The camera was in very good shape overall, the outer signs of age & wear were correctly discribed. The camera worked very well although I couldn't manage to get the flash feature to work and when I brought this concern up to the seller, I was given options to makeup for the problem and eventually returned the camera for a full refund. The seller later responded & admitted that the flash did work although I was unable to do that.I am satisfied with this seller and I feel they are trustworthy & honest and I would likely purchase from them again."
1,not happy,this camera is not worth it i thought i got a good buy but it broke twice in one year and now its totally gone and kodak and amazon was of no help
3,Good for its purpose...,"The thing about this camera is that its a point-and-shoot. Its super easy to use, but no matter what you're doing, its extremely difficult to capture a picture that looks completely clear when it is blown up to the size its supposed to blow up to. The zoom goes up to 3.0, but is only clear to about 1.5, and the machine makes the 1.5x and more zoom seem lousy on the interface. I used this camera for a trip and got some good pictures, but was disappointed to see that many of the pictures didn't appear clearly full size.Its definitely a good camera with over 15 picture modes, but it hasn't won me over because its lack of image stabilization."
3,Hmm...,I did not like the following things about these dice. 1) They were all different colors.... 2) The bag they came with was very poor quality - plasticy and it ripped easily. 3) The dice were overpriced. There was only 7 of them and they were rather cheap.
2,"Adequate, but not a very nice set.",This will provide you with the 7 necessary dice you need to play the AD&D game or other role-playing games. But you can find much nicer dice sets for the same price at most hobby and game stores.
3,Shipping fee.....,"I like it. This is a good dice package; however, you should think about the shipping fee. It's a good way to buy it with many friends who play AD&D. All of you can share the shipping fee."
3,The Dices,The dices are good and important for ADnD but that is really annoying to use 2d10 for precentile... i suggest to buy 6 dies and a die of d100
3,They're Ok . . .,"These dice are not at all what I expected, I thought it would be a nice set at LEAST all one color, in fact there are 7 different dice all of different colors which is very hard to keep track of when you're playing with others. However, if what you're looking for is just some dice that will work, this set is perfect for you. For those of us with a more refined taste, I personally am going to shell out 10 bucks for a nice looking set of dice."
1,Don't bother.,"Unless no one in your gaming group has any dice, you're better off shopping for a set in your local hobby store. Better yet, if the parents, relative, or friend doesn't know what to buy you for a gift, tell them to go to a hobby shop and buy you some ""polyhedral dice"". **Anything** they buy should be better than this!"
2,"Entirely Random Set, with bag","I prefer works that follow no set path, and this set of dice is perfectly random enough for me. However, if you prefer a true set of dice (one that matches) then you best look elsewhere. These 7 dice are required to play to greatest game ever, AD&D. And will perform their duty well. But they are far from the finest I have seen. The bag provided will suffice, you'll see it does hold the dice. But it is made of weak synthetic materials and must be handled with care. I prefer a more durable satchel, perhaps leather, cotton, or horse hair."
3,They're Dice--that is that you need to say.,"For those of you that do not have a hobby store around you (me being one of those) there is the dilema of not being able to find a place to buy dice. These set of dice will do the job. They roll and they get a random number. They aren't the prettiest or the most ornate but they work. If you are looking for flash you are in the wrong area, but if you are looking for dice, plain old dice then you have them right here. They only get three stars cuz they are just...well dice!"
2,Melodramatic showcase for actor Ed Harris.,"One wonders why Ed Harris decided to make this film at all. As he even says he does not try to psychoanalyse Pollock -- but instead Harris in an apparent ""honest depiction"" shows Jackson as a pathetic alcholic, compulsive adulterer and possibly a suicide (and perhaps a murderer?)who is struggling to achieve recognition within the artscene circle.As far as the trademark style of Pollock, director Ed Harris shows Jackson Pollock stumbling upon a painting technique or imho a novel never-before-done gimmick which the shallow art world chooses to consume.After viewing the film one is left less appreciative of the art of Jackson Pollock given the way the film depicts him."
2,Rorschach Test,"I'm glad that Pollock gave the world his art. I'm glad that the world has the wonderful Ed Harris to tell us stories in film. But, without any real insight into what made Pollock's artistic soul tick, what we are left with in this film is mostly a bleak, depressing and somewhat disjointed portrait of an abusive alcholic who doesn't fit in socially with the self-appointed arbiters of ""what is art"" -- or anyone else, for that matter. In spite of this, he achieves success - solely due to the efforts and belief of his wife. The inevitable trajectory of self destruction continues when suddenly, out of nowhere, the gorgeous Jennifer Connelly pops in and is madly in love with him! This final insult sends wife packing. Jennifer spends the rest of the film looking ravashing and cheerfully accomodating Pollock's boorish behavior as he descends into total degeneracy and ultimate destruction. Huh???"
3,Self Destruction,"The film represents Pollock's life as an individual, and also composition of each scene was impressively beautiful. Yet I did not find the movie entertaining as viewers have to see his self-destruction that eventually bring him to death.As an artist I obtained some usuful information, but I did not find myself inspired or encouraged by this film. The success of Pollock's career was not proportional to the degree of his happiness. I don't believe it's cool to be a self-destructive artist. If being happy is an art, Pollock certainly was not a good artist."
