5,Starting the tradition over.,"I was recently the victim of a snatch and run theft and a few of my power tools were stolen and no doubt ended up in some pawn shop somewhere. Sadly, the thief took the time to pick up and steal my fathers and his fathers before him Starrett square. After many decades of use that tool was still tight, perfectly square, and a joy to use as every small scratch, stain, and even the slightly worn knurling told a story.My new one came today. It's tight, perfectly square, the edges are sharper as it hasn't been the guide for miles of scribe lines yet and yes it's a joy to use. Maybe my Grandson will someday hold it, and appreciate some slightly worn knurling."
3,Beware of Amazon advertisement,"Like all Starrett products this one is excellent. Unfortunately again Amazon falsely advertises this item as (picture) square with two extra blades BUT the verbage says ""Hardened Blade"" (no additional blades). Everyday Amazon demonstrates delclining morality."
4,READ ALL THE FINE PRINT,THE SITE THAT HAD THIS DVD LISTED SHOWED IT AS 2008 SO I THOUGHT THAT WAS WHEN THE SHOW WAS PERFORMED AND TAPED. THIS WAS TAPED FROM A 1987 PERFORMANCE. I STILL ENJOYED IT AS IT IS OLD SCHOOL TOP FEATURING ELLIS HALL AS THE LEAD SINGER BUT I WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING FEATURING LARRY BRAGS. I ALREADY HAVE THE DCD LIVE IN GERMANY THAT ONE IS 2 THUMBS UP!
3,"""Better than no live footage at all""","When I bought this I must say I was hoping for something better. I know ToP went through lead singers and lineups like lunch but I never saw this one live. The footage looks like and sounds like something left over from the High School Audo Visual Squad. While the performances are decent, inspired even, this DVD STILL doesn't provide me with what I want, Blu-Ray quality video of ToP along with Dolby TruMaster sound. This ain't it.Worf"
1,What is hip - well this is not hip,"TOP has been in business for over 40 years and had both ups and downs. This DVD is from a concert somewhere in the eighties and definately from a ""down""-period. Of course they play their a.... off, but it is also clear that both Castillo and Kupka are not in their best form (whatever is the reason for that, well maybe Castillo himself had explained that in the liner notes on the greatest hit album ""Soul with a capital S""?). Anyway, to top up the bad experience, the sound quality on this DVD is probably the worst I have ever heard. Volume changes up and down, and the general sound is muddy and unclear. The only reason to buy this DVD must be to have a complete collection of TOP releases."
2,Bummer,"I guess I should start reading the fine print............ After seeing Tower of Power recently in concert, I was excited that they had a new DVD out, well I thought, just to find out it is the exact same TOP in concert (Ohne Filter), that was released in 2003. So folks you now have a choice to buy the same identical concert.Why is it that TOP or any other great groups for that matter do not have any NEW CONCERT FOOTAGE to promote sales? For some of us that don't have a chance to see our favrorite group's, you would think this would be great marketing for those aging bands. I don't think they would loose money, as you would still have a large fan base to take in one of their concerts. Some of them sound better today than years ago.Maybe, just maybe TOP will take the time to film a concert and you will have the chance to see that their sound is better than ever."
5,My favorite DVD-R storage (of the couple I've tried),"I'll paste from my review of the ""Case Logic PSBS60 60 Cd Prosleeve Ii Cd Binder.""I've decided that the ProSleeve II will be the official storage method for all my DVD-R's.I really like the removable Prosleeves, and I like the dimensions of the (Case Logic PSBS60) case. Two discs ""tall"" and one disc wide. That makes it much easier to open and handle the case than the 2x2 dimension cases.If I had any complaint (only about the case), it's that the handle gives the case a ""sportier"" look than I really want in our living room. But I don't want to give up the Prosleeve II removable sleeves, and I want the 2-tall, 1-wide size, so this seems to be the only setup to meet my needs."
4,It's just a sleeve,"DVDs fit into both sides but just a tad tight. Serves its purpose though. And, for the price, good enough."
3,Not what I expected...,"Step by Step Fabric Painting was different from what I expected. I needed something that didn't require me to be an artist already. There are things in the book that I can use, but probably not until I can acquire a little more expertise at drawing. I thought I was getting a beginner's guide to painting on fabric. This is painting on fabric, but is geared toward an ""artist"" who wishes to paint on fabric. I hope I have made myself clear. Not a bad book, just not the book that I needed. It did have great instructions on materials needed, how to stencil, and prepare your fabric. But the designs were too intricate for me to even attempt. Hope this helps someone."
4,Great book,This book is fascinating for fabric painting beginners just like me. It gives step by step guides with plenty of beautiful pictures.Great book!
3,Okay but not as terrific as I thought,"The product is not as well-made as it appears in the ads. The water does not flow out too easily, and the materials are a bit flimsy."
2,cat food and water dishes,"Be careful...I wanted the water dish with the ""spiggot"" and got the one without. I returned it and I haven't bothered to find the correct one."
2,5-10,"Great for research and education. Very limited insight into what to actually do when presented with a anxious child. I am a clinician and I was hoping this would assist me in treatment, it has not!!"
4,enochian scrying tarot,"the book that comes with the tarot is very informative and has everything you need if you are a bigginer and so much more. It is very true to the golden dawn with the rituals but the meditations are a bit short.I have used the western tattwas and got some interesting results.still investigating but they seem to work fine with the flashing colors.I would recommend having a good sorce of light when using them. the cards are of good quility, my 1st card had a little dot on the top. must of been from the printer. nothing too distracting. they have a slippery coating so they are nice to handle. it is a bit small. could of been bigger or a standard tarot size but its still okay"
5,awsome deck!!!!,"i just got the book and deck in the mail today,any one who studys and practice's goldendawn style magic only has to glance at the deck and see the elemental colors along with the enochian and hebrew counter parts will begin to feel right at home with the deck.it is going present a great way to scry into the sprit vision along with a host of other technique's the book it comes with is over 300 pages with a wealth of information on how to use the cards,the deck to me looks flawless theres only a couple out there like it i highly recommend it.............."
3,Bland!,"I bought an unabridged recording from Audible and listened to this book while driving. The son was a very pale copy of the father. He kept telling what a nice guy he was, but his mean streak came through, particularly in the episode when he smeared an egg on his young son's face to teach him 'values'. This was an OK listen while stuck in traffic but I would have tossed the book aside in favor of something more alive if I weren't in the car."
4,A good addition to a Tudor library,"Just finished a copy of this book. Though the source of the ""Lane Letters"" remains controversial, the material and bibliography indicate a project that was well researched. Regardless of the ""Lane Letters"" I enjoyed the book and from what I can find, he is the first author to attempt to collect all of Lady Jane's literary remains. I did learn from this book and I look forward to any revisions."
1,Disappointing,I have read much more reader friendly books that incorporate primary source documents. The book was dull and did not provide any new insights or information about an interesting character in the Tudor era.
4,A challenging historical read.,This is a wonderfully told story. The language is a little difficult for younger students but is appropriate as a read-aloud for 3rd grade and up or as an independent read for middle or high schoolers.
3,"OK, but VERY slippery","Being a guy I'm NOT that fussy about soap, and this was a great price. Would just like to note, despite what another review said I find the smell a bit unpleasant. Also, I suppose it's the Vaseline, but the soap is EXTREMELY slippery when wet. VERY hard to keep a hold of. Neither issue is a deal breaker for me, but because of the 'slippery issue' it may not be the best choice for children or senior citizens."
4,Shipping delay,The shipping took more than 2 weeks to reach me. There was a package damage and got ship back to Amazon but never shipped back to me until I call customer service. Customer service was great though.
1,Too Perfumey Plus Drying,"I bought this from Amazon and do not like it. I've been giving bars away to anyone who would take a few of them. First of all it smells strongly and the smell is horrible. It also dried my skin tremendously. AND, it made me itch. I don't have particularly sensitive skin either -- I usually use Palmolive (green classic) or Zest. So, I really don't like anything about it except that it doesn't seem to disappear quickly. That's probably because I want it to! I always thought the Lever 2000 was really good soap -- guess because it costs a little more. I wouldn't take it for free!!"
2,My bathtubs get dirty much faster,"Our family bought this Lever soap with the vaseline when I couldn't find my favorite soap on amazon. We've used our supply over a period of months. My 21-year-old daughter does not like the way her skin feels after using it. I have noticed that my bathtubs develop a soap ring much faster than with any other soap we have ever used. I like Lever soaps in general, but I will avoid this particular one in the future."
5,Good Deal,"I have used Lever 2000 plenty of times and love it, however, it is kind of expensive if you cannot find it in bulk. Lo and behold I found it here. I earned some gift certificates that would be expiring soon and used it for this purchase and I don't think I will be buying any soap for a while."

4,Celebrating the Underdogs of History,"Well, Mr. Winkle is back again - tongue and all! ""A Winkle In Time"" is the historic depiction of untold heroes. His cuteness portrays and tells the story of life's underdogs through in his own way. From Arab Architects to Laika (the Russian Space dog)he covers the globe and beyond!"
4,Too cute to be real,Mr.Winkle is the cutest dog in the universe. He is so cute I sometimes doubt he is even real. I love all his books and my daughter fell in love with the Mr. Winkle stuffed animal. She is now taking her own Mr. Winkle pictures. I only gave it four stars because I WANT MORE PICTURES!
5,Uniquely Creative,"As it seems that today's music world revolves around genres and categories, it's often hard to distinguish one band from another. Not so with Jupiter Sunrise. Having two songwriters gives the album a variety--from the playful, rockin-out ""Arthur Nix"" to the intense, emotionally-charged ""Heaven And Endless."" The riffs and progressions are far from conventional. The lyrics draw the listener into the world of the writers, making them feel at once as if they've known the band for years. Catchy, easy to sing along to, the album can put a smile on your face and bring a tear to your eye at the same time."
5,Great band!,"I first heard JS when they played a free show at my school and my boyfriend made me go--and I've been hooked ever since. We went and saw them in Oakland recently, and they are such an awesome live band, better than the other 5 that were there, and their CD is great. I could listen to it over and over again, and the guys are great. Chris (the drummer) gave me points (and a hug) for being the best dancer on the drum riser. :DBuy this CD!"
5,Waiting a long time for this CD,"I have been listening to Jupiter Sunrise for three years, and I am so excited about their contracted album. I have seen them live about 6 times, and their music just gets better with time. If you enjoy rock you will love Jupiter Sunrise. And if you have an oppurtunity I suggest seeing them live!"
5,Greatness,"Talk about good. Good doesn't even begin to describe it. What an awesome way to spend 12 bucks (that is what i bought it for, not sure what it is on here). I saw them live twice and want to see it again over and over again. This is a great band. If you are unsure about buying the cd, BUY IT!"
3,Weird but Fun,"This band's music is really weird. And the lead singer isn't really very great. But what works for them is the 'We know we're weird and we like it' deal. Their songs are catchy and fun and so this album is fun to listen to a few times though it does get old pretty fast.Stand out tracks include 'Kaye', 'Arthur Nix' and 'Cherry Wine'."
2,Jupiter sunrise,"i heard the three songs, arthur nix, kaye, and steal me. I loved them and wanted to hear some more. I especially thought that having two amazing lead singers really added to their songs. I heard a little of cherry wine and loved it too, so i decided to buy the cd. Honestly, it doesn't have much more than that. I still love those 4 songs and keep the cd because of them but the rest of them are nothing special at all and one of them is just terrible. It almost seems like two different bands. but if jupiter sunrise can come out with an album with all songs like the previous mentioned, they would be my favorite band."
5,Insightful about the Corps,"Blood Stripes: The Grunt's View of the War in Iraq by David Danelo is a straight punch to the gut of the American people who pay lip service on supporting our troops without ever knowing what that means. Blood Stripes is an on the ground, in the dust and heat and thick of battle account of what it means to be a United States Marine in Iraq.Danelo does a wonderful job of telling the stories of the Marines he served with. In my opinion, Blood Stripes is a masterful job of relating what its like to be shot at and how Marines are taught to overcome obstacles that often keep other units from meeting their mission. Mission is everything.Well done and a must read for those who want to be informed.Semper Fi"
3,Blood Stripes: The Grunt's View of the War in Iraq,"As a former Marine,I was anxious to read this book. The author makes the point that Marine Corps NCO's are the leaders on a battlefield and crucial to success. However I don't feel he was able to aptly describe the mem he wrote about. He gives a great amount of detail yet I thought something was missing. Itwas still an interesting read."
4,War Perspective from one who served,"I was interested in the daily routine of the war in Iraq, and that is what was covered. I am a veteran of the Viet Nam war, and wanted to get a better idea of the differences in how these wars were conducted, and the motivation of those involved."
3,"Okay, I suppose","Although I am a former service member and currently work for the armed forces, I found that this read was far to technical to remain focused on it for any length of time. I found myself re-reading several pages at a time to understand some of the things and it was not hard to put down at all..."
2,Couldn't finish it.,I bought this book for my Marine husband. He found it dull and couldn't get past more than half the book. He said that he would not reccomend the book. Perhaps someone who isn't a Marine would enjoy it.
4,Solid inside look at reality,"Captain Danelo's book rings with truth. I feel for the first time that I have some idea what daily life in the Sunni Triangle is like for our Marines. It is a real war, not the camps full of Burger Kings and department stores that some would have us believe.The characters are real, if somewhat simply drawn. They fight under impossible conditions, and are asked constantly to decide who the enemy is...and isn't.My only problem was, as a non vet, it was often difficult for me to track who was part of Bravo 1/5 vs. Kilo 3/7, and where they were in-country.Otherwise, a good read, well dialogued and fast moving. It also refuses to dwell on the grittier aspects of Marine life and language, making it suitable for younger teens as well as all adults."
5,MARINES IN COMBAT!,"OUTSTANDING WORK MARINE!The best book I have read on the war in Iraq from the grunts point of view...up close and personal.This book should be required reading for any civilian who insists on applying the same standards to Marines in combat in an urban enviornment as they do to Police Officers on patrol in downtown Manhattan!Times, uniforms and weapons change....but the warrior spirit remains.I miss the Corps...and I especially miss my Marines.SEMPER FIDELIS!"
5,Exquisite versions of popular brazilian songs,"This trio use their voices in such a way, that you don't miss the musical instruments. It's a pleasure to listen to this CD (and others from this trio).I brought one back to Uruguay (where it was unknown), and they used it as reference material for choruses.A must for lovers of ""classic"" brazilian music."
4,A Good TV Movie,"This film has played on Lifetime, and I have watched it twice. It was originally played as a movie of the week on network tv. I could be wrong?. It was filmed in the eighties. (I was a youngin during this time, so my mom would not have let me watch this on tv.) It's not one of those PREACHY 80s movies. I give it a solid B. I plan to purchase this for my dvd collection."
1,not worth it!,"I was really disappointed with this one! There are some other much better books online---I say, keep surfing amazon.com!"
5,GREAT PRODUCT AT GREAT PRICE,Ordered this product for a friend. Got them very quickly!! Fit like a glove!! Many thanks from myself and my friend Tyrone!!
4,Great talent... but,Rebecca Pidgeon has a unique voice that I love to hear.... I still play her Spanish Harlem over and over (from album Raven) -- I would like to hear a better band with Rebecca... and some different arranging and better recording. Her voice would go well with a grand and very small combo... perhaps acoustic guitar and rhythm..... I would predict a great increase in sales if she adopted a combo more suited to her voice. That said.... this is a pretty good album.
3,A stunning voice for small venues .......................,"In the two albums by her that I own, there are only two good songs, both on this album. Mostly her lyrics are too intellectual, but on ""Tangerine"" and ""The Romance Of Everyday Life"" she finds a nice balance of emotion that lifts them far above the others. The former is a really good song, which shows she does have it in her, and the latter is a very breezy, fun tune.She has a lovely voice which is slightly limited in range, but very capable of working its way around a complex lyric. I just hope she will leave the literary prizes to her husband and write more from the gut and the heart. Samples of all tunes are at allmusic.com."
1,not the original group,"WOW!!WHAT A DISAPOINTMENT!! THE ORIGINAL VOGUES ARE PICTURED ON THE COVER,BUT WHATS INSIDE IS ANYTHING BUT.ITS JUST ANOTHER FAKE VOGUE CD.HERES A HINT:IF YOU ARE GOING TO CALL YOURSEVES THE VOGUES AT LEAST TRY TO IMITATE THAT SPECIAL SOUND THEY HAVE!DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CD."
1,Don't care too much,"Trust me, I am not saying that this is a bad collection, Faith No More is one of the most influential but also most underated bands of all time. It's not the songs that make this a bad deal but the fact that it says it has extra tracks as an added bonus. In truth, the American version has a second disk with two or three extra songs on it, including ""This Guy's In Love With You"" which if you ask me is a true FNM clasic, and yet you don't even get it on this import. Trust me, buy the American version, there's absolutely nothing ""extra"" on this disc in the least."
5,Broken Dishes,"I have purchased Corelle products before. I highly recommend them. However, I do not recommend purchasing them from Amazon. They were shipped to me on three different occasions and every time some of the dishes were broke due to poor packing. There was very little packing material on the inside and the outside of the box was not even marked fragile. I am happy with the product but not with Amazon's packing and shipping methods."
2,Corelle dinnerware,"This is the second set of Corelle I have ordered and returned. The color shown online isn't any where close to what the actual set looks like - it's far more pink that I had wanted. It just looked cheap overall. My old set is 15 years old, and the new dishes aren't the same quality as the older sets. I've given up on finding another Corelle set for our everyday use. Amazon was guick in processing my credits. Thank you!"
5,Corelle Lifestyle Classic Touch 16-Piece,Corelle Lifestyle Classic Touch 16-PieceExcellent seller. Thank you.
2,Q: What size are these? A: Probably the wrong size.,"I swear somewhere it said 35"" laces; what i got was 27"". Can't they put the size on the package, or in the description?"
2,so much for the wax,"These are thick laces, and braiding is visible. There is no wax, unless the definition of ""waxed"" has changed. They are definitely 27'' (or ""4-5 eyelets""), which limits their usage with dress shoes. It is true they are single color, but this is what I wear with running shoes.Also, FYI they are made in India. They still carry $1.99 pricetag from the supermarket AWi. So two stars, because you get a bargain!"
1,A PIECE OF GARBAGE,"THIS PHONE NOT ONLY DOESN'T WORK, BUT THE AC ADAPTER GETS SO HOT YOU COULD GET BURNT OR POSSIBLY START A FIRE. THIS PHONE SHOULD BE PULLED FROM DISTRIBUTION. SAVE YOUR MONEY."
5,Atlas Hopper,"Model railroaders know Atlas quality. Nicely detailed , very free rollinggood addition to the layout."
2,Had to send them back...,"I was disappointed with these shoes. They look very cute from the picture, but they didn't fit right and the back piece that connects the shoe base to the ankle straps doesn't lay flat against your heel; it sticks out in the back, giving the shoe a frumpy look. I am a very consistent size 6.5, so when that size fits so awkwardly, I have to assume it's the way the shoe is made. I was also thinking the shoe would be a sweet pink shoe I could wear to work and with church clothes, and it looks more like a shoe one would wear to a strip club. I sent them back."
5,A Well Cited Resource,"What a great read. The author does an incredible job citing both what the Catholic Church teaches and what the Bible teaches. Thus doing so essentially removes all opinion and let's the reader see the problematic doctrine that the RCC has in light of God's Word. I am so appreciative of the author doing all the background work and allowing me to then know exactly where to go without spending hours of searching.I highly recommend this book to both Catholics and those that have a heart to reach Catholics with the gospel.I would like to make a comment that of all the negative reviews for this book, only one negative review actually comments on the book's content specifically and appears to have truly read it. Sadly the other negative reviews simply seem to be using this book review listing as a place to share their frustration with those that are confronting the RCC with God's Truth."
1,Mike Gendron is a dime a dozen,"Yet another ""dime store"" evaneglical using anti catholic rhetoric, anti protestant rhetoric to steam his personal cause.I caution all those who need to be fed the Gospel of Jesus Christ NOT to follow another ""dime store"" evangelical who claims to know more Christianity then every christian denomination including Catholic. And who also claims to be an authority on sacred scripture. Anti Catholic rhetoric is the steam behind Mr.Gendron's efforts unfortanetly. Very in appropriate approach and something Jesus warns us against.Personally, I'd rather not waste my time arguing over bible verses while there are murderers, slanders, and abortionists running rampant! Use your Christian time doing good for God's marginalized and innocent. Don't let Mike Gendron confuse you."
1,Illogical,"Let's set the record straight. Catholics believe in salvation by faith and works, Protestants believe in faith alone.How then can a Protestant say that Catholics who have faith are going to Hell?That is the false assumption that this whole book rests on. In the rest of it you will find the typical Protestant rhetoric that tries to pull people from the fullness of the Catholic faith into Protestant sectarian confusion. This book is a lie of Satan."
1,ANTI CATHOLIC HATE LITERATURE,"This is more anti-catholic material by a person who has an extremely narrow view of all religious beliefs but his own. Not only does he hate Catholics but only respects those that follow his very peculiar interpretation of the Bible. He represents a very small minority of sects which based their teachings on a narrow and twisted view of scripture that is in oppostion to most major christian denominations not only catholics. if you hate catholics, this is the book for you! If you want truth, save your money."
1,Hogwash,"St. Paul himself calls Abraham 'Father' multiple times and St. Paul himself, in regards to the Eucharist states, 'What I received I'm handing on to you' this equals tradition. I recommend to the author and the Anti-Catholic ""friends"" (nice friends) to spend an hour before the Blessed Sacrament and learn at Jesus' feet. Oh yeah-try kneeling as well. You might also study the history of the Church Christ founded and see if the gates of hell hath prevailed or if Christ was just wrong. How sad to be a protestant and miss the fullness of the Catholic faith. You'll be in my prayers."
5,Vacuum check valve,"This is an item that I used to get the vacuum heater valve to work. It actually works to block the vacuum from slacking off when the manifold vacuum slacks off under acceleration. The item was delivered, as I have come to expect from Amazon, ahead of schedule and in good condition. Thanks, I needed it."
2,A poorly made check valve,"It's hard to find a check valve of such a small stature, but I found this one.It didn't do the job for me as fluid and air definitely flowed backward back through the check valve.It looked of poor quality when I unwrapped it, so I don't even know why I tried it thinking it would work.Go with something metal or PE in material. Spend the extra ten bucks on something else and get what you need!"
1,Useless,"Didn't even last a day! If I could give it 0 Stars I would. Don't waste your money! Go get a bigger, more robust Check Valve."
5,Nice and Solid,I was suprised when I got the boot that it fit as well as it did. Plenty of room in the toe. Its fairly flexible when new but will require breaking in but thats not bad at all. High quality leather and I look forward to using them.
4,Caterpillar Boots,iI LIKE THE FIT AND THE WAY THE BOOTS LOOK AND THE PRICE OF THE BOOTS AND THEY ARE FOR THE WEATHER
4,"good, but a little room for improvement","I've been wearing these boots for about a week, they are breaking in now but at first I was worried. The materials feel like they are good quality and the construction appears to be solid. These boots are a little on the heavy side, the tread pattern is fairly ""aggressive"", and it takes several days to get rid of the new boot/leather smell. The lowest lace hooks are on a piece of floating nylon strap, I guess you could remove it if you wanted but I don't get the point - it just makes lacing up slightly harder since you have a potentially moving target.I have wide toes but my heal is normal, these boots (14Wide) are great for my toes but loose for the heal; my heal tends to move around more than previous boots but that has been getting better over time."
2,Mostly unlistenable....,"Not even good for background music/noise as the voices get really loud in certain parts and almost silent.I bought this CD and am returning it. It's just more & more of the sameness throughout the whole CD.I realize that Ligeti is avant garde but I heard that if you like Gregorian chant (which I do) this CD is similar. I don't think it is. It's very disquieting and full of tension (great, if that's the mood you're looking for)."
4,Important reading,"My only disappointment -- and it wasn't the fault of the book or the author -- was that it was not about the U.S., although there certainly are connections. If you have doubts about satanic ritual/cult abuse, this book is a baseline for any kind of awareness. And there ARE connections between satanic ritual abuse and government mind control experimentation, sad as that may be. I read this book a while ago, but was not going to review it because it is out of print and I got it somewhere else...until I saw it reviewed here by somebody else. Let me add my voice to those who are also in the trenches digging this stuff up. Don't allow the voices to be silenced! Don't allow the secrets to be buried! As long as we do that, our children, future children, will remain at risk."
3,Passable but not great,"My mother bought this car seat for her vacation home so we wouldn't have to lug our everyday infant seat with us when we visit. We liked that this seat can go from rear- to forward-facing and also to booster, with a wide range of weights. However we found it enormous for our 3 month, who's on the bigger side. Granted, he's only 3 months, but still, this thing made him look puny. The seat took up so much space in the car, which is a Lincoln Continental and NOT small, it was very tight to fit in two adults in the back seat along with this car seat. Also, the straps twisted really easily and both the chest clasp and the between-the-legs clasp were difficult to use. We definitely wouldn't recommend buying this seat."
5,Really Works,"I can't believe how easy this is to use! I had 3 sweaters and a little black dress that weren't really dirty but needed to be freshened up. You just place them in the dryer with the dryer sheet, 30 minutes later my clothes looked great. While there was a somewhat sweet smell to the dryer cloth before I used it, afterwards my clothes had hardly any noticeable fragrance at all. Will definitely use it again."
2,Cute yet cheap,"Within a month of use, the handle of the butter knife had fractures in it and the rim of the top had a chip. It is cheaply made."
5,Cover,"Okay.... Excellent product... First class, premium... Fit for the high class yuppy snob... Fits perfectly, and looks great on my 2007 CBR600RR.... You will have the best cover in your neighborhood hands down... Downside.... Really expensive..."
5,nice book,Very nice quality guest book. Perfect gift for friends moving out of state! Can't wait to make our first entry!
1,NEEDED MANUAL,"I purchased this item for my 90 year old mother who lives in another state. When the phones arrived, the manual was only in French and Spanish. I called to get a manual in English. She did not know how to put her answering message on the machine. When last I checked, she still had not received the manual even though I called three different places. I think the product is good, but that was not a good mistake to make. Obviously the person I talked to was in a different country, because of the difficulty of communicating and the echo that was on the phone. I am surprised that AT&T would have such a bad phone connection for customer service. I will be going to my mother's in two weeks and can perhaps correct the problem then. I purchased this phone because of the reviews that said it was easy to use. I can't rate the product at this time until I see it first hand."
2,Lasted for only a year,I bought this phone when it first came out and paid around 70.00 for it. A year later one of the receivers will not answer incoming calls. I can call out on it but will not let me answer. I have contacted ATT about this problem and they have no clue what it going on and don't really seem to care. I love the phone besides this problem but cannot give it a good review for the amount of hassle it has caused me.
2,Not happy at all,"The price seemed great for a brand name phone, but the sound is awful - it echos and scratches and switching channels makes no difference at all. I've had 2.4 GHz phones before that sounded just fine, so I do not think that is the problem. Frequently, the phone will not connect when the talk button is pressed the first time. I have to press off -then phone -then off- then phone until a connection finally is made. The worst thing is you can only speak on one phone at a time. Each phone acts independently - so will not function as an extension. You can switch to speaker phone, but it requires everyone be in the same room to hear. The speaker phone quuaity is only fair. I needed a 2nd extension and it was not clear to me in the description that this phone would not work that way. The only thing I like is the answering machine. The answering maching is easy to operate and clear.I am on my way out to buy another phone from a different company."
3,it's ok,"i bought these phones because of the good reveiws. i'm not impressed. everything works as far as the features go so far. the range isn't that great. if i go outside it gets static. oh yeah i bought this phone on feb. 20, 07, guess what the battery in one phone doesn't work anymore. they both worked fine and one morning the phone rang accept that phone and after playing with it figured out it was the battery. this phone was the second base unit so it's not used very much and i've only had the phones for 5 weeks. there's no reason the battery should be dead. i'm calling at&t to see if they will send me a new battery since it's under the year warrenty, i'll let ya now what happens. so it's an OK phone in my opinion. i'd look for something a little better. at&t have better phones."
2,Doesn't last,"We have had this system for 2 years now. Its going in the trash. Everyone of the chargers (3 and main unit )have quit. We have replaced the batteries but to no avail they won't work. The new batteries worked for about 3 months and now we again get the ""Check Battery"" message. To be fair, we are beginning to wonder about a lightning issue but nothing else has been affected.On another note from day one the reception in my studio in the back yard has not been great. I have to step out on to the back porch to get good reception. The prior phone was better.We won't be buying ATT again."
5,AT&T Cordless Phones,I have tried several cordless phones in the past and this set is wonderful. A co-worker recommended these to me.
5,cheap cordless phone,"You usually get what you pay for, but I wasn't willing to pay a lot for something we use so infrequently. The reviews I had read indicated this was a quality unit and the price was right. It's the best phone and answering machine we've ever had. Good stuff!"
2,Really liked this phone but.......,I purchased this phone in June 07 and enjoyed the quality and service until recently. The phone has stopped charging and I have been trying to get the problem resolved for 2 days. At&t said to send it back after a 10 minute hold for customer service.
2,echo's,I like the esy use of the phone...problem is when I call certain people there is an echo and it drives me crazy. I can hear myself in the phone....so I wouldn't buy again
1,bad quality awful service- do not buy it,My phone is less than a year old the batteries went dead and not a single electronic store sales the replacement batteriesWhen I tried to buy them form att or to get info on where to get new batteries they just told me I have to buy a new phone.More over not only their customer support is well below decent but also service representatives on the phone are rude and not considered and when I tried to pass my complains to her manager she just hung up on me.do not buy this product unless you want waste your time and money and buy a new phone 6 month from now
1,Worthless,"you get what you pay for. You want cheap you will get cheap. My phone is echoey sounding. Well, both of my cordless phones are. it picks up sound from all over my home and transmits it into the call on the line. The LCD features are ok- not impressive but plain old OK. The channel button does not do what it should do, at least not that well. The thing I like about this phone is the transfer feature,but most phones nowadays have that. Did I mention there is no page feature on the 2nd handset so once you phone is lost you will have to call your own number to find it."
2,Horrible Shoes,"This shoes is to narrow, I wear only one day, hurt and my toe get bubble. Throw away already."
2,Too much like a pre-education college class,"This book talks about interpersonal skills and personality styles in a textbook-like format. The content is the same as pre-education college classes. The book goes on and on about learning styles. The information is valuable if you are a complete donkey of a person (which some managers really are) and don't have a clue about how to relate to people. Yes, this book will be valuable to those who REALLY need it, but I say that if you are of average or above-average intelligence, have taken college psychology or pre-education/early childhood classes, and/or have had sales experience in your career, this book will be a big waste of time for you because you've already learned how to handle people."
1,a juvenile piece of tripe,"This book is appropriate for grade-schoolers learning to work in groups/teams. The text offers little in terms of strategies, methods or techniques for managing people and instead focuses on identifying personality traits and working with personal space. A disappointment in all regards (It's also a very boring read)."
3,It Works...,This a fairly decent product that works and delivers on it's claims...but that's it.If you want a very basic unit that's not at all user-friendly with only the minimum features and functions...this is it.
2,Not The Best,"Hoodia Gordonii Pure Extract did have directions as to how it should be taken. It was advertised as pure, but I found it to be very weak and ineffective. I found it to be a waste of money. I would not recommend this product for purchase."
5,!!!!!!!!!!The Great One Is Back Baby!!!!!!!!!,Andrea Crouch was always ahead of his time and this cd shows he still know how put awesome words along with awesome musical composition. This CD is a absolute collectors item. The Return Album. He's Back!!
4,Great for a beginner or first time user!,"This focuser is a little on the basic side so if you are just starting out and don't want to invest a whole lot right now, this one is great. It is totally made out of plastic, even the part that slides down into the telescope and which holds your lenses. I wasn't expecting that so because of this, I would recommend it to those who are looking for an inexpensive piece but aren't looking for anything special. It works great and it gets the job done."
3,Cheap replacement focuser,"I replaced a .960 focuser on an old Tasco 4"" reflector with the ""Orion Basic 1.25 inch Focuser"" so that I have the option of using higher quality eyepieces. This focuser fill the bill perfectly. It is not heirloom quality but works very well. It is perfect for inexpensive scopes. It operates with minimum backlash and holds eyepieces securely.Well worth the money in the right applications."
4,"Finally, A Good Book on PCB Basics","There are plenty of PCB books out there, but Flatt's Printed Circuit Board Basics seems to be the only one that brings it all together in a basic, short, orderly format. If you don't mind searching through four or five hundred pages for basic info on PCBs then the other books are fine. But why do that, when Flatt's book does it for you.He gives you a good idea of the steps of how a standard PCB is manufactured. Although a few steps maybe outdated (ex. punch cards). There are even some IPC and Mil-Spec standards given, but here again some standards maybe outdated (but you can find the latest versions on the web).The title of the book says it all. Get the book if you want a basic foundation on PCBs."
1,Do Not Do Business with SunRocket - Beware,"My review relates to this product as it's a sunrocket device. My advice is go with a different VOIP service. There's many out there ! But after 2 weeks trying to work a customer service issue with Sunrocket, and being bounced around, I gave up.They do not have a number to their billing department. If you ask them to transfer you there they say billing will email you. Bottom line..small startup company..with immature customer support department.Don't use Sunrocket at all ! But only my suggestion."
5,Fantastic,"This Blu-ray pack is almost perfect, except that there is director's commentary for Legacy. The second screen is nice, but a commentary would have rounded out the bonus features. This would have made the set perfect. As for Tron original, it is very well done and the extras are fantastic. All in all, a fantastic buy."
2,Maybe it would register with gamers.,"Animation is trivial compared to that in ""Avatar"", not in the same universe. There is way too much of actors standing/sitting around spouting naive philosophy. The ""frisbees"" are ridiculous.After all the rave reviews I saw, I was extremely disappointed."
2,CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP,"I just received my Tron 5 disc combo pack and the only feeling I can describe is that I've been robbed. This is a cheap plastic case, the hinge is already cracked (just got it 25 minutes ago), the button for the light looks like it has been chewed out by hamsters. Nothing wrong with the discs (all are great). But don't order this box set.....you will be GRAVELY disappointed !!!!"
2,Collectors Disc packaging,"I purchased the $64.00 version of the Tron disc set. I am EXTREMELY unhappy with the case, the DVD's are literally stacked on top of each other... so to get to one DVD you have to pretty much take them all out. This case WILL cause the DVD's to scratch. While a cool concept very bad execution on the part of these guys. I love the movies but will most likely have to buy a new case to take care of the DVD's. The light on the case also does not stay on for a period of time the only way to get the light on is to hold it...this would be very cool to display but due to the button it is now a silly unusable toy....come on Disney!"
4,Superior quality - 3D not as epic as in theatre,"i got the 5 Disc Combo Pack (Whaaaat?)Tron original blu-rayTron legacy Blu-raytron-legacy 3D Blu-raytron-legacy DVD & digital copy.ok this is the best tron collection you're gonna get sogo on and buy this one. (i got it used for $30 i think)The Tron-legacy Blu Ray was SUPER HIGH RESOLUTIONgraphics, and on your 240 hz 3D tv it will BLAZE with epicsmoothness with out getting blurry at all.the Audio was Just as immense as in the theatre on my7.1 surround set up (turn your bass up when you watch this)Finally the 3D aspect was WAAAY better than the tech demosthat came with the TV but no where near as Epic as it was in Theatre.if you didn't see it in theatre, sorry you missed out on the best 3Dmovie to hit the big screen. all i can say is watch it with the lights offto make it slightly better.overall i gave it 4 stars because the 3D wasn't that great.Also Jeff Bridges is the man~!"
5,Cool Case,"All four versions of Tron Legacy; DVD, Blueray, 3D Blueray, and Digital plus the original movie from the eighties is good but in a case that is a light up program disc from Legacy that is really cool."
5,I wish I had seen this in the theaters.,"I meant to catch this movie when it was still in the theaters and I'm kicking myself for not seeing it. I really enjoyed it. Everything from the costume design, set design, and action sequences were top notch. The story was interesting and this package comes with a ton of extras. Well worth the money."
3,Big Package,There is a lot in the box too bad the movie isn't better. 3D is a bit weak. It couldn't save the movie for me. Plus it didn't add much to the viewing experience. Most of the time I could barely tell it was 3D. I had hoped for more depth and for more excitement. My advice is if you want this movie skip the extra cost of the 3D. I really wish I could recommend it. To the movie makers do more with 3D and make certain one can actually tell it is in 3D in every scene.
5,Great Movie,I enjoyed this product very much. The case is awesome and all the extra features are quite amazing. Would recommend for all Tron fans.
3,Horrible Packaging,"Ditto the previous posts regarding the product packaging. The discs are stacked on top of each other over a central post. Removing the discs is difficult. You really have to push down on the center post to release a disc, and I still end up bending the disc 20-25% at the edge. I can't believe I paid $65 for this. Traditional packaging would have been much better. Otherwise, the film is excellent. It's a great addition to any Blu-Ray collection, just skip the collector's packaging."
3,The DVD Identity Disk Case does NOT CLOSE.,"I'm amazed. I really am. I paid about nearly 70 bucks for this, and it arrives, I open the packaging only to find that the identity disk disk holder is gaping open. No amount of effort will close it.This is not a review of the disks themselves, I haven't even viewed them yet. I'm so disappointed in the crappy packaging that I actually paid extra for, and want to be worth justifying that extra cost.Now I have to stuff this back into a box and ship it back and get another one in the hopes that I got a bum copy of the packaging. I'm not at all happy here.Sean."
1,Terrible Edition,"The name of this set needs to be the terrible edition. The LED lights on the disc are a joke. I can not even tell they are on unless the room is pitch black. Unlike the picture of the product that shows is nice and illuminated. So if you decide to look past that, getting the disc out is a joke. They are all stacked on top of each other and are almost impossible to get out. I would stay away from this set as i am returning mine immediately and going to best buy to buy them individually."
2,What 3D,The movie was ok but I thought the 3D fx stunk compared to some of the other 3D movies out there.
2,Would not have gotten the Identity Disc Collectible Packaging,"For the movie, Tron: Legacy looks great in 3D and regular blu-ray. The original Tron looked much better on video cassette... that old of computer graphics will never look good on blu-ray.More importantly, skip on the collectors Identity Disc set. Thought the Identity Disc would be better quality then a McDonald's kids toy. So when Tron 3 comes out on blu-ray... I'm buy the standard edition blu-ray."
3,Read the product description before buying,"Make sure you read EVERYTHING about this product before ordering. I ordered this combo pack because it said that it included BluRay, DVD and Digital copy. The DVD and Digital copy are for Tron: Legacy and not the Classic Tron like I was wanting. I didn't purchase this for the 3D because I more so wanted the DVD and Digital copy of the Classic. But also with the 3D, you need the special TV, glasses and BluRay or PS3 player to play it. If you go to Walmart they have better prices. Unless you really want the 3D, get it cheaper elsewhere."
2,SLOW,"Well the movie has been out since Tuesday, and today is Saturday and I still have not received it. This will be the last movie I pre-order from Amazon. All my friends have watched it as they went to Walmart or wherever to get it. Just can't believe that it's been 5 days and still no movie."
1,Nope.....,"Spent 5 bucks last night to see this on PPV. Was so disappointed-I really like Jeff Bridges and really wanted to like this movie. However, this movie seemed disjointed and forced and you could tell they spent all the time trying to create a visual spectacular (no), but little or no time on an actual story that made sense or even flowed well. The CG Flynn was horrible and kept taking me out of the experience. Surely Disney animators could have created a better visual that that.If I had spent any time and money seeing that at the theater last December, angry would not even begin to describe how I would have felt coming out of the theater after Tron:Legacy ended. I think I am a bit pissed about that 5 dollars last night...."
2,Format Overload,Why would anyone need every available format? Why not include Bluray 3d (with left-eye only non 3d mode) and digital download? You're paying for what amounts to be a bunch of coasters and one disc you will use.
2,thought this was dave chappelle's new movie,"Greetings fellow amazonians I picked this up because I thought this was an extension of the dave chappelle show and his character tron. This had nothing to do with that. This has some moron trying to escape his 80's atari game while he kills bad guys. Spoiler alert: it sucks! Don't bother with this movie I would have. If they ever try to do this again please include frogger, pitfall or adventure. Not some silly game that has crappy motorcycles. Btw I have called amazon and asked for the dave chappelle movie I will let you know how that goes."
2,two stars (up from zero) for including the original,"can't agree more with the official product review. while a sight to behold, Legacy's script makes Transformers seem Shakespearean. Disney should have plonked every bit of dialog, every scene with an overacting stereotype, and released this as a 10 minute Daft Punk music video.two stars for bundling the infinitely better original Tron on Blu-ray, otherwise zero."
3,Collectible fail,"I just wanna say few words about what this ""collectible packaging"" is. Well, it is just a piece of crap. Stinky (literally), bad-looking piece of plastic made in China. Also plastic material is matt and tends to keep all your fingerprints. And it is very hard to get disks from inside of it. So it's totally not worth bying. If you want all 5 discs just go for the five-disc combo and spend your saved money for The Art of Tron: Legacy. That artbook is really epic."
4,Shou;d have included the digital copy of the original,This package should have included the digital copy of the original movie since it is the one that created the world in which the movie takes place and created the concepts that the second movie is trying to capitalize on. They may have saved a few bucks but they have not enhanced my value or my interest in buying more of their products. Can the 3d and give what people want.
5,Great Deal,"This is great package deal you get First Film, 3D Version, Standard, DVD and Digital Copy.As of July 6 2011; this package is still better deal then buying the two movies separate."
4,Very good!,"This combo is really amazing: two movies (the original is always the best but the new one is OK), a lot of special features, digital copy, DVD, Blu-Ray and 3D in the same item. Good purchase if you are a fan of this kind of movies!"
4,A great follow-up to the first LEG companion,"If you bought the first one, make sure to get the second one too.No one knows obscure Victoriana popular culture minutae like Jess Nevins. Except maybe Alan Moore, of course.And if you bought either of Moore and Kevin O'Neill's League of Extraordinary Gentlemen collections, then you owe it to yourself to get Jess' annotations and other other ruminations that can be found in this new book."
1,Failure,It would be nice to suggest you buy this book. I don't because you can google and get the same footnotes on the internet. For free.
3,eeehhhh,"The sound quality was so so. I disagree with the ""greatest hits"" label. It was missing many of my favorites."
2,Simply OK,"I haven't enjoyed this one very much. As a matter of fact, I passed it on. Seemed lackluster somehow."
1,Stops working after several months.,"I have owned two Hydor Theo 25W heaters. The first I used in a 2.5gal aquarium with betta for 5 months, and it worked great. I got rid of the 2.5 gal tank for a 5.5gal tank, and the heater worked for only a few more months. At first, the temperature was 2 degrees higher then what I set it to. Soon, it was 4 degrees higher. Finally, it consistently kept it at over 8 degrees higher, and at this point the LED/heater never shut off. Soon it stopped heating altogether. I bought a second one which malfunctioned within three months of use in the 5.5 gal tank. My betta got developed severe fin rot from the inconsistent temperature."
2,Overheats- killed my betta,"This heater is supposed to adjust the water in the tank to the setting you select on the dial. I set the dial to 79 degrees for my betta. After a few hours, the tank was at 79 and the light indicator turned off (meaning that the heater turned off). When I woke up, the tank was at 86 degrees and rising (the light indicator was on) and my fish was fading fast. The betta passed away the following day and while I now know that this heater runs hot (I set it to 74 and it stays at 80), this is a dangerous thing to learn and I would recommend it only if you test it for a few days without a fish in the tank."
3,Consistently Inaccurate,"I have only had this product for a day, so I can not speak on its longevity. I have it in a 5 gallon rimless tank with no lid, and it holds it at a consistent 76 degrees in a room temp of only 68-69. However, I have to set the dial at 81 to get results of 76. I have had several different brand heaters in the past, and the quality of this appears to be ok, but the dial was not properly calibrated. Overall I am happy with this product, it heated quickly, and holds the temp steady."
2,wrong product?,"I purchased this item expecting the ""Hydor THEO Submersible Aquarium Heater 25W UL"" however what i received was the hydor aquarium heater (the one in the picture). so basically the title is to the wrong product. i am not sure who to speak to about this but i am not very happy. I am not even sure if it is safe to submerge."
1,Does not work,"I think I got a bad heater, compare to the reviews on here mine doesn't work at all. The temp inside my tank was 75 degrees; I put the heater in and set it to 79 degrees. 3 hours later I come back to check on it and the temp inside the tank was STILL at 75 degree. I see the little red light turning on the heater & I touch the heater inside the tank it was some what warm so I thought it needed more time. Over night it even went down to 74.6 degrees inside my tank with the heater on. I even turn the heater up to 80 degrees still my little 3 gallon tank temp is at 75. I would send the heater back but it's not worth the shipping to send it back. I bought a marine land heater & it's doing a great job."
2,The thermostat doesnt work!,It heats the tank well enough--- its the third heater my roommate and i have added to our ten gallon tank and the temperature is finaly staying where we want it to-- but when i change the thermostat by 15 degrees the tank temperature changes by about two.
2,Great features. Bad function-ability.,I would not recommend this product for any tank greater than 5 gallons. I currently am using it in a 10 gallon in conjunction with an additional heater and my water ceases to rise above 75 degrees although I do have it set to the max setting (87 degrees F I believe). General rules for buying heaters: Always buy a heater that claims to support a tank 20-30 gallons more than the one you need to heat. The two stars are for the indicator light and temperature dial.
2,Lasted less than a year,"I use tank heaters to keep my home brew warm while it's fermenting. It doesn't go in the brew, just in a tub of water around the fermenter. It worked fantastic for the roughly 8 gallons it was required for. The dial always seemed slightly off (had to turn it up 2F+ higher than what I actually saw with a digital thermometer) but it was consistent, I'm fine with that. It stopped working correctly after 10 months even though I treated it well and was always careful. I think the internal thermostat is broken, it turns on and off but even turned all the way up it's only heating to 65F which is not warm enough for my brew, I need it about 71F. I also purchased the 150Watt version from Hydor around the same time, that one is still working great but I'm concerned it will have the same fate as the 25W. I trying a competing brand with good reviews:Aqueon 06106 Pro Heaters Submersible Aquarium Heater, 100-Watt"
2,No good. Don't Buy,You can do better. I have been doing the aquarium heater musical chairs for a few months here and this is no good.
5,Exactly What I Needed,"I'm a college student and on a budget, so when I needed a new heater for my fishtank, I went for the best at the lowest price. Unfortunately, I have a 30gal tank, so I was wary about this purchase. I did it anyways, and I am extremely pleased with the results! Even with a 30gal tank, this heater works and keeps the water at a steady temperature."
3,Needed a different type of heater,"This heater worked fine, but I needed a heater that could be submersed completely due to the low water level in my aquatic turtle tank. It had to be positioned vertically and the water had to be up to a certain minimum point (not completely submersible), which made the water level much higher than what I wanted. I ended up requesting a refund and then ordered a Fluval U1, which is perfect for my needs. If you can have a higher water level (i.e. for fish), this Hydor heater would be great, though."
4,Good but not for large tanks...,"I love the versatility of the heater, it saved my betta in his 2.5 gallon tank when he had a case of ick I had to raise temperature to above 82F. The little heater did manage to get the water up to 84, but not quite the 87 it is designed to do.It truly is submersible, I now have it sitting on the bottom of the tank in the gravel.It works great in the 2.5 gallon tank but given how hard it was to go above 84F, I think it would not be sufficient for 5 gallon tank. You might want to get two though.Overall I am very happy with it and my Betta loves it."
4,Hydro THEO for 3 Gallon,"I had yet to find a good heater that kept my 3 gallon tank at a constant temperature. I had tried the Marineland Stealth for up to 3 gallon, and it made my tank reach ~82F. This has a dial, so it takes a little time to get it just right, but once you do, you will not have to adjust it.Cons. I have noticed it seems some of the black paint/labeling on the outside of the heater has begun to flake off.I would recommend this to anyone..."
1,Wanna cook your fish?,"I have a 12 gallon tank. I needed a new heater as my old 50 watt visi-therm gave out after 8 years of use... (I put my hand in the tank the other day and promptly received an electric shock which prompted me to buy this product).I set the temperature to 75 degrees F, put this heater into the water, double-checked the temperature of the water (also 75 degrees F) and did some things around the house. Four hours later, I checked the water temperature and it was 83 degrees F while the heater was STILL TURNED to 75 degrees.I cannot trust this heater to work properly.Returning it asap."
2,Consistently inconsistent,"I have used this heater to heat my top-off water (3-5 gallons at a time) and for a 7 gallon quarantine tank.For the top-off, this thing is all over the map regardless of temperature setting. The only way to get the water consistently above 72F is to turn it up all the way. Yes, this is WITH circulation.For the QT, I have to turn it all the way up and cover the tank to limit evaporation. Even in total blackout the temp ranges from 74-75.5F.I'll keep it for my top-off bucket since exact temp isn't vital, but I won't buy another of these."
3,NOT GOOD FOR SMALL TANKS!,"This heater works really well - but it gets too hot for a 1 gallon tank. I'm not knocking the product, just warning fellow shoppers to look for something less powerful if you have a 1 or 2 gallon tank. This heater raised my 1 gallon tank by about 15 degrees in just a few hours, even on the lowest possible temperature setting. Poor fishy!"
4,It's good,"I have this in a fry tank and it maintains a constant cozy 80*F range. My only complaint is the dial is a little difficult to turn which some people might like but, I happen to not other then that it is a good heater."
3,Good little heater,"I am really picky about heaters. My favorite brand is OLD ebo jagers (true submersible). Which now, are getting harder and harder to find, and older.Plus, I couldnt find a small one (I needed this for a 2.5gal pico reef).For a 25w this heater is pretty petite. Hydor theo does own one of the few heaters marketed still as FULLY submersible, which is amazing. There was some big deal over fully submersibles about 10 or so years back.The Theo looks nice, performs well, I feel the plastic temp changer feels a bit cheap, but it has stood up over time.It did strugle sometimes heating my tank (it should not have struggled heating a 2.5g)"
3,Kind of let down,"Belkin has a great name for quality, so I was disapointed to see they are made in China. They didnt look anything differant from the cheapies. They work fine ,but I just expected better from Belkin who used to have a good reputation."
4,great mosquito repellant,"I work in my yard almost everyday and sometimes into the evening hours when mosquitos can eat you alive in a rural area. I keep the Mosquito Halo with the scent cartridges nearby and it works wonderfully. I can be as far away as 20 or 30 feet and the scent cartridge still works. Sometimes the mosquitoes find my ankles, but not often -- for that I wear socks. It's the best thing for sitting on the patio in the open air at night and no mosquito bites. I especially like not having to breathe the scent of citronella."
1,The order process is a disaster.,the order went to Park City and I wanted it to go to Minneapolis where I was in a hotel for 24 hours. I di not even push order. Could some one contact me.Roy Halstead rohalstead@aol.com
3,"Arrau yes, 1952 recording no","The playing is great. There's no arguing with that. Arrau is brilliant on this disc.But however good the playing is, I need decent sonics as well. Unfortunately, the technology available at the time of this recording pales markedly in comparison to today. Hiss is present during quiet bits, and there is distortion during loud bits. It's not out and out horrible, but it is very noticeable. I simply can't listen to the whole disc because of the sound.If you don't mind subpar sonics as long as the playing is great, don't hesitate to purchase this. On the other hand, if you're bothered by older (over 50 years at this point) recordings, take a pass."
3,This isn't really Prefuse 73 anymore,"I absolutely loved Prefuse 73's old albums. Things have changed in this album. Songs like perverted undertone are replaced by a little more artist flavor. Personally, I'm not a big fan, and am a little dissapointed that this album didn't sound like his last two."
2,BE FOREWARNED,"A lot of the people reviewing this album, both on Amazon and elsewhere, don't realize the deceit behind this release. Warp Records and Prefuse 73 try to pass it off as a ""new album"", but quite a few of the tracks have been previously released. Many of them are remixes Prefuse has done for other artists, simply re-appearing here as ""collaborations"" with new titles, but are actually completely re-hashed. (He did this at least once on his previous album too). Other tracks here marked as ""featuring"" someone (such as The Books) are actually just Prefuse raiding the artists' back catalog and sampling it, clearly without any input from the original artist.To top it off, this album as a whole just isn't that great, and certainly not up to the standard's of Prefuse's previous albums. He tries to cram too many ideas into one song, and it sounds watered down, as if he's on ""auto pilot"" mode. If you want original, sincere, or challenging music, look elsewhere."
1,Hip Hop producer,"I was fooled into thinking this is some good electronic music since it is on Warp. Be warned, this is hip hop. Sure the beats are creative and the music is better than most hip hop, but it's got little depth and in the end, it's a hip hop beat. Sometimes the music is not horrible but then an MC starts talking on top of it and you can't hear the music any more. It's a shame to have this on a legendary label like Warp."
1,Save Your Money,"A 10 dollar bar of soap shouldn't leave your skin dry. You're spending your money on how this thing looks. My 8 year old loves it, because it looks cool to him. But I didn't buy it for him, I bought it for me. And trust me, I wish I would have saved my money and bought something else."
5,Excellent Book,Best Bible Study I've Done Recently. This is not too hard or bookish. Fun! I love the ARNF's!
2,SAME feature not working correctly,"S/N 70802840PH.There's currently a Tornado Watch issued in my county (019163), but the WATCH indicator light on my radio display is not working. I changed the setting from SINGLE COUNTY to ALL COUNTIES, and still nothing. Everything else works fine. Not sure if my unit is defective, or if I'm doing something wrong. Sent a note to Emerson's online 'help' page. Giving them 2 days to advise before I take the unit back to the store (Target)."
2,"It's OK, bad support though.","I bought one of these for myself. A lot of functionality and it's good to have the weather alerts. However the digital clock isn't easy to read and the clock alarm setting is cumbersome, required multiple button pressing to simply set the alarm. That said, I have gotten used to it and it does provide a lot of functionality in one unit.We had bought another one of these to give as a gift (given as a gift months after the purchase). The recipient told us the numbers on the clock weren't displaying completely so you couldn't tell the time. Sure enough, she was right. When I called Emerson to see about fixing it, they were no help and told me to go to a local electronics repair store. I'm sure that will cost more than the purchase price!!"
1,"Don't buy, unless you want to waste your money","We had such high hopes for this clock. When it arrived, the box looked as if it had been re-taped multiple times. We unpacked it to find a relatively new looking clock; however, when we plugged it in the numbers on the left side would not show up. The seller was far from apologetic. It cost us nearly half the cost of the clock to return it and it took the seller over a month to credit us for the clock and this was only after we reminded the seller."
4,Great Radio!,"Once you get this radio set up, it's perfect! Keep the instruction manual handy just in case you forget how to do an activity. The manual is very simple to use and setting up the SAME technology for storm warnings is great! I would recommend this alarm to anyone that is in need of storm warning- especially if you are in the Midwest."
2,Blinking Lights,"I purchased one of these radio/clocks several years ago. Not long after I got it programmed and started using it, the 3 lights on the right hand side of the clock started to blink on and off; and still do to this day. I called their ""help"" line, but they did not know how to make the lights stop blinking."
4,Great but...,"This sunshade fits like glove, but it fits so good that there is no way to get it in without banging the mirror. Otherwise it's great. Will update later to comment on how it holds up.After using this everyday for the past 6 months or so, it still looks brand new. This thing has a silver/metallic surface that looks like it'll hold up as long as you own it."
4,A step beyond a textbook,"I was reading before I started kindergarden and wanted to write since junior high. I lost all confidence in myself with the beauty of the books around me. ""I'll never be that good,"" I constantly told myself and the difficult nature of most writing instructional books only made it worse. They were so complicated and hard to understand for the beginning writer. Then I was introduced to Michael Crawley's How to Fail As a Novelist and it was life changing. He explains how to write by the mistakes new writers make and he does it in such a humorous way that you never realize you are reading a 'textbook.' Where's my pen? I'm ready to start..."
3,"GREAT ALBUM, PITY ABOUT THE PRODUCTION!","More a damage limitation effort than anything else-this has been cleaned up from a cassette in John Jones collection after the mastertape and his guitars were stolen. A real pity because it if properly produced would of been as good as 'growing' which it is more similar to than their opus 'no alternative'. There is less mellotron which is a pity, but some nice miles like wah-wah trumpet and the usual intricate time changes. What is a surprise is there is more emphasis on melodies and catchy Beatle-ish chorus. It has a nice booklet, but is woefully short. It isn't unlistenable, but just sounds very flat."
2,eh kinda sucks,"I have many of his books but this one falls to the bottom of the list of ones to buy. Didn't really think it matched description and was more based on his personal life, opinions and religeous beliefs than anything. some parts were interesting. overall kinda boring though and like i said normally read his other books more than one time and benefit from them, this one...worthless in one word."
1,borring book,"This book has very bad content. It doesn't really help at all. I'm a fan of lots of his books specially Men are from Mars.... and also Mars and Venus on a Date. But this, it was a disaster. I repent from buying this garbage. It works better for the chimney, I don't have one but I might consider building one to give this book some use."
1,"This book is about the New Age religion, not Mars & Venus.","I bought Practical Miracles for Mars & Venus under the assumption given in the title and John Gray's previous books that it was about male-female relationships. The title is very disceiving and I returned the book. The primary thrust is about John Gray's New Age religion and/or Hindu religion based on his nine years as a Hindu Monk. Any Muslim, Christian or Jew should be very offended at the material presented in this book. Shame Mr. Gray for your misrepresentation.Clark from Boulder, Colorado"
1,DESIGN NOT AS BRIGHT AND VIVID AS PHOTO,"I have been buying Corelle for over 30 years now. I am so disappointed in these dishes, I am out over $20.00 to ship these back! The design is not as vivid or bright and detailed as the photo suggest. If you can image looking at the photo provided thru a screen door, that is actually how it appears in person. Buyer beware, I do not know what has happened to Corning that makes the Crelle ware, but this is not the only pattern that appears this way in stores. Please look at the dishes, in another store in person, before taking the chance on purchase. Another American company that has lost its way, shame on you Corning................"
2,Not a good training tool,"I was hoping to use the video as a career training tool for high school kids. Unfortunately, it was more an amateur video from a mining site. There wasn't the variety of earth moving equipment that I anticipated, and the explosions didn't suit my purposes."
1,A Disappointment,"I thought this book would be just my cup of tea, as I am an aficionado of medical curiosities, but this is the dullest book, of this type, that I have ever read. I regret buying this book"
3,Disappointing Ending to Intruiging Series,"Hack Sign: Volume 6: Terminus contains the last three episodes of the fascinating cyber conspiracy-mystery anime series, plus two unrelated episodes. Many questions raised during the series were not answered to my satisfaction. Endings just happened too quickly. What should have been a well thought-out conclusion became smarmy - almost Disneyfied - in its lame preaching about love and friendship.The extras are lame as well. We have two unrelated episodes, one that tells us about Mimiru's mentor in the world, a mysterious, seemingly all-powerful female warrior. She has a crush on a college guy playing in the world. There are hints it could have been . . . Bear?The other extra episode is of clips of the series. I watched it, hoping it would answer some of my questions, but alas, I feel I have been logged off of the World before I was ready."
1,Sorry but the story and voice acting is just awful!,"Yes it is. I have watched all of the dvd's and this show is by far one of the worst!!! I dispise the voice acting!!! the story is awful!!! This show really does not deserve to be this famous! It has comics, anime, videogames, etc. etc. etc.!!! I advise everyone to skip .Hack entirely!!!I great anime I recommend would be Last Exile!!!"
2,Cought in endless loop,"I thought I was reading the same pages over and over again, one could have taken out the middle 50 pages (at least, the editor should have) and not miss a thing that furthers the plot (the heroine and the hero are attracted, fight it, make love, are attracted, fight it, make love, etc., etc.). Furthermore, Ms Martin feeds all possible clichés there are about the entire set of characters, it's almost funny (all cowboys are rugged, all women are feisty, even the horses are either powerful (male) or dapper (female). I just finish this book because I am too conscientious and I finish all the books, but I leave out two pages at a time and I do not know the difference."
2,Not impressed,"This was my first Kat Martin book and will probably be my last. I bought this book after reading all of the glowing reviews it got and boy was I disapointed! The characters had potential but the authuor chose to focus on the mystery instead. The drama was not believable, I mean how many accidents can possibly happen to one group of people over the course of a summer?It seems like every book I pick up recently is a romantic suspense and some of the authors just need to write romance stories and stop wasting their time and mine with mediocre crime drama."
5,Desert Heat by Kat Martin,We enjoy her writing style. She does an excellent job of holding your attention throughout the story with just the right amount of intrigue.
3,Passive / aggressive,"I had read the first book of this series and didn't really enjoy it, but thought this one might be better because of the plot. At first, I couldn't understand why I did not enjoy reading this book. I struggled just to finish. The story was good. The writing was good, but I just didn't ""feel"" as though I was there in the book. Once I finished reading, I knew why I didn't enjoy the book; I just didn't connect with the characters at all. The characters were shallow, didn't have any depth and were passive / aggressive, which was annoying. The author just skimmed over the sub-characters so they remained a mystery even though they are a large part of the story. I gave it three stars just because the story had potential. As I read this book, for some reason I kept thinking of high school..."
3,Just Okay for me,"I liked the premise of this story, and even the relationship with Dallas and Patience. I loved watching the friendship of Patience and Shari, her travel companion. The life on the road was an interesting on to read about, the ups and downs and from town to town. The hang out and friendships that are made over the years. I was a bit put off by Dallas' sleeping with other women but still having his mind on Patience. If he couldn't get her out of his mind, why the heck was he sleeping with anything that offered? And I didn't really understand why he was so annoyed that she was getting her Ph.D. That was a big point of contention with them, and I don't see the issue. All in all, I thought it was an ok book, I am on the other hand, looking forward to reading her sister's book."
2,Soooo Predictable,"I have enjoyed reading Kat Martin books for years. It is so disappointing to see a good author become so preditable. There were no surprises in this book, and really who cares about the great great grandma and the long ago murder that she solves. I agree with a previous reviewer that she never developed her characters. Plus I really got tired of reading the same thing over and over again: We are from different worlds and love is just not enough.Don't waste your money on this one, buy it used if you really want to read it. I know it is one I will be turing into a used book store, and I collect her books."
4,Enjoyable,"I look for Kat Martin books all the time, my sister introduced me to Kat's writing. I really enjoy her stories."
3,OK,I sent for the book after having watched the fantastic wonderful miniseries and the book didn't compare to the script writing of the series. Maybe my problem was having seen the miniseries first. I didn't feel the writing was near as good as the series. The story itself is good about the two sisters and their rise to fame through many struggles and twists and turns.
1,Insight into the building code bureaucracy,"Well, that should've been the name of the book. If you're looking for advice on working within the building code bureaucracy, this book might be for you. If you're looking for advice on building according to code, you need to look elsewhere. It does give insight into the mind of the inspector, admitting permits are for taxing and taking glee on setting the attorney general on a citizen who was trying to prevent the inspector from trespassing on his land. I bought the book hoping to get a concise guide to the code, but was mistaken."
2,Missing key information,"There is a very important section of the UBC titled Conventional Light Frame construction (ch23 Div IV), which allows a designer/builder to build a house without requiring expensive engineering. This book virtually ignores it, which I feel does a great disservice to readers. Many (most?) magazine house plans do not include braced wall requirments, which are part of the above building code. It would be nice if this book addressed this important section of the UBC. Also, it seems every time I have a building question and go to this book as a reference, it leaves me dissapointed. For example, requirements regarding grading and setbacks from slopes, etc., which can be pretty cryptic in the UBC. OK for general reading, but not a great reference book."
4,Internationally Induced Thoughtful Pop,I was pleasantly surprised by this CD. Don't let the French language become a barrier to buying it. All of the tracks are rich with various cultural influences and meters. Rachel Du Bois has a beautiful and powerful voice. The accompanying band is extremely tight. And the whole CD is very well produced.
2,Dissappointed,I am a huge death cab for cutie fan and I was really looking forward to seeing this as I love artistic music videos but I must say I just did not get almost any of these videos. I have yet to watch all of them but the ones I have seen were the ones recommended by others and I just don't think they were particularly note worthy. They don't seem to have anything to do with the music or the story in the songs. They are just weird 'artistic' amateurish videos shot in poor quality with mostly bad editing.
3,Nice looking but...,I ordered this ring about 4 months ago. I like the styling and it's very comfortable to wear but about two month after owning this ring the black inside the crosses started to peal. I only have about four complete crosses let. Detracts from the initial beauty of the ring.
3,Mixed,"Well, the ring is great! Looks really good and it is really strong which is why I bought the titanium. The only bad thing is that the paint is already chipping off after 1 month. Other than that this ring is wonderful! Great gift idea!"
5,Dale,"I used this product many years ago and was pleased with the results but it was only available mail order from TV infomercials. I have always had a white smile but in the last year, I drank coffee daily and noticed my smile was dull and much less white. I tried many of the store bought teeth whiteners and bleaches with little success. I found this product through an Internet search and received it within a few days. I saw a difference from the very first application and have used it for eight days now. I am very happy with the results and I feel that if stains are the reason for teeth being dingy looking, then this product will help."
4,Using 4 over 10 years.,"I have used this product since it was called Rapid White Pro. It has worked great to keep up the whitening that I had professionally done on my top teeth and really improved my bottom teeth (which I did not have professionally done). I don't have a problem with sensitivity so I use it for a lot longer time than recommended which might help it to keep them white. I use it every 6 months or so. I would recommend it, just make sure you get the gel in the front and all the down towards the bottom of the teeth."
5,Quick and very effective,"Natural White Pro doesn't hurt my teeth and lasts forever. I only have to do it once twice for 10 or 15 minutes to see big improvements. I've been looking for it for a long time, and I haven't liked anything else I've tried. Whitening strips make me sick to my stomach, and other gels are too slick to stay put on my teeth. I'll be getting more of this.The dentists office uses high levels of hydrogen peroxide, but it's possible to find high levels at retail prices. You just have to do some research. I don't remember if Natural White Pro has dentist's-office levels but it must have higher than average, or I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have bought it in the first place."
3,Not as effective as Watts Power White,"I used Watts Power White on my upper teeth and decided to try this product for my lower teeth. My upper teeth are noticeably whiter by about three shades using Watts after about three weeks, but I haven't noticed much difference using Natural White.In addition, my teeth are already whiter than the lightest shade comparison chart from Natural White. My teeth also seems to be slightly more sensitive after using Natural White.The paste for Natural White is much thick than the Watts gel, but the rinse is thinner than Watts mineral gel. The rinse does freshen breath but not sure it does anything for teeth.In conclusion, I would recommend Watts Power White over Natural White."
4,Good for a start,Good Book complete with soft wear forthe novice. Software is a bit dated but stilluseful for chart work.
1,Unremarkable,"The book is fine, the writing rather unappealing, and the CD doesn't add much. There are plenty of websites that you can get the same information for free."
5,Finally Donna Loren's Beautiful Ballad on CD!!!!,"This is a great CD with lots of memories of the 60's. I bought this CD for the original recording of Donna Loren's ""It only hurts when I cry"" I love girls from the 60's!!! Well worth purchasing the cd for Donna Loren!!!"
5,beach music,I am a big fan of beach music and these is one of the best cds i recommend for everyone its good musicLInda
2,Chocoloate Maple Cream Cookies,I ordered 7 boxes of cookies. A few arrived containing broken cookies and at least 1 box was stale.
4,Great cookies but bad services,"Place an order last week of April got a notified email that order was shipped on May 1st to Haiwai. Expected to receive by Mid May but got the cookies yesterday 6/11/2008. Also received the wrong items, I ordered Chocolate Maple cookies but the items received was maple cookies eventhough the packing list shows chocolate maple. Will never order from these company again."
3,A matter of luck?,"I bought several of this card, this time I got 2 and 1 did not work, some time it accept data, some time it doesn't. A reliability issue...or just a bad luck?Generally this brand is ok for the price but if the quality is dropping, is better to put more money and get something that work 100% of the time."
4,Inis Beag: Isle of Ireland,"This anthropological study is written colourfully and is very descriptive in the diverse matter that it covers. It is easliy read and at the same time is an enjoyable experience. After spending a year of study there myself, it brought back many wonderful memories, as well as ideas for further research. It is warm and charming, as well as accessible for the college student or interested reader of Irish culture."
4,An Old Guide to Writing with Feeling and Style,"I was reading Sidney Cox's 'Indirections' again. I read it every few years when I want to get a fresh perspective on writing. Cox was a close friend of Robert Frost for forty years. His thoughts on writing are those of a poet more than a prose writer, but he addresses both. The style of the book is a little offputting at first, but once you sense the cadence of the language, it soars with Cox's take on the art of composition and the things it takes to be a good writer. If you want to write the next bestseller, this book isn't for you. If you do want to be a good and thoughtful writer, don't miss out on this small, wise book. ( I give it four stars simply because the writing style is a little difficult at first. It's closer to a 4.75 with me.)"
5,"Brilliant peformances, amazing sound for mono","I first heard sections of the Tchaikovsky concerto on NPR a couple years ago, and was immediately struck by the emotional involvement as well as the talent which Francescatti shows here. This set of five violin concertos is a part of the Sony/Columbia Masterworks Heritage series, and the performances, all from the early 1950's, have been lovingly remastered in truly beautiful mono sound. There's none of the boxiness or closed-in feeling one sometimes hears in mono recordings, nor is there any detectable surface noise. Instead, you hear waves of warm, rich sound which suit the performances perfectly.The package includes photos of the original covers of the LPs, as well as informative notes about Francescatti."
5,Longtime N.E. OHIO SPORTS FAN,"I disagree totally with the guy from Chicago. The book presents all kinds of new details about legendary Cleveland sports events. And half the stuff happened way before I was born. What's cool about this book is that it doesn't read like a typical sports book. The author puts the sports stuff into the context of the times. When you read about the 1920 Indians, for example, you get a great feel for what the city of Cleveland was like at the time. And there's a lot of inside stuff about recent events like the 1997 World Series. I thought the book was awesome and bought it for several family members."
1,BNC connector,"It did not connect well (or at all, actually) with the tuner that I bought it for. It would not stay put.Back to the dipole antenna."
3,Too big had to return it,"Product is great but it runs big, I hard to return it I normally wear 3xl but I figured with a jacketc let me get more room. Bought 4x and it was huge, the 3x would have been great. Delivery was fast, the return was pricey and annoying for me. Best bet when buying clothing via the web you really need to check the stores to try it on."
4,"Well Made, Durable, Easy to Assemble, Made in USA","Using it to store garden things. Shipped on time, good packaging, no damages. Downloaded & read installation instructions beforehand. Well written except for a few typo errors, easy to follow, good diagrams. Assembled by myself in 2 hrs. with just a rubber mallet. Most important is to make sure it is on level ground or the doors will no close correctly. The manual notes this several times. I did a lot of researching for a good shed for a long time. It paid off. This is a good product made in USA. I would buy another shed from this company & highly recommend it."
2,Can't clean it,"The advertising blurb says it's maintenance free but that's not really true. I live in northern Maryland which gets a variety of weather. I have my unit placed beside a row of Leland Cypress trees which provides some shelter. This should be good but it isn't because the trees allow dirt, chlorophyl, and bird droppings to collect.The problem is that you can't clean it. I've tried almost every commercially available cleaner including Chlorox Cleanup and a strong detergent solution of ammonia. The soil seems to have been absorbed into the plastic. I've been working at it for a total of 4 days now and it still isn't clean. Unfortunately, there is no indication of what kind of plastic it is so there's no way to determine how to clean it.It works well; I've had an electric lawnmower, a professional edger, and other items in it for several years with no problems - except that it is an unsightly eyesore! I would never buy another one by this manufacturer."
4,Great for workshops,I bought my tape recorder to record workshops that I attend. I put the recorder next to the speaker (with their permission)and I got very clear results. I tried recording from the back of the room one time when I arrived late and my results were very disappointing. (Speaker did not have a microphone)
4,"Handy, good price, but feels like a toy","I waited to find a good price for this 1Gig digital recorder, and found it on Amazon. It's easy to use and the recording quality is clear. I also like the fact that it's USB-enabled and doubles as a data storage and transfer device. That's one less item I have to carry with me. Moving a recording file to my PC and playing it was simple and straightforward. After using it several times, I conclude that it has a very cheap feel to it, the action buttons aren't solid. For a man with average to large hands and fingers, it's difficult to operate because it is so very thin. Its fallen from my hand more than once while using it."
2,OK,"This is OK for some voice recording. It can also store data files.The first big problem I had with this was it would switch off onits own, even with new duracells. It would stay on for around 15minssometimes then turn off.The noise and clicking if it is touched or held is a little tiring butwhen it's on it is quite useable.Next purchase will be a more reliable pro model."
5,"I tested 10 similar items, this one came out on top","I compared the sound quality, recording options, audio limiting circuit and other key aspects of practical usage on this and almost a dozen similar models. None but the 320 had high quality recording along with high quality microphones. All the others were lacking in one or both areas. If you just want a speech recorder, don't bother. But if you need something that sounds great with singing or music as well as speech, look no further. CD-quality is not just a boast with this one."
1,Too tiny for older eyes and fingers,Even with reading glasses the display was too small for me to easily read and all the controls are too small. Recording was extremely sensitive - the mic picks up the sound of pushing the recording buttons. I was hoping that this would be a good choice to record band practice - for rehearsal purposes - but it is not. I returned it
4,Small Nice recorder,Very easy to use. Sound quality is ok if placed close to speaker. if in pocket or at a small distance sounds very muffeled.
4,Voice Recorder for live music,"I bought this to use to record my rock & blues band at gigs and practice. It was easy, recorded well without any distortion, but when played back through a stereo, revealed little bass. After EQ, it sounds pretty good, but is a low output unit. I ended up with the DS-40, better for what I use it for.As a music player, this was very cool with an Equalizer and plenty of memory. Great for a voice recorder or mp3 player, gets a B- for recording bands live."
3,good voice recorder/mp3 player,"I think it is a bit expensive for what it is - a quality voice recorder. But it doubles nicely as an mp3 player, which is fantastic. However, the interface for music is pretty bleak, it is obviously a voice recorder first. I like the fact that the voice recording is in stereo; although, I am not sure why that is useful - if you are looking to do good stereo recording, I would purchase the exterior mic to go with it. The AAA battery is really really lame - they really couldn't figure out a re-chargeable battery approach? Overall, not bad, but I would think only a small crowd would be interested in this."
2,Olympus WS-320M,"The Voice recorder meets all my expectations and moreEasy to use, easy to transfer great results"
1,Total Junk,"I have used the Olympus WS-100 and was impressed with that unit. So I upgraded to this WS-320M for more memory and features. But the genuises at Olympus redesigned the location of the USB plug in relation to the plastic housing of the unit - so now it doesn't fit into my computer (a Gateway). The front of the computer tower conflicts with the side of the Olympus' case.Unless your USB ports are not obstructed by any side protrusions from the tower case itself, don't waste your money on this garbage."
1,wow. almost mediocre,"Four positions for microphones, but you can only take advantage of two, because the recorder is incapable of resting vertical. That's right... you have to lay it down and cover up the ""feature"" of having mic ability in all directions.Sound quality is mediocre, at best.Software? no. It's a no frills recorder with the price of a frills recorder. For this price, it should be bluetooth enabled, or possibly have sound editing software. Or a FF Rv option... even if the next chapter button was to go in 5, 10, or 30 minute increments.Plastic... cheap plastic. One of the worst places I've put a hundred dollars. Do not buy this. Getting the less expensive model and it will hold up better, and perform at least as good."
4,Pretty Cool Little Tool,"I bought this Dictaphone for my boss, who travels extensively. First of all, I found it on Amazon for over $100 less than the average retail price. It arrived quickly, and when I gave it to him, he was thrilled with it. It's tiny enough to fit in his shirt pocket without being noticed, but stylish enough for him to want to show it off. The hidden USB jack was especially cool.I want one for myself now!"
3,Almost a great product,"The recorder is great - lots of memory and records well for a tiny device. Playback in both voice and music mode is a total pain. Quality is fine, but one's ability to navigate is terrible. For example, there's no true FF, just a quirky speedup feature that goes around 3X record speed. Should you accidently press FF or RW twice, which is easy, you're at the end or begining of the file and screwed. Also, the device doesn't work connected to your computer. For me, this is a big shortcoming when my only battery goes flat, say. When plugged in, it acts just like a flash drive. Lastly, the battery went down on me one time and I lost two interviews-not sure why, because other times I didn't looose files. Lastly, lastly, its kinda fragile and quite tiny - not for the clumsy. And, the ear phones aren't good for music-no low end unless you cram them into your ears."
2,The unbearable hiss kills it.,"I share all of Adlevision's concerns about the Olympus WS-320. I bought it assuming it must be a sensational improvement over the Olympus DM series, only to discover that it is inferior! Yes, it is awesome that it can record for 35 hours in high quality stereo instead of 2.25 (so you can store an entire project on it), doubles as an MP3 player and pulls apart to plug directly into the USB port without an extension. However, the background hiss, regardless of the mode you are recording in and the distance of the recording source, kills it for any serious work. (At first I thought it was my fault -- I must be using it incorrectly). I do not need it as an MP3 player, I already have an iPod. The cosmetic changes are only that. I am quite dissapointed. Back to the DM-10. Stick to what works well."
2,"Good features, bad plastic case","A beautiful product with alot of features from Olympus however worked for only 3 months after purchase date. Why:1. Plastic case - Because of the plastic case you cannot store this device in tight places (pants pockets) or places with vibration which caused my unit to fail after only 3 months. This isn't a rugged design.2. It's very tiny - This makes the unit more fragile especially with a plastic case.3. The tiny built-in speaker magnet will attract ANY metal crumbs and is very difficult to remove them from the tiny holes, which will result in audio noise/distortion during playback by speaker.Also voice record-to-playback navigation is cumbersome - It's difficult to go from recording to seeking for playback.Overall: This unit works well under intensive care but will fail in harsh conditions because it is so fragile. It is pricey too. At $200.00 Olympus failed to replace my unit and all music, lectures, and data was lost."
5,Man's next best friend,"-Easy to use.-Excellent Quality-Convenient.-Mucho features.-About the size of an Ipod Nano.-Voice to digital output is a snap.-1 complaint is that the battery is not rechargable, but despite that 1 'AAA' battery will take you far."
5,Great Product,"If your child is a dinosaur train fan, you will not be disappointed with this video. If your child is not a dinosaur train fan, he/she will be after this video. This show is so educational and fun!"
4,Great product,I bought this for my friends daughter. She loves Dinosaur train and will watch it again and again. Jim Henson creative.
5,Instinct For Freedom,"Alan Clements' newest book ""An Instinct For Freedom"" is a crystal clear distillation of dharma essence from a life lived wide open. Here are the stepping stones to the heart of freedom. Here is the doorway to an enormously rich life. A life so inspiringly shared, it's revolutionary. A must read!"
4,Mother of a Sensory Kid,"This book is a good primer for parents of kids with sensory processing disorder. Book is organized well and is an easy read. The book describes the characteristics of this disorder in segments which makes it easy to use it as a reference guide. The book does not offer a lot of ideas to help with sensory diet (keeping your kid happy and meeting his/her needs)--for that I recommend, Out-of-Sync Child Has Fun."
2,"Good information, but now what?","This book was okay. It made me feel better about my son (recently diagnosed with PDD-NOS and very clearly has some SID issues as well.) I liked the stories and how they broke down the information into symptoms of auditory SID, visual SID, tactile SID, etc.But I came away from reading this saying, ""now what?"" The only treatment plan I feel like this book gives is to seek out an occupational therapist. Um, I can't afford to pay $2,000 a month for treatment. I also felt like there was very little help ideas for kids with auditory SID.It was a good read and kept my interest well enough. The information was presented clearly (if dryly.) But... now what?"
2,Not effective,It works for serving but is not particularly useful for keeping the contents warm. It does look nice.
2,"So, So",Not liking this product much. The main reason is it has no base to catch the drops when you pour so you almost always are spilling a little when you pour. Keeps sauce warm but you can do better.
4,Impressive Views of the Most Important and Notable Spans,"Bridges: A History of the World's Most Famous and Important Spansthis book is not a comprehensive coverage of bridging history nor of engineering development; it is something far more than a routine catalog either.It aspires to more than those goals.Instead it intends to show major works through the centuries. The format is double landscape so that each structure ia covered on two facing pages equivalent to that of four standard 11 x 8 1/2 landscape format. This format allows the widest possible imagery to be used. Since many modern bridges have no walkways or perhaps one day a year for a bridge walk, these views can seldom be experienced by the every-day passerby or the enthusiast.All in all it fulfills its goals of inspiring and encouraging the enthusiast while highlighting the major works through the centuries."
3,A bridge lover,"I was a little disappointed in this book in that it really doesn't get into much detail about any of the bridges which are discussed. It's more of a ""coffe table"" book without out much informative depth. Nothing to really sink your teeth into. However, if you're not already familiar with any of the bridges covered in the book, or you're not a nut for bridges, then this book is a great introduction to a few of the most beautiful bridges to be seen. One neat thing that I did really like is that it is a very wide book which allows you a little better perspective of the true size of some of the bridges - you get long pictures instead of little ones of each bridge. That was kind of cool! My 5 yr old son loves ""reading"" this book to me!"
3,Nice,"It was much smaller than we anticipated on arrival but still a nice gift for my daughter. She liked it, all that matters."
4,A wonderful gift,"My boyfriend bought me this necklace as an anniversary gift two years ago. Since then, the chain has broken and the back of the pendant has turned copper. The pendant itself is one sided, the back of the pendant is flat. The chain itself is a tiny chained necklace, and it lasted for the majority of the time that I've had it. I don't quite remember how it broke, but it had some force to it, so the chain itself is very sturdy. Also considering I never take it off. As for the pendant, I assume only the chain and the front of the pendant is sterling silver. As I stated the back of my pendant now is copper or rusted. I did try to buff it out with a sterling silver rag, only the front of the pendant gleamed. I'm incredibly attached to this necklace though and I do encourage you to buy it. It's exactly like the picture, it's perfect. :]"
3,NIce gift,I ordered this for my sister's birthday. Beautiful and great quality.... Overall I was pretty happy with the item and she loved it! The heart pendant was a bit smaller than I expected but you can still appreciate the detail.
3,The Chicago Defenders not a reputable source for consciously written manuscripts,"R. Turner does a fair job with book until he comes to Noble Drew Ali his entire frame of referrence comes from the Chicago Defender. A paper known for it's sensationalizing untrue stories of lurid sex and perverted crimes to sell more papers. Unfortunately it has been 70 years since D Ali's death and over a 100 since his birth and the Defenders articles are some of the only remaining sources of the time of D Ali on the earth plane, therefore the Defender unfortunately is one of the sources to satisfy the public's hunger for knowledge of this mysterious and great man. I would recommend the book ""The Huevolution of Sacred Muur Science Past and Present"" by Noble Timothy Myers-EL for a more objective commentary on the life of Drew Ali in chapter v."
1,Extremely boring book,"Extremely boring book. Filled with the usual ""don't overtrade"", ""always use a stop"" and other ""secrets"" and blah blah blah...I could not find ANYTHING of value inside this soporific book. Your money could be better used elsewhere, don't spend it on this useless book unless you suffer form chronic insomnia."
2,BAD BOOK,"DESDE MI PUNTO DE VISTA, CREO QUE ES UN LIBRO CON MAS DE LO DE SIEMPRE. CREO QUE NO APORTARA ALGO RELEVANTE."
5,"The Confed is falling down, falling down.","Khadaji and the Matadors are now in direct conflict with the Galactic Confederation. Marcus Wall, the power behind the President of the Confed, is a master of plans within plans and will do whatever it takes to stay in, or at least near the center of power. But Khadaji is also a master, and his goal is to bring down the Wall, and the Confed along with him."
5,Can't wait until book 3.,Phenomenal! I've become so involved with the characters that they almost become a part of me as I'm reading Harrison's books. I read the first trilogy two times -- the first time I've ever reread anything. Each of Sue Harrison's books ends too soon. What a great escape for me! The storytelling is incredibly vivid and I have learned so much about these ancient people. Could anyone recommend a writer of Sue Harrison's caliber that writes about prehistoric cultures? Please email me.
2,This time around the story is darker.,"The people in this book need to lighten up! No one appears to be happy or friendly or in the mood for anything but well..being angry. Waxtal has come back from the ""Dancing Lights"" in the form of that woman who's only driving thought is retribution. Another woman has to live away from her people and learn to survive, Samiq/Kukutux ring a bell? At one point a child is cuffed for getting some food out of the village cooking bags by an old woman, whereas in the first series, food was gladly shared even when there was so little.I found that I really could care less what happens to this glum, moody bunch. I hope in the next book people cheer up and find a reason to smile!"
2,Produces poor sound quality,I purchased this bow to replace a standard Glasser fiberglass bow. I am very dissapointed in the fact that the fiberglass bow produces a much better sound than this bow. I am returning the bow.
4,Most of the Best of Ratt,"This book is great and very accurate. If your good at invoking emotion into your fingers onto the strings, then your going to sound just like Warren D. Martini, which is kind of a rush. Like EVH, he puts a lot of emotion into his sound and that's what makes the difference. Way Cool Jr. is one of my fav's along with Lay It Down. They did leave out some very great songs, like Giving Yourself Away and Nobody Rides For Free. A few more songs and I would have rated this book a 5*. You can't beat the price for some of the best guitar work of the 80's. If your into soaring and emotion pulling guitar work, then you must definitely add this to your collection..."
2,Poor Medicine,"Cohn uses a series of mini case-studies to illustrate problems within American healthcare. Examples include overcrowded ERs, loss of job-based health insurance, medical debt being the leading cause of bankruptcy, scam insurance policies, high insurance overheads (advertising, selective recruiting, insuring policy adherence), and the moral dilemmas of providers being paid more for poor quality (rework) than good.Single-payer coverage for all would make much more sense, especially if combined with changes to reduce poor care (encourage specialization/""practice makes perfect,"" adherence to respected treatment and diagnosis guidelines) and unneeded care (see Wennberg's research on variations in medical practice). These savings, combined with existing costs that are currently hidden (uncompensated care) would result in both better care and lower costs. Unfortunately, Cohn does not make those connections."
3,Health Scare,The premise is sound but the stories are anecdotal and do little but inflame an already impassioned debate in this country -- Can we afford our current healthcare system? The book added nothing new to this discourse. If you're a novice about healthcare this might help frame the discussion but you could do better -- Steve
3,I'm sick of it,"Everyone has an opinion. I've been a family practice physician now for 30 years, and see the situation from the patient, hospital and personal viewpoint. The best, most honest and straight forward written information I've seen comes from William C. Waters III, MD. The small book, or pamphlet, called ""2 days that ruined your health care"", came from AAPS. I ordered 30 more copies, and my hospital administrator ordered 100, to give to board members and interested others. Unfortunately, I'm afraid there is irresistible political pressure insure more of the same."
3,The book stops before it gets to the hard part.,"The book is excellent as far as it goes but the book stops just when it is getting started. The anecdotes are interesting and tragic. The author convincingly makes the case for universal health care but does not say how it might work, what it would cost or how it would be paid for. He claims that perhaps the best universal health care system is to be found in France. He does not give many details. One wishes he had included a detailed comparison of existing health care systems around the world say in Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Japan. He should write a sequel giving the needed analysis."
4,as good as I hoped,"I shopped online for weeks before deciding. I have been borrowing Bissell carpet cleaners for a while, this one seems to be the best so far. Assembly was easy. It was a little heaver then I expected. I like the water resivoir, they have improved the seals & latches. The stairs are labor intensive, as the water shoots out very concentrated & it takes a lot of work to get them dry. Maybe it just takes a while to get the hang of it. Overall, glad I bought it."
2,look good but...,"I had read all the reviews and having made what I thought was an informed decision i bought this floor cleaner and for the first day it worked great! I followed the instructions and the floor cleaner right afterwards, unfortunately when I went to use it the second day the floor agitators no longer functioned. When contacting Bissell I recieved nothing more than the help responses that were already in the instruction manual. Their only other suggestion is that I take it to one of thier repair centers. All I can say that after a great start with this Bissell product I end up feeling very disappionted."
2,Cleans but leaves warter drops behind,"We bought this model at [...] to replace our older model that is no longer working properly. We fired it up and started cleaning, only problem, it left water drops on the carpet. When I went back over the drops to remove them, the cleaner only dropped MORE water on the carpet. This was extrememly frustrating. I called the consumer center in the morning and we performed a couple of tests. He sugggested that I had a unit that was built on a Friday afternoon and to return it to [...].Based on our previous experiences with this brand, we purchased the item again. Just got done firing it up and its the SAME problem! Back to [...] it goes. I'm now looking at the Hoover.A couple of notes on this model verses our older Bissel ProHeat.1. New model no longer has an indicator that the water is spraying onto the carpet.2. While the new water reservoir is easy to remove and replace it is difficult to see the water and any pre treat used coming up through the cleaning chute."
2,Works good for as long as it works,"I've owned two of these. I don't shampoo often, but I like having my own cleaner when I do. The first one lasted about a year. Used less than a dozen times. The second one lasted about the same, with the same amount of use. I checked into having the first one fixed. It cost as much as buying a new one. I won't buy another Bissell cleaner."
4,"Better than the Hoover, but not the whole answer.","Prior to getting this cleaner, I was using a Hoover F7425-900 Dual V. After having leaks fixed twice, and knowing the attachments were useless because all of the water ended up on the floor instead of the tank, I finally decided on the Bissell ProHeat 2X Select. Overall, I like this machine. The tools work great and vacuumed water actually goes into the tank. It cleans the carpets really well, but leaves too much water in it so it takes forever to dry. Since the Hoover machine vacuums most of the water out of the carpet leaving it almost dry, I now use both machines (UGH, more storage space needed). I use the Bissell to do the cleaning and the Hoover to pick up the water. It sure would be great if someone would produce a machine that cleaned carpets, the tools worked, and the most of the water was removed from the carpet. Imagine, one machine that would do it all!!!! (Oh, I have another smaller cleaner for small jobs)"
1,Cute but unreliable,I was unable to find a place in my car where the surrounding metal didn't interfere with the accuracy. It did however work great on the kitchen table. Save your money for a GPS if you want accuracy.
1,going east,"Unless I have been driving eastward and only eastward for the past 2 days, this compass is useless. Wish that I had read the other review prior to my purchase."
5,Finding a rare gem,I bought this because it has Lillian Blauvelt on it and was thrilled. It is crackly but because the recordings were taken from a wire recorder. Lillian is a family reletive and we wanted to preserve her achievments for our children and generations to come. Thank you so much!
1,...I mean because women shouldn't even EXIST,"Equality is the radical notion that all people are valued members of society.I guess this product has never heard of such a notion. This product (if any one had the slightest bit of guts or taste) shouldn't be available especially on a site like this. Racism should be welcomed by no one including companies looking for a quick buck.Why I'm sure you can pick up many quality(inflatable doll) women with such a ""charming"" bumper sticker."
4,A sticky situation...,"It's tape. 'nuf said? Note that this is the REMOVABLE tape, not permanent. They also have a permanent, so if you want something that won't come off quite as easily, I definitely recommend the permanent stuff. This is removable, so yes, it will come off (and rather easily). This stuff is pretty pricey, especially for how little of it is on there. Fortunately for me, it's one of those things where I just need a little piece of it here and there, so that's just fine. If you use more and want to save some dough, look into the 3-pack and/or the bigger rolls."
3,"Ok for paper on paper, but not paper on painted wall","Definitely doesn't work well for hanging posters on a wall. Lasted 10 minutes, then fell down. Works well for lightweight paper on paper."
1,Not sticky at all,"This tape isn't very sticky at all. It wants to be attached to a very specific surface, and didn't like my walls at all. I regret buying this tape."
4,Very Removable but NOT Very Strong,"I use this Double-Sided Removable Tape often, but only in situations where I do not need strong tape. It is a very useful addition to the arsenal of tape in my home. Typical uses: Tape a birthday card to a wrapped gift. Tape an Amex gift card inside a holiday card. Tape a reminder to the counter. I love the elegant look of double sided tape -- the tape is not visible at all.I would not use this to stick something on a wall -- not even a piece of paper. It is not strong enough for that. Maybe some day Scotch will create a stronger removable tape. I hope so."
5,Great buy,The best thing is it came right on time. I wanted to use it for nail art and my daughter. Works perfect real cheap then what I saw in stores
2,Confused Removable tape,"This product sounds like a good idea. But I think the double sided tape gets confused which side of the paper to stay on. When you remove it, the tape is stuck on the wrong side of the paper. I wish they make a product that says 1 side permanent and 1 side removable."
1,Disapointed customer,"VERY DISAPPOINTING PRODUCT!!!!!Nothing like described, the glue is so weak and cant be used on most surfaces, and above all not double sided !!DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT, ITS USELESS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,A good non- expensive book for ufo experts and ametures.,"I like d this book mainly for the fact that it had tons of information, and also that it did not cost a bundle of money. I have been reading about Ufos for some time now, and this one is one of my favorites on the subject. I strongly encourage you to read this book if you enjoy Ufo stuff ."
5,"GOD Send, MUST have if you own an RX-7","This is the most in depth book about manual repairs on the rx-7. when i was rebuilding my engine i had a shop look at it, thier shop manual from mazda gave almost no infromation, i showed them what i was using and than they borrowed my book to try to fix the car! I rebuilt this car from the ground up with my bare hands thanks to this book. great for begginers or advanced mechanics, when i started i had never turned a wrench in my life, this book gave valuable insight into many aspects of car mantaince in general along with specifics about the rx-7. I would give this 6 stars if they would let me!!!!!"
3,Bought for 13B info,A typical Haynes manual- decent but not completely comprehensive with weak drawings and diagrams but still way better than nothing.
5,1st release still the best,"From the Paul Kamanski penned opener ""Bigger Stones"" through a killer Lou Reed cover, originals and a couple of very amusing Country Dick vignettes, this is the Beat Farmers album to have. If you can only have one. But do try to get all their others."
5,"Long, lost, but not forgotten","This album simply rocks! All the way through. I had the great fortune to be a regular at Bodie's [World Famous Dive Bar]. The Beat Farmers were regulars on the stage. But they were not the only band to grace the tiny stage in that dark dingy bar. Imagine, if your mind still has the capacity, on any given weekend the likes of The Beat Farmers, Rockin' Roulettes, Mojo Nixon, Cindy Lee Berryhill, The Paladins, The Forbidden Pigs, DFX2, Tomcat Courtney, CowJazz, Joey Harris and the Speedsters and so many more, but they all played there and it was some of the best music on the planet! Buy this"
5,Gone but not...,"I remember seeing the Beat Farmers when they played at the ""Spring Valley Inn"" near San Diego, CA. The place was so small the band had to move the pool table in order to have room to play. This was the first album I can recall that they ever released. It is also their best. Spill some beer on your head and turn the volume up, it'll be almost like being there!"
3,Be Aware Of New Release,I was glad to actually get my hands on a new copy of this CD after my original casette tape bit the dust. I paid the higher than average price due to the lack of supply and being a rare CD to find. Surprise to find what I actually received was a 2004 re-release with bonus tracks not on the original release. I was happy to have the additional music but what bothers me is that is was represented as the original copy and not a new release. I could have bought this at my local Tower Records for a lower price.
4,Tales of Beaten path,"Beat Farmers were in the tradition of hard working bar bands that almost made it BIG, like Springsteen Van Halen B52s Doors Beatleswhoops! Those bands did..Why not Beat Farmers?They played with humor, heart, and heat, a hybrid of the best of Rock and Roll. Those who saw them live in a besotten bar with guys yelling and girls half naked witnessed the best part of this life.""Tales of the New West"" was almost their breakthrough LP. It had a Springsteen song, ""Reason to Believe"", that got some airplay on maybe a few FM stations. It was a novelty song, ""Happy Boy"" by drummer and deep voiced extrodinare Country Dick that was most played...unfortunately, only because People grinned but didn't buy.With ""Americana"" now a viable radio and music label, maybe Beat Farmers will be rediscovered. All their LPS, CDs are worthy, this one has the entire ""Tales"" + bunches of Demos and live rare. This is the most important Beat to be bought. At any cost."
5,Szell is excellent,A non-nonsense set of Schumann's four symphonies from one of my favorite conductors at the helm of a super orchestra. Szell never takes liberties. He makes these sing. Remastering is also well-done.
4,"Packaging comment, Sony must have fixed that item","I have always admired Szell's recordings so I am going to take my time to listen to all of these and compare with a few DDD recordings of more modern vintage of single symphonies. These are analog from the late 1958-1960. I just want to report that the packaging is without fault in my double CD,as much as one can expect for a single box,(flap type double- sided plastic insert) jewel box. The booklet insert is unusually complete and meets the usual Masterworks reputation with fun copies of early LP covers too. No cardboard. Amazon shipping process never ceases to wow. I am not a hi fi guru, but I will give these interpretations a good workout and make my comments on the recording quality and my views on same later."
5,Legendary Performances of Schumann Symphonies,"The original LP recordings of the four Schumann symphonies, Manfred Overture, and (sadly not included) Piano Concerto have been a benchmark for all others since they were first released in the late 50's, and for very good reason. The performances are simply magificent. Yes, Szell did make some adjustments in Schumann's original instrumentation to achieve better balances, but the results are always effective and musical. The Symphony No. 2 was a ""calling card"" piece for the Cleveland Orchestra and Szell on tour and you will never hear it more beautifully performed than you will on this recording. The SONY packaging is wonderful with plenty of vintage Szell photographs and an excerpt of a very articulate article written by Szell in support of Schumann's orchestral works. Buy this now; you won't regret it!"
5,simply irresistible,"although i've been a frequent listener to late german romantics school (i.e. wagner bruckner r.strauss), i wasn't particularly fond of early german romantic symphonies (i.e. schubert, schumann, brahms), but this set of schumann's symphonies by szell/cleveland simply draws me in a way only comparable to karl bohm and his schubert/mozart. in sum, this set is simply irresistible music... i have to say among szell's recordings with cleveland of beethoven, brahms, schumann, and bruckner, i value his schumann the most for its natural phrasing... as the booklet says, szell certainly has an affinity with schumann's music."
3,"Fishing for Brookies, Browns and Bows","This is a nice, readable book on fishing for trout. It is written as a narrative and is not a good reference book because you really can't find anything. Lots of fun anecdotes and you learn a good bit as you read. It also covers techniques other than fly fishing, which is an added plus. For those situations where fly fishing is difficult or impossible there are some very good tips on using other methods. Fly fishing elitists probably won't like this, but for those of us who adapt our methods to the conditions at hand the book offers some good insights. For winter reading when we are dreaming about the coming season, this will get the fires burning."
2,Pricey cable,"I accidentally ordered the wrong length (my fault). For $10 I thought it was 3 METERS, not 3 feet. Overpriced for what you get."
2,Didn't laugh once,"*Somebody* has to say it, you either get this movie or you don't, and you're not some kind of idiot if you don't. This movie just fell flat with me, it relied too heavily on cheesy, nonsensical wordplay, and the Marx brothers seem to have a standard, all-purpose delivery for every single joke: fast. The famous ""slow burn"" scene felt amateurish to me. The lauded ""anarchy"" in this movie strikes me as a lame excuse for sloppy editing and writing, I guess it's easier for a scene to lead into another with no segway at all, or for pun-oriented conversations to begin and end like a light going on and off, then to make your film cohesive. Really, this is not so much a movie as a string of miscellaneous gags with a VERY flimsy story to try to tie it all together. If you want an example of classic comedy intertwining elegantly with a story watch a Chaplin or Keaton movie.Shouldn't the Marx brothers be totally forgotten by now?"
1,These prices are a rip-off!,More than $$$$ for a Marx Brothers DVD! Insane! How does this happen? There must be 100s of thousands of people willing to pay a reasonable price for some of the greatest comic classics of all time?
3,"Amazing Family, But This Film Is Not For Adults -","Incredible that one family would have four comedy stars (actually three - the fourth had a very limited career). I loved watching Groucho's quiz show many years ago and all their movies. However, now many years older, this one is far too much slapstick for my taste."
3,"Great Movie, Ho-hum DVD","If I were only rating the movie, I would give it five stars. The mirror scene between Harpo and Groucho is classic (even if stolen from Charlie Chaplin) although I feel Lucy Ricardo's and Harpo's version in I Love Lucy was much better.The DVD itself was nothing to write home about. The video quality was ok without any noticeable streaks or splices from the original film. However, it could (and should) have been digitally remastered to sharpen the image and clean up the sound a bit. Also, there were no basic extras, other than a trailer, such as bios on the actors, out takes, nor a list of flubs one normally gets. I would have given the DVD four stars if it had been priced lower but for $17.95, it could have had some more extras. I do not believe any scenes or gags were cut (if ""All God's Chillin's Got Guns"" and the darky crack survived, I doubt they would have cut anything else)."
5,THIS MOVIE IS THE BEST!,"I think that Duck Soup is definately one of the Marx Brothers' most zany films. It contains so many of my favourite Marx sequences: the lemonade stand (that one's a classic!),the mirror scene, 'To War We Gotta Go',and the final battle episode that had my friends and I laughing for days! For any Marx fan this is definately a must-see, and it's a must-see for any non marx fan,too. And the quality of the picture on the VHS isn't all that bad, either."
5,The Greatest Comedy of All Time,"If you haven't seen this movie, you owe it to yourself to do so. If you haven't ever seen the Marx Brothers in action, you're missing out on some side-splitting laughter. The greatest comedy troup of all time; the Marx Brothers offered a trio of unique comedic skills. Start with Groucho and his acerbic wit. Insults fly like machine gun fire when Grouch has the floor. Chico offers the role of the person who finds new ways to mangle the English Language and misinterpret whatever you tell him. Harpo never speaks but his pantomime speaks volumnes. The way they play off each other is fantastic. This is not three clowns bumping into each other like the Three Stooges. This is humor that can be appreciated by all ages. Comedy these days always seems to fall short of the level achieved by the Marx Brothers. Either it is too high-brow, too low-brow, or too obscene. Watch this one because life is too short."
5,The funniest movie ever made,"Sure this gem sometimes changes places with Monty Python and the holy grail in the thick underbrush of my mind but the point is, like MP&THG I laugh EVERY time I watch this. Same jokes... Same set ups, I've watched it around 300 times... and I laugh. Groucho's arrival is genius... and although they didn't mean for it to be anything other than funny, the war sequence at the end is as powerfully anti-war as Dr. Strangelove or Full Metal Jacket. And very necessary in this time of unnecessary wars. Buy it... Laugh... you can do it over and over."
4,THE BEST FILM OF THE MARX BROTHERS.,"What do Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton and the Marx Brothers have in common? They never said a vulgar joke, and, oh yeah, all of them are legends and created some of the funniest movies of all time.Well, ""Duck Soup"" is the funniest movie that the Marx brothers ever did. The movie is packed with hilarious dialogue, wacky scenes, unforgettable comedic sequences, and smart satire.What comedic styles appear in ""Duck Soup""? You name it: it has slapstick, satire, physical gags, smart one-liners, smart elaborated jokes, musical humor, etc, etc, etc. If you haven't seen a Marx Brothers film, please, do yourself a favor and go watch ""Duck Soup"". By the time the final credits appear on screen, you will get rid of your ""American Pie"" DVD's (if you have one), you will trash your Adam Sandler collection (if you have it). Well, I'm only joking, bottom line: the Marx Bros. are the real deal."
2,Hit and miss,"Duck Soup is one of the classic rammed-to-the-gunnells gag movies. Its influence throughout so much later cinema, such as Woody Allen, Airplane perhaps is paramount, and there are certainly classic episodes such as the mirror scene. But I found that many of the gags fell flat, wordplay that was neither very clever or very funny, and some of the parody aspect such as the music hall comedy pastiche looks rather dated and not in a immortal, timepiece type of way. For me, I prefer the slapstick of Woody Allen's earlier films, but the Marx brothers are well up there as classic comic producers of all time, so who am I to say. I just found lines such as: 'Keep it under your hat, no, tell you what, I'll keep it under my hat' didn't ring many comedic cherries."
2,Classic humour but perhaps limited in appeal,"Much has already been said about this movie already - suffice to say that this is a classic comedy that will suit a limited audience.What interests me is Groucho's acting. Look carefully at his manner, especially during the early stages of the film. To me he looks uneasy, almost embarassed in front of the camera. This spoils the effect. I've never heard this mentioned before but as a first-time Marx viewer it is the thing that surprised me most of all."
5,Wonderful flick,"I have always been and will continue to be a BIG fan of anything Groucho!! Duck Soup is not exception!! If you are into the Marx Brothers at all, you'll love this!!!"
4,One of the best Marx films,"This is such a great movie to watch, it's a shame it's not longer. Groucho is superb as Rufus T. Firefly, I think this role probably suited him the best of all his films. His sharp wit is most evident in this film. If the war scene was longer, then I would have given it 5 stars, because the ending seemed somewhat anticlimactic, but still an excellent picture."
5,Classic comedy,"The small state of Freedonia needs help to get itself out of bankruptcy. The wealthy Mrs. Teasdale agrees to donate $20 million dollars only if Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho Marx) is appointed its new president. Firefly is a cynical, sarcastic dictator who refuses to play politics by the book. Firefly attempts to win the hand of Mrs. Teasdale but so does the Ambassador of the neighboring country, Sylvania. When the two leaders cannot resolve their dispute over the wealthy dowager, war between the countries is declared and Mrs. Teasdale's house comes under attack.This is the Marx brothers at their best. ""Remember, we're fighting for this lady's honour. Which is more than she ever did"""
5,"Regardless of your age, you will like this movie!","This wonderfully hilarious Marx Brothers movie is considered a classic of the genre, and is sometime held up as the best movie that the Marx Brothers ever made. As is often the case with movies that later went on to become cult classics, this one was not a success at the time of its release, and was considered by many to have been a failure. But, the truth will out, and if you watch this movie, you will fall in love with the Marx Brothers' off-beat humor.If you like a funny movie, then regardless of your age, you will like this movie! Even though it was made in 1933, the humor holds up excellently, making the movie a riot to watch even now in the twenty-first century! Watch a classic, watch Duck Soup!(Review of Duck Soup starring the Marx Brothers)"
5,Great for kids!!,"I ended up purchasing this vacuum when I was looking for a toy vacuum for my 3 year-old. He LOVES to sweep, so I was planning on getting him a toy sweeper when I came across this model in the vacuum aisle at Wal-Mart. It was the same price as the toys, and it actually worked! With the telescoping handle, we could size it just for him. Once we got it home, he spent the next 2 hours vacuuming my house. It's not too heavy or too loud for him (not sure what the other reviewer was talking about). He calls it 'My red sweeper.' So, if you're looking for a working vacuum for your child, try it out!"
5,An awesome product,"My wife and I needed a new vacuum but hadn't yet researched the models available. We saw this one and it was $39 so we thought we'd try it.Wow. When I first turned it on, cat hair swirled in the dust container. I couldn't believe it. Our existing vac cost about $300 and seemingly wouldn't touch the dirt. This this found and collected dirt where we thought there was little.Yes, you have to empty the dust container often, maybe once per room in our case, but it is really easy to do and since you can SEE it get full, not a problem. I'd much rather see the dirt getting collected and know that the vacuum is working than guess and check a bag.How long the HEPA filter lasts is a question yet unanswered, but it is easy to remove and clean over a trash can.Don't let the low price fool you. This vacuum does a great job, is lightweight, and easy to care for!"
4,not like US pops,"Not like US pops, the minor code is many and it would guide you to the French feeling! He's as grat as Serge I think... try his, I mean Julien's, ""Cherchell"" either."
2,Bureaucratic performance.,"This recording is no match for , e.g., the Pierre Boulez's Water Music, with th NY Simphony Orchestra. Don't recomend it."
4,Australian SF Reader,"Dr Nikola is an enigmatic supervillain type, with his own strange code of honor. Unfortunately for him, he crosses paths with a bored adventurer on holiday, and life becomes more difficult for him. A fun, straightforward, clear adventure on one hand, with the enigmatic Nikola in the background."
4,Adult Swim is back in session.,"I remember staying up late at night watching this on Adult Swim with my sister, it's one of those animes for people who don't usually like animes. It has a more Film Noir art style as opposed to conventional big eyes,crazy hair anime style. Oh and theres robots..lots and lots of robots."
3,Cheaper at the store,When I purchased this iteam I thought it was a larger box. When I recived the product I noticed it was less expensive at my local Walmart. Make sure you check prices.
1,not happy,"I ordered this product on June 7th 2006, today is July 11th 2006, and I still have not received it. I have cancelled my order because it is a lot faster to drive to the story to purchase it, than to wait over a month for it to show up. I'm really not happy with the turn around time for the Tide HE Detergent."
4,"great product, but badly calibrated scoop for my washer","Just ordered, so I can't comment on Amazon's shipping of it, but I have used it with my Miele front loading washer very successfully.One major caveat, though: I use *WAY* less detergent than the scoop suggests - half of the lowest mark on the scoop is plenty. More than that and suds remain. Perhaps if you have pets or kids who play in the mud a lot you need the higher amounts, but my ""normal"" wash sure doesn't warrant it and in fact seems to work better with the lower amounts. (This also means you get a lot of loads out of a single box.) Again, this is for a Miele undercounter frontloader - YMMV on other brands."
1,Very Heavily Scented,"If you are at all sensitive to fragrances, this product is not for you.I washed only one load of laundry in my brand new HE washer using Tide ""Original Scent"". Even though I used half of the recommended quantity of powder, the fragrance was so strong when I took the clothes out of the washer that I ended up washing the entire load two more times, without detergent, to reduce the smell. After the third washing, there was still enough scent left on the laundry that I could tell which towels had been in HE washer, and which ones were done in my old washer the day before using unscented liquid detergent.After doing some research on-line, I found Sear's fragrance-free HE powder. I have done several loads of laundry using it, and am happy with the results. It does a decent job cleaning the clothes, and they don't come out of the washer smelling like perfume."
5,Great value!,"These shoes have withheld strenuous tap routines from my son and are still going strong. The taps are still in perfect condition, and the tops are still holding with minor scuffs."
5,Great seller!!! Flawless transaction!!!!,This book was just as described in the listing. The seller was very prompt in mailing the item upon payment. I would recommend this seller to other buyers.
4,User friendly - not research friendly,"This book contains a great deal of information about conducting focus groups and is very easy to use; however, the format is far too simplistic. Focus groups are a research technique; this book takes the approach of ""so easy even a child could do it."" Although it is filled with information and guidelines about appropriate techniques and uses for data, the lighthearted format undermines the serious nature of data collection and analysis. The second edition was much better as a comprehensive guide to focus groups that maintained some research integrity.Incidentally, I suspect that Paladin Red actually reviewed the second edition. The third edition does not contain appendices after each chapter - another unfortunate loss from the earlier edition."
4,Focus Group,This book is an excellent guide to those who have interest in conducting qualitative research. It guides the reader to a step by step to conducting a grounded research as well as how and why to ask questions. I recommend this book where it is an excellent source for beginners and complicated qualitative researchers.
2,Not that impressed,I guess I had hoped for something a little different. It still sits on the shelf without having been used.
3,Not his best,"While certainly not his best, this one contains a few nice songs. As usual the lyrics are great but the music has suffered somewhat."
4,Good Rush Hour Music!,A friend from France gave me the CD and I am hooked! Actually I am on line with Amazon right now ordering a copy for my mom! I particularly love his Elvis/Dylan style with a great fast beat!
3,Saxon's Sanctum Rocks!,"Saxon's new disc is brilliant. Saxon is one of theoriginal 80's metal bands like Priest, Maiden etc.that ruled until MTV killed metal! They have changedwith different sounds but this time they have combinedall the past and present into one classic metal album.While I loved Dogs of War from 95 it was hit and missbut still has some classic Saxon moments. The ChroniclesDVD is also brilliant. Biff and the boys will satisfy anyfan past present and hopefully more in the future! Also ifyou can find the 2 disc set with DVD it's awesome!"
2,Nowhere else to go..,"To my utter disappointment, Saxon worked again with producer Charlie Bauerfeind, a producer specialized in European power metal bands, the ones that use double-kick drums all the time, sing only about the Templars, dragons, magicians, whatever. The result was tragic in LIONHEART, the previous Saxon album, because basically there was no Saxon in it anymore: just pedestrian and generic European power metal.The formula repeated itself in this album. There is no spark, nothiong brilliant, not one song even close to become a classic.Anyway, any band that lasts for so long in the very difficult music business has incredible merit and should be praised, not criticized.Buy this album if you're a Saxon completist or if you're into generic European metal."
3,Does not allow use of the larger battery.,"This is a good case if you use the slim battery, but it does not fit with the extended use battery."
4,Stainless steel exhaust tips,The exhaust tips look and sound great. The mounting system is not the greatest set-up though. I just used stainless steel U-bolt exhaust clamps to clamp the tips on and that worked great. For the price I thought they were good compared to Magnaflow or Gibson.
5,Wonderful,"If you love beautiful homes and other commercial structures and appreciate architecture, then you will love this book as I do. Paul Williams was truly a very gifted architect and did his job well. He designed gorgeous homes that I still think are attractive today. I even like the interior furnishings and decorations of years past. I pull this book out every so often and always find something to give me a treat and occupy several minutes of my time. If it only had an alphabetical index and exact addresses of the places he designed and assisted with, that is the only criticism I have. Just a beautiful, beautiful book."
3,Did I Get The Wrong Color?,"I ordered this because I wanted a canary yellow cable with clear hook-in tabs. Instead, I got something that looks beige with grayish hook-in tabs.Whatever... It seems to work just fine.Three stars because the pictured color schematic looks nothing like what I received."
1,It is made of plastic!!!,"This item is made of plastic and will not hold up in a commercial application. In a number of applications I have learned that you must have a metal flush valve for the product to have any longevity at all. I returned the items to ""Closeouts for less"" (the people selling them when I bought). Do not purchase unless you want to replace in less than a year."
4,Another good single from the 7th deadly sin,I have listened to Valuable game over and over and have come to the conclusion that Ice T can take any song sample it and make it sound hard core. The sample is from En Vogue And Ice can make even there music have an edge. I can't wait till the Evidence comes out
2,"Plastic sheet is removable, sticky residue is left behind",3M needs to work more on this tape. The concept is good but the adhesive seems to adhere more strongly to the pasted surface than to its own plastic sheet. Perhaps the adhesive to the plastic sheet side should be made stronger.I just spent the last half hour slowly lifting off the sticky residues left behind with a piece of tape.
1,"Very, very light tape","I was trying to find a tape that would hold temporarily and remove easily and cleanly. This tape removes cleanly because it hardly holds at all. It has very, very light tack to it. Its even lighter than a post-it-note and won't even stick to the razor edge on the tape dispenser. I have a 3-inch core roll of it so will try to use it somehow but I wouldn't reorder it. I still need a tape that sticks and this was the same as not using any tape at all."
4,Smokin' Blues!,Great stuff here. If you like your Blues on the rock side (without actually becoming rock) than you'll love this. A shame this guy is not huge.
2,Too Simplistic,"I am a Christian myself, but this book didn't offer me much in the way of logical arguments. Serious topics are skimmed over simplistically and unconvincingly, and it is occasionally embarrassing, with them insisting that evolution must be wrong because it violates the second law of thermodynamics! <Sigh>! I also disagree with many of their views, and found that the answers they gave would hardly convince many skeptics. It would be quite useful as a first apologetics book for people who aren't well-versed in philosophy or deeper dealings with subjects, though I don't recommend it."
4,Real questions you've always wondered about.,"Brief (a few pages) responses to all your questions about the Christian faith. Don't be a skeptic, get the facts!"
3,Handy but not perfect,"The concept is a great idea and does make gift wrapping a bit easier. That said, it isn't perfect. You must be very careful not to let the tape stick to the sides of the dispenser. the fit into the dispenser also isn't perfect and I had to open it up and re-start it many times when wrapping my holiday gifts. again, it is a handy concept if you do alot of gift wrapping, but for everyday taping, it is cheaper and easier to just stick with the traditional dispenser for now."
2,Sticky Mess,"While this product is great in theory, in practice it just doesn't work. The tape sticks together and you can't get just one piece - you get a clump of tape strips stuck together that you get to try to peel apart. Love the idea, it just doesn't work the way it is supposed to."
3,Love/Hate (because of Amazon),"While I absolutely love 3M Magic Pop UP tape strips and make them essential to my business, this is the second time I've purchased from an Amazon vendor where the quality was at issue. The tape normally pops out as fast as you can pull them, but the Amazon vendors must buy from old stock. The tape gums up, clogs the dispenser and becomes unusable.I will continue my use of the product but seek alternative vendors away from Amazon to make my large purchases."
2,nowhere going....,i always hate doing this but this guide's not very good. it only took an hour deciding not to read any further.
4,Opps.,"I too messed up because I thought I was buying a dispenser that would acommodate 2 inch wide tape. So the description isn't very good for the novice. It should state it is only for 1"" wide tape. However, it is nicely made, a good weight. Too much expense and hassle to send it back so I'll keep it for other uses."
2,Would Not Recommend,"I regularly use this measuring set and would not recommend anyone get them if there is another option available. They do perform the tasks they are designed to ie they measure liquid and solids. I hate that the measuring set, specifically the cups are not weighted properly. By this I mean that when they are empty or filled the cup bottoms do not remain even on the flat surface. They tend to tip or tilt toward the handle. If there is a liquid or solid in the cup, it causes it to fall out. Therefore, a carefully measured amount of food can become not so carefully measured when it falls out on the counter or floor."
2,Never buy plastic measuring tools!,"Well, shame on me. I lost everything in a fire last year and needed all new kitchen gadgets and appliances. I liked the fact that this set had so many pieces, but within six months, the plastic lining began to peel on the interior of the cups. I have thrown them out. I am still using the measuring spoons, but will toss them too when I find a decent replacement set. I am moving on to stainless steel, as I should have in the first place. I had too many items to replace to spend a lot of time reviewing items and think clearly. Fortunately, these have been my only disappointment from my Amazon purchases. I would suggest skipping this lot!"
4,This set has it all,"I do a lot of baking and needed an extra measuring set. I found this one here on Amazon and it looked to be just what I needed. Because it is included in the 4-for-3 promotion I made sure to find a couple more items to order with it and make it even more of a deal price wise.Overall it's a good starter set containing one each of the following cup sizes 1/4, 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, 1; teaspoon sizes 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, 1 and tablespoon sizes 1/2, 1. They stack compactly and also have a ring to keep them together. Clean up is easy with just a little soap and warm water."
3,Works well!,They work great! Just depending on what you measure out it might stain! i only had that happen with one of them. Other than that I am satisfied with the product.
3,Good and bad,"I used reviews in choosing these measuring cups. I love the long handles and large print sizing, but the long handles make the cups tip over when stacked for storage."
5,Strong Armed,"The arm is made very well. It is manufactured in Italy, likely by Manfrotto. It has the same sturdy double ball joint mechanism that is used in many Manfrotto items. The difference between this arm and the one Manfrotto sells is in the way the reflector is held. The ""jaws"" on the Westcott open easier and grip better on the reflector. As noted in prior reviews, it is best mounted on a light stand with a sand bag. You could mount to your tripod head if you purchase a female threaded stud. Or you could mount it to the leg of tripod or sign/pipe with clamp/stud combo. It is must have for shooting outside and helps control shadows in studio."
3,"If you're a female, just starting out, it's great.","This video is perfect for a female who is just starting out. Think hip-hop in the late 90's. It's not some ""new moves"" video, but it's got the basics (which is exactly the target audience). Unfortunatly, I'm a male, and doing 80% of these dance moves would look, well...a little feminine.I will give this video to my wife and hope she enjoys it.The female who describes all the moves has something a a Russian or Cezh accent, but it's easy enough to understand.The video layout, and step-by-step instruction is some of the most simple to follow, and she does the moves from multiple angles."
3,good for someone who has no hiphop dance experience,"Personally I found this dvd to be a waste of money. I was buying it to tune up on some of my hiphop moves since I havent been out dancing in a while. This dvd is VERY basic. If you do not know anything about hiphop dancing this would be a great dvd for you to learn off of. She goes through the movements fairly slow and with a couple of different angles, but she tends to move around her dance floor a lot which can make the angles a little odd and hard to follow if you are doing it as she is doing it. If you are trying to learn new moves, this is not the dvd for you. These are older basic hiphop moves she shows you. Also, I would use your own music to go along with this dvd, the music is pretty cheesy and is not the hiphop most people are accustomed to."
5,"Fun, easy",I think this is a great dance DVD for beginners. She breaks things down and the moves are pretty easy once you get used to them. I have seen some of these moves in movies and clubs so you know you can use them in public without looking strange (assuming you practiced them anyways) I like this DVD better than most dance DVDs I tried. There are a lot of routines too.
1,BORING,"this was so boring i laughed at it rather than trying to do the moves. The routine was way outdated, the chick was a little too much. I would never recommend buying this, because it is a BIG waste of money. Im reselling it thats how bad it is."
2,Ummmm..,I could barely understand what she is saying... She's either hispanic or of arabic decent. Didn't like her dance style
1,Funny smell - didn't want it around my daughter,"I got this for inside the house so my daughter wouldn't get bitten at night, but the smell was so funky I didn't want her breathing it in. Plus, the little bit I did use it... it really didn't seem to help. I got a big zapper for the entire property and it did the trick. Should have just spent the money and done it right from the start."
1,Junk,Black & Decker MR200 Mosquito Halo Inhibitor SystemI purchased on 06/12/2008. Did not work. Not worth the postage to send back.
1,Flimsy product - don't buy it,"I recently bought a couple of Halo MR 200 mosquito inhibitor devices. I found that they were of very poor quality and flimsy construction. I could see some LED leads/wires as soon as I received the devices but I packed them for my trip to India without further examination. In India, I found that the white top of the first unit had come lose. It continued to operate but the door hinge broke after opening a couple of times. After replacing the battery a few times on the first unit, the main brown unit itself began separating into two, resulting in poor battery contact. Though the second unit exhibited no visible damage, the unit's fan and lights would not work at all but the speaker emitted clicks (ultrasound I assume).This is not the quality and construction I have come to expect from a Black and Decker product. Apparently, it is manufactured by Applica but uses the Black and Decker brand name..."
1,"Works, but.............","This really works, but with a very small variaty of species of mosquitos, may be very small"
5,Works perfect for my BMW with Spacers,Bought these longer lug bolts to be used on my BMW with 12mm and 15mm wheel spacers. Works perfect on my E90 BMW 335i.
3,you get what you pay for,"I bought this strap for a guitar I bought in a large order. It looked pretty cool in the picture. I have to say it feels like the pressed leather belts you can buy from hot topic or spencers with the metal studs in it, the ones that fall apart after a month and a half. I'm posting a picture also so you can see how this this strap is. I cant be upset with the product too much since it is relatively cheap. In short, if you want an amazing strap, go ahead and pay a little extra somewhere else."
4,Easy to Use,"This product is easy to use, but some of your business cards will fall out if not properly inserted into slots. But all in all its very good to clean up messy business cards laying around. Teresa,KY."
3,Adequate,"This product is adequate for home use but, I wouldn't recommend it for heavy use. The cards come off too easily and the wheel doesn't stay in place very well as one tries to view the address. Good for the price."
5,Just as it says!,I was happy with it. Did just what it says. Can't understand why others might be disappointed. Go for it!
3,Good but really small!,"Make sure you notice the product dimensions - this book literally is about 5"" square - I was expecting a larger book. But the content is fantastic - who doesn't love a bananamobile?"
2,OK,This book is good because it is a good size for little hands and strong...however I do not like this book because some of the words for the letters are very strange and I think they don't make a lot of sense....we just look at the pictures and say the letters and I make up new words when we read it. Not one of my favorite books at all.
5,Cute board book!,"I loved Richard Scarry books as a child and I was so excited to get this board book for my nine-month-old son. The illustrations are so cute of the various cars, trucks, and vehicles, and of the Richard Scarry animals driving them. The book is a nice short length so it maintains my son's interest when I read it to him. This is a great board book for babies and I highly recommend it!"
5,short and sweet,"What a cute little book! I first read it to kids when I was working in a church nursery, and I found it so effective at entertaining small children that I bought a copy for myself for when I babysit. Small children seem fascinated by all the different types of cars, and the small sturdy pages make it perfect for them to look through themselves if they want to. a good investment for a childrens' book collection."
3,"Cute book, but oh so tiny!","If I remember correctly, there were no product dimensions specified on this book, just PACKAGE dimensions and weight. This book is about 3"" by 3"" and 1/2"" thick. Cute, but I thought I was getting a book a bit bigger for $3.99. On the bright side, it's travel size and fits nicely in the diaper bag!"
4,Love this little book,What a great book for your little one. A heavy board book that little hands can hold and enjoy without ruining the book.
5,My 18 month old loves it,"Of all the countless books my son now owns, this is the one he repeatedly returns to, picks up and pages slowly through.He loves pointing out certain cars (the one that's Upside Down is a real hit) and I love that I finally bought him a book he enjoys so much."
4,Richard Scarry's Cars and Trucks from A to Z (A Chunky Book(R)),"My son loves the cars and trucks, the illustrations are cute and imaginative. We have fun pointing out the letters and talking about sounds. I didn't realize the book would be so small, but it's nice for travel.Thanks,Lyndsey Jones"
3,For the very young only.,"My older son loved it from 10-14 months. Then he stopped taking it out. We found out why when he was 18 months, he said, ""no 'moncar"" (i.e. no such thing as lemon car"", and ""no like"". And now he won't let us read it to his younger brother. He prefers the ""better silly books"" that actually uses imagination than slapping words together to make a book."
3,Small but Cute,"This book is very small. That makes it nice to carry around, but hard to see the little drawings on the pages. Our 15 month old daughter doesn't understand all the crazy cars (pickle car, toothpaste car, etc.), we have a good time reading it occasionally. If you're interested in a Richard Scary book, I would recommend a larger book with more going on on each page. My nephew has a huge one that he loves to stare at."
3,Poor Quality,"This book basically started to come apart at the seams and peeling apart after the first time I opened it.Otherwise, everything that Richard Scarry created is fantastic, even the stuff that has been modified to fit today's politically correct leanings."
5,Best.Book.EVER!,"This teeny tiny book is perfect for teeny tiny baby hands. My 18 month old flips the pages of this book in his carseat, studying each and every truck. He actually loves it so much that he often whines for us to let him take it to bed with him and we see him in the video monitor flipping the pages and giggling to himself. At $3.99 a piece, it's a book you should have 3 of so you can never be without."
3,NOT AS BIG AS PICTURE MAKES IT LOOK,"The book itself is very cute but I was expecting a much bigger book it is only 4""x4"" for the price I was expecting a book at least 7"". haven't decieded if i am keeping it yet or not... would probably be a good one for my daughter to put in the bag to take along to church for grandsons."
4,"cute book, but very small",This book is a board book and is really cute! I did not know how small in size it is....no bigger than a child's hand!
5,My 15 month-old loves this book!,"It is the perfect size for her small hands and she loves the colorful pictures. Granted, some of the cars are a little strange in order to get through all of the letters in the alphabet (how about a corn car or a zippermobile?). The best things about this book are the size and the fact that it is a relatively indestructable board book. It also brings back my own childhood memories of Richard Scary books."
2,VERY Tiny,"Dimensions of this book are provided, however, I guess the actual size from the dimensions did not register with me. This book is VERY tiny!"
3,Some letters clumped on same page,This is a cute small boardbook that you can carry around in your purse and review the ABC's with your child. About the size of a real apple. My only complaint is that it is a little confusing to have different letters and pictures clumped on the same page.
4,A unique view of what a pitching coach does,"Mel Stottlemeyre gives us a unique insight into what a pitching coach does at the major league level. We lean over his shoulder as he coaches such talents as Doc Gooden, David Cone, Andy Pettite and Roger Clemens. We also learn some about the funnier side of the Yankee dynasty. Players taking out their frustrations with bats on the toilets of the clubhouse, pitchers punching and braking their hands on walls; and pitchers making off the record derogatory comments about their opponents to the press which are later published. All in all this is a book all Yankee fans should own."
3,Be careful when ordering...,"I ordered 3"" core 1/2"" scotch tape in mid December, after my local stores dropped it without explanation. It's now March, and I need more, but when I try to re-order I get shunted to this page. It still SAYS 3"" core, but it's obviously showing the smaller rolls. I'm not sure if 3M is discontinuing this standard office supply, but be careful when you order, you might not get what you're supposed to get."
5,Every classical musician should have this recording!,"I originally purchased this recording to hear the brass sections of three power-house orchestras playing together. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but this recording has become one of my top ten favorites! The playing is wonderfully musical, well executed, and inspirational. Abe Torchinsky, a former Principal Tuba player from the Philadelphia Orchestra who is featured on this recording, writes in the liner notes, ""We went in, sat down, and had fun"" -- this is what music should be!Every classical musician should own this recording. I am a singer, conductor and organist -- have never played a brass instrument in my life -- and I love it!"
1,"How not to play the expressive, elegant and sober music of Gabrieli","This recording has one use - to entertain modern brass players.The music on this disc has nothing to do with Giovanni Gabrieli - the music is just exploited by a bunch of BOBs (Boys On Brass).The subtle and elegant music of Giovanni Gabrieli deserves better than this! Gabrieli's music was written for violins, cornetti, sackbuts, organs, violones and theorbos - not instruments designed to play Shostakovich, Richard Strauss and Glen Miller!If in doubt try any Gabrieli recording by Concerto Palatino, Musica Fiata, the Gabrieli Consort & Players or the Taverner Consort & Players."
2,Slm02005-60/6 my light,I liked the product and the concept but the light was not as bright as I thought it should have been.It did not shine enough light for a book light. I was dissappointed. The mobility was very good.I did return it and received a prompt credit.
4,"Dr. Reenault's Secret DVD (1942) J. Carrol Naish, Shepperd Strudwick","FOR A B MOVIE MADE DURING WWII THIS IS AN INTERESTING LITTLE FLICK. THE ENDING WILL NOT SURPRISE YOU AS IT MAY HAVE AUDIENCES DECADES AGO, BUT ANY FAN OF CLASSIC HORROR FILMS WILL FIND THE SOMEWHAT MOREAU-LIKE PLOT INTERESTING. WHEN PUT INTO PERSPECTIVE WITH THE UNIVERSAL RELEASE OF THE CLASSIC ""THE WOLF MAN"" JUST A YEAR EARLIER AND THE LATER 'PLANET OF THE APES' FILMS THIS LITTLE GEM SHOULD NOT BE MISSED."
5,...but I didn't realize it was teacher's edition.,"I thought I was purchasing the workbook, but got the teacher's edition instead. I don't know if that was my omission or theirs. Otherwise, it is a good copy which arrived punctually."
1,OUTDATED!!,"This book is absolutely useless. I didn't realize that this book was printed 13 years ago when I bought it. The PLACE test doesn't even follow this format anymore, there's is not even a written portion on the test, but the book mentions it again and again. The scoring has also changed.I just took my PLACE test and passed with flying colors. After looking at this book I figured I didn't give myself enough time to study and decided not to study at all. I assumed I'd just have to bite the bullet and take it again, but the test was a breeze. If you've taken the ACT/SAT or any classes recently, you have nothing to worry about. You have 4 hours to complete 100 multiple choice questions. That's the whole test. I finished in about 90 mins and checked all my answers three times. I think most people finished in about 2 hours.Bottom line:DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!"
1,Very Uncomfortable,"I wore these shoes for almost two weeks. My heels were in so much pain I had to finally give up and put on my old pair of reeboks, just so I could walk. I do not recommend these shoes for people who want arch support or heel cushioning."
5,Barrel organ and organ solo pieces,"Don't listen to the reviewers who look down on Ligeti's work for barrel organ or for organ. The organ was an essential element of Ligeti's music, and Ligeti has done much to modernize the organ in the 20th century. I would say his pieces rank among the most important pieces for organ in the last century.The barrel organ pieces are finely crafted, and the exploit the barrel organ's possibilities. They are fun to listen to, and this is something people tend to forget when writing about Ligeti's music: Ligeti was not simply a tedious musician, but he was always are that music should foremost be fun, bring pleasure to an audience."
1,More interesting in concept than execution,The interest here lies more in the ideas behind these pieces than their actual execution. Take the symphony for 100 metronomes. One hundred metronomes are wound up and then allowed to wind down until they all are silent. The 19 minutes here of that are unlistenable-it is nothing more than maddening tick-tocking with no interesting occurences either by chance or design. The pieces for barrel organ and player piano are played at incredible speeds-but to no purpose whatsoever. This sort of playfulness may have been amusing to Ligeti at the time but to the listener it is not at all entertaining. This is one of those experimental music albums that you listen to once and then put away forever.
3,You must like the Thompson system,"I have had a KJV Thompson and an NIV Thompson. The Thompson reference system lists a chain of six verses for each chain. If more are needed, a link to a new chain of six verses is given. The big problem I have with the Thompson chain system is the passages in the chain are often rather arbitrary. They are not linked by usage of the same Greek or Hebrew root word. Often they do not even treat the same biblical concept. Much more useful to me is the cross reference system in either the NASB or in the Nestle Greek New Testament. The archeological supplement at the back is good and helpful. The concordance is too short to be of much use, just like similar concordances in other Bibles. Some of the charts in the back of the Bible are helpful for a quick overview of themes or characters."
1,Bor-ing Whiny Book,"Maybe I shouldn't have bought the book in the first place. I have always liked Betty Comden on a professional basis. But after reading this boring and terribly self-indulgent book, my opinion of her has lowered drastically.Quite frankly, her life growing up and all of her wonderful friends and aches and pains are not worth reading about. Now if this was more of a balanced autobiography that combined her professional and personal lives, the book would be much better. She grew up rich (she admits the Great Depression did not affect her much) and became quite successful. She admits to guilt about being a part-time mother and talks at embarrassing length about her son who died of HIV due to his years as a drug addict...."
2,Disappointed,"While it does cover finger spelling and it does introduce new signs, the black background, strange songs and skits, abrupt way it shows children making a sign, and some dark scenes such as a witch making a brew makes this video convey a negative feeling about sign language, in my opinion. My son seemed scared by some parts, and my husband walked in the room and said, ""this one is really weird"" since the first song only adults could figure out. I prefer the more upbeat, positive and easier sign langauge videos that make my child smile throughout such as the Say, Sing and Sign series and Sign Me a Story."
1,Sign and ABC nowhere near as good as Sign Songs,"After buying Sign Songs, I was eager to buy more videos produced by the same company. So eager, as a matter of fact, that when Amazon informed me they were unable to get Sign and ABC, I logged onto the company's website and ordered it directly from them (ten dollars more expensive than with Amazon).I can definately see where someone would think this video is creepy or strange. The main song was meant to sound like a folk song, but didn't quite come off right, and the sound quality is poor.A few of the children signing don't smile at all, either glaring at the camera or looking very apathetic. It's not fun to watch at all."
2,good idea.... but,"got this to transition from tub/shower baths for mom to an aide coming for personal hygiene-- she HATED it and didn't feel clean, so it wouldn't have been for her if it were free!! now we have an aide & use tubs with 'real water & soap'... guess who is happy once she go used to another person bathing her (which took awhile, i might add!)!!"
5,no rinse,"We have used the product for several years, and love it. Just about out of it and checked Amazon for it. It was available, and at a much better price than our previous source. It arrived when they said it would, and we are totally satisfied with this transaction."
2,Too thin / liquidy,"Hard to apply and use because it runs everywhere. I was hoping for a consistency a little closer to a regular body was -- maybe not quite so thick, but thicker than this."
5,Well written and organized,"I used this book to teach a junior level intro course on probability and statistics, and overall I am very satisfied with it. The book strikes a nice balance between mathematical rigor on the one hand and a wide range of concrete examples on the other. I found the presentation and arrangement of material to be much more natural than the other text I've used (Hogg and Tanis)."
3,I agree with the Rice student,"I had Olofsson for Prob/Stat at Tulane. Having no background on this subject matter, I was utterly confused throughout most of the semester, along with my classmates. This would make for a good upper level class, but definitely not intro. The sample problems are totally different from the examples in the text and there are a few errors in the answers."
1,Poorly written textbook,"This textbook lacks direction. The chapters are very poorly organized (chapter three lasts for 118 pages, and covers material that could easily be divided into several, while chapter four lasts for only 17), and the material is haphazardly presented to the reader. Too often is the ""proof left to the reader."" And rarely is anything ""intuitively obvious"" in an introductory statistics course.It may be an excellent book for those who already know statistics. But this is not a textbook that should be used at the introductcory level for an intro statistics class."
3,"Holds the light, doesn't fit the car.","I purchased this item because the car matching program told me it would fit my 2002 Ford Explorer. It fit the connection, but wouldn't fit into my blinker housing. It has the right screw in attachment, but instead of being straight out the back, this piece is bent. Right now it's just dangling inside the light housing and dimmer than it should be. I have to buy a whole new one. Not cool."
2,Mot much bang for your buck,"If you're a musical omnivore, with a broad conception of the term ""progressive"", you can probably find something to like here. Or if you're a wealthy collector, you could always buy it for the sake of having it.But this release did nothing for me. The music lacks direction, energy, and above all else: complexity. It pales to insignificance compared to what contemporary Yes and Genesis were producing at the time. Ange is bare bones, unambitious - simple to the point of simplicity.And if they music had been more interesting? Then I'd be disappointed that it clocks in under 36 minutes."
2,Poor picture,"I researched digital photo frames until my eyes bled and I was sure that I was choosing a winner. How wrong I was. Some of my criteria were a great picture and a classy, attractive frame. I thought the TAO would have a good picture based on its 800x600 pixel display. Well, maybe the number of pixels were there, but the color saturation was not! The picture was muddy and washed out. There were no adjustments on the display whatsoever. Brightness adjustment was mentioned in the manual, but did not exist. I am now going to order a Philips frame. It does not have all the bells and whistles and the frame is a little too modern for me, but all the reviews mention a truly outstanding picture quality. Isn't that what we really want from a digital photo frame?Pros: great frame and many frame choices. Can't really think of any others.Cons: very poor picture quality and no adjustments."
5,Excellent! Must have,Unfortunately I don't have too much time to write reviews but I like this one so much that I had to write a few lines.This is an excellent DVD. The image quality is superband so is the sound. This is a very intimist acoustic concertwhich should please any listener. I highly recommend
1,Glad I didn't buy it!,"Having a reasonable background in Access, I thought this would be a good book to learn SQL Server. WRONG! About the only things she explains are the wizards - which I thought were supposed to be self-explanatory. I was about 200 pages into the book before I found something even remotely useful, and by then I had no patience left to finish the book. If you're really thinking about buying this book, save yourself some money... at least go to the book with a list of questions and try to answer them using just the book... I guess I should check out Andy Baron/Mary Chipman's book on Access/SQL Server/ADPs... This book would only be good for starting up the BBQ..."
2,Not really a programming book - For beginners only,"This book has the wrong title, it should be called ""SQL Server 2000 Basics"". The word 'programming' should definitely be taken away from the title as only about 1/3 of the book deals with programming, in just the most basic way. This book is just an intro to SQL Server, nothing too detailed. For someone that knows nothing about SQL Server, you will learn the basics here, but you will need to buy other books to get the details."
1,Don't waste your money,"When I first started to read this book, I wanted to learn more about SQL, but this book failed. As the title says, it's pretty much just a bunch of step-by-step exercises and screen shots, but doesn't really get into too much detail, or give any reasons or explanation.The only reason why I am writing a review now is that I now have something to compare this book against.If you want a great book on SQL programming, I suggest you pick up ""Profession SQL Server 2000 Programming"" by Robert Vieira (Wrox Press), which is a great book even for novices.IF you really want to buy this book, I have a copy that I'd be willing to let go for dirt cheap."
3,"Many Subjects, but Shallow Coverage","This book is good for a complete beginner to SQL Server, but if you're familiar with SQL generally, or if you've used SQL Server 6.5 or 7.0, you'd do well to purchase a different book (I recommend Professional SQL 2000 by Wrox Press).This book *is* very clear, and it presents a great deal of screen shots. For some people that will be great. However, the step-by-step screen shots might be a bit too much for some folks (it steps through each dialog box for most tasks).While this book is extremely clear, it doesn't offer real world advice.For beginners -- four stars. For pros -- two stars."
1,Very Little Substance,"It seems that the author was more interested in page count than substance. This book is filled with screenshots on how to navigate through SQL Server without the slightest explanation of why. Its a ""how to"" book with out the ""why to"". The back cover of this book states that this is a ""must have resource"". For who? Wrox owes it's readers an apology."
1,Too little content,"Unfortunately this book does a very poor job of explaining the necessary concepts of SQL Server. It does an o-kay job of showing you how to find a wizard to complete some basic tasks, but is seriously lacking in offering the necessary theoretical foundation to becoming a proficient SQL Server developer. I'm surprised this is the best Microsft could do for an entry level book."
5,Moves a Ton of Air,"This fan is great for cooling you down quickly. It could almost benefit from an even slower minimum setting, as this thing really pushes a lot of air."
4,Not deterred,"Although I am well aware of the leg design issue, I have found that this unit really creates a very high air flow at a reasonable price. I had one that actually fell victim to the leg issue and I was not able to find a replacement blade assembly so I needed a new one...and I decided taht I still like the blow you get for your $$! Lesson learned - I will be more cautious with how this oen is positioned and I kept the legs from the old one as replacements."
3,Barely supported by cheap plastic legs,"It was a nice fan while it lasted. But then it got bumped and two of the plastic legs slightly cracked where they attach to the middle. It doesn't look broken, but will no longer stand up straight. I don't think they should support such a heavy fan with such flimsy plastic legs that get brittle and break after you've had it a while.I've contacted the company. If they reply and offer to replace the legs, I will update this review."
3,Noisy and flimsy,"I purchased this fan because of its blade size and footstand being an X as oppossed to a round platform. After assembly I observe that the fan is quite noisy in LO, in HI it sounds like you are at the airport standing next to a Cessna 150. Plastic base and shaft has flexibility to it and wobbles unconfidently should you touch or move it. It does not feel like a $50 fan. Unless the motor is of such lasting quality and will still run to cool me when I get to hell, I think you can do as well with one half its price."
1,"Cheaply made, won't last long","I bought this fan last season after visiting all of my local stores and not finding the kind of fan I'm looking for. I use a fan for white noise at night and my apartment gets really hot during the summer, so I needed something noisy and very strong. This fan fit the bill -- for the two months that it worked. The motor burned out after only two months of nightly use, which is simply unacceptable at the price. Also unacceptable is the fact that the parts are cheaply made, flimsy plastic. This fan is strong enough to blow your hair off at high speed, but the cheap legs will break far too easily and the motor won't last. Buy something else."
1,Fan too heavy for the cheap plastic legs.,"Great fan capability.However, the cheap plastic legs crack and the fan constantly topples over.The fan is too heavy for the thin cheap plastic legs.Leg material/design needs improvement.Out it goes in the trash today after sitting around unused for some time. Perhaps someone will salvage it and can rebuild the legs and get some good worth out of it.Too bad...the fan is a great, powerful machine."
1,"Good fan, horrible legs!","This fan moves a decent amount of air, and worked well until a leg fell off while in use. It tipped over, and the fan blade broke into pieces, plus both protective cages were extensively damaged. Very poor design of legs - set up for material fatigue and or the legs simply falling out. Worse yet, Holmes didn't even have the $5 replacement blade in stock, and probably won't until the warm season is almost over."
4,Anthology of German Poetry,"This is a great book of German poems along with their English translations.I had previously taken this book out of the library so often that it finally occurred to me that I should have it on my shelf. I enjoy picking it up from time to time and reading from it. It is always such a pleasure to spend a moment or two with such giants as Goethe, Shiller and Heine to name a few.If you like poetry, then this is a book you will want to have in your collection."
2,good in theory...,"You can pedal for about 30 seconds before all of the nuts and bolts loosen and the thing turns into a bucket of random parts. However, it is a good starting place if you like the benefits of it's size and portability and are willing to go to a little extra work to fortify it so that it doesn't fall apart. Maybe just a few lock washers and/or JB Weld would do the trick."
5,It has been worth the wait.,"I have made multiple attempts to get hold of this work in the past. I came to see that it must be a guarded secret. Finally reading it, I see that it serves as a useful reminder for me, which I can find easy application in life. I finally purchased it at a meaningful time with sychrynous events running rampent. My Wing Chung instructor has been in touch and reminded me too relax. This is know as a textbook, for a reason. It is not one of those textbooks you should expect to find in a used bookstore. Owners will pass them along, not sell them. So, it is not impossible to find them used, but certainly not without chasing."
5,For someone who wants to do more than read another book,"I wanted to do more than just read another book. This book takes sample nutrition, racing, and workout plans from Suzie herself. As a recreational runner I was nervous whether or not this book was really something that I needed to read as it is geared toward racing preparation. But, my friend who recommended this book insisted that I read it. I don't want to outline the book for you, but if you are looking for some direction to a combination of nutrition, rest, and performance, this is the book for you. This book also focuses on performance rather than just moving along, and I think that is a key element that has enabled me to re-evaluate my lifestyle. I would strongly recommend this book to a runner (or any other athlete, regardless of their sport) whether beginner or intermediate (I cannot say advanced b/c I'm only intermediate). It has helped me so much. Well worth the money and time."
5,"Omar ""Free as a Bird""","What a truly gifted artist! Omar's CD, Free as a Bird, is hauntingly beautiful. I could hardly wait until my copy of this CD arrived so that I could ""rip"" it to Windows Media Player. After that task, I downloaded the entire CD to my MP3, so that I can listen to it while I am working out at the fitness center. What relaxing music Omar has composed. I play it over and over and never get tired of any of the eleven songs on the CD. My next task? To find out where Omar is performing and enjoy a live performance."
3,"Its good, but you should know the source!","Listen, Kikaider is a anime based on a manga, as well as the live action Tokusatsu (think of power rangers with a better, more teen/adult/anime/ story). Kikaider 01 is more or less viewed easier seen and knowing the subjects stated above. Though, its not released in the U.S."
4,"excellent stethoscope, excellent value","My stethoscope that is going into retirement I have had for 20 years! So, I was a little skeptical as to how this Sprague stethoscope would measure up, but, I am happy to report it is performing well. I do think my ears had to ""adjust"" to how this one fit my ears. I think it has very good sound quality. The color, though not the reason I made the purchase, certainly gets positive feedback and everyone knows who it belongs too...though I will share. Overall an excellent stethoscope with excellent value!"
3,It works,"it works. Heartbeats through it are not real loud, but they are audible. I wouldn't want to wear them long, they aren't very comfortable. But for no more often than I need them, they do the job."
2,Didn't Make it to My Top Shelf,Impressive treatment in that it takes one small aspect of history and fully fleshes it out. Surely a fine work for academics. Boring beyond belief and provided me with little applicable new knowledge.
5,Bought these to go with the Klean Kanteen- awesome,"I bought these to go with my son's new Klean Kanteen for an even higher flow option. It is slightly faster, but even the original green ones are surprisingly easy. He loves them- easy switch from the soft straws he was using. The only liquid that can make it out is what remains in the spout above the gasket after the child stops drinking- miniscule. At last, my couches are dry LOL. My son is not frustrated by it, even I would use it! It also dissembles and reassembles very easily so you can clean it very well, which was something I did not like about any of our previous sippys. Highly recommend."
3,Just OK,"I bought these for my son's Kleen Kanteens. We already had the green, hard spouts from AVENT. I can't tell much of a difference between the two. Save your money if you already have the green spouts from AVENT. BUT, these work perfectly fine and if you need need new spouts, these would work great, too=)"
1,Maybe Its just my kids but...,"I bought Avent bottles because of their ability to be used as sippy cups. Trying to save myself a little cash and the nuisance of more cups. Alas, my kids just have no interest in these what so ever. Not to mention Avent bottles barely screw together so my kids can way too easily take the tops off. If I could go back I would have bought a different brand of bottle. Ultimately a waste of money."
4,Works fine,"It seems to work fine although there is the potential for ""spills."" My son has figured that if he sucks and then quickly pulls it out of his mouth, he can get the drink to ""spill"" all over himself. He thinks this is great fun but we don't always agree with him. We decided to go back to the 12+ months spouts for a little longer."
1,They don't just leak they pour,I bought these to use with my Kleen Kanteen's - and although they do fit they leak like crazy. If the bottle is not upright the water just flows out. I was so disappointed.
2,"Magic cups are a great idea, but mine leaked around the handle","The versatility of magic cups is a great concept, but the seal needs to be tighter where you connect the handle and the lid. Mine leaked all the time, to the point where I hardly used them--or the sport spouts. No leaking around the spouts though, so if your cups don't leak to begin with, then you should be okay getting these spouts for your older toddler (with teeth)."
5,Sticky,"This is good tape, and invaluable around the office. I like the 3/4-inch size, cause it's big enough for almost every job. And Scotch tape is the stickiest I think (without being so sticky as to be unmanageable). If you have these refills, then you never have to worry about running out."
2,Delta Could Have Done Better,"Over the last year I have purchased an entire shop of Delta Equipment. The Delta 14"" Band Saw was my finishing touch to complete my shop. After receiving the my Band Saw I quickly ordered the riser kit and the rip fence. The riser block installation went smoothly; however, upon installing the Rip Fence I found that quality of construction of the rip fence was not worth $20. I felt very ripped! This product falls into the Toy Category and is absolutely not worth the asking price. I am currently looking for another band rip fence to replace the Delta Rip Fence. Delta should have made this product at the same level of quality as the saw itself. The housing that slides down the bar jambs and it made of pot metal."
4,Synopsis,"Marta Broderick is a beautiful, successful art dealer with many secrets - for starters, she's dating a married woman. Marta is also intent on completing her friend Manny's unfinished business, recovering pieces of art stolen by the Nazis. Meanwhile, she meets the gorgeous but mysterious Judith."
5,Great for the older child,"This book is a wonderful compilation about St. Patrick's day. It includes factual information about the saint and the holiday, and a host of the holiday's traditions are explained."
5,GREAT author for kids (and adults),"All of her books are wonderful about the origin of holidays and how today's traditions come from those beginnings. Her other holiday books also do a great job in combining religious and secular traditions. I have bought all of her holiday books becuase they teach ME things I never knew about those holidays (and I'm Irish!). I have all her holiday books and as my kids get older, I will buy her books on other subjects if my children show interest in those areas. I really hope she writes a 4th of July book."
4,Still MacDonald,"Written before the Travis McGee series, most stories worth a look, and none of them are dated, despite being written long ago. Best one is the title story, in my opinion."
1,Oh my god....,"So I was in best buy looking for another cd and thought i would pick this one up, cause they didnt have to other one....i can sum this cd up in 2 words, it sucks. i am extremly dissapointed with this cd which is now sittin in a box in my closet, yes its that bad. plus the bonus cd is only the whole first cd with a lil bit of mix in it..again, crap....."
4,Very helpful,"I thought the video tapes were very helpful in rounding out my studying for the Miller's Analogy Test. It helps you with different tips, and goes over many questions with thorough explanations. The tapes gave me a sense of calm and security before I took the test. Recommended highly."
3,Good band...should have been huge in the 80's.,"I bought this CD because I took a chance while living in Germany in the 80's and purchases ""Standing Alone"" on vinyl. So, I took a chance on this one too. It's great!! Not as good as Standing Alone, but it's still good!!!"
5,Perfectly Peaceful!,"This was EXACTLY what I had in mind. I wanted a CD that was female only opera, that was soft and relaxing for my reading, sleeping, painting, etc. THIS IS IT! It puts me in a better mood, a more artistic mood, and I fall asleep to it SO much faster with this in my stereo V.S. the radio. Great, great buy!"
5,The best book I have ever read,"I would recommend this book to anyone who is searching for Christ, as a matter of fact I am buying one for my friend in the next couple of days."
1,Ripoff - This is NOT Spurgeon !!!,"What a disappointment to discover this is not the words of Spurgeon but a cheap, imitation paraphrase. Talk about ""dumbing down"" your readership. Integrity would require a disclaimer on the front of the book! Spurgeon himself said the following: Serve God with integrity, and if you achieve success, at least no sin will lie upon your conscience. You lose strength, Christian, the moment you depart from your integrity."""
2,Josh Groban ( With YOU ),"Very short CD. Only 8 songs, 2 of which are repeats from first Josh Groban album. Not nearly as good as album 1."
3,"Eh, It was OK.","I got this album because it was by Josh Groban. Of course we all love him, how could we not. But what you get for the price isn't really worth it."
1,A great introduction to friends,"I've been listening to everything Josh has produced since seeing him on PPBS years ago, this CD is a wonderful taste of Josh for fans and for newbies. I purchased this CD as Hallmark and gave it to a friend for her birthday, she is now a convert. I felt the two new songs are enjoyable, particularly My Heart was Home Again, I keep hitting replay on this one to learn the words. I would also recommend ""Awake"" the newest CD and material by Josh. It did take me a couple of times to get into some of the songs, but now I am enjoying the new direction of this golden voice. I meant to give this 4 stars, can't seem to change that."
1,Too bad...,"-That there are no music samples of this album to hear, it might make the different between purchasing and not. Oh well..."
5,With You,"As a fan of Josh groban for more than 5 years, I can tell you he always gives us his best, and With You is no exception. what an incredible voice!"
1,Awful,"This was the worst book I ever read. I can't imagine anyone taking this nonsense seriously. Not only was it nonsense, it was incredibly boring!"
5,Transfomation by Soul Awareness,The processes presented in this book provide very clear and direct techniques for accessing your soul's energy. Contact with the soul provides a transformative experience where issues of separation are integrated in the light of the soul. I found the audio tapes with guided versions of the techniques to be particularily helpful in accessing issues that needed to be brought into conscious awareness and cleared.
2,Very 101,"This book covers EFT, meditation, NLP, kinesiology and several other emotional/spiritual therapies. This is good. The descriptions are accurate and helpful. That's the two stars part.The book itself is very poorly written and tries to take on too much while saying a lot of nothing. The first 50 pages of the book are basically an outline (They repeatedly say ""We're going to cover this topic and this other topic later on so keep reading"") instead of getting into the subject at hand.There are a couple good meditations that I wasn't familiar with, but if you have done ANY studying of EFT/TFT/NLP/kinesiology or any of these type processes, skip this book. There is nothing new in either the words or the ideas, just a rehash of everyone else's stuff.However, if you have NOT read any other books on these subjects, this would probably be a good primer and lead you to some more in depth study of these fascinating and VERY useful therapies."
5,Awesome Spooky Book!,"This is one of the best Spooky books around! The majority of the stories in Spooky New York have morals tied to their endings so you actually finish the story by learning a lesson. There are some very genuine scary stories in this edition that people will enjoy. Those stories are Observatory, The Satin Dress, The Hermit's House and High Hat. I think that the stories that have the best morals are Redemption, The Poker Game, The Gold Tooth, Baker's Dozen and The Loup-Garou's Debt. I recommend this book for all those Spooky fans out there and also for those who want to know some folklore from New York!"
3,Regional Haunts,Enjoy short regional tales that entertain and inform. The legends and lore in SPOOKY NEW YORK will haunt your imagination while providing insight into earlier days.
2,Not much in certain areas,For a book that claims to be New York there are stretches of the state it does not cover. The closest location to me it covers is 100 miles away.
2,cheap,well if you want them to look nice and not use them there great but they don`t hold up to everyday use got them in good time just not a good product
4,Good value and fit my truck seats well,"I bought this pair of seat covers to protect my seats from my dog's dirty feet. This pair fit my 2004 Mazda B4000 bucket (might as well be a Ford Ranger) seats very well with minor alterations. I don't much care for the Mortal Kombat dragons, but the seat covers were inexpensive and do the job. I can't comment on durability; however, if they seem well made."
4,Excellent,"These seat covers are great! I have them in my 2006 Mazda3 - and they make the interior look amazing! My interior was already mostly black, but all of the dials and lights are red, and these really bring the whole interior color scheme together to make it VERY cool. I love it.I only give it 4 stars though because I don't think the covers are as universal as they could be. The back is almost perfect, but the actual seat part has a bit too much fabric. No matter how I tried to fold it, the seat had about 4 inches of extra fabric that just flails around, kind of annoying to me.It's a minor annoyance though, especially in light of how well they enchance the look of my interior."
3,"Ok, but odd.","The book was fine but it was strange to see a little boy sitting by the window through all different kinds of weather. Even my 4-year-old asked, ""It's snowing. Why doesn't he go outside to build a snowman?"" ""It's a sunny day, why doesn't he go outside and play?"" The reason he's waiting is revealed at the end, but it is weird that he waits *so long*.The weather terms are very simple and explained clearly."
4,Interesting Book for Kids,"My son - just now five - really enjoyed this book. It shows a boy - William looking out his window as the seasons progress. The pictures are colorful and up-to-date. This book would be enjoyable for parents and kids alike. The flow of this book plus the ""cool"" pictures make it better than average bedtime reading and the with the weather the way it is these days - expanding your child's weather vocabulary seems like a good idea!"
2,like water,"I was disapointed that this product didn't live up to the reviews. I have previously used Pantene products but can no longer find the leave-in-conditioner in the stores. This stuff is far inferior to just using regular conditioner. It looks like water, leaves hair tangled, and makes your hair feel like you need another shampoo. I won't be getting any more of this."
2,"Musically it's Ok. Theologically, it's Calvinism. Bleh.","The songs are catchy enough if you like acoustical, Christiany, coffee-house type music. The group's Calvinism is a bit much and hard to take, but that's a prelude to a theological debate more than it is a critique of the music. I just caught myself singing along while my brain was checked out. Then I started thinking about WHAT they were saying and I thought to myself, ""Uh. Nope."" And then I traded in the CD."
4,Can anything good come from Texas?,"The answer is yes. I had the opportunity a few years ago to drive through the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia. I popped this tape in and the mixture of elevating tunes and the glorifying scenery brought a range of emotions in me. My favorite song is ""Bus Driver"". It brings to light the fact that we must make the most of every opportunity to love. It also has that tinny saloon sound to it that makes one feel they are in another time and round.If you enjoy some music that sings to your heart and reminds you of the love that has come...give this album a shot."
5,A Classic,I bought the tape a while back and really loved it. It was practically all I listened to for a long while.Then it got lost. I haven't listened to it for over a year at least. Then I heard one of their songs a while back and i realized how much i really liked them and missed listening to their music. Its really great music. And I really love the lyrics to. They are one of the best Christian bands out there.
2,"fairly nice, but not as pictured","I should have looked more closely at the description--the item is NOT what Amazon has pictured. For the price, it is not as nice as what is shown. Still, it's cute enough."
5,This book was the only one I needed to know all about birds!,"I don't need to buy any more bird books. Of all the previous bird books I read, this one summed them all up into one. It's easy to understand and you don't need any more bird care books than this!"
5,Snowed In for the Holidays ...,"If I had to buy one Christmas album, it would have to be this one. Snowed In by Hanson is one of the finer Christmas CDs to be released within the past decade.20th Century Masters (Universal) re-released this album with new cover art, CD art, lyric book, and a new written message from Hanson. The Title proves that this CD in indeed a great collection of Christmas songs that no one should be without!"
2,"i really like linksys, but:",i did not expect i would be writting this review for this product. my initial experience was very good and the product performed as advertised. Unfortunately some where along the line the software suffered the same fate as other customers. that is the client software crashes and refuses to run under xp pro. the online tech support is useless and the fact pages clearly are not addressing this problem. it makes the product useless and a nice paper weight. for background i have tried re-installing the software and .net many times to see if i could fix the problem (by the way the uninstaller also crashes so this is a manual process) with no success. i really like linksys products as they are doing some neat stuff but it is clear they are having some real technical support issues. make sure you can get a refund if you buy this product!
3,"When it works, it's great; the software needs improving","When it works, it's great. I won't duplicate all the positives and features mentioned by other reviewers.As many other reviewers have said, the TV interface is basic, the remote is more complicated than it needs to be, the unit doesn't support Windows XP Internet Connection Firewall, and the email support, in my experience, is completely incompetent.I also have problems with the software that runs on the PC. I have about 18,000 MP3s + JPEGs. When my machine reboots, the WMA11B's XWPCHostService.exe consumes 99% of my CPU for the first 10 minutes after boot. It also consumes over 100MB of memory.Finally, XWPCHostService.exe watches for new files. When a new file appears, such as a new JPEG, it opens it to do some kind of cataloging. This unfortunately interferes with a photo downloading program I have that downloads an image and then rotates it if necessary."
1,LinkSys the worst for the money,"This has got to be the worst Media Product I've ever purchased, poor documentation, and Wireless section does not work at all, It can't see all my MP3 music files and not worth the price I paid period, no customer support to speak of, and the last Linksys product I will ever purchase. Don't make the same mistake like I did thinking this company makes good products because it's not just about the product it's about what happens if there should happen to be a problem, as I found out there is no support for this product, they rely on a consumer forum for consumers that are having problems, what a joke, this thing was not $29.95 item, yet thats the kind of service you can expect, save your self some time and never purchase from Linksys, I know I won't .............Linksys WRT160N Ultra RangePlus Wireless-N Broadband Router[[ASIN:B000BTL0OA Linksys-Cisco WRT54GL Wireless-G Broadband Router (Compatible with Linux)Linksys WRT54G2 Wireless-G Broadband Router"
1,misrepresented by linksys,"Linksys' press release for this product touts interoperability with the Rhapsody music service (see http://www.wi-fitechnology.com/printarticle315.html or search for wma11b and rhapsody). However, after spending an evening updating drivers, tweaking settings and having an incredibly frustrating online conversation with Linksys support, I have been told that Rhapsody compatibility is impossible with this device. The technical support representative I spoke with claimed that this feature is under development, with no definite timeframe for release. Since this device has been on the market for more than two years, and it's price is plummeting, I suspect they're simply retiring it instead.In addition, the television interface is slow and clunky, the documentation is poor, and the remote is very cheap.There are much better options available."
1,"Decent hardware, horrible software","I have had the WMA11B for over a year now. It is the worst piece of consumer electronics I have purchased in 20 years. The device itself is nice. It is small, connects easily, and sounds good. The PC software on the other hand is pathetic, and even worse, Linksys has essentially abandoned this device. Others have written about XP SP2 problems, but Linksys is clearly over their head in this market. This device only works with obsolete versions of Microsoft .NET. Microsoft has released at least two versions, plus fixes, beyond the version supported by this. The host software also has trouble when you rip new music and add to the managed folders. The Linksys loses track of huge portions of the music folders until you reboot the computer. Very amateurish effort by what otherwise is a decent company. Stay away."
1,This is a TOY!!!,"I was able to get the Media Adapter to ""sync up"" or find the application on my host computer MAYBE 1 out of 50 attempts. Otherwise it wouldl just stall and say ""Waiting for Host"" on the TV, even with signal strengths of 90%. When I did get it to work, it bogged the router/access point down so much that my router could not maintain the WAN connection to the Internet and my PC (also connected wireless) could not connect to the access/point router. My network is entirely Linksys so their tech support had no excuses and no answers for me other than return it to the store. This is one technology I was very anxious for but appears will have to wait a while on."
2,Good while it lasted,"Short and sweet review... incidently, just like the life of my WMA11B media adapter. It worked fine for about 3 months, then steadily begin failing to respond to the remote. Changed the batteries repeatedly, to no avail. Now it won't even turn on with the power button. Time to RMA.While it worked, it worked fine. If you go in with the expectation that this will only play songs through your home stereo, you won't be disappointed. If you're expecting any type of bell or whistle, this product isn't for you."
2,Incomaptability with firewalls is a serious drawback,"The idea behind the WMA is great. But it has a serious problem. You cannot use it if you use the Windows XP firewall.I just contacted the Linksys technical support chat and they confirmed that you can't do it. The box in which the adapter comes provides no warning, and the installation instructions mention the firewall problem way back on page 35 in Appendix A.One would be justified in wondering whether the product is technically smart and whether the packaging and instructions might not be more transparent."
1,Great idea - Poor execution.,"The product workd mostly as advertised; install software on host PC, install WMA11B adapter, configure and you're up and running.The problems came for me when trying to add music. My ""My Music"" directory could not be added, using the utility to do so resulted in an error. Sub directories of my music could also not be added. LinkSys tech support suggested moving all my files in to a directory that I could see; not practical, but so be it.Then I added new music to my collection, in the directory the device could see. Of the 20 files added, it only saw 5.So I have a device that will not see the music I have, and will see only some of the music I add.LinkSys tech support tells me there's nothing that can be done about this... Too bad. I am returning this product."
1,bah!,"Sent it back. This was a miserable device, isn't compatible with SP2 or any non-Microsoft products. Menus load horribly slowly, confusing reboot/config cycle."
1,Lacking flexibility - Requires using the TV to operate,"I bought this thinking that Linksys was a smart and nimble network equipment vendor for consumers - Oops was I wrong! I have no idea why the 'Ready' light continues to flash, nor why the Adapter Utility application doesn't allow control of the device without standing in front of the TV to select playlist, music, etc. Installation however wasn't much of a problem and the device was able to locate the wireless network (also Linksys based).Bottom line: You must have a TV connected into the adapter for user access and operation :-( ."
4,Not bad for the right price.,"In order to do a lot of MP3's on this you have seperate them into seperate sub folders(ie A-H,I-M, etc) Seems to have a 28 subfolder limit per folder.Still locks up for me on Pictures, but maybe I need to do the same with the pictures I did for the MP3.Otherwise works with WEP and I even have the utility installed on a Server 2003 server, seems to work fine. Does have to be local disk access as network folders do not work.It's not a $200 media center, but for the right price it does the basics."
2,Not ready for prime-time,"It turns out that it's fairly easy to set up -- if you totally ignore the instructions shipped with the unit! The easiest way to set it up is to connect it directly to your TV/stereo and use the remote control to set it up (rather than the complicated connect-to-your-PC approach they recommend, which doesn't work unless you are lucky enough to have your PC setup exactly they way they expect -- which might work if you own a linksys router and haven't done any changes, but is unlikely to work otherwise).Warning though: it does not work with newer computers. Turns out it doesn't support the latest Microsoft Windows updates."
3,Good first try,"The TV display is the weak point of this promising product. Track and album names are cut off at 20 characters, which isn't always enough. Example: ""Joe Blow's Greates..."" is a problem if you own Volumes I and II of Joe Blow's Greatest Hits. It would be better to display the full names, dropping the font size a bit if necessary.For classical music, the Artist / Album / Song hierarchy doesn't make much sense, especially since the PC software insists on putting the composer in both Composer and Artist, and ignoring the actual conductor, orchestra, soloists, etc.Tech support, as others have noted, is worth what you pay for the call, i.e. nothing. These guys know literally nothing about the product; they're just trained to look up something on a screen and parrot it back to the caller.Finally, there's no screen saver, and the fixed portions of the display don't move or change color. I'm worried about burn-in on my expensive rear-projection system."
3,WMA 11B & Service Pack 2 Solution!!!!!!!,"I read this from a CNET post and did exactly what it says and it WORKS!!!! Like many of you, I too went the Linksys support route..... Never got anywhere and wasted 2 hours over three days! I love my media adapter and after the support I didn't received, I'll be spending a little more for something that's not labeled Linksys when I make my future wireless purchases. I hope this help all of you WMA11B owners in the same boat!Right, here goes !!If you add ALL 10 .exe files from ""C:\Program Files\Linksys Wireless-B Media Adapter\bin\"" under the exceptions list for the firewall, it seems to allow the device to connect to whatever PC you're using as the HOST that may be running XP SP2.For added security you can then change the ""Scope"" to allow for only machines on your subnet to access the .exe files just added into the list of exceptions.Works for me now without any problems so far !Hope it helps and good luck !!"
1,No support from Linksys,Purchased this item for christmas and had problems with the auto install right out of the box. Attempted to contact Linksys by e-mail and phone without success. My network is very basic and the problem appeared to be software related between XP and this unit. The user manual is poorly done and linksys support was non-existent... wouldn't waste your time with this product.
3,it was a great item at first....,"I installed the WMA11B by myself and it worked great until I downloaded SP2. Then it ceased to work. I spoke with Link-Sys (in Manila) for many many hours and many levels of support only to find out (after getting to the headquarters (Palo Alto, CA) for support) that unless I wipe out my hard drive and reload everything I would not be able to get it working again. I had hired a techie to help me with it @ $75 an hour and the support at Link-Sys assured us a patch to fix the problem would be e-mailed to us within 10 to 15 minutes. This assurance was given on 3 different phone calls after the time limit had passed each time. My hired hand finally left. Five days later Link-Sys admitted there was no patch for the problem and that SP2 had adversely affected the WMA11B. I am stuck with a good media adapter if I buy a new computer or reconfigure my whole computer which I am not willing to do. I have lost all affection for Link-Sys after this."
2,SharedMediaManager Error is Killing Me!!!!!!,"When it worked, this was my favroite device I have ever owned- finnally bridging the PC and The Stereo beautifully... but, then, an error occurred... ""ShareMediaManager"" error. I am extremely proficient with computers but for the life of me, can't fix the problem.Linksys support is worthless, both on the phone and live chat... I am EXTREMELY frustrated!!!!!!"
2,Buyer Beware,"Watch out for Linksys... I had a tech support question for them regarding this product, and they have seemingly outsourced all their support overseas. The reps were totally unhelpful, and were obviously just reading from scripts.I managed to get the problem resolved myself, and the product does work as planned, but I would suggest spending the extra bucks and getting a Turtle Beach Audiotron instead. I wish I had."
3,OH NO XP PACK2 = NO WORKIE,it doesnt work with service pack 2 xp. and if you have itunes it doesnt work with that if you bought your music from them. DAMIT APPLE!!! In any case call the linksys people and check to see if your music service works with it...gee itsnt it funny that all them songs I downloaded from Napster {before they got shut down} work fine..oh well Also the linksys service people and support are SUPER!!!!
4,Christmas gift,This game was a Christmas gift for my husband. He is new to Sony PSP games and he has had to get used to the controls but he seems to enjoy the game overall.
4,All the best of MoH in perfect PSP size,"I love Medal Of Honor. Something about killing Nazis, who represent pure evil, set against the backdrop of the Greatest Generation, makes this a great franchise. I recently got my PSP, and was looking for a new game for my trips. The price could not be beat, and, much to my surprise, neither could the gameplay.First, it was far more detailed than I imagined; almost no change in graphics from PS2. Second, the missions are alternately easy and hard, giving you a good sense of challenge and accomplishment. Finally, the use of the controls is actually good. Shortcuts, like a double tap right to bring up a grenade instead of cycling through your inventory, help a lot.Overall, I just wish there were more missions! Still, after conquering most of Europe, who am I to complain?"
3,Good for medal of honor.,"Medal of Honor for PSP is a good first-person shooter that takes place during World War II and has a lot to offer, from unlockable costumes to plenty of awards. Medal of honor is a must for FPS fans."
1,Junk,"Don't buy this. I bought mine about a year ago and have not used it for 9 months. Since there are no pros, here is a list of the cons:-There is no spout, which means mess!-The lettering washes off early on-The '1 cup' mark is RIGHT at the top of the cup.Overall, I hate it."
3,Not very long,"Yep, it's a 10 pack of familiar Scotch Magic Tape. This is a fine product really; I only mark it down because the rolls are not very long. If you are interested in this tape, the best value is to buy a dispenser and get the 1000 inch rolls of the stuff. Far more economical and less plastic in the landfill."
1,better deal,I did not buy this item simply because I could buy the same 6 rolls WITH THE DISPENSER for 30 cents less!!
3,Way too Pricey!!!,"Way too Pricey!!! I like Scotch brand and needed it in a hurry, but will do better price shopping next round."
5,best tape at a great price,Why would anyone go to staples? This is an incredible value. 6000 inches of tape! I just got this so I could start wrapping xmas presents... better go get started!
4,Excellent for Keeping a Record,"It was a gift from my roommate when I was a music major in college. It definitely doesn't add up to simply buying staff paper when composing, transposing, and all that fun stuff. However, I found this book extremely valuable when I was just trying to organize all of my songs that I was recording at the time.My only complaint - and one that I saw in another review - is that there is simply not enough room for some of my longer songs/lyrics. There is a lined area in the back, though, where I have been able to add additional verses to songs or notes."
3,The Musician's Notebook,"This is not for a serious Musician but would suit the budding muso who wanted to dabble in a bit of transcribing. The parchment paper is beautiful but there is just not enough manuscript. On each page there are lyrics lines, guitar chord boxes, vocal treble staff, piano treble and bass staff and tablature lines and the book is just not large enough to accommodate all this."
3,"Could use some improvement, an easy fix","I like this book's handy size and casual style. The creamy off-white color of the pages is easy on the eyes, and it's printed on recycled paper. There are plenty of staves and the spacing in between is just right. The only thing I don't like is that a clef is added to each stave. I play a C instrument and only need to write in Treble clef. It's a mess to cross out the bass clef and TAB from each stave, then add my own treble clef. It would have made so much more sense to leave the staves blank and allow each musician to add her own notations. The book would have been more versatile that way, and still would have been nicer than a plain batch of manuscript paper. So if you only write in one clef, this book may not be for you. If you need a melody line, bass line, tablature, and space for lyrics, this book is perfect. A simple change could make this book perfect for all of us!"
3,DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE!!!!,I ordered two for Christmas gifts. I only got one but the tracking said they was shipped together. so I got stuck one gift short!!! thanks for nothing!!!
1,Sorely Mistaken...,"I bought this because I thought it would be full of staff paper with little quotes on the side every now and then.What I got was a book of fancy, overpriced lined paper with boxes for guitar chords. I bought two of them (Musicians and Lyricists, because I am a trumpet player as well as a songwriter) and now I'm losing money to ship them back!If you are looking for a notebook with staff paper in it, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS BOOK, NOR ANY OF THE SIMILAR BOOKS BY THIS PUBLISHING COMPANY. If I wanted lined paper, I would have gone to OfficeMax."
2,This is NOT plain manuscript paper,"I thought I was getting a booklet of plain manuscript paper for my kid's music lessons, but it's not. It's kind of for writing songs and stuff. I don't know that a real musician would use this kind of book, it doesn't lay flat open and it's filled with ""inspirational"" junk that seems unnecessary. I ended up going to Guitar Center and buying a plain book of manuscript paper that serves the purpose better."
1,Great Book,It's a great book. All my friends and I use it. I would recommend it to all my yentas out there. It's 5x the size of anything else.
5,good cd,"This is a great cd if you are interested in piano music. I personally enjoyed ""Mesto, rigido e cerimoniale"", which was most famously used in the Kubrick film, Eyes Wide Shut. The rest of the cd is very enjoyable as well."
4,excellent guide to astronomy,"I found this book has a lot of interesting and useful information. It also shows planetary positions till 2014. The atlas is a little crammed at ~2.9mm/degree but not problematic.It is very detailed, going to stellar magnitude 7.5 ,with 2,500 deep space objects.I use it in conjunction with a planisphere and it works really well.I suggest laminating the covers because this book will dog ear with a lot of field use. Overall,this is an excellent resource book."
1,Disappointed in Turkey,"I currently live in Turkey where much of the book takes place. I first became a Karl May fan after reading Through the Desert, published by Bantam books. Therefore it was with much anticipation that I ordered the second in the series published by Nemsi Books. What a disappointment! I feel the translator does not have a thorough enough command of the english language to have translated such a great work of literature. The only thing more disruptive than the translation was the editing. There are typographical and editorial mistakes, not to mention simple grammatical mistakes, throughout the text. (Dare I say on almost every page?) These errors made it extremely difficult to read the book with any fluency. It seems like a rough draft, not something that should have been published, printed and sold on such a quality online store as Amazon. I encourage anyone contemplating buying from this publisher to take caution."
4,A good read,"From Oriental Odyssey II to V, which I have read in the current translations by Michael Michalak, this is the best one.I read it in Portuguese when I was young, and was gladly surprised to find that it still is a good read.The translation of those books is a monumental work, and by doing it Michael Michalak made available again to non-German readers an important part of Karl May books. There are a few small flaws in editing, like typos."
5,"Bidu Sayao, Bachianas Brasileiras No. 5","L gave this recording to a female friend in California many years ago. The last time we met, she says she listens to it every single day, for the sheer beauty and profundity of this composition (music by Villalobos) as well as for the superb artistry of the singer, Bidu Sayao. God bless you... Juan Lucas"
5,"Bravo Bidu, what a voice!","This is one CD that I never tire of, and play it often. I used to hear her recordings in my childhood, and it's like re-newing an old friendship with this excellent disk. I love ""Bachianas Brasileras #5"" most of all (and wonder how it would sound sung by a Counter-tenor?) However, her voice is marvelous, and you won't go wrong in buying it!"
3,sent without any return instructions or a phone # for the store,"This product was sent to us without any information from the store. We had no idea what the phone number was and had to make an exchange for a larger size. Once we got their info., we e-mailed them about the exchange, and they did not have the size we needed. We then asked for the item to be returned. We have yet to receive an e-mail confirming the return or the credit to our account."
5,Great Value!!,My son was the ring bearer in my brothers wedding. It would have cost $100 to rent a tuxedo for the night. I did a little research and found this tuxedo that looked very similar and bought it for half the price. It arrived within a couple of days and it looked great on him! He was the hit of the wedding!!
2,WRONG color!!,"I love these paci's normally. But when I received mine, they were PINK! The picture shown when I ordered was BLUE, not the pink shown even here while I am reviewing it. Amazon told me I needed to contact the seller, they never got back to me. I just contacted Amazon again and this time they said they would send me a postage paid return label for a full refund. We will see what happens. I looks like they have fixed the original problem so good luck. I know the MAM paci's and holders are some of the best I have found, IF they come in the correct gender color."
4,GOOD but wrong color,My son only likes this brand of pacifiers and they are great! Too bad the shipment process put a red color while I liked the blue ones.
1,Deceptive Seller!!!,"Buyer's beware of this Seller! This company sent me a generic 25 ft CAT6 cable (...in plastic pouch) rather than the real Belkin product (...in a hard plastic case w/ Belkin name/info). Further, there was a substantial delay in providing a refund. I will never again purchase a product from this Seller. In fact, this Seller should be banned by Amazon.com for its fradulent practices!"
2,Insufficient power for a 12 gallon aquarium.,"I ordered this heater for a 12 gallon aquarium in my office, which is located in our walkout basement. In the winter, this is a colder room, low to mid 60s. The 25W heater simply could not get my 12 gallon tank to 80 degF; the best it could manage was 74 degF, and this was only when I had warmed my office with a space heater. I ended up having to take the whole aquarium apart again to replace it with the 50W substrate heater, which now keeps my aquarium at the desired 80 degF. So I would recommend to use the next largest power rating up from what Hydor recommends, especially if your aquarium is located in a colder room. You don't want to have to take your aquarium apart again to replace the heater.Note the low rating is for the bad recommendation on tank size from Hydor. Once installed so that they have enough power to heat, these are great."
5,Must have,You must buy this if you like the space marines. The Omnibus is the way to go! Long Live the Omnibus!!!!
3,It was just kinda alright,This is one of those ok book series. The characters were mostly ok none were great. The writting was decent but nothing like some of the other 40k authors. All in all a book that if you can find it cheap or its givin to you then read it. I wouldnt spend the time hunting for it in a store or on amazon unless you just have to read it to have read all the books.
3,An okay work at best,"I'm gonna start with the good things I have to say. The author obviously put a lot of time and effort into these stories, and it shows. It has plenty of action and political intrigue, and would probably make a pretty good movie. That said, it's definately not the best 40K book out there, and given the option, I would buy something else. McNeill is a jack of all literary trades, but unfortunately a master of none. The mix of political intrigue, space age violence, and ancient darkness sounds good on the surface, but doesn't fit together very well. Uriel Ventris is a relatable character, but not someone that makes a good lead role. All things said and done, if you've already bought this book then read it, because it is fairly entertaining, but I wouldn't go out and buy the next one."
4,The ULTRAMARINES omnibus,"I really liked the ultramarines omnibus but I thought dead sky black sun was the best of the 3 books. The space marines were invented to fight the evils and chaoes of the worlds. I just wish I knew witch book came after DEAD SKY BLACK SUN so I could find out the ending of space marine captain Uriel Ventris. Good writing outher wise,this book is just as good as the SOUL DRINKERS OMNIBUS."
3,"Decent story, medicore writing","I love the subject matter, but in my opinion the prose just isn't written to a professional standard. About on par with an aspiring grade B creative writing student at a community college. If you crave 40K, then by all means read it, but if you actually want to read good writing on top of that, stick to Abnett, Kyme, Swallow, King, or Dembski-Bowden, i.e. the professional writers as opposed to the graduates of the tabletop design or White Dwarf writing school."
3,"A fun read, but difficult to recommend to non-fans.","The Ultramarines Omnibus was a fun read, I'll give it that, but not much else. The first novel of the series, ""Nightbringer"", was by far and large the most enjoyable. Equal doses of political intrigue and combat gave the story some much-needed depth. The second novel ""Warriors of Ultramar"" had great bits of action, however a lot of the characters didn't feel fleshed out and ultimately wind up feeling one dimensional. ""Dead Sky, Black Sun"" was a dreary piece, with lots of gore and a pretty substandard 'hero is dishonored, hero fights to regain honor' plot.Don't get me wrong, the Ultramarines Omnibus was a fun romp in the 40k universe, however I would have a difficult time recommending to non-fans as their first foray into the dark and war-torn realm of Warhammer 40k."
1,"First two great, Third book is punishing","I only gave it one star as a warning for the third book.The first two novels move well and are fun to read.The third book is as others have said like reading Dante's inferno or some of the Elric books.It's 200 pages of dismembered bodies and one horror after another, over and over and over.If you want to feel like you're in Hell read the third book. Otherwise, skip it."
4,good service,took 4 days to get this book after i bought it and that makes me happpy i hope its as good as the other books in this series . i bet it well be because the first one was so good
2,not cool,"so ive read esienhorn n that was sweet...but this author mcneil is far from readable, the entire book dances around between like 6 or 7 different people and its hard to follow and oo soo corny...im in the mod of the second book and the enitre book falling apart, binding breaking and the pages are falling out, so i keep a stack of lose pages by my bed so its still sort of a complete book...im gunna finish it cause the game is gunna come out soon adn im weird like that but i would not recomemd this to anyone, the only reason i gave it 2 stars was cause some of the imagery is cool, but seriously dont buy this, get esienhorn or however its spelt and read that author..hes good..also def cet the collected visions horus heresy art book, a little pricy but everything u need to get ur DOW fix n not waste ur time"
2,Not working for me,"I take the pills 4 times/day. I didn't see any noticeable affect at all. A little bit about me, I'm 5 feet 1 and weight 111lbs. I watch my diet, and exercise 5 or 6 days/weeks including jogging, interval training, and weight training. I bought 2 bottles, but after finishing the 1st bottle without seeing any result, I stop using it."
2,Not was i was looking for,"I was very exited when I first product. Finally, i thought, a product that could let me drop those last couple pounds and finally switch from a tight end from a receiver on my football team. Well, I purchased it. I heard something from a friend about it and that prompted me to do more research. I found out that this product is more of a diuretic than an appetite suppressor. This is known as a prom pill. If you take it for a while it will make you look a little thinner but as soon as you stop taking it you will gain the weight right back, so it is not a very practical choice if you want to lose weight long term. If you want to lose weight, I suggest doing P90x. I am three weeks in and have already lost 7 pounds and put on alot of muscle."
3,"works, but makes you waaay too thirsty.","I was dying of thirst after taking just two of these capsules and YES...I was drinking plenty of water. Too strong for me. That probably means it works very well, but it just didn't agree with my system like it may with others. This coming from someone that is an energy drink/stimulant addict."
2,you can do better,"There's no real convienent way to adjust for blade lead without throwing the whole fence out of whack.You make the fence perpendicular to the table by adjusting the rail. Unfortunately that rail has essentially zero play so if it's not close when you get it, you're not going to get it there by adjusting the rail.Finally it includes a little resaw attachment (short steel pipe with a screw to go through the fence). It's only attached at one point and could too easily pivot while resawing which would ruin the resaw. Thankfully with a 3/4"" blade on a well tuned 28-475X, it tracks straight and you don't really need a resaw attachment."
1,A piece of junk,"I bought this fence before I knew anything about band saws, but it did not take me long to find out that every blade, especially small blades, has a drift that is specific to that balde. In order to cut a straight line the drift of the blade being used must be determined and accounted for by making adjustments to the angle of the fence. This toy comes with a 90 degree setting that can not be adjusted. It is obvoius that the manufacturers of this fence either don't know anything about band saws or don't care and rely on novices like I was when I bought it to keep them in producton. They should be ashamed of themselves for selling it.There are lots of good fences out there (Kreg makes a very good one) and this is definitely not one of them. I gave it one star only because it fit my saw."
2,Not the best resource in this area,"This book was heavy on educational and psychological jargon and short on new ideas. Granted that there isn't a large body of knowledge on NLD, but this book doesn't seem to address anything that hasn't been covered by other authors."
4,good technical book for teachers,"not as helpful for 15 year old with NLD, but very good to pass around to teachers and college counselor at school. would recommend this book as well as ""helping a child with nonverbal learning disorder or aspergers disorder"" by kathryn stewart. second book was very good to go thru with 15 year old. very helpful. hard to find books for kids diagnosed at older ages."
5,A Thought to Set Your Day,"The Spirit Recovery Meditation Journal is simple, it is straightforward, and it is fun. One could describe it as a series of meditations to start the day, but they're not the standard meditation. Lee McCormick is, among other things, a surfer and a cowboy, a family man, and a shaman, and a world-class musician. He is also a recovering addict. All of that and a poetic appreciation fot the world around him feed into these meditations. Whoever you are, whether you're recovering from an addiction to substances or an addiction to your own suffering, these will help you. They will help you set your day for a good one, and that's what you need, a good day today. This is a HIGHLY useful tool to achieve that end."
5,The Universal in the Personal,"The Spirit Recovery Meditation Journal tells the stories and experiences of one man, but they resonate with a universality that touches me, and I'm sure many others. Lee McCormick gives us ""90 meditations in 90 days,"" a beautiful set of contemplations to start the day. The book, though directed at people in ""recovery,"" will serve anyone searching for an authentic spiritual path. Besides being wise, humble,and humorous, McCormick has an inviting voice that draws me in. I can't wait 90 days to read this. But I'll return to it for its gentle reminders and nudges toward joy in sobriety."
1,Don't Be Mislead,"Originally, this title was listed as being written by Don Miguel Ruiz. Those who purchased it immediately found that it was written by an alcoholic ""in recovery"" by the name of Lee McCormick. It is actually a 12 step journal. If you do not find AA or 12 step methods helpful, then don't buy this book!"
1,Could Be Any Oster Food Processor,"I have an Oster 3200 food processor that has a broken bowl and trying to find a replacement part has been, shall I say, A WASTE OF MY TIME! Every service center (20+) that I have called that carries replacement parts for Oster appliances have told me that the part was made at one time, but they do not have any in stock and it is not available to order from the manufacturer. I even tried E-Bay without any luck. What a crock. You buy an appliance that works fine for 6 years except for one plastic part and you might as well throw it away or use it for an 11 pound paper weight. I will never buy an Oster or Sunbeam product ever again. But if someone has a bad order base and the bowl is still in working order, I'll buy the bowl from you and pay all shipping....contact me at diniman58@yahoo.com"
2,Spent too much for poor quality!,"My husband and I purchased ours at Lowe's and have only used it about 7-10 times. We spent well over $100.00 on this processor and it has broken in three areas. The sticker that covers the buttons peeled right off leaving the buttons exposed to the elements, inside the handle a piece broke and when washing dishes the plastic bowl slipped from my hands and shattered to bits. For $165.00, this product is below quality standards and should be avoided at all costs! When I purchase something in that price range I expect quality, durability and years of use. They sure don't make things like they used anymore and my hard earned money WASTED. Now I must try to contact Oster for replacement. I just hope their customer service is far more superior than this product."
2,Disappointing,Lacks the power of other food processors. Not very durable. Slicing blade broke the 1st time we used it. Unable to get a replacement blade. Would recommend you avoid this one.
3,Justification for man hating women.,"The author supports her theory that virtually all women hate men. She does not, however, condemn their misandry, but rather justifies their prejudice. Intellectually it has promise, but morally the justification of sexist prejudice is quesionable."
5,Works great,"This is not a replacement for taking a shower and washing your hair, but it does serve it's purpose inbetween showers. I work out during my lunch break and this has been a life saver. My work outs are intense and I work up a GOOD sweat. I just pour this all over my head, take a damp towel and massage it in, then blow dry. It takes away the greasy/sweaty look and leaves my hair smelling and looking clean. It does, however, build up if you don't shower and wash your hair regularly."
1,Doesn't feel clean,"I tried this. It didn't work for me but it might work for others based on all the good reviews it has on amazon. It's probably only for certain hair types (maybe shorter and less oily hair). My hair gets oily quickly and when I use this the day after a shower, It doesn't feel clean. It leaves a sticky feeling in my hair and it still looks oily. It also weighs my hair down. The only plus is it smells nice. Powder dry shampoo may be another option, but I haven't tried that one yet."
3,I use it on my dog...,"My dog is getting older, and let's just say hygiene isn't her primary concern (or even a vague interest) anymore. Her little girl parts get kinda gnarly as she doesn't clean herself. I've used baby wipes and those sturdier microwavable disposable washcloths, but thought I'd try this. It's OK. I did end up rinsing it just because I didn't want the residue back there in case she decided to go all 'bikini line' licking in the vicinity (which she didn't- just sat down incredibly quickly as the air hit her wet backdoor). I doubt I'll reorder it again for her, but I'll use up what I've got."
3,Good for short hair.,"No Rinse Shampoo lives up to its name. I've been unable to washmy hair because of illness. For short hair, it should be just fine. I have long hair and ran into a lengthy shampoo because itwas very hard to keep all the hair wet. Because of that, I had nolather. I did manage to wash my hair but blue stains which washed out were left on the towel and my hair took a very long time to dry. However I would use it again if my hair were shorter or on someone else who had short hair. The amount of shampoo needed forlong hair is too much. I would recommend it for someone bedriddenif another person were doing the shampoo."
4,works great !,Follow the instructions - use enough so you get some foaming action when you scrub your scalp and towel dry your hair very well. I use it when I am in a hurry or miss my alarm!
2,Didn't work for me,I have thick hair that tends to get slightly greasy if I don't wash it everyday so I thought this would work for not washing my hair for a day. Turns out it just made me hair feel heavy and greaser and more unclean. So not for me I guess.
1,Left my hair horribly greasy,"I ended up wheelchair bound for two months and thought this would be the easiest way of washing my hair. It was terrible; no matter how much product I used, my hair never smelled or felt clean. I threw away both bottles. Find a different product."
1,Disappointed,"This should not be called ""no rinse"". I literally thought it would require no water, but after applying it to your hair, you still need to clean it either with water or wet towel...not worth it."
3,i bought this because i didnt want to use water when i had braids,it saids no rinse shampoo but i had to use water i wanted a product tht i could just rub in and wipe out with a towel but i ended using water so it wasnt what i wanted i say buy a regular shampoo and conditioner
5,"Thought it would be ""another"" dry shampoo that got thrown in the trash but it wasn't","I've tried allot of these types of products (should mention I'm a hair stylist & can get many hair products at half price or less) & even the so called ""expensive brand named ones"" to me I hated. They all stunk & looked like I dumped a bottle of baby powder all over my hair. With allot of good reviews on here I decided to give this one a whirl. Loved it! Yes, you do have to lather it until your hair is pretty wet but it WORKS (for me anyways) & I have very fine/kind of oily hair. Sure beats washing it every day & styling it over & over each day. Not to mention doing that every day really drys out & damages it. This doesn't. I recommend it for sure."
3,some great hikes,"i liked this guide book but there were a few hikes in there that weren't described as well as they should have been. it has good maps and the descriptions are spot on. however a few of the hikes considered ""moderate"" were a little more vigorous than described. for example, she describes the great head trail with ""moderate scrambles"" along the boulders. i'm an avid hiker and this was a little more than ""moderate"". it does come with good advice, though. i would recommend this book."
5,Saved me $10,"Although I am not completely attached to my home office tape dispenser, it was great that I could find a cheap(as in not costly) and satisfactory replacement for the broken core. I looked at all types of new dispensers, but finding one that was compact, professional looking, and with a heavy base netted 0 results. Plus replacing just the core and not having to purchase a new dispenser saved at least $10 and is good for the planet as well, I guess."
4,Recycled,"Made in JAP in 2002, Serial# MUCD-1055, Playing Time 62:18The english title of this 15-track compilation is in fact ""Asian Café"", and gathers 15 tracks from KITARO's solo albums, up to the great ""Ancient"" and ""An Ancient Journey"" albums.It also includes 2 tracks from the ""Kitaro's World Of Music Featuring Yu-Xiao Guang"" album. As is the tradition with most of KITARO's albums, the tracks are generally linked without pause in sound.This album covers many albums from the ""Geffen"" label era, without presenting anything unreleased...It makes for an expensive ""best of"", so perhaps a more affordable album like ""Ten Years"" or ""Thinking Of You"" makes for a better introduction this to this man's spiritual music..."
3,Lacking Quality,This what I ordered and I should have known when I paid for it that the quality of materials would be lacking. It will however work well for me. It looks very nice and has a variety of uses.
4,Good value and cooks well.,"This oven is a good value. We needed to cook a ham and a turkey for Christmas dinner and have just one oven. The turkey was 19 lbs and the lid wouldn't quite seat on the cooker even though the turkey was within the weight parameters for this roaster. I had to weight the lid down to keep it shut. It took the same amount of time to cook as the oven and the turkey came out browned and beautiful. I do wish it was okay to use a brown in bag but it isn't recommended. I do recommend this roaster oven over the Oster I used to have. Also, the bonus buffet pans were great for serving with our large crowd!"
5,Simply the best!,"You do have to replace it about once a month, but nothing beats this exfoliating towel. It's very easy to scrub your own back even if you've skipped your yoga classes for a while and it foams up as well as puffs.Wouldn't be without one!"
5,funny,a few tiny translation flaws (or so i believe) but i like it and really look forward to reading the next many volumes of galaxy angel^^
2,Not as nice as the rest of the Malawi line,"We were pretty disappointed in this rug. For one thing, it simply will not stay put on the floor. We have tried throw rug adhesive and everything, yet it constantly moves around, flips up, etc. Also, the pattern is not as cute as the rest of the Malawi line. The colors of the animals are much more muted and, with no pinks or purples, the rug looks drab compared to the rest of the room. As impressed as we are with the rest of what we purchased from the Malawi line, this rug is a disappointment."
2,Disappointing,"I agree with some of the other opinions. This rug will simply not stay put. I've even tried putting one of sticky rug underpads to keep it from scooting around the room. No good. Maybe the underpad would work on a solid surface floor rather than the carpet in our home.Love the rest of the Malawi line, but I would not recommend or ever purchase the rug again."
5,This little thing is awesome.,I love to put this thing up my sleeve and pull it out randomly xD Id recommend this to anyone who loves a quality instrument even if its as small as penny whistle!
3,Harder than I thought,"The instructions are really much help. The whistle itself is so-so, according to a friend with a bit more experience in tin whistles than me, but it works fine for a beginner. Tends to squeak on a couple notes."
1,Even more disappointing.,"Also thought there were many pictures. There were few, and the ones present were tiny."
1,"NOT the version to get... instead, get the $45 Feb 2002 version","This is the one to get: ""Born Free and Equal: The Story of Loyal Japanese Americans"", by Ansel Adams, Wynne Benti (Editor), Sue Kunitomi Embrey (Contributor), William H. Michael (Contributor), Archie Miyatake (Introduction), Hardcover: 128 pages; Publisher: Spotted Dog Press; Hrd edition (February 2002); Language: English; ISBN: 1893343057Editorial Reviews (of the Feb 2002 version)Mary Street Alinder, Adams' manager and biographer""Magnificent . . . Ansel would have been proud."""
1,Awful,"This movie is a waste of time. The protaginist is a selfish nitwit who has done nothing with his life. Why anyone would want to write a story about this boob is beyond me. The end trieds to vindicate him but, in the end, it only shows that his life has been one big mess. A person would be better off doing anything else than watch this nonsense."
2,Good God!,"I think Giamatti is a truly great actor and he does a fine job in the film. As for the film itself, a total horror. I could not appreciate the acting when applied to this bummer of a story. Certainly would not recommend this to any one except for those who are too happy all the time in an effort to bring them down to our reality."
1,stunned by the good reviews,"I didn't make it all the way through the movie so I can't comment on last 20 minutes. It's hard to imagine that the end of this movie could have rescued everything that came before. I felt that I had no real connection or affection for any of the characters, particularly Barney, who was desperately self-absorbed. It was impossible to believe that 3 beautiful women would fall for this guy, not only because of his dreadful personality but because he is SO physically unattractive. Aside from really disliking the characters and wondering what the plot was, I thought the pacing was excruciating. After a while I went to the bathroom and just never came back. Did I see the same movie as the 5 star reviewers?"
1,Slow and depressing,"This film was very slow, remarkably depressing, and didn't have a point as far as I can tell. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone."
4,Astonishingly credible characters mostly doing the best they can in their lives,"The tale of the very flawed, very human Barney Panofsky and the very flawed, very human people in his life. Barney undervalues himself and everything he does and seems perpetually afraid of being caught living a life he doesn't seem to feel he earned or deserves. As a result of his fear he breaks what he most values in his life.Astonishingly credible characters mostly doing the best they can in their lives."
5,Barney's Version dvd,"I received the dvd in a timely manner and as advertised on Amazon. Great movie and Paul Giamatti is, as usual, wonderful."
4,Giamatti is a powerhouse,"There is a lot of humor and just as much heartbreak in this tale of a Jewish TV producer with an outspoken father and three women he (the son) loves over the course of 30+ years. Giamatti is spectacular as always, especially as ALZ slowly takes over his mind and behavior. The story is interesting enough to sustain your viewing although the running time is more than two hours."
4,WORTH AS A GOLDEN GLOBE WINNER,"Based on a novel by Mordecai Richer. The film was 12 years in the making and when finally finished several Canadian actors made cameo appearances. Tales focuses on a man in the twilight of his years looking back on his life, most notably those of his three wives with a slight subplot of whether he murdered his best friend or not. The acting is high end and I can see why Giamatti got best comedy actor by the Golden Globe. Rosamund Pike plays his third soulmate wife who isn't able to forgive him (even though one could argue the husband's drunken action was related to her time spent with an associate she later ends up marrying in the tale) but still remains in his life. Dustin Hoffman plays his crass blue collar style father and Minnie Driver is the main character's overbearing second wife.CHARACTER/DIALOGUE: B plus to A minus; STORY/PLOTTING: B minus to B; THEMES: B plus to A minus; OVERALL GRADE: B plus; WHEN WATCHED: today."
3,"Works great, only problem is lack of suitable stand!",It works great as a light modifier. But I find it difficult to use when there is no one to hold it for me. It should have been sold with a suitable stand. Using it outside when there is any kind of wind is out of the question because of the size. I am still looking for a suitable stand.
1,Not very impressive dust collection,"I couldn't wait to get this thing. Now I kinda wish I had.It simply does not do a very good job of sucking dust down into the table. I have a 1500 cfm collector and I shut all of the other ports but, alas, it just doesn't work very well. Not sure there is much that could be done to improve it.Still haven't tried connecting collector directly to this table. That is my only hope at this point. I suspect it will work better but it would have to be a pretty big jump to make a difference. I wil probably end up laying something across the area of the table I'm not using to get maximum suckage. I had expected it to keep the fine dust from gettign airborne. Too bad... it looked like a really good alternative to a dedicated downdraft table."
3,Essays somewhat of a help,"This book, I suppose, serves its purpose. It is 40 essays one after the other. However, if you are looking for any sort of advice in writing your personal statement, look for another text. It seems as though the essays are all basically the same."
3,Just OK,"Contains some very good sample essays - and that's OK if that is all you need. I find that it lacks any specific type of instruction on how exactly to write a good application essay - in other words, it doesn't teach anything beyond what one would probably already know. A far better book is ""Essays That Will Get You into Medical School"" by Dan Kaufman and Chris Dowhan."
5,Perfect for applicants,"I am an educational counselor and received all four of the new ""Essays That Worked"" books recently. These books are perfect for any applicant stumped by or anxious about writing a personal statement. The essays are inspiring, and the advice is frank and fresh. I have recommended Stephanie Jones's ""Medical School Admissions: The Insider's Guide"" to my clients for years, and I will now highly recommend ""Essays That Worked for Medical School"" as well."
5,one of my absolute favorites!,"For flavored tea, it's hard to outdo the flavor-rich Bigelow Raspberry Royale. The flavor continues with the same bag for at least 3 cups (you might have to squeeze the bag a bit after the first 2 cups). The scent is mild and so is the flavor - yet rich and penetrating at the same time. Excellent!"
3,It's Ok. But O'Neil is better,"This isn't the same Medium size as the O'Neil rash guard. It's also got a tighter fit around the wrists. It's harder to get off and on. The quality seems good, but I'd rather buy the O'neil brand. Seem more stretchy and comfy. This is tight fitting. Nice colors. Bought the wood/white/... and what I thought was red was really very bright orange. But it still looks good."
2,Body Glove runs 1-2 sizes smaller than the others,"I love Body Glove. But they run small. And this one ran two sizes small as opposed to one. Of course rash guards are supposed to be like a ""second skin"", and not bag in places, or it defeats the whole purpose. But this was a bit too tight."
4,Review of Women's Long Sleeve Rash Guard,"The product was received on time and in excellent condition. I had to, however, return it because it did not fit me."
1,WAY TOO SMALL!,"This rashguard runs WAY TOO SMALL. I am 5'6"" and 115 pounds. The medium was so tight it barely fit over my head. The sleeves came to halway between my elbow and wrist. These are child sizes."
4,"Pretty color, Pretty design!",It is small and I recommend to order one size up.My size is S but I ordered M.Actually I felt it tight but it was good in the water.
3,White why!,"I don't know why the manufacturer produced this item in white, it soon looked green, grey, yellow, bad. However it does the job of sun protection which is why I purchased it, live and learn right? I am a size 12 and the large was a good fit for me, I think the sizing is accurate."
4,SIZE FOR CHILD FOR A WOMAN arrgggggg,"Nice product I am size medium,8 -9 depending onchina made or?I love this product,but they need to make it clearthe size. I agree with post about thatmedium is TINY TINY ---- more like for a kid,4 ft tall,and about 80 pounds.I mean..it was not even close to a adult size.nice color,nice hard stitching,and good material.I ordered a MEDIUM ADULT WOMAN"
3,nice but quite tight,"As mentioned in other reviews, this rash guard is great looking but a very snug fit. I ordered a small and usually wear a size XS. it is quite snug but works fine when I am paddle boarding or surfing."
1,Unhappy,I recently purchased Revlon color stay ultimate liquid lipstick and I am very disappointed in the product. I purchased it in Fl but I am now in Ohio and can not return it to Target. It has dried my lips and does not feel creamy when I wear the product. It also goes on lumpy. Please suggest what I should do about this product. I wear other revlon lipstick and have been very happy with them.
3,Product quality,I like the color but the quality of the lipstick is mediocre. It's common for it to cake up on your lips after one to two hours of wear. I use it because it does stay red on your lips for much longer than other brands.
2,Will never ever come off your lips,At first I thought I was in love with this lipstick. At least for a couple of hours. It did seem to stay on good at first but then my lips got really dry and lipstick started to roll into balls of what looked like pink glue on my lips. I applied the gloss but it just made it more gooey. I tried to wash it off with makeup remover. I scrubbed so hard with everything I could find and I still had traces of it left in the morning. By then my lips were red and dry. I tried it one last time the next day and it was worse because I think I still had some left on my lips from the night before. Yuck! My lips look like they have aged about ten years from all the scrubbing.
2,Good lipstick,"But the color is not a good one. Its too dark, like purple.I'll try it again with other color."
2,Okay glue but dries up fast!,"This glue does an okay job at being able to stick two surfaces together and obviously it works better on some surfaces than others. However if you are trying to glue wood together I suggest you use epoxy instead of this Gorilla Glue, I have found in my experience that epoxy generally works better than any type of functionality that Gorilla Glue can ever provide you.One major problem however that I encountered in my experience in using Gorilla Glue is that only after a few uses of the glue the entire 4 oz. bottle would just dry up and harden. It became more difficult to use the glue after every use due to its constant hardening. This made me very frustrated as I had barely even used half the bottle and was forced to then throw it away, this is a big drawback of this glue to me. What use is it if there is such a limited amount of time to use it?"
1,Over Rated,"I found Gorilla Glue to be way over rated. Everything that I've used it on eventually came apart. Even when I accidently took the capped off with my mouth (don't try this unless you're a professional), it didn't take long to get my lips unstuck. I'm glad that I just bought a small size of it."
2,Doesn't keep,"The problem with this and the Gorilla Wood Glue is that although they perform very well, they do not keep.The container and cap are poorly designed. Once opened, within a month or two, the entire bottle has solidifiedso for an occasional user like myself, it becomes a very expensive product because I get one use out of the bottlebefore it hardens up on me.Can't fault the product... I glued a block of wood on a wooden gate 3 years ago and still holding strong but I wish they would fix the cap.I bought a small bottle after the first one hardened up on me. The second bottle hardened up inside the bottle before I even had a chance to use it. The product itself works well but it does not keep. They need to market it in smaller bottles or do something to improve shelf life."
3,Best for certain applications - but not what I wanted it for,"I purchased this glue to fix a ceramic bowl. It bonds well but I would not use it again for such a specific application as a fine crack. It's difficult to know how much it will foam, and if you don't wipe away the foam right away it will be almost impossible to remove. I used a very very thin layer and it foamed over the crack in some areas. My husband uses this for projects around the house that don't require a precise look and it works better for that application.The applicator is good but I prefer the much smaller tubes because I worry less about it drying out. If you plan to use a good size quantity of this it would work well, otherwise they sell small sizes similar to crazy glue tubes."
2,Warning....,"Did not hold small pieces of wood together. Also, BE AWARE this glue has been consumed by puppies and dogs, apparently they like the taste, it expands in their stomachs and makes surgery necessary to save their lives."
5,it really sticks.,"This glue is really one of the best. it really works well for me, it has a very useful bottle that can be squeezed for the exact right amount. it is a very thick liquid so it does not run all over your projects when used."
3,Decent glue,"I used the Gorilla glue, and it really leaves alot to be desired, it has most of the usual problems.It takes forever to dry. It doesnt stick to mots surfaces. It foames."
2,Works sometimes,"This glue works fine if you use it in perfect circumstances (temperature, pourous material, etc.) but I find it to be generally unreliable. If you want a glue that works on just about any type of material get a bottle of Sticky Ass glue. That glue performs as I expected this glue to."
2,It might be strong but difficult to work with.,"Gorilla glue might be very strong but it is not user friendly for woodworking. It has some major drawbacks. It is not water soluble so you cannot wipe the excess with a wet rag (I had to use lacquer thinner). It expands quite a bit which means even if you wipe the excess initially, you are still going to have it coming out of the joint. Don't even think about using it to glue anything without using clamps, as the expansion of the glue will cause the parts to move. The bottle cap is cheap and it broke at the bottle when I tried to pull off the cap (which of course glued itself to the nozzle).I've gone back to conventional woodworking glues and the new ones (tite-bond) are very strong so there is no real advantage to Gorilla glue."
2,Good as a filler only,"It's OK as a filler for stripped out holes in wood, before (long before) we used to dribble hot hide glue into a hole and drive in a few wooden slivers to re-screw, but a drop of water and a few drops of GG seem to work as well (we'll see in a hundred years or so!"
5,Amazing glue,This glue is so versatile and so crazy strong dare I say that it is even better than epoxy :)
4,"5 star for strength, 4 star for working properties, 3 star for short shelf life","This glue has its place. I've used it for strong glue bonds of joints using two types of wood, and also for repairing broken book bindings. 5 star - very strong, 4 star - expands and requires some removal of excess before it hardens, and 3 star - what's left in the bottle won't last long."
5,"did I hear somebody say, glue?","I've experimented with glues, and I mean all kinds of glues. Then went to Walmart and purchased the Gorilla Glue to fix the brick that chipped off my steps. I must confess I was a bit hesitant, thinking about past experiences with other glues. Then came home and followed the instructions. OMG. I have to warn you. If you plan to unglue, please don't use this product. This is a bonding glue. Do not fool around with it. It gives me so much fun, just using it for virtually every broken object in my house. I've used it on brick, on wood, on metal, on plastic, on my screen. it glues everything. And takes only two hours to dry. Be careful. This thing can glue eyes together and it will take Dr. Jesus to have them open. Please, be careful with this product around children. In the meantime, let me see if there's something else I need to glue."
4,It does what's expected,This product works well for kids 3 and older that don't have a problem listening to their parents. I kind of think it looks like a tennis net when its expanded. It's more of a visual barrier than a gate.
4,Serving the purpose - SAFETY!,"I bought this for my three year old. He's a runner. Down our driveway. Down the sidewalk. Down our neighbors driveway. Etc. The fence is a great ""visual"" barrier for him and we have not had an incident since we installed.Rating goes to a 4 (not a 5) because there is slack in the fence at the top. And although he COULD crawl over it (the fence does not ""lock"" so it pushes down if he leans on it), he has not. YET."
4,Works for us!,"Product came without ground anchors. After a call, missing parts arrived within a couple of days. Easy to install, and provides a portable fence across the driveway opening. You need to be very deliberate when putting away. If too fast or not straight, the fence lumps up and does not retract properly."
3,great in theory.,We bought this to contain out nearly 2 year old son but he defeated it within 5 minutes. It easily lifts or pulls down so it was more of an obstacle than a containment measure. But it slows him down and stops balls from rolling into the street which is a definite plus.
2,Not great for the money,"For almost $100 with shipping I would have thought the quality would have been better. I use mine to catch balls at the end of the driveway so I don't have to run down the street after them, and it does do that for the most part. It's hard to get it low enough on the ground that it catches the smaller balls such as tennis and base balls. Also you have to be careful re-rolling it so it doesn't get all bunched up and uneven, mine already has a hole in it. Tons of people in my neighborhood have stopped and asked me about it since they were considering buying one and I did not reccommend it for these reasons"
2,Disappointed!,"I purchased this driveway guard and do agree it's a good idea. The main reason for my purchase was so that I would not have to chase balls down our driveway (our house is set up high). I found that smaller balls will simply roll underneath the net. Larger balls have a 50/50 chance of being caught by the net. All in all, this was certainly not worth the $$. i am very disappointed."
3,Alot of money,"I purchased this product and couldnt even believe how much money they wanted for this thing!! They shipped it to me and the first one was broke, so I called n they were VERY nice and shipped out another one immediately and I shipped the broken one back. The second one that I got seemed to be in working order so we got it all set up outside and for the first time that we rolled back in it went in fine. Well every time since then itll go in all the way except about the last foot of it and we have to roll that in by hand so for as much as we paid for it that seemed a little irritating. I figured if it costs this much that it should be PERFECT in every way. I didnt feel like sending this one back too and having to wait on a new one and also I dont have the package to even do that now."
4,recommend it,my only complaints are the storage tray at the top isnt as big as i thought and the center raised letters have a small gap and is a pain to clean
4,A nice course,"I am just a beginner, and this books helps me learn the basics, and encourages me to try and get better."
5,"Great item, narrow from top though","We love this product. My wife looks great in it. Although it's very narrow from the top, so you will need a hand to ware it, and it DOSE NOT stretch, if you have some extra pounds in your thigh, be careful.Still looks great!"
4,Awesome sexy boots~!,"The ONLY thing I didn't like about these where getting into them.I have never worn patent thigh high boot's like those, so for me it was a bit of a struggle to get into them.Maybe I just need to work out the legs. XDAnyways~ They're true to size, VERY EASY TO WALK IN...and are just the perfect thigh high boots!Exactly what I was looking for at an amazing price! :)"
5,wonderful,"supe fast shipping, couldnt believe they ahd gotten it to me so fast hwen i had just picked your average standard shipping and boots were beautiful and well made exactly as they looked in the picture."
3,Very Tall,"Sexy, but too tall for me. I'm 5'3"", and these boots went almost all the way up to my crotch. Since they went so high, they squeezed at a very bad spot (think muffin tops of the legs). I am pretty slim too, so that wasn't the problem. Wish they had them in ""petite""."
2,Look amazing,"I bought these boots for a costume, but I could not zip them past my calves and I don't have fat legs. If you have super small calves they would look great, but they do not stretch even though they say stretch. I had to return them."
1,Great Idea. Horrible Execution. = Waste o' Time,"Seriously, I know you're going to be tempted to purchase this. It looks great. It looks like it would perform a great function. However, it is so poorly executed in its design that please take my word for it and save your time and energy -- it is not worth the trouble. It doesn't go together well, and once up, isn't stable AT ALL. Great concept, horrible execution."
3,Grill Accessory,"I purchased this canopy for my son in law who grills outside a lot. He had to adapt it a bit to fit his grill as it did not fit as easily as stated. It does not do any good if the wind is blowing, only when it might be sprinkling straight down. If the wind is fierce it has to come off the grill completely and once it's off it doesn't always get put back on as it doesn't just slip right on. All in all, great idea but needs some improvement."
1,The Very Best of Julie London CD,Supposed to be a two disk set. Both the original order and it's subsequent replacement contained only one of the disks (Disk Two). I suspect all of your inventory of this item are defective. I gave up trying to communicate this to your customer service. Accepted my losses and got on with life. I still have only half of what I paid for.
3,Leans toward heavy orchestration.,"Her earlier, sparer arrangements are a better match to her slinky voice, IMO.But the quality of these recordings is good, and you get a lot of her standards here, if also some fluff. There are some truly odd omissions for a Very Best Of collection, however. Where are ""Two Sleepy People"", ""Fascination"" & ""Perfidia"", for example?"
4,julie London,This was a singer that somehow slipped under the radar for me. I am so glad I decided to buy a cd of hers. What a terrific voice-very sultry and jazzy. A must have for jazz lovers.
5,Miss Julie At her best,"If you love to hear torch songs as they should be sung, then this is the album for you. You think she's singing to you when she's singing ""Cry Me A River"". You know you're the man as she tells us how she ""Can't Help Loving That Man"". Wow is all I can say."
5,Love it,"Julie at her silky voiced best (when is she not?) love all her collections, a must have for London fans, such as ME"
4,Review of Julie London CD,Grew up with her and Peggy Lee who were the most sensual singers of their time and are still today. Includes many of her signature songs: well done selection and presentation of songs.
5,Lifesaver,The subject says it all. I had to write an A-level coursework essay on Nazi Germany and this book was the most helpful thing I could possbily have had by my side. Thank you Mr Kershaw!
5,GENERALS IN BRONZE,I highly recommend this book. Styple does an excellent job of editing James Kelly's notes and presents a picture of famous generals that is rarely seen. The general's views of each other were of particular interest. I think I will always remember that on the monument at Monmouth that actress Nell Starett posed for Molly Pitcher and that Thomas Edison posed for one of the gunners. These are facts that are little known.
4,For Civil War Buffs,Information from the Generals mouth. Well written and put together. A great idea for those Civil War buffs in your house. It was nice to read the source for a change.DP Lance
2,"this album is bits & pieces from gould's ""greatest hits!""","glenn gould is, for my money, the finest interpreter of j.s. bach on record. the emotion he brings to any of bach's piano works wipes away, forever, the notion that bach wrote only ""mathematical"" compositions. this 2 cd set teases with snatches from gould's other albums. the photos in the enclosed booklet are silly. the comments in the same booklet are a tiny bit better than that. the only reason that i gave this album 2** was for gould's playing which cannot be dismissed. but: buy his other, complete albums. start with the double cd set of piano concerti or either recording he made of the ""goldberg variations."""
4,The Dark Princess by Donna J. Schmidt,"Rescued from an abusive life at the hands of herfather, Cassandra embarks on a tour of new adventures.After nearly being raped by her father, and thenrescued by the mysteriously handsome Prince Dmitri,Cassandra begins to learn about life all over again.After three years, and on the eve of her 18th birthdaythe young lady has found herself in love with the goodprince and him with her.

I look forwardto seeing more from this author!Reviewed by Debi Salanitro, for The Coffee Cramp Reviews"
4,An enjoyable read!,"Deep Blue is one of Kat's earlier novels (2005), but I enjoyed the story line and can see how she has evolved and makes her books more interesting to keep your attention. Just having finished reading four of her latest books for the 2nd time in her ""Against the Wind, Fire, Law and Night series--I am anxiously awaiting Against the Sun."" I love to read books that are in a series that tie characters from a book together. I will save the series, so when her ""Against the ...."" series is complete, I'll be able to re-read them all again in a year or so!"
1,A disappointing book,"Unfortunately, this book had too much sex and too little interesting plot. I enjoy a nice balance and a lot of reality. I think Kat Martin's earlier books were much better."
2,DISAPPOINTING...,"This book had so much potential, but simply didn't deliver. This was a fantastic storyline and the book started out great, but began to fall apart during Conner & Hope's first tryst in bed. This scene wasn't all I had hoped it would be, and all of the love scenes afterward were disappointing as well. It seemed as though Ms. Martin didn't put a lot of thought or time into them, and they all seemed the same. The chemistry and sexual tension I felt in the first part of the book was lost. The dialog started to lose its way as well and became mundane, however, I did love learning about Spanish galleons; I commend Ms. Martin for her research in this area. To sum it up, this could have been a fantastic read and started out that way, but it seemed to fall apart and started to drag. I agree with other reviewers that Hope's cowardice became annoying as well. I'm sorry to say this isn't a book I would recommend."
3,Kind of a drag,"This book was just ""okay""...it seemed to drag on and on and on and...you get the picture. I agree with another reviewer that she seemed to dwell on her ex-fiance WAY too long...get over it already! Frankly, she struck me as kinda stupid to have love smack her in the face and she kept fighting it...her rationale made absolutely NO sense to me! I DID appreciate the obvious research that went into this book and the references to real life expeditions...it's kind of nice to learn something new in an otherwise pleasure read. I won't stop reading this author, but I will definitely read reviews before I purchase."
1,The World's Funniest Golf Songs!,"Purchased this without hearing it. That was foolish, wasn't it? However, there was/is no opportunity to hear it first. The entire album selection is an amateurish simulation of ""the chipmunks"" type sounds...making deprecatory and repetitive remarks about golfers. No brainiacs involved in the compilation of these mindless verses. Music scores all copied...again, amateurishly.Wish we could send it back and try something else. It was to have been the background music for a show for a San Francisco Bay Area Golf Club presentation, and the CD's writers would have been given full credit. No credit will be due here! It won't be used.What a rip-off!"
2,This is TOOL'S WORST CD EVER,"I can't believe that they took 5 years to make this cd. This cd is soooooo not tool material at all. Maynard is too worried about being a bleeding heart liberal and not focused on his lyrical ability and music ability anymore. The lyrics are not so deep and meaningful and there is a song on the cd where maynard's balls sound like there getting squeezed. There also is a couple songs which are just noise, and for taking 5 years to create this album that should not be on there. I think TOOL is running out of ideas for music and this album proved it to me. I love any previous album before especially Undertow and Aenema, even Lateralus was alright, but this one just sucks. I like 2 songs and that's it. Maynard stop being so worried about the war with the rest of the Hollywood Liberals and start focusing back on your music. They should put out another album quick and act like this one never came out."
1,"man, oh man, what will they think of next...",...hopefully a greatest hits cd and one reunion tour...this album was awful. thanks for trying maynard.
3,Haba Kids Outdoor Compass and Tin,"This is a very durable, beautiful looking toy. We bought this for our 3 year old when her older sister was involved in orienteering. She wanted to be just like her big sis and this was a nice alternative to using a ""real"" compass. While this is also a real compass, it's educational value is lost on my little one, being only 3 years old. However, it feels good, it looks good, and most of all, it works. I will put it away until she has a better understanding of what true north really is. All in all, this is a good product."
4,A Cut Rodeo undermines an otherwise excellent bargain,"For the most part, this is an excellent CD, with great performances throughout. Of note is Andre Previn's moving, wonderful account of the Red Pony suite, bringing out much more of the work's excitement than Copland's own more measured, standard reading. Unfortunatly, the dance episodes from Rodeo are a dissapointment. First, there are only three instead of the customary four episodes, and, even stranger, a large part of Buckaroo Holiday is cut towards the beginning. For the other works on this CD though, this is a fine purchase."
5,Should be played nationally more often.,"Copland's works are so USA. Western states seem to appreciate him more. His ""LIncoln' Portrait"" should beused be presented often."
4,Entertaining and makes you think,"This well-paced story incorporates science, philosophy, and a dash of religion to really make you think about the fragility of society and our rightful role in the natural world. Several people who have also read the story have commented that at the end, they literally said, ""Holy sh*t!"" It's tough to put down!"
1,not a dvd,"vhs, not dvd in kit. returned first one and they sent another with vhs. first amazon purchase, never again, they rot."
4,The Roth IRA,This book provides good information for those who want to underrstand about Roth's. Highly recommended.
5,More Great Wagner By Szell,"I am not a huge fan of opera, but I loved George Szell's ""Wagner: Orchestral Excerpts"" disc on Sony Essential Classics so much, that I bought this companion title of Wagner Orchestral Music. While this disc is not fully dedicated to Wagner recordings by the great Szell and Cleveland combination, it is every bit as delightful as the ""Excerpts"" title. (Eugene Ormandy conducts the Philadelphia Orchestra on the first two tracks, and the fourth track ""Prelude to Act III"" from ""Lohengrin"" as well). Simply put, I have enjoyed these two discs so much that I am ready to go see (gasp) a Wagner opera. Or at least watch one on Great Performances."
1,HORRIBLE CHOICE!!,"THIS BOOK IS TERRIBLE TO READ. YET IT MAY HAVE VITAL INFO REGARDING SPACE, I WOULD RATHER EAT A BOX OF NAILS THAN TO TRY TO READ THIS BOOK AGAIN.The text is too small and it's literally a struggle to try and sit to read the information. I couldn't get past chapter 2 until I finally gave up on the book.Good luck if you are required to purchase this book.SAM"
5,Made In France.,"L'Essentiel Mireille Mathieu isn't exactly your average 'Greatest Hits' collection. It covers some big hits like ""Une Femme Amoureuse"" (Woman In Love) & some early 60's chansons like ""Mon Credo"" and the very Parisien ""Paris En Colere"", but the album has many surprises for her die hard fans out there.Many previously unreleased on CD tracks, like the long forgotten, 'Corsica', 'Ma Vie M'appartient', 'La Demoiselle D'Orleans', 'Made In France' & 'Des Soleils Bleu Blanc'. All tracks beautifully remastered and never sounded better."
3,Interesting but scattered,As a prospective gay father I am hungry for any information about gay families I can find. This book offered some useful personal example but the information is very scattered and quite focused on the lesbian perspective and experiences.
1,Mp5a4 poorly made,We bought this Mp5a4 Style Airsoft Electric Rifle about a month ago and it broke within a few days. I'm disappointed in the way this rifle was made considering it was very exprensive and brand new when we bought it. Please consider using better parts or mechanism to make it last longer than a few days.
1,A Misfire,"This item suffers from two main problems. First, the quality of the product is questionable. Shortly after my son bought it it got stuck on automatic fire and would not come out of it. Second, after I and my son indicated to Deal N Steal that we were completely dissatisfied with the product, we have to this date received short, unhelpful responses that do not even begin to satisfy us as to resolving this purchase. At this time I would not under any circumstances recommend this product or the seller we used."
4,Valuable resource,"A valuable resource, particularly when used in conjunction with the Princeton Review and Yale books. Evaluative material like this always requires healthy skepticism - that goes double for anonymous book critiques!"
4,Fiske Guide Useful for College Hunting,"While the Fiske Guide may be biased on some regards it is overall an excellent resource for students looking into colleg. It represents the top schools in the country and presents very viable information. Furthermore, I was admitted and visited Duke, Stanford, UPenn, Tufts, Georgetown, Yale, Brown. Each essay accurately reflected the feel or aura of the school."
1,Much WORSE than useless!,"I serve on college accreditation teams. We visit colleges and talk with students and faculty, often at random. We review curriculum, finances, etc. There is, even at most name-brand colleges, plenty of bad along with the good. If however, you read the Fiske Guide to Colleges, 99% of the evaluative statements about 99% of the colleges are positive. It is terribly misleading. The author should be ashamed of himself."
1,Propaganda for the colleges.,"Each college's review is based on a handful of questionnaires completed by students who are HAND-PICKED by the administration--usually their student assistants and/or other students known to love the school--e.g., the tour guides. This is incredibly biased. Also, the cover of the book touts it as ""The best""--grossly misleading--it was cited as best by the BOOKSELLERS Association--judging it on its sales not its quality."
1,Not Good,We had a list of eight popular colleges we wanted to research and only one was listed in this book. We found the book to be VERY limited and nearly useless.
2,Does not give any flavor,"When I was in high school, I thought this book was the Bible. It isn't. Since I have been in college I have found that the book attempts to give a taste of the flavor of the colleges, and it fails miserably. With respect to colleges in Texas, at least, it captures neither the true strengths of the colleges nor the the real weaknesses. Take a tour of four colleges that you might like to attend during the summer or Christmas of your senior year. Summer is best, since class will be in session, but you HAVE to visit to have any idea what the school is like. Asking older friends what the strengths and weaknesses of their colleges are will also be more productive. Find another book that evaluates colleges based on the academic strengths of the college within the field you wish to pursue, if you must buy a book and if such a book exists. In short, don't waste your money on this one."
1,Phony!!!,More phony college propaganda and advertising! The trick is to pick which college's admissions office actually wrote the text
4,take the road less travelled.....,"when i first started writing poetry,amiri baraka and robert frost were the first poets i discovered. baraka, i admired for his political activism. frost, for taking the beauty of new england and everyday life and putting it on paper...when i lived in maine, i really began to read his stuff closely and saw some of the places in new england he talked about. when i was in college, one of my college counselors actually carried a copy of ""the road less travelled,"" in his wallet, a poem i have adored as well...every poet should know at least one frost poem.."
5,Great Book Series,"I bought this book series to help educate my daughter about Native American culture. The stories are emotionally compelling and believable, and they not only teach about Native American culture, customs, and language in amazing detail, they also instill a strong sense of moral integrity in the reader. The American Girl book series are great, fun, engaging ways to teach American History."
5,Great Books,"American Girls are a great way to bring children to history, and give them a great overview of life from a child's perspective."
3,hmmm...,the book has alot of indian religious things cluttering it's pages. it was written on a very easy level compared to some of the other books. I was very dissapointed in the series. good morals were portrayed.
3,Khoiba - Nice Traps,"Mole Listening Pearls has always had a keen ear for downtempo, and NICE TRAPS, from Czech group Khoiba (licensed to the U.S. through StreetBeat), continues to show their talent at picking new sounds. Khoiba, in particular, shows a good bit of rock influence here, immediately evident from the electric guitars that come in on ""Pure Hands."" There are also some hints of glitch, as well, from the raspy drums and squelching feedback of ""No Feedback."" But these are all subservient to the mellow rhythms and Ema Brabcova's fragile vocals. They shine with pain on ""Terribly,"" but it's not a powerhouse performance by any stretch of the imagination. Instead, it seems to work much better on the icier compositions, like ""T.I.M.E."" But a few compositions sound too similar, like ""Make No Silence"" and ""Sonic Parts,"" which flattens the album as a whole. But tracks like the dense ""Pathetic"" help relieve this feeling."
2,not reliable,so far i cant get enough volts off my solor panels to get it to kick off and on. I am going to try some bigger panels and if that doesnt work i will send it back. The company i bought it from ripped me off and charged me 3 times as another site. THey would not give a refund and just told me to send it back. Not very helpfull to say the least.
1,Contains Incorrect Information,"I've enjoyed Robert Irwin's books on home buying. He's a real estate agent and has good info to offer on that topic. However, in this book he delves into mortgages. And as most real estate agents do when discussing an industry in which they have not worked, he makes mistakes.This book contains incorrect information about loans. For example, there is incorrect/inaccurate information about locking the interest rate right in the beginning.If you want a GOOD book on mortgages written by an industry insider, getMortgage Ripoffs and Money Savers: An Industry Insider Explains How to Save Thousands on Your Mortgage or Re-Fi. Take a look at the reader feedback; it speaks for itself."
4,good author,I found Irwin's Tips & Traps When Buying a Home useful when I bought my first house. I expect this to be useful also.
3,Leaves cracks on my lips,"Now, I had purchased and used this several times in different shades, but I always resulted in the same outcome. I'm a huge fan of Revlon makeup, but this is something I won't ever use again.I don't know if it's because I bite my lips a lot, but the colored part of the lip color would eventually bleed into the cracks of my lips and it was difficult to remove off. And then there were instances, while I was at work, the lipstick would eventually begin to wear off after so many hours, and an outer ring (almost like lip liner) would remain behind.I live in California, a hot sunny state, so my lips are very dry. So I tried adding a balm or chapstick (moisturizer), but then the color wouldn't go on at all!I don't recommend it because of my bad experience, but maybe it will work better for you."
4,V,"I have all 5 'V' collector videos and they're in good condition, videos play well. The mini series was good for it's time, it has that 80's charm however being a fan myself I like the NEW 'V' SERIES better."
4,"great for the price, not quite straight.","i really like the style of this coat rack, but it does not stand completely straight. you can mess with it to get it a little better, and with coats on it you can't tell, but overall i really like it and would buy it again."
3,Coat Rack,This rack comes in three main sections to make it stand. The top piece didn't tighten down completely to the middle peice. And the bottom piece wasn't threaded right to be able to screw and tighten to finish putting the rack together. So the rack rocks back and forth at this particular joint. My husband is going to JB weld it together. I will never be able to take it apart again but atleast it will now be functionable. In my opinion the rack itself is a good price and it is a very nice looking piece. I thought about returning it but in my opinion it would be more hassel than what it is worth. I paid a hefty shipping price and I will leave it at that.
5,great deal,I was very happy with it. The price was great. I put it together in 10 minutes and it looks terrifice.
3,Nice looking but broke quickly,"I really liked this coat rack and gave it as a Christmas present. During a party at this person's house, when a sixth coat was added to the rack, a leg broke off and was irreparable."
4,Needs more hardware,"Love it but it needs more screw for the bottom, one of the legs fell out from under it when someone put their coat on it and the whole thing came crashing down."
4,Great purchase,"The price is pretty amazing. I looked forever for something I could use in my bedroom for additional hanging (drying bras, hooded sweatshirts, etc.) I had no problems putting it together (the main center piece was threaded just fine) and it took less than 20 minutes to put it all together. Great piece- sturdy, easy to put together, stylish, unique, solid."
3,House address solar unit,"The unit arrived in a timely manner and works well. Been out in the wx for about a month and is working as advertised. Not the finest workmanship in the world,but about what you would expect. Does the job."
3,worked fine until water got in and killed it,"I was very happy with the light until it stopped working. It appears that water got into the solar panel on top, perhaps during the winter when snow landed on it, melted slightly, froze, and probably cracked something open even more than it was to begin with."
4,good for amateur,light and convient to carry. just suit my lowepro camera bag. every time i go out to take photo i won't forget it
2,"Just one, not four brushes","The bristles feel a bit too sharp/scratchy for my taste. Other than that, it is what it is.Just beware that it's a single $1.29 item - not a set of four. It will cost you over $10.00 shipped, and the shipping charge is separate from that of other items on your Amazon order."
1,Buyer beware - misleading advertising,"Their graphic representation of the product is quite misleading... creating the illusion that the purchaser is receiving (1) set of four brushes for the purchase price of $4.50 (including S&H; charges).These same brushes can be purchased in any reputable barber shop for $1 per item. However, the total cost for a SINGLE brush from this seller will result in a whopping $4.50!Disgraceful advertising method... buyer beware!!"
5,Amazing!,Unsurpassed quality and amazing performance. A lifetime knife you'll be so pleased you purchased this one!!!
4,Looking Back,"I really enjoyed this book. It was originally recommended to my by my mentor as a look back to the roots of my coven.This is a great resource to any budding Wiccan out there, who'd like to take a closer look at some of the history surrounding our faith."
4,a good book on the alexandrian trad,"this book covers alot of ground on the alexandrian tradition and alex and maxine sanders' coven. it talks about healing,magick,astral projection, and much more."
4,Beyound Stared Straight for my granddaughter,"This DVD, BEYOUND SCARED STRAIGHT, was purchased for my granddaughter. She loves the shows and have watched them all. Now that she has the DVD she and her friends watches Season 1 over and over."
2,Don't blame the Cleveland Orchestra!,"I just heard the Janacek played by Szell and Cleveland on the radio for the first time.This is a prime example of a conductor getting in the way of a fine orchestra.Szell's tempo's are VERY slow. It forces the musicians (esp. the brass) to playwith a heavy unbalanced sound. The sound engineers are far to active in this performance. At times the full brass sound far away, and then the oboist sounds like he's sitting next to you! I love this music, and in some styles Szell is great, but his slavic blood isn't boiling here. Check out the other recordings recommended, but for me the best is still the fleet footed version by Ozawa and the Chicago Symphony recorded in the 1970's."
3,Lackluster,"If you're expecting a typically high-voltage, sharply played account at tempos on the fast side, don't buy this album. The Sinfonietta is a disappointment - Szell's tempos are sluggish, the playing is adequate at best and excitement is never stirred up quite as well as in other recordings (Mackerras/VPO, Bakala). The other items are similarly served in more colorful performances. The disc isn't bad by any means, just adequate."
3,A-OK product,This product works fairly well and avoids putting holes in the walls. Good price through Amazon.
5,If I were stuck out in space and could have one Cuban music CD in my possession,"Pa' Que Se Entere La Habana would be it. OK, one CD of modern Cuban music that's not Los Van Van, because I'd want one of them too. This is what came (later) to be called ""Timba"" at its absolute best and most frenetic. It is also probably the best musical social chronicle, along with Frank Delgado's work from the 90s, of what was happening in Cuba during the Special Period. Great to see that it is once again available, along with with Tremendo Delirio, which were both unavailable following a radio payola scam."
5,The Definitive Clarinet Concerto Performance,"Robert Marcellus had the true ""American"" sound - a synthesis of qualities from both the French and German schools. His rendition of the Mozart Concerto has been hailed in most journals as one of the most definitive of all performances. Using a Buffet R-13 clarinet (serviced by Moennig) and a Kaspar mouthpiece, his sound is what most clarinetists dream to have. His reading is straight ahead, no fancy ornamentation - just the way Mozart would have enjoyed hearing it...A true clarinet legend."
5,The flute concertos are great too,"I will have to echo the sentiments of the other reviewers on this page -- Marcellus put in a wonderful performance of Mozart's Clarinet Concerto. His tempos are almost perfect (he slows down in a couple of unusual places), and his tone is easily one of the best I've heard. While the whole thing has a small hiss throughout, the recording is from 1961, and it's not much of a bother.Also on this CD are both of Mozart's Flute Concertos. While not quite as good, they are still very nice works, with the final movement of the second being a favorite of mine. Eugenia Zuckerman's performance is one of the best I've heard -- to echo my statements on Marcellus, her tempos and tone are very lovely. No hiss on theese either.While this disc is often recommended for the Clarinet Concerto, this disk would still be worthwhile without it. And at the price it's at, it's hard to pass up."
3,not as white as it appears,"The tape worked fine, but it was sold as white when it's clearly not. It is more of a yellowish off-white."
2,"If you life Gospel, keep looking","The tracks just rehashed gospel and don't combine to anything I can remember listening after a couple of mins, I would not recommend this CD"
1,not worth the paper printed on,I understand that everyone carries their biases with them. Naturally Eritreans tend to support the liberation movement for Eritrean independence while Ethiopian scholars tend not to. This can also apply to positions on the last war. European or American scholars can tend to bend toward either position or camp too. This is also understandable. In both situations most authors that approach the subject attempt to present an objective and logical argument. Paul Henze abandons all signs of professional journalism or scholastic research. He presents a book that covers the war with an absolute Ethiopian bias. You will find here a presentation that even pro-Ethiopian scholars would cringe at. This book is JUNK!!!!!! and is better off in a personal blog somewhere.
4,Carpathian mountans,"Although I am not Jewish, It was an insite into the Carpathian mountain area. My Grandparents came from there."
2,Ladies and Gentlemen - LENNY BRUCE!!!,"I once took this book to be the final word on the life of Lenny Bruce. Subsequent years have proven that the late Albert Goldman's research methods and conclusions leave much to be desired. His 1988 biography of John Lennon was written with a mean-spirited bias that is difficult to comprehend. It was also littered with errors of fact.As far as I'm concerned, a precise, comprehensive biography of Lenny Bruce has yet to be written.Tom Degan"
3,Dissatisfied,"If I knew that this was digitally printed, I would have never ordered it....it is hard to read and there are pages where you can't read anything because it is not legible.In the future I will check first to see if the book is digitally printed....then I WON'T ORDER IT..."
2,Item received was damaged or used,"I ordered this umbrella directly from Adorama along with a couple of pocket wizards, bogen lightstand and a light meter. The umbrella had the Adorama logo on it ... not a big deal. What was a big deal is that the umbrella appeared to be used. The rod, end of the umbrella is damaged like someone had clamped on it to tightly already and the umbrella's rod appears to have been shortened. I've emailed Adorama and have yet to hear back."
5,Nice for the price!,"It's built very nicely, sturdy and folds up in a easy to carry package. Great deal for the money spent!"
4,"Effective, compact and portable",The umbrella works as it should and gives great results. Be careful with the collapsing portion as it is a little flimsy. With careful use it should last me quite a while.
2,Junk.,"Works great, but broke after only two weddings. Opened it up and one of the metal rods snapped. 10 bucks per wedding seems expensive. AVOID."
3,Not 43 inches... more like 36.,"Ordered this umbrella for the large size via Adorama, but though the packaging says 43"", measured across the diameter of the umbrella opened, it is 36"" rib tip to rib tip, 34"" side to side, which is quite a bit smaller than what I expected. Do they measure across the arch of the umbrella?"
1,NeverCame!,I ordered this book for this new semester I am in at Georgia tech and it still hasn't come in so I had to go to our bookstore and buy the book for a second time so I could begin my studying. It's unacceptable to promise something and not follow through especially if I have to pay for it and I'm a poor college kid. Don't buy from this.
3,The authors of this book have made two big mistakes,"1. The Colombian writer and Nobel Prize Gabriel García Márquez is repeatedly called along the book as Márquez. His family name as the authors should know is García Márquez.2. In the same way the authors use Columbia, or Columbian when speaking of Colombia."
1,If you like to waste time and money,"This is one of..no wait, the worste 80's b movie I've ever seen, and I've seen alot. From the cover of the movie you may get some crazy ideas, but don't let the cover fool you. There is one good lockerroom seen, but it only last for a couple of seconds, and the other 89 minutes or so of the movie has a bad plot, screen writing and acting."
1,S 50 Headaches,I've owned the S 50 for just 1 month and it has to be sent in for warranty work already.Seems the memory is shot according to one of Sirius crackpot tech team. Told it might have taken a powersurge by not turning off the S 50 before turning the car off.I find that extremely hard to believe and a major inconvenience if thats the case. I also bought the home kit which was quite over priced as well.THe main reason I purchased the unit was it's tivo like abilities which cant even be preset so if you want to tape Stern you have to sit there and record every 2 hours.Quality wise I find it not as good as standard fm radio and no where near DVD quality..Thumbs down.. Unfortunately it's the only way to catch Stern..Save your money and buy the cheapest model..
2,s50 - worst product ever,"The S50 is by far the worst product I've ever dealt with. It has a lot of potential but unfortunately it just doesn't work. I've already exchanged the product once because it wasn't working properly and now I am having even more problems with the functionality. I also have to say that it is not user-friendly at all. I've spent hours and hours sitting on hold trying to get through to Sirius and wrote them an e-mail with 11 issues I have with the product that I shouldn't have if I'm spending $300 on a radio. Needless to say, their response to my e-mail was short and sweet saying that would e-mail my complaints to the product support department. Thanks a lot Sirius."
1,You WILL regret buying this,"This thing is so buggy it has its own forum devoted to it and its problems on the major sirius website. I'm no XM fanboy (I subscribe to both XM and Sirius), but this thing, especially for the asking price, is ridiculous. $350 for limited recording, no home dock, no equalizer, TONS of bugs, etc. If Stern wasn't on Sirius, they would sell 5 of these throughout the country. Even the 14-month-old MyFi accepts a satellite signal, and the next generation (look up Pioneer inno)--and includes a home dock. I'm trying hard to think of something good about this product because I was so looking forward to it, but I just can't.That's fine if you like this, but to rate it 5 stars, you HAVE to be a Sirius shill, it's just too buggy to use, even if you're fully aware of its advertised limitations."
2,Anyone else have this problem?,"First I think it's crap that this thing is suppose to hold 50 hours of recorded shows but not continuous hours like, say, a 4 or 5 hour show (like some of the shows on Sirius are).Anyway, my reciever will work fine for days and then one day I'll come home, turn it on and... nothing. It's like it's been wiped clean. No background graphic for the channels, no station names and best of all no sound at all. I got online and updated the software and (eventually) it worked again. Sometimes I can just take out the battery to reset it and that'll work, too. This adorable little quirk has happened enough times now that I could just as easily smash the S50 with a sledgehammer and not waste anymore time with it.But if and when it does work it sounds good."
1,"Faulty design, faulty manufacture, faulty service","Please do not buy this product it will fail as mine has making it an expensive mp3 player. Sirius tech support will finally tell you you are tol, buy a new radio.If you are a life time subscription holder you will be out the $75.00 transfer fee, new radio, new docking stations. Sirius has no interest in waiving the transfer fee or offering a discount on a comparable radio.Sirius is only out to make a huge buck off you, somebody has to pay Howard.Have an xm player thats been through it and still works fine.I'm now a firm believer in the saying ""Sirius Sucks"""
2,"Neat unit, but with problems.","I bought an S50 in May 2006. I worked fine for about a month, then would not pick up the signal at all, then it wouldn't even come on or boot up. I have to say that Sirius was good about sending me a brand new unit (with the agreement that I would send the bad one back within 30 days) within a week of calling. However, the new unit hardly works at all. It turns on fine and does pick up the digital signal, but the sound quality is horrible. Tons of static. I have tried about 10 different station settings (which the Sirus customer service gave me the stations that work best for my area) and only 1 station works slightly. I will get an FM adapter (Sirius is currently, of course, sold out right now) and see if that works. If it doesn't, I will throw the S50 away and get a Sportster, which by the way, I have had in my other vehicle for a year with not one problem at all. My advice to buyers is to avoid the S50, but consider the Sportster if you want digital radio."
1,DISAPPOINTING PRODUCT !!!!,"This is a product that is very disappointing!!! Where do I start??FIRST, Recordings are limited to a maximum of 1 hour each. Second, Only shows (yes, that's right only shows - not music) can be saved with a scheduled recording.THIRD, You can record individual songs - not schedule a recording - after the song ends, the recording stops.FOURTH, Scheduled shows are limited to a maximum of 20 with a maximum of 2 hours per each recorded session.FIFTH, If you attempt to schedule more than 20 recordings, you will be prompted to delete an existing scheduled recording or to discard the new recording schedule.SIXTH, poor battery life. If I could I would have given zero stars. I couldn't as one is the minimum. This is an over priced mp3 player. If you are someone who doesn't yet know much about satellite radio: XM is better than sirius: Absolutely True!"
1,Customer service needs a major overhaul-,"Yes, another poster lamenting the all too familiar customer service woes. Suffice to say I've switched to XM and dumped any holdings.I'll regard the bard: ""Brevity is the soul of wit"".~AX"
3,COULD BE BETTER,1ST..u must disconnect in order to download the mp3 of your show. you can't listen to live broadcasts on your computer you must wait til after then you can listen on your computer after you disconnect the base to the ipody type thing. u must buy a dc cord for at home. only thing suppiled is for your car..could be a much better product
2,A fatal car accident is in my future,"This unit was a Christmas gift. I have three main comments.1) Core programming: Excellent - 150 stations, commercial free. Needs more international music (African, Carribean, etc). Grade: A-2) User Interface: Very confusing and counter intuitive menuing system. Grade: C-3) The unit itself: Drives me nuts. Sometime it turns on immediately, more often, the unit powers up but it can't find a signal and sits silent. Only extensive fiddling - unplug the power, plug it back in; turn the unit on and off; remove the unit from the dock and remount; and then finally, for no apparent reason, it powers up finds the signal. I swear I will have a car accident trying to fiddle with this thing while driving. Grade: D-"
1,Hardware is crap,I loved this radio until about 86 days into it. The hardware stopped working. It would freeze up during the boot process. Fortunetely it broke within the 90 day waranty. They sent me a new one within 2 weeks. 90 days later I got THE EXACT SAME FAILURE!! Their hardware is crap!!!
1,Don't waste your money buy a starmate,"I have had this product since November 2005 and it has been nothing but a disappointment.1. Car dock had to be replaced after 3 days2. Various lockups even with the so called new firmware3. Flash drive corrupt4. Home dock at warranty service for over 3 months. Still waiting for replacement.Finally, so tired of dealing with Sirius lack luster customer support ended up taking it back and buying a starmate replay. Siruis should be ashamed charging 300+ dollors for a poorly tested product"
5,serious about sirius,the unit i bought from amazon was a replacement for a unit i bought from another company. at the time of the purchase from amazon i was told that a replacement wouldn't be available for another 4 weeks (from the other company). that's when i went to amazon and the unit was here within a week. it works very well and i am very satisfied with my purchase.
1,Many issues,"First, why can't I listen to LIVE programming while walking around, at a game or at the coffee shop? XM has had it for years in portable units. Second, it stops recording show that are longer than 1 hour. If your show is longer than an hour chances are you'll miss parts of it. Third, this thing gets really hot, I had to take it away from my skin as I was afraid I was going to get burned, It did not get to that point but it scared me.Listening to my S50 right now of a Fox News Recording, NEWS FLASH: THE USA HAS CAPTURED SADAM HUSSEIN! oh wait... its not live, that was months ago! very disappointing. I'm going to get an XM Nexus and have a real portable satellite radio / MP3 player."
1,No Built in tuner like the XM myfi.,"Bought the product on christmas.To my surprise and disappointment, the S50 does not have a built in tuner like the the XM MYFI portable. The home kit is not available until late january so after 2 days I had to ask myself why spend about 3 bills for it, when it's basically no different than having the starmate w/color & cute graphics for each station.It does save mp3s but there is way too much button pressing to get to your playlist or songs. It works but not impressed with it's portability which is how they are advertising this product. I've returned it and will try the MyFi from XM."
1,Junk,"Well I tried to like this, especially as mine was working well, then I finally started having major problems with it and I have to return it for a warranty return so I will not have it for 2-4 weeks.They also do not tell you that you need a PC to keep it in working order (Mac user here)I would not buy this again and do not recommend it."
5,I got the MyFI...but now its MyFi Bye Bye,"I got both of these units...everything in the other reviews is accurate...but the sirius wins:The myfi scheduled recordings mean nothing since my stations like XMU and XM Cafe don't change content much in any given two week period. Th s50 wins here cause you can screen and keep tunes were the XM unit rewrites over memory. I only like 1 out ten songs I here on any station, so you need the ability to collect the 10th song you like. Also, the s50 starts recording as it picks up a station...no need to program a schedule. If you want 8 hrs of the Chill station, turn it on before you go to bed and that what you get. It like tivo in this sense, when the thing is on it going directly to memory. Remember this is Tivo for sat. radio. Ask a tivo user the last time they watch anything live other the sports and special events....doing live content is so 90s...."
1,sirius customer service is the worst,"if you have a problem with sirius you are out of luck.bought radio and boombox nothing but problems...wanted to cancel another order i placed as a gift.beware they will not cancel orders, even if they have not been shipped...problem with my new unit ,they will not help... and can be very rude.this was not my first purchace from sirius, and while their radio content is excellent... customer service is the deal breaker... they suckcall them with questions before you buy... you'll get something else"
3,Too Pricey for the Problems,"The first one wouldn't hold a charge. After that was returned, the second didn't ""wake up"" and record my show (Howard, of course) like the booklet said it would. It didn't come with a home kit--purchased an adaptor so that it could be used at home--another $40. Sometimes it would come a bit loose and lose the signal. In short, you're better off buying the Kenwood Here2everywhere units. They are less expensive and come with car and home docking kits."
1,Being an early adopter stinks!,"I bought this primarily for the Tivo-like recording feature and that's a huge disappointment. If you want to record a full Howard Stern show, forget it. It's not designed to record that many hours and it rarely records the full amount it's supposed to. Show are almost always incomplete - or the device frequently crashes! I've had to remove the battery multiple times because it was frozen.If you're a Mac user, there's no software interface fo the MP3 functions.The sound quality is pretty mediocre, even with full signal strength.Given the cost (don't forget to add $100 to be able to use it at home) and the mediocre performance, don't buy this."
2,Sirius Problems,"Purchased this on December 4, activated on December 11, broken by December 28.Nice looking unit, neat idea the few times it actually works.There is an entire forum devoted to problems with the S50 at Siruis Backstage. Make sure to read it before you puchase this. The number of problems listed is astounding.I'm fairly comfortable with most tech devices, but there is no way to figure out all the quirks on this.Good luck with getting help on their service lines. People are polite, but little knowledge of the many bugs with this system. Most advice re fixing was incorrect.It amazes me that something like this was released. Compare to the iPOD...difference is astounding.Ultimately returned mine after Sirius refused to replace. Would only send a refubished unit. What a waste. They should be ashamed."
1,Horrible! Do Not Buy This!,"Got one for Christmas '05 and it's been nothing but trouble. Have to pop out the battery every two weeks or so to get it going, and 4 times have had to connect to computer and re-install software (with customer support on the phone because it's so counter-intuitive and complicated to use) at which point all saved songs and programs are lost, because there is no easy way to upload programming onto computer for saving a back-up."
1,Horrible Customer Service,"Got My S50 for christmas 2005, it went down in July and after 2-3 weeks of reboots I was told a replacement would be sent in 4 weeks. I have called every month since then and given the same line ""I'm sorry but the replacements are not in yet we expect them any day"". BSBSBS.I called again tonite as was told they just came in 5 days ago. Why wasn't I emailed?? Why do I have do take care of this? WHy do I have to call customer care to credit my acct for 4months down??DO NOT BUY THIS POS. Go XM."
4,"Great styling, many functions, needs some improvement","This unit is designed fairly decent. It get's a 10 for style and a 7.5 for it's functions. The portability of the device is great. You can record up to 50 hours of music but it must be connected to a dock to receive a signal, which is the devices major flaw. The unit can also be used as an MP3 player in which you can download songs from your computer. Good sound clarity and a nice color screen. In all it's a great unit but I hope sirius develops an addition for it becomes totally portable and able to record anywhere."
2,Do yourself a favor,"and don't get involved with the Sirius S-50. It's a really good concept... but badly implemented. If you get one, you will be hooked and spend countless hours on the phone with customer service and surfing the internet trying to find solutions to the ultimate problem...a bad product with bad software. Maybe over time they will have the bugs worked out..or maybe they will go bankrupt..but my advice is to wait."
3,Great Product,Reception is great and it is so nice to not have to sit on the computer and download all of your songs to have a portable MP3 player.
1,"The S50 is Junk, and Sirius Customer Service Sucks!!!!","My S50 has been dead for over three months. I can't get through to customer service, which would be useless anyway, as they have been telling me ""you will be getting a replacement in two weeks"" for three months. Over $400 worth of radio and docking stations which do not work. Angry does not begin to describe!"
2,"great Idea, Horrible Execution","One has to wonder if this was tested prior to shipping. Though the device is slick in its presentation, the proprietory SW that is required for MP3 usage is the buggiest, most unusable software I have used in years. There is freeware/shareware written better than this. Extremely difficult to re-capture memory space after files deletion (try to explain that one!), file names get munged to some encrypted format (e.g., 12akjSU73-XSE) and the 512MB limitation for MP3 is virtually unbearable - you will find yourself forever deleting and replacing music, unless of course you want to listen to the same sounds over and over again. I beg you to wait until rev 2. I am on my way back to Circuit City to get my $329.00 back - less the gas it costs me to go. Very, very dissapointing!!"
1,rip off,"My wife bought me one for Christmas, and I'll be returning it. I don't drive, so I would only be using it to record things at home and then listen to them later on the portable unit. Guess what, I'm screwed. It doesn't come with a home kit...and you can't even buy one anywhere because they're sold out. People on ebay are selling them for $200! Plus, the battery only lasts SIX hours. That means that if you listen to a whole Howard Stern show, you'll need to change it almost every day! Also, close friends report that the sound quality is mediocre at best. At $300+ this thing is basically a big rip-off. I only wanted it for Howard but bye-bye Howard for the time being. Wait six months and I'll bet the price will drop by half."
3,"A little disappointed, but I don't really get it yet...","I got mine for Christmas and had it installed in my car (will buy a home dock when they come out). I haven't really had much time to play with it - hence the 3 stars. I wanted it for Stern and because it records. The S50 isn't as portable or versatile as I hoped. It is a bummer that it won't record from the car unless the car is running. That means, if I want to record, I will have to leave the unit in the home dock and I'll not be able to use it in the car. It's expensive - the unit itself, plus installation at Circuit City, plus the one-year subscription, plus the home dock. I really hope it doesn't end up being irrelevant in 6 months."
1,stopped working after one week,"I experienced problems the first week of the purchase. I had bad signals then it stopped working. I called sirius numerous times and they failed to recognize the problem. They simply did not have enough knowledge of this model. Several times the customer rep tries to resolve the situation by ""sending me a signal and that should work."" One rep mentioned that they have been receiving increased calls concerning product. I returned the S50 and got the sportster for about $140, which is about $200 less!It works great. The S50 looks great but doesn't work. And will cost you a lot of money. Don't buy."
2,It's just an average CAT5 network cable!,"Nothing fancy about this cable, any old straight-thru network cable will do the same thing. Not a horrible price, either, for this long of a cable.Just FYI."
5,work,they help me remove scum buildup easily. I don't really care about exfoliation. I'm a dude who gets grimey quickly and these help to reach my back and scrub real good.
5,Wonderful CD,"This is a truly amazing CD. Kids love it, parents love it. Interesting both lyrically and musically-- try saying that about most kids' music."
1,booooo,"well, apparently skerik took off or got the boot, and with him went all the fun, innovative jazz explorations. in its stead is a bunch of country rock flavored fluff; fine, if that's what you're in the market for, but it's worlds apart from the directions explored in the past, and highly disappointing to fans of their previous music.the liner notes relate that the album is about a journey of sorts through hell. i just wish they hadn't made it quite so literal for this listener. a complete waste of time and money."
5,This guy is great,I like how he send me an email to tell me it was on it's way. And if anything was wrong he would help me out
4,Cars Of The Sizzling 60's: A Decade Of Great Rides And Good Vibrations,"Im a classic car lover, and this book had awesome information on how models came to life, matured, and even died in the 60's."
5,Exactly As Advertised,"The ""Cars of the Sizzling 60s"" book I ordered was delivered on time and in exactly the advertised condition."
5,Yo Gabba Gabba is a win for everyone,"This is a DVD that could easily become the most watched DVD in my house and I am totally fine with that. We love Yo Gabba Gabba in a super huge big way. My kids love the music and the dancing and the singing and the cartoons and the craziness. I love the people they get on the show-- and the ridiculous things they have them do. It's hilarious and awesome because you get the impression they're having a blast doing it too. It's completely silly but it manages to get across some great little tidbits of life lessons too. We watched this one (again) yesterday and my kids were singing ""Don't stop, never give up"" all night long. I liked they were repeating that gem of a message to themselves. It doesn't look, or sound, like anything else on television but in the very best of ways. Wholesome. Fun. Colorful. It's just awesome all around. I hope they keep the magic going in a really big way. Yooooooooooooooo Gabba Gabba!"
4,"""Brand New""","Despite the 70's arrangements on some songs, I like this CD. Peg, as always, sounds hip, and her version of ""You Make Me Feel Brand New"" is sweet and moving.The bonus tracks are quite good, especially ""Let's Keep Dancing,"" a semi- ""Is That All There Is"" type song.""I Wanna Be Seduced"" is outrageously funny, and the album all told has a gospel,a tender, and a carnival atmosphere. I find it a fun sound trip."
1,Be careful when buying electrical items,"I ordered this MAF sensor and received it in a timely manner,as I paid for overnight delivery. I installed it properly as I have been a mechanic for 35 years. I cleared the DTC and drove the vehicle immediately after installation and all was well. I have only driven this vehicle about 5 times since the installation.When starting the vehicle this morning and attempting to drive it it was having the same trouble as before I installed the rebuilt MAF sensor and I connected my code reader and had the same code as before.I believe this item is defective."
1,Sent wrong product - They sent fiber reinforced packing tape,"I think that I have the same problem as the first poster. I wanted the clear version of the ""blue"" painters tape. What I got was clear fiberglass reinforced packing tape.I will try to get this corrected"
5,Buy this,"For how cheap this book is, even new, on Amazon, you'd be missing a lot of great information on film scoring. It focuses a lot on older film composers, and is a great historical journey through the masters of the past."
3,Music for your movies,"Overall, good reading, however, related to historical figures. Helps get an idea as to where the Film Industry started and where we are today."
1,Not worth the short time it takes to read,"What begins as a promising look at the odd idiosyncratic reasons that people break up with each other (which actually might make an interesting book), this pamphlet quickly devolves into unorganized, often mean-spirited lists of prejudices that leave the reader empty of content.The 48 page book looks hastily thrown together, and while it can be humorous at times, usually fails to make you laugh. This book makes serviceable reading for taxiing to and from an airport terminal during a severe weather delay."
3,My son Hates it,"My son refuses to to take them-he said it makes him want to throw up. I tried it myself, its not that bad at all, it just does takes a little longer to chew the capsules. I give it three stars because the flavor is great."
1,don't be fooled by color cover. absurd product deception.,"although this book is 379 pages, weighs five pounds and has almost 2000 photographs there is not a single color photo between the covers. how could any serious writer or publisher charge almost 100 dollars and not have one nice glossy photo of the 20th century's greatest artwork. i might as well buy the color blind version of the color wheel the next time i paint my house or the out of focus print of Citizen Kane. buyer beware!!bpm.2012."
2,Mundane,"Character study of two down and outers who are brought together by one burgling the others house and the victim responding with pity and compassion. Story drags from one unfortunate situation to another. The big problem with the movie, besides the pace, was I never cared about either character. Neither character was sympathetic."
4,"""Concurrent Sentences""","""Concurrent Sentences,"" billed as a story of ""Murder, Love and Redemption,"" is another of a recent genre of stories detailing the shoddy prosecution of a young, urban African American man, Victor Clark. Though not yet in film or up there in popularity with ""The Hurricane,"" ""Concurrent Sentences'"" real-life theme is also thought-provoking and disturbing when the reader learns, for example, that a prosecution witness picked the accused from a selection of police mug shots of Mr. Clark. The problem? The police had no prior mug shots of Mr. Clark. Such minor points aside, a conviction is handed down. The startling inconsistencies of the trial, as well as the blossoming passion between inmate and author, Denise Beck-Clark are framed in vivid descriptions of their strikingly different childhoods and an uncommonly uplifting conclusion. The components of this story combine harmoniously to make ""Concurrent Sentences"" an easy and worthwhile read."
5,Excellent,The best cologne ever - my husband loves it and the women perfume it's as wonderful as the men !
5,Great smell for men.,Angel cologne for men is by far the best smelling cologne that I've ever had. I would suggest this to any man as it is very attracting to women.
2,Smell vanishes within an hour,This was my husband's favorite cologne for years and they have somehow changed the formula and it lasts about 30 minutes. I bought here on amazon thinking maybe it would be different as the last I bought was at Neiman Marcus. Same holds true for the women's Angel. VERY disappointing.
1,WASTE OF TIME!!!!!!,"A STOCK CANCELLATION EMAIL WITH A FAKE APOLOGY DOES NOT MAKE UP FOR WASTING A WEEK OF MY TIME WAITING FOR A PRODUCT YOU NEVER HAD. THIS WAS TO BE A GIFT! WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS ""SELLER"" THAT THEY CAN'T SUPPLY AN ITEM THEY SOLD? DO NOT ORDER IF YOU WANT TO ACTUALLY BUY SOMETHING."
1,Angel by Amen,"it smells like crap, they must have change the fragrance because it used to be my favorite. The title says it all ""Toilette Spray""!"
2,Low on MoJo,"Joey Negro is a brilliant musician, producer, composer but this is an album not worthy of the energy which is evident in all of INCOGNITO albums. in the words of Austin Powers, The music has no 'MoJo', all of them are half-baked, low energy and pointless pieces of music that has been produced in a period where the band should have been collecting some energy for something brilliant.2 stars because, it can play in your store room (faintly) and wouldnt bother anyone.BTW I have almost all of the INCOGNITO albums."
2,"Way too short, not what I expected","As a total Denmark fiend, I am buying everything I can get on this wonderful country. This video is basically a travel show on tape. It's very choppy and broken into small segments to cover a variety of information including Vikings, Tivoli, Danish foods, etc. To make matters worse, it was only 30 minutes long. I was disappointed in this purchase, but will keep in for my collection."
1,Beware of this dangerous float!!!,"Save your money and your child's life and do not buy this. As soon as we put my 23lb daughter in this it turned her over in the pool on her face. Of course I was right with her to pull her up out of the water but she was terrified of the pool for the rest of the day and refused to get back in the water. Horrible product, BEWARE!"
1,Bigger Balls,Nobody gave a bad or detailed review? Did anybody back test any of these strategies? What were your results? Would you have sat through five down years? Really! Come On!
2,"WARNING! Watches from WATCHZONE.com in Dallas, TX factory Seconds!","Watch looked good, then it did not keep time well at all even stopped. Warning....the watches appear to be factory seconds, returned watch for refund."
4,Is there an error?,"Agree entirely that this is a splendid performance but it has one puzzling flaw. I downloaded the MP3 and the flaw may be with that version and not the recorded one - placing the blame on Amazon, sadly. The most famous piece in the operetta, the Merry Widow Waltz, Lippen Schweigen, is missing the first half. Danilo's beginning is not to be heard. The track begins with Hanna's Bei jedem Walzerschritt. It is difficult to believe that this cut was made by Ackerman. If someone else has the full version, let us know so it can be corrected. Puzzling. That deletion is the only reason to deny this that fifth star."
5,Free Kindle products make me smile,"I got this because it sounded good, and how can you pass up a Kindle freebie. Besides a good book is hard to pass up."
5,Amazing,I loved this book and I think there should be more kids games and I would recommend it to lots and lots of people
3,Not what I was expecting.,"When I downloaded this for my Kindle, I thought it WAS a game. Instead, it is a list of games you can play with friends at parties. I didn't see a publishing date on it but it seems to be from the 1950's or so. The games are of the pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey variety.At the time I downloaded this title, it was in the ""Free Games"" section of the Kindle catalog."
3,Games for kids,"I was disappointed as I thought this would be a book where I could actually interact, do puzzles etc. I did not realize it was an instruction book on many games. I have no doubt many people will find more than enough games they will like as it was expansive."
1,kindle,I deleted this item right away was not happy at all with this. With downloading this item on my kindle goes very easy but again was not happy with it so it was deleted.
2,Not great for everyone,"After downloading I was disappointed in the contents. Some families with children may find this more helpful than I did, but my two granddaughters (12 and 5) were not too enthusiastic either."
3,games for everybody,i think games for everybody is a very very useful book.befor i read it i never realy boutht games at all but now i play games all the time.i still read it sometims because i like to change my mind.
3,Too short,"I bought this for my son for work and he liked everything but it's too short. Doesn't even come to the top of his jeans. Pockets are also placed very high, hard to get hands into. I guess if your around 6' it will be too short."
1,did try to buy the jacket but,did not know that the used third party people like the airlines got bogged down in red tape and they used my roomates credit card without authoraztion and have not recevied my money back for cancalation yet
5,Soany compliments,These earring are great! Comfy and beautiful! I get so many compliments and then when I tell them how little I paid they are hooked. I wear them everyday and they still loOk great .
5,AMAZING!,These are perfect and match my tattoo that I got 4 years ago for my 18th bday! A little small than I thought they would be but I love them!
4,"strange, sexy and exiting!","This is one of the weirdest gay erotic books I have ever read. For those who like S&M it's perfect. Probably one of the most original plots but somewhat reminds me of a movie called ""johns""."
4,neat stuff for my basic social stats course,"I've used eight or ten ideas from this book to good effect. Some of the material is basic, and some is well beyond the scope of the undergraduate social stats course I teach, so the book would likely be useful to a variety of stats courses. The book has a good index that let's you find tips or demonstrations relevant to the concept you are teaching."
3,Disappointed,"From the title and the amount I paid for this book, I expected a lot more bang for my buck. Admittedly, I could have spent more time looking through the book, but in the time I did spend, I never found anything really good to use with my class. Maybe I'll try again next year."
3,"Good product inside, cheap design outside.","The title pretty much says it all. I really like speed and security that comes with the flash drive but the switch-blade function eventually wore loose and fell apart within 4 weeks. Also, the key chain hole at the top of the handle popped out, which I though was a purposeful function and loved the idea of, but instead it was just not able to hold more than a few ounces of weight over the span of a more than a week or so. Solution: keep the drive safe in a pocket or briefcase instead of on a key chain."
4,No cap to lose!!,"It is SO! SO! easy to use one of those tiny USB caps!! And, while the drives that slide out of the case have some advantages -- in an even slightly harsh environment -- too easy to get crud in the connectors.That's where this format USB drive hits the sweet spot!! The end of your drive (connector) is covered and protected when not in use, and you don't have a cap to lose!SWEET!"
4,Good Drive,Nice little drive. The only problem is it doesn't play nice with Windows vista without the CD rom drivers. So if you carry your CD with you it can be used everywhere.about the drive itself 4GB seems a good size to hold 14 hours of music and a lot of smaller files between work and home.
3,"Good compilation of current humor, but not about Wall Street","If you're around jokesters or if you trade jokes over e-mail with friends, you've probably heard or read at least half of the jokes in this book. Still, it is a nice collection of mostly contemporary material. If your conception of the book, based on the title, is that the jokes are about the financial industry in some way, they aren't. In fact, due to the political incorrectness of some material, it's no wonder the authors are anonymous."
5,Hilarious,This is one funny joke book. You don't need to be an investment banker to enjoy this. I would recommend it as a great travel book as it packs easily.
3,not bad,not a bad book bag - it is not USGI but it serves the purpose - seems like it will last for a time
3,GOOD SHOE FOR WORK OR DRESS,"I've worn these shoes for years. They are appropiate for the office and for dress occasions. True to most shoes, they are engineered to wear out after about six months. The soles develop holes and the heals wear down. On the positive side, they look good (simple but dressy - I don't like tassles etc), and they are comfortable. In addition, they can be found in stores for around $60 so I pay about $120/yr plus tax. If you are looking for an attractive somewhat dressy loafer, this is it. Just don't expect them to last."
1,Poor Construction,"This is a fantastic looking shoe. It would definitely be one of my favorites if it did not actually have to go on my feet and serve it's purpose. This is not a particularly comfortable shoe, but it is not uncomfortable either.The main problem with this shoe is that The leather upper is attached to the sole with glue, rather than with stitching. Within a week and a half of using this shoe, the leather upper has already started to detach from the sole. I am not expecting anything beyond the call of duty when I buy a pair of shoes. I just want to be able to wear them around the office without them falling apart. This shoe fell apart quickly. Stay away from these."
1,LeBron James: The Rise of a Star,I am not a true sports fan or a reader of sports history or biography so my review comes with no past experience. I truly enjoyed the book and thought it was well written. It was informative and yet entertaining. Not only did Morgan capture LeBron's past but gave the readers a glimpse into how his character was built and what we could possibly look for in the years to come. Congratulations to Morgan on a well-written book!
5,Captured,"David Lee Morgan, Jr. captured the ups and downs of a young talented athlete growing up in today's world. Living in the same town as LeBron and documenting each step of the way on LeBron's journey to the NBA; David Lee did an extraordinary job of writing this story."
1,the greatest show ever...but way too pricey,This has always been my favorite show for grilling and bbqing. But when I ordered this I bought it without reading the description. And I was surprised when I got it in that it was just one disc. I thought for the price it was for the whole season. I was very disappointed. I had to send it back without even opening it. But I still maintain that this show should still be on tv cause it is the best...!!
2,"Well intended, but stay away","I was catching up on Schubert lieder when I ran across this compilation. The main attraction consists of a recital by lyric soprano Judith Raskin. I remember her fondly from the Sixties, but here the sound is suffocatingly close and boxy, giving her voice a shrill edge that for me was unlistenable. Nor is Raskin's style very admirable, and accompanist George Schick is stiff and dull.As fillers we get the young Kiri Te Kanawa making beautiful sounds in three very familiar songs. The interpretations aren't completely a blank, and fans of Kiri will enjoy her vocalism. The remaining space is taken up with Schubert duets done by Elly Ameling and Peter Pears. Both are expert in Schubert, but Pears is in the ugliest, most curdled voice I've ever heard from him.If these deficits don't put you off, the program is rewarding and the price is right."
4,Everything you always wanted to know about yourself,"This is the book you need if you want to write the story of your life to leave for children and grandchildren; if you are at a crossroads in your life and want to look at where you've been, where you are, and where to go from here, and if you would like to develop autobiography workshops in your community center, adult school or senior center."
5,Review: Performance and Stability of Aircraft,"This book provides a reasonably complete introduction to flight performance and dynamics. These are the two outstanding features of this book - a unified introduction to performance as well as stability issues, and a very complete treatment of both aspects. On the completeness front with regards to flight dynamics, it fares much better than most recognized, dedicated standard books. Design issues related to stability and control have been addressed along with analytical issues, and this book will be useful to students, engineers and designers too."
5,Love,I love every season of 90210. My husband and I are still big fans. We rewatch the seasons often. We started with season 1 a couple months ago and are watching hours of 90210 every night!! This season was great. Such an amazing show.
3,Great top...legs could use some work,"Table top is nice and the pack size it great for the beach, etc. However, the legs could use a little work. They are somewhat difficult to unfold (might have to take some silicone or WD40 to the accordian thing) and I mistook this table for one I saw on a different site that had individually adjustable legs for leveling and height control. I thought I could make it a picnic table or a cocktail table. All in all, a decent buy."
4,good,el producto el bueno pero delicado en poco tiempo de uso se daño levemente pero pude repararlo
3,not what i asked,"I asked for a reflective surf board bag and came in white color. The box is too big, consider it for shipping options overseas"
3,ridicule and satire of colleges,"The idea that Groucho could be put in charge of a college or university in 1932 is pretty funny alone, but these brothers mock everything sacred in education as well as college football.They were a very talented bunch who could play well and sing,besides satire and do slap-stick comedy.I suppose irreverent is the best way to describe this movie."
5,My Favorite Marx Bros. Film!,"Among their 13 films, Marx Brothers play the best in this ""Horse Feathers"". Realizing that this film was made right before ""Duck Soup"", which is considered to be the Brothers' best one, we could think of ""Horse Feathers"" as their second best. What I like the most about this film is 4 different versions of the number, ""Everyone Says I Love You"" performed by 4 Marx Brothers respectively. Being a great fan of Harpo (in fact, my e-mail account is partially made up of the 5 letters of HARPO!), I like Harpo's harp playing so much that I cannot remember how many times I rewinded the tape to listen to it all again! Could you believe that the lengh of this film is under 120 minutes with full of laughing spots?? Well, everyone should check out this 67-year-old entertainng film!!"
4,My rating has nothing to do with the movie itself,"Before I am tarred and feathered, this definitely one of THE best Marx bros. movies!! With rapid-fire snappy one liners from Groucho, and a whirlwind of some of the best physical slapstick from Chico, and Harppo, it is a stand out. BUT, it appears the company who released this has done little to try and restore the sound or picture quality where this movie has apparently not been taken care of. The movie in points looks as if it got caught in a vegi-matic, and put back together by a 5 year old. One scene in particular, where Groucho first goes to Thelma Todd's house, is so choppy and jumpy, I about had a seizure trying to keep up with it. Classic brilliance from the Marx brothers, but be weary of this version. You've been warned."
3,rip off,this is a rip off.. I put up with it on season 3 the volume rip off .. but I'm now just gonna go to netflix.. forget this..
1,Give Dynasty to someone else!,"A different company could have done better with releasing Dynasty in season sets!There HAS TO BE A WAY to get Paramount to licnese Dynasty to to someone else!What we need to do, is start a petition, getting Dynasty released in complete season sets, at a cheaper price!Please have Paramount give Dynasty to someone else!"
5,Best season of the show officially announced...,"The 4rth season is the best season of the show and is finally officially announced and u can find cover art in [...].The last season for pamela sue martin, the first of michael nader as Mr.Farnsworth ""dex"" Dexter, alexi's new lover and future husband.Bad news are this is only the VOL 1 of the season which means we get only the first 14 episodes but it's better than NOTHING and those stupid people who shout for boycot MUST shut their mouth cause if we hear them we won't be able to have our beloved dynasty in dvd. PLAIN and SIMPLE.You want this series on dvd ? BUY THE OFFICIAL DVD'S EVEN IN 2 VOLUMES."
1,What a Ripoff,I'm soooo tired of initially purchasing complete seasons only to have the distributor split the remaining seasons into volumes mid-stream. I will not be purchasing any more series until they come out in a complete boxed set....after they have been out for awhile and discounted!!
1,What a rip off!!,"Dont get me wrong. I love Dynasty but the people who are mass marketing it are making a killing at our expense. I recently pre-purchased Dallas part 11 and all episodes are intact on one dvd set. As was the preious 10 seasons before that. I wanted to relive the Dynasty Saga and found that they are splitting up in season 3 volumn 1 and two. And so on and so on. Why? So they can make more money off me? Its not right so I guess I won't be watching them anymore. I am not cheap, I have collected other series in cluding The Shield, Married with Children, Sopranos and Sex in the City among others and have not felt cheated by spending my money on them. I guess it does not matter.. It is only my opinion... Janice"
2,Another studio rip off,"I think it absolutely ludicrous that there is such a furor over this 20 plus year old series not being released completely. Please, don't take that wrong as I too have JUST gotten into the Dynasty craze. I watched the first 3 seasons for FREE on AOL Video. I feel that eventually the rest of the seasons will show up there too. Certainly, I wish that the studio would release the entire series on DVD as they certainly are making NO money holding the shows in their vaults...and if they wait much longer people are going to say ""Dynasty WHO????"". I think this corporation thinks it is Disney! If they were not so greedy they could sell each and every SEASON for 15.00 and STILL make a fortune. That is why I will sit back and wait until someone puts it up to watch for free. Maybe if everyone that wants this release so badly were to write the studio something would get done!"
1,It's not even the money,"It's not even spending the extra money that bothers me so much. It's having to wait. It's very frustrating, especially as there are 9 seasons of the show. At this rate, it's more like 18 seasons. I will be in my 50s by the time I get to finish. Really stupid move. I will just get them on Netflix."
4,"""Because you told me to...""","Part of my Eng comp class reading - but fantastic. Katurian as the author and controller (or attempted) of the entire story and the stories within the story - it is so much happening in a world where nothing seems to happen - the ""black, black gloom of the empty, empty, empty forest."" The totalitarian police - and each character's backstory echoing in the stories of Katurian is also a circle that loops back onto itself. Hoping to see this play performed live shortly. The inner ""Pillowman"" story reminded me of some of DeLint's short stories."
5,Good stuff...,"I saw THE PILLOWMAN on Broadway before I bought it, and it was the best play I've ever seen in my life - and I'm a theatre major! Reading it was just as good. What a great play! Read Martin McDonagh's other stuff! And DOUBT by John Patrick Shanley."
4,Interesting,This play was actually quiet good and disturbing at the same time. I enjoyed the plot twists and the confusion that came about. If you are interested in reading a play about some sick people and tales of murdered children then this play is for you!
4,Looks can be deceiving,"The title of this play makes it seem harmless enough, and to some I'm sure it was very good. However, that being said, if you are not a gore/horror fan, then you might not enjoy this play very much. At least 3 or 4 times throughout the play, a short story is told describing a gruesome murder, and a lot of descriptive adjectives are used to give the reader a mental picture of what is happening. Overall, the story is very good; the plot was well constructed, and I think the story was told in a very unique way. BUT you might want to give it a second thought if you are prone to squeamishness, throwing up, or nightmares."
5,Remarkable! Sure to be a classic!,"This is Martin McDonagh's masterpiece---actually, I take that back. I hope he has more and greater works in him for years to come. We need them. This is a superbly theatrical tale that examines the nature and purpose of storytelling. Why do we humans feel it necessary to invent fictious worlds and examine our life not through direct observation of the real but of the invented? And in a land where personal freedoms are virtually nonexistant, how long can the storyteller survive, before he is done away with by the forces of control and order? The blackest black comedy you'll probably ever read, The Pillowman will remain with you forever. Don't just read it, see a production of it when it comes to your town, for surely it will."
1,The worst phone we have owned yet,We bought one of these sets and within a few month the volume/navigation control started to fail. pretty soon most of the buttons stopped working. I needed a replacement and thought it may have just been a lemon. Silly me! I bought a second one and guess what? Same problem in about 6 months. Don't waste your money on this one.
4,speaker phone,"volume could be a bit louder for me, so i go for the speaker phone feature, but once you select it, you're stuck until you hang up, ie, you cannot reverse speaker phone during the call."
4,Panasonic KX-TG6702B,"Quite pleased in general with features, answering machine operation, tone quality, etc. Two-line capability is quite useful. Range is better than that of most other cordless phones I've had, but only about half the distance my previous (about 5-year-old) GigaRange phone had. Operation is good anywhere in the house, gets spotty in the garage and more remote parts of the yard. Old phone was quite a bit larger and heavier, had a 3"" protruding blade antenna. This handset is considerably smaller and lighter, with an internal antenna--much easier to carry around in a pocket. All in all, a very good phone system with good but not exceptional range."
1,Not Reliable,The phone is OK but I have 5 handsets and 3 have failed over 1 1/2 years - terrible reliability. And todate Panasonic has not been very helpful.
3,Average Phone System,Good quality construction. Difficult to use. Have to hit too many buttons to call someone from your phonebook and select the phone line to use.
4,2 line phone,"Panasonic KX-TG6702B 2-Line 5.8 GHz FHSS GigaRange Expandable Cordless Phone System with 2 HandsetsThis phone is reliable with better reception/distance than its competitors. I'm a panasonic fan,they make a good product."
3,Hard to setup,I found the instructions hard to execute. But I am older guy so that might be the reason.
1,not even bad,Try getting the remotes to ring when a call is coming in...FORGET IT!Try setting these remote handsets up to work correctly... you need a degree in something that mine do not cover. I'm 2 tries away from sending it all back.
4,Good product but missing features,"This phone is fine. But we do not use the answering machine feature, rather use voicemail through vonage. The phone does not display any indication that external email is available. It also does not display any indication that a line is in use by a non-panisonic phone. Also it is not possible to turn up the volume on a call to a level that satisfies me. The Vtech phone I had previously did have all these features, but your reviews discouraged me from getting this again.And why doesn't someone offer a handset for a portable land line phone that is smaller than an elephant (ie is the size of a cell phone). This seems not to be available at any price. Iam getting closer to giving up landline phones for my iPhone, which is sensational on all counts, including the above, and so many others!"
3,PANASONIC TWO LINE HANDSET,"IT IS NOT WHAT WE EXPECTED AS WHEN YOU ARE IN ONE OF THE ROOMS IN OUR SMALL APARTMENT, YOU CANT HEAR"
2,Lousy customer service,"I bought my phone in June, 2007. In August, I decided I wanted to move it from one counter to another in my kitchen. To do that, I unplugged it. That apparently fried its little brain. So I had to pack it up and send it to Texas. It was two months before they sent it back. A remanufactured replacement. The adapter for the second handset was bad. Couldn't recharge the battery. I contacted them. Repeatedly. Finally got booted to the supervisor of a supervisor. Was told to fax my receipts. That was in February, 2008. It's now the middle of April. Still no replacement. I was told that they didn't get my fax. I have no way to prove that they did. I'm faxing again.Seems like a good product. When it worked, it worked just fine. But I don't think I've had more than six weeks of actual working time in the past 10 months that I've owned it.Panasonic used to be a good company. I wouldn't recommend their products again."
2,Panasonic 2 line 5.8 GHz phone,"I purchased this phone and used it for 2 weeks, finally returning it as there were too many missing features.Pro: Good voice quality, ability to share one or all directory entries among headsets. Worked well with normal POTs line and VOIP line.Con: Callerid doesn't display number if name is unknown, and would often not display anything even when other phone showed name and number. Since I screen my calls, this was unacceptable. Call log only stores unanswered calls. Had trouble reading display when awakened by phone ringing (before my eyes had a chance to adjust)."
1,Very Poor Quality,"Do not purchase these phones if you would like a product that will last more than 6 months. I purchased one base unit with 2 handsets and 2 extra handsets and within 4 months the speakers that operate the speaker phone and ringers went out in all 4 phones. I contacted panasonic and was instructed to send them in and they would be replaced with refurbished phone. One month later again the speakers are starting to go out on my relacement phones. Panasonic has instructed that I may send them in and they will replace them again, but this is getting to be a hassle as I do need to have telephones that I can hear ringing and that aren't on a ups truck somewhere in order to run my business."
4,almost exactly what I was looking for,"I wanted a good 2-line cordless phone. This fits the bill. The volume of the handset is fine. I use a headset. I don't even have to listen at full volume. The answering machine works fine. Good address book. Good set of other options. I'm planning to replace my other home cordless phones with additional handsets for this base station. I tested the range by walking to my mailbox about 150 feet from the base station. Worked fine.Three complaints: (1) it's a little pricey (they could offer a model without an answering machine) (2) the soft buttons are weird. They're recessed, so they're difficult to press. (3) The unmute is directly above the hangup button, and I've made that mistake twice so far. Doesn't Panasonic realize how often we're on conference calls and want to mute so we can sneeze, burp, etc.? Give me a dedicated mute button!"
1,Not a Reliable Phone System,"I purchased this phone for my home office. I needed the 2 line capability and the cordless handset (I didn't need or use the digital answering capability). Initially, the phone worked fine. Then at just 1 day prior to being able to return this phone, the base station speakerphone just stopped working. In addition, the base station started making a constant noise even when the handsets were docked and not in use. I would not recommend this phone to anyone."
4,Panasonic phone KX-TG6702B,"Its a very good/slick phone. Very easy to setup, and very easy to use. Only negative thing is that the caller id doesn't work sometimes.. not sure what the issue is. I would highly recommend it."
3,An OK product,Programming the phone is not intuitive. The display is difficult to read. The phone is easy to answer. Volume is loud enough. Too many steps to place a call after finding name in directory.
2,Replaced base unit twice. It failed again.,"There is something wrong with the buttons on the base unit. They stopped working after about a month. I got a replacement from Panasonic (refurbished base unit). It failed right away. I'm waiting for another replacement. Otherwise I like the phone. The handsets are very nice. The only extra feature I would like it to have is to beep if there is voicemail. It only blinks the light.June 2008 Update: 3rd base unit failed. All LEDs are on, none of the buttons work. All handsets display message ""No link to the base"". This is sad as I paid for extra handsets. I guess I have to buy another phone."
5,Panasonic 5.8GHz wireless phone - 2 line,Excellent all the way around. See my review of the single handset which says it all for the main unit which comes with two handset. You will not be disappointed. Excellent value.
2,It died on me,"Panasonic KX-TG6700, 5.8GHz Cordless PhoneI have had bad luck with Panasonic phones dying after a couple of years, but the features of this phone were what I needed so overcame my reluctance. The phone has worked fine for several years but this morning every light was on and the phone was inoperable. The issue is apparently the ribbon connector to the circuit board in the phone (a number of troubleshooting forums have addressed this problem), which i managed to disconnect to reboot the board. Now the handset is working again but not the base unit, and only if i leave the back off the base. Maybe Panny is taking a cue from the Auto companies who planned to have their products fall apart after a couple of years so you'd have to buy new ones. I don't know but this is the 4th Panasonic phone I've bought that did not live to a normal replacement age."
2,cordless memoryless,"I find this phone system OK with a few flaws: if the power blinks you loose the the time memory of your missed calls, The phone book does not have enough memory and the caller ID will not remember your numbers and associate with your phone book, Then there are the missed call display, any call answered by another handset comes up missed call!The sound quality and range is good as well as battery life. Not for a business."
5,works for me,"Our ancient Panasonic 2 line cordless could not hold a battery charge. After some research, this unit met all of our needs. It has expandability w/o a phone line nearby. It has a speaker phone on each handheld and the base. It has 2 lines on all units. It was easy to install (meaning I did it on my own!) and it is working just fine. Started w/just 2 handsets, but may buy more. We like the feature to set different rings for the 2 lines. Sound seems a little less clear than old phone, but did not do side by side comparison. So far (about 2 months) the batteries are holding charges very well."
1,Very Poor voice quality,"1. received the telephone 1 week late!2. Voice quality is very-very poor. Caller sounds like a computer generated voice. I am surprised that Panasonic, which has very good phones, made such a bad sound quality phone.My suggestion for folks would be to try other phones. do not buy this phone!"
3,Good handset but poor headset jacks,"While this phone has lots of good features -- especially clear reception for a pretty good distance using the handset's regular speaking method -- the jacks for a headset give tinny, soft sound, especially to the person you're calling.If you don't need to use a headset with your phone, don't worry about it (sound quality is good when not using a headset), but I talk on the phone all day for work, and need decent sound quality through a headset. Two good-quality headsets which have worked on other phones on both of these Panasonic units made me sound quiet and far away.The range was much better than the 2ghz phone I had before.The interface for saving numbers to dial is a little clumsy, requiring several buttons to get to the saved list, which I found annoying."
1,Defective Phone(s),"I could not use phone. The base unit would not activate, no dial tone, all buttons dead.I notified Amazon and received another phone. The second phone was also defective. Amazon customer service is very responsive.The 2nd phone did activate but the base unit was partially defective, some buttons did not work. Button #1,2 and 3 and the answer ""message"" button were dead,thus couldn't dial or listen to messages from base unit.I have used panasonic phones for many years and this is the first time this problem has occured.What are the odds in receiving two defective same product model phones?"
4,one of the better 2-line cordless systems available,"This is probably one of the better 2-line cordless phones available (and there aren't many). I tried the Motorola 2-line phones first, but after 2 years ALL of the LCD viewscreens were not readable. There could be an improvement in the range (especially through brick walls) in my opinion. Spead speatrum technology and phonebook sync between units is good."
4,Good wireless phone,"This is a good phone - not great , but good. The handset volume is a little low and depressing the phone line buttons is also a little difficult to switch from one line to the other. The portable design is good and it has all of the good features you'd expect. Other revewers gave great information and I'd recommend this phone if this is what you are looking for."
4,Great choice for a small office,"Great choice for a small office:- Support for 2 lines is a significant plus, especially given very moderate pricing- Tiny footprint for the ""base""- The base has the same, fully usable cordless handset (vs. a separate useless corded base in earlier models)- Speakerphone on each handset very helpful when dealing with extended waiting time on the line...- Good sound quality- Processes the FLASH button correctly for Vonage lines (call wait feature & three-way calls)(We do not use auto-answering mode, because we are using Vonage - works great with the Vonage box, supporting both lines.)Cons:- The only ones discovered so far are minor: the base has an LCD display, BUT this display shows neither the current time (when inactive), nor the call time (when speaking). So it was added for no obvious purpose..."
1,Buy this phone & your sure to have problems,I purchased this phone 4 months ago and have had continuous problems. The call quality is very poor and after 4 months of use the 1st line burned out. Very poor phone and I would not advise anyone to buy.
4,Satisfactory solution,"This expandable Panasonic cordless phone (Panasonic KX-TG6702B 2-Line) has proved to be audible when used to the ear or via the speakerphone, and the battery charge has lasted a suitable amount of time.Setup of the original, and a 3rd expansion handset were straightforward, and became useful quickly. Setting up the base station was the most complicated for us, as we did not want to use the built-in message system, and wanted to turn off most of the ringers. I did have to consult the manual for turning off the ringer on the base unit.The only feature I would ding is the lack of lighting behind the talk and speaker buttons, which makes it difficult to answer in the dark. The handset has a light when it is in its charging base; the screen is reasonable to read at night; but one will certainly fumble to answer the phone at night."
4,Panasonic 2-Line wireless telephone,"Not a lot of 2-Line telephones out there. This is one of the better ones.It has good range, good sound quality.It's not as easy to work with, several options are difficult to find and some standard ones are not included in this model.You will be happy with it but it's not the best in the world."
3,Was a Great Phone,"I've had this phone for less than 2 years and have loved it.Party over now since one channel now has very distorted audio on both handsets and through the speaker. When I switch the phone line inputs the same channel is bad. This is a little expensive of a device for that result.(yes, beyond warranty)"
4,Great!,"I am a nurse, so of course, I loved this. It has wonderful, uplifting stories. It would be a wonderful gift for any nurse, or for yourself, if you are a nurse or for anyone thinking about becoming one."
3,Classic interpretations,"These analog recordings were made in San Marco in Venice in the spring of 1967, and were legendary in their time. They introduced a large public to the great Renaissance master, in stunning sound. The digital remastering makes them even more spectacular sounding than their original LP release, revealing the rich acoustic in which they were recorded, which was the space for which this music was originally composed.Alas, the performances on this disc, legendary as they are, do not come up to the level of the recorded sound. The singing throughout is heavy and vibrato laden, textures are unclear and tempos are slow. We have learned much about performance of this music since 1967 and these performances now show their age. However this disc is valuable as a document, to be able to hear this music performed in the space for which it was written."
4,My boyfriend's shorts,"I bought 2 pairs of these for my boyfriend to take on vacation. He loves the shorts, they are a nice weight and comfortable. They are true to size and the only issue after 2 months is the button falling off, but that's nothing a little needle and threat can't fix, so 4 stars."
2,nice docu,some weird scenes. don't know how to rate this film. it's a well made docu but seems to be chinese pr.
5,Loved it!,"I just finsihed reading this book, and I loved it. Moncreif was absolutely adorable. He was arrogant, but most good heroes are. But he was also very kind and protective towards the woman that he had fallen in love with. Catherine wasn't your typical heroine. She was proud, competent, and loyal to her dead husband's memory, even though he didn't deserve such loyalty. I'm glad she finally found out the truth about Harry. I don't think I've ever read a Karen Ranney novel before, but I'm going to put her on my mental list of authors to be on the lookout for."
3,Good book. Some parts were too vulgar for my taste,"I enjoy historical romances. It is my genre of preference, however I found this book to be a little on the sexually explicit side. I like books with a good story line & great characters. This book had both of those but some parts were really pornographic in their description. Too much for this girl!"
5,A perfect romance,"An incredibly, sweet book. I absolutly loved Moncrief and I was actually surprised about the the villian. The sweetness of the love story between the couple was so overwhelming. This is one to not be missed."
2,Slow... Weak hero,I really wanted to like the characters but just couldn't feet into it. The plot was a great idea but not carried out to it's fullest extent. Wont be reading anymore from this author.
5,Entremont Ballades,"I rate the Entremont ballades very highly. It could be because it was the first complete set that I ever heard. I may be biased and I am not a musician. But I think there is a passion which is missing in the performances of some more famous pianists. I used to have the vinyl disc version, then I bought a CD version, which was borrowed and never returned by a friend, and now I am trying to track down another CD version if I can."
4,Cheap Adequate Ferrules,"I've been using these ferrules and they are completely adequate. The price is right, although they have a warning label that states, ""This product contains a chemical known to the state of California to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm. This product is intended for use of persons over the age of 12."" But it doesn't specify what the chemical carcinogen is? And why is this alleged carcinogen only known to the state of California? Not that I'm to worried about it, since my reproducing days are over. I figure since they're made in China they probably have cadmium or something in them. Just don't suck on them and i'm sure they're fine."
1,weak conditioning and the paragon of flimsiness,"I finally installed the thing afer jumping through quite a number of hoops. Although the size of my room requires 5500 btu, this unit (supposedly 7800 btu) cannot keep it cold.On a smaller note, here is one more present from geniuses of engineering at Panasonic. To take out the air filter on the unit you need to lift the grill, which you are supposed to do every week to clean the filter. First time i did it, i broke the plastic tab that keeps it on the cabinet, so the grill is hanging loose now. Whole thing is made out of flimsy plastic and generally have design and robustness of a small plastic plane model. Another part that breaks immediately is some flimsy thing they call frame guide. Whorever designed it should go back to Japanese prison where he must have taken his engineering classes."
1,"very flimsy, difficult to install","I bought this one on the consumer reports recommendation and i am pretty dissappointed so far. I haven't run this unit yet, so i don't know how it really works. What i could tell though is that it's tough to install. One of the problems is it is supposed to support itself by two massive bolts. But guess what, these bolts are too short for my sill, so i am running around hardware stores looking for bolts that'll fit.All construction of AC is incredibly flimsy -- there are small plastic details all over that my cat could break if she wags her tail. I would discourage anyone from buying this one. Panasonic should stick with electronics."
3,"Good, but there is better out there.","Pretty good vitamins. Not as good as ""The Men's Blend"" by Supernutrition, but also not as expensive.If you order from Nutricity, be sure to check the expiration date. They sent me some that had expired 9 months previously."
3,Products Good; DVD Not so hot,"I am very happy with the ball and the flex bands, one of the weights had a dent in it but I guess it still works the same. The only real disappointment was the DVD, it is like 10 minutes long and just plays straight through, there is no menu to let you jump around. I would recommend this product but if you are a beginner and need some training perhaps you want to order a separate DVD. Or better yet check out free pilates demos with the ball on youtube and Spark People."
4,Contain Mt Beast Somg,It is my My favorite song and mt favourite song .I am frat fan of Byena adama\
3,It's Okay...,Wand is weird and bends all the time. The whole thing is a little too heavy. Every now and then I'd accidentally smack our cat in the face with it and normally the toys bounce off and she doesn't mind but this is like hitting her with a brick. She's borderline scared of it. It's an okay product.
5,my cats favorite toy!!,my cat loves this toy. its her favorite one!!! she carries it all over the house. she'll even play tug of war with it. the feathers do wear out fairly quick but i keep a few replacements on hand all the time.
1,Not good,Feathers were soooohard & stiff..cat was not interested in playing with it.. I was afraid that feathers would scratch his eyes when he would look up at it
4,good read,"this was the last of a series. It was missing just a little something the others had but it was still a pretty good book and stood well on its own, like all of them in the series."
2,Will this storyline ever end?,"I'm sorry, but as I had thorougly enjoyed Ranney's novels in the past, I have endured all five of the MacRae novels. I kept hoping that a gem will emerge. No such luck. The first was okay, the second so-so and so forth.Please, please, please let the MacRae storyline end now. She hints in comments to the readers at the end that this is the end of the storyline...PLEASE say it is!!!The novel was a bit contrived, drawn out, and yes, as one reviewer noted, should have ended much earlier. As a short story or novella, it might have worked. As 366+ in small print, it doesn't.I'm sure the majority will disagree, and maybe I'm being too harsh and need to later give the novel one more chance, but more than likely it's to the used book store."
2,"Unenthusiastic, with bad sound as well","I would have to recommend against these. The Mozart is very blandly played. Even worse, it's too closely miked, so the sound of fingers click-clacking against the instruments is very prominent. The Beethoven is similarly uninspired, and recorded in a wind tunnel apparently. Wow, is there a lot of static. Sure, it's an old recording (mid 50s), but this is inexcusable. With the Dvorak, we finally see some signs of life. There is a pretty good performance hidden behind all the whooshing static."
5,A musical Christmas party from the boys from Boston,"New Edition is without a doubt the greatest R&B of all time. Their Christmas All over the World CD features the bys singing catchy Christmas tunes and ballads. All I Want For Christmas Is My Girl can't help but make you smile while Happy Holidays To You, It's Christmas All over the World and both version of Give Love On Christmas sound as good as ever."
4,"Good for the money, almost impossible to find until now","I have b/g twins and a son only 11 months older and needed a triple stroller. I had such a hard time finding one, that I bought this same model used on e-bay. It seems to be holding up well, but I often leave it at home, put my oldest and one twin in my double stroller and carry the other twin in a sling on my hip. We have it set up in our foyer and it is ready to go for outings to the park or around the neighborhood, but rarely goes to the mall. This will change when the kids get older. Glad I have one, but if I only had two kids, I would use a double stroller, not this one."
4,3 seat stroller,"I have just recieved 2 brothers and 2 sisters they're great.the stroller we got is good,but was pretty high,don't you think so.i think it takes up a lot of room in the back of our car but we got to have somthing to push Savannah,ConnerAnastey in Briley rides in a seperate stroller cause he only weighed 2 lb. & 8oz. when he was born he rides in a Evenflo stroller, we use careseats in the stroller just like the one we use in brileys stroller,we somtimes carry him in a pouch thing.love this stroller so does both of my mom and dad."
2,Please i need information,"I`m from mexico city and i`m lookin for a triplet stroller because my wife is expecting triplets, i`ll apreciatte if someone could send me information for this kind of strollers in the US, please send the information via e-mail to jorgesald@hotmail.com, i read the reviews here so i don`t need to check the quality of this beckendridge stroller, thanks."
1,Poor quality,"We purchased this stroller for our newborn triplets. We only had it one month when the middle seat back broke and we could only have it in one position. Trying to return it and get our money back was a nightmare. Ultimately we ended up with a store credit. Although the stroller does maneuver easily, the second seat has very little leg room and we could not envision it working for our babies when they were any older than 6 months. Our babies were tiny and the second seat was still cramped. Sadly there are not a lot of strollers to choose from when you have triplets. This one was relatively inexpensive compared to the alternatives but the product is poorly made and very hard to return. Purchasing it is a $250.00 risk."
4,mommy to triplets,I have this stroller and it is a great value for the price. We had to buy head supports for the seats till the girls could sit up and grew to about 13lbs we just used the ones that fit in a car seat. They love to ride in it now and they don't seem to care who is in the front. They are only 9 months now so that may come in the future. We could not afford the high priced big name brands so it was a perfect fit for our bugget.
1,"Very poor quality stroller, poor service from company","My son and daughter in law bought this stroller for their triplet daughters. The stroller's front seat leans so far back in its most upright position that the baby in the middle has absolutely no room at all. They have contacted the company and were instructed to send back in ""the original box"", which of course, being big and bulky was not kept, but thrown away. They have tried to find a place to repair the thing, but should not have had to go through this much hassle. I WOULD NOT recommend this stroller to anyone. It is very poor quality."
2,Large and definately in charge,"I ordered this stroller for my two and a half year old and twin new borns. I was really suprised how fast it was shipped that is why I am giving it two stars. Other than fast shipping, it was horrible. It was too hard to open and close. The weight of it nearly toppled over my 5'5 medium frame. I also contacted Baby trend to send me any attachments for the car seat and I never got a respond! If you can, just get the attachment for a double stroller (Like the sit and stand)"
4,Very nice for the price,"I'm a mommy of 7 month old triplets, and I'm just starting to really like this stroller. It is NOT good for babies who don't sit up well on their own (especially since it doesn't have five point harnesses). My sons still need a little something to keep them propped up. One of the great things about this stroller is that it seems to be the only one that folds flat without removing seats. You have to remove the front shade and the cup holder. I find that using the flat side of a key or a tweezer helps to remove the tray. I have no problem fitting it in the rear of my Chevy Venture."
4,So far so good!,"I recieved this stroller last week. I have 21 month old twins and another set of twins due in Nov. and I have to have a way to get out and about by myself.It was very easy to assemble, takes a few times to get used to folding it correctly, but it fits in the back of my expedition :). Also, I can get two infant car seats into it...BUT THEY DO NOT SNAP INTO PLACE (but fit secure). It also is easy to turn even when I place my older twins in the front two seats. Just as easy to push as my double stroller.Cup holder is GREAT!Please email me if you have any other questions. Vharm001@waldenu.edu"
5,Great product,The staff at our child care facility love this stroller.It is easy to load and unload the children and is especially easy to maneuver.
4,Breckenridge Triplet Stroller,"Awesome stroller for my home daycare. The only issue that stops this from receiving 5 stars is the fact that 1),it does not break down small enough to fit into the back of my Town and Country van (trying to remove the front tray in order to decrease the size is a bit difficult), and 2), when trying to fold it for storage, the middle foot rest always must be moved out of the way. Steering and handling works well. For the price, I recommend this stroller."
3,Fine for a while,"We have been the biggest supporters/fan club for this stroller for a while, but I have now changed my tune. I guess you get what you pay for. The front seat broke within the first ten uses of this stroller (newborn tripet passengers). We sent the item back to BabyTrend, and they were very helpful, fixing the seat. Well now, that same front seat is broken again, this time irreparably, I am afraid. My tripets are 16 months old and the middle seat is VERY tight (my smallest child is 22 lbs.) so we were considering going to a different stroller. Well, after this last problem with the seat, we are definitely going to switch. I am not sure that any of the in-strollers will have room in the middle seat, but we have to literally squeeze my little one in there!"
3,"You get what you pay for, not bad stroller reccomend for younger kids as it is tight fit for toddlers",This is a nice stroller but you have to take the tray off to get it to fit in the back of a van which is a pain it needs a better way to come on and off then the pins. The middle seat is a tight fit for an older child. But over all it is not bad otherwise. It is alot cheaper then any other triple stroller I have ever found. This is also great when your on a tight budget like us w/3kids under 3.
1,Too heavy - too big!,This stroller is way to heavy and way to big to fit in the back of my Ford Freestar van - the one time I used it at the mall I had to put it in the passenger seat standing straight up. I have 6 month old twins and a 2.5 year old. I agree with the others - the middle seat is very small - infant carriers do not fit in it - and it is very hard to steer with the 2.5 year old in front. I regret spending the $$$ on this stroller!!
3,It's okay for the price!,"I am a mother of 9 month old triplets. This stroller is beginning not to work for my babies. First of all, there is no room in the basket to place even a diaper bag. It is a very small area. Secondly, the middle seat has little room to grow. Thirdly, the seats are so close that the one in the back allows enough room for the baby to put his feet on the back of the seat in front. The stroller is also very cumbersome to collapse and heavy to pick up. It has worked okay up to now, but I think it is now time to invest in the Peg-Perego."
2,Be wary of malfunctions and inspect immediately,We ordered this triplet stroller when my daughter-in-law found that she was expecting triplets. We are pleased with the stroller except for the fact that the front seat will not stay in the upright position. Since we were past the 30 day period for return to Amazon and had discarded the box the stroller had been sent in we are evidently out of luck. For almost three months we have been trying to get through to the Breckenridge Company who only seem to have part time people working to solve problems. They have no suggestions other than sending the entire stroller back to them (we had discarded the box) which will take probably many weeks instead of sending a new one in exchange for the malfunctioning one. They also said they would send a mailing label which has not been received. We are very disappointed. They certainly do not seem to stand behind their product!! So be wary and check every aspect of the stroller IMMEDIATELY.
1,Parent of multiples,"I do not recommend this stroller to anyone! It is too heavy for any woman to lift, it is very deifficilt to fold, does not move forward or backward easily (especially on carpets), does not fit properly even in my huge SUV, and moving things in and out of the basket underneath is not convenient at all!! I am sending it back!"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!,"DO NOT BUY THIS STROLLER! It is poorly made, the company doesn't want to help you, and it doesn't work. When we received ours, it was broken when we took it out of the box. We received our replacement, and while my 6 month old was in the back, he was leaning to the side and the stroller scratched his face up while he was inside the seat and properly secured! Then the stupid thing broke! The front seat back rest bar broke and now the seat lays down into the middle seat. The middle seat already has no room as it is. This stroller is worthless. And we contacted the company back in October regarding this, and still have no resolution. It's a waste of $300. If you truly need a triple stroller, spend the money on one of the higher end models by another company. If it helps you further, we have toddler twins and a baby."
2,Not versatile,"I have a 2 year old and a set of 8 month old twins. I thought that this stroller would be perfect for my needs. Unfortunately this stroller wasn't available for purchase when I needed it last summer (some sort of manufacturer delay) so I had no choice but to purchase a used one (it was in great condition for being used). Although it is a sturdy frame, it is way too heavy to maneuver around when all 3 kids are in it (I'm only 5'4). It would have been easier to figure this out if it was available in store but try to find a store that will stock such an item, you can't. If I had purchased this stroller new, I would have returned it immediately. Now I know why the stroller was in such good shape. I was trying to avoid having to use 2 strollers but now plan on spending more money to purchase a double stroller for the twins and using a separate stroller for my 2 year old."
5,Great Stroller for my triplets,"I have two year old triplets Nicholas,Maggi,and Erin. I love this stroller alot. I looked and looked for a triple stroller but I never seemed to find one until I found this one. This one I use everytime I go out. It has held up every since they were around 8 months old."
4,Works but fragile,"I've only had it for a few weeks and thought I was taking pretty good care of it... but it's already seen a somewhat significant bend on one of the spokes. It still shuts and when it's open it is still plenty functional - I just hope this isn't a bad sign of things to come.But yeah, otherwise good price for what you're getting.Updated January 13, 2010: These things are incredibly fragile. If you have one on a stand and it falls, you will break it. Period. I've broken one of mine this way."
3,Makes a great ninja weapon!,"I was debating between this and the plain white shoot-thru umbrella and decided to pay the extra few $$$ to have the versatility of using it as a bounce as well. Wish I would have just gone with the white since I use the shoot-thru 95% of the time. Removing the black cover is easy. Replacing... not easy. Plus, once you remove the black cover the metal points are nearly razor sharp. Makes it quite dangerous. Also would be nice to have a velco strap attached like most umbrellas do to keep it secured when stowed. There is a nylon condom included for storage, but trying to get the umbrella crammed into it with the black cover is not easy. On the plus side, the shaft is rigid, the quality of material is pretty good, it compacts to a small size and as a light modifier, it does its job."
2,Not worth the money,"I got this as a gift and I was very excited to get it! It might just be my version but the construction of this umbrella is very poor. The white cloth comes off the ribs too easily (you expect that of the removable black cover) and I had to re-place each pin, for lack of a better word, back in the rib where it belongs. The worst part is that after opening it for only the second time, the white material was completely unraveling at the center of the umbrella and there's a gaping hole there.It's been babied, not man-handled so care wasn't the issue at all.I would recommend seeing a product like this in person so you can examine the construction quality. You want it to last more than a couple of times (literally)."
5,Producto profesional,"Luego de buscar y investigar sobre que marca comprar, lei en las lecciones Strobist, que ésta marca de Sombrilla y ésta medida eran las más recomendadas, compré una y ahora tengo dos, tienen una resistencia muy buena y excelentes condiciones de traslucidad, estoy muy contento con el resultado de mis fotos."
5,doesn't have a handle,"Sure, it looks nice ""optically"" but mine didn't have a handle.I looked like a total dufus standing out in the rain with this thing. Oh well.. I still gave it high marks as it did an ok job keeping off the rain and I assume I just got a defective copy.Simply too lazy to return for one with a handle."
4,A Potential Winner,I am looking into picking this item up. Strops do need conditioning from time to time. This could help. I always keep an open mind. I will be back to tell what I think for sure.The Time Keeper
4,Havana: A cultural and LIterary Companion,"the book takes the reader through all pertinent locations, historical periods, architecture, art, dance,music,culture of the region, travel between cities, photos of important buildings, regions in Cuba."
2,Cheaply Made,Works but metal connectors broke very easily. Probably have to be very careful with it. You get what you pay for
5,Wow!,This is what a science fiction book should be: more about the story than the ego (or paycheck) of the author.I want Spielberg to make it into a movie!
5,Greatest books evar! XD,"Wow, I really like ""Hunt Down the Prize"" & ""Knee Deep in Thunder"" my mom showed them to me, and I didn't like them at first, but now they're my favorite books, you should definitly read them!This book is about on Halloween, Maris and her friend go out trick or treating and get chased by older kids. They jump off a dock along with Maris' cat & dog. Maris and her dog (can't remember his name, noo!!!) remember being here before, just can't place it together until later on. They see people from their old group also."
3,I know it's a repro but....,"The quality of the print itself is horrible. It's like something that had been photocopied too many times, and much of the marginalia is a cursive blob you need to work to make sense of. Given the cost of this book, I feel my snark is justified. Had someone taken a bit more care I would consider buying more from this publisher."
4,Great rack if you can screw it to the surface rather than adhere it,"No problem with the seller. However, the key rack comes with both screws and double-backed adhesive mounting tape. I can't use the screws in my particular application. The placement of the tape as it comes form the manufacturer is such that I suspect part of the problem is that the tape can't make good contact with the mounting surface. Additionally the tiny bit of tap provided is simply not sufficient to hold the rack with 8 keys on fobs to the surface to which it is mounted. I like the rack and so am trying to devise another means of mounting it without screws."
5,Works Great,"I rounded up all my keys, threw out those that didn't seem to fit anything (although my husband dug them out of the trash can and put them back in the jar), labeled them, and hung the set in a marginally concealed space. Really makes me feel organized and prepared.Good product, good price."
5,BEST EVER,i love this song so much and had to buy the CD. i accidentally received the haiducci CDs initially and was EXTREMELY disappointed---i think ozone did a much better job with the cover
5,With Love from MOLDOVA!,"This is a MOLDOVAN song, performed by a MOLDOVAN band, O-zone (sung in Romanian, our national language).A romanian band, Haiducii, tried to copy O-zone, but they failed.The song is definitely the best dance song ever and I definitely urge you to buy O-zone's album.Do not confuse MOLDOVA with Romania, we speak the same language, we have the same culture, but we are two different sovereign states."
5,Excellent book about Marc Faber,"This is a excellen book and well worth reading. It does an excellent job of describing Marc Faber thinking way, which is an incredibly interesting for thos who can put it in biger context. I actually fund this book much more interesting then ""Tomorrow's Gold"". Must read!"
4,VERY Strong!,"Great product and reasonably priced - definitely did the job for us. Buyer beware ... when you stick the item to the wall that you want to secure - make CERTAIN that you are happy with the location before you place it. Once the item is in place, there is no taking it off the wall without causing possible damage. When we remove our items on the wall we will likely have to use a solvent or knife to remove from the wall and there may still be some minimal damage.Item as advertised and is definitely a quality product."
5,Critical Theology in an East German Context,"Baum does an excellent job of locating the major theological underpinnings of the former Protestant church in the GDR. His study is lucid, intended as an introduction to the East German context (1949-1989). For many readers, this book will open up a whole new understanding of the delicate position that the church in the former GDR held--it was not for socialism, not against socialism, but it was in socialism. In short, as Baum argues, the church leadership developed a unique position, one which was in ""critical solidarity."" Baum is to be applauded for laying out the (often complex) theological sources in a manner that the average reader can understand, but at the same time still technical enough to provide the North American English-reading scholar with useful insights."
5,Easy and fun!,"I have used this video almost everyday for the past 10 years. It is easy but also fun and not too repetitive.It takes about 25 minutes to get through so it's not a huge commitment but still gets my heart rate up. I have kept my weight within 5 pounds for the past 10 years even through menopause. If you have picture in picture on your TV you can still watch your favorite shows while doing your workout.Even my husband does it now :)Cheers,CJ CutayneAuthor"
4,The Book of Paper Quilling,"Excellent book for beginners like me, great for references later on. As a spanish speaker, found this book easy to understand."
4,Cute,"Its really cute but it presses around the belly button, scratching along the sides of my stomach. If you have a really flat stomach or have a short percing then you should be ok, but if you don't then I would find something that dangles rather than is wide and flat."
2,The book needs careful proofreading and editing.,This book contains many errors. It creates confusion and anxiety in the reader. Do not blindly believe the answers. Crosscheck it with Tintinalli's text when in doubt. Errors are noted in the answers as well as the explanations given.JMTMD
2,"A potentially good interpretation ruined by a strangely insane choice of ""speed virtuosity"".","Just like the other reviewers said, Newman is simply too fast. I also own his Goldberg Variations, which it turned out pretty good and unique, but not this CD. In my personal taste, most organ players, I have heard suffers for being slightly slower than I would have liked, but in the case of Newman, it seems that he is just testing himself to see how fast he can play. Now, if Newman makes another CD with the speed between this CD and what is considered to be the average speed, then I would gladly pay 10$ for such CD; for example, Toccata and Fugue in D minor he plays in 7:10. The ""average"" speed would be around 8:40 for that piece, and if he played ""a bit slower"" (say, at 8 minutes) then at that point the music could be enjoyable. But at this speed, Bach masterpieces are simply ruined."
2,Very very dissapointing,"OK - so scholarly research indicates that Bach was a user of ornaments. However, Mr. Newman's added ornaments and twiddly bits simply vex me to death.His interpretations are shallow, his tempi are so fast as to blur the line (in my humble opinion) and his choice of registration unimaginative. It's one CD I won't be listening to again ... might even give it away."
3,The complainers have a point...,"...his playing is way too fast in places. He just flies through phrases that E. Power Biggs would linger over and let develop.However, I think his rendition of the Passacaglia actually benefits from the speed, and BWV 543 isn't shabby at all in his interpretation.Look, the product is $5. It's not a bad deal at all. One thing is that the recordings will not put you to sleep; he does achieve a melodic line, it isn't all bluster and loudness and speed. There are musicians who, sad to say, can't figure out how to keep the melody going at all. Newman has no such problem."
2,wow...not good,"only things...Another lightning crack induced tempi recording by Mr. Newman, is he really good or does he just play stuff too fast to hear the wrong notes??Also...tempo issues as a result of the speed. There is phasing in the voices, inconsistencies, and poor balancing with the antiphonal and deeper located stops on this NY organ."
1,the pits,"Newman is a repulsive Bach organ performer, and has been for over 30 years. Those who praise him are ignorant of the music and how it is written and constructed. The playing is insanely fast, and only that, and that speed messes everything up. It's as simple as that. The phrasing is amateurish, the technique mediocre, the sense of structure practically non-existent. The weird thing is that for all the talk of virtuosity, Newman's playing and technique are pretty mediocre. Maybe it is the speed. If he slowed down, maybe he could play accurately and phrase musically. Or maybe not; it is not clear how musical a musician he really is. But the speed thing is just some neurotic compulsion, and you'd think he woulda done something about it by now, or someone would've suggested same."
2,Worthless on my cube walls.,"Bought these to use on my cubicle walls, but the fabric's ""pile"" is apparently thin enough that the velcro on these can't grab. It sticks for a day at best and then falls on it's own. I'm sure they'd be great on EXACTLY the right length of pile - not too long or short."
5,Perfect.,"I am able to put up all of my pictures in my cubicle now. With these mounting squares, my pictures have been up in my cubicle for at least two weeks, without falling. :)"
2,Did not work for me,"Bought these to hang photos at work. The squares would not velcro to the cubicle walls. The fabric on the cubicle wall must not be compatible with the squares. It was not worth the cost of returning these item, I will be throwing them away. Please make sure the squares velcro to your cubicle before adhering the squares to the item you are mounting because it is difficult to remove the adhesive."
5,Good stuff,This was good stuff. Had been looking for this item in all of the big-box office supply stores and unable to find. Glad I was able to locate @ Amazon.
5,exellent,this was good quality. arrived on time. was wrapped. no dents. was as described. :) :) XD XD :) ya
2,Useful if kept in perspective,"Casting my personal opinions on the subject matter of this work aside, I can still say this much: ""Between Good and Evil"" is a book containing several half-truths and unorthedox viewpoints, that may be deceiving to someone who knows little about the topics in question. William Grey has some rather vindictive things to say about several groups, particularly Satanists, and notably Kaos Magicians, that really push the boundaries of honesty. For this reason I advise the reader to be skeptical with this book - look things up, confirm, validate, etc."
5,Fletcher's Woman a must read.,"This book was great! Suspense throughout, I could hardly put it down. Linda Lael Miller was spot on with this book."
5,great condition,My books arrived on time and in fantastic condition.I am truly grateful for the convenience of amazon and there customer satisfaction.Thank You
5,New Fifth Edition is Even Better,"This is the new fifth edition of this classic book on typography that first began in 1971. Since then it has become a standard of the industry. It's real strength is how it describes fonts from the standpoint of conveying feeling, readability, aspects of fonts that you wouldn't normally think about.Type is an important part of graphics art. It is likely that in most projects type is what covers most of the page. Through the use of the proper type face, size, and special effects type can be used to assist in the conveyance of information which is what graphics art is all about.This book has been around for some thirty-five years. It is the standard text in design schools around the world. For this fifth edition it has been redesigned, printed in full color and had much new material added without omitting features that have made the book such a valuable tool."
5,Great Book for the Price!!,"For the price, you couldn't ask for a better introduction to typography. This book looks and feel great! It is well designed-very clear and straightforward. It is well written, give numerous helpful examples and tips and guides you through the information using pictures. I've read a good amount of type books and this one stands out as being one of the most helpful books on the subject."
2,"Pretty thin, really","I bought this book thinking I would get a ""contemporary"" alternative to Looking Good in Print. Hardly. This book may work as a classroom supplement with a professional typesetter teaching, but as a stand-alone, it is extraordinarily superficial. One simple case in point: There two pages on grids, consisting of the explanation that you can use one-column, multi-column, or no-column grids (duh). How to use them? Barely a word. Ironically, one illustration shows ""classic text proportions,"" but the only text referencing it says to make your outside margin larger than the inside margin, and the top smaller than the bottom. Well, I learned that in typing class.I was looking for a book that would actually help me improve the professional look of my printed documents. This isn't it. I should have known better. A book on typography that uses Helvetica body text on glossy paper? What did I expect?"
1,This is not a NEW collection,"Just a warning - I love Michael McDonald and his 2001 CD ""In the Spirit"" is one of my favorite holiday albums. So when I saw he had a new Xmas CD, I was excited. Well, FORGET IT. This is merely a repackaged ""In the Spirit"" CD. The music is wonderful, but don't make the mistake of buying this and thinking it's new."
4,great...hard to find christmas album,After searching the stores one christmas...and not finding it...I resorted to buying it online the following christmas...it was a gift for someone...she loved it.
5,The Spirit of the Season,"This McDonald collection of holiday music was originally released as ""In the Spirit"" in 2001.Christmas albums should fill you with the joy and spirit of the season and this one certainly does.Although, I'm not much into categorization this music is easily classified as Christian Contemporary. This project is also filled with the sound of the Doobie's, but McDonald does manage to make many of the previously treasured Christmas classics his own. Some notable guest musicians on a few selections include Jonny Lang on lead guitar and James Ingram on vocals. Jazz artist Kirk Whalum also offers up a few outstanding sax solos.On this project, McDonald has crafted a soulful blend of jazz, blues and gospel which sets the holiday mood and fills you with the Spirit of the Season."
1,Blowing too hard,I think I know the reason why all the tracks are out of tune..it's because of the recording technique and the fact that Mr Smith used a hard reed.This is why most of the tracks sound about a quarter tone off pitch.This is also why the sound is so perculiar and not at all like the usual bassoon sound.Overall a poor recording and the improvisation is not experienced or engaging.Hanson or rabinowitz remain untouchable
1,!?!?!?!?,"As one reviewer put it, 'it had to be done'. The only problem is that fact that it didn't HAVE to be done. I'd like the time spent listening to this album back. Bassoon is an awful instrument to learn to play (i've tried it) and it should never be attempted to play anything improvised again.The music itself among standard jazz is awful. The time falls apart on tunes like anthropology, the rhythm section is AWFULLY REMINISCENT OF DUKE ELLINGTON ON 'JOHN COLTRANE AND DUKE ELLINGTON', and the tuning is just plain terrible on every single track...just awful"
3,Ok,"This is not a book I would recommend to most readers. There is not much new here (conceptually) that is not explored in later works in more detail (this book is a collection of interviews.) Here it is still the early 90's, GATT was still alive, NAFTA is untried and there is no WWW. Chomsky is always brilliant and his insights into this world are even more interesting given how true they were shown to be.I enjoyed it. It gave me an opportunity to experience events I remember from 15 years ago with a very different worldview than I had then."
3,Is there a right wing conspiracy in America? U decide!,"Noam Chomsky is one of the most famous intellectuals in America today but for those of you unfamiliar with his ideas, be forewarned, he is very far on the left end of the political spectrum. With that said, I found this very short book, essentially a series of short question and answer discussions, to be a good introduction to his ideas and it left me anxious to learn more."
1,"If you don't LOVE Arnie, avoid this one....","I really like Arnold Palmer but this book bogs down in so much detail about every round he played in this event or that -- the succession of planes he had, etc. While there is an excruciating amount of detail here the book is lighter than popcorn when it comes to substance."
2,Nice format--needs work,"One of the strengths if this book is a very pleasing format that uses the subjects themselves as decorative illustrations. A picture here is worth more than a thousand words. The introductory matter is informative and well presented. Unfortunately a glaring error present in a former edition is perpetuated in the current volume. Laphroaig is labeled as a northern highland scotch, when it is clearly labeled and well known as coming from a distillery on the southern coast of Islay. The fact that this mistake appears in another edition makes one wonder whether poor editing or poor research is at root. In all, a nice little volume. However, if you can only get one refernece book on the topic, get Michael Jackson's."
4,Interesting CD,"I bought this CD because of the song 'Seasons in the Sun', but have enjoyed listening to the somewhat quirky other songs."
4,The Happy Years!,Certainly not Academy Award caliber. But I enjoyed it. Good characters. Great setting. Boys growing into men and characters like the Ol Roman leading the way. Very worth while purchase.
4,ENTERTAINING!!!,"Yeah, these are two of Van Cleef's schlockier Spaghetti Westerns done when the genre was in decline. However, if you really need to see either (or both) of these two gems then this is the one to buy. It's put out by Digiview and is in a slim case as pictured. Both movies (...both of which I happen to like, especially GOD'S GUN) are in pretty good shape and are on a one-sided dvd which prevents scratches common in ""flippers"".This is indeed a great buy for any Van Cleef/Spaghetti Western fan!If it's still available and you need to see these films (you know you do) then make this purchase. Two Spaghetti Western oddities for peanuts!!! Buy and enjoy...mabbe with some Italian wine and/or beer...and especially CHEESE!!!GREAT STUFF, need more be said?"
3,God's Gun/Kid Vengence,"Although it does not appear that either of the features of this double feature DVD are digitally remastered, the quality is not too bad. There are flaws that appear in the videos periodically but they are not terribly distracting. I did not like that both features are on the same DVD. I felt that if they were one movie to a DVD, they may have been better quality. Neither movie has a chapter list. The DVD is priced right for what you get, although, I think the seller should inform the buyer that they are not getting something digitally remastered."
2,No Hertzfeldt??,"Any overview of today's animation is woefully incomplete without a section on Don Hertzfeldt. He's hands down the most important American animation film maker alive. One can only guess that he just didn't want to be involved with the book??Otherwise this book is an OK, but very scattered look at some famous names in 1970's and 80's animation."
4,The Haunted - The way Survivor should be,"The Haunted was my first of the Buffy/ Angel Books available and certainly not my last. I've always been fscinated by the show as vampires have always interedted me since Barnabas Collins.I found the book very enjoyable to read with out the aouthor getting lost in the many plots that end up being one. The ending was quick, exciting and fascinating pulling the whole text into one plot.Cordelia's role in the book was outstanding although I thought Angel could have played a bit larger role since it is entitled Angel - Haunted.It's hard to place these books into the timeline associated with the show which someone who is an Angel/Buffy fan should do. Buy this book as it is great fun and the delving into ghosts varies from the normal demon hunting lives of our heroes although the demons are still pulling all the strings.I'm onto read BTVS Book of Fours and soon to start the Giles book. Look forward to reading other books by the author as well"
5,Angel: Haunted,"This book was great!Cordelia has a vision while at the house and has to give clues to the gang threw the show. Gunn's gang find out that a women's body was dumped with no identification marks what so ever. What's the deal and are the two related? You have to read to find out. This book had me from the first page, I couldn't put it down. The story with Cordelia in the ""Haunted House"" was what had me keep reading. I also love the fact that it showed Angel, Gunn, and Wesley all doing their own thing to figure out the case. This is one of the better Angel books I have read and I recommend it to everybody!"
3,Officer Gunn,"It took this reader two months to receive this book. It wasn't worth the wait, but the novel was intriguing. Mariotte doesn't create new character dimensions for our ""Angels"" (Cordelia, Gunn, Wesley, Lorne, Angel), but he explores what each character means to the other. It's an ""Angel"" episode with a hint of sensitivity. Every ""Angel"" fan knows how evil the law firm of Wolfram & Hart can be, but this storyline confirms that there's no ""heart"" in the law firm. Lilah Morgan is deliciously evil. The plot was predictable and Mariotte should use more colorful adjectives, but it was a fun novel to read."
2,shame...,this novel was maybe one of the worst books i have read about Angel. i was very excited to read just an Angel book that wasnt a crossover with buffy. and i am dissapointed. im not sure if its because its a young adult book or because the author just doesnt know how to capture the characters in book form. either way its to bad i wasted my time on this. i hope other Buffy books will be better but i prolly wont read another one of these Angel books. i have read other buffy verse books and have been happy. Queen of the Slayers was damn good and Monster Island the Angel/Buffy crossover was also good. but this book never captured the personallity of the characters and it felt like really bad fan fiction.
4,great,this is the first angel book i've ever read and i can tell you it wont be the last these books are great!!!!!!!! they really bring the characters to life and they dont make them to different to the tv characters. the writer jeff mariotte is wonderfull he really knows what he's writing about. even though i'm a huge charmed fan i have to say these books top those as they're longer you can really get into them and an intrieging plot can be set up.even if your not an angel fan but just want something griping and exciting to read. this is the book for you.
3,"Good laptop, crippling design choices","This is a pretty decent tablet for the price. Toshiba managed to pack in a fair amount of processing power, and although small the screen is crisp and remains clear even after years of tablet use.However, there were some bone-headed design decisions that hurt the usability of the laptop. One reviewer mentioned how they've positioned the off button. I shut the tablet off several times by mistake before I realized what was going on. How did that get past testing?The worst decision, from the perspective of a techie, is that there is no way to boot from a USB CDROM or DVD. This means that unless you have a special PCMCIA-attached CDROM, you can't actually install any other operating systems.A cute laptop, but obviously designed for the segment of the market that doesn't change any of the pre-installed options. For technical users, that's a killer, and even for non-technical users, the inflexibility hurts the resale value."
3,"on off button a problem, but only if you are right handed","I'm pretty sure this was designed by a lefty. Because if you are right handed and are using the tablet feature, your palm is forced to sit on the on off button. At least it restart fairly quickly. Also , it does not come with Onenote."
3,Does not hold iPhone,"The iPhone does not fit in this cell phone mount.It is a great design and gives you several different mounting options. Would work great with my car too, but doesn't fit my iPhone :("
4,"Good cell phone, MP3 or other device holder","This comes with a sticker or a vent clip to mount. I could see how this might not fit in all cars by the vent clip, but I made it work in my car. It is great for holding my RAZR while I use a bluetooth headset or for holding my police scanner. It does block the cell phone screen a little, but I can read who is calling."
3,READ CAREFULLY,"The bit says 2-7/8"" long. This is the total bit length, not the cutting length. The cutting length is only 1-1/4"""
5,read it--it's fun,"I just finished reading Chin Music and I have to tell you it's fun, fast-paced, fluent--a pleasure. If you like coming-of-age stories, you will enjoy the amazing escapades of Henrietta Fine. If you like American literature, you will enjoy references to some of our great works (especially Huck Finn and Gatsby). If you like American history, you will enjoy learning about the Jazz age from the bootleggers' viewpoint. If you like dialect, you will have a chance to learn gangsterese and jazz slang. If you like lyrical prose, you will find plenty. If you want your reading time to be an adventure that helps you appreciate other people in other times, you won't be disappointed."
5,Boz Takes Us Back,"""But Beautiful"" is a heavenly trip back to the days when music was music. Boz's voice has never been finer - he seems better suited to the standards than to the still-fantastic rock that he has given us over the years. Arrangements are lush but understated, musicians are top-notch . . .This has become a staple in my album collection. Anyone who loves the music of the Big Bands must own this album!"
3,Euan Morton's New Clear,Great product! Euan is a incredible artist who is well on his way to super-stardom.
5,Such a delight!!!!,"I was thrilled when I first received and listened to this new CD by Euan Morton. It was worth every penny! There's not a song in the bunch that I ""skip over"" (for not being a favorite) because each song is pure pleasure. Euan possesses one of the warmest, most amazing voices of our time! Don't miss this one!"
5,"One Clear, Smooth Voice!","I first heard Euan Morton from the opening clip on Culture Club's 20th Anniversary Concert DVD - I thought, what an outstanding voice.Boy George said it best, that he did ""him better than I do, I'm scared"" ... it's true he was very good as the Boy.Ultimately it led to a Google search and the purchase of this CD. This is a very good CD - with a very smooth clear voice in Euan Morton. Outstanding.My favorite songs though they all are good, are Hallelujah, Victims and Pie in the Sky - the latter 2 George O'Dowd tunes.An outstanding CD by an outstanding new voice.Nancy"
5,BIG talent,"After hearing Euan's voice on the musical 'Taboo' soundtrack, i knew that i had to buy this. If you haven't got the recording of 'Taboo', get it!I can't wait to hear what he does next."
5,Beyond The Foster Care System: The Future for Teens - highly recommend,"Very informing and troubling as well. I am a CASA to a 17 year old, and it was a good book to learn more about what can be done for these young people."
3,Good,The book reveals how thousands of young lives are wasted because teens in foster care are not prepared to living in the outside world the authors have a new and proven successful approach tha gives these teens a chance to reach their goals and be productive citizens of societyThe book holds the reader' interest for it's an important story well toldC Reed
4,Author of RETURNABLE GIRL,"Oh yes, the system is broken. We need to be creative with how we fix it.Foster teens are among the most vulnerable of our population. We all need to advocate for them, even as they learn how to advocate for themselves. Thumbs up for anyone who can offer viable solutions and ways around the ""system."" There are still plenty of teens who are adopted, however, and who benefit from a ""forever family."" For those who aren't this book offers hope.Pamela Lowell, MSW, LICSW, BCDAuthor of Returnable Girl about a teen in foster care and her journey to adoption."
4,"(4.5.) It's not baby makin music, but it's still hot","This is a GREAT return for both of them, they have been doing it for a long time and this adds to thier great selection. I dont think the title fits the album because its not baby makin music (Caravan of love) because it is new school music. I still find it a good album"
3,pretty Good,"now while I was hoping more R.Kelly writing&Production would be on this Album this album has a few decent joints.""just came here to Chill"" is a Nice cut. but R.Kelly' s ""Blast Off"" which is a duet is a Classic. Jermaine dupri&some of the other Producers are just trying to re-play what alot of 90's Hip-Hop sampled&Looped off he Isley Brothers Rich History&also you heard alot of R.Kelly influence.i still don't know why&how Tyran ""Ty Ty"" Smith got any credit on this album,but that's the waste of Money by Jay Z there. anyway this Album ain't as good as ""Body Kiss"" but it is smooth."
2,Fighting the Power,"As a Isley brother fan from waaaay back I always knew that an Isley brother album could be bought unheard. You were guaranteed dance music to sweat to and some of the sexiest, mellow slow jams you ever want to hear, but this CD just didn't do it for me. There are ghosts of old melodies and Ron still sounds silky but the songs are flat and there's not one song that will stay in my memory. R. Kelly seems to be appearing for filler and to appeal to a younger audience but his cut doesn't really deliver the goods either. All in all this CD is added to my Isley collection but it's just not the gem I expected nor will any babies be made here."
5,They just keep getting better,I am fan of The Isley Brothers and other fans will agreed this is a must have for that collection.
2,Analogous to Enquirer Magazine.,"This book was originally presented to me as an example of 19th century anti-Catholic fervor. I own, and have read the 1836 edition of this book. I believe the first edition was quite popular in it's day, and sold thousands of copies. While the Catholic Church, as well as Protestant churches were certainly deserving of some negative sentiments in those days, Monk was later exposed as a fraud. It should not be taken as fact, but can be used to bring about interesting discussions in religious history courses. Presumeably, the current reprint will be used for that purpose. The book is analogous to the Enquirer Magazine of today. It's not the kind of book I would want to be seen purchasing. I bought mine from a rare book store by mail."
4,Important remnant of its time.,"While the below reviewers berate this book for containing blatant lies, it is a well-known hoax and of serious historical interest. It's a bit shocking that one reviewer actually believed the hoax -- but then again, perhaps his credulousness is understandable given the very real scandals of the modern Catholic Church.For an informative contrast, compare this book, entirely fabricated and written in the style of a cheap gothic novel, with the Boston Globe's very factual _Betrayal: The Crises in the Catholic Church_. It seems to me a positive sign that the recent real problems in the Church have resulted in the reviling of only the most likely actual criminals, rather than the wholesale and vicious anti-Catholic sentiment that came from the publication of Maria Monk."
4,A unique perspective on a time not particularly studied,"Having a great interest in Elizabeth and her reign, I found myself very curious about this work, which claims to analyze the period between the death of Elizabeth and the rise of the first Stuart king, James.While de Lisle delivers on everything that she promises, some parts of the book seemed to drag on as she sidewinded off into some explanation or another regarding some miniscule point that never really pans out to much of anything. Believe me, there are enough key players involved in this work to keep straight.While it does handle the ""rising and setting sun,"" I think de Lisle does not spend enough time really fleshing out a very interesting point she makes when she compares the overall historical reflection regarding these two reigns. She spends about the last two pages talking about this, but could have spent a chapter going over this (it was really fascinating but very brief).A worthwhile read."
3,After Elizabeth: The Rise of James of Scotland and the Struggle for the Throne of England,"I've read and prefer Allison Weir's books on the Tudors and wanted to continue down the line to successive rulers. This book by a different author is a slow read tends to drift from the main topic somewhere in the middle. It is still interesting enough since I am very interested in 16th century England and beyond, but I'm not a fan of this author's writing."
3,Take your time to read this book.....,"Linda de Lisle has undertaken a tremendous amount of research before setting pen to paper - that is quite obvious. Her problem, however, is that she begins to stumble when it comes to meash this wealth of information into a narrative that keeps the reader's interest and retains coherence. This is a difficult task, and with new players entering the scene at regular intervals, a substantial challenge. De Lisle has made a sterling effort, and succeeds in getting the message across that James' succession to the throne of England was all but a forgone conclusion. However, it is a difficult book to read, and one requires a lot of patience and time to do so. I am inclined to say that it is worth the effort, but it requires more stamina than it should."
2,Didn't Enjoy It,"I found this short history tedious. I could not immerse myself in it and often found myself putting the book down out of boredom so that it took me much longer to read than many longer histories I've read in the past.I believe the main problem is that the author condenses too many characters in the space without rounding the characters out; I do not find myself interested in them because they appear wooden...not enough insight into their personalities and not enough color given to their backgrounds. I feel the author's past as a journalist has influenced her here. She can write volumes of information, but it doesn't seem to engage the reader on a deeper lever than a newspaper story might.I enjoy Christopher Hibbert and Alison Weir more. They convey complex historical events with a gift for giving the reader a feeling for the time and they have an ability to communicate characters on more of a flesh-and-blood level. Too bad. I was looking forward to the book."
2,Calling Dr. Myss' Guardian Angel!,"I used to think the world of Caroline Myss. Pinkola Estes and Myss make a wonderful, magical combination. However, Dr. Myss is getting pedantically infatuated with herself, to the point that she has become her own self parody and worst archetype. It is finally becoming clear in her recent presentations that she enjoys ridiculing her audience and that she uses her sharp tongue and mind to belittle our shortcomings and fears. Intuition and the Mystical Life could have been a great edition, but Dr Myss's input did not help Dr. Pinkola Estes' great contribution. I feel sorry for Myss and wish that her guardian angel would rescue her from herself."
4,Nurturing with a shadow...,"I had heard of C.Pinkola-Estes and C. Myss prior to purchasing this CD. I've never gravitated towards Myss' work so I didn't expect a huge message from her contribution to this collaboration. Despite the jarring and borderline arrogant remarks from Myss, there are many messages that are offered and highlighted in this CD. Estes has a natural inclination to draw reference to the popular and personal experience. Myss shares lots of personal experience and often supports her opinions with the preface ""To me..."". I want to give this 5 stars but I'm thwarted by Myss' brass tone of voice and almost similarly choice of language. I think it's worth a purchase and the consumer could benefit from the message once he/she can get past the messenger...seeing ""between the worlds"" so to speak."
3,Good book but also read www.eclipse.org articles,First four chapters of this book are an excellent introduction to EMF. Last section of this book wastes too many pages by listing reference APIs. I would highly recommend that you read equally important EMF overview documents available on the www.eclipse.org site before you buy this book.
4,Best and Only Book on EMF,"This is the best and only work on the Eclipse Modeling Framework, which is the code generation engine built into the Eclipse IDE. It's a solid work, but it's one flaw is that it is neither a completely how-to book, nor is it completely architectural work, so it will probably frustrate most readers to some degree. This is the only reason I didn't give it a perfect rating."
3,Not introductory as I expected,"This book served as my introduction to Eclipse, and I found it not as helpful as just playing with Eclipse itself. After play time was over, I went to the book again, and saw some improvements that I could have used.I don't mean to say that the book is bad. It's a little overweight with Java references, true, but it still covers one of the best Java IDEs available, and the fact that it's better than many commercial IDEs just makes it more pleasing.I believe I got this book when I wasn't ready for it, or when I wasn't the main target audience, and that this may skew my perception of it. In any sense, the book just wasn't my piece of pie, but I can see it being someone elses."
4,Very soft and warm.,"I have had the slippers for a couple of weeks and I like them very much so far. They are very comfortable and warm and I like the sole which will allow me to run outside when needed. My only concern is they are a bit difficult to get on. I do have to tug a bit but the loop in the back makes it easy. I like them so much, I am considering purchasing another pair."
1,Picture does not represent product,The bootie is not anything like what is pictured.Instead of a suede boot with fur trim. I received fuzzy furry slippers.A certain return with less than a week before Christmas.
5,Women's Chinchilla Bootie,"These slippers were a gift. The recipient lives in a place where it gets cold, and she says these slippers were warm, comfortable and wonderful."
5,Best baby towel out there,"This towel is one of the best I've found. It is thick and very soft, and it is nice and large. Some of the other baby towels are quite thin. Washes well too. A great buy."
3,nice but not so soft,i got this for my newborn baby.It is a nice big towel that can be used till my baby is a toddler but it's not as soft as you want infant towels to be.I use it and my baby's skin got used to it :)
4,ÈÄ,I love the color and design of this wrap . Above all large size packing my two-year baby is good.
4,Cute and hidden counting,"Of course, the age group for this story is too young to count, so it is a fun way for us parents to slyly introduce counting to our little ones.For those looking for another idea to actually ""kissing"" their child throughout the book, I use a light pinch with my fingers to simulate the kisses at different places on his body when snuggled up closely with my 2.5 year old son. He finds it amusing and giggles because it tickles him.Enjoy."
2,Hasn't taken yet.,I don't know why--maybe when we get to counting and numbers our son will like it more. But he's had it for half his life (9-18 months) and doesn't show any interest in it.
2,Too cutsy and too long,"I love Karen Katz books, and so does my daughter. However, this one was a little disappointing because it was too wordy for each page. I wanted the concept to be about affection rather than counting. On the other hand, my daughter and I enjoy it with our own words to each page, and that works!"
2,A Bland Book with no variety,"It would have been nice to see at least one baby of color in this ""dry"" book. It's obvious the author wanted the reader to use this book to help coax a sleepy child waking up into starting the day with a tickle and/or a laugh. But I was bored with the book. The color's used to illustrate the babies and background had no variety."
3,cute story but baby couldn't care less,I ordered this because it sounded adorable but my baby couldn't care less. She is 10 months now and she tolerates it now better than 6 months but she is just barely letting us finish it without getting fussy. I think maybe when she understands body parts she will like it better but the text is a little long and the pictures are too busy for her. She doesn't have the attention span for a story and this doesn't have any animals or lift the flap or touch and feel so she is over it before it even starts.
3,Maybe for an older toddler?,"We received this book as a baby shower gift before my daugther was born. My daughter never showed an interest in this book, even with my husband and I engaging her with kisses. She is now 18 months and still does not like this book that much. I'm hoping at 2 years old she may grow to like it."
4,Counting Kisses,This was an adorable children's book. It was a great way to get the parents and their kids to interact while reading the book. It's a cute counting book that I think the children will enjoy and have fun reading.
4,Maybe not for bedtime...,"My son loves getting kisses and so loves this book. It's very fun to read to him. He gets so worked up, though, that we can't read it at bedtime."
5,My toddler loves this book!,"I received this in a lot I won on eBay and I'm very glad that I did! It's very simple and short and my 18-month-old loves it. I've only read it to him about 5 times, but when I pick the book up, he knows exactly what it is and raises his little feet in the air poised for me to kiss. It is too cute! The only complaint that I have is that this is not a going-to-bed book at all as I think it's supposed to be read before night-night time. I do read it to him before bed, but if you have a kid that is hard to get to sleep anyway, you might want to skip it or read it during the day. All the kissing gets kids fired up and giggly, or at least for my toddler!A kiss-and-read book starting with ten kisses on ten tiny toes down to one last kiss on his/her sleepy dreamy head."
5,This is a cute gift,My son like this book so much we purchased the little set for my neice. The little stuffy is the perfect size for little hands.
5,The best book I have ever bought for my little girl,This has been my little girl's favorite book from 3months to 1year. She can not get enough of it. This book teaches her body parts and I get to kiss her alot (which I love).
4,MWAH! Delightful!!! But buy it early...,"Such a tender book!It's a little bit more juvenile than I thought it would be, though, (hence the 4 stars.) as I bought it to read to my 2 year old. The langauge is more geared toward babies (chubby knees and wriggly feet etc.) but it works out well for us anyway because I have a 4 month old and my toddler shares the kissing fun as we read it to the baby together.The book illustrates mommy, daddy, grandma and pets giving kisses good night so it's fun a way to start reading to your baby, and a great way to introduce and involve other family members too.A lovely book over all."
4,If only it were that easy!,"I love reading this book to my feisty 16 month old boy, & he actually manages to sit through it! The pictures are vibrant, & the pets help! He looks forward to me 'acting out' the words, & it's a great time together. However, getting him to sleep afterwards is not as easy as the baby in the book!!"
5,Counting fun,"It was a wonderful way to start counting with the baby. There were a lot of smiles and giggles while reading and the kid didn't want the book to end. Engaging, very positive. Would recommend it to any affectionate parent."
4,Adorable!,"This book is so cute! I bought it for my son, who is due in June, and I can't wait to kiss his soft skin after each page! The illustrations are colorful and I love how it shows not just baby with Mommy, but also with other family members, including a pet cat and Grandma. I know this will be read weekly when my little baby finally arrives."
4,Cuddly babies will love this book!,"My 18-month-old has loved this book since she got it a year ago. It has held up well and still looks great! She loves the pictures, especially the first picture captioned, ""My tired little baby, do you need a kiss?"" and she will lean in to get a kiss! The only hard thing for me is that it's hard to get to belly buttons and toes and chins to kiss them, if you are holding baby in your lap and trying to read! It's a great, cuddly read anyway!Update: My daughter is almost 30 months old now, and still loves this book! She always wants a kiss with the first line, and she loves to point out the family members in the book. She loves every Karen Katz book that we have."
5,GREAT !,GREAT BOOK ! MY DAUGHTER ENJOYS COUNTING AND GETTING KISSES AT THE SAME TIME. FUN READING FOR BOTH PARENT AND CHILD.
5,My daughter's favorite book.,"It was the first book that we read to our daughter. The illustrations are beautiful and simple. At nine months, one can tell that she still exhibits the most interest in this book compared to the others we read to her."
5,Love this book,I love this book and so does my 16 month old. I even bought a copy for a friend. It is cute and simple. It helps with counting and learning body parts and it has colorful illustrations that my baby likes to point at.
5,The cutest little book!,I love this book but I got more use out of it when I memorized the words and put the book down. You reall need two hands to kiss and cuddle all your baby's body parts as it describes in the book.
1,Left for Dead,Horrible.... absolutely horrific.... Not even worthy of a B grade movie...by the way not the Danielle Harris movie if that's what your search was.
1,not an indoor stove as adv. per their own instructions,"this is advertised as an indoor stove to heat water for uses like a shower while camping. I bought it for 123.46. When it arrived promptly the instructions stated don't use inside dangerous, could be fatal etc.I contacted seller and manufacturer which both stated their lawyers made them write it but it wasn't true. I should go ahead and use it anyway and ignore their instructions.Yeah right. When my 5 kids end up dead what then?They refuse to reimb. me for shipping rtn. of $29.75. Now I have placed no less then 14 long over an hour each calls to Amazon to invoke the A-Z amazon guarantee to get refund and rtn shipping. Never deal with these people. A complete nightmare."
4,An Unexpected Italian Thriller,"Having loved Rappoport in Tornatore's thriller ""La Sconosciuta"", I looked up and found this other thriller set in Turin by Capotondi. The director did an amazing job at keeping you confused and nevertheless intrigued with unexpected twists while you try to figure out Rappoport's character and intentions in this film about deception.I am looking forward to watching more of Rappoport and Capotondi's films."
3,"Double crosses, misdirection, and deception","A well done suspense mystery with a bit of action, more than a bit of romance plus some double crosses, misdirection, and deception. Has a bit of a Hitchcockian flavor to it."
3,A lot to keep up with,It's not a bad film; I just had a lot of distractions while watching it. It is the kind of story that requires your complete attention the whole time. Things are not at all what they seem and neither are the people.
2,This is not the full kit pictured !,"We decided to order a snake bite kit after encountering a 6 foot diamondback while hiking just off the Blue Ridge Parkway in the NC mountains. No one was bitten, but when you are walking on a trail and look about 2 feet to the side of where you are walking and see a snake this size, it is a bit worrisome.The pump and attachments in this kit appear quite functional and it provides a lot of suction. However, this includes only the pump and attachments, it doesn't include the swabs, band-aids and razor which are shown it the pictures. It mentions that only the pump is included in the text part, but this is pretty expensive considering it is not a full kit and most of the other available kits include other needed items.In any event, it makes us feel a bit safer during hiking now."
5,Many Varied Uses,"This extractor is great for a VARIETY of uses. It's great for it's intended purpose, such as bug bites, bee stings, etc., but it is also great for getting out splinters, glass slivers, blackheads, etc. It has an incredibly strong suction capability. Yet, is not painful, and does not leave a mark."
4,Nice and simple,"I bought this for backpacking trips in the southwest U.S., where rattlesnakes are not uncommon. It a lightweight and simple piece of insurance that I'll hopefully never need to use."
2,Not a Beauty Item,"*I realize Amazon hasn't touted this as a beauty item, but many other places do and I wanted to write this review for those who found this item in the manner I did.*I attempted to use this as some other posters mentioned - for acne in addition to insect bites. On several beauty sites, this was touted as a great way to get rid of blackheads, etc. Not even close. Deep cysts, it helps bring to the surface a bit, but definitely not for smaller blemishes.I'm writing this review for those of you who happen upon this item in the same manner I found it. This is NOT a beauty tool and will not help with clogged pores.Hope that helps those of you who were looking at this item as I originally was! Best wishes to you folks who wanna go camping with it."
3,Good for non-urgent stuff,"I have tried this pump and found that it is good for insect bites. It can be an effective tools to draw acne too. What I am not sure about is the snake bites. The flow is very slow and unless the snake got one of yr major vein or artery, you are not going to pump out much poison. So do not count too much on this."
5,"The ""bible"" of aquarium resources! A must for the beginner.","My husband-to-be and I purchased an aquarium for my daughter a few months ago. We soon ran into a host of problems. First, the water remained cloudy. Then, the tank had a smell. We loved having a lot of fish -- then all of a sudden we started losing them. We couldn't understand what the problem was and my fiance was on the verge of forgetting the whole aquarium idea -- until I purchased Mike's book. Within a few minutes, we established the problem -- overfeeding, too many fish, and too high ammonia levels -- and were able to take quick corrective action. Plus, this book is literally packed with information about plants, test kits, filters, and even the best fish to buy. Now our aquarium is beautiful...and I've come to love my new hobby!"
5,This book is awesome for beginners!,I bought this book when I first set up my tank and it has guided me through every step of the way. It gives shopping lists for other things you need for the tank. This book should come with every freshwater tank. What I like mostly about this book is that the author never lets it get boring. He incorporates humor and doesn't go on and on about one thing.
4,A Must-Have,"Reading this book is like having an aquarium-expert friend to take shopping with you. The author tells you which fish are best for beginners, what fish shouldn't even be sold, what qualities a dealer should have, what equipment you should buy, what equipment is a waste of your money, what products are dangerous, what plants are no good but are sold for aquariums anyway, etc. I finally found answers to a lot of questions that other books didn't cover. The book discusses cleaning schedules, necessary floor strength, and moving concerns. It explains water chemistry as simply as possible. There is list of the author's favorite aquarium books and other info sources. He even tells you how you can reach him.The reasons why I didn't give this book 5 stars are trivial: Hard to make out black + white photos and substandard proofreading. Still, everyone who has or wants an aquarium needs this book."
2,Cramps - 5 Stars This DVD - 2 Stars,"While enjoyable, you need to know that the running time of the Cramps performance here is 20 MINUTES. You won't see this on the box as I'm sure it would detract from sales. The Cramps performance was enjoyable as always, and the setting could hardly be more appropriate. The sound and video footage are VERY ROUGH. I'd like to see a better produced feature-length Cramps concert myself though."
3,Rare Cramps,"Raw, primitive footage of early Cramps live! They are performing before mental patients, and at times, they look a little nervous. The audience seemed to enjoy themselves, and had no problem grabbing the microphone and joining the act! Thought I was watching a real life Marat/Sade here.Video and sound are bad however. You have to see this as ""archival"" footage. An interesting watch for fans. Disk also includes previews of other video products the company sells. Underground and punk groups you may not even heard of."
4,Tasted great but not a lot on the plate,"Like others have said considering the date & what this was shot with the quality is pretty darn good. Show was great but I gave this 4 stars due to the length. We get 8 songs that equal about 20 -25 mins of footage here with only some small sample clips from other Target Video shows, I'd have liked a little more content. Still a great pick up dvd for fans."
3,"Great band, horrible quality","Of course, The Cramps are one of the greatest bands ever. They are also one of the best bands to see live. This DVD certainly captures a good performance by them, but the quality is so horrific that only diehard fans will find the need to see it. Casual fans and beginners can just take their money and pick up ""Songs the Lord Taught Us"". A good amount of classic Cramps songs are here, such as ""Human Fly"" and ""Garbage Man"", making this okay for a rental.One other audience that may be interested in viewing this are fans of bizarre and obscure cinema. This is certainly a surreal experiance to watch. This is a DVD with limited appeal."
5,There Are No Soulmates,"This book is so wonderful I encourage everyone and anyone to read it. Especially if you are at a point in your life where you are looking for that someone to ""complete"" your life. It will put things into perspective for you and you will realize that it is not the end of the world if you do not find that someone and that you don't need to get married to live a fulfilling life. You will begin to focus on yourself which is the most important thing of all."
5,Love,It would have been impossible no to have enjoyed a Poirot movie. I am glad when I want to see it I can
5,i love it,"Great show, can watch it again and again. The entire series is great. I would highly recommend it. Thanks Amazon."
5,Hercule Poirot does it Again!,"I have always enjoyed Agatha Christie's Mysteries. Hercule Poirot happens to be one of my all-time favorite. I am a big fan of British Cinema, I have always been thanks to my mother's superb taste in quality television. I share my purchase with both my mother and sister. We've enjoyed them all. Thank you for providing such a wide-selection. Happy in California, USA!"
5,Good price,I have no complaints whatsoever. The DVD was exactly as expected for a really good price and arrived on time.
5,ac fan,I will love poirot always. David Suchet is the best. Please add more seasons to prime as well as miss marple also.
5,"Balanced, kind, affective parenting","I really like this book, just as I like ""The Many Loves of Marriage"" (see my review on that one). I don't know what went wrong in his life that made him leave his wife for booze and a sleazy woman (and other very bizarre behaviors), but before all that happened, he seemed like a very honest, kind, gentle family man. You can't go wrong reading this book or the other one if you can overlook his mid-life crisis and later lifestyle (which contributed to his early death). I am so sorry for Nannette and the daughters for all the grief he caused them, and for the grief he caused gallery owners, but if you can pretend you don't know what transpired with Kinkade, this book is such a nice read.I hope you can practice what he preached better than he himself did."
3,You can do better,"If you want to buy Yugioh cards, you probobaly should stay away from these. Legend of Blue-Eyes was the first set, but the cards kinda suck. For the die-hard duelist, the promise of perhaps getting a raigeki or blue-eyes white dragon may be tantalizing, but the chances are not very good. My expierience with these is that you often get sub-par rares (Celtic Gaurdian, Gravedigger Ghoul) and just downright ... commons. If you are looking for firepower for a deck, look elsewhere. If you are a collector, and don't care if you're cards could get the tar beat out of them by freakin Feril Imp, then go ahead and buy these.Parents, I know 99% of you didn't understand a word of what I said above, so I'll lay it out for you too. If your child plays the yugioh game they will be more satisfied with any other booster (Metal Raiders, Magic Ruler, and so on and so forth). If your child is simply a collector, they might be perfectly happy with these."
4,"Legend of Blue Eyes, not the best of the best","Mostly, you wont get a good card. The only ones that are rare and good are Blue Eyes, Red Eyes, and all 5 peices of Exodia. Although you can get into classics sence it is the first booster. It will give you a boost in your deck. Also, this is one of the few that have Exodia. But I also suggest you buy deck protectors besause of natural disasters that will damage your cards and a deck box to hold it."
3,Its... OK,These cards are pretty good. You can get ones like blue eyes and exodia but i would reccomend Pharo's servant. Although its slightly more expensive it has rarer cards like buster blader and jinzo.
5,A MUST,"Tape can be so expensive, and those little dispensers are a pain. These are great because they are heavy so you can use one hand, and it's a whole lot cheaper to go to an office store and buy a stack of refill tape. A package of 6 usually lasts me 2 years at home."
4,Functional,These dispensers are among the workhorses of my home. It was nice to pick up another one at a good price.
5,Heavy Duty,Don't be fooled by the great price! This weighs as much as your standard high dollar dispenser and it works great! As well it looks very professional too! I recommend getting this item!
4,a national treasure,"President Theodore Roosevelt brought many national treasures to light. His campaign to preserve the country's natural landmarks is well known. Our debt to Roosevelt is even greater still. If not for the president's interest, Edwin Arlington Robinson would likely have languished in obscurity.This volume of poetry shows Robinson to be one of America's greatest poets. Robinson is unbelievably talented. He ranks amount the greatest sonneteers the country has ever seen. His longer poems, like ""Isaac and Archibald,"" are stunning.Visceral emotion and intellectual innovation collide and transform the words of Robinson's poetry into something greater than the sum of its parts. This is great stuff. This is what poetry should be.I recommend it highly."
4,Mr.Flood's Party For One,"Upon reading Robinson's poem Mr. Flood's Party, we found yet another pathetic character relying on unconventional mechanisims to ease the pain. Like Richard Corey, Mr. Eben Flood is hollow inside, an outsider to the world around him. In Robinson's poem, we find him atop a hill while drowning himself in the mixtures of alcohol. There's a sense of dark humor in Eben saying, ""Drink to the bird."" ""He raised up to the light the jug that he had gone so far to fill,"" This displays the mere fact that the man is in solitude and desperately trying to humor himself in order to fill the void within his existance. We feel that this poem is well written because of the use of dialogue to heighten the interest. The symbolism of opening and shutting doors parallels with the life of Eben Flood and the friends and opportunities he has lost along the way. The techniques of the inconsistant rhyme scheme that Robinson uses craft the demeanor of a drunk."
3,AND the kitchen sink....,"That the Brontes were talented and have left an enduring legacy to the world of lituature is an unchallenged fact. That this book is the most exhaustive study of that family to date will probably also be undisputed. For anyone who has ever wanted to aquaint themselves with every cobblestone trod upon, every house lived in or visited, every sermon attended, every note written, every dress sewn - THIS is the book for you. In a book of 1000+ pages, the years in which the great Bronte lituature was produced is covered in a mere 125+ pages. Almost a footnote in a body of work of this size. Slightly less perhaps would have left us with much more"
5,"Well constructed, moving","I finished this last week and really enjoyed it. It is a very absorbing biography of the Bronte family through their letters. Charlotte Bronte's life was just as dramatic as her novels, and in fact formed the basis for them. The epistolary format works very well, and allows a more personal view into their lives than a regular biography can. The focus is mostly on Charlotte as Anne and Emily didn't correspond with many people."
