1,Terrible remake,"The acting, storyline variation and overall look and feel of the movie is an insult to the original with Toby and Kirstin. The whole story builds up to a total of a few minutes on screen action of lizard man and that's it - a terrible terrible remake that Martin Sheen should even be ashamed of starring in."
2,"Worth renting, but not buying","Disappointed with this movie. Original was much better. It is OK to rent, but I would not buy it again."
4,Better Than I Expected,"Starts slow but picks up real quick. At first, I wasn't very thrilled to see Andrew Garfield (The Social Network) casted as Spiderman but I thought he did a great job. His performance and portraying of emotions were superb. Emma Stone (The Help) was very convincing and a sweetheart. She was able to convey the innocent but mischievous girlfriend brilliantly. Great cinematography, film direction (Mark Webb) and film editing. Storyline was not original though. A superhero motivated by revenge at first and able to bottle up his personal feelings later on with a villain starting as a good scientist who gets carried away by ambition. Some fundamental but small changes on the original character that may be hard to swallow by hardcore fans. Highly recommended."
4,On the wall !,"On time and fits all the others, except Tobi and Krist. were not there,, but a good movie ! GET IT TODAY!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"Good, not great","Good cast and reasonable telling of the origin story. Goes back to Peter being more of an inventor and creating his own web shooters, but the movie spent so little time on it that it didn't really convey how good of an inventor Peter is or capture the idea that he has to worry about running out of webs or using different cartridges for different types of webs as some of the comics sometimes did. I didn't understand the point of switching to those being an invention if they weren't going to go into some of the disadvantages/advantages of that difference.All in all, good if you like comic book movies, but nothing special even in that genre and not something I'd recommend for non-comic book fans."
3,Back to the beginning,"We ALL know how Peter Parker turns into Spiderman. Please stop making movies on re-telling everyone from the beginning! The one thing i didn't know was how much Peter Parker was an ""Emo"". I like the ""nerdy"" Peter Parker so much better. Some acting was better than others but overall it was O.K."
2,Kinda boring.. and very very slow,Nobody needs to keep redoing the Spider Man Origin story.... let it go and let's just go on from where the last movie stopped.
3,Meh,"Fun, but really not the bomb diggity. The special effects were cool but the story diverted a bit from the comic."
3,Disappointing,"This version of Spider Man was such a sharp twist on the comic book that i ccould not except it. On top of that some of the stunts were not that impressive. I think it was a waste of money. The only reason i gave it three stars was because of good camera work and it was loaded with great actors, excluding Peter Parker, who was given a bad script"
3,Ambitious reboot,This reboot tries to stay true to the original story but falls short in delivering the story. I wished they had spent more time on the details
4,Good time pass,Entertaining. Definitely worth a watch. Often it's difficult to sustain interest when you are recreating an existing franchise with a new spin. This movie does not suffer from this problem.
5,Spider-Man!,If you love Spider-Man you should buy this movie and if you already own it on DVD then buy it again anyways.
2,Spits in the face of Lee-Ditko-Romita Spidey fans,"I got my first Spider-Man comic in 1964, so you could say I've been a fan of 'ol Webhead for a few years now. This near-abomination of a film is an insult to Spidey's golden age. Fighting with crabby Uncle Ben and Aunt May? Hipster skater boi Peter Parker? Curt Connors just as much a villain as The Lizard? Spidey and Lizard origins connected? No J. Jonah Jameson? I was so aggravated by this film that my wife was afraid that children sitting nearby would hear my vulgar muttering.The only thing that kept this movie from one-star oblivion was Emma Stone and Denis Leary, both of whom were better than the material.The new costume design is beyond horrendous. Steve Ditko's Spidey costume design cannot be improved upon, so why try?Sam Raimi's SM2 remains the quintessential Spidey film."
4,"I was skeptical, but pleasantly surprised.","I went into this film as a skeptic, as I thought Sam Raimi's take (most of it, anyway) was pretty brilliant. I thought this would be too much emo and not enough superhero, but I was surprised to find it chock full of the latter and none of the former. Andrew Garfield is spot-on in this role, and he and the other case carry it to greatness. It's no Avengers, but it doesn't try to be--this is just a flat-out good solitary-superhero movie that opens the door to a more modern Spiderman mythos. The characters are very likable, the action is fun (again, nothing epic like Avengers), and it's got plenty of comedy that fits. This is a great start for a potentially amazing trilogy."
4,A better spiderman.,I love Sam Raimi but I wish he had not tried to make Spiderman movies. This reboot might have seemed like it was too soon but it was just what the franchise needed.
3,Not as good as the first series,"The first Spider Man movie was a classic. This Spider Man movie has great actors, but the story didn't bring anything fresh or exciting to the genre. If it ain't broke, don't try to fix it."
2,Lame,"Good CGI, acceptable characters, below average acting, poor storyline, why do the producers keep doing origin stories. Interesting twist on parents but cliffhanger. Batman finally got it right with a darker story, superman failed, spiderman -pay attention."
2,My Review for the Amazing Spiderman,"This movie was so boring that it had my friends and I yawning. It dragged. I also have to disagree with some of the reviews that praise the new Spiderman actor. Tobey was way better and believable. Although, Emma Stone did an amazing job with her character. She stole the spotlight. Dennis Leary also did a great job. The movie was slow to start, remained slow, and had a weak finish."
2,So very bad.,"The worst comic book movie I have ever seen. Terrible actors, stupid dialogue, bad special effects, need I go on? So sad this character has not made it back to Marvel, they might do it justice. Was there anybody in this movie that didn't see spider man without his mask? When it's time for spider man, keep the fricking mask on, who cares about the actor. I nearly didn't finish this movie, I just hated everything about it. The scrawny little kid playing him was annoying as hell. Move off of the kids story and put a man in spider man for a change. Just so bad."
4,"Well made, but short on plot.","I felt like more emphasis was made to jam as much action in with a little back story than on plot. Clearly foreshadowed another movie, but still a good relaunch of the series."
4,"Spidey,,, My Favorite","I've always considered Spider-Man a different super hero than the others. He is constantly dealing with his spider and human subconscious trying to figure out a way to satisfy both and the situation he's in it. I'd say Spider-Man's stories are a higher level of drama than all other comic characters, and that's what make me come for more."
5,Best Spiderman yet,"This is the movie that all the spiderman fans were waiting for. It explores even more of the back story to Peter Parker and has a far more ""real"" feel to it than any of the other Spiderman movies."
5,The Amazing Spider-Man (Four-Disc Combo: Blu-ray 3D/Blu-ray/DVD + UltraViolet Digital Copy),"It was a very good movie and I loved the action. I thought that it could have used a little more action and less love stuff, but overall it is a very good movie. I just can't wait until the 3D comes out. I also hope he will be in The Avengers sequel, also I can't wait for the sequel for the movie. Also the collectors edition is cool the figures are about 6 inches high each. It also comes with more special features.P.S. Ultra Violet works It can only stream to idevices (ipad, iphone) or droid devices it is O.K."
1,Again,Feel like I saw this movie 5 years ago. And turns out I did. Certainly not worth seeing unless you hated Toby in first go around.
3,The fans deserve better,the acting is horrible. they could have done so much with this character and chose a safe way out little to no imagination.
4,Great New Version of Spidy,The new actor and new story line are a good new version of original. I like the actors and special effects. Worth the rental.
4,Good movie at incredible price (Black Friday),"This was a great purchase at 10 bucks on BF. I don't care about the fact this is a reboot or not, this is a good movie for the whole family. I still love the originals, but this one really is not missing anything. I also LOVE the fact that it comes with UltraViolet Digital Copy, I can download the movie to my smartphone and take with me on plane."
5,Awesome,The new Spider-Man is awesome! It was sad that there were new actors but the story line was much better.
1,One of the worst English language movies I've ever seen,"A cheap imitation of the original Spider-man movies. The writing was done by high-school film class drop-outs, the acting and directing by drama club rejects. Not one move made, nor word uttered by the characters, was unexpected or interesting. Sally Field and Martin Sheen showed themselves to be third rate actors as the aunt and uncle; they were no match whatsoever to the actors who played these likable characters in the original movie. The actors who played Spider-man and Mary-Jane were equally unsympathetic; there was no chemistry between these characters at all. None of the characters were developed, none of their actions were unpredictable, and none of the writing didn't make me gag as I listened to the lines being spoken. Buy the original, instead, if you haven't already."
1,Confused,It appears that the producer just decided to redo the first movie. I grew bored rather quickly and didn't wish to waste my time on it so I quit watching after the uncle was killed.
1,Don't Bother,"After watching this ""reboot,"" I concluded that it was an unnecessary movie, and that it was complete waste of my time and money."
1,Amazing Spiderman stinks period,this movie was terrible. Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker was flat out terrible. The special effects in this move where uninspired. I'm normally a sucker for all things Marvel and DC but this piece of garbage was nothing more then attempted money grab. Please end this series now and recast. Note to Marc Web: you suck as a film director.
2,A Remake That Needs To Be Remade,Too much conversation and not enough action. I usually like most effort put into a movie that gives background to the characters. This was too much to get to the point.Without telling the movie. I miss Mary J. I loved the other Spiderman movies with Tobey Maguire. This should have not been a beginning but a continuation. And did I say I missed Mary J? Stick to the actor that worked.I'm done. I am starting to get angry typing this review. What a gigantic waste of money...
2,Sorry,"This for me was an unnecessary retelling and remake of the 2002 version. The 3d is underwhelming and the movie is colorless. The Spider-man suit has now been darkened as Superman's was in ""Superman Returns"" and the upcoming 2013 Superman (which is actually darker), making the overall movie dull.The Batman reboot was supposed to be dark; he was a dark character, but Superman and Spider-man should be portrayed as bright lights in a dark world.Maybe if it was made as another Spider-man episode, and not a remake of a movie just out in 2002, I might have felt differently."
2,disappointing,"Why a reboot? Only five minutes were amazing. Don't bother if you ever saw the first Spiderman which is miles better than this. And since most of the movie was talking so why did they shoot it in 3D? It is just a way to raise ticket price, I'd be happy to pay more if the movie was better but that is not the case here. I'd watch the first Spiderman again."
3,really,"I am so happy i did not go and see this movie when it came out this yea, it was not even worth the 3>99 i spent to watch it."
3,it's ok: a kid's review,when I saw the original spider-man movies I enjoyed them After watching I could say that they were great movies but sadly this one just didn't impress me but even if you ignore the originals it still is not to great because it just didn't live up to the hype at all but it's an okay movie but they should have tried doing a bit better but I will try watching this a second time
3,Nice movie but won't buy because of Ultraviolate,The movie was ok. It wasn't the knock your socks off spiderman expereince that I expected. But a nice pop corn flick none-the-less. I would pre-order this if the digital copy was for Itunes and not Ultraviolate. Ultraviolate is a deal killer. The service is clumbsy at best and customer service is even worse. Please please please create a bundle with Itunes support. Until then I'll wait until Netflix has this movie for rent.
2,Annoyed I bought this for $14.99,Weak dialogue and a goofy green Barney type reptile that talks. Just an all around cheesy remake with some good action scenes and really weak writing.
2,Nothing Amazing about this Reboot,"Did I see a different movie than everybody else? Yes the third Spiderman was actrocious, but it was at least a little more coherent than this. Yes Garfield was a good Parker/Spiderman and the effects were good. But that's it! The plot was all over the place,the costume sucked, and character development for the villians was non-existent. Also the new ""reboot"" barely followed the source material. And worst of all the lesson of Spider-Man wasn't even mentioned ""WIth great powers comes great respondsibility."" Please bring back Raimi until then make mine DC. Nuff said."
1,This movie is unwatchable.,"I don't understand. This movie is unwatchable. The acting is bad, horrible pacing, most of the special effects are sub par. I don't understand why the rating is so high."
1,boring !!,"this movie was really boring and awful that i even wanted to leave the theater before the end of the movie, i like the other ones better !!"
1,awful,"A third of the movie is a mediocre remake of the 1st Spiderman movie. Another third of the movie was a bad teenage soap opera. The few action scenes were cliche and predictable. The Lizardman looked cheesy as hell. I didn't see much humor and fun in the film like I did in Sam Rami's Spidey movies. It was boring,"
1,Terrible,"Toby McGuire was a way better spider man. This guy is good but definitely not spider man worthy. The over all movie was not even remotely as good as any of the previous spider movies. I felt it to be boring, shallow, and very cheesy. This movie will definitely not join my DVD collection and I will pretend that this film was never made. Terrible glitch in the spider man series and hope that it never goes back in that direction. Toby McGuire didn't take this role because the script was poorly written and he was smart not to. Watching this movie is disappointing, don't waste your time."
1,limited access,I use to watch my purchased videos with my android phone. Now amazon has blocked my device from viewing or purchasing for that matter. I guess they would rather I purchase from another provider. And I will. Your long time customer is now gone.
4,This movie was entertaining.,I enjoyed this movie. It was entertaining and I liked it better than the previous telling of the same story. Nicely done...
2,Spidey has been done to death,"I have totally lost count of all the Amazing Spiderman remakes, it was only good the first few times. Now I think comic books were actually better. Let's get some black flag and end his suffering..."
4,Great Fun,"Better than the other Spiderman films for pure entertainment. Action and dialouge wer well thought out, Natural in most moments."
4,Better than I expected,I was a big fan of the original with Toby Mcguire so I was suspect of the reboot. I was pleaseantly surprised with the film. Very entertaining and the cast was very good. Both the new Spidy (Andrew Garfield) and Mary Jane characters did a great job. I highly recommend this film for any Spiderman fans or anyone looking for a good entertaining action movie.
3,Not as good as the last version,"I thought in some instances, this version held more true to form with regard to the original i.e. Gwen Stacy but to completely leave out the Daily Bugle was a problem for me."
2,The worst sequel of Spider-man,The movie lost its soul. The story line isn't great and lacks of character. The main actor also didn't perform well. This is the worst Spider-Man.
4,Great Film ! Definately worth the ticket price !!!!,I admit that the re-boot was a little out of sorts & I'm not a fan of them either but this film was better than most critics given it credit for. Everybody harps on the fact that the graphics for the lizard could've been better but what more do you expect ??????????? It was a good design for the caliber of movie that it is. I will definately recommend this for anyone that has not gotten a chance to experience this movie first hand.
4,The Amazing Spider-Man,"Interesting spin on the web slinger,liked the actors.More like the book in some ways.Hope to see more by these guys."
4,Luv it,Great movie not much more to say. This is why I don't review things here often too many words necessary
5,Great film,"I didn't think they needed to reboot the series. Then I saw the film and realized how bogged down the Tobey Maguire series was with Peter being too old and to into trying to make a life. Watching this was a lot of fun because I think everyone can relate to the struggles of high school. They made Peter more of a loner than a nerd. He is still the smart science kid, but that isn't so nerdy in today's world. Making him the lonely high school kid was a good move. And the actors in this film are well cast and wonderful."
4,a little fun for its own sake,"Certainly a cut above the 2002 version with Tobey Maguire, who missed his (webbed) shot even with ten-year-old viewers. This one should satisfy adults who can tolerate fun for its own sake, the occasional cornball touches, and faint derivatives of Superman and King Kong."
2,Boring,The special effects were pretty good.The acting was boring. The story was dumb. The main evil character was laughable.
5,amazing spider man,This movie is so good. I have enjoyed the other spider man movies and was concerned if I would enjoy this one as much. I really liked this movie.
3,so so,did like it myself but was split in house hold 3 to3 about how it was boring the first hour i thought
4,Great Start,"I'm going to get to the point. Many people disliked the fact that they were starting the Spider-Man films all over again. You know what I say? Who cares!! The old Spider-Man movies will always be there. Just give the new movie a chance. If you don't like it, fine, don't hold a grudge, move on.Okay as for the review of the movie, I thought it was great. Andrew Garfield really sells the role of a teenager in high school struggling with his new ability and love. There were a few scenes in the movie that I could have done without. They were the ones that tried to be funny, but really were just cheesy. Other than that, the movie was good. I wish there would have been more action towards the climax. It's probably the trailer's fault as to why I feel so dissapointed haha. It wasn't as great as I hoped it would be, but it was enjoyable."
1,Wish I could rate this product,Well as you see I rated this item 1 out of 5 stars. Thats only because I never recieved the product. The seller never got back to me and ended up getting a refund from amazon. Would never buy from this seller again.
2,I Fell Asleep,Eh. It wasn't horrible. There was some good snark and I really enjoy Emma Stone. She has great comedic timing. But there wasn't much that set this film apart from the others in the genre.
3,They could've waited,"It's so, so. Not as good as the first series of Spider Man movies. They could've waited before they redid spidey again."
3,Wasn't 'amazing',This is a worthy reboot/follow up to Sam Raimi's trilogy in that it served to keep this tent pole franchise with Sony. We have to retell the origin story to get Emma Stone and an appearance by fan favorite villian--the Lizard. Fair enough. It was an enjoyable movie; the kids ate it up and I'm looking forward to seeing Jamie Fox as Electro in the next one. Just too bad Marvel wouldn't trust Raimi to his vision. I'd put Spider-man 1 and 2 right up there with the first two Superman movies as far as story andcharacter development are concerned. I just bemoan not getting Ben Kingsley as The Vulture... THAT would've been AMAZING.
4,self,I bought this movie because I like the spiderman movies. It turned out to be good. All spiderman movies are good.
4,Pretty good..,worth the time and moneyoh 15 words required? need to say something else. 4 stars and um i'm out
4,Enjoyable Spider-Man,I definitely enjoyed Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man and Emma Stone was a good fit for his romantic interest. It was much less campy for a super hero movie and I thought the action scenes were well done.
4,different perspective of Spiderman,This movie showed a different perspective of the beginning of Spiderman than what was shown with actor Toby Mcguire. good movie.
1,Definitely for the younger audience,"After the many positive reviews I'd read about this movie I convinced myself to buy it and see for myself. Boy was I disappointed! I think I read a review somewhere on here that compared it to a ""Twilight"" version of Spiderman. Couldn't have put it better! I'm in my mid 30's and I would have been embarrassed to watch this with any of my family or friends it was so emo. Definitley a movie for the teenage audience. I did like the lizard character and spiderman's costume but that's about it."
2,1st ones were better,Parker wasn't nerder enough. He reminded me of danny from grease. Toby Mcguire was way better. If you hadn't watched the other movies you may like this one. It was ok
1,Ultra violet Copy a JOKE!,Do NOT Buy this DVD. The Ultra Violet Digital Copy is a horrible set up. Do not buy these products as longs as they keep doing this. Maybe after they realize that people are taking their business else where they will actually include a real digital copy.
5,Great,Fresh new take on the classic story. Very well done with a balance of realism and super hero fantasy. Enjoy!
3,Fun show,The story has some of the same things as the other movies. it was still a lot of fun. A must watch
5,Fun family movie,Fun family movie. This movie almost make you believe in Super Heroes all over again. This Spider could really be the guy next door. Who knows?
1,"Why, why, why?????","Save your time and rent the first Spiderman movie with Toby McGuire. This was a movie that did not need to be made. To make it worse, it is BORING. We rented it out of RedBox (glad I didn't buy it). We got about 30 minutes into it and turned it off. The change of the Spiderman story is not even good.Toby paid a good, nerdy Peter Parker. This guy is NOT EVEN CLOSE. It is s waste of time."
4,The Amazing Spiderman,I do like where they corrected some discrepancies of the character. Being bitten made him be able to produce webbing? It would have not then be coming out of his wrists but the posterior region instead.
5,walmart purchase,"my son got this movie at walmart for christmas. the blu-ray, dvd all work perfectly and its a great movie. I've not tried the digital copy though. I'll update this after doing so later."
5,A review,This movie was thoroughly entertaining and extremely satisfying. It can easily be described as the best movie of the entire Spiderman franchise. Tobey Maguire did a very good job in the Spiderman trilogy but Andrew Garfield has dominated the role of Peter Parker. Andrew and Emma work and fit effortlessly together. Cannot wait for the next installment. One of the top movies of this 2012. This movie IS the summers MUST SEE movie. Nothing but glowing praise.
2,The Amazing Spiderman,Im sorry but this reboot needs a reboot i have no idea why he kept taking off his mask in the movie and some of the action seemed like it came from the 1st spiderman movie and the lizard man looked bad.It just did not work for me so this dvd i will be skipping and getting the avengers way better movie
1,"54 minutes of nothing, followed by 18 minutes of nothing","Amazingly, 54 minutes of nothing, followed by 18 minutes of nothing - 2/3 the entire movie. How did they accomplish so much of nothing? Finally, at 1:28 into the movie, we see Spider-man in his spidey suit; yes, 1 and a half hours from the start of the movie. There's a couple fight scenes, the first being one minute long. Then the end, a nothingness which takes up another 20 minutes of the movie. Then the credits which take up the rest of the movie.This is a huge rip-off; utter nothingness, not even sufficient eye candy. The actor (who-ever) is unable to sustain a leading role - my plant has more charisma.Boycott these types of movies by not paying for them. I wasted $15 so you don't have to. You should pay me $1 for this review so that you can save money by not buying the movie."
4,Different!,"Spider-Man was a good movie, good picture, and storyline. But it was different from the one released ten years ago and hard to get used to."
3,Still unsure,I'm still unsure about this one. I'm starting to think that the whole Spider-Man thing is played out. I'm never a fan of re-making a movie when it was just re-made. I know the story line was different but I have a hard time separating the new guy from the last guy. I don't know. It was okay.
3,remake of the remake,"Found this movie to be okay in the middle, but how many times can the movie be re-made. The story line was completely different than the Spiderman movie and the comics."
2,This movie did stink,The story was horrible. The other Spider-Man movies were better except for number 3. I did not like this movie at all
3,Case/cover damaged prior to shipment,"I received my copy of Spider-man today. Shipping was super fast BUT, when I opened it, the case had been cut with some kind of box cutter / razor blade damaging the plastic cover AND the artwork under the plastic. The cut did not penetrate thru the case so the BD & DVD were not damaged. The damage was obviously done prior to shipping because the mailer it came in was not damaged. I just wanted to inform you that my product was received in a damaged condition but I paid for a new, undamaged product. Someone needs to be more careful with their razor blades. Thank you."
3,Spiderman overplayed,"I am not sure how to take this movie. I guess it is to introduce spidey into the Avengers Universe. Otherwise, why would they risk rebooting so soon?"
3,This movie was ok,To me not many of the newer action movies have been worth the rental or purchase price so I am going to wait to see them on Starz first before I buy or rent them.
3,Its Okay,"I remember reading this story in a comic book along time ago. It all came back to me as I watched this movie for the first time. I truly believe that the release of this movie was too close to the Trilogy Spiderman Franchise. Having said that I liked the movie but the CGI is taking over the world. Alternate realities are one thing but constant alternate realities in movies is making my behind tired. The Spiderman character was okay, he lacks depth as did every actor they propped up for The Amazing Spiderman. Oh, and by the way how many times do we need to see Stan Lee? I mean seriously folks. Wassup with this stuff!! The Lizard OMG, that was funny. So to Marvel I say This ""Cmon Man""."
3,Good Origin,"I am a huge Spiderman fan and thoroughly enjoyed this movie from that aspect. I thought they did an amazing job with the cast (probably the best part), story, and directing.The two reasons I could not give this 4 or even 5 stars was 1.) It was WAY to dark. The majority of the movie is at night with very few daytime scenes. This makes things difficult to follow. This also helps the CGI crew make terrible graphics since you won't notice. Good way to cut budget, but it takes a lot away from the movie and spiderman's story. 2.) I do not enjoy first person scenes. Unfortunately, I get sick/dizzy from it. Not a big issue, but still important. I wish directors would stop thinking that it is artistic. Its not."
2,NOT HD,I have more than enough bandwidth and still I had to watch this in SD. I watch a lot of Netflix (in HD) so I was shocked it was in HD even though I payed for HD. The movie was pretty good.
3,Not amazed?,Probably much like others disappointed in the storyline switch up which was supported by Stan Lee because of course he's in it. But if you had no prior knowledge of the web-slinger it was a great movie and 3d at home is awesome.
3,Amazing Spider Man,"Wasnt too amazing, would not see it again. Same old same old movie, nothing new at all to be amazing."
4,great spider man movie,good movie good price you cant go wrong buy this movie it goes great with other spiderman movies worth the watch
3,okay... the spider was okay.,"okay the reboot was seriously needed, really. they missed up spiderman 2 and 3, i mean how can they interduce eddie brook in part 2, then in 3 he is a new charater in the bugle, a complete mess of things.... but back to the amazing some parts in the movie did leave me sketching my head. really did. some of peter park's behavior was questionable. the humor was great in the most part, new tecniques was shown on spiderman behalf. but for me the movie was in between, that's why i give it a 3 star."
3,Don't want Ultra violet,What happen to the standard Digital version. I hate the cloud!!!!! I may not buy this since I usually watch on my PC vs Blue ray and 52 inch like the digital flexibility
3,Enjoyable and Wrong,"Well I went into this with an open mind to see if Webb could direct a superhero film and I have to say it's a hit and miss. The reason is because I'm a die hard fan of Sam Raimi and have been since the evil dead days.The other reason is I wanted to give it a chance, to me it was exciting and boring.Several people have pointed out that the main actor kept on taking off the mask.Hello, It's a spiderman film not show my face sort of film. The mask needs to stay on, the Lizard was off and he never looked like that. It looked like one of those lizards from the D&D; books.Normally I hate remakes and I also hate it when directors and writers don't do the research to keep true to the comic's.It is worth the buy and I can over look some of the details but I just don't think Webb gets it. He might be very good at some of his other films however I personally think that he needs to stay away from superhero films."
5,Far better than Toby,"best spider-man yet. Garfield nails the roles of both Peter and Spider-man and I never thought anyone would play a better Pater Parker after Tobey Maguire's version. Also, the effects on the lizard are awesome."
2,Boooring,"I watched this last night with high hopes. I'm not going to get into a long review, suffice to say that my hopes were dashed to smithereens. I almost stopped watching a couple of times because I was so bored. It seemed that this reboot was made with ""Twilight"" in mind. It was so annoying. Peter Parker was a whinny brat and the Lizard was lame! Only good thing going for this movie was Emma Stone. Some people think the sequel will be much better. Meh, I they make it, I hope so."
2,Disappointing reboot,"I didn't like Peter Parker in this version. He was moody, vain, insensitive, and childish. The reason why Spider-man is a hero, is not due to his powers, but the character of Peter Parker. Peter Parker always attempted to do the right thing even when life told him it was far easier to do it the wrong way. He didn't accept stolen goods. He didn't use his powers to pick up women or belittle others. He didn't lash out at the people he loved. So, who really cares at the end of this movie if he lives or dies? I didn't."
2,A step down,"This movie is clearly a step down from the Sam Raimi Spider-man trilogy. I would give the movie itself 3 stars, but I am deducting a point for the malware* ridden DRM that has been attached to the product.*Even though I have no specific evidence that this software contains malware, Sony has done this in the past, so I am not even going to attempt to install it. The website happily accepted my personal information (email address, birthday, etc.), but wouldn't let me download the movie for offline viewing unless I installed their downloader."
3,Good movie BAD 3D !!!!!,This is a good movie but the 3d efects suck if you can whatch this with out the gasses then it's not true 3d booo...
4,good movie,the amazing spider man is based on the comics . not mismisleading or anything else; i loved this movie and the 1st person view
3,So so,"Why the sudden reboot?I thought Tobey Maguire was a better actor and a better Spider-man. Spider-man is a nerd. It looked like they took this buy out of some vampire movie. The CGI/special effects were good, but as always CGI does not simply make a good movie. Acting and story line do. This was just a simple reboot of a movie made 10 years ago. Just another way for the movie industry to try and make money.It is a time waster so rentable, but not buyable."
1,Just not Spider-man without MJ!,"A new look at the origins of Spider-man, or so the summary of this movie claimed.I felt the pacing of this movie to be slow, and it seemed to me that the storyline was borrowed fromSpider-Manwith a few ideas borrowed fromSpider-Man 2. The scene in the movie where Uncle Ben is murdered, I felt that was taken directly from the first Spider-man movie that Tobey Maguire did. And the villian being misguided reminded me of Doc Ock in Spider-man 2.My other big issue with the movie was that I am so used to Peter Parker's girlfriend is Mary Jane, but in the movie, they had her be a girl named Gwen.While I can appreciate that the makers of the film were trying to do something new and fresh with the storyline, I just don't think it worked with this film."
2,not good at all,i liked the other spider-man series. The lizard looked fake and didn't like the new guy playing spidey either in this new story.
2,Waste of time,This movie was slow and predictable. The characters were one-dimensional. The lizard man was laughable. The special effects were contrived and fake. A complete waste of two hours and three dollars.
2,Lousy,"In my humble opinion, this latest of the Spider-man movies was terrible. The acting was poor at best and the story itself was mundane. This is one of those franchise movies they should have left alone."
3,Another introduction,"This is another origin movie. Everytime Hollywood decides to make another movie based on a comic book hero they start with the origin of the character. There have been a number of Spider-Man movies, even though ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" has new actors do we have to see another introduction to these characters. Hollywood : On the next comic book based movie just jump into a good story line and skip the origin."
5,It was what I expected. Awesome.,"Great special effects. Great plot. Good acting. Everything you expect from a big Hollywood remake. Emma Stone was fun as always, I really liked her in this role."
4,Great Re-boot,This actor came across as a better Peter Parker than Maguire in the previous films. He seemed more believeable as a teenager who was invisible for most of his life.
2,Could have done without another remake,"I was just as disappointed with this remake as I was with the Tobey Maguire versions. To sum up, it was ""meh""."
3,First One Was Better,"The first Spiderman that came out in my opinion was a better movie, better story line and mor elike the comic book"
4,good movie,this version of spiderman was just as good it has a lot of action loved it makes a great gift
3,Entertaining at most,"It was entertaining. It did not revolutionize anything. It looks like Hollywood is running out of move ideas.Anyways, the movie had a good premise. The character development was unique, wasn't how most portray Peter Parker. I see the direction they were trying to go for. They wanted to make it more dark and gritty, felt like it kinda backfired because they really didn't build up to anything with it.The CG with the Lizard was pretty bad. It wasn't bad that it looked amateurish, but for a major motion picture, I expected a much more realistic Lizard."
5,I love this movie!,"My whole family really enjoyed the Amazing Spider-Man.I like the story, and the actors in this movie as well."
2,The Amazing Spider-Man,this movie was okay. I just wanted the original spider man to be spider man. This actor (in my recollection) is a comedian. the movie itself was okay.
1,No,"Something got missed with this film. I love Spiderman but this movie sucked,sucked,sucked. Try watching this and then watching the lastest Batman."
4,Great,"Perfect reboot and more true to the comics. Surprisingly funny, and lots of action. Liked it more than the original and was less theatrical."
5,Best spiderman movie,The movie was great and my family and i loved it! It was the most closely related spiderman movie to the comics!
3,okay movie,"Well not as well done as the first series of spiderman movies this was not half bad. If you never saw the first three movies this reboot is worth watching. Although Toby Mcguire was a way better Peter Parker then the young man in this movie I prefer the Gwen Stacy character in this movie to that of Mary Jane Watson in the original. But for the love of god, why do they insist on removing the mask of the superhero ever five minutes, just saying. Anyway good rental, but not a buy."
3,Not Spider-Man,Spider- Man is not a skateboarding Emo.Uncle Ben never gives his famous speech and they made Pete into a bully and a lier.
3,Standard Comic Book Movie,"Pretty much what you would expect: standard ""spider-man"" storyline, standard comic book supporting characters, standard comic book action... no surprises here."
3,review,"Graphics great. Slow plot. Doesn,t work for me. Liked the actors. How ever. I will watch the sequel. Not a movie to watch over and over. The amazing spider-man."
5,THIS SPIDER-MAN ROCKS!!!,It was better than the first Spider-Man Movie I had seen. It was fun to watch and definitely worth seeing!!
3,I have seen worse,"It was ok. I was not overly impressed with the new Spider-Man actor, but not the worst movie that I have seen."
3,It's OK,"Not great. A bit slow. Very far off Spider-Man 2 (2.1), which easily remains the best Spider-man of all time."
3,Been done,Kind of had some slow spots through out the film . Let's face it this story has been done already.
2,The Not So Amazing Spiderman,"Ever since I was a kid ,I loved movies. I am now much older and nothing has changed. This is why I am disappointed to say that I felt the first 90 minutes of this 2 hour 16 minute movie bored me. It just didn't seem to capture my attention and by the time things began to pick up, I was looking at my watch to see how much time was left before the movie ended. Yes, there were a couple of cool scenes, especially one where he rescues a child from a car dangeling off a bridge.All and all I have one question on this remake, Why?"
3,Typical GNU Reference Book,"This product is typical for GNU-related documentation. The book is relatively complete (at least with respect to its date of publication). As with other GNU tools, most of the information is available on-line and being 'open software'--expect continual changes, additions, etc. If you are one who still likes the feel of a book (e.g., Samuel T. Cogley), who likes to annotate the margins and underline--well this book is just the thing if you plan to use the GNU compiler."
3,Similar to Thomas Dolby & Men At Work,"Okay, I had the orginal LP, Goonhiily Down, back in 1980. I had read a pretty good review in Rolling Stone or Penthouse, someplace. So I ordered it. I'm sure most don't have this in their collection. I'm not quite saying it sucks, but it certainly has that 79/80 feel to it. Maybe my taste have changed in 30 years. The sound is light and quirky, similar to Thomas Dolby or Men At Work. Steve Lindsay is behind it all. He plays keysboard, bass, guitar, drums, & sings, plus he wrote all the songs. Other people are there, too. But it's kinda like the Steve Lindsay Show. It has moments of interest. ""I'm On Fire"" is not bad. ""Break It To Me Gently"" has a nice melody. I'm much less familiar with the songs from Spot. It's pretty retro sounding."
2,NICE BUT NOT A 31 DAY CLOCK,"VERY PRETTY,BUT WE NEED TO WIND THIS EVERY 4 OR 5 DAYS AND IT STILL DOESNT KEEP PERFECT TIME,BUT THE CHIME IS NICE, NOT WORTH SENDING BACK,WILL JUST KEEP A WATCH ON IT AND KEEP WINDING,BUT DONT TELL PEOPLE IT IS A 31 DAY."
4,Great fun,"This craft book comes with it all - 16 different shapes, but also instructions so you learn how to make your own. Flow flowers to fish, fire trucks to felines. And a bunch of craft ideals for what you can use the art for once you have melted the beads. This book will be the jumping off point for hours and hours of fun for the whole family.It comes with:The book600 BeadsIroning PaperPeg board"
3,Rushing around,"If you enjoy rushing from ride to ride without looking to see the magic of Disney, this is the book for you. Well planned out commando raids on each park. The rides were described well. However, I was exhausted after one day of following the exact agenda. I would suggest seeing each park on your own agenda, just know which things were important for YOU to see. Also the restaurant guide sections were too tough on some of the restaurants (so its not haute cuisine). Helpful book but use with others such as the Passporter Disney World book to get a well rounded picture."
4,"truthful,excellent and brilliant detail","The guide is that good I buy it every year so I can imagine Im back at Disney, even when Im not .The reviews are very fair and very acurate ,with the tips about beating the long waits in line make this book worth the price on its own."
4,Must reading before you go to Walt Disny World.,Great book with lots of valuable tips and directions. With this book you can get the most for your time and money while at WDW.This book is well worth the price.
5,A Fascinating Read,"I am not even planning a trip to WDW in the very near future (I've been only once before) but nonetheless I found myself reading this book, practically cover to cover, in one evening. There's no sugarcoated nonsense in this book; the author seems a little harsh on WDW, but from my vantage point, his observations were dead-on. In addition to the details, step-by-step power touring plans for each park and the dining reviews, the author includes a fascinating history of Disney's expansion into Florida. I especially appreciated his counter-guide to Universal Studios Florida, amazingly enough, included in with everything about Disney. On my previous visit to WDW I had no interest in USF, but after reading his review of the park, will be making a stop there on my next trip to Orlando. I have read at least two previous guides to WDW plus countless web pages about the park and not found out a fraction of what I learned from this guide. I can't wait to go back."
2,This book is disheartening!`,"I have to agree that his book is written in a very negative way. I am planning a trip to WDW and am very excited. I bought this book hoping to add to my enthusiasm, but found that I now have more concerns than I did previously. This book has managed to make the ""happiest place on earth"" seem like a chore rather than a happy adventure. The more I read, the more worrisome I become. Not to mention the fast paced race you must make around the park so as not to ""miss anything"". This is a vacation, not marathon. I have yet to read a truly ""good"" review about anything in Disney according to this book. I have been to WDW several times, and I don't believe any of my trips were as miserable as this book seems to make them.There is, however, some good info on the parks if you take it with a grain of salt and DON'T put too much emphasis on the ""reviews and opinions"". This, however, is just my opinion!"
3,Informative to a point.,"I think this guide is a good starting point when obtaining information regarding a Walt Disney World trip. however I feel it could use more information on places to eat outside of Disney World. Also I would like to see more information on what to pack, sun screen use and the like. It rains alot in Disney and the sun gets so hot that it can be unbearable to walk barefoot at the water attractions. Most important use a strong sun screen and try to avoid the hours with the strongest sun rays atleast at the water parks and beaches."
1,Don't waste your money on this,If you have never been to Walt Disney World this book wound talk you out of it. in a heart beat. This is a book written by someone who either is not a kid at heart or never was a kid. Disney is a great place that I visit almost every year and have a great time. By reading this book you would think it's all long lines and yelling kids. Please don't waste your money on this book.
2,Disappointing compared to previous issues,"I find it curious that a book that has been a staple for years has decided to lower its standards and now includes profanity in several places and has descriptions like the following for the ""Pal Mickey"" doll where Mickey allegedly says ""get baked on a good joint right about now. Are you holding?"" (page 329).I realize that this is a cheap attempt at humor, but I don't see why a family book about one of the top family destinations in the world would include this, given their audience."
1,Waste of Time,Part of the fun of going to Walt Disney World is the anticipation. This book has a negative feel to it and takes away some of the fun from the anticipation. A book can give you the real scoop without giving a negative feel. Steer clear of this book in favor of the Passporter series which is done both realistically and kept positive.
4,"Disney, less painful than you expected","I had an earlier version of this guide and it really saved our hides on an earlier trip to the Magic Kingdom with an almost-4-year-old. Like there was a tip on how parents could ride the ""grown-up"" rides by telling the attendants that one of you was waiting with the kiddo(s) and one going up the Matterhorn (or whatever). This was not practical on all rides but the guide said which ones. The tips on early opening and ""commando plans"" were worth their weight in gold.Our best trick was, go first thing in the morning, leave when it gets crowded, nap at the hotel, then come back in the evening. The lines to see Mickey, or Dumbo (which has a notoriously long wait time) are much better in the evening!"
5,The Best WDW Guide I've Encounter,This was definitely one of the best guides I've read so far. I picked it up thinking that I could browse through the categories not covered in other books and ended up not being able to put it down for 3 days!! We're planning our first trip to WDW in November so I'll better be able to see how things rate and I'm planning a modified itinerary based on their touring plans.
4,Excellent Source of Information,This book is an outstanding reference guide for anyone who is planning a trip to Disney. There's tons of information about every aspect of Disney. The only thing to be aware of is they are VERY hard on Food in Disney World.
2,Much ado about very little.,"Lots of folks seem to like this guide. I feel like the only person who sees the Emperor is naked. The tiny type is nearly impossible to read. The layout makes searching for what you want, a nightmare. The maps and charts are confusing. There are grotesquely misfigured, and often naked, caricatures littered throughout. The touring ""tips"" are just common sense, now turned common knowledge. The attractions ratings use elaborate, confusing, unnecessary age grouped star systems, that could easily have been presented as a single rating of age preference. The Unofficial Guide to WDW gives too much information about each ride, possibly spoiling the enchanting experience for new visitors. Yet, it doesn't give any meaningful information regarding vacation planning. The hotel and restaurant reviews are a joke. There was a time when this guide was the undisputed champ. With so many outstanding competing guides, that time is long past."
4,A must have for anyone going to WDW.,"Great book about dining, rides, hotels. They focus a little too much on cost cutting, but other than that a very practical guide. We would have missed a lot without the guidance of this book."
5,Made a potentially disastrous trip a great one instead,"It would be tough to overstate how helpful this book was in planning our recent trip to Disney World. The 700-plus pages may seem excessive, but if you choose the chapters you need from the table of contents, this book can make all the difference in whether you have a stressful trip or an enjoyable one. The book's advice on how to avoid long lines at rides and restaurants was worth the price of the book alone. The writer's sharp insights are complemented by literally hundreds of personal reviews from readers of past editions of the guide. This may be very well be the only guide you need to enjoy Disney World, although I found the ""official"" guide to be very helpful as well, especially in learning the basics of how the different disney parks and resorts are laid out. The ""unofficial"" guide, it should be noted, also has plenty of helpful advice for those visting Universal Studios and Sea World, too."
5,A book that will change your trip to Disney World forever!!,"Some very valuable information brought to you in a clear, concise, and humorus manner.I loved the book and give it very high marks! I would rate it a 10 but the author tends to bash the disney folks a little more than is useful.If your going to Disney World, BUY THIS BOOK! It changed my Disney vacation forever!"
5,Best travel guide book I've ever read,This book has more valuble info about Walt Disney World than any other WDW travel guide available.This unbaised guide is a must for any person traveling to WDW.The only thing wrong with this guide is it does not change very much year to year.
2,Careful this book reviews can be a little nasty.,"Unofficial is true. I felt that the reviews were a little nasty. Someone who buy's this book wants to have a more enjoyable trip, but instead you begin to wonder if you should go."
2,INFORMATION IS NOT CURRENT,I was disappointed to discover that some of the critical informaion in this book was not current.We are going to Disney World for our daughter's 4th Birthday. The one thing she wanted to do most was Breakfast at Cinderella's Table. I've studied this guide for 3 months and had carefully counted the 60 days prior to the date of the breakfast. Today I called at exactly 7 AM and got right through only to find out that the reservations are 90 DAYS IN ADVANCE!!Of course there is nothing available during our entire 10 day stay.I would recommend calling disney directly for information insted of relying on this book!
2,The author's biases are way too evident.,"Although this book has excellent maps and good basic information, I found his constant insertion of his own opinions (usually negative) to be a real distraction. Especially when it comes to the food. My family has been to Disney World six times and while I'll be the first to admit this isn't gourmet it's nowhere near as bad as Sehlinger implies. The general idea in the book seems to be that the Disney people are out to shaft you and you must remain constantly vigilent to keep from being ripped off. Hardly the attitude I want to take with me on vacation."
2,useful book but too thick,"This is a really useful book, tons of tips, saved me a lot $$ and time. The downside is too heavy to carry in the parks.The most valuable thing I learn is to rent a multi-family vacation house with my friends, 16 people for only $199 a day. We all enjoy the stay at a spacious luxury resort. check this out: http://www.cyberrentals.com/index.cfm/property/126687"
5,"A ""must-purchase"" for anyone going to Walt Disney World","I just purchased this book, and I cannot put it down. My wife and I are going next December, and can't wait. I would reccommend this book to anyone: couples, singles, or families. This book gives a ""no holds barred"" perspective; including reviews from readers about what the author told them. His reviews are thorough and complete (note: he reviews everything...rides...restaurants...hotels). At any rate, if your going you can't afford to NOT buy this book."
5,Great trip thanks to this book! Awesome!,"I went to Disney with a 5 month old and a 3 year old almost 2 years ago. I read every inch of the manual it made my vacation the BEST Disney vacation and one of the best vacations of my life. WE didn't wait in ONE line or for more than 10 MINUTES to get into a restaurant. We followed the touring patters to a T and they were excellent. Plus we got a lot of exercise! The restaurant reviews were accurate and we were very pleased with the restaurants that we chose. All I can say is that I went to Disney 5 times before reading this book and that was BEFORE I had children. I saw more with 2 children thanks to this book then we ever saw without them in 5 prior visits! I'm actually buying the 2002 version right now for my next trip. It is a MUST HAVE and will be money very, very well spent! Enjoy!"
5,An Amazing Resource that keeps you a step ahead of the rest,"This book is for anyone wanting to get the real scoop and all the insider secrets to how to tackle this colossal place with a minimal amount of stress. We followed its careful instructions and in April 2002 we had the most carefree vacation ever and waited in lines an average of 15 minutes. After all, when you are spending as much money as Disney World costs - it pays to be a step ahead of the roaring crowds."
5,Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World by Bob Sehlinger,"Bob Sehlinger does an excellent job of creating a travel guide for Walt Disney World. The book is non-biased, tells it like it is and provided very helpful information for traveling to Disney World. He covers just about every facet of travel you could think of. I have looked at several travel guides for Disney World and this book is not just an expensive advertisement for Disney World. It is a first timers best friend. If you can only get one guide, this is the book to get. Bob gets an A+ for this book!"
4,The best of the bunch,"Over the years, I've purchased close to a dozen different WDW guidebooks. This is by far the best. Its coverage of ""the World"" is comprehensive and very balanced. The author explains what he likes and doesn't like--and why, often presenting readers' comments when they don't agree with his. Every attraction (ride), hotel, and restaurant is rated according to a star system. The touring plans, although not infallible, provide an outstanding way to minimize the time you spend standing in line. Best of all, it's written with a great sense of humor--necessary in a 700-page travel guide.Some quibbles: The author provides a balanced view of the advantages and disadvantages of lodging and dining outside Walt Disney World, but the guide's coverage of off-property hotels and restaurants is very sparse. The maps, although serviceable, are not the greatest."
5,a definate buy to plan your trip to Walt Disney World,"This guide provides a realistic view of planning and participating in a Disney World vacation (and often humorous insites from readers). The book praises that which is good and shoots down that which is not. This is the 3rd unofficial guide I have used. It can seem kind of ""commando"" at times. Use what you need and store the rest for info. Restaraunt reviews are great. It is very lacking in lodging specifics. You'll need to read another guide book for that.It is behind the times in a few areas but nothing that you can't live with. I'm waiting anxiously for November to arrive so I can purchase the 98 version. If you have never been to Disney World or have only been once before or you have not LEARNED from your past MISTAKES, this is a must if you want a vacation thats less stressfull than most Disney visitors--get this book. Most people do not realize that a Disney vacation can be stressfull. Read and find out why"
5,Excellent for the whole family!,"I think the Unoffical Guide is a must read for anyone venturing on their first, fifth or fiftieth trip to the WORLD!! It is packed with innumerable tips and tricks for the whole family. So good, in fact, that my sister was unable to put it down because of the comic strips that go along with the descriptions. My family and I are returning for our second trip in two years. None of us can wait to try the itineraries listed in the book. We believe in ""Blitzing"" all competition!!"
4,great start,this book is chocked full of intimate detials that it is hard to pass it up. It could use a few more details on getting discounts such as those found on places like mousesavers.com but the comparisions on hotels and restuarants and detail of the rides is great. Read it before you start planning.
3,Unoffical Guide to Walt Disney World 2002,"I wonder if the author of this book is employed by Disney competitors? He sure doesn't seem to like Disney much. Very negative. If your trying to decide on a Disney vaction or not this is not the book for you. The author makes Disney seem like H...on earth. On the other hand there are some good points in this book. If you're not sure which Disney guide to buy, make this your last choice."
2,Buyer Beware,"I was sadly disappointed today when I called to make reservations to the Princess Breakfast at Cinderella's Castle. Evidently, Disney has changed their priority seating to 90 days in advance, not 60 days as stated in the book. And this policy changed a year ago!!!! Unfortunately I trusted this book and followed it's advice about getting reservations, and as a result called 30 days too late!! Very disappointed reader!!"
2,"The same-old, same-old!","I love to read travel books, especially ones on Walt Disney World. However, this company needs to take a serious look at revamping and re-writing this tired old thing. C'mon Bob, most people go to Disney World every three or so years. When we turn to your book, we would like some new stories and fresh reviews.I bought this book in 1995 and it is still filled the same old, same old stories. ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZTime for an update. Spend your money other places for a fresh, new approach to ""the World"". Anyplace that changes as much as Disney World does, deserves a fresh approach every now and then.In addition, I feel the food critics were too harsh. Let's face it, most people do not go to Walt Disney World expecting fine world cuisine. If that's what you like, you probably do not like park food in general. I'm telling you that the food was far superior than Big Old Bob lets you know."
2,Not helpful,"I was disappointed with the book. You can find a lot of the information on the web at places like the unofficial Disney homepage, etc. There's a whole lot of subjectivity built into the writing and there's not much to offer in terms of real nuggets. The dining section was the best and most helpful."
1,Very negative,"I found this guide to be very negative. It is true that Walt Disney World is a daunting vacation destination, but it is also very magical vacation. With the right information and good planning, the trip can be the vacation of your dreams. This book makes it seem like a depressing and torturous ordeal. I would be surprised if anyone wanted to go to Disney World after reading this book."
1,"Great Premise, Turgid Execution","If you're a fan of Hewson's Nic Costa novels, save your money on this one. The premise is interesting -- a period of intense sunspot activity coincides with eco-terrorists getting control of a sort of ""Goldeneye"" satellite that can make people spontaneously combust. But we never really know what the protagonist, Lieberman, wants, only that he is p.o.ed about the military-industrial complex having turned his idea for creating unlimited solar energy into a weapons system. In fact, it's hard to get into anybody's head here -- they're all pretty dimensionless.If you read ""A Season for the Dead"" along with ""Solstice,"" you'd never in a million years believe they came from the same author. Just goes to show that a determined writer can make the leap from so-so to brilliant with talent and determination."
3,"Great when it comes to Slugfest, but stinks in Career","This could be a really great boxing game. Some of the best boxers in the world are featured, and the gameplay is excellent. That is until you get into the career mode.Many of the players lose their skill when going into their careers, and the computer predetermines who will win the next fight. You could be beating the snot out of your opponent, while you give up little health, but he come's right back and KO's you, and the computer won't let you back up.That's the major problem with this game. Other than that, I have no beef against it."
1,"Fun for the first day, [weak] after that","... Muhammad Ali is like a superhuman, George Foreman isn't in it, and the response from the controller is very, very slow. (for example, if you press the ""a"" button five times very quickly, the character you are will start punching about a second later, and will punch very slowly) I'll admit that the character selection is pretty good, but i had this game for about 7 months, and I must have played it about 4 times total. If you want a good boxing game, get ""Ready 2 Rumble"". This game is very easy also."
1,They sell old product!!,"DO NOT BUY FROM THEM. The squeeze bottle is so old that it cracks when you use it...I had to apply without it...very frustrating. These boxes of hair color are so old that the coupons inside expired in 2008. Also, they don't include that little vial of oil that you add to the mix."
4,Curious George: Back to School,"I liked the DVD and bought it for our library. I did think that there were a lot of commericals before the actual program began, but I think children will enjoy it."
3,Curious George: Back to School,Another good item from the PBS arena. Grand-daughter just loves to watch George and she learned how to read by watching him and paying attention to the background words.
1,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,"OK - Just to be fair I must say that it does charge my Zune. But if you want to play your Zune in the car (through your car audio device) while hooked up to the charger FORGET ABOUT IT!! The cable is unshielded and you will get nothing but loud hum and static. Oh and buy the way, this same IDENTICAL item is sold on Amazon for $22.95 by BoxWave - the guts, cable and connector are the same except for the brand. I bought 5 just in case one or two didn't work - they all charged as advertised but without the shielding this item is useless for me. Oh well, I'm only out a couple of bucks."
5,great charger,i cant believe that this car charger was so cheap! zune sells one for about $30 and i got this one for about $5! it works great and i've had it for over a year
2,worked but broke quickly,it worked nicely as long as it worked and was not broken. it is a bit flimsy in its construction so after a few weeks it fell apart..
1,A definite waste of money,"Very disappointed with this item! It never charged the Zune, and then in a matter of minutes, the cable became unattached from the charger!!! I would certainly NOT recommend this item to anyone. If I could give it less stars I would."
1,A Joke,the battery was a complete joke.got it and it had an 86% charge on it.charged it full and it lasted 30 min MAX!!!don't waste ya money
1,not a good replacement battery,"only had this battery a few months and it's already shot, charging to 6%. I should have known better than buy a knock-off battery...just buy the HP."
1,Do you really want to buy some basketball game?,All you'll be doing is shooting and passing there is absolute no fun in doing those things.All basketball games are not fun to play.Dont waste your money. Ardavan Algooneh
2,Horrible Get NBA Courtside 2 Or The PC Version,"This Game Is One Of The WORST Basketball Games I Have Ever Played. I created a player with max attributes on the Grizzlies and did a Full 3 minutes per quarter arcade mode game of The Indiana Pacers Vs The Vancouver(Now Memphis) Grizzlies, My created player had missed 3 3 point baskets and 2 or 3(don't remember now) Dunks and when i go for a layup, my player doesn't do a layup, instead they do a shot while leaning. My team won by 20 something points. I'm giving it 2 stars because Michael Jordan Is In It. So I RecommendNBA Courtside 2 featuring Kobe Bryantor the pc version of the game:NBA Live 2000"
1,Sucks really bad,"Nba Live 2000 is a stupid game. The players always miss their inside shots, Kobe Bryant misses all of his shots. I Created a super team with custom features and made have 100% on all off their atributes. My guy missed 2/5 dunks, made no jump shots and got stuffed atleast 20 times. Foul shots r 2 easy and the players lean 2 much in their shots. If i could rate this game 0 stars, i would. I can't believe i wasted ... $ on a junk game. Don't buy it, please!"
1,The most boring basketball game ever,This is difinatly the worst basketball game I have ever played. If you want to waste your money on worthless junk buy this game. The on game graphics are absolutely terrible and the sound totally stinks. You have to know absolutely everything there is to know about basketball to have any idea of what you are doing. The slams are terribly unrealistic and the players facial graphics are horrible. This is most likely the worst Nintendo game I have ever played and I would not advise anybody to buy it unless you are a total looser. I give this game an ugly half star.
4,Fun for all ages,"A frequent topic that comes up in conversatins with me is what is a good basketball game? There were always only 2 contendors, the NBA Live Series and NBA Jam. After the 2000 series of both games came out, it was clear that Live was better for anyone. I especially like 1 on 1 with MJ and the 3 points shootout. Overall its fun for one player to play a season or four players to play arcade b-ball. Happy Shooting!"
5,Jackson County Jail widescreen....awesome!!!,"Finally after all these years it is good to finally get Jackson County Jail in widescreen DVD. The VHS I have of it is worn out and looked horrible. I am shocked they double billed it with Caged Heat. What was Shout! thinking? These two movies are totally different from one another. Jackson County Jail should have been released on its own, because there is no other low budget movie like it. It shouldn't even be catagorized as a 'women in prison flick'. Don't get me wrong Caged Heat is a good movie in it own right, but not up to the standard of Jackson County Jail. Watching this I now realize why Tommy Lee Jones became the phenominal actor he has become. To me, he steals the show!Dont't expect a whole lot out of this title for special features, but hey both movies are anamorphic widescreen and they look pretty good for the low budget movies they are."
5,How can you miss with Bayer?,"This is a good product, at a reasonable price (cheaper than the grocery store). How could you go wrong with Bayer?"
3,"""use before date""","the product was good but the ""use before date"" was too close to finish the package. Maybe they should write info of the dates before you buy them."
5,Great for my Masters program,I ordered this textbook in order to complete my Masters program in Teaching English as a Foreign Language and Applied Linguistics. It covers all that I need. Good for English or History students
2,Buyer beware,"This vendor sells many similar watches, and they are decent, considering the price. However 2 of my 7 watches were defective, and emails to the vendor were never answered.Bruce"
4,Venta replacement filter,"I bought a Venta air humidifier in the Winter 2007/08 and we are very much satisfied with it. However, depending on the frequence you use it, you have to change from time to time the filter. As we are using it 24/7 in the heating period, it must be replaced all 2-3 month. Unfortunately, in the shop where we bought the air humidifier (bed, bath & beyond) we could not buy the filters anymore. But with Amazon we could get them and even much cheeper as in the shop and the filters were delivered within a few days"
3,"When it works, it works","I've had the Venta Sonic 370 for a year now, and i think i've had to return it 2xs. I love that it's quiet and pumps out a ton of moisture. The white box is delicate and like other reviewers said, it does not last that long. I think I got a replacement machine from Venta, and the thing stopped working within a month of usage. It turned on, but slowly eked out a thin amount of moisture. Then it just stopped. So i figured, ""ok, one more time i'll buy a new filter and see if that's the culprit."" If not, i was going to throw it out. My other Vick's humidifier for $32 works just fine, so i would have been sorry to see the Venta go, but hey, i'm not spending $65 a season just to keep it going. So...now that this product has it's problems, but when it's working, it's really good i think."
3,Short Life,"We like the quiet function of our Venta humidifier and the ease of changing filters.However, the life of the filter is half to two thirds of what is advertised. It takesat least two filters to get through winters or $66.00 to operate the humidifier eachwinter. Our water is average clarity and sediment."
1,Rip off,"Typical -you pay extra for an expensive humidifier thinking the quality will justify the extra money. It doesn't. The ""maintenance free unit"" (just a glorified filter) lasts less than a season, even using it only a few hours at night. And the part costs as much as a whole cheap (but equally effective) humidifier with a conventional filter. So much for German quality!"
3,Gac-Vencor #1090036,Pro's: I found this product performs as promised with no maintenance or other cleaning. It provides a very fine mist into the air and promptly adds moisture to the air as promised. It is also very quite and extremely easy to fill.Con's: It is costly.I would recommend this product.
1,Great brand. Yuk aftertaste!,"Ill leave a simple review here:Product is rated very well on Envirnmental Working Group's skincare guide for cosmetics.Cleans pretty well, but the after taste is simply bad.Not a clean after taste. Had to return it.Happier with Toms Wicked Fresh Spearment Ice, a fresher cleaner taste left behind."
3,I'm glad its eco-friendly but it taste,It taste like I'm brushing with baking soda. I love Tom's customer service and I love their eco-efforts and other products but I'm not so sure there toothpaste is something I'll get again....with that said I would rather use their spearmint toothpaste than the cinnamon one. The cinnamon paste is just nasty.
2,Expensive with same contents as regular Flouride paste,I bought Aquafresh for $1.50. I bought Tom's for approx $5 with exactly same major ingreds and quantity as Aquafresh. There is hardly any taste in the paste. Do not recommend.
4,Good Stuff,"It can be kinda tough to find good guitar books for the intermediate/advanced player looking to go up a notch. This is definately a good book for that. This is not for beginners. From start to finish it's all a challenge. I've definately added some new licks and technique to my bag, especially in the string bending department. The cd is invaluable and it's great to play along with. I usually start off trying to play the solos note for note but end up wandering off doing my own thing. Another good feature is that the solos stay within one key and the scales/positions used are explained before the solo. So instead of just learning a solo, you also learn how to apply the licks in your overall playing."
3,"Well, maybe.","This is a solid book and worth reading if you are interested in the Iliad and/or the relationships between war and culture, but in all deference to Ms. Hernandez, Prof. Tatum's classes were hardly oversubscribed and he is much better known for his work on Plautus and Roman comedy. Which is not to detract from the quality of this particular volume at all."
3,"Entertaining, although not what it could have been.","The 2nd book in the Jim Rook series is certainly an improvement on the first, but still fails to live up to Masterton's earlier work. The writing style is crisp, if overly simple and some ideas are great, but the characters aren't fleshed out as much as one would hope. The final scene which features a body part being used as a football was very quirky and is worth the price of admission. The Native American mythology added some more intrigue to the tale. If you read the first and liked it, this is a fun continuation of the story. The ending will leave you wanting to read the 3rd in the series, which I certainly plan to do! I just hope they keep getting better."
3,Not happy with cover,"The story was good; however, apparently I overlooked that this book was paperback instesd of hard cover. I will have to be more careful in the future."
5,Auschwitz; The Nazi's and the Final Solution,This book is an intense look into the politics of the evolution of the concetration and death camps. There are some things in the book that I have never heard about before. The author is very good and I have ordered some of his documentary BBC videos also.
2,nail head,"I only wear helmets when I have to. This one is no different. A helmet is a helmet. If you get the right size, and it's well made, they all feel the same and serve the same purpose. The only issue I had with this one is, like many others, the cushioning and padding material is so thick, and the outer shell is so large, you look and feel like a bobble head doll as you go down the highway. It's not unlike most other helmets on the market today though. Eventually, someone will come up with one that passes all of the DOT tests, but is lighter, smaller, more comfortable. Money is relative to the quality of the 'hat'. You get what you pay for. This one is par for the course. It's a reasonable hat at a reasonable price."
2,Beware if you have Safari 3.2,"I just received this product. I have a Macbook with Safari 3.2 and they are not compatible. I had to purchase the 2007 version of White book. I think the software itself is wonderful, but be careful if you purchase this older version and you have Safari. There is a download at the Quickverse website if you have other net browsers, but Quickverse has an agreement with Safari, so the download won't help if you have the most recent version of Safari."
3,a nice read,This book was a nice read about two sisters trying to find there way to each other but there were times I felt the author could have expanded the story. There were a lot of unanswered questions that was not answer in the story.
4,A Great Read........,"Shelia Goss's book ""Roses Are Thorns, Violets Are True"" was an amazing book. It showed the importance of family. Showed how we should be able to forgive one another if we want 'God' to forgive us.It was a wonderful story of twins growing up in the span of about 20 years. The heartache of betrayal is highly evident and sometimes a touch shocking. Yet through the entire story, Shelia kept it real and exciting. It had a few twist and turns I didn't expect, but it bought out the story line very well. The novel makes you refelect on your own family life and how it should be.Thank you for sharing Shelia!!!"
4,Great picture guide,"This book has a great variety of recipes. It has something to offer for everyone. This is one of the few cookbooks that actually offers several pictures of each recipe while it is being made. This book is great if you want to try something a bit different, and you might not know quite how to do it. Recipes are well written and easy to follow."
4,A great live album,"For fans of die Aerzte, this is a must-have album. One of the two CDs essentialy features live versions of the band's album ""13"", while the other features a selection of some of die Aerzte's older but timeless songs. The best feature, though, is the 3"" mini-CD, which features 40-odd minutes of ""Ansagen,"" which are the random, often crass, invariably funny comments that the band throws out during their shows. The dialogue gave me a headache until I realized that the mixers of the album cleverly doubled the amount of Ansage-time by recording 20 minutes on the right stereo channel and a completely different 20 minutes on the left. Listen to them one channel at a time for best comprehension."
4,Wordgirl,"I thoguht is was in a good dvd, a nice case, and the moive can early enough for me to injoy it!"
2,As clear as mud,"Tureck does a nice job of sculpting some of the Preludes, like the ones in C-sharp major and B-flat major from Book I, and seems to approach all of the pieces with real devotion. Overall, though, her playing tends to be heavy-handed and belabored. Although she exercises great control over the keyboard, she is less successful at holding the listener's interest and bringing the music to life. Slow tempi in Bach's keyboard works, which have been used to great effect by other pianists, turns the music to mush in Tureck's hands."
4,Complete but somewhat dated,"As an ER PA I find this large text full of many procedures useful in emergency medicine. However, by todays standards the B&W pictures and drawings are very dated. An alternative worth considering; with better pictures and detailed descriptions would be: Emergency Medicine Procedures by Eric Reichman and Robert Simon."
5,One of the most important texts in your office,"I am an attending physician in Emergency Medicine, and through residency and even today, I have used this reference more than any other. It is a must have for anyone in the field. It would be extremely helpful for anyone in primary care as well"
1,"save yourself the pain, DO NOT BUY THIS EXCUSE FOR A GAME","We ordered the Reel Deal Vegas from Amazon.com in the beginning of February. When it eventually arrived,(three weeks later, thank you Amazon.Com) we could not play the game because we needed patches.We got the patches, lucky us.We had originally ordered Real Deel Slots in December and we were very happy with it. This game is great! It was supposed to be in partnership with Reel Deal Vegas and the games enjoyment would be doubled. But,when we downloaded the patches to Reel Deal Vegas, all of the information for Reel Deal Slots was erased.We would request another patch, (they have so many patches it makes us wonder why they cannot just make a good product) but why try?It is an inferior product and if you are thinking of buying it, save yourself the pain."
5,A must have,"If you are into Computer Casino Games then this is a must have for you. Stunning Graphics, MP3 Music, Live on line tournaments against real people, Tutorials for beginers, and the ability to advance with in the game to earn more enhancments and other cool stuff.This game is a must as is its partner Bonus Mania, which along with this games create a whole casino online ( without robbing you blind)"
2,Hard to play,"While I have several Reel Deal slots/casino games, this is the worst one to play. It takes forever to launch. And during play of the game Triple Play, the game freezes up during play. You then have to exit game, and forfeit any monies won. Customer services is a joke. I've emailed them regarding my problems, and have received no response at all. This game is a waste of money."
3,It's Ok,This game has good graphics. Game play is ok I have had trouble with the game cutting off. so I consider it average.
1,Forced to use preprietary software playing video files with sound,"I got this camcorder yesterday. After taking some video images, I transferred the files to my PC and renamed the file extension from ""MOD"" to ""MPG"". It turns out that there is no audio playing the recorded video files using Microsoft Media Player 10. My Studio 8 software also failed to ""initialize the audio file"". To listen to the audio, I have to use the ""Power DVD 5"" or ""CyberLink PowerDirector Express"" came with the camcorder. As we all know that the video image software came with the camcorder is very limited. To do anything meaningful, I have to buy their upgrade. So far, I could not find a way to convert the MPG files to a compatible format so that I can play and edit them in Studio 8 or Media Player. For this reason, I'm going to return the camcorder to the vendor soon."
2,Not really worth it,"I got these because a lot of the nursing bras in my size were unlined (something I'm NOT used to). These didn't do much good at all. Not only did I still ""point"" at people, you could also see the flower outline shape these things were cut into under some of my shirts (even when I had on two shirts). They only seemed to work when I was really warm (but then I probably didn't even need them!)"
3,Great Product but no movie recording capability,"This is a geat product that I have been waiting for. But, the fact that this device could not record any movie (comparing to: Lyra RD2780, Archos, and more are coming with movie recording capability) really make this product inferior.I have called the customer service and they told me that they don't have any plan to support the movie recording capability.I hope they can oversee this weakness and change their mind to support the movie recording capability on the next firmware release."
4,iRIVER PMP,"I have had my media player for about 3 weeks and it is great onceyou figure out how to work it, the user manual is a piece of trash!Converting dvd to the formats that are supported takes a bit of time and finding a freeware program to do it is a little hard but can be done.Picture quality is very good audio quality is good battery life is great.I also wish that you could record video directly to the hard drive.Would make loading movies alot easier."
1,Faulty Faulty Faulty!,"I was given this as a gift for Christmas and just over 3 months after I recieved it, I put it on charge for a night, and came back to it and the screen had a dead spot in it. The next time I put it on charge, it completely messed up the whole screen to where now nothing is visible anymore. And the player only has a 90 day warranty, and when I tried to contact Iriver about the problem, I recieved no response. You will probable be better off buying an Ipod that plays both mp3s and videos instead of this product."
5,"beautiful pictures & tasty, easy recipes",the recipient of this book loved it! She makes soups frequently & makes alot of the soups that were included in the book but she said these recipes included ingredients she hadn't tried in some of her soups; the pictures were beautiful & the recipes seemed easy enough for even the busiest cook....
3,Just okay,"I got this book yesterday, and I'm okay with it. Not any great recipes and I could have found the same for nothing on the internet."
1,Too many ingredients,"I was hoping for easy and delicious. Not the case. There are too many ingredients required, some of which I had to google to find out what they are. Will definitely be selling this book at my next garage ssle."
5,Silver Pewter Wiccan Angel Lilith Pendant Necklace,Necklace was beautiful.Necklace arrived in a very timely fashion.Necklace arrived in excellent condition.
4,Very Basic but a good place to begin,"The title says it all for this book. The author skillfully takes the reader on a step-by-step tour of basic sketching techniques. Throughout the book each project has detailed illustrations showing how the sketches should look as the reader follows along. It covers several drawing media including pencils, charcoal, pastel pencils, water soluble colored pencils, etc. The instruction covers basic sketching, shading, and composition techniques. Sketching subjects in the lessons include fruits, vegetables, natural forms, plants, flowers, trees, skies, water, landscapes, animals, people, buildings, people and the seaside. If you have had no art training and don't know where to begin or just want to try your hand at sketching then this is an excellent place to start."
4,Great for beginners and older parents,"I bought this book for my father over a year ago who is over 70 and wanted to try a new hobby. I thought perhaps sketching would be good because who as a kid didn't like to doodle. After doing a lot of research, I found this book at the bookstore and found it to be a great place to learn the basics. My father loved this book and continues to sketch to this day."
5,This is the best Hip Hop to come out of the UK,"UK Hip Hop is on the up and up with acts like Roots Manuva now becoming mainstream. Skitz 'Countryman' really is one record that I found to be truly outstanding in its class. The album takes you on a journey through the cream of the UK's MC and DJs producing some more original and even ground-breaking music. Task Force excel on 'Junkyard' and other standout tracks include 'Where My Mind Is At' and 'Fingerprints of the Gods' being my own personal favourite. Roots Manuva shows what a talented MC he really is on this album so check his album 'Brand New Second Hand' as well. Give UK Hip Hop a chance for some underground, real and frankly outstanding music. This album is the best album I have ever heard in my entire life!"
2,Surprisingly shallow and dreary,"I'm normally a big Anne Tyler fan, so this one surprised me. I confess too that I couldn't bring myself to finish it. It was just so unenjoyable that I finally excused myself. The characters were so flat! A few actions reported, but no insight into feelings or motivations. Just a collection of sad people working against themselves and each other for no clear reason. I never had that feeling with her other books. Oh well. Not every book will please every reader."
2,Boring; no depth,"First, let me first say Amazon's ""product review"" shows the reviewer did not read the book. ""Mrs. Pamela Evans"" is Mrs. Pamela Emerson. None of the characters is particularly likable. The family is not likeable. Elizabeth's three-word answers to most things is especially irritating. The only interaction that has any human warmth to is is between elizabeth and Mr. Cunningham. It was a very disappointing read for me as I am a big Anne Tyler fan."
2,"By turns wierd (and not in a good way), frustrating, and boring","I have a hard time understanding how anyone could say that the characters in this book are well developed...that was one of the things that frustrated me the most: I kept wondering how a character got from point A to point B, and I couldn't picture several of the characters (especially the Emerson kids) separately in my head.To me the ultimate sign of how this book didn't capture my full interest was that on a plane I read almost to the end before I had to close it to deplane...and it was days later before I realized that I hadn't actually finished the book.Ultimately unsatisfying."
3,Although the Low Strength Aspirin is easier on ...,"Although the Low Strength Aspirin is easier on my stomach, I personally wouldn't buy it. Basically, it didn't get rid of the headaches I've had lately. I'd rather buy a higher dose and have the upset stomach but not the headache instead of the other way around."
4,I used the product for the pain in ...,"I used the product for the pain in both my neck and shoulder that I've been experiencing recently. I took the product at night, as that's when I have the most pain. I was pleasantly surprised! The first night I got a good night's sleep with little discomfort, so I've continued to take it. I really liked the product. I thought maybe I would experience an upset stomach since I normally take Advil, but I had no problem. The only drawback is the number of pills you have to take -- but that's the only problem I had with it. I'd definitely buy and recommend this product to others."
2,Not an auspicious start to the Series,"Edmund White's fixation on Proust's homosexuality mars, indelibly, this otherwise interesting short biography and presents the reader an inauspicious beginning to this Penguin series."
3,"A good overview, but not very deep","Hmm. I'm not sure what to make of this book. It's relatively brief (165 short pages), informative, well-written and easy to read. I'd read ""Remembrance of Things Past"" 15-20 years ago, but knew next-to-nothing of Proust himself. I was most interested in (1) his background, primarily his childhood; and (2) how it was possible that an unpublished author could get such a beast published. Edmund White addresses both issues to a degree (most satisfactorily on the second), but concentrates (not unreasonably, I guess) on people and events from Proust's life that make their way into the novel.I found White's ""Marcel Proust"" to be enjoyable, but it mainly whetted my appetite for a more substantial biography. Perhaps that's part of the purpose of this series of books."
4,A good story despite a mediocre film,"Most of the B5 fans I know were disappointed in the Thirdsapce movie. (It didn't compare well to the incredible effort of In The Beginning.) However, Thirdspace is actually a pretty nice story that comes out much better in the print version.Things certainly make much more sense, at least.I do notice a distressing similarity to ""The Touch of Your Shadow, the Whisper of Your Name"" (novel 5) -- they're by no means the exact same story, but they are similar."
3,"Fun, short","I've found that the danger in short story collections is that they tend to include too many stories; the bad weighing down the good, and the changes in tone and tempo like literary whiplash.In 'Great Adventure Stories' this does not seem the issue. There are only five stories and though they are distinct (written by such giants as Rudyard Kipling and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle) their nineteenth-century style seems to ease transitions. I found each story more engaging and charming than the last. By the end I almost felt like I was seated in front a roaring fire in the libraries of one of these British authors.Stories are simple and short, with the focus always on a main protagonist and the point an adventure (naturally). This would make a fun, intriguing book to anyone under fourteen (though I'd skip the first story) and a good, distracting book to kill a couple hours for any adult (I finished it on a single flight)."
5,Great purchase,I purchased this DVD unit as I travel significantly on long flights and long layovers in airports. The extended battery life and large screen were appealing to me. I've used it many times over the first 30 days with no problems at all. I highly recommend this unit.
4,Top of the line,"Great sharp system. Long battery duration important for long flights - but sound/volume is limited, so get sharp clear headphones."
5,Great choice,"We have this portable DVD player and we love it. It has great battery life, image is excellent, it has an OK to good volume level and it comes with a special attachment so you can strap it to the back of a seat in a car."
3,"Pay a lot get a little - battery time, that is","Even with the user reviews telling of less than 12 hours of battery time (as advertised) I expected maybe 2/3 of the 12 hours, but nope, I get 4.5 hours max. I do use highest brightness and color, but if you are buying just for battery life, save your money. Other than that, it's a nice product.I wonder what the actual battery time is for brands that advertise 6 hours of battery life?"
4,"looks good , plays well. no issues.","I do not seem to have a lot to say yet, its been a month that i have bought this.I like it, i use it, my son uses it more than my self, did not have a problem yet nor i noticed any gap that bothered me.Did i feel super excited about it? no really, but my need is met without any gap.its nice that it can chnage the angles of the screen, you cannot rotate it from left to right and around like few others.Not sure if this review is really going to be useful, because i do not have a strong + or negative points.Bottom line, looks decent, works well, meets the need,no issues."
1,BUYER BEWARE - PANASONIC DISCONTINUES BATTERIES MAKING YOUR PURCHASE USELESS !!!,"I purchased a Panasonic LX9 portable dvd player in 2004 for over $800. Until recently I was quite satisfied with it. However, the detachable battery just went bad and needs replacing. Panasonic has discontinued making the battery. Without it, my dvd player no longer works. So, my expensive investment is now quite useless. All Panasonic is prepared to do is give a small discount to buy a new but much inferior model. So, MY ADVICE IS : DON'T BUY PANASONIC - AS YOU'LL NEVER KNOW IF THE BATTERY CAN BE REPLACED."
2,Panasonic DVD,"I truly would NOT waste your money on this DVD. I wanted the long life battery, and that's the only good thing about this player. Picture and sound are NOT good at all. I have a much cheaper Panasonic portable DVD player that has features way superior to this thing. Too bad the battery life is not as long. I am returning it soon. My advise DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PLAYER."
5,Great Video!,This is a great video because there are 3 routines to choose from. Each routine is very different and only 10 minutes long. If you want to work on your legs I definitely recommend this video.
2,Good Scanner - Only Buy with An Extended Warranty,"This is my 2nd HP scanner. The first lasted 6 years, this one 6 months. The scanner seemed a little slow but did a good job of scanning. I don't use one everyday so I don't need a high end scanner. At light usage I did expect the scanner to last longer than 6 months. Since this is a relatively inexpensive scanner, repairing it is not cost effective. My next scanner will be from Canon which I have found out has a 1-year warranty rather than only 90 days."
2,Waste Of Time,"I bought this scanner as a replacement for my older Mustek 1200UB. I made a mistake and promply returned it for a refund. The quality was very nice, however, the scanner produced little horizontal lines all the way down the right side. This was unacceptable as I had bought the scanner to do a project where I'd be scanning lots and lots of old family photos for storage. I'm not trying to be too negative about this scanner, but the software was difficult to use as well. I'd set certain defaults and it would revert back to the originals even after I told it to default to my saved settings. I hated having to click on File, Import, Scanner every time I wanted to scan something in Photoshop. I wanted the scanning software to remain open and allow me to scan batches at a time. No, I had to re-open the software for every single scan, which meant having to wait for the splash screen to go away and then wait on the lamp to warm up. Needless to say, I'm back using my old Mustek. :("
4,"Grande Fabi, Grande Pedro!!!!","Este disco es uno de los mejores de Fabi, y con Pedro al mando mas que genial. Temas hermosos con arreglos buenisimos y Fabi cantando al tope. No pierdas tiempo, compralo"
5,Emotional Roller-coaster,This book is so well written. It takes you through a roller-coaster of emotions; laughing one minute; crying the next. Very descriptive. I can highly recommend this one!
3,"A less interesting UK version of ""Get Thrashed""","The title says it all. It's not bad, but the fact that it's a thrash documentary with Metallica splashed all over the packaging(both sides of the cover, the spine, the disc label and the title itself, with no involvement from the band)in an obvious and lame effort to move copies should tell you something right off the bat. The dvd also opens with a clip from a Lars Ulrich interview-there goes a star right there."
1,Horrible,This was a total waste of money. It worked well for maybe a week. The mouse has malfunctioned every since.
2,Adverse side effects,"It is an effective combination at first, but a couple of months into using it the mouse started acting weird. I also noticed that once I started using it my screensaver started becoming unreliable; sometimes it never came on. I stopped using the mouse for a while and the screensaver worked fine again. A couple of days ago, I decided I was tired of using the laptop mouse while using it at home, so I plugged the mouse back in, and the screensaver stopped working again. I have had no problems with the keyboard, but why would you buy a keyboard/mouse combo if one part doesn't work?"
2,"Keyboard fine, mouse AWFUL!","This set came with a computer that we bought last August. While we've had no problems with the keyboard (and have only used one set of batteries for it during all the time we've had this), the mouse has been a major headache. It tracks slowly, eats batteries (the 2 days is hardly much of an exaggeration), and even with new batteries it can be slow and unresponsive. It's a terrible mouse to use for any kind of gaming (esp. FPS or flying games, or any games in which timing is critical). The tech support is virtually non-existent, as is user information-the manual doesn't indicate how to tell the batteries are low (I guess you're supposed to figure that out based on reduced performance, or that you've been using the computer for a week, whichever comes first). We plan to keep the keyboard but replace the mouse!"
1,Horrible,"The range on this wireless desktop is horrible, I have to have the receiver 4 inches away from the mouse for it to pick up anything at all. The keyboard isn't too bad, the only thing its missing is mac compatibility. The mouse is what bring this combo down, the battery life is around 2 days, so you will have to get 2 sets of rechargeable batterys and always keep one charged so you can switch them when one set dies."
2,"Mouse works great, keyboard doesn't work at all","I bought this combo a few months ago, and I've never been able to get the keyboard to be seen by Windows. When I loaded the drivers for the keyboard's extra keys, I can get those to be seen by Windows, but the rest of the keyboard doesn't respond at all. At least the mouse is working ok, and for $30 for a wireless optical mouse, its not half bad."
3,It was really good but the ending wasn't a real ending,This was a good book I liked the characters of Hannah and Fergy!I've always enjoyed stalker books! He is a pretty good writer but I wasn't happy with the ending! If anyone else reads this book tell me what you think!
1,Caution! Not runes as we know them.,"The key word on the cover is ""runes"", and many will assume that runes are the major topic of the book. Many will also assume this from the product description. Many may be disappointed.This set of symbols is the author's own creation, and bears little resemblance to the characters defined by academics, and most other speculative books, as runes, ie the Germanic ""Elder Futhark"" runes.Claims that this set is an ""older"" version of the futhark runes are just not supported by any academic source on runes.By all means read this book for the Goddess content, which I am sure will inspire many, but be sure to pick up a reliable book on runes first. Any of these will do.Runes (Reading the Past, Vol 4)Rudiments of RuneloreRunes: An IntroductionRunic Amulets and Magic Objects"
1,I can tell this book is new age,"From an Asatruar's point of view: any book that says your interpretation about the runes is what matters isn't based in ancient lore. I'm sorry people, but no matter how much you try to use Thurisaz to help your love life, it AINT GONNA WORK. Why do i say this? In one of the Sagas, a rune master came across a sick girl; he found under her bed a whale stone with runes carved into it; someone tried to make her fall in love with him. Why didn't it work? because he used the wrong runes. If your interpretation is what mattered most, then the spell would have worked, wouldn't have it? And runes are meant to be made out of wood; rune STONES were 2 ton monuments."
5,River Tube,Two areas need to be inflated. It's big to store in a boat. I'm sure it's perfect for a river. That's why it's a river tube.
3,Interesting,This book answers a lot of questions yet raises many more. How did Black Sun start? What deadly flaw was the Emporer hiding? A very interesting read.
4,So many favorites!,"This book reads like a novel. I love the essay that prefaces each recipe. Very entertaining reading. As for the recipes, I love the pot roast. That has become a favorite. The cinnamon rolls are fabulous. And the waffles recipe is the best I've ever tried. They really do stay crispy like she promises. The only flaw is the pumpkin pie recipe. The filling was way too much for the 9"" pan size recommended. If overflowed in my oven causing a HUGE mess. I live at a pretty high altitude, so maybe that was the problem too."
2,Buyer beware,"I am a good cook who also appreciates the reasons why something does or doesn't work, so the format of the book appealed to me. My first run was with the 90-minute pot roast. I was following the recipe meticulously until my husband said ""90 minutes at 450 for a 2-1/2 pound chuck roast? No way!"" We checked the roast after 60 minutes and it was definitly time to pull it out of the oven. I think the recipe was poorly edited. It should have said to heat the oven to 450 and then lower it to 325 when putting the roast in. Anyway, the flavor of the roast was good, and the lesson learned was to keep common sense in mind when following other recipes from the book."
3,Too much trial and error,"This is a very unusual cookbook. For each recipe, there's a few pages about experiments she did to come up with the final recipe.In that, this reads a whole lot like Cooks Illustrated.Frankly, I like to read what WORKS, not what didn't, then finally, what did.Since one of her goals was to make things ""simple"", it is very hard to know that the recipe calls for something because it works, or it's just the thing you can find at an average supermarket.I want this to be a comment. It's not going to turn off everyone.But if you'd rather read an Alton Brown book than Cooks Illustrated, this may not be an ideal book for you."
1,chili,i made the recipe rotisserie chicken chilli with hominy & chiles.it was the worst recipe i have ever made.we gave it to two of our neighbors and they also did not like it and threw it out. it was not that cheap to make. we tried it for our super bowl festivities and thank goodness we did. i would have been very embarrassed to have served it.we are known in the area for being better than average cooks.people are always asking us for our recipes.sincerely disapointed
3,More Musical Innovation From Bristol,"Third Eye Foundation(Matt Elliot) have produced another quite innovative and at times compelling c.d.Drum And Bass meets ambient-he has certainly toned down the raw spirit and harshness of previous recordings.The music is held together by some beautiful rhtyhm and vague inobtrusive samples.Some of the vocal samples are definitely middle eastern in origin.My favourite one is the choral sample on track 4-'Half A Tiger'.Track 5 'Lost' starts off with a really nice guitar ,he then gently adds in some haunting piano and to complete the musical masterpiece some Ute Lemper style Weimar vocals.For me it is 10 mins.55 secs. of brilliant music that the rest of the c.d. never quite recaptures.Still I think the c.d. is worth investigating for the musically adventurous.P.S. the c.d. also has a track which must win this years award for best song title,track 1 'I've Lost That Loving Feline'-whatever it's about I just don't know?"
3,Received them beaten up,"I usually buy this product directly from the store and not online. When I opened the bottle the vitamins seemed kind of broken up and not as ""fresh"" as when I buy them directly from the pet store. Now that I've used almost all of the vitamins and can see the bottom of the bottle, there's a lot of powdered vitamin at the bottom. Seems either it was a very rough shipment or these weren't stored properly before I received them."
5,Although I don't eat these...,"I haven't eaten any of these, but we have 2 finiky Maltese males that just go crazy over these things.We were very surpised to see the little dog push the bigger one to get at these tabs.They love em and that makes our life abit easier.Buy'em your dogs will love'em.I qtr 2 of them and do a reward treat type thing every day in the morning."
2,No O-Ring Available,"The sump on this product has an o-ring larger than other big blue sumps. Unbelievably, neither Amazon nor Purenex have a replacement o-ring. Since periodicaly this o-ring needs to be replaced, the idea of not having an original replacement o-ring isabsurd."
2,A tale of ten O-rings,"Purenex asked me not to review this until they could make amends.It's been months now,so I'll share my experienceThis arrived with no instructions,I've had 30 years experience in the piping industry,what could go wrong?The specs say 1"" IPS in and out,they neglect to say it is a non tapered pipe thread.So a trip to the hardware store to find a solution,there I found a ten pack of O-rings that worked.The bracket took a little thought,but became obvious.In the process of removing the filter housing,I got a little wet,so I had to drill and tap for a pet cock for draining the filter.Of course another trip to the hardware store.I'm really not sure if it filters my well water yet,I think it has improved some.For the price,it's O.K.,but a little bit of instruction could have made this a one day job,but it took much longer.The filter I was replacing came with adapters and installation sheet,these folks should have also.I did find another use for an O-ring,so some good came of it."
2,Beat to heck,"I'm not in a position to rate performance yet, but good grief it was beat all to heck. About a third of the threads on the plastic housing was broken off. It looks like it was run over by a truck."
4,Enjoyable account of this Civil War battle,"This book offers the reader a well researched and presented account of the Battle of Belmont, the first battle in the Western Theatre and one of the first battles fought by Ulysses S. Grant. The book covers Grants attack on the Southern forces under the command of Leonidas Polk and Gideon Pillow at Belmont on the Mississippi River in Missouri on the 7th of November 1861. The maps in the book are easy to understand and guide the reader through the fighting, the narrative runs smoothly and offers a good overview of this battle. There is extensive notes and bibliography to assist the reader with further studies. Overall a decent book covering this battle of the American Civil War. An enjoyable read."
3,Close...,"I actually bought this bag to replace a similar one I bought at an army surplus store. The color is more tan than this, which was disappointing, and the metal piece on the strap is too lose, so I had to put a knot in the strap where I wanted it, other than that its a great bag."
1,NOT VINTAGE!!!!! This is a reproduction!!!!!!!!,"I feel like this was misrepresented NOWHERE does this state that this is vintage STYLED or a reproduction. This is NOT a true vintage military medic bag. I did like the look of it but it is a wimpy flaccid bad. not made of the rugged thick canvas that true medic bags are made with, nor does it have the sturdy stitching. Unhappy with how this is sort of a bait and switch sale."
3,a present,"This item was a present for a friend. We expect it bigger, howevwe our friend love it. So it was a success purchase."
3,too expensive,Total cost including shipping makes it worthwhile driving to a store nearby and just buying there.
3,Good but not great,I purchased this paper based on the reviews that led me to believe it is far superior to other thinner papers. The exact letter size is an important consideration one that I wouldn't have known without the knowledge of these reviews.However beside that I wouldn't consider this paper superior to others I have used. If you need noticably heavier paper try the 20#.
4,Good quality paper,This is good quality paper for what you're paying for it. It's not at all flimsy and the lines are dark enough so that it doesn't have a faded look. Easy to write on.
4,Runs well,"I've had the HP DeskJet 5150 for a couple of years, and it runs very well as a plug and play device in my Linux system. The black and white printing is sharp, and the colors and vibrant.This printer replaces an earlier HP deskjet that died on us. I am hopeful this one will last longer. But the price was right.I would agree with other reviewers who find the paper tray too short. It is also somewhat temperamental, and requires careful placement of relatively small paper stacks. In other words, it's not an industrial strength printer.It's a good machine. I recommend this printer to all those needing a sharp, clean printer, for not a lot of cash.Oh yeah, and it works with Linux!"
1,Dissapointed with Deskjet 5150,"After approximately a year after purchasing my Deskjet 5150 I started receiving error messages for ""unknown printer cartridges"" even though the cartridges were genuine factor HP cartridges. Reinstalling the cartridges made the messages go away the first couple times, but the third time all power seemed to be cut off, which the HP customer service blamed on the defective (HP) power cord. This is my second HP printer that has given me problems, and it will be my last HP purchase."
2,Not a fan of this printer!,"Maybe I have just had really amazing printers in the past, but we just got this printer at work and I hate it, as does everyone I work with! It is slower than slow, even with adjusting the printing speed to a lesser quality selection. I had to print out 30 copies of something with a very simple table (3 columns, no rows) and it took 30 mintues to print out these 30 copies! Furthermore, the way the tray is set up for the printed pages, it cannot hold the paper so the paper is constantly falling all over the floor. Thus, I can't just print something and forget about it, I have to sit there and pick the pages off of the floor as they come out because the tray will only hold about 3 pages before they fall.The only good thing I can say about this printer is that the picture quality is decent, but not great. My advice: skip this printer!"
2,No USB Cable,"Yeah, I don't even know if this is a good printer yet, because I have to go out and buy a USB cable to use it!!! Those guys over at HP should have the decency to give us a USB cord..."
4,Great Value,"I read some of the other reviews before purchasing this printer. I must agree for under $100 this is a great value! I previously owned a Deskjet 3320 which came free with my pc. I print greeting cards a lot and was very disappointed with the way the 3320 printed the envelopes. This 5150 printer does a great job on card envelopes as well as business envelopes. I even ordered the photo cartridge and was very impressed with the quality of the pictures. This 5150 is quieter, faster and doesn't take up much room. I'd definitely recommend this printer for those that are looking for a lot with a small price tag."
5,Wow What a Printer,This is one fine Printer and it works very well on Mac OSX 10.3.2 Panther. It is Fast and works well and I would tell all Mac Users to get this Printer it well worth the price.
4,I loved it so much i got another one.,"and another one. I have had this printer for several years. My sister bought one and my brother bought one too. we all still have our printers and love them. We buy bulk or remanufactured inks at great dscounts. Am hoping to upgrade to an all in one with an lcd screen, but still scared it won't be this good. I print photos all the time, people cannot believe i printed at home. of course u have to learn how to work with your printer and get the right paper. but once u get it wow the quality is great"
4,"Fit perfect, look nice and great price","Great price, name brand click and ship. love this site. we tell everyone I know. thanks for making it easy."
4,Best shoes for $50,after a week I can tell they are very sturdy a will last awhile. A little stiff but break in after a week or two.
2,"Dockers Men's Gordon Cap Toe Oxford,Black,12 W US","I was not very satisified with the condition the shoes arrived. Yes, they were new but I thik they were blems as there is a couple of spots on the leather that look bubbly. If I was at a store I would not have purchsaed these shoes. This is my 4th pair as I love this shoe but this is the 1st time I ordered them online and I am very disapointed. Never again will I order shoes online."
4,Decent workshoes for those that have to dress up a little but are on their feet a lot,"At age 56 my feet have started to let me know that they are not big fans of my Italian dress shoes. Now that I am on my feet most of the day I need a comfortable yet business looking pair of shoes. These fit the bill but are not perfect.They look like what they are, a relatively inexpensive ""Dockers"" product. They don't have a shine on them, more like a dull, matte-like finish that can get scuffed easily. Still, they look okay and are much more comfortable that my high-priced dress shoes. I bought the black pair and will get one in brown as well. If I get a year out of them I will be very pleased."
2,Diminished Quality,"I owned 2 pairs of these shoes previous to my current pair. This pair, like its predecessors is comfortable, once broken in. However, the workmanship seems to have diminished. They colapsed after 3 months use. It turns out that the heels are hollow. I'm sad to change from a shoe that had been working for me, but I expect more than 3 months wear, even from what was a $50 pair of shoes."
4,"Great fitting, solid shoe","Looking for a replacement for a 3-year old pair of Docker's oxfords, I wanted to get something with a little better fit and sturdiness. Finding this pair, I got just what I was looking for. I had to order a wider width due to the fact that this shoe runs a bit more narrow than others. After getting the fit corrected, I've been very happy with the comfort and finish that these shoes offer. Durability and longevity opinions will have to be added at a later date, but so far so good."
3,"Cheap, you get what you pay for","The shoe looks fine in appearance. The quality is severely lacking however. The heel is not a solid piece, and cracks in the heel wedge develop quickly. ..I have a pair of dress shoes from High School that I've worn intermittently (I'm 26) that stood the test of time better than this pair did over 2 months of light use (less than 2 miles of walking per day).It is a good buy if you work in an office that doesn't allow tennis shoes, and you can leave this at your desk and change into them in the morning. Otherwise, look elsewhere because while this is a cheap pair of shoes, having it last 2 months is not viable for how often you have to replace them throughout the year. You'd be much better off buying a more expensive pair that you don't have to replace as often."
4,"nice shoe, but","Good looking shoe, however runs rather small. 11.5W was a little tight on my husbands foot. But they should stretch out i hope"
4,Nice shoe,Great casual and semi-dress shoe. Wouldn't buy it for formal wear. Good with a nice pair of khakis. Very sturdy and nice burgundy color!
3,Good shoe not great,"I like the shoe it is a solid and well made, the leather could be a better quality. This is a good buy, I would look at some other options if you can but again I buy all my stuff on Amazon because I am over seas in the military."
4,There is always a but...,"I like these, but I found the sole to be a bit thick for my liking. They are a little clunky looking to be worn with a suit."
4,Comfortable Shoe,My husband said this was a comfortable shoe--especially in the heel. Very well cushioned. It's also a very nice looking dress shoe.
4,Well satisfied,I had purchased this same shoe at a local dept store about 3 years ago and was well satisfied and so thought I would buy the same shoe in a different color. If you're old school like myself and like to put a 'spit shine' on some of your shoes you'll like it.
2,Beware. Not in the same class as 75-100$ shoes.,Just realize you're buying a 40$ pair of shoes. Not something of good quality at a low price.
2,doesn't fit me,"I was excited to get these but when I tried them on I was very disappointed. The size doesn't fit me. Returned them right away, but still only got partial credit on reimbursement!! I guess that will teach me to buy shoes without trying them on first!"
1,Dockers shoes,I purchased these shoes based on the Dockers name. I never got to wear them because even though they were marked size 14 they were so small that I couldn't even get them on. They looked nice and I was looking forward to wearing them but it wasn't to be.
5,Work like they should,"Decent dress shoes that I use for work. At the $45 dollars I picked them up at I would say it was a great buy considering most dress shoes tend to be much more. I found these to be very comfortable and formal enough for my work environment. Despite the daily wear and tear I put them through they have survived so far, although the wear does show on the seams and laces; however, I would think that amount of wear is to be expected with the amount of use they get. One surprise to me though was that the rubber sole of the shoe began to become unglued from the shoe after a few months use but I was able to fix it with shoe goo. After that I have not had any problems. Anyway I have had the shoes for just under a year and I am pretty satisfied (all that probably just needs to be done is change the laces)."
1,Junk,"This is a poorly made shoe. I expect shoes to last more than a few weeks before they disintegrate. The sole separated from the shoe, the padding inside the shoe kept sliding around, and there were threads hanging out of the seams on the shoe. Three major defects in one shoe. It was rather cheap, though."
2,Cordovan,I purchased the Cordovan. Walked about 30 ft around the house and the leather/finish where your feet bend already showed signs of extensive wear/cracking. This is not the normal breaking-in wear. I own other Dockers shoes and this never happened to them. The order was returned to Amazon as defective.
4,confortable but narrow at the toes with little give.,"The shoes have a good finish with very comfortable soul.Unfortunately, due to its narrow design, the shoes does not provide much comfort for long walks and usage. It needs to have a little more room to expand at the toes."
1,Wrong all around,"The shoes were the wrong color and were marked incorrectly. The shoes are tight. If you wear a medium, you will need to order a wide. And if you do order, stick to plain black or brown. There appear to be problems in the Dockers' pipe-line, probably caused by using overseas workers."
2,Narrow cap toe,Be carefull when buying that shoes. they are very narrow. Order at least one size bigger than your actual size. Quality is acceptable but not good.
1,"I love them, except......","I actually love these shoes, but was disappointed. The first day of wearing the shoes, I had to remove the left shoe and remove 3 nail that we sticking into my heal.I had to pull back the insole and remove the 3 nails that were protruding thru the insole and into my heal, so I could make it thru the day. The only reason I didn't return them is b/c I pulled the nails thru from the inside and figured you wouldn't take them back.I would be happy to return them to you if you send me another pair....."
2,Not what they once were.,Owned dockers premium oxford shoes that were bought outside of Amazon and really loved them and thought these were those. They were not the same and they seem to be made cheaper now.
3,Good looking shoe but size runs small,"Purchased a pair of these for work based on other reviews. Actually ordered a 1/2 size larger than what I usually wear and ordered a EE width as I usually find them more comfortable. In spite of this they are very snug in the toe area. Took them to a local shoe repair shop and had them stretched. They are now wearable, but still a tad snug.Look to be decent quality.Update after 5 months of use. - Uppers on the cap toe are not holding up as well as expected. Lowered rating from 4 to 3 star. Would still probably purchase again, but a bit disappointed that they are showing wear so quickly. I polish them at least weekly with good quality polish."
3,Shoes were too small,This shoe proved to be way to small. In other brands my husband takes a size 12 but he could not get this shoe on at all.
4,Comfy once broken in,"These shoes are wonderful to wear. A great fit, stylish and easy to maintain.The only drawback was the break in process, which took about two weeks to become comfortable.Overall, I would certainly buy more Docker's online."
5,Excellent casual work shoe,"These shoes look great and feel great. They are super comfortable and perfect for wearing to work daily. They feel great on your feet, Dockers did an excellent job with these shoes. They also aren't too expensive which is great."
4,Good shoe,"Nothing spectacular. It's a pretty good shoe that is comfortable and looks decent. The front end is slightly bulky, but it seems to be something that no one but me will ever notice."
5,Excellent Shoe,"I only wore Havana Joes for several years but had trouble finding my size and favorite model. I did not believe I could find a a shoe that could match the quality and service of my Havana Joes but the Dockers Gordon Cap Toe hits the mark! It is an excellent shoe I have no problem recommending - looks great, feels great, and so far, holds up well."
5,Great Shoes,My husband is very picky when it comes to his shoes. He loves these and wants me to get the exact same ones every time he needs new dress shoes.
5,Comfortable & Durable Dress Shoe - Best Deal Out There,"I have purchased several brands of mid-priced dress shoe over the last several years. This one (Dockers - Gordon) is both the most comfortable & the most durable of the bunch. The only dress shoe that I would consider wearing outside of work hours, most dress shoes are really rough to walk in. I am buying another pair in brown and another in black. These are great."
5,Great shoes,"These are great shoes, with perfect fit, and a great price. Ordering online couldn't be easier."
3,"Great shoe, sizing appears off","I love the shoes; nice looking and comfortable. Unfortunately, the size 10.5 shoes I ordered are too small for my feet. I even went to a shoe store and sure enough, I am still a 10.5. My other size 10.5 shoes fit fine. I did get a pair of 10.5 shoes from LL Bean which were also small. I think I will give these shoes to the salvation army and shy away from ordering shoes online. I am curious to know if others found these shoes too small."
2,Too Tight,"My dress shoe size and regular shoe size is 8.5. But these shows were WAY too tight, and not just too short, but too narrow. Had to return them. But they looked really nice."
1,Worst Shoes I've Ever Owned,I bought these shoes in July 2012. Fast forward to August and the shoes were badly scuffed and the entire sole had separated from the shoe. I guess you get what you pay for.
3,Good but do have some issues,"I find these shoes to be really comfortable. I have been wearing them as my work shoe for close to 8 years, and probably have 6 pairs of the black. The leather is very durable, in fact even on my oldest pair the leather is still in very good shape. The reason I have gone through so many, is that for me the soles wear out rather quickly. With my walking/standing style, I seem to wear out the outside edge of the heels much quicker than the rest of the sole. All my old pairs have holes in the heel as the heel is not very thick in spots. I saw in another review that the shoestrings don't last and that is true. I've saved all my pairs and considered taking them to a shoe repair shop to see if I could have them resoled, because I do like the shoe, I just wish the sole would last longer for me."
5,Good quality,These are very good. Shipping was fast and size is accurate. They are comfortable to wear and look very good with dress up pants !
3,God's heart lost,"Erickson's book is well-written and includes a thorough explanation and evaluation of each of the eschatological views. He does a superb job at finding both strengths and weaknesses in each of the positions. However, I do believe he gets too caught up in the debate. This is a subject that is unclear and vague in Scripture. God gave us the information about it not so we could debate and argue over various positions, but to give us an urgency to spread His Word. The heart of God's message is lost in all the debates and disagreements. I am disappointed this book didn't give more focus on what is definitely going to happen in the end times and what God is saying to His church."
2,Pretty clunky,"This clip will do the job, but it wasn't quite as cute as I imagined it would be. The plastic clip to attach to clothing is rather clunky (it doesn't lie flat, it has an angled clip, almost like a clothespin or binder clip). It's not as subtle as I would have liked. Also, the ribbon is rather thin and feels cheap. And, in case it wasn't clear, the ""Green"" color is actually the duck clip shown; though there isn't any green to be seen, it should be called yellow or white. On the plus side, if you don't care as much about aesthetics, I do think the clip would attach securely to most fabrics and not cause any damage (I have found the teeth on some clips can pull at delicate fabrics). Also easy to attach one-handed."
3,Puzzling puzzles,"I loved Myst, it was beautiful and intuitive, not so much with Rhem2. You have to use a walk through to get anywhere with this game."
1,Parachute Coconut Oil,This product was expired one year ago. I would not recommend ordering from this company. Their product is old!
5,"great product, great service",NGK plugs are one of the best brands. I noticed a increase in mpg with these.Service was great with a great price and fast ship.
1,dated and completely unfunny,"I bought this CD because I loved Buddy Hackett on the Tonight Show and thought this would be something similar - him telling jokes in a nightclub back in the day. Instead, it is Buddy alone, in a studio, doing terrible bits with no punchlines, no laughs, no audience. Not only completely and totally unfunny, but the title bit is just one long routine of him doing a stereotypical Chinese accent.I'm literally tossing it in the trash, as there is no way I'll ever listen to it again."
3,Dissect Van Seect,"Corum's book is strongest in describing the comprehensive revamping of the German Military after World War I.It is historically weak in terms of missing the Polish leader Sikorski's role in the development of mobile warfare,and Corum could have done a more thorough analysis of the implications of Van Seect's doctrines.With the exception of an excellent evaluation of Van Seect's role in the Weimar German/Soviet relationship,much of the information on Van Seect was already available in Sikorski's ""Modern Warfare"", published in French in 1935"
3,Over-analyzed and very clinical...,"With a work as long and as rambling as Mahler's Second, you need a conductor whose vision of the work can keep you interested throughout. Gil Kaplan just doesn't seem to move me. His recording of this music seems over-analyzed and very clinical to the point of sterility. I much prefer the thunderous and heart-felt recording of Leonard Bernstein's CBS recording with the New York Philharmonic or Sir Solti's recording with the Chicago Symphony Orch. The price doesn't seem to live up to the expectation."
3,Not compatible with Oppo BDP-80,"Sound is fine & music is fine if a little idiosyncratic. However, I'm posting this review since I found the set consistently locks up my Oppo DBP-80 player in SACD mode. (See especially the transition from track 8 to 9 on disc 2.) Whether it's the disc's or the player's ""fault"" I couldn't say, except to note that no other of my SACDs have ever given any issues."
3,Cute comforter but cheaply made,"Overall I'm happy with this product only because my son loves it. However, the fabric is very rough and the filling is almost nonexistent. It is more of a bedspread than a comforter. I would have expected a better quality product for $40.00."
4,Cutest Thomas Print,I think this is the cutest Thomas Bedding print. The only one complaint that I have about this set is that it's very rough. I purchased the comforter and twin sheet set. I only washed the sheets and they still seem rough. They do not fit that well on a thick mattress but they are doing fine on my son's bed. I would recommend this set!
5,Christianity verses Islahm,I'm looking for any info to share with others so it is important to know whaere they are coming from.
2,sort of warped,"This addition to our track arrived boxed fine, no damage, but the ends were warped to the point that the train wasn't powerful enough to plow over the lips it created. They must have been stored in a hot warehouse. Its too bad because they make the ride more interesting than just the oval. Although I think my little guy would have just as much fun without this conversion. Keep your money and try it first without this addition."
3,Mom of 2 yr old,"Nice size track and child loves it. However, the track could be improved with groves so the it so the train doesn't slip as smooth plastic train wheels on smooth plactic track doesn't provide tracation. Make sure to open right away as I was missing a piece of track."
3,nixon,"I've been listening to this cd since it was released and to be quite honest, although there is a nice atmosphere throughout, the song's dont seem to go anywhere and all sound quite similar,its like the same song played 10 times but with diffrent instruments.better used as background music really."
1,Bought into the hype...,"...and regretted it. I can't remember the last time I bought a CD on spec that has pleased me less. Musically it nods to Luna and to Belle and Sebastian, but, unlike those paragons, it's utterly unmemorable melodically. Yes, there is a ""Philly Soul"" sound to it, but it's hard to imagine how a CD could in fact be less soulful: it's a cluttered, muddled, over-produced, over-orchestrated mess that dips into several genres without remotely succeeding in any one of them. On top of that, the singer is dreadful--if the toneless growl of his normal singing voice doesn't annoy you, the breathless, squeaky, off-key falsetto that he adopts for several tracks is sure to.The overall impression is of mid-tempo string-laden Alterna-Muzak, elevator-music for the pierced-eyebrow set. Mind-numbingly dull, resolutely banal. You've been warned."
1,Nixon is unlistenable.,"Here's my personal recipe for disaster.I hear Lambchop's ""up with people"" on the radio - the DJ recommends the album - I check out amazon reviews and they're favorable - I buy the album and listen to it; MY GOD,THE HORROR! I'm afraid I'll never get the strains of that miserable falsetto and backing orchestration out of my dome. Am I forever cursed to feel like I'm tooling down a grocery store aisle or poolside in Tucson playing a rousing game of shuffleboard? (...) Lambchop's Nixon is pleasant enough (I guess)and I definitely like 'up with people'. If you enjoy Yanni and Kenny G, are extremely stressed out and need a sedative or are just comatose Lambchop's Nixon may be right up your alley. (I'm O.K. you're O.K. right?).Here's some advice, if you have a pulse, think twice about buying Lambchop's ""Nixon""."
4,that lounge soul with strings thang,"Don't be fooled when Lambchop call themselves a ""country"" band. The twangy vocals and pedal-steel guitars are less evident than on ""What Another Man Spills."" What you have instead is a lush, gorgeous Philly-soul influenced groove thing, complete with Kurt Wagner's falsetto and a full string section on most tracks. And the audacious gospelly groove of ""Up With People"": a chorus (not unlike one that the actual Up With People might use), singing cheerfully, ""we are screwing / up our lives today!"" Modern day ensemble alterna-goulash at its best."
5,Nice cover,"Bought this for my new 13"" Macbook Pro. Very nice cover. Good looks and protection. Would buy again."
4,Wait for next version - No tsunami updated,"Despite all SE Asia - tsunami affected guides - say: ""you can update online"" you don't get lot of information on their website.Practically half of the areas detailed by this book is affected by the tsunami. The information is good, but not certain due to all the problems in the area. I've been in the andaman beaches and the guide was usefull, but I would wait for next version of this book. Lonely Planet Thailand (the next version, tsunami updated) is ready in august 2005, I think. So it's worth waiting..."
5,A Paradise awaiting the reader and the traveler,"I started reading Loney Planet years ago when I planned my trip to Thailand and have never been disappointed. I am an author and my memoir, soon to be released, takes place in Thailand in 1993. The beauty then and now has not changed in the outer islands. I would recommend anyone visiting Thailand to read this book first to get a feel of the country and its wonderful people.Dodie Cross, Author of A Broad Abroad in Thailand: An Expat's Misadventures in The Land of Smiles."
1,do not buy,"do not buy this product. it does not work.it makes the glue gummy and in our case, helped to spread it out making the floor even more sticky. our work is doubled!!aweful."
1,Worthless,I pulled up an old vinyl floor and scraped up most of the paper backing from floor.Purchased two quarts for a small kitchen floor. Followed directions but the productdid nothing to remove the glue. Vacuumed up what I could and washed the floor with TSP.I wouldn't take this product if they gave it to me. I should have believed the reviews.
1,Product Does Not Work,"I confirmed the product was intended to work the project I had in mind and followed the directions carefully. The result was more than disappointing. If it didn't have such a strong odor, I would have thought it was water -- it worked about as well. What a waste."
4,Exactly as expected,Tasty peppermint crunch candy - exactly what I was looking for! Perfect for white chocolate peppermint bark at Christmas time!
5,Terrific Retelling of Cinderella!,"I was really interested in this simple retelling of the Cinderella. It is more realistic than most Cinderella's and tells it with great style. In this version, the prince is writing in his diary. He spies Cinderella working and names here that name. She is the daughter of a gentleman who died and the stepmother and stepsisters don't treat her well. What happens is a more logical story than most."
2,Review of Prince Diary,"this one could have been better --- great idea for a book, but the story needed some oomph!"
5,Ages 4-8 will relish this new take on the Cinderella story,"Ages 4-8 will relish this new take on the Cinderella story, which comes from the Prince's viewpoint. Elizabeth Dulemba provides lovely drawings and kids will find plenty of embellishment on the story of a frustrated prince who finds all kinds of things wrong with women - until he meets a particularly elusive woman. Better cover art would have attracted initial attention, but the story itself is excellent and appealing."
5,A charming fable recommended for young readers on the verge of making the transition from picture books to chapter books,"The Prince's Diary by Renee Ting is a picturebook retelling of the classic Cinderella - from the Prince's point of view! ""Dear Diary, I have fallen in love with the most beautiful girl, but I don't even know her name!"" the prince writes, one lovelorn day. He must devise a way to search the land for his one true love. The Prince's Diary lets the reader know what the prince was really thinking when he met Cinderella's stepsisters, and offers a ""behind-the-scenes"" twist on a timeless fairytale. Each two-page spread features an exuberant color illustration by Elizabeth O. Dulemba on the left and the prince's story on the right. The Prince's Diary is a charming fable especially recommended for young readers on the verge of making the transition from picture books to chapter books."
3,"Good for starting, but not much more.","I bought this as a starting point for learning oils. And while the kit got me going, I quickly learned enough about oil supplies to where if I could do it all again, I may have chosen differently. The paints come in 12ml tubes(1/3 of the size of standard studio tubs) and in my experience were much drier than other oils I have purchased which made them alot harder to work with. I've also since changed out the palette, palette knife(the included plastic is bad) and many of the brushes. The included easel is VERY nice as is the tote.All in all, if you are looking to try oils, I think this is a great starting point at a good price(just get some linseed oil for the paints). Just expect to want to swap some stuff out as you go along."
4,Pretty good beginner set,The setup is pretty good for the people just starting out. The easel is really nice.
4,Not worth price,"The easel is the only good item in the whole lot. I'm not a painter but it doesnt take more than common sense to see that the brushes, paint, paint board and canvas are junk"
5,Oil Paint & Easel Art Set,I bought this for my niece in college. It arrived very quickly and is ideal for use in her college dorm. The desktop easel is perfect and she was thrilled with the carrying case. I couldn't have picked a better gift for her. Thanks!
4,Pink kitty,The lining is a little thin but durable and it's a bit bigger than I expected but big purses are popular. I can fit my Mac Air inside while in it's neoprene case.
3,Elmo Lincoln returns again as Tarzan,"Perhaps the highlight of the 10 chapter series is the prequel. The program begins with an eight minute summery of the original 1918 film, ""Tarzan of the Apes."" It's the best quality image I've ever seen and wish they could have included the entire film.Elmo Lincoln returned for this final serial and you can see that he had gained some weight since 1918. Still, he's as strong as ever as you watch him pull himself up the rope arm over arm while Jane's holding on.Lots of real wild animals and cliffhangers, with sound effects that sometimes are helpful, but not always."
1,Bootleg alert,"I just received this double disc set from Amazon.com. What I ordered was the legitimate release from Hermitage Hill Media. What I got was a bootleg from an outfit called Serial Squadron. It is a shoddy DVDr knock-off, a pixilated mess bumped down to a DVD5, the title printed on a sub par blank DVDr. I didn't buy this from some shady amazon.com seller - this came from Amazon.com. It is a counterfeit, and their return policy is that they will only exchange it for the same item. This ends my business dealings with Amazon.com. If I want crappy bootlegs, I can get them on eBay."
2,Cheaply built,These were much more cheaply built than other toy handcuffs I have seen. Still fine for play but there are better choices out there for the same money.
3,It is what it says.... a childrens toy.,Good safety feature.. has a little catch that allows you to open it without the key. My son likes it.
1,These are really cheap...,There is no box that comes with this as alluded to in the photo. They are very cheaply made. My son will probably break them. I'm disappointed in the quality.
3,Good novelty gift,"The handcuffs are flimsy and not terribly well made. These were given as a gag gift and so it didn't matter much, but it would have been nice if they were slightly sturdier."
1,Cheaply Made. Broken within first week,"My 6 yr old son bought these with his allowance and they broke within a week of infrequent play. He was bummed. Pretty flimsy particularly where the chains connect to the cuffs. It's the location of highest stress yet all that holds them together are two pieces of soft thin sheet metal in the cuff and only a single rivet far away from the chain's attachment. A slight bend in the cuff's sheet metal (easily done), the chain falls out, and Dad has yet another thing to try to fix."
3,Title of book,"Just looking at the title, I am curious why it was chosen. There was no Abraham Lincoln Brigade in the Spanish Civil War. It was the Abraham Lincoln Battalion which was part of the XV International Brigades. John C. Howell, johnchowell@msn.com"
5,An exciting book,"I can't think when a new decorating book excited me as much as this one. I buy a lot of decorating books, but New Classic Style is so chic yet so helpful all at the same time. The premise, which is carried out stylishly by the photos, involves mixing classic furnishings from all eras and genres to create ""personal"" style. The book is so what I'm all about and what I see my friends doing. I've never seen a book on how to create your own mix before."
3,Could have had better choices for decorating ideas.,I was looking for more ideas that mixed traditional with modern. This book had some pictures and some information but I felt it was lacking somehow. It also seemed to focus more on the modern sparsely accessorized style of design. If you are a minimalist this may be for you. I was hoping to see more traditional styles and more ideas in general.
2,Great Sound Not Sound Design...,"I've had these headphones for less than a year and the sound quality has been great. However the design of the headphones is subpar. The earpieces seem abnormally weighty which you'll notice after wearing them for a few hours. The padding on the earpieces will shift over time as well because they're simply attached with double stick tape.As if all that wasn't bad enough, the dual bars that go over your head with the separate head rest are all very flexible to the point of being flimsy. Given the weight of the earpieces any rough handling can see these headphones break. This factor alone probably doesn't bode well for the frustrated gamer who wants to throw off their headphones.The included microphone? It couldn't have been more pathetic. It's small and in my limited use (stopped working in 30 days) was largely ineffective. So the only decent aspect of this pricey headset combo was the sound it's too bad they couldn't have made it more sturdy and lighter as well."
4,Not to bad,This headset is so far the best one ive had. The sound comes through clearly and the mic works fine. The only problem ive come across with this headset is that the mic doesnt work in some of my games such as TF2 or CoD4. But over all a good headset
2,Dated,"Really dated, or should I say, antiquated Harlequin with a hysterical virgin and a smug, snobby millionaire who goes around saying such whoppers like 'Your sex likes a certain amount of force' to the heroine.(Pg.63)I wanted to punch the hero in the face numerous times. The heroine wasnt any better since she was about as smart as a pile of hair, which is what she basically was."
5,LOVE THIS PACK!!!!,"THIS IS THE LEAST EXPENSIVE PACK THAT I OWN AND MY ALL TIME FAVORITE. I TAKE IT WITH ME EVERY CHANCE I GET. TOTALLY WATERTIGHT AND RUGGED LIGHT WEIGHT MATERIAL. WHEN ITS ALL PACKED AND READY TO GO, TRAP SOME AIR IN IT BEFORE SEALING THE TOP. THIS MAKES FOR A COMFORTABLE BACKPACK THAT CONTOURS TO THE SHAPE OF YOUR BODY. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT."
2,Great Toy - SHORT BATTERY LIFE,I bought one of each of these microids for my 3 boys. They love them and played with them a lot. The battery life is only 40 MINUTES. They take 4 LR44 hearing aid batteries which cost $2.99 each. So the toy itself cost $7.99 but to replace the batteries it cost me $12! and the kids could only play for about an hour!
2,Fake quantity good product,"It says you'll get 12 binders, and when then the mailman comes along and gives you a huge box you get all excited and take it to your room. When you open it you find tons of plastic packing air pillows and ONE BINDER hurried underneath all that junk. That one binder was in great condition and very sturdy but it was still falsely advertised as 12. So I called up Toolfetch and some guy picks up the phone and says that it was all Amazon's fault and mummbles they'll do something but nothing gets done, so now I'm stuck with ONE binder that cost $13, and I bet it's too late to return it too b/c it's been 3 months.Pros: really really good binderCon: only one binder comes NOT 12Advice: If u wanted 12 binders don't bother but if u wanna take a risk and see what happens be my guest. Or just go to costco and get them cheaper with free shipping b/c u picked them up yourelf."
5,FAtal Flaw,This was the first time reading a Ginna Gray book and I must say it was 'a can't put down' book. I literally was up til 5am reading. The first chapter had me hooked with it's high pace and errie feel. Then the warmth of the characters and the mystery of the plot kept a fast pace enjoyable flow. I found the good Dr. Mark the perfect male lead any womans ideal man for the most part and Casey's wit facinating. The mystery I found was a bit to easy to figure out but none the less I was shocked I was right. I will read it again and will buy more of Ginna's books. A must have for any romance/mystery fan.
3,"The ""Fatal Flaw"" is the predictability of the end!","This book started out very exciting, but you soon figure out who the murderer is! The rest of the book keeps a fast pace, and the romance is fun. No surprises, however, (even the revelation that Cassie learns about her husband), but it still is a fast paced, pleasant read!"
1,"Good points, but the end result, bad news","I read the book, then found out that the author died after writing it - how saddening that was. Yes, I have to give credit where credit is due - a lot of good points were brought out, but I've since found other books on healing methods that aren't damaging to the body that are more current with better info and the authors are alive and well after using their own advice."
4,Aeromax Jr Fire Fighter Suit,The suit initially arrived with no helmet. Amazon was absolutely terrific in their turnaround time and return process was seamless. They even sent a complete new item before we returned the one without the helmet. This is excellent quality and will get a lot of use between halloween and dress up!
4,Very cute...worth the money.,"My son loved this. It looks fairly realistic compared to all the other fire fighter costumes that I looked at. And it has no plastic or vinyl running thru it....all fabric. It runs a little big and is a little darker than tan. More like a deep beige. But all in all still worth the money. My son put it on as soon as it was dropped off and hasn't taken it off yet. :) Fast shipping, reasonable and packed nicely."
3,"Very cute, but some problems","This firesuit is very cute and seems to be very durable as far as the material is concerned. Our problem is that we sent back the first one because the button to the overall part fell off the first day we used it. Unfortunately, the replacement one we got did the same thing. We decided to fix it ourselves instead of dealing with sending it back.It is a very fun dress up suit, I just wish the buttons were more durable."
5,So authentic!,"I purchased this costume for my son, and he loves to wear it all the time. We have received so many compliments, especially from several fire fighters who have told me the costume is the most authentic looking fireman's costume they've ever seen. This costume is sturdy and will stand up to years of imaginative play!"
4,Fire Fighter Costume,"This costume looks terrific, it looks like a real fire fighter costume. I bought this for my sons 3rd Birthday and it says that it is a size 2/3 T. I tried it on him and it was to small. He weighs 29.5 lbs and is 38 inches tall. He could hardly bend his elbows or knees and was uncomfortable. I think this costume runs small and would probably be better for a young 2 yr old. The quality though was unbeleiveable."
4,Fireman Costume,"After reading some reviews on similar products, I decided on this one and I am very happy with it. The quality of the fabric and durability of the overall outfit is great. My son loved it when he saw it. I know he will be able to play in this for a long time. The costumes sold in stores this time of year are really, really cheap compared to this. It was well worth the extra dollars!"
4,"Beautiful costume, great quality","I bought this for my 3 year old son (Halloween 2011) and we've had it for over a year now. He got so many compliments on it while we were out trick-or-treating - it really is an exceptional costume. He still plays with it regularly even though he is starting to grow out of it. The only 2 cons to this costume: the elastic suspenders are very hard to adjust, and the velcro on the jacket always gets stuck to the reflective material and causes it to snag. My son certainly doesn't care, but it bothers me a bit that the costume doesn't look quite as nice as it used to. It would be helpful if it was possible to cover each piece exposed velcro when it goes into the washing machine."
4,Almost the reel thing?,"This fireman's suit is close to the real thing and quality is very good. The sizing is a little big, but gives you enough room to grow. This is a great product."
5,Playing Fire Chief,"My grandson, William, got this for Christmas and loves to play Fire Chief. His greatgrandfather was a fire chief and he thinks that it is fun to pretend. He loves it and it is quite authentic looking. It is very durable looking and I think that he will have it for a long time to play pretend fire chief."
4,unhappy customer,I do not like the fact that I spent over $50.00 on this product and did not get everything that was supposed to come with it. The costume was supposed to also have a helmet with it and it was missing. I wish it was easier to contact the seller throught amazon.com
5,My Son and I LOVE this costume.,"Great Quality. My son was thrilled and got many complements for Halloween. Expensive, maybe, but there is nothing close to this in quality and detail."
5,High quality,We purchased one of these for our son and one for his little sister about a year and a half ago. They are very high quality. I have had to wash both of them several times and they still look like new! (I don't dry them) My son (four) is able to put the outfit on by himself. It is a little hard for him to get off because of the buckles on the jacket. The one I purchased for my daughter (two) only had velcro so she could easily get the jacket on and off. Great purchase I am sure we will be buying at least one more of these as they are outgrowing them.
5,Excellent Costume,Very sturdy and authentic looking costume and my 3 year old loved it. I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a fire fighter costume. Only complaint was that the seller never replied to my email regarding the shipping status but I was happy to receive it in just over a week.
3,"Cool costume, but zipper broke","This costume appeared to be of very high quality when I received it. My son loved all the latches, straps, and zippers, which made it seem really authentic. However, the zipper split apart and broke the second time he wore it, before he even had a chance to wear it for Halloween! Luckily the latches on the jacket held it together well enough to wear, but don't expect this product to last."
5,Best fire suit ever!!!,"This fire suit is very well made! We bought this for Halloween, but reviewers mentioned its great quality to use year round. Now my 3 yr old puts out ""fires"" (waters trees) in the backyard with the garden hose and wears this to the grocery store with Dad on Saturdays. I am very pleased with how sturdy this fire suit is. I've never seen a stronger fire suit in any store."
4,Super product; bad zipper,"The suit is awesome, great quality for a little tyke. Our one problem -- and we are contacting the dealer about this -- is that the zipper had a flaw, minor problem but needed to be addressed."
3,Fire fighter costume,We are really happy with it except the zipper broke within a few days luckily it has metal clasps and my son is ok with it. We bought a cheaper one for my older son the zipper still works
5,Satisfied,"My son hasn't taken the costume of he loves it so much. He wears it playing in the neighborhood, to school, church and the grocery store."
5,Best! Worth Every Penny,Best! Worth Every Penny! My son plays in this suit several times a week for the last year and it still looks brand new. Everyone always asks where we got it. I will continue to buy bigger sizes as he grows out of it!
3,Zipper broke in 1 week,Looks great and my 6 year old loved it BUT the zipper to the jacket broke in less than 1 week. Aside from that its a decent product and probably better than most out there.
5,Great Quality,"This costume is very well made and definitely worth the money. My son has worn it every day since he received it and I imgaine he will wear it until well after Halloween. The detail is great as this costume is very similar to my husband's fire uniform, it even has the thumb holes to keep the sleeves down when wearing gloves. Perfect!"
5,Realistic fire fighter suit,We are very impressed with the quality and detail of this fire fighter costume. I purchased a size larger to allow for growing room but does not have as much room as expected.
5,Very Heavy Duty!!,"Originally, I was a little hesitant to spend this much money on a Halloween costume but to my surprise it was very good quality. The fabric is thick. The helmet is plastic, but it is thick as well. This is something my son will be able to wear multiple times for play as well. I am confident that it will last long enough for his younger brother to use it as well."
5,GREAT Costume!,"My son received so many compliments on this costume. The materials used were top-notch, and it's warm, which is very important in the great state of Minnesota! It ran big, so he'll be wearing it again this year."
2,Fireman Suit,"We bought this suit for our daughter for our 9/11 fundraiser we had last week. We went by the sizes, weight and she usually uses a size 12, so we bought the 12-14 size. The weight on this went 35 pounds over what she is, and this suit was too small. Go atleast one size larger than what says will fit your child. Its a durable nice suit, and is made to last. This will be going to my nephew for Halloween!"
5,Awesome!,"This is a very, very well-made costume. My son loves it!! My only regret is I wish I would've bought this brand for my first (in size 2-4), however, I spent a little less and my first one didn't hold up for every day wearings. Hence, I needed to buy another one (this one) for my second. AWESOME suit!"
4,A look at Brando,Interesting biography of a complicated personality and talented actor.No new facts are presented by the author but information is presented in a sympathetic way.
2,Sno-Line,"This is a ""B"" movie, at best. But it was filmed in Beaumont, Texas, and several local sights and people are in it, including the late John Henry ""Bones"" Nobles and radio personality Gary Lee Love. It is an interesting movie if you are from the Beaumont area. Vince Edwards of ""Ben Casey"" fame, is the lead. Local school teacher Carolyn Linscomb, who plays a short scene as a housewife, has the most beautiful smile in the world."
3,Weak effort,"Don't get me wrong, individually, I love the vast majority of the work both of these artists produce. It just feels to me that these traks were leftovers... or that it was just thrown together just to make some cash. There is really no emotion; nothing to identify with. All of their other releases are much better, in my opinion. It was a cute idea, but poorly executed."
2,A Shining Head on the World,"Most bald men are hampered by their inability to perceive themselves without hair, this book, written by an eager hairdresser, combats that problem, by attempting to address issues of self esteem. Since I am neither bald, nor go to a hairdresser, the book held little interest for me."
3,"Interesting, but flawed","Two of my students and I have been using this book this year for an independent study project. We have found the material quite fascinating and we have learned a lot. The material is well-organized and, as we approach the last chapter, it becomes clear what the authors' overarching theme was.The exercises range from trivial to challenging. We skipped most of the projects, but it seems like they are quite challenging as well.However, the book is full of typographical errors, many of them significant. This has been an unending source of frustration for us. Nothing is more aggravating than to spend an hour trying to prove some statement that turns out to be false as written, only to find out that there is a missing factor or minus sign. Chapter 11 alone has at least 9 such errors among its 18 pages.So I recommend this book if you are interested in learning more about integrals, but be prepared to check every statement and do not assume the book is correct."
5,I really like these,"We installed 2 of these on an Chevy LQ9 (6L) along with Hooker Headers and the sound, in my opinion, is finally just right. I can pick my kids up at school without looking like an idiot yet it sounds very serious and turns some heads when I really get on the gas. Thanks Magnaflow!"
2,Not Impressed!,"I did not find this book to be very helpful at all. Although it did explain the exercises, I would have also liked it to include a picture of each movement as well."
5,Good training info!,"What a nice, concise guide to shaping up the legs. Logical sequence and good exercises are given throughout the book."
3,Back to Basics,I loved this book when you want to get back to basics this is the best book to read. It reminds you how to build your leg work outs from a basic foundation
5,Let's go diving!,"At last, a practical SCUBA how-to book that makes sense to the average diver (particularly female divers) and is fun to read. A real confidence builder. Coleman thoroughly reviews the important basics as well as includes information from real life experiences that can change a so-so dive into a wow! dive. It's like sitting poolside with an experienced dive guru and having every dive-related question you can think of answered in simplistic and understandable terms. Although this book is geared toward the certified diver, I believe anyone considering a sport diving certification should also read it in order to gain a realistic understanding of the dive adventures that await her. I'm compelled to load up the dive gear, grab my dive buddy by the hair (if only he had some) and drag him to the nearest body of water."
5,Certified Diver's Handbook,"One of the most useful, informative publications I have ever seen on the subject of scuba diving. Coleman has packed a lot of extremely useful stuff into one place. This book is mandatory for all new divers and useful for divers of all experience levels."
4,Good book on diving,Good book. I read it and decided right away that diving was not for me.It saved me a lot of money
5,Now get out there and dive!!,"Very helpful book! Covers everything not covered in your OW certification class, and then some. Clay Coleman is a life-long diver who wraps up all of his knowledge and helpful hints in ""The Certified Divers Handbook"". Topics include equipment (what works and what doesn't), what to expect on that first dive trip, how to strike out on your own (can't find a dive buddy), important weather conditions, staying out of trouble, dive sites in the U.S and internationally, and much more. His style of writing keeps you reading and laughing at the same time. I find myself referring back to this book frequently as I continue to gain diving experience (primarily for his helpful tips/hints on all topics), and I consider it invaluable. If a newly certified or ""fantasy"" diver (one that talks the talk but rarely ever actually gets wet) is going to buy one book, this should be it. You will be educated, motivated, and ready to hit the water!"
4,Good for new divers,"As suggested by the title, the author provides solid information for just certified divers. For people with a few years of scuba experience much of the book will be useless.Also the book represents just one man's opinion. I prefer to go online to a scuba forum and ask my questions there, which usually yields the a variety of answers and the most up-to-date information.If you have the chance, I suggest you skim through the book before buying."
2,very upset,"the idiots who put this book together placed a segment of 35 pages in upside down and backwards.... who lets that kind of mistake pass thru quality control. there was no info on my invoice like a number to call or a place to email to complain and return the book. This book was under the description as ""NEW."" Very upset with Amazon lately."
3,"Brief, but interesting introduction to Woolf's life","I had never read anything by Virginia Woolf, but saw this short book in the store and thought it would be a good introduction. Since I am not acquainted with her, the brevity of the book encouraged me to take a chance. After reading about her life & the various stages during which she wrote her books, I am more encouraged to pick up one of her works.Nigel Nicolson obviously has an admiration for Virginia Woolf, as she was one of his mother's lovers, and a family friend, but I believe the tone of the book to be fair. He frankly discusses her shortcomings and her highlights. I would recommend this for anyone interested in learning more about thsi influential artist. It would be an excellent read for a high school literature class that is looking for the person behind the name of Virginia Woolf."
5,A Must read for anyone wanting to know about Ms Woolf,"This is really a great book, written with such love from a man who truly knew Ms Woolf.If you want to know about Ms Woolf I highly recommend this book."
1,JUNK,"One Word, JUNK! I bought these to replace a true Xenon Bulb that had a ballast go bad. A new Ballast was 3 times as much as these but after installing them, the ballast would have been a better investment. The product claims to be Xenon white. I've had stock halogens that were whiter, and it was no where close to the 6000k Xenons I had replaced with these. It also claims to be 80/100 watts and for off road uses only. Completely false, although they shouldn't be street legal because you'd do better with a couple maglites taped to your hood. I now bought another set of true Xenon bulbs with ballasts (6000k pure White). Don't waste your money on these thinking you'll get some great set of bulbs because you won't."
3,Not as bright as advertised,"Per description, these should be so bright it is like daylight. They are NOT that bright, in fact, not visibly brighter than standard head lights. I even bought new head light housings thinking that the lens was poor. At least the on line price was reasonable, in the local stores they are $50 and up."
2,YELLOW no better than regular halogen lights,These are not WHITE as advertised I bought hi pro for the car and these for our truck. the difference is literally night and day. these being night. I had normal everyday lights in the truck before and they gave off more light than these. I will NEVER buy these again. I have in fact taken a picture on my phone so I can make sure I never do this again.
2,not to happy,Not to happy with lights kind of dull not to bright I would of thought 100/80 watts would look better then stock.
1,Not at all what I expected,"Normally Hella lights are top of the line, however, not the case here. Even though they are higher wattage and supposed to be ""Xenon White Light"" they actually put out less light and it was blue."
1,Worst ever,"When I tried these I was amazed...and not in a good way! They put out maybe 1/2 (at most) of the light of my 2-year old OEM bulbs; in fact, I really couldn't safely see to drive at all, so stopped and put back in the OEM bulbs and made it on to work much safer. I then went to Autozone and bought a pair of Sylvania's best. What a difference! That's the bulb to use. I wouldn't recommend these things even for any type of auxillary lights; you can do much better."
2,Not very romantic,"I figured the story line would be pretty political, but since the authors state they write romance stories I thought I would give it a try. The story itself was interesting, but the romance was lacking. I was not even sure if(or when) Carlo and Brian fell in love. Sure there was sex and plenty of conflict, but where was the romance? I wasn't even sure I liked Carlo. There was too much spent on the political side of the story and not enough on developing the love between the main characters. Also, the sex scenes were lacking, the guys first time together wasn't even written into the story! If you are looking for a great action story with two hot guys and lots of love and romance, I highly reccommend S. Hardy Brondos books Perfect Trust and Perfect Hope at waywardbooks.com, you will not be disappointed."
3,Nothing personal,The political point of view was more important then the relationship. All of an sudden the characters made up seems more to do that we have 5 pages to the end of the book then a catalyst between the 2 characters.
3,Normal pan..,"I rate it with 3 stars because is not thick as i want it to be, but otherwise, great pan."
1,Handle broke off within a few weeks,The handle fell off within two weeks while cleaning it. Cheap construction and not worth a dollar. Don't waste your money on the pan.
3,Buy with caution.,"While the lid is great, I have had this pan now for several months. It is the one pan my dad now refuses to use. It doesn't clean very well, and the handles became loose. The handle loose meant a burning plastic smell when I put it on the stove. There were three people in my house using it.So overall this is good for low-key wear and tear, but I would go with something better for next time."
4,deception ridge,"I thought this movie was excellent! T think it was a made-for-TV movie, but for the genre it was great. I found it to be an exciting thrill ride, even in it's slightly hokey plot. I like Linda Purl in her character, and the rest of the acting was pretty good! I wonder why this has never been on DVD? I would snap it up in a heartbeat!"
4,Extremely Epic,"I would just like to point out this isn't just a review of just Vol. 3 but of the series in general. Gunbuster2 is a Super Robot Space Opera that later was the inspiration to Gurren Lagann. It plays up many of the stereotypical mecha elements in most anime and exaggerates it to the max, and it works! The Juxtaposition of the two heroines gives right amount of character development that breaks up the action. Fans of the original series will notice a lot of references from the first series and will not be disappointed.The only reason why I have to give it a 4 out of 5 would be the that this brand only hold two episodes per disc. I must also point out that for the casual anime fan, be warned that the series (along with the original) was never domestically dubbed for English audiences so subtitles are a must.Overall it's a must have for any hardcore Gainax fan."
3,"Unfortunately, there's no lazy way to learn German!","This book really will not help you learn German. I speak fluent German and bought it as a fun reference for my teaching library, but I would not recommend it to anyone who is trying to learn the language without help. It also touches on aspects of travel and culture, but in trying to be everything to everybody, it becomes a mish-mash of trivia. I would sum it up as ""cute"", but there are just some things that can't be done the lazy way."
2,"Okay, funny, but not for REAL German students.","I saw this book on the shelf of the library and I thought, Oh wow, this looks fun to read. So, I read through it, and lo and behold there was a mistake on the back cover! It says the word for dictionary, Woerterbuch, but it had it as Wuerterbuch. (that is, instead of an ""o"" with an umlaut, it had a ""u"" with an umlaut.) And of course, it had some funny tidbits on the sides of the pages, but nothing for the Real German learner. It was more for the tourist or business traveler."
2,Was a required text,"It really lacked, we didn't open the book once in my college Introduction to German class. It had some interesting/funny blurps, but it really didn't teach, it was like stereo instructions. Its too bad it turned out the way it did, it did have a nice style to it and may have been useful if it was written more with the beginner in mind. Not failing to mentioning the errors, trying to learn from it was impossible, too inconsistencies. But if you have a mind that can process stereo instructions, this book will definitely help.. just make sure you're studying it with a teacher that can correct mistakes in the book."
2,Good enough for work,"I was disappointed in the stitching quality of the coat. One of the cape straps was sown reversed so that the bottom stitches are up. Two of the buttons are misaligned. I will keep it for a work duster, but would not wear it out in public. Purchased another from another company for public wear."
4,Works - but _not_ in 21 days,"I think some kitties might be able to be trained in 21 days, but not all. The most important part of this book is praise and patience! I trained my three kitties but it took longer than 21 days, more like 2 months. If your kitties don't like it you have to go slower. I agree that this book could really use a web site or 800 number or _something_ for when you have questions. Maybe we should start a support group? :> Anyway, after reading how awful kitty litter is for cats (not to mention the environment) almost anything is better than changing the litter every day. Even occasional setbacks."
2,Didn't work for my cats.,"While this book is very detailed, well-researched, and well-illustrated, this toilet-training method just didn't work on my cats.I have two cats. Both are siamese, born on the same day about 15 months ago. They've lived their entire lives indoors in the company of people. Before we tried toilet-training them, they were perfectly box-trained. As soon as we started lifting the litter box up off the floor, cat poops began appearing on the floor now and then instead of in the box. We tried giving them a couple low steps to help them climb up to the box -- no help. We tried scouring the floor with all sorts of chemicals, sprinkled it with red pepper, we even covered it with a big potted plant and some cinder blocks. Each time we'd end up finding piles of poop between the obstacles.We ended up with a thoroughly stinky bathroom, a scraped-up floor, a dead plant (not much sunlight in the bathroom), and diappointment. (sigh) I guess you can't win 'em all."
3,"effective yes, but money saving no","I don't usually go in for the latest and greatest pet trends (raw diets, monogrammed sweaters, isoloation treatment, etc.), but after feeling that horrible kitty litter crunch under my feet for the umpteenth time, I decided that this was worth a try. Rosco (my Russian Blue) didn't take too well to it at first, but eventually he started to catch on. The pictures are very instructive and helpful, but a tad on the graphic side...not for young children, I would say. I was very excited at the prospect of saving some kitty litter cash...but I quickly gave up on that plan when I realized that the increased toilet paper usage was more than making up for any litter savings."
2,Never try to teach a pig to sing.,"There's an old saying: ""Never try to teach a pig to sing. It waists your time and annoys the pig."" Now replace pig with cat and sing with use the toilet. I spent nearly 2 months follwing the instructions in this book. First slowly bringing the litter box to the bathroom, raising it up to the toilet, and finally replacing the box on the toilet with kitty litter in plastic wrap. Now, I have a cat that hangs over the edge of her litter box so I though this would not be a leap. But kitty was not happy. The first day sans box she peed on the floor in front of the toilet. The second day she pooped. The thrid day she peed ON OUR BED! This, my friend, was a cat telling us she was not happy with the situation. So, the kitty box returned and we have had no further straying of toilet duties.The book is cute and entertaining. Maybe you have a cat that will use the toilet. Not me. Neither of our two cats used the toilet."
1,Failure,"This book said ANY cat could be toilet trained. They were wrong. I have 2 cats and both rebelled against the book (which I might add, I left in the bathroom in case they needed reading material while using the toilet). They went to the bathroom on the floor, in the bathtub, in the closet, pretty much anywhere BUT the toilet. It seemed like a good approach, but saying ANY cat can learn is a bit too general."
4,Works -- With a Little Ingenuity!,"My experience with the instructions provided in this book was successful! After reading a few of the reviews where readers expressed dissatisfaction with this product, I must emphasize this: Read the book IN ITS ENTIRETY, and the actual day to day instructions TWICE through, before starting!I can agree that there are times when support would be great, such as in the case of my 7 month old adolescent cat shredding the saran wrap stretched over the toilet bowl in the later sections of the steps. HOWEVER, substiting a light disposable plastic plate worked! Also, try to schedule the days that switch from the box to the saran wrap/plate method on a weekend or some other time where you can MONITOR your pet's progress, and avert any disasters!Have patience, a little common sense, and a smidge of ingenuity, and this book will free you from litter scooping, as promised!"
5,I was amazed!,"I was skeptical whether this book would work, but thought we would give it a try. Now, it's 21 days later, and NO MORE LITTER BOX! Great book!"
2,Great Idea...not that realistic,"Kudos to those that were able to potty train their cats. Even after months and months of practice, buying this book and the kits (not needed as part of this book, you'd make your own using an aluminum pan, etc.), my two furry friends are still using their litter box. Too many accidents made me change my mind about it. I'd recommend borrowing this book from the library and trying it out versus spending your money."
4,Great Idea,"The book was very clear and the steps are easy. My cats started off following right along, However I didn't follow the directions exactly & did have a set back. I'm looking forward to trying again & hopefull that it will work this time. I would advise anyone trying this method to make sure the rest of their house is clean though. If your cat does hit a point where they decide to resist the training, that fresh pile of clean laundry seems to be a favorite site for them to express their irritation at the new change to their lives."
4,Interesting book-,"It was fun to read, and I learned a lot about kitty litter and other tips about what cats do and don't like (even though I've had cats all my life!). I am at the final stages for my 2 7-month-old kittens, and one they get used to it, I will start on my two 9-year-olds. It's not as quick and easy in the last step as the author makes it sound, but I plan to keep trying! It will be worth it in the end."
2,Undecided,"Still working on the cat training. We did not follow the directions exactly and today I came home and my cats had gone to the bathroom on the bathroom rug and in their cat bed. We did not change out their scented litter gradually, we just changed it abruptly right before we put the training seat on the toilet. And we skipped from moving the litter box gradually on the toilet seat to just putting it on top of the toilet once we had gotten it up to the same level as the toilet. They were able to use the litter box on top of the toilet with no problem and even figured out that the new unscented litter was okay when it was in the litter box. But once we put the cat training seat on the toilet and removed the litter box they were totally confused and decided going to the bathroom on the floor was a better option I guess. So now we are going back and trying to gradually integrate the new unscented litter in with their scented litter and we will see if that makes a difference."
3,Worked for my cat but not natural,"This worked for me beautifully but I never thought about how the cat felt. I followed the directions to the letter and my cat followed along also.It was really odd to see my cat perched atop the people toilet seat, but to hear him tinkle in the bowl was really out there. He didn't seem to mind the tinkling but when it came to defecating he would not do it.He held out for days, I got so worried I put his liter box down and he immediately let go.I do not think it was right of me to try to make him do something that was not natural to him. He is a happy 21 y/o still healthy male cat that uses the litter box and is just fine now."
4,Angel-mania!!!,"This book was the first Angel book I read and I thought it was very good.It had mad fight scenes and good one-liners, it even had Wolfram and Hart!Ok,the story:Quake demons attack another tribe of demons called Serpentene.It turns out that the Quake demons are kidnapping people for a ritual and as usual Angel goes to stop them!the demons need people associated with the 4 elements:earth,water,fire,air.It is a great book for people who love the Angel crew.That's all from me.Hope my review helped!"
5,"""I cannot believe how good this book is ... Seriously!""","A usual du Maurier page-turner, in which she typically & savvily incorporates the ennui of the rich, the plight of the working class, the vestiges of war, the tensions between the sexes, the human need for meaningful work, the uncanny insight of children and animals, the history of the Occupation in WWII France (specifically), and god-knows-how-many-other-things in the service of a ""pick it up and read it at the beach"" entertaining yarn.AND: every chapter ends with a SURPRISE! (You know, like those old ""Hardy Boys"" books ... except they're LEGITIMATE surprises! No ""rip-offs"" or ""cheats""!)"
5,Is there a winner here?,"Never have I wished for a person with questionable values to be the winner or try to solve an unsolvable problem. It would be worse if there were not a child involved! No one should give away anything in this intriguing novel. As good as Rebecca, and I never heard of it until now. Start reading and you're hooked. I bet you don't put it down very often until you arrive at the final end. A great book club discussion!"
5,Great characters....didn't want to see it end,"I loved this book. The characters were fascinating and full of intricacies -- you loved them, you hated them, you were surprised by them. The pace, while I thought it was a little slow at first, became absolutely compelling. The daughter, seemingly so old for her years, was touching. My only wish would have been to know what de Gue actually did in London while John took his place instead of finding out at the end. Highly recommend reading it and her other works...Rebecca in particular."
3,I'd probably like it better after a second reading,"This was a well-written book but it lacked the fantastic eeriness of some of Daphne du Maurier's other works (Rebecca, The House on the Strand, The Flight of the Falcon). The concept was really good - two guys changing places. But this isn't a Prince and the Pauper change with mutual agreement. John is forced into it.For this reason this book is very interesting. Not one person notices the change except for one.I can't really say much about this book because it's been a while since I've read it and it didn't make the same impression on me as some of her other stuff. But it was good and as long as you are n't expecting something spooky to happen, you'll have a great time reading it."
5,FUN!,"this is a great little craft tool and i've had alot of fun with it. it gives me an excuse to sit down for a bit and watch some tv and ""knit"" !! thank you!"
5,Bloom Loom,"Love this loom, it makes the cutiest flowers. No problem learning how to make them. You just need the loom, yarn, large needle (included) and scissors."
3,Bloom Loom,"The Bloom Loom itself is okay. I was not satisfied with the customer service with the product's provider, Jo-Ann.com. It was shipped late and there was no way to track the shipment. I had previously attempted to find this product at the actual store because the cost of shipment is double the cost of the Loom itself. Unfortunately, the store does not carry it and referred me back to the website. Based on these experiences, I doubt I will be making any similar purchases from Jo-Ann.com via Amazon."
1,Thanks For Nothing Columbia...,"I'm glad there's alot of fans for this cool little horror flick who are just as pissed off as I am about""the new score"" What brainiac at Columbia (Sony) pictures thought this was a good plan.It's bad enough Columbia threw together some nickel & dime 'new"" cover art.I guess it wasn't enough, you had to ruin this long awaited classic on Dvd. Words cannot describe the anger about this,we waited for this title to come out on disc for years just so some clown could screw it up. If there's a petition going to that wonderful company Columbia Pictures, I want my name on it. We need to get a hold of the people who scored the original version of this movie. To me not listing the fact that the soundtrack was changed is false advertising.."
4,The SCREAM of its day!,"Okay, so I really enjoyed the SCREAM movies, but upon seeing this movie again (and again, and again...) I have to conclude Kevin Williamson REALLY ripped this off. The ""plot-revelations"" at the end of SCREAM are identical to this conclusion here, though HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME truly caught me off guard with its ending! As for SCREAM 2, it's exactly what I always though a HAPPY BIRTHDAY sequel would be... hmmm.A fantastic entry in the slasher sub-genre, HAPPY BIRTHDAY utilizes a more thoughtful plot than others of its day, keeps the murders gory and shocking and manages to accomplish what many other slashers didn't... scare the audience. Melissa Sue Anderson is a wonderful heroine and the rest of the cast is fun and likeable, while at the same time mysterious and dark. ANYONE could be the killer... and don't always believe what you're seeing! So how about that sequel?"
1,Columbia destroys a classic horror film!!,"Just finished the DVD of this 1980 slasher classic, and, as mentioned in previous posts, Columbia's lame-brained decision to alter the ENTIRE soundtrack completely compromises the tension, pace, and feel of this once-wonderful thriller. Only the closing credit song remains the same. From the putrid opening dance-ditty (played even throughout the first murder sequence!) to the mind-numbingly awful soundtrack changes during the dance sequence and ALL the murder scenes, this plays like an entirely different--and bad--movie. And let's not get started on that terribly inept DVD cover art...why not stick with the brilliant original shish-kebab art (here it is found as an insert)? Do yourself and your fellow horror fans a favor and skip buying this DVD: it'll be something audiences could never forgive, and a lesson Columbia should never be allowed to forget."
4,mighty fine,"though this album is not extremely innervating, it contains sweet solid action throughout. the track ""kilgore trout"" is pretty gnarly being heard for the first time (listen to the entirety of the song, though). even the instrumental stuff is good, vaguely reminiscent of Mogwai at times"
5,In Top Ten List...,"This is too good to be true. The appleseed cast has far surpassed their last full length. Their new drummer Josh has a great style, filled with almost sometimes jazzy fills and with dry bells...its so creative. Forget 'emo' or 'post-hardcore.' These guys rock."
5,Canon Focusing Screen,Canon Focusing Screen EC-1D Crop LinesThie item was shipped very quickly and was a great price.
2,Useless,"I wanted a book that would show in detail how to do different styles. This book only contained a brief description on braids and cornrows. I also did not like the author recommending straighteners for kinky hair. I wanted a book on how to work with my daughter's natural hair, not on how to change it."
1,,"I was extremely dissatisfied with this book - it gave very few helpful ideas on how to care for ""kinky"" hair. It also called the very fine baby hair angel hair, as if hair that is not fine and soft is something other than that. I expected to have helpful ideas on how to keep my daughter's natural (thick and not straight) hair healthy and style it beautifully. In fact, I only learned how to chemically treat and straighten her hair. The only style recommened for thick and coarse hair were braids....as well, the book was not very comprehensive. I do not recommend this book."
1,Pity the trees that died for this book...,"The other reviews were right on target. I'll add: little substance, spelling/proofreading errors, unfocused photos, and very little useful information. I'm not impressed and I'm getting my money back. The only marginally useful part was the list of brand-name products and tools at the end. For a momma committed to my daughter's natural hair health, this book has way too much about chemical treatments.My most used references: It's All Good Hair (Michele N.K. Collision) and Kinki Kreations (Jena Renee Williams). This just isn't worth the shelf space on my bookshelves."
1,NOT What I am Looing For,"This book just gives information about pressing or perming kinky hair.It does not give alot of information on how to braid hair.I am looking for a book that can give me tons of information on braiding the hair,and different but cute,hairstyles on how to style natural hair.If you are looking for natural hairstyles then check out the magazine braids and beauty"
1,Not for me,This product was not what I expected. For me it was a waste of my money. Did not give me the insight on how to care for my child's hair.
3,this was good for people with long hair,this was good for people with long hair. So it was not very helpful to me..
2,Boy was I underwhelmed,"I expected more pictures not so many stories, they way it was presented it what a book about a hair needs, pictures"
2,Problem Print,"This book has several good points, however it was hard to keep focused due to bad printing. There were several pages with light print. This made it diffcult to follow the book. I know errors can happen, however it wouldn't hurt to have a preview staff on hand."
5,Wonderful,"I just finished reading your book and I loved it! I am a white mother with two beautiful biracial girls. I have tried so many methods and products over the past 5 years, but always with great hesitancy. This book to recommended great products, with helpful usage ideas. Thank you so much! I will be recommending this book to all of my friends with multi-racial, as well as African-American children."
1,Junk,This thing is junk. I connect it to a 10Mbit Ethernet network and it looses 5% of the packets. I am really disappointed. I can't believe this company is so popular. Second Linksys product I have returned..... and the tech support are so bad it's not funny.
1,Not Happy with the Product- WRT55AG,I bought WRT55AG a month ago. My main concern is with DHCP server and DDNS feaure.DHCP server won't serve the IP address until the router is reset.It happens very frequently.DDNS funcation is always disabled even if you provide all the setting for your DDNS provider.I contacted customer support 3-4 times but no luck. Customer service is not good.
1,garbage,Totally unreliable.Tech support is worse than useless.I will look elsewhere for all my networking needs from now on.This thing is garbage!!!
1,Poor Performer,"I bought this product expecting to get good performance on both the 802.11a and 802.11g radios simulataneously. Boy was I disappointed. Whenever I use my 802.11a laptop, the 802.11g radio range from my desktop machine suffers. How can Linksys really claim this to be a dual-band router? It does not perform as expected. I'll be returning it for a refund. SAVE YOUR MONEY UNTIL A GOOD PRODUCT IS AVAILABLE."
2,Buggy,"Bought unit when it first became available and it was immediately apparent that the DHCP server was unreliable. Linksys tech support acted as if I were insane, however. Then several months later came along a firmware update that, shock of shocks, stated in the release notes that it fixed a DHCP server that would cut out after 5 minutes.Now, the unit disconnects ALL 802.11b clients for 1-2 minutes every 5-60 minutes, and Linksys again is acting as if there is no problem. I've tried different channels and the other obvious solutions. I'm sure in a month or two (I write this in 12/2003) there will be a firmware update to solve THIS problem..."
2,Need to upgrade Firmware,"This is my second WRT55AG, the first one I send it back, because it was not wooking as it should. When the second arrive, I replace the firmware with the one they just release, so I don't know if the problem was releated or not to the fw.Linksys have not release yet the g compilant firmware, and the does not tell you when will that be.Linksys need to do a good job with the firmware, to make this product work as it supose to do it."
1,WRT55AG,"I purchased this with high hopes as well to be able to work downstairs without any problem. But I was wrong, the wireless did work well, but for some reason my husbands direct connect failed about every 2 weeks.The last time we called, they want us to send the product back, yet I don't think I want to go wireless, and stick with a direct connect. It seems safer and also much cheaper.I don't think I will go Linksys, so I see now that the most expensive isn't always the best."
1,"If this was a college project, Linksys would get a D.","First, the good. The wireless A is easy to set up and works better (stronger signal) than B/G.The bad. It really doesn't work as a router. It does not take static routing, is not forwarding ports and dumps about once per day requiring reboot. Updating to current firmware doesn't have a visible impact. Linksys customer support ranges from poor to nonexistent. The whole deal reminds me of a college project thrown together at the last minute before Spring break. If I had it to buy over again, I wouldn't."
1,I've returned it 3 times and still doesn't work,"they keep claiming they've fixed it, and still it disconnects all the time...and you can't get third part firmware fro dd-wrt for version 2, only version one. get a wrt54G instead"
3,"Good, but with a fatal flaw","I picked-up this router to replace my old Linksys wired router. It worked very well for both my wired computers and my wireless laptop. I got ""excellent"" or ""very good"" signal strength on the ""G"" network everywhere in my house. (I have no ""A"" devices, so I turned off that feature.)The problem occurred when I tried to VPN into my office. This router does not support NAT-T, which is required for the Nortel VPN system my office uses. The only solutions are to have the IT dept reconfigure the office's VPN (ain't happening) or switch to another router, such as the WRT54G."
2,Access Point,The router and switch functions work ok but get bogged down and the unit needs to be reset. The bad part is that it is not an access point as advertised.
1,BEWARE!,"I was so excited to get this that I paid extra to have it overnighted to me. What nobody told me is that this device doesn't send a signal more than thirty-five feet!!!!!! That's ridiculous. I called the company and they admitted that's the best the device will do -- 35 feet. I hate it. I had to buy a booster and boosters for every computer in the house, and even then the signal was really weak. I'm VERY disappointed. Buyer beware."
1,Great when it stays connected - too bad it rarely does that.,"I am never buying another Linksys product again. The Linksys support forums are full of people complaining about their routers, seems like pretty much all of them, disconnecting for no reason and they offer no help."
2,"Fast, But Has Bugs","When it is working right, it is fast. It also seems to have good range. Unfortunately I have to reset it a lot because it either:1) Stops talking to my computers2) Stops talking to the cable modemI never had these issues with my previous Netgear wireless router. Maybe there are some firmware upgrades that would help. I'm not sure..."
1,Wireless Access Point,"i m like to share the data of my own bussiness ,, i have 2 offices but the distance b/w 2 office is 5 kilo meter , so plz give me a suggestion what can i do for share the data b/w 2 offices.thanxi m waiting for ur responce"
1,WAP DHCP Problems,"Unit is garbage. Only works without security. As soon as you install wap, dhcp starts to flake out. Origially have firmware 1.2, linksys sent me new firware, after installing the new firmware, the device wouldnt come up. sent back to factory, received a new one with firmware 1.4. same problem. this think is junk if you need security."
5,Silent Superstar,"I've been using this Router for several months.Easy set-up.Provides broadband internet access for my desktop and laptop.Very stable ; has never been a system problem.Just one of those components that you install and forget.""Low"" signal in the most distant room in my large house,but it nevertheless functions reliably at that distance.Love it.BNB ><>"
1,avoid - completely unreliable,"Just read the other reviews... I echo everything said in the other 1 star reviews. Had a Linksys wireless B router which worked without incident with my Comcast broadband modem for more than a year. Bought this AG router when I simultaneously purchased a Linksys Media Center Extender.The router has been a complete nightmare. Completely unreliable connection to Comcast broadband internet service. Have even exchanged the original AG for another AG - same issues. Have been through power recylces, MAC cloning and firmware updates. Remains completely unreliable.I previously had a good impression of Linksys' products - no longer."
1,Avoid the wrt55ag at ALL COSTS,"This item is NOT ready. It dumps connection every 4-6 hours, sometimes requireing a cold boot. Tried beta firmware, was even worse.. Get a d-link, buffalo, whatever, avoid this router/wireless access like the plague."
2,Installed ok but went to heck.,I am having trouble with dropped signals on wired connections and wireless is a crap shoot. Sometimes it will hook up but most times it won't. Very unsatisfied with product. Amazon shipped fast and their part in this was great.
1,sucks,"the other reviews nailed it, this thing is totally unreliable i have to reset to factory defaults anytime i try to change any setting, finally i gave up and am sticking with the defaults which SUCK until i get this thing replaced with NetGear stuff... sheesh..."
3,"Wireless-A is useless in a home, use Wireless-G.","I bought the WRT55AG as a way of consolidating everything with wireless in my home. For the most part, I've found Wireless-A to be useless in my house. Its range drops off easily and the quality of signal fluctuates enough to make it useless to me. Thus, I use Wireless-G as my primary connection mechanism. It's generally been solid, though once every couple of weeks the router flakes out for no apparent reason and I have to power recycle the box.Were I to do this again, I would not bother with Wireless-A: it's more expensive and isn't particularly effective indoors. Except for the problem mentioned above, the box has been pretty stable, much more so than my experience the Siemens Speedstream (Wireless-B only) it replaced."
1,Apparently there are TWO Versions of WRT55AG,"My WRT55AG hardware version is as buggy as many others have noted, especially with WEP enabled. Even after upgrading to BIOS version 1.04 (30Jun2003), I have many connectivity and dropout issues over only a few feet. My research to fix this problem showed that Linksys now offers another WRT55AGver2. Note ""version2"" indicator. Version 2 uses a much more recent BIOS version 1.10 (11Nov2004). When I asked their tech suppport if I could upgrade my ""version 1"" hardware with the newer BIOS, they apologetically said that the two WRT55AG versions are not compatible. So I am obliged to buy another hardware router to get the benefits. Since then, my hardware version has disappeared from their support page.So my feeling is that the new version 2 hardware is winning awards and my old version 1 is heading for the trash. Not a lot of real information available from Linksys on this issue but it may explain why some users have problems and others don't."
1,"Horrible router, probably the worst produced today","Amazon did their portion, the seller did send the item faster (still slow by todays standards) than usual with any Amazon company. Do not buy this router, the other stories of poor connection quality on WIRED ports is true. Wireless is virtually worthless unless you configure a specific frequency to use, then it still drops regularly, even when sitting 2ft from the router. I thought I had upgraded from a D-Link, now I am back to using what works and am stuck with this pile of garbage and out the money. DO NOT BUY THIS ROUTER, THERE ARE BETTER AVAILABLE."
2,Over-rated,"I disagree with most of the others who reviewed this item. I thought the performance was without warmth or feeling. Perhaps Kaplan is so obsessed with this piece that he over-analyzed it to the point where he sucked all the life out of it. This is a very, very long work and it needs an imaginative and dynamic conductor to keep one's interest. This CD was also VERY expensive. My comparisons: Solti's recording with the Chicago Symphony and Bernstein's original New York Philharmonic version."
3,A highly polished vanity project,"I feel a bit forced into cynicism by the unabashed raves this performance is receiving here. An impassioned amateur conductor like Kpalan has to be really rich to hire the Vienna Philharmonic in pursuit of his hobby. The results are a bit embarrassing, insofar as a great orchestra has allowed its palm to be crossed with silver - and perhaps DG freely undertook the project fiven that Kaplan's first recording of the Mahler Second became a bestseller.But the musicians play scrupulously, if not exactly with fire. I doubt that Kaplan stood in their way, at least. He doesn't have great ideas about Mahler, just lots of detail and precision. But he isn't a professional musician, after all, and he has to be commended for pursuing his passion as far as it will take him."
2,Zzzz,"In this recording Kaplan has achieved a musical miracle: he made me go to sleep during a Mahler symphony. The DG sound is too bland (except for a bass that will give your sub a workout). And the performance lacks all the punch and insight that made Kaplan 1 the great recording that it was. It's slick, over-polished, and just plain dull. My advice: stay away from this one! By all means buy Kaplan 1 or either Bernstein (esp. 1), but give this record a pass."
4,a good relationships and life movie,if you dont mindalan alda ways of talk talk talk...thenthis can be a really fun movieeven for guys as well as dolls.start showing to kids over age 14 tooin todays worldthey will use this movie as a guide to lifelove and relationships...and what goes on in some busy head s...have fun
1,Rip Off Price,"This 2.5 oz bottle of wonderful Chanel AFTER SHAVE MOISTURIZER can be bought on Chanel's website, or Macy's, or Neimen Marcus for $46.00."
1,Ouchey Ouchey,Ouch! It really hurts to comb your hair with this implement. Maybe a sharpened rake would be better. Wow. I mean it.
3,Not so secrets of the Street,"The thesis of this book appears to be that Wall Street insiders have the ability to cheat and use it. His examples virtually always used anonymous people. I am a bond I-banker so little in here really surprised me and in many ways it became boring. An avid stock investor with no finance experience may find it titillating where I did not.I read the book hoping for interesting stories. There were a few like the female who had no problems using whatever tools were necessary. Otherwise, it was relatively bland. There are many other books on this subject more interesting."
2,"If you're looking for City Of The Walking Dead, get the Nightmare City DVD","I got this DVD because it contained City Of The Walking Dead. That is an alternate title for Nightmare City. This DVD does have 2 movies on 1 disc, BUT they're BOTH on the same side. This means the compression is super high and thus the quality is very low. What they should have done was create a flipper, with a movie on each side.As I said, I got this DVD for a specific movie, only to discover it's incomplete! The end continues past the ending credits with the ending theme playing over a black screen. Whoever did the authoring thought the black screen meant the end of the movie and did not watch the source material to compare and make sure he did it right. Thus, the ending theme ends abruptly as the DVD ends.So, I can't recommend this DVD over Nightmare City on DVD."
4,This Wind Cries Unmerrily,"This is a powerful story of survival and eventually escape from the jungle re-education camps of post-war Viet Nam.See, perhaps for the first time, the untold side of this tragic piece of history. Huynh's prose is precise and poetic, at times transcending the brutal realism of the story in order to reach the spiritual core that held him together through his experience.This is an important book for anyone who is interested in this time period, and more importantly, where we, the US and Viet Nam, will go from here."
2,Mating in Captivity: Unlocking Erotic Intelligence,Recommended by a Marriage and Family Therapist. It wasn't what I was hoping for. There weren't any solutions offered other than to loosen up and go with it. Really?? You have to be kidding me.
2,For Chicks Only,"I found little new in Esther Perel's ""Mating in Captivity."" The book, written from a strictly female perspective, emphasizes ways to keep a relationship physically fresh and thus emotionally intimate. Ms. Perel uses case studies from her own practice, as well as her personal philosophy, to drive home her point: women need to use their minds and bodies to keep their men. It's all been written before. I would have been much more interested if the book could have provided new insights regarding the culture of marriage, that is what it really means to ""mate in captivity,"" as the title suggests."
4,Some interesting perspectives on relationships,"This book breaks from the traditional ""better emotional intimacy means better sex"" and really tries to understand what prevents couples from having satisfying sexual relationships. One new perspective is that of how fidelity or lack thereof affects a couple's sex life. Definitely an interesting, thougt-provoking read."
3,Avoid the audio-book format,"I listen to a lot of audiobooks during my drive commute. I generally prefer that professional actors read their books, but some authors make good narrators. This one does not. She speaks English with a thick French accent that can sometimes be hard to follow (she is fluent in nine languages). Words like ""penchant"" come out ""punshunt."" The CD version is particularly irritating because it has about 6 tracks per CD of 10 minutes each instead of the more common short tracks of 1-2 minutes each. If you miss something, you have to listen to a lot of material you have already heard or just go on. I am not commenting on the quality of the author's ideas -- just that audio is not a good format to access them."
5,What every man needs to know about their wife,"Mating in Captivity: Unlocking Erotic IntelligenceEvery man who is married or may be soon needs to read this book. It is an extremely useful, well written, well thought out explanation of how to balance love and lust in a marrage. The authors conclusions are simple and brillant. Ms. Perel analyzes and discusses things no newly married person ever thinks will happen to him, her or both of them but it can and it usually does. My humble advice is empower yourself and be happy. Read this book. Raphael"
5,Awesome book!,"Every couple should read it. Esther Perel is a fantastic writer and the book made my wife and I rethink the way we were conducting our married life. Easy and fun. Again, I love it!"
5,Fantastic!,"Esther Perel is an awesome analyst and articulate, sensitive writer. She shares a practical and miraculously intuitive depth while exploring the stories of her coupled clients as they reveal and learn to overcome the common obstacles of intimacy while living the routine in a complicated world. A forefront reminder that engaging in a lifelong, soulful sex life is essential to overall physical and mental health. She makes the dilemmas, the indescribable twists and turns of relationship and the path to betterment and connection seem so obvious, we can learn to use these skills too. Love this one, possibly the most eye opening book of this kind I've ever read."
3,if your a women?,"If your a women, you will understand men a little more, if your a man you will nod your head. If you want to know why most marriages and relationships fail, read this book. Sex is not about numbers, your erotic life NEEDS a home to to come home to. To do that, this book explains that delicate balance of modern relationships and our political-correct views. I will read this agian in 1 year so I can focus on keeping my wife happy."
3,Very helpful for the beginner,"The first book I bought was for Visual InterDev Unleashed. What a nightmare. If you are just getting into InterDev stay away from that one untill you get a little understanding under your belt. I found Sam's to be very well done considering how confusing InterDev can be. I had a few problems with the tutorials, but for the most part, learned the basics, which is what I needed to begin to understand this software."
5,A great introduction to VisInterdev and ASP in general,"A great book. It provides you with concise explanations and step-by-step instructions on the basics of using Visual Interdev, as well as an introduction to ASP, ADO and SQL. Tom writes in a relaxed fashion that's easy to read and simple to follow, yet conveys a great deal of useful easily digested information."
5,"Clear, Concise and enjoyable",I bought the book 2 months ago to help me learn Interdev at my own pace. I found the book to be very helpful - just like the old 'paper' manuals used to be.Highly recommended - keep it with you while you're working and you can't go wrong.
2,Not very comprehensive,"This book skips a lot of stuff. I would recommend Practical Visual Interdev 6.0 by Amundsen, I've had better luck with it."
1,Little to offer for beginners or pros,"As an experienced developer looking to get a quick jump on a new ASP editor, I thought this book was the ticket. Unfortunately, the author couldn't decide to whom he was writing. One minute I'm bored with a ""hello world"" snippet, and the next I'm frustrated with a (too complex for a beginner) non-functioning scriplet. Visual Interdev has a lot of slick features, but this book did very little to emphasize them--too much time was spent introducing new concepts and technologies, and not enough time was spent on the guts of a great application. That being said, I would have rated this higher had the book at least done a good job introducing the aforementioned technologies--but it fell short in that, too. Spend a little more time, and read Visual Interdev Unleashed--great chapters on the data environment and the scripting object model, as well as some good reference material."
2,"Maybe I'm Missing something, but...","I was very disappointed with this book. Being already familiar with ASP and ADO, but never having used Visual InterDev (VID), I was looking for a book which would show me specifically how VID would benefit my application creation process. Instead, this book focused more on how to create ASP and ADO apps, and not really the advantages of VID itself. After working with this book and VID for several days, I still prefer Homesite.If you have never worked with either ASP or VID, then perhaps this book would be of benefit to you. But if you already know some ASP and just want to learn what VID can do for you, I should hope you can do better than this book.I'm a little surprised this book has received such high reviews. Again, maybe I'm just missing something... but I doubt it."
3,"Good info for an introduction, but tedious to read.","On a subject with few good books, this one covers the introductory bases fairly well. If Mr. Archer were speaking before a group, the text would sound right and be an enjoyable training session. Unfortunately, the casually embellished, narrative style is often tedious to understand, in the absence of vocal inflection. The last half of the book is better written than the first, but both suffer from the lack of nasty, aggressive editorial pruning. Result--knowlegeable and valuable content submerged in an overly long and tiresome manuscript. Most pages of text could have been easily reduced in length by 20%, with improved readability. This book's shortcommings lay squarely in the lap of the editor. Give me a red pen, quick!"
1,Misled.,"It's unclear where these high reviews are coming from! Having plowed through 3 chapters, not a single ""exercise"" has worked. The explanations are so poorly written that even with the assistance of a more experienced programmer, they defy following what the author is talking about. He says do this, do that, then don't forget to do this (all the while it's totally unclear why or what it is you're exactly doing)- then shazaam, it works! (Not). Then, there's nowhere to go. Just on to the next inevitably futile and discontiguous example. I think the reviewers who opined that the author/publisher was in a hurry are right on. Read it, it can't be followed with any form or manner of stepwise logic at all! How much help is that, 24 hours or not."
5,"With a doubt, the best book of its kind",I searched high and low (fully admitting that I am accustomed to shunning most 24 hour books) until I finally gave this book a try. Easily the best InterDev book currently available!
2,I'm not the target demographic,"Didn't realize this was mostly for women who recently gave birth. My child is 22, this book won't work for me. I'll probably donate it."
2,"Info is solid, but doesn't require a book","I think this is something like kegles - small isometric exercises that take time and dedication to see a difference. Also there is some information about being aware of your posture, movements and so forth in relation to using your core so as not to make the problem worse. Overall not that entertaining or helpful. Google or youtube repairing diastasis recti and you can find helpful exercises and advice in less time than reading this book."
2,Nahhh.....save your money,Not what I was expecting; read excerpts from the book before you buy it. Make sure it's what YOU are expecting.
2,Losing you mummy interest,This book has some good stuff in it and was easy to read. I just had trouble trying to follow exercise instructions out of a manual. I wish I would have ordered the video instead.
2,Advice from the author is to buy the DVD instead,"Hi, I started reading this book & had a question. So, I e-mailed the address found on the Tupler Technique website. I received a reply right away which I appreciate saying that this book was written in 2004 and all of the updated info is on the DVD. I requested a refund for the Kindle edition of the book I purchased & plan to buy the DVD instead. Wondering why they think it's a good idea to continue to sell this produce if the author herself doesn't even recommend it. Slightly annoyed but no harm done since I got my refund.**Update, after speaking with Julie again she let me know that she did offer to update the book for free but her publisher declined. So, I don't blame the company, just would recommend that someone looking to start this program buy the DVD instead of the book to start at least."
2,Not for beginners,"The author appears to be educated on the subject, however as I am someone with no yoga or pilates experience it was too hard for me to follow & understand the steps she's recommending. This book definitely needs a DVD to go along with it. It was too hard to hold the book, read step 1, understand step 1 and then do it to move onto step 2. If you are well trained in yoga/pilates then you might have an easier time with it, however I think this book would benefit ten-fold if it came with a DVD."
2,"BIG SNORE, NO SCORE",FOrget it. I am an ivy league grad who had a hardtime following this book. It is bland and boring.And so complicated--who has time to follow allof it.What a waste of money!
2,A frustrating waste of money!,"I exercise regularly, but found the instructions in this book difficult to follow, and the pictures were no help. I expected color pictures that matched the book cover, but the images inside the book are grainy photos of the author. Even with the pictures and instructions, I couldn't figure out some of the moves. So, I spent more money on the DVD and the recommended split. Huge waste of money! The DVD was more annoying than the book because the range of movements for the exercises is so small, it's really hard see what you should be doing."
2,Not Practical,"As a new mom, I am sleep deprived and time deprived. I want a book with clear directions, illustrations (photos are better), and a concise message. This was not that. Perhaps the DVD offered on the author's website would be a better choice, but I didn't want to spend the $30 or so for the chance. If you have the time, and are not keen on color photos/illustrations, and can make sense of her written instruction, maybe this would be ok."
2,Discouraging,"This book is more about what you CAN'T do or SHOULDN'T do with a diastasis: lots of advice about how doing xyz will make your problem worse. Don't twist this way, don't lift that, don't jackknife up in bed or you'll undo months of ab work. And the elusive ""Tupler technique"" is simply to activate the transverse abdominis muscle. For a more proactive perspective, and advice about what you CAN do to improve your diastasis, as well as strengthen your core, improve your posture and relieve back pain, I recommend __The Core Program__ by Peggy Brill."
1,Totally Useless,"I purchased this book along with the DVD and two splints. I followed through with two six week sessions, both times getting results only to undo everything just by lifting my kids. This advice is not practical- nobody thinks about holding in their stomach all day long. The splint is super uncomfortable and not practical for everyday use. Don't waste your money."
1,Not Very Practical,"While the concept of this book makes sense, application in the life of a mother doesn't. I have four children and can't possibly retrain myself to think only in terms of my stomach. Basically the author wants you to think about how you sit, stand, carry your baby, cough, sneeze, lie down, get up and that's on top of the daily excercise routine. As an added bonus, she tells you that one jacknife can undo weeks of work! I know that at 3 am if one of my children starts crying, I don't stop to think about how to properly get out of bed first. I'm just trying to quiet my child before all of the others are awake too. That's too much of a time investment for me to make just to mess it up with one mistake."
2,found this book hard to follow,"wasnt able to follow the exercises in this book, i imagine the dvd would be easier , it was some what informative but i am not sure if it was truly accurate. Also it seems like they were trying to sell their other products in the book."
4,works great,"Book arrived within time allotment, but got here kinda slow nonetheless, so it was kind of annoying, but it did get here, so I guess I can't complain too much! It's a great book. My mom has already noticed I'm ""slimming down"" and I have hardly done what the book recommends. It is hard work. Not just easy peasy, at least, in my opinion. But my tummy is looking better and back is a little stronger, so it must be working!"
2,Not what I expected.,This book was not what I thought it was. I thought it was going to give specific exercises that would help with the after baby pouch. I guess if you do this strange wrap around your waist as she explains and do these strange non exercise things it may work but I was not even sure where to begin after reading this book. Confused and not impressed. I guess I am not into this sort of alternative thing.
2,mummy tummy review,"Some of the exercises in this book were good but Tupler made a number of comments about the negative effects of some pilates exercises. The comments were inaccurate and showed that she had a very limited and incorrect understanding of that discipline. She commented that the Pilates hundred will cause diastasis of the abdominal muscles. When done correctly in a neutral pelvis this exercise will actually correct diastasis. It will only make it worse if it is practiced incorrectly. Her lack of knowledge on this subject, that she commented on over and over, really made me question her knowledge on everything else."
3,Great Photos,"This book has wonderful photos of all kinds of hats. However, it only contains instructions for making a few of them. I tried to make the Water Lily hat but found the instructions confusing and could not figure it out. However, if you are browing for hat embellishment suggestions or just want to look at nice photos to get ideas for hats the book is great."
3,"A ""FUN"" book for people with light interest in hats","I think this is a good ""recreational"" book to pick up in a craft of fabric store when you have a light interest in hats. I did not find it went in depth enough for people who really want to DO hats. I need more info on EMBELLISHING and STYLIZING hats. This was just too basic and broad to give me much actionable information."
3,OK,"Works well,diffcult to set time zones.Needs stand to stand up,lays flat,I keep thinking its a tv remote"
2,Not very accurate.,"Well made, but not very accurate. Even though the outside receiver was just on the other side of the wall from the main unit it still wouldnt hold the signal. Placing the outside receiver right next to the main unit should have shown temp and hunidity the same for inside and out. Temps were the same but the humidity readings were way off."
3,"okay, but not worth it.","__It's the Stupidity, Stupid__ is not a bad book. No, it's just fair. But at under 100 pages, I would save your money and wait for it in paperback... if it makes it to a second printing."
4,"Though (some) of humor loses me, valuable and informative.","If the question of why Clinton is hated SO strongly by some people has perplexed you, as it certainly has me, buy this book and do read it to the end. About half-way through, I had become a little irritated, with some of the humor just a little to clever for me to try to figure out, with a surfeit of (to me) unknown names, and with seemingly too little on the big question of whence the hatred. But be patient, for Shearer knows where he's headed after all, and the book fulfills the promise of its title before it's done. It's useful to know in advance that Shearer's index is more than just an index, with short commentary at each entry. Although the commentary is given in concise humor, less informed readers such as myself can get a little insight on unknown persons encountered in the text by referring to it as necessary. All in all, very worthwhile."
5,As smart and funny Clinton & Ken Starr put together,"Humorist Harry Shearer is a great writer who informs, amazes, teaches, and enrages, and does it all with the funniest, cleverest language of any writer today -- in the tradition of Robert Benchley. There's more genuine insight in this brief book than in a year of newspapers (or a decade of MSNBC). So clever, Harry. So smart. So write another, please. Gavin de Becker, Author The Gift of Fear"
4,"Slight, But Funny","A fairly funny commentary on the state of politics at the end of the Clinton era. Shearer attacks pretty much everyone, but no doubt Republican partisans will be offended anyway, they seem to get upset about any criticism of their leaders, no matter how tepid or humorous. Generally, this book will not make you laugh out loud, and you will not feel compelled to treasure it always, but it is a fun, easy read and provides plenty of amusing insights and comic asides. Of course, you might want to keep on your bookshelf just to make your Republican friends go beat red on the sight of it."
4,"hey, it's an imperfect world","Working on the assumption that most Clinton-haters reside in the south, Shearer offers up an interesting hypothesis to explain the anti-Clinton venom (he's a traitor to his class, to his sex and to his race) but this fails to explain why rich, white conservatives from other parts of the country seem to hate him as much as do the poor, white conservatives from the deep south that Shearer writes about here. He does veer off briefly into other plausible reasons, most notably the hate-drenched paranoia that propells the militia and white supremist movements, the current ""culture war"" between generations, and the belief some Americans have that politicians are directly responsible for the country's morality, but doesn't develop these as fully as he could have. Still, it's a fun book and will have you laughing outloud regardless of whether you like Clinton or merely tolerate him."
4,So Close...,"When I tried to describe the Delta 72's to friends I would say that 000 is a combination of James Brown and the Rolling Stones. A bold statement that isn't entirely true, but it was as close as I could get. The album is full of rock'n'roll energy.I saw the Delta 72's live in 2000 and I was amazed at how much they oozed rock'n'roll. They were rock'n'roll. They played at a small dive in front of 50 people and it was like watching the Stones or Guns'N'Roses. Still, something is lacking. They are searching for a voice, a distinction that is still eluding them. Once they find it though..."
3,Message from Japan,"IF you havent heard the Zoobombs yet it is well worth a Listen. Sure it is Japanese but they can teach a lesson to John Spencer and the Delta 72 about rock and roll. ""Welcome back Zoobombs"" is the album. Thrashing Guitars, hot organ with a sqeaky voiced japanese chick on backing vocals. It works.The Delta 72 sound good but I heard the Zoobombs first. It kinda pales in comparison."
5,It's all out of order!,"Elfquest is the best. However, I just want to post some info about the correct order to read this printing.Here's the page sequence if you get this edition. This series was 4, 28-page issues. This book has no page numberers.This Volume Orig.Comic,Orig. page#Pages 1-24 - Seige #1---->1-24Pages 25-49 - Seige #3---->1-28Pages 50-53 - Seige #4---->1-3Pages 54-57 - Seige #1---->25-28Pages 58-86 - Seige #2---->1-28Pages 87-End- Seige #4---->4-28The idea is that you want to read it following the sequence of the ""original comic"" column. I put sticky notes all over mine and found it possible to read this. Hope that helps."
3,WARNING!,Attention first time readers of Elfquest! This edition is COMPLETELY OUT OF ORDER!!!! It would be better to look around for the original copies of these issues.
3,Not the best little Valentine book.,"Overall, the stencils are nice enough, but I don't think it measures up to the sticker or vellum coloring books that this company offers for Valentine's Day. I just needed a 4th for the 4th kid."
1,Dismal unhistoric sequel,"1602 opened a new idea for the Marvel universe and re-examined a set of familiar characters in light of the end of the Elizabethan era.1604 sets up a comedy romp involving the Hulk, some dinosaurs and Iron Man as a steam engine. This is very silly and rather poor."
5,A Great Read For Marvel Fans,"After reading the first Marvel 1602, I knew that I had to pick this one up as well. If you enjoyed Marvel 1602, read this one as soon as you can!"
1,Don't waste your money...,This book was more like a bad term paper than an in-depth history of one of rock's most influential and exciting stars. Very disappointing.
2,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT NOT MUCH HERE TO ENJOY,"THE SHOW MUST GO ON is a quick and easy read. The author wrote the book not long after Freddies' death so maybe that explains the lack of detail or excitement in the book. The author makes statements that are not clearly supported and he mentions Freddie's friends in relative quick and minor detail. I didn't learn anything new about Freddie but maybe this information was all new back in the early 90's. I would have enjoyed more details about his life, especially his relationship with Mary Austin, who he called ""the love of his life."" Mary was his constant companion. They started as a couple and then Freddie came to terms with his homosexuality but faithful Mary was his friend to the very end. There is a tender and unusual relationship there.There is not much enthusiasm in the author's writing and this book lacks the depth that Freddies' life deserved. I'm going to search for a more thorough biography."
3,"Nice photos, but some information was questionable at best.","Mr. Sky left out many essential elements of Freddie's life - the book read like a tabloid. Better choices: Freddie Mercury: The Definitive Biography and Freddie Mercury: The Show Must Go On (not to be confused with Mr. Sky's work.) The International Queen Fan Club recommends Lesley-Anne Jones' ""Definitive Biography"" as the most accurate depiction of Freddie's life."
2,"A book that hinted, but never gave any real information","Though the book had some interesting pictures, the bulk of the text never offered anything new to the reader. In a biography of any kind, you want to learn more about the person than what you already know. This book does not offer that ideal, instead it paints Freddie Mercury in a light that is oft times confusing and inaccurate. Check a title called Mercury: King of Queen a better book, even if it is on the tabloid side of writing."
2,Keyless Drill Chuck Stiff and Off Center,Purchased this keyless chuck for my Delta Drill and to my chagrin and surprise it was not true. Lot of drill wobble. Also this unit was very stiff to open and close and just not comfortable to use. I have contacted VME to replace the unit - I will see if this is an annomoly or just a poorly designed chuck.
3,NOT complete!,"If this is indeed the track listing, then this CD is NOT the complete solo recordings (I don't actually own it)-Django also did a solo version of 'Tea for Two', which is on many other Django compilations, and can be heard here:[...]. . . Just thought it was important to note."
1,Rubbish,"I've had this scanner for over 3 years and I've never got a decent scan out of it. I've had to play around in Photoshop to make anything usable, but detail in never there. Everytime I scan I have to unplug it from the mains then replug it to restart it so that the software can find it. I've updated to all the latest software, but it never got any better. The default settings are unusable, the auto scan select never includes the whole image to be scanned so you have to delete it and do it manually again, it's just rubbish! So I'm here at Amazon looking for something better.Mac OS10 [[ASIN:B0000A01L1 HP ScanJet 8200 Digital Flatbed Scanner"
5,Relaxing,"I listen to this at night to help me sleep...it works. It's so peaceful, relaxing, I love it."
3,Buyer Beware!,"This book is a reproduction of a second edition of the original which was copyrighted in 1894. There is a disclaimer at the beginning of the book which warns that there may be ""occasional imperfections such as missing or blurred pages, poor pictures, errant marks, etc.""It does not tell you that every odd numbered page from 571 through 649 has been copied such that a significant portion of the left side of the righthand page is cut off. This flaw includes the index pages (two columns per page), rendering the index 25% unusable.The reproduction errors are egregious and inexcusable, and especially so in a book of this historical importance."
5,Why Do I Watch This?,"A obnoxiously, ovbious fake psychic who cracks cases the police can't solve themselves. Why do I keep watching this show? The main characters are obnoxious (a grown-up brat, a sidekick nerd, an emotionally inbound dad, and a jealous, do-gooder cop), the story lines are mildly creative, and yet I just can't stop watching. There's nothing GREAT about this show, but it's a feel-good comedy that can't help but make you want to slap the brat, kiss the nerd, hug the dad, and cross-your-fingers so the cop solves a case on his own just once. I bought it, I love it, but I still just don't know why."
2,"I don't ""get"" all these positive reviews","I saw that these DVDs received wonderful reviews so I ordered Seasons 1, 2 and 3 of Psych. Season 1 disappointed me. The actors have good comic timing and I love the fact that it's a ""family show"" that I can comfortably watch with my grandmother and my 9 year-old. But, it's just not a very good show. The humour is silly and within the first 10 minutes you can often figure out how the episode will end. Not recommended."
2,Just couldn't get into it,"If you like shows like Scrubs you'll probably like this - I watched the first few episodes and thought it was too over the top goofy and gimmicky. I also found the lead actor annoying. For someone looking for a great crime show with some humor I'd recommend Bones or The Closer, for crime drama it doesn't get better than Criminal Minds."
1,Funny? Mysterious? Nah! Pathetic!!,"The product description of Psych caused me to buy it. One problem I have is that I've seen too many really *good* cop shows, e.g., Homicide, Monk, Columbo etc., as well as too many really *good* comedy shows, e.g., Seinfeld, Cheers, etc. Psych tries to blend comedy and mystery -- an impossible creation since either one or the other fails. Psych manages to fail in *both*. The comedy is a childish, slap-stick type of humor which fails as comdy. The ""observations"" made (and magnified) by the protagonist are too brief for the DVD viewer to absorb and think about. All-in-all this series would probably be enjoyed by eight-year-olds and younger. If you are older than that, don't waste your time on it."
5,"A must have, I love it.","One of the best show to watch, love the extra features. It was a great way for my family to sit together and have a laugh."
2,Terminal Negativity,"The continual negativity of Gus the sidekick turned me off completely. The pilot was a test of patience, with the psych acting like the very worst TV psychic you have ever seen, and the sidekick being negative about Everything. The pilot plot was transparent - the main character acted like a fool while trying to hoodwink the police about his make-believe psychic skills. There is no chemistry between the psych and his buddy. Why does the psych want the sidekick to join him anyway? He adds nothing but negativity, and occasionally drives the psych around. Being around negativity like that would drain almost anybody, but apparently not the writers of this unfunny, uncreative mess."
4,Fantastic series!,"Absolutely one of the best detective shows out there! Sadly not released in Canada, so I was more or less forced to buy the series, and I'm not dissapointed! Terrific bonus features and includes fun deleted scenes!"
5,What more do you need?,"Psych is probably the funniest, wittiest show on TV.You want fun, you got it.You want suspense, you got it.You want romance, you got it.You want father-son relations, you got it.I don't think it lacks anything, even the chemistry between the cast, you will fall in Love with Shawn-Gus relation.I can't wait for Season 6."
3,WHY WIDE SCREEN ?,"I would agree that all of the PSYCH DVDs are great, its a great show. However - why the HELL are they done in WIDE SCREEN ??? THIS IS TERRIBLE. SHAME ON THE STUDIO."
4,I enjoyed it.,"I do not watch a lot of TV but this came on while the tv was running and I got into it. Then I had to go back and watch the other episodes.It is a fun show full of laughs! I can tell this season was not as good as the one I am currently watching but as with most shows it has to build up and work out the kinks. It is still great to see where the show came from. If you are just starting to watch the series, you may want to watch a later season and come back to season 1."
4,"Great, but where are the Psych outs","Great show, good DVDs but where are the psych outs, when the shows were originally broadcast they did cool little song snippets during the credits sung by the cast, very funny stuff, perfect thing to put on a dvd set... but they're not on here. otherwise a decent set, some deleted scenes and a couple of commentaries, just the lack of all the extras they could have put on here makes it feel kind of mediocre. this show deserves better."
5,"Funny, Quirky, and Well-worth the Price","This is a show not to be overlooked. It has a little bit of drama and a lot of humor!! Download one episode to get hooked, then buy the DVD collection."
2,CAN THE SAINT OF SEVEN DIALS PLOT DRAG ANYMORE?,"I really enjoyed the first in this series, the second one was a little too repetitive for me, but this one was too much. Noel is the third Saint of Seven Dials and hopefully the last (Unfortunately it's not). Does anyone else notice that this is the same storyline everytime with slightly different characters? I thought Rowenna was a strong woman and I might have enjoyed her in another story. Noel was a great secondary character, but I wasn't given enough about him to really care. Rowenna and Noel's romance was uninspiring and the plot tiring. I only finished it because I can't start a book without finishing it. Not sure what Hiatt was doing, but I'm ashamed to admit I read the next book just to see if she could redeem herself. NOPE"
3,Does not stick,"I love the border and the way it looks in my son's room however, it says on the package it is supposed to stick on the wall once it's wet. It had NO sticky stuff on the back whatsoever! We had to go buy paste from Lowe's to make it stick. So the label was a little misleading. But the end product is adorable and my son loves it!"
5,The bare truth of childhood: no sentiments no stereotypes,A wonderful film that depicts the complicated emotional turbulence of a foster child and the hypocrisy of the modern social system that can provide everything to such children but love.Maurice Pialat is a great director.
3,a dip inbetween happens?,"To enjoy the espisodes of Upstairs, Downstairs, One needs to begin with the first, which I didnot not, have seen some on TV. but since didnot follow on regular basis, this was a disappointment."
3,Midol worked fairly well. It didn't work any ...,"Midol worked fairly well. It didn't work any miracles, but it did relieve cramping and somewhat reduced bloating."
2,Head Vision System,The fit is very good but the glasses have a tendency to fall off your head with quick movement. The included head strap is very uncomfortable and leaves streaks on the glasses when wet. Would be much better if they had the arms like traditional glasses.The interchangable lenses are cool and the carrying case is top notch.
4,Excellent Indian Lounge & Trip Hop,"All too often, what purports to be ""Indian/South Asian"" lounge is just some soft noddling music or New Agey music with some sitars and tablas dropped in - and they call it a day.This however is a great collection of real Indian musicians or at least musicians who really appreciate and understand Indian music ... and of course, real lounge & trip hop music.About 50% of the CD are definitely cool, exotic lounge - about 50% of the tracks really fall under the definition of Indian trip hop and not really lounge. They are still excellent tracks and if your music horizons are broad - they are excellent Indian trip hop tracks - just be aware they are not all 'lounge or chill tracks.'The last two tracks are really New Age or old school ambient techno ... they don't hold up as well as the other tracks but overall, an excellent collection of world class tracks."
4,3rd times a charm... don't miss this one,"I got a copy of this off a coworker and it didn't strike me on first listen... though kept it around due to the names associated (Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Thievery Corporation et.al.). Through it on my ipod and over the next 6 weeks it would show up in my random shuffle and would rarely get skipped. It is now something that I actively go and turn on (versus just in the rotation) and has become a favorite. This is definitely in the same vein as the Outcaste Newbreed collections. Give it a go.."
4,Snook Doll,"This is a great doll for fans of Its a Big Big World. There aren't many toys out yet from the show, and I was so happy to find one. The doll is well constructed and soft enough to sleep with. The only down side is that the three phrases he says or sings are all played in a row. So that gets a little old. I would have been much happier if every time you pressed his belly he said something new. I also wish that the whole song played rather than just a phrase, that was the thing I was disappointed with. Overall, I'm so happy my son can hug his favorite TV character."
2,Time line is Off,"One problem is that the book is set in 1991. Checkpoint Charlie was opened up when Germany Reunited in Oct 1990. The book has East Germany as a sperate country and with Checkpoint Charlie fully active 1n 1991 which it wasn't. This is too basic of an error. The Wall fell in 1989 & the book is copyrighted 1990. Seems like it was written before the Berlin Wall fell.I've lived in Lahore, Pakistan and the landmarks descrivedare accruate."
3,So far so good,"Ordered 2 lights, one had a big chip on the rim, not worth the hassle to spend money to send back. They both light up. (but for how long I'm not sure) Outside box was not damaged, so the damage was done ""Before"" packaging it. Use caution when ordering. Good thing I ordered an extra one."
5,Great One Year Bible,"I purchased this bible a couple of months ago and have been very pleased with it. If you are looking for a way to read the bible in a year, and for a way to read it in chronological order (i.e. to read it in the order in which the events occurred), then this is a great option. I recommend it highly."
4,A refreshing way to study the Bible,"We bought the One Year Chronological Bible,NIV version along with the One Year Bible Companion. We are enjoying the Bible but the Bible companion is difficult to use because it isn't printed in chronological order. Maybe Tyndale Publishers would consider publishing a companion for the chronological version."
4,good book,"I like the way this bible is set up in the chronological order and more tradational, the NIV can be a little boring compared to NLT; however, I feel this version is a little too liberal in the translation."
4,great way to put it all together,"I bought this after out Pastor spoke about it at church. This is a great way to read the Bible in a year - already broken up into daily sections based on reading for 15-20minutes. This is not a regular Bible the content is rearranged from what you are use to reading to the order things actually happened, a great way to put it all together. I only wish I got it in the NLT instead of NIV - I got NIV cause that is what my Bible is, I heard someone read from the NLT and think it would make this version almost novel like. (Not that this version is bad in anyway)"
4,Easier to read,Seems to be easier to read and retain than the traditional Bible. Too soon for me make any other comments.
1,Disappointed,I am disappointed in this version because I feel that having to look in the back for timelines didn't flow and didn't help me to learn and remember.I wish the dates and approximate dates had been listed at the start of every chapter and paragraph. I really wanted to LEARN and I haven't.
5,New look for a great book!,"I am really enjoying reading the Bible chronolgically. The daily lessons are short enough to read in 10 to 15 minutes, and the page headers for each day help to explain why the editors choose the order. If you want to take on the challenge of reading the Bible in one year, this book is a great choice as it helps tie the whole Bible together more than the traditional Genesis thru Revelation layout.However, if you are looking to buy your first Bible or a Bible for use in church this is not the best choice, you should get a traditional Holy Bible. But for a structured reading plan of the Bible in one year book, this offers a interesting change than the traditional one year Bibles."
2,Doesn't Match Order of Print Edition,"I was very happy to see that the Kindle edition of this Bible was finally available...only to find that the order of daily readings did not match that of those in the print edition. How very inconvenient! I'm not concerned that this is the 2011 NIV, but it's pretty much useless for reading along with others in my family and at church who are using the print edition, so I returned it."
3,Not the Same as the Print Version,"I have the hardcover version of the One Year Chronological NIV Bible, and I have enjoyed using it as my primary Bible for personal devotions. I was very excited to finally see a Kindle version of this Bible because I like the convenience of being able to carry my library with me.I'm somewhat disappointed, however, to discover that the readings in the Kindle version are not in the same order as the print version. This is particularly noticeable when reading the Gospels. I noticed similar differences between the NLT and KJV versions of the One Year Chronological Bibles. I like the Kindle versions well enough, but they are simply not as well done as the original print versions.I would expect some differences between Bibles published by different publishing houses, but these three Bibles are all published by Zondervan. The order of readings should be consistent across both printed and electronic formats and across all versions."
5,Valuable on many fronts.,"The layout of this Bible, without columns, and the unique chronological approach, brought new insights and fresh interest to my daily Bible study. I became absorbed and actually finished in 6 months--which gives one a wonderful perspective of the whole of God's historical, written Word."
4,Bought this for my Pastor,I bought this for him for Christmas and he said it was good. I prefer the NKJ version so bought that one for my husband
5,Great choice!,"I've been a student of the Bible for many years and own numerous versions and study guides, including the Dakes. They're wonderful, but to be able to just sit down with this easy-reading Bible (NIV) that puts everything in chronological order has been a total pleasure.I've given some for gifts already and just got through ordering some more to give."
4,Pretty Decent,"The Bible is ""relatively"" chronological. It's difficult to put everything (especially the Gospels) in an exact order, I suppose, so the passages follow the ""traditional"" historical outline as most people understand it. However, I haven't read the whole thing yet."
5,We love it!,"In January of 2008, my wife and I started to use The One Year Chronological Bible for our daily devotions. It has been a deeply rewarding experience, by putting the Bible story in an easy to understand and more intuitive timeline."
5,Love it!,"I bought two of these bibles. One for my wife and one for myself to read together while I'm through the week. It's a great way to stay connected. We love actually reading the bible chronolicically and the NIV is an excellent version for ""story"" type reading. I would absolutely recommend it!"
1,"One Year Chronological Bible, NIV Kindle version","I recently downloaded the Kindle version of the One Year Chronological Bible only to discover that it wasn't the 1984 translation of the NIV, but the 2011 translation. Because the cover is the same and the new version is not identified on the cover I assumed it was the 1984 translation. Had I known, I would not have made this purchase."
3,Kindle Version NOT the same as written,"Have read through the hardcover version for several years with my church and was excited to download the kindle version on my ipad. Beware...it is NOT the same chronological as the written version. Its a WONDERFUL bible but dissappointed that I couldn't pick right up where the hardcover left off. Still giving it three stars because if you are just beginning from the kindle version, you won't miss a beat."
4,Misprints in Chronological Bible,"This is a great chronological Bible and I read it in hard back, but the Kindle version has a lot of typo errors and words missing. Hopefully in the next update these will be corrected."
3,politically correct,"I like the flow, but not the translation. They neuter the masculine and make all things gender neutral. The NIV was originally a good translation, but these later versions have taken a more liberal departure with the language. I trust the literal translation of the scripture when it comes to the actual words it takes from the manuscripts. The NIV is supposed to be a Bible, not an interpolation or commentary."
3,Lack of continuity with Hardcopy version.,The content or translation I can't argue with. My complaint is that my church uses this bible and the print version and electronic version are out of sync. It's a simple thing to make sure the hard copy matches the electronic version. I hope Tyndale reads this and puts out a revision for us.
5,Great gift,Gave this as a gift and the person loved it! It was not one that will hold up to a lot of wear and tear but is still great!
4,El Primo,"It's all in the live footage. Interspersed among somewhat predictable interviews ( bar the talks with Sam Butera ) it's dynamite. For the ones of us who never got to experience King Louis in the flesh, this gives a hint of what it must've been like."
3,Not Bad Bass-Happy No Wave,"A pretty good EP. It's more or less in the style of New York Bass-driven groups of its time like ESG and Liquid Liquid. It also reminds me of Bill Laswell's Material records during this period, and Bauhaus on one track.There's not guitar aggression so much as there is NYC dance groove here, but it sounds like Sonic Youth to me. It's weird and it's somewhat abstract and it's got dissonance and it wears its influences on its sleeve. They kept doing those things, just with more guitar and without a funky base."
5,SYR brought the Avante Garde into the light,"Sonic Youth's debut holds a special place in my heart, in my ear and in my collection. If only one band could be named for bringing avante garde music of the 20th century into the mainstream, it is them. One aspect of my enjoyment of their debut, is a certain austerity of this recording. The lyrics are sparse and come off more as poems, collaborating with a No Wave rhythm section and musique concrete guitars. I recently revisited my Iannis Zenakis collection and was pleased to discover a number of similarities between his 1960 composition ""Orient-Occident"" and several elements of early Sonic Youth. From ""She Is Not Alone"" to ""Freezer Burn,"" any fan of SYR would immediately recognize elements of what they brought out of the shadows and have allowed us to digest and enjoy. Thanks SYR."
3,bemoaning lost youth,"I don't actually have a copy of this CD yet...The cassette version of the EP was my first introduction to Sonic Youth. Side one was the five songs and side two was side one in reverse - even the text on the cassette was backwards. I miss that tape. I wish they had included the songs in reverse, also. I used to listen to side two as much as side one. Sigh."
5,Great deal!!,"The Calphalon Omelet pans and skillets are essential for the busy chef. To get both the 8"" and 10"" for under $50 is a fantastic deal!The 8"" is my ideal 2-egg omelet pan. The small size keeps the eggs fluffy, and no-spatula flips are easy (and quite impressive). You can keep the heat nice and high - I've never had one burn on me yet.The 10"" is great for fritattas and Denver omelets. The non-stick surface is a godsend when cooking eggs and breaded meats, and it really does clean up easily.Neither pan will last forever, particularly if you use them as frequently as I do (or if you occasionally poke them with a metal spatula). But for this value, you can't go wrong. There are surely more expensive non-stick pans out there, but for the price, these'll absolutely get the job done."
3,Thought I was getting a good deal.,I paid $29.99 for the set and thought I was getting a good deal with the listing price of more than $100 on Amazon until I received the package. It is listed as $29.99 on the package. So don't pay more than that.
1,Waste of money,"This the worst product line ever, thier non stick is worst than any cheap brand I ever used before. I have had calaphone products for less than 6 months and they are all worn out, the coating is just gone, anything i cook sticks to the bottom. COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY!!!"
5,Score Another Hit For Calphalon!,"I have to say that I am becoming a huge Calphalon Commercial Non-Stick Cookware Fan!These are, of course, the 2 most useful sizes of pans and are the workhorses in my kitchen. Great non-stick finish, the handles really are stay-cool, and substantial (but not too heavy). Total quality! And you absolutely can't beat the price.This set would make a great gift for bridal showers, housewarmings, students - just about anyone who has to or loves to cook!"
2,The interior surface pits and peels,"I have owned a Calphalon professional nonstick set for 4 years. Not very long in the life of cookware. The 10 inch omlete has become pitted and is now peeling between the pits. I e-mailed Calphalon to question what could be done. (There is supposed to be a lifetime warranty provided you hand wash and use non-netal utensils.) I have not put these pans in a dishwasher, ever! I own only non-metal and wooden utensils. So far, they have ignored my question and not responded for two weeks. I have to replace the pan. At $19.99 (advertised special), it is affordable. At $85.00(retail), there is better and more reliable cookware available."
3,From where does Amazon get these list prices?,"There are a lot of various pans available on Amazon, and I'm not savvy enough to know the difference, especially as among the various lines of Calphalon products. So when I see something like this set, which purports to have a ""list price"" of >$100 and also which is selling briskly, I figure this is a safe bet. But the pans are made in China and the manufacturer's packaging itself is printed with the price $39.99. I haven't used these yet, but doubt that they are the screaming bargain I hoped they were when I bought them."
2,Nonstick surface deteriorated,"I must admit these pans get daily use, but I was surprised that the nonstick surface has deteriorated. Once my favorite now ready to be thrown out...any suggestions?"
3,Problems with Non-Stick Coating,"I bought these pans because they were so highly rated, and seemed a great value. They do cook well, are heavy, and are very well built.The only problem I have had is with the non-stick coating. I have had issues with eggs sticking in the omelet pans, and also had a big problem with burned onions not coming out of the pan.I have seen better non-stick on cheaper pans.I always hand wash, but why can't they make these dishwasher safe. My Farberware Millenium pots have even better non-stick, but they are dishwasher safe."
4,overall Good Pan!,"This Pans are great..for Omelet, I dont recommend for Steakbut is great for Frenchfries.Calphalon Commercial non stick are well made pans, even this are from China no from Toledo.If you want to have the best, buy Calphalon One! you will seewhat I am talking about it. Note Calphalon One no those new Caphalon one nonstick glass lid!"
2,Small and somewhat heavy,My dog hasn't really taken to this yet. It's smaller than I expected and it's so heavy that she's afraid of it at the moment.I think I would have been better off getting a lighter-weight frisbee.
2,PLEASE either let customers pick COLOR or stop sending out GREEN!,"As much as I like the feel, materials, concept and quality behind this product, it is the SECOND time I've ordered from Amazon and gotten a GREEN toy. I don't know what other folks' lawn color is, but mine is GREEN. The last one we bought blended in perfectly and lasted about 2 weeks before my husband shredded it with his tractor mowing the lawn. As annoyed as I was at him (so were our kids and our dog, who really liked it), I agreed with his retort: why would you get the dog a green throw toy for outside, anyway?PLEASE LET US PICK THE COLOR when ordering... It might last longer and encourage me to buy more. I didn't think that lightening would strike twice on getting a green toy, but it certainly did. I won't be buying a replacement when this (inevitably) gets lost or shredded in the yard this Spring/Summer. What a shame, as it is a durable dog toy."
2,Ruff Dawg K9 Junior Flyer Dog Toy,"This disc Is not very ""ruff"".Our 15lb.terrier mix bit a hole in it within the 1st 30 minutes of supervised toss and fetch.Would not recommend for active dogs."
5,Wonderful little pouch,"This is really a great jewelry bag. Perfect for traveling and light storage. I would not recommend this is your jewelry is fragile as it does not offer much support but for costume jewelry, it's perfect."
5,It works!,"So, when I was trying to set a new door opener remote, my starting capacitor blew. I am no expert with these things, but it was not tough to tell what the problem was when I took the cover of the garage door opener. There was brown goo spraying out of the old starting capacitor. I used an index card to note the lead locations and removed it after it stopped spraying the stuff. I wrote down the model number of the capacitor and searched everywhere but only found it here on amazon. It does not look like the original (and it is a different brand), but it works. No issues, have been using for well over a month. Saved me $300 and 4-or-more hours to install a whole new opener. Worked well for me.Total time to install once it arrived - 10 minutes (5 of which was to move the cars and get the ladder setup). DIY level - beginner.NOTE: It is a given to most, but I might as well say it... unplug the garage door opener before removing or installing the capacitor."
5,Garage Door Repair,"My door was opening and I heard a load bang and oil leaked out of drive. I looked up the capacitor on Amazon and others had the same problem. I ordered the part, installed it and it works fine. Probably saved a $90. service call. Thanks."
2,The part was damaged before it was sealed in plastic bag,"The reason I know this, Is because there wasnt a broken piece in the sealed plastic bag!! So the piece was damaged before it was sealed!!"
5,Just what I needed,The cap was exactly what I needed. I worked and was very easy to replace. I saved the day for me.
4,Nice Aroma but not as titled!,"I was looking for coffee or espresso aroma from a candle. I ordered it since I saw its title ""espresso"". However, its aroma is chocolate, and nothing to do with coffee! although it is so nice."
2,Short Lifespan,"The BestAir box states, ""For best performance, change at least twice per season, maybe more depending on water conditions and frequency of use."" In my case, this pad failed badly, decomposing and gathering algae/mildew within 3 months of heavy mid-winter use in a heat pump system that runs frequently. I've placed two photos of failed pad in the user photos section here. I think that when it was working properly, the paper panel increased humidification over the all metal panel, but it has a very short lifespan compared to the 1 year recommended change interval for the metal panel (see Aprilaire website). I would not recommend this pad for heat pump systems, since they run much more frequently than a gas/oil system. This pad may be a good upgrade for a fossil fuel-based system, but make sure to check and change it frequently."
5,Well Done!,"Janet lives up to her style with this DVD. It makes a great companion to the book, and if you don't have it, I highly recommend it! I learned using the book, then got the DVD and seeing her play and her hand technique helped clean mine up and make things so much easier! This is a good starter for Scruggs style and to get a player ready for Earls book (also highly recommended!!!)"
1,The titel says it all.,What a fall from grace! What a mess! Shapeless songs with a sorry syntsound. When he and his wife try to be John & Yoko in an orgasm its almoust funny (but for the wrong reasons). No wonder Iggy fled when he and Manzarek tried to make a record together by this time.
2,Pretty Much Junk,"I started using lip smackers as a kid, and went back to them recently. My lips were desperately dry and I had purchased a bunch for some goody bags for my nieces, and now I am attempting to un-do the damage. The product smells like gross fake strawberry, not the fresh strawberry scent that many body sprays, perfumes, and hair products contain. Additionally this does not hydrate well at all! It wears off with an hour, and makes my lips peal. This also has a shine, so it is really a lip gloss more than a lip moisturizer or chap stick.Perhaps this is just a fun little gift or novelty pretend make up item for little girls. I know I liked them as a kid, but as an adult it just doesn't cut it."
3,Odd Couple cops,"Two unexceptional cops with opposite personalities are assigned to protect a mobster from Mafia hitmen. Tired plot and standard car chases overshadowed by varied characters, humorous script and suitably gritty 70's film style."
1,"""quality"" of Freebie & the Bean video",The original movie was good but quality of the video that I received was very poor. Very grainey and difficult to view.
4,"Thouroghly Fantastic. Witty, clever and an absolute riot.","This is without the best buddy cop movie ever made. Arkin and Caan make a fantastic team. The only real problem is that it thinks that it is an action comedy wheras it is actually a drama with action and humerous parts. One of the best crime movies of the 70s. Despite it's age it still manages not to be dated. Although it isn't totally PC it reflects how people were and still are. Gay people are still called fags, Caan's racist remarks to Arkin are just between two friends and don't have a real meaning. Some of it is incoherent but this, along with the other flaws are nothing compared to the superb acting talent and script. Arkin and Caan complement each other perfectly and there are nicely acted supporting roles especially from Bean's wife played by Valerie Harper.Overall a must see film which is worth viewing after viewing. Top stuff!"
5,Why No DVD Release?!!!,"Short and simple! A True Classic! A shame it has not been released on DVD yet. Great Characters, Lots of over-the-top Action, Stunt-man's Timeless Masterpiece. Starsky & Hutch, Running Scared, Lethal Weapon (all Buddy-buddy cop movies) have taken from. Although its humor will most likely offend virtually every one in some way, the blend of action & comedy never-the-less works. 4 Stars for a great Stunt Team. Oh, and NO CGI!!! ;-)"
5,A Real Gem.,"This film has always been one of my all time favourite films,so i suppose i am slightly biased.I fully appreciate that parts of this film would today be deemed politically incorrect,but come on it is only a film and it is 36 years old,and alot of things that were exceptable in 1974 are not accepted now.The on screen chemistry between James Caan and Alan Arkin really works .As a whole the films is just a real blast,you can see where some of the ideas for other buddy cop movies come from.Having read some of the other reviews my thoughts are that some previous reviewers need to lighten up and remember it is only a movie that is 36 years old.I for one am glad i paid the price for a film that i have searched for, for a long time."
1,BUYERS BEWARE! ILLEGAL LISTING!,This DVD is from the WBshop online where it is available for half the price. Resale of these archive DVDs is prohibited by Warner Brothers. Don't subsidize theft by paying twice the price.
2,Promising but disappointing !,"Well, I hate to be a party booper but I didn't like this Traviata. First and foremost, the sound is awful for a 1956 studio recording. The only word that comes to mind to describe this recording is laboured: the sound, the conducting, the singing, everything sound laboured and lifeless. Pierre Monteux is not in his element here, there is no flow to his conducting, and neither is Leonard Warren as Germont, the role just doesn't suit him very well. Rosanna Carteri was an admired Violetta in the 1950s but here she was either caught on a bad day or very poorly recorded, for the most part she sounds hard-toned, charmless and effortful. Cesare Valletti (Alfredo) is the most successful of the soloist though he is mostly done for by his environment. In sum, much talent assembled here but none seen to great advantage. The later RCA set from 1960 with Anna Moffo, Richard Tucker and Robert Merrill under Previtali is superior in every way."
2,Less than 250 pages on a cartridge,"Yes this printer is pretty cheap and prints well, and the ink cartridges are cheap. That said, I wouldn't recommend this one to anyone because the ink runs out really really fast. The cartridges it takes only hold 10ml of ink (most hold at least 17ml and some out there hold up to 50ml) and won't print more than 250 pages of text."
3,Consumer warning,"Yes, it says you need a USB cable, but who really pays attention? So this bargain printer required a trip to Radio Shack for a cable. Also, it needs your computer to have 64 megs. Our old Dell has 63. Sure, HP gives you a ""workaround,"" but there goes more time invested --- I mean: wasted. Maybe this printer isn't such a bargain after all."
4,About the ink cartridge costs,"There were several mentions of the ink cartridges not lasting long for the 3650, so I looked it up at HP. My old 882C workhorse's cartridge is 42ml (in black) and lasts a very long time using draft mode. Cost? $29.99 HP retail price. The cartridge for the 3650 is 10ml and costs $17.99. You can do the math.So, this may not be the best printer for you if you do a lot of printing and will be replacing ink often. I thought some folks might like to know the story if they are computer shopping.The photo ink cartridge (not included with the machine) is about $24.99 if I remember correctly."
1,Lopsided Product,"The Deskjet 3650 is good for general text printouts using a word processor on plain paper. It fails miserably on doing special tasks like printing sheet labels and the like. I've wasted tons of hours re-aligning my layouts just to print right -- and even then, this printer doesn't offset properly. If you're looking for a general text printer that's affordable and you don't do specialized printing often or can afford to waste time re-adjusting layouts, get this one. If you're busy and have about a 50% need for special formats like envelopes and labels, get something else. My old Deskjet 810c performs 100 times better than this junk."
2,mechanism error after 13 months,"The printer has been moderately used for black and white prints, and after 13 months it encounters a mechanism error, not printing at all. It is not worth fixing it, but buying a new one. Quality of prints was good, but life of the printer very short."
2,Not what I thought,"I didn't care for the story line of the movie. It seemed that they tried to hard. It definitely was not worth the $6.00 I paid for it. Maybe if it was $1, it would have been worth it. Everything in the movie revolves around sex... the whole movie! It's just stupid, not funny."
2,Not what I anticipated,I was really disappointed in this movie. I was expecting something much better. I will definitely be reselling this one.
2,"If finale would be different, I would give it three stars","The plot is described well enough in the overview and reviews of other viewers. The movie is a watchable, especially for woman, sitting by tv all by herself with some ice-cream. Story that can happen, still characters are rather week, especially Dexter and scenario lacks depth.However, I watched it and even would give it three stars, if not the last minute of the movie. If this would end up to be Ethan which is character played by Krasinski it would make it all more or less good and logical, at least for romantic comedy/drama. But when you see who you see - there is no any twist, it doesn't make sense, you can not help but feel sorry for Rachel.So, you can watch it - but it was total disappointment in the end."
3,They forgot to add this to the deleted scenes.,"It was ok I guess, the part where he told her he couldn't choose her ruined the momentum,And seeing her Devastated laying in bed on top of the building afterward, wow. If they delete that scene then I'll give it 4 Stars."
4,Something bitter,"I thought this movie was cute.Kate Hudson does a great job making you just wanna B*tch slap her,lol.But a little long in the tooth to be working with these younger actresses & actors."
2,"Good cast, but not that good of a movie","I watched this movie thinking it would be a funny romantic comedy, but it's not really like that. There are some funny parts, but not too many. The movie gets really boring and drawn out toooo much! I wouldn't recommend this movie unless it's the only thing that's on. If you want a good funny romantic comedy I highly recommend these.When in Rome [Blu-ray],The Ugly Truth [Blu-ray],Hit & Run,That Thing You Do!,Role Models (Unrated),How Do You Know [Blu-ray], andJust Like Heaven (Widescreen Edition). That's all I can think of off the top of my head right now. I hope my review(s) are helpful to everybody reading them."
4,Great Movie!!,"This is a really cute movie! It kinda drags on a little but keeps you entertained. Def worth watching & a great chick flick! ""Dex"" & ""Markus"" are HOT in this movie!! & who doesn't love Ginnifer Goodwin! She's adorable & plays a great bestie. Didn't give it 5 stars because I didn't like the ending....now you wanna watch it to see what I'm talking about :)))))"
2,Had so much potential,I read the book first. The movie didn't give the depth needed to understand why the characters behaved the way they did. That is often the case but in this instance it really hurt the storytelling.
3,Just plain romance,Okay so I read the reviews before I actually watched the movie so I knew what I was walking into. But its a movie people stop judging it like its a live show or something. Many movies have cliches or are predictable whether its action or romance. But if you try to enjoy the movie you will. Its cute and its a love story that anyone should want to see over and over again. It wasnt the best but it wasnt the worst either.
3,Fun to watch...,"This was a fun to watch, but unrealistic movie. The acting was good, but the story was sometimes painful to watch."
1,Possibly the most awkward film of the century,"I am OBSESSED with rom coms, and this one I literally had to stop watching after 30 minutes. It is horrendous."
4,Loved It!,"As good as the book? Of course not. Entertaining? Yes. Kate Hudson played Darcy PERFECTLY! and i'm so hoping that her and John take on Something Blue because though they hated each other, their chemistry was perfect. I loved every scene with them, who'd have thought they would be that great together. The movie is a fun romantic comedy and though the subject is taboo, you have sympathy for Dex and Rachel b/c you know their history and you know Darcy is not an innocent either. Their situations are all a big hot mess that gets worked out in the end."
3,something borrowed,Looked cute/funny so gave it a try. I loved John Krasinski. He was the best part of the movie. They could of gone so many ways with it...and they chose the worst in my view. I would of loved to see a different angle and someone you kind of hoped for..get the girl. I don't want to give the movie away...the ending is what is expected...which is too bad. Boy gets girl but wrong boy. Also Kate Hudson's character...they took the easy way out in making her look the reason for failure..that was just too easy a write in.I gave it an ok. I enjoyed seeing this but just wished for more creativity in the script and options.For those that love a love flick...you get the happy ending and its enjoyable. Just wished for something more~
4,I like it!,"Something borrowed is a really good movie! Since I bought it used I had no problems with it and I still don't. When I got it, the case had a little bit of flaws and the movie was scratched a little, but it didn't effect me from watching the movie all the way through without it skipping. I would recommend the company I bought this movie from!"
3,Good but not great,"I like the book that this movie it's made from, I read it just before the movie came out which normally it's not a good idea since books are usually better than the movies. This movie was not a disappointment, it was pretty close to the book with very minor changes which it makes it actually make more sense when you pack a book of hundreds of pages in a 2 hour movie.I give it 3 stars because to me it is still a movie that only appeals to a female audience, the story makes the guys appear unreal with the exception of Ethan who it's played by John Krasinski (and this is because John makes him more real and funny and just enjoyable to watch him in) by the end of the movie you just wonder why the main character (Rachel) made the choices she did.I liked the movie, I am just happy I rent it and did not spent my money in the theater."
3,"Cute, But No Cigar!!","Something BorrowedLike most of today's movies, just okay. A cute premise, that was a solid 3 stars. Perhaps a bit too long."
2,Weak plot,"The plot was lacking and the story wasn't all that touching. I should not have ignored its poor ratings on other websites. On the plus side, the acting was good even though the story wasn't."
5,great gift,great item why should I be required to say more than I feel is needed to say what I said?
4,C o l i n E g g l e s f i e l d,"The only good thing about this movie is Colin Egglesfield - he's the reason I'm watching it, he's the reason I'm buyin it. Good lord, put this man in more movies - he's easy on the eyes and a good actor! Hoping he plays Christian Grey next.."
1,total bummer,"WOW! What a let down after reading the book. I guess that is normal, but I was still so disappointed."
1,Don't waste your time!,"If you are looking for a good romantic comedy, this is NOT it! It takes turns that do not make sense based on the characters they present. I really like John Krasinski but, I don't even know why he was in this. He is just along for the ride here and there. SPOILER WARNING: His character's relationships makes no sense and his story never gets wrapped up at the end. There were so many better ways that this storyline could have taken. I had high hopes for this movie and was very disappointed. (I have never written a review before but, I had to on this one because it was that disappointing.)"
1,"If I could give this ZERO stars, I would","This is truly one of the worst movies I've seen in a very long time, and I do NOT understand all the positive reviews. The characters are cowardly and utterly deplorable. The entire plot line is disgusting and devoid of morals. Save yourself the time and the aggravation!"
4,it was good,"This movie was good, I realized I was frowning through much of it because it touches on the subject of betrayal."
3,ok,"I watched it because I read the book and loved it.... Kate Hudson is not ""Darcy""....Expect a 3 of 5 for entertainment"
2,Wait for Redbox!,I am disappointed in the movie's ending. The movie was good and the actors performed well but the script is lacking. Wait for Redbox to have it and watch it on a rainy day.
3,Not the book,"This movie is very funny and, for the most part, very well cast. The friends I watched it with enjoyed it enough to go out and read the book (or stay in and read the book -- they have kindles ;)That said, don't watch this movie expecting the book. Something Borrowed is one of my favorite books and this film, while enjoyable, is vastly different. I missed the Dex character from the book. He was flawed but not in such a way that it made me lose respect for him as it does in this version. John Krasinski steals every scene he is in and I ended up rooting for him over Dex."
1,So disappointing!,"I read the books and loved them...watching this movie was like ripping out pages to the books one by one. So, so, so bad! not even the same story line. don't waste yoru time and I like movies that suck sometimes - even romantic comedies, but this was bad!"
3,chick flick,Movie had some ups and downs but very predictable ending. Even my wife thought it was only 3 star movie and we both would have liked little more comedy.
1,Just awful!,"Usually I like romantic comedies! This is a movie where the world would be better off if all the main characters just died. A group of horrible people who cheat and lie to each other. Congrats to ""good girl"" Rachel for ending up with the guy of her dreams: her best friend's fiance. I mean, I guess I knew the plot to some extent when I rented it, but it was far more off-putting than I imagined it would be. The only likable, decent character is the one who loses out. And the selfish, cheating liars end up together (which I suppose is fitting). I'd say don't waste your time with this one!"
4,"Kate Hudson...no, no, no","I read the book a couple of years ago and loved it. That being said I didn't have high hopes for the movie, because usually the movie is not as good as the book. I don't necessarily think the movie disappointed. I knew the story so I knew what to expect. Ginnifer Goodwin was excellent, as were John Krasinski and Colin Egglesfield. But Kate Hudson...at one point one of my friends looked at me and said ""she's doing a great job cause I can't stand her!"" knowing that we should hate Darcy based on the book. But she took it to another level. I don't normally like her, but this was even difficult to watch at times. It all just seemed so forced that it really took me out of the movie. Overall, I still really liked the movie and being the rom-com fan that I am, I'm sure I'll see it again someday when it come out on DVD. So, at the end of the day, to me it is a good chick-flick, especially if you have a long-time best friend to see it with."
2,if you approve,"if you approve of cheating, adultery, dishonesty and things of that nature this movie will be right up your alley. I was terribly bored with this movie. I couldn't relate to any of the characters because they were such awful people. I only gave it two stars because i did laugh a couple times."
1,Horrible movie with terrible dialogue and storyline,"We watched this on the plane and while I'm a big fan of Krasinki from The Office, this movie was terrible. It had horrible dialogue and the storyline is uninspired. Would you ever cheat on your best friend? It left a bad taste in my mouth."
1,Not worth watching,"Awful plot, terrible script, totally unsympathetic/unbelievable characters. I hated this movie! The whole thing is about cheating and dishonesty. I am a sucker for a romance comedy or chick flick, but this movie is trash. In my opinion it is terrible, a complete waste of time. Definitely one of the worst movies I've seen in a while."
1,Something to avoid...,"The whole premise of this movie is based on Rachael and Darcy being best friends. I have one question: Why would Rachael be friends with someone as unpleasant and selfish as Darcy is when Darcy has absolutely no redeeming qualities, not even one? The only realistic character was played by John Krasinski which was the only reason I watched this movie to the end."
1,Not very happy,"I ordered the DVD and it arrives right on time, but then when I watched I found that it was scathed. So I contacted the seller and they were great about sending a DVD out right away. But then when I went to watch the new one I found this one to be scratched as well, I didn't bother contacting the seller again and just left it alone. So the seller is great but the product not so much."
2,Not worth the $9.50 admission price...,"OK, so it was ""Girls Night Out"" and we decided to catch this flick. I am not a Kate Hudson fan but do like some of the other actors. I was very disappointed in the film. Some scenes were quite funny but they were starring the actors I do like (John Krasinski and Steve Howey)...the rest of the movie was just lame...I was so frustrated with the ending I wanted to SCREAM. My girls didn't care for it either..one even got up and left after about an hour of enduring lame acting. I think somewhere I read it was rated a ""D""...I concur. Maybe I just need to stick with reading books for entertainment. Thanks Hollywood."
1,"Bad Bad Bad, Kate Hudson Worse Than That","Caught a sneak peak, I should have snuck out. Oh, how awful. Kate Hudson is worse than awful. Why does this woman keep getting hired. I mean, if she volunteered to star in movies they should turn her down. Poor thing has convinced herself that she's something special yet her wretched personality comes shining through in her acting and ultimately sinks the flick. If she were a middle class broad, she'd be deemed a needy horrific mess of a person that most people would politely try to avoid. Hollywood, however, keeps feeding the machine and she feels like she has something to offer the world. NOT NOT NOT. Please retire and make room for better actors. Go schlep the make up you make mega a bucks to support that doesn't even make you look all that. Awful flick."
4,Cute!,"This is a good chick flick. Yes, it is predictable but I still liked it. I bought it as a gift for my 16 year old daughters friend."
5,Love the movie,I love this movie and could watch it over and over. It's funny and romantic. The disc was a good buy too.
5,Loved the book! Loved the Movie,"I am a huge Emily Giffin fan and truthfully I wasn't sure if I would enjoy the movie. Many times the movies aren't as good as the books. There were changes made to fit the time constant, but the changes that were mad I thought enhanced the story. Instead of falling in love with Ethan in book two we get to love him in the movie or I did! I hope they make something blue into a movie too!"
1,Disgustingly Horrid,"Way to ruin a good book. Hollywood couldn't live with the basic principle of having characters that weren't ""good"" so they changed the basic premise.When is Kate Hudson ever in a good movie anyway, so I should have known.Maybe if you haven't read the book and catch the movie on a day when nothing else is on it's acceptable. Otherwise you will be majorly disappointed. I guess Giffin was so flattered or starstruck she wasn't able to keep them to the integrity of her book. Felt slimy after watching it so I turned it off midway."
1,"RIP, Romantic Comedies","Movies like Something Borrowed are the reason romantic comedies have earned such a bad reputation. Bad writing, lame characters, clichéd plot, Kate Hudson: all the ingredients are there, and the result is predictable and dull. How I miss real romantic comedies, like ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""Kissing Jessica Stein."" I wonder what happened to them and why they've been replaced with this tripe that's neither romantic nor funny."
1,Disturbed me..,"The movie started off ok and though Kate Hudson's character was a little one dimensional it wasn't bad. Then it changed. What I really did not like was the relationship that formed between her best friend and her fiancee. After I watched the movie, I was so upset because it brought up all the feelings of my ex-husband cheating on me and ending our marriage. I was not prepared for the cheating and coverup in this movie of the fiancee and the friend's sexual encounters and I did throw this movie away. I would caution others and I did my friends of what to expect."
1,Broken Movie,"Movie would not play when I watched it on a normal dvd player, and skipped on a high tech dvd player! I was very disappointed!"
1,Book is wayy better..,"Do not watch this movie!! It definitely ruins the story of the book, the movie was too fast-paced, and it was not romantic at all. They changed up quite a few things in the movie from the book which was disappointing."
2,did not like,did not like how the story turned out and definitely would not watch it again. there wasn't even enough good stuff in it to make up for the awful way the story turned out
1,one of my least favorite romances,"first time doing a review... feel like i really need to share so people don't waste their time/money. honestly, i'm a huge fan of romantic comedies/dramas. however, the acting in this movie was so poor and the story-line was lame. i really couldn't relate to the characters and didn't find them at all believable. i wouldn't even watch this movie if it was shown on a transatlantic flight and i had nothing better to do. and that says a lot."
4,Liked it,This is a cute movie. I like Ginnifer Goodwin so I figured I would like this movie. I had read the books so definitely wanted to see how this movie would follow the book. It's cute even if the subject is tricky
3,Cute movie,"There was great chemistry between all the characters. It was wasn't I want to tell all my friends about this movie. However, it was good entertainment."
4,Nice movie,Enjoyed the movie. Story is nice. Nice chick flick movie to watch with friends. it is a good movie. .
2,Disappointing,"Having become a great fan of Airtime Publishing's books over the past 10 years, this book has been somewhat of a disappointing expirience. The book only contains articles previously published in Wings of Fame/Int. Airpower Review/World Air Power Journal with in some cases some additional information. There has been no effort what so ever to change the appearance of the articles, so even the chapters names from the journals are the same as in the journals.On the other hand, the text and pictures are of great quality, but there was nothing new for me.In all, a nice purchase for someone who does not have a subscription to any of the journals."
1,There are better books out there to help you!,"Hi, I have never written any reviews and don't plan on making a habit of it, but I know what it is to be truly heartbroken. I want to help you in any way I can because I know what you are going through. I have read every book on the subject that is out there, believe me. If you are really hurting, this book is not for you. It does not give you practical advice to help you get through the hurt. It's goal is to make you laugh and even at that, when you are hurting so badly, that is hard to do. I recommend two books for you: ""You Didn't Complete Me"" and ""It's Called a Break-up because it's Broken."" These were much more helpful to me."
4,Light-hearted look at love,"I started the morning off crying because I saw something that reminded me of my ex. After reading this book, my mood was much lighter and hopeful. However, I do think you should consider accompanying this book with a serious break up book if you are truly seeking a way to get over a relationship."
3,Will make you laugh!,"This isn't a book to help you get over your ex. It made me laugh though when I wasn't in the best of moods after my break up. So, if you just broke up and need a not so serious self-help read, go ahead and get this. If anything, it WILL make you laugh!"
1,"If you're hurting, don't go near this shallow book","Kuster has a flair for facile, formulaic humor. But one could hardly imagine a more soulless and useless book for anyone who has been dumped. Another way of putting it: If you are in pain, if your heartache is intense, if you were dumped by someone you deeply, truly loved, this book will have ABSOLUTELY no utility for you. If, on the other hand, you are trying to get over a shallow relationship, you might get a few chuckles out of this quickie, superficial read. It's a cynical, emotionally glib, even hateful book."
3,Wait a year before reading....,"My first thought upon reading ALL these breakup scenarios--and then looking at the photo of the very young author--was ""how the h... did she find time for so many ex-boyfriends?"" Already, I was jealous! I had wasted more than a quarter of a century with the same ""ex."" As a result, I couldn't imagine any relevance to me right off. I had to wait a year before any of it seemed really funny. Nevertheless, the writing still is irreverant enough to elicit a smile, whatever stage you are at. I think exorcising the ex is a whole lot harder when you still share a kid and when the ex (as in my case) is a public figure and you can see his name (and his girlfriend's) in magazines at the grocery checkout counter. Maybe I ought to check out Ivana Trump's book."
5,GREAT BOOK MADE ME LAUGH!,Great book makes you feel good and laugh but at the same time it helps you realize your not alone in what your going through and this book not only makes you laugh but it helps you to get through this hard time.
2,"It was OK, but...","...more 'silly' than 'funny', in my opinion. Also, it felt very dated to me; I could tell it had been a while since it had been written."
3,Funny but not the be all instructional,"I found this book in the midst of a terrible break up. I enjoyed it for what it was, entertainment. It made me laugh and not cry, so it served it's purpose. For something deeper and more practical emotional advice, I would look into something else. But it did make me laugh out loud more than a few times. I would recommend it to someone coming out of the depression, as a comic relief."
4,better than the import version,"with some different tracks and sequencing the Thrill Jockey version is far superior to the previous import. it's not the masterpiece that Glam is, or Iaora Tahiti but mouse on mars are still the best electro-gurgle outfit going."
1,Stop fiddling about!,"Lots of DSP fiddling, beat fussing, shards of melody that never cohere--what happened to the top shelf boom of ""Bib"" or ""Frosch""? This is just more 99 style laptop wankery."
5,Excellent musical fun,"If your child is into music doing there own thing and looking cute all at the same time this is the toy for them. My daughter loves it, you can mix play the piano choose a variety of pre-recorded sounds to mix in with your own little creation."
1,"Not a word on C++, It shouldn't be named this way","I wasn't looking for a book on algorithms in C (I already have several of them), I was looking for C++ phylosophy and advantages applied to algorithms. It was very disapointing."
1,the worst code examples ever seen,"The code examples in this book require cryptography to interpret - the idea of meaningful variable names is not something that the author subscribes to. I would not recommend this book to anyone starting out programming because it reinforces bad code layout, and doesn't show what can be done by using sensible variable names to help write self-documenting code. More experienced programmers would probably rather read pseudocode anyway... Algorithms in C is significantly less useful than the earlier Algorithms book by the same author."
3,Best of the bunch,I had to teach this course and must see it is the pick of the books I have seen on this subject though it is far from ideal. Why can't these people use meaningful variable names and comment the code. Is it the authors intent to teach bad programming practice.
3,Plain average!,"This is an okay book. The algorithms are described in great detail (actually sometimes too much detail), moreover it is not very mathematical. For this reason it could be the choice for the readers fed up of the math in other algorithms books e.g., Cormen et al's.However the biggest complain I have with this book is that it is overloaded with too much contents. When things could have been described in a few lines, dozens of paragraphes have been used for it. The reader just losts in the text. And interestingly the job is still not done, i.e., the reader is still not able to follow the algorithms easily.Also for this reason it is not a good choice for someone wants to get a quick overview or revision."
1,Decent but I know a much better book.,"I have read this book and found that most of the code examples are useless. Don't think I am one of those people who want code and not theory, I just think it helps to have a decent example to the theory to work from. This book is not too clear and definitely not worth the money. I do happen to know a much better book written by Jeff Ullman called Foundations of Computer Science. The book is much clearer, simpler, and better organized. I suggest if you are looking for a similar book you get that one instead(NOTE: the book was written by my dad. . . but it would be better anyway.)"
2,to difficult to understand,i feel writer is confused and writes very jumbled together spaghetti code.to tough to uderstandhorrible reference book
5,Attention : These are NOT reviews for part 5,"Just wanted to let everyone know that the reviews here (till 6th March2002 at any rate) are not of the book 'Algorithms in C++ part 5graph algorithms' by Robert Sedgewick, but of the earlier edition ofhis book on algorithms.To get an idea of the book it's supposed to be about, please refer tothe review(s) on 'Algorithms in C part 5 graph algorithms', which iexpect to identical but for the code.It'd be surprising indeed if the book isn't substantially better thanthe reviews for the earlier book indicate ..........The first volume, ie parts 1-4 are excellent - please refer to thereviews on that, they're for the current edition :-)"
3,Code is translated from Pascal,Bob once admitted that almost all the code is translated from Pascal. He does not have time to write the same code for various editions of his books and uses translator software...
4,Bought this to complete the series...,"I don't intend to read this book from front to back (well maybe one day if I get really bored) but I think this book does a very good job explaining the algorithm without getting obsessed with overly formal mathematical games. In my opinion the graphs are the most important part of the series, since these are the algorithms and data structures that usually AREN'T included in a programming language's libraries; STL for example. You will find many of these topics in a mathematics and statistics program (how I first encountered them) so the book does get mathematical, but out of necessity.4 out of 5 stars for sometimes being unclear."
4,This is a GREAT algorithms book for intermediate level...,"Finally a book that just cuts to the chase and gives you the building blocks for basic and advanced data structures and methods. The chapters are well written so that you won't feel too tired after reading one, and the code is pretty concise and readable. The book begins with elementary algorithms and data structures that should be under every programmer's belt before moving on to the good stuff: hash tables, graphs, n log(n) sorting algorithms, Red-Black trees, and really cool heap array implementations. If that wasn't enough for you, the book moves on to upper level undergrad type algorithms that will be useful in the future. I thought the chapter on Hash Tables was well written and easy to implement. Also, the chapter on Graphs was easy to understand with their pictures of various ""trees"" or ""forests"" that could form with nodes. I'd highly recommend reading the hash table chapter with the hash function ""hashpjw"" from the ""Dragon Book."""
3,Covers a lot but poor example and bad coding practice.,"This book covers a wide variety of algorithms, ranging form basic sorting and searching to file compression and encryption. It's a wonderful text to learn about algorithms, not necessary data structure. In fact, it would be a good reference book for computer algorithm in general. This book, however, lacks any coding standard in its examples. In fact so of the code is not very self explanatory. For example, there's a plentiful usage of simplified variable names and unspecified and undeclared variables."
2,Ugly and Obtusely written examples and text.,"For being one of the top computer gurus, this person sure writes some ugly code. Many if not most of the code samples are broken. Also he uses cryptic variable names (a, b, c, x...) and bad coding form in general (most variables are global). This would be fine if this was not a text for Learning algorithms. (looks like the example code was run through a Fortran to Pascal to C converter) On the other hand, I found many of the illustrations very helpful in figuring out what he was trying to say with text. If this book was not required for my class I would not have bought it. I found Numerical Recipes in C to be more useful."
4,Good reference for data structures in any old language,"This doesn't do a very good job of presenting data structures that mesh into a well designed C++ program, but it's got great explanations of the algorithms themselves, and if you're a half-decent programmer, you can code up a design yourself quickly from the explanations given."
3,Fair to midland,"This book was probably pretty good in 1992 but, is terribly outdated now. There is a complete lack of modern data structures and anything close to encapsulation techniques just isn't here. I would recommend a more up to date book. For what it's worth, I have yet to see ANY book written in C that gives in-depth coverage of the most frequently used data structures."
4,great - for a very specialized audience,"Most people don't prefer to listen to modulated electronic noise as music. If you do, this is masterly stuff. A few of the tracks are quite amusing. IF you are open to electronic noise as music."
4,Works for me,"I was looking for a recovery drink that didn't have so many synthetic ingredients. This one is 75% organic. Tastes great but goes fast. For my weight (215lbs) its three Huge scoops with 24oz of water. Working out five days a week one (2.13lb jar) lasts me just under two weeks. Tastes great, and makes me feel better after workouts. GREAT!"
5,Top class,"Bought it for a friend (with her money). She's had it exactly 2 years now and nothing major to report. Software got cluttered, but I sorted that by removing some unnecessary startups and reloaded the problem apps. Then it was soaring again.Lately though she said it freezes occasionally. Don't know what's wrong yet."
4,Works Great,"I bought this unit refurbished for $65 to scan all my important documents from my file cabinet. I downloaded the driver software from the HP website. After some initial glitches, I read the manual and figured out how to set the various options I needed. I am extremely satisfied with the performance of this product. The automatic document feeder works flawlessly, even on two sided documents. This was an excellent investment.Update: I just scanned 250 photos using the automatic document feeder and experienced NO jams. This scanner has already paid for itself in time savings.Orlando, FL"
2,Okay when it works.,"I expected much better for the price. Software is a little quirky. Scanner after moderate use has stopped working. Scanner gives a ""DMA TimeOut"" message, then it won't do anything and even the on/off button won't work. HP customer support? Forget about it. There must be other scanners out there that are reliable."
1,Problem with TLMonitors VENDOR,"This is a review of the VENDOR, not the scanner. I ordered HP ScanJet 8250 Document Scanner through Amazon; vendor is TLMonitors. Item was advertised as ""Very little use, still in original box."" Vendor asserted on their invoice that ""drivers on a disc"" were included; in fact, they were not included. Vendor was resistant to my returning it. Vendor said the driver could be downloaded from the internet. For someone more tech-savvy than I, this might be a good option; it is not a good option for me."
4,Great price and product,"The scanner I purchased was delivered on time and worked very well with little to no problems, I would definitely recommend this scanner and the company that I purchased it from."
4,HP Doc Feeder,I am very satisfied with this product. It came in very good condition. It allows me to scan in a large volume of records at a fast pace.
2,"Unreliable, jams, software glitches","The rollers are not great, so it will jam periodically. The worst thing is the software. It freezes and has to be re-installed all the time."
1,HP ScanJet 8250 - Document feeder jams too much,"Don't buy this product if you really need the document scanner to scan photos. It consistantly jams and misaligns photos. The software included and other scanning functions work great, but the document loader is not good for photos."
2,HP Scanjet 8250,I purchased this scanner as used. Received it with no instructions or manual and have yet been able to use it as anticipated. It may be a good item but based on what I experienced I would not recomment it at all.
1,Scanning slides,"Don't buy this product for scanning slides or film strips - the software crashes regularly, it takes forever to initialize, I often get an error message saying that the HP Scan software is ""unstable"" and should be restarted. Sometimes you don't get the option to select slides in the file menu so it just scans the entire scanner glass. It's OK with documents. I'm a Mac user & accustomed to well-designed products. This scanner is slow & almost useless unless you just want to scan text documents, & I paid top $$ for it 3 years ago. Just started using it for slides. Wish I'd known this before I bought it."
3,An Introduction to beginners,"This book is good for beginners, however it needs to have more exercises for the reader. It lacks a section that lists how to publish a web site, even though is a very simple process, is not listed on this book. Nevertheless it contains a glossary that people who are having their first drink of the internet will find handy."
5,Really Learn to Create a Website for Dummies,"Skip the ""for dummies"" series and use this workbook. Step by step, you learn and build on the rudimentary skills you already possess or you wouldn't be reading this review."
5,A FASCINATING TRUE CRIME BOOK,"This book about one of the country's worst serial killers is very well written and exceptionally well documented. The middle part of the book reminded me of Norman Mailer's The Executioner's Song, which is no small compliment! Author Gary Lavergne's other book, The Sniper in the Tower, is an all-time great book in the true crime genre. I eagerly look forward to his next book. (This book has lots of photos throughout the pages of the book as ALL works of non-fiction should have, but so many don't.)"
3,"for Peter Beard from Magosha, New York","I am affraid Peter got it all mixed up, not the authors of the book. Clark Gable won an Academy Award in 1935 for Frank Capra's comedy ""It Happened One Night"". Also did ""King Kong"", winning in 1977 the special Oscar for best visual effects."
5,a great big dessert,"finally, an oscar book that's actually fun to read. usually these things are written for stat junkies and cinephiles who can make this stuff sound like work rather than entertaining. this one is even great to look at. the photos, the writing -- a real pleasure, like a great big dessert! i'm hooked."
4,HELP,"I am being held prisoner in my home! Although this book is wonderful, please rescue me! I leave near the gas station, by where the 7-11 used to be."
1,Link to this book and truth...Warts!,"Listen, books like this need to feature more pictures of me! I don't understand this tide in the human after. peeples who are ready for stunts and mack don't interest me. Trample the awards to finish. Aipe trop and the shirts hyple. ALL THE TIME!A state of what? Don't wrestle!That's the lesson of this book.Cank.Done."
2,Inexcusable mistakes,"While I am always excited when a new Oscar book is published this is a book that you probably shouldn't get too excited over. While there are some interesting parts about this book the very simple fact that they get the most basic facts wrong is inexcusable. Estelle Parsons has only won 1 Oscar, not 2. There are other such mistakes like that. It just made me wonder how many other mistakes there are in the book that I didn't catch. There are some admirable aspects to this book, but wait until this book is in the $10 book bin to buy it."
2,Enjoyable Book however with several errors,"Don't get me wrong this was an enjoyable book, the layout extremely impressive, and , considering I have a lot of books on The Oscars, this one managed to keep my interest. However I am concerned about some glaring mistakes throughout the book, which to me devalues the book when it comes to settling arguments. Errors which include the book stating that Katherine Hepburn has won 8 oscars!, it incorrectly identifies Walter Brennan as Wallace Berry, says the Helen Hayes won in her screen debut then a few years later notes that Gale Sondergaard becomes the first person to win an Oscar in her debut film. As well as that it notes the Laurence Olivier is the only person to direct himself to an Oscar, totally ignoring the fact that Roberto Benigni did it in 1998. As I said an enjoyable book but be wary with the facts. Not worth the 60-70$ price range, but still a nice buy."
1,The Shoddiest Book Ever Written,"Avoid this error-ridden expensive book at all costs! Want examples? Katharine Hepburn ""went on to win eight Academy Awards"" (pg 30). Er, how about three, guys? ""Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne were the first couple to be nominated in the same year"" (pg 27). How about Norma Shearer and Irving Thalberg, who were nominated together the year before? Supporting actress winner Mercedes McCambridge died in the year 2000 (pg. 94), which must be news to the still-living McCambridge. Embarrassing book with errors on practically every Oscar year. Authors Gail Kinn and Jim Piazza deserve a very special hall of shame award for producing the least-accurate and most amateurish book on any subject I've ever read."
5,Sooo cute!,"I ordered three different binky holders and while this wasn't the best quality of the three, it certainly was the one that got worn the most. It looked cute with every outfit my daughter wore and stayed put quite well. I would recommend this binky holder unless you have a child that would insist on putting the bear in his/her mouth and potentially get the clip off."
1,Don't buy this product,I bought this product and it would not register on the website. Despite repeated attempts. I contacted tech support with the problem. They sent a cursory e-mail and no follow up response. When you buy a product you expect it to work. Stay away from tenebril products. I am extremely unhappy.
4,"Helpful, Informational &Detailed, but not for all computers.","This study guide will give the novice user some hands on experiences as long as their computer is very similar to the one in the book. The user of this book should have access to DOS, Windows 3.1, Windows 95, operating systems to receive the fullest benefit to those chapters. Also another computer for networking for the peer to peer exercises. Great teaching aid."
2,The product doesn't seem to have any greater ...,The product doesn't seem to have any greater benefits than the average over-the-counter ibuprofen product. I think I'll stick with the generic. It really didn't make much of a difference.
5,I'm not one to get severe menstrual cramps. ...,"I'm not one to get severe menstrual cramps. However I sometimes get those tummy-cringing pains and look for relief. Normally, I turn to a nonprescription, over-the-counter pain reliever that helps the pain subside for a short time and requires you to take two tablets. With the Midol Maximum Strength Cramp Formula Tablets you can take them once and they provide maximum strength relief for painful menstrual cramps and other premenstrual bodily aches. This DEFINITELY is a product I'll continue to purchase just for when those surprising cramps do happen!"
4,great book; some concerns,"I ordered this book for my young granddaughter who, at nearly 3 years of age, is ready to consider simple discussion of table manners. I am generally delighted with the book and believe it is one that can grow with a child, having applications even into adulthood.I was startled, however, to find lie-lay errors on pp. 7 and 55. I also note numerous other small changes that would greatly improve a future edition. For example, some pages are written in the imperative, some are written in the declarative....some are in the third person, some are in the second person, and at least one (p. 44) slips into the first person plural. In addition, frequent use of unnecessary quotation marks is distracting.The book fills an important niche in a child's library, but it is limited by the above weaknesses. I do not mean to be critical....I have corrected pp. 7 and 55 in my edition and will enjoy this charmingly illustrated book with my granddaughter. You could do the same."
5,Assisting those you care who suffer from Schizophrenia,"After 8 years and many consultations in several countries and myriad of books and literature, this book is by far THE BEST book for a family or someone who has a loved one suffering from schizophrenia. Xavier Amador has done a brilliant job in putting things in simple English as a family guide on how to support and what to expect."
3,Truth,"If you've had a mental illness, worked with someone who has an illness, or lived with someone with a mental illness; this book has a way of explaining the logic you might run into. A great reminder that we are more than just our illnesses."
3,"I'm not sick, I don't need help","I havenot read this book yet, although it was recommended to my by the head of an advocacy agency for people with chronic mental illness, which is a strong plus. It's not a very long book, but from the list of contents, it looks to deal with issues other publications have not dealt with such as the truth behind denial of illness and resistance to taking drugs which might otherwise stabilize psychotic symptoms.The delivery of this book went smoothly and it arrived in good shape."
5,"Xavier Amador has really gotten a homerun w/I'm Not Sick...,","Amador has hit a homerun with this book. As a parent of someone suffering from Bi-Polar or perhaps Schizophrenia(not always clearcut). Amador makes it clear that even trained psychologists need a newer approach to reach patients who are either in denial,or are very intelligent. My son has a BS in psychology from a big 10 university. He seemed to start the downhill cycle after the death of his father at age 23. My son went through all the stages while we were desperately searching for ""a cure"",or ""hope"".He has been in an 8 year struggle. We finally found a great healing community,CooperRiis. They use a lot of the same principles that Amador presents in his book. Basically he wants to empower patients in the treatment plan,give them options that they can buy into as opposed to more and more medication and orders to comply with or simply listen to the patients."
5,Where has this book been hiding?,"Be sure to read all the reviews posted here. Take all the 5 star reviews, add them together, and you will begin to have a feel for what I thought of this book. I learned a lot of things I needed to know but hadn't (leaving me to wonder why aren't all mental health professionals knowledgable about the new research and trained in the type of therapies written about in this book?), and the advice Dr. Amador gives worked. Thank you!"
3,Not 5.1 surround sound,"Don't think this is a surround sound DVD Audio, cause it aint! Much like the DVD-Audio versions of Neil's ""On the Beach"" and probably, ""Stars N' Bars"" this is stereo, not 5.1 channels. It still sounds great."
4,review for supplements,"I have had some success with this product, and will continue using it until it's no longer necessary."
3,Useful tool,Very useful tool but it was not so clear to me the very specific application is in an office enviroment. After I read it I understood the specificity of the book
2,Akai LCT2785TA,I bought this unit and I sent it back after I received it. The main reason is that it does not work with Directv receiver remotes. I searched the internet and found that many others had the same problem. None of the codes work. The picture quality seemed good but I didn't want to bother with using 2 remotes on this TV- too many remotes in the house already. Another thing I didn't like about this TV was the stand.
4,Works!,Does it's job. Helps with running cadence which is very helpful when trying to run with efficiency. Definitely recommend for beginner runners as well as advanced!
2,Obnoxious!,"I purchased this metronome to accompany my guitar practice and it has such an appalling sound that I returned it immediately. It has four volume options and even the quietest setting is still very loud when compared to an acoustic guitar. Also, the beeping sound it emits is the equivalent of a smoke detector alarm. Very off-putting when you're trying to create a beautiful sound with an instrument."
2,Batteries arrived dead,"I cant provide an accurate rating since I haven't been able to use the device because the included batteries arrived, dead, besides that, the plastic feels cheap. nevertheless, I expect it to work as advertised"
3,Some songs inappropriate,"Most of the songs on this CD are ok for middle and high school kids. I love the arrangement of Somewhere over the Rainbow by Ab Orchestra. The other songs are very ""dance party"" like. However, some lyrics are inappropriate for children of any age. They were not made child friendly. For example: In Mambo no. 5 the lyrics ""going to the liquor store"" were left on this version. Also, The Kids Choir singing ""Boom, Boom, Boom"" - TOTALLY inappropriate song, ""I want you to sleep in my room...forever"". Whoever the editor was for this CD should be fired. If I had known what I know now, I would have just bought the other fun songs as singles and not purchased the entire CD."
4,Lots of scent in a small can,"The small cans have three scent pads in each. Coronado cherry emits a most pleasing fragrance; the Monterey Vanilla is also quite pleasant.The product freshens the air quite a bit--even stale basement air. There are a lot of air freshening products ""out there""; I would rate this as one of the better ones available."
4,Good for the Native!!,This book may lack high quality info. for the experienced outdoorsman but for the common Missoula area Native this book supplies the perfect amount of pertinent information. Where it lacks in detail it excells in simple english.
1,LACKS EVERYTHING NEEDED FROM A GOOD GUIDE BOOK.,"This book lacks everything you would expect from a useful guidebook. The trail maps are completely useless in the field. Compounding the complete uselessness of this book are the vague and poorly written hike descriptions. Every hike sounds as boring as the next (even though they traverse some stunning scenery), almost as if this book was researched/written completely at a desk - instead of out in the field. I wonder if the author even set foot on any of these trails?"
5,A Religious Experience,"Simply washing with Dr. Bronner's is a religious experience, guaranteed to cure what ails you. If simply washing proves inadequate, the text on the label is always good for spiritual edification. But remember what the good Dr. Bronner taught us: DILUTE! DILUTE! DILUTE!"
2,Mars Mission Tank Ambush,"This is an excellent product for children learning to build and create items. Once constructed, the tank is very fragile and easy to break. If the item is to be purchased for a child who will play with the item after constructed, STAY AWAY!"
3,Struggling with some of the themes of Mars Mission.,"My son turned six last week and he has been excited about the new Mars Mission Lego sets since he first spotted them in the magazine. I, however, have been struggling with the themes of the set. First of all, if humans are exploring Mars, that makes US the ""aliens,"" not them. Second, why is there the assumption that ""aliens"" are automatically on the attack? I don't like the human-centric assumptions and the explore-attack-conquer approach to learning about the rest of our universe. Maybe I'm being too sensitive but it seems like a slightly more balanced view of space exploration could have been presented with this set. Sure, they're just toys; but they help children build a foundational understanding of our culture, our world, our universe."
3,Light but still deep,The group's particular brand of trio fury suffers from too much downtime here in between intense statements of purpose.
4,never fail to astonish,"this record is at least as good as their last two releases, albeit not anything too new for them (sorry, no singing). great listening that makes you completely forget anything else on your mind."
3,I hate to spoil the party...,"but this album sounds more than a little like ""Ocean Songs"", and could hardly be considered an evolution of Dirty Three's sound. Unlike the band's previous work which pioneered a new direction in instrumental rock, this album is mired in a swamp of extraneous violin overdubs, and contains much less in the way of actual musical substance. The Dirty Three formula is unique enough to make this album a reasonably entertaining listen, but it's a half-hearted effort at best."
1,Needs to be more .... than this for me to listen,"This music presents boring and familiar concepts to my ears. It's more about a casting a spell of currently hip-depresso atmosphere and setting a dirgelike pace that, combined, is supposed to create interest or emotion,but musically it is unsophisticated and that is not because it has a country taste, either - some country is quite clever and authentic. Maybe I've heard too much music but this is like listening to someone's bad music recital."
1,I love vanilla,But this vanilla bean flavor had a bitter taste and was very unpleasant to use for anything. Basically just tossed it in recycling bin.
3,If you like the vainilla bean its for you!,"Its incredible the real flavor that has this product, that besides it is sugar free.I didnt like because this kind of flavor (vainilla bean) is not for me.I like more ""normal"" vainilla.But congratulations!You have a lot of sugar free flavors and we choose what we like.If you like the vainilla bean this its for you!"
4,Da Groom Does Denim,"This was a surprise for my groom for our wedding trip. We got married in Maui (So we got Maui'd!) and I thought it would be cute for pictures on the beach. It was. These hats were a bit big on us though. They say that they have to be handwashed, not wrung out and to shape it and sit out to dry. Don't listen to that. We needed them to shrink and they are denim and can handle the washing machine & the dryer. They now fit and it is after the fact. We did like them and wished we washed and dried them before our wedding trip. They would have looked better and less Gilligan's Island if we did! Over all - great, cute buy. Great price for them too!"
2,A bit weak on pragmatic advice,"I recall reading a book very similar to this in a senior level class I took about 4 years ago when I was getting my undergrad degree in computer science. I have to say that although it offers a good overview of how to develop software, it really shows the disconnect between what academics would like to see and how software development really works. In particular, the reader can feel free to skip any sections on metrics that deal with lines of code or function points-the metrics are not representative of any actual program, regardless of what they deal with: estimation, productivity, etc. The sections of the book that dealt with how to capture and analyze requirements were also fairly weak; most of the techniques they describe do not translate well to the real world. Unfortunately I can't recommend a better book for these as I have not found one yet."
5,Hot,Just picked it up and it is living up to the precedent set by MoM. Possibly even better than MoM (I haven't finished yet) but the first half of the record is worth the purchase price.
5,It's About Time...,"zion is one of the best emcees working out of the bay area right now..amp live is one of the best producers period...this album is very spiritual, political, and intelligent..a very diversified release...this is the best release this year so far..artists like zion i only come around so often..peep the grouch duo with zion on ""flow""...indeed a masterpiece..."
4,The model of the Master Teacher,"Drivetime Stories uses the model of the Master Teacher, Jesus, and His brilliant use of ""slice of life"" stories to shape the character of His listeners. It is a tremedous help for families on the go."
2,"Cute title, that's it","There are a few bits of useful information buried in this book but it wasn't worth it to me to wade through the awful writing style, disorganized format, lack of substance, timewasting information (""basic rules for alphabetic filing"" (p. 94), you need a trash can large enough to hold the trash (p. 51)), and more detail than you will ever want to know about the author's private life. There are plenty of really good books about reducing clutter, home organization and general organizing skills, and this is not one of them. I'm glad I didn't buy this book; it's going right back to the library."
3,Good book,"Good book. It was fun and easy to follow. The tips and addresses on getting off junk mail lists are worth the price. It's the first time I've ever seen instructions on how to get off of lists.Some new ideas, some old ideas I'd forgotten. Overall, it's a very useful tool."
5,Nice little camera,"This camera is small, about the size of a wallet. It's very easy to use, takes very clear pictures, and has many features. One is its ability to easily take short videos, which can be edited using PC/MAC software Minolta provides.I've had the camera for two weeks and the battery life seems to be fine.This is an excellent camera for beginners."
4,Nice quality & portability,"The small size of the camera makes it ideal for sticking it in a shirt pocket or jacket pocket. Quality at 3.2 megapixel is as good as any. Realistically, needs a larger sd card than the 16 mb that comes with it. The weak point appears to be the lense cover that is suppose to drop down to open when you turn the camera on. It stuck one time where I had to push it down and it sometimes does not fully drop down until you shake it down. It ALWAYS closes properly. A minor problem since you see the lens cover's edge when looking through the view finder if it has not dropped completely down, so you can make sure it is down before you take the picture. Overall, based on utility, durability, and ease of use, it is a very good digital camera."
5,Superb Micro Digital camera,After testing about 45 digital cameras for over 5 weeks I must say that this little beauty comes out best (with the marine case that you can buy as an accessory).It lasted longest (on battery) and preformed best and was one of the smallest (we only tested cameras between 3.0 and 3.5 MPixels).
3,"I want to like this camera, but...","Bought this camera after comparing to other small digitals. I wanted a camera small enough to take everywhere as I am constantly leaving my others behind and end up with no pictures. I think the engineering is incredible in this camera. Unfortunately, even after playing around with all the easy to use options, I cannot get the camera to take consistently good pictures in the situations that I find myself. I mostly agree with the other reviews that talk about poor picture quality. It seems to especially have problems with situations with some backlighting, lots of contrast (white shirt with dark jacket), too cold looking pictures when taken with the flash and a few others. Outdoor quality is much better. Speed is good but agree that it takes quite a while for first picture when using flash.Not sure what I'm going to do. At this point, probably will try to return the camera because, in the end, if I can't get good pictures easily, what's the point?"
4,Fast and friendly.,"This is a great little camera. Not sure I can say anything that hasn't been said already about it but overall I'm pretty happy with it.I always use the LCD screen as my viewfinder. The normal one leaves out a good deal (around the edges) of what will actually be captured in the image. A larger screen would be nice, but the pan and zoom in the review feature and the ability to remove all the on-screen notifiers help make up for the small screen.The lack of a normal AC adapter is sometimes annoying.I've had problems with blurred images and the flash will sometimes wash my images in blue. I have yet to figure out how to get around these problems.As mentioned in other reviews, this camera is super portable and starts up fast. It has all the features I'd want in a quick on-the-go camera. It's definitely not for more advanced photo shooting but as a handy vacation/amateur camera, it's awesome. The webcam feature produces much better images than most of the crappy webcams out there, too."
2,Minolta XT,I was disappointed with the image quality. My aunt's 1.2 mp camera took sharper pictures. I would probably never have noticed if I didn't have that comparison. I hope I'm just doing something wrong. The size is nice but not a good trade-off for picture quality.
4,X20 is a scaled down version of Xt,"This is to Superman2K3.I am not an owner of this product, but let me comment Mon this.While X20 should be a good staff, but it is essenially a scaled down version of Xt.It is 2 Mega Pixel instead of 3 of XT.It is slightly thicker than Xt, because of battery.The prism is replaced with mirror, which is cheaper.CCD is smaller.I am wondering which one to buy, because X20 has USB 2.0, and also as Superman2K3, battery operation is handy.Biggest drawdown would be it has only 2mega pixel and smaller CCD. I might wait 6 months."
4,best first digital camera,"I was very comfortable with my reflex 35mm film camera (Minolta 7000) and did not feel the urge to get a digital camera until now: entry level had poor quality image and the better were too expensive. The Minolta Dimage Xt changed my mind. It is easy to carry and takes good pictures. Only one con: The time between you press the shutter and the moment that the camera actually takes the photograph is not ""instant"", so many times I found that the picture I got was not exactly what I supposed to be taking. Now, after getting the idea, I am thinking for an upgrade."
2,Very Poor Picutre Quality,"I recently recieved the Minolta Dimage Xt as a present. Immeditately I was intrigured by the small design and groundbreaking internal optical zoom. After several pictures, I soon realized the the shape of the camera did not make up for the poor picture quality. All of the pictures appear grainy and under lighted. The flash is not effective even with close objects. The result is a dark, grainy, [...] picture. [...] Compared to all Canon cameras the Minolta Dimage Xt produces terrible images. My brother owns a Canon S200 and we took identical shots his appeared bright and rich with color. Mine was grainy, dark, and lacking depth or color to the face of the person. I have replaced my Dimage Xt with a Canon SD 100 which is great. I am completely satisfied. Canon cameras seem to produce great pictures. I would highly recommend buying one instead."
1,"Camera is slick, but picture quality bites","We had high hopes for this camera, but it only took a few pictures to convince us that the picture quality just isn't up to other brands i.e. Olympus, Sony, etc.The size and features are great, but photographs taken at night using the flash are reminiscent of old Polaroid photos. Purple-ish, uneven, lacking detail. We haven't taken any daytime outdoor color photos with it yet - but hey, why bother - there are just too many cameras out there that do an excellent job, so this one is going back!I'll put it this way - on a scale of 1 to 10 in this price range, the Sony Cybershot at $199 is a 9, just about any Olympus is a 9.5, and this camera rates about a 1."
2,Not what I hoped for....,"I foolishly snatched this book up as it was the first one I saw that covered SW2000 instead of the older versions. I honestly feel that they wrote this ""quick and dirty"" review of Solidworks just to be the first one out covering 2000 and to lure people like me. I only consider myself an intermediate user, however, for... all I got was a couple of little tidbits that I didn't already know. The rest was a very simplified, poorly edited review of the training manuals."
5,New Users,"This is the first time I ever wrote a book review - engineers do not like to write! But in this case I am making an exception. This is a great book. The book helped me to apply SolidWorks in my job. I liked it because I could follow every step. There are numerous pictures to assist the new SolidWorks user like me. The book quickly brought me up to speed on SolidWorks. It made me aware of the various project team issues which need to be addressed in a design environment. It provided real life situations between sales, engineering and manufacturing. This was great. This is the first book I've seen that addressed Top Down assembly. More books should be written this way.PS - The reproduction quality of the pictures could be improved."
5,User of SolidWorks,This is a great book. I would highly recommend this book for all user levels. I agree with the other reviews in that the authors present a clear and precise picture in using SolidWorks with a understanding of the real world. The sample reveiw questions and exercises in the back of each chapter are good. I enjoyed the information in Chapter 6 on Rapid Prototyping files and the Top down design approach in Chapter 7 is awesome.
2,"A workbook, NOT a reference book.",Beware! This is not a reference book for SolidWorks. It is nothing more than a workbook to guide you through some examples. No index hurts. It does not stand alone and is not worth the money in my opinion.
3,okay,"This makes my hair feel a little softer, but it does not make it smooth or shiny: meaning it still frizzes w/ it."
3,low battery,This is a great camera but which battery will keep its charge to take 50 pictures? I have tried 1800 mah & 2000 mah and the battery gets very low when 10 pictures are taken.
3,"Enclosed battery does work, though its power fluctuates","The included battery for this camera at first appeared to be a dud, as it displayed ""LOW BATTERY"" after only 4 pictures were taken. Though upon turning it on two weeks later, the cam indicated the battery was full. Two people I know who bought this same model told me they had similar experiences, though their batteries 'normalized' sooner than mine. Obviously for this reason I can't recommend this that highly but be aware the battery does contain a normal amt. of power.For my purposes-mainly photographing items to sell online- this camera is all I could ever ask for. The ease of use and quality of the pics are above par.In summary, by buying this, you're getting a good digital camera but be aware the battery needs a lot of time to 'break in'."
4,Not bad for a small recorder,"I bought this recorder to record a class I was taking. Lukily for me, my instructor had a loud voice so it recorded well. It has two speed selections. If you use the slower speed to get more tape time,it will get worse. It also has the V O R ""high"" ""Low"" selection and that's only to ensure continuous tape play when the voice gets soft. If your instructors voice is soft it may not work to well.I've seen other Sony models that are better and they take a regular cassette tape not these microcassette tapes."
4,"Cute, but way too much packaging!!!","My 8 year old daughter got this for her birthday and loves playing with it and ""mixing"" the lip gloss (kind of messy - the flavoring bottles are oily). My only real compliant is the overkill packaging. She got three Bratz Kidz dolls, three outfits and two playsets and it took me an entire movie (1.5 hours) to get them all out of their packages! What a waste of materials and a lot of my time. I think these packages could survive a nuclear attack! I don't think I have ever seen so many rubber bands, twist ties and threads all individually blister packed. It took an exacto knife and some very sharp scissors to get the job done and I ended up accidentally cutting a hole in one of the little outfits. Give us parents and our landfills a break MGA!"
4,Hymn Tune Names,"This book is a veritable storehouse of information about hymn tunes and their names. However, it has a very limited range of readers who are interested in the subject. For those who are interested, this book contains information that is not easily found from other sources and is well written with sources cited. It is too bad that it is our of print.Ruth Bowers"
1,Don't read this.,"I've tried over and over again to read this book. I have to put it down after like the 2nd page, it's horribly boring and I can't seem to go on reading because I'd rather poke my eyes out then to keep on reading it. The publishers reviews make it seem like a great book but PLEASE don't waste your money."
3,Historical and Informative,"Several others have already have given a wonderful summary of this book. My only issue I had is if you state ""top 20 things to see along the trace"", well get to the point, it goes on and on, plus the twenty has more than one thing to see, so the 20 becomes ~40 things to see."
5,Our trip on The Trace,"It was like traveling with our own expert! We started in Nasvhille and stopped at virtually all of the recommended top 20, either on the way down or the way back, and each was worth the stop. We stayed at a B&B; in Natchez, toured some of the awesome antebellum mansions and had a delightful time.The book had useful lists of places to stay along the trace - we stayed in Tupelo on the way down and Jackson on the way back at places Lynne listed. We even had occasion to need the emergency phone number for the Trace when we came upon 4 horses, in the dark, also traveling towards Natchez. The number was easy to find in the index.I am so glad that we waited until this book came out for our trip. We learned so much about the history of the region and it made the experience much more rich. This book really made the trip special for us - I HIGHLY recommend it! Thank you Lynne."
5,Wonderful info on trace,"I really enjoyed this book. The layout was easy to follow and made me anxious to take a trip on the natchez trace. Detail was written great and historical information was well described. The book was solid, not to large so you can easily take it with you as a great guide book."
4,Murda Mase is back with G unit !!,"if your a fan of Ma$e, then grab the mixtape of him with Gunit. hes back to being Murda mase before he got with p diddy and changed his flow. The rhymes are sick, with punchlines of a school yard bully. Dj whoo kid mixes great beats, and the G unit camp is also on the cd with Mase, providing a great number of tracks that will make you bump in the car"
3,Pretty good tape-for a chameleon!,"Mase always had talent, but his back and forth hurt his credibilty. 50's got a new toy soldier, it seems. He does have a point when he claims he ""fathered"" Fab and Loon;s style, but Fab is an independent respected MC. Loon smashed Mase on Street Wars Pt 14. Check it out."
1,How did this toy pass Quality Control?,"Cute packaging, cute idea. But the quotes are impossible to read. Even with reading glasses and a MAGNIFYING glass I was still unable to make out any of the words. Don't waste your money!"
4,good toy,"This is a great toy, but to me, it can become boring easily. This was a cool idea, and the answers are funny, but grim.Overall, this is a good toy. You should buy it and you'll be happy."
3,"Maybe 3 1/2 stars, but not 4","The plot was a good thought: Sarah discovers that her brother William has gone back to his theiving ways and she tries to find him and help him, unfortunantely he's in league with the Saint of Seven Dials and is wanted by police. The romance between Peter and Sarah is lacking. It's frustrating to have them both like each other, but neither is going to say anything or reveal any lies. I enjoy a good misunderstanding to twist the plot, but it just wasn't enough to keep me interested. Peter and Sarah, on their own, were very lovable characters, but in the end, not enough."
5,A Delightful Nostalgic Trip Through Days Gone By.,"I first set eyes on this gem of a book at my neighbours beach house whilst we were relaxing with a glass of red, and was entranced from the moment I picked it up. I am an avid collector of memorabilia and found this book to be excellent. I can identify with many of the items that were shown as being popular throughout the 70's, 80's and 90's. I regret that so much of what I had has long ago perished in rubbish dumps, and some of the items are so rare and collectable now. I found thememorablia from the 60's and earlier the most exciting, and loved reading about and looking at items that I hunt for in antique shops and markets! This nostalgic book is very hard, if not impossible, to put down once you start flicking through the pages, and is an absolutely essential purchase for anyone that has an interest in or is a collector of memorabilia. I cannot wait to order my copy!"
3,A brief overview of our 41st President.,"Well, I think Wicker is a little down on our 41st President. Wicker describes Bush Senior as the person that would do anything to get elected. He also states that Bush had few convictions or beliefs. I will echo what previous reviewers have already said, journalism is sometimes not good history. My own opinion is that Bush Senior was probably a better President than the two men who followed him. However, historians will determine that and not some skeptical New York journalist.The summary history of George H. W. Bush was nice but brief (excepting the critical remarks). The reader will get an overview history of Bush Senior in this book."
3,Revision needs revision,"It is a good story, it could be a great one. However the revision didn't improve it enough to get past a ""middle school"" authors use of language. I hope he keeps trying & gets a better editor next time."
4,Finally an origanl story!!!,"For years I have been searching for great fantasy/sci-fi. Finally, Drew Evans has fulfilled my wish. Granted the book needs a good editor however the story is amazing. The creatures are both deadly and ferocious. It is hard to believe that this world, so perfectly desgined is not real. From start to finsih I was hooked. Ill be looking and waiting for the revsied edition, you should too."
3,Just Okay,"Purchased these to workout at the gym and liked the price and fast delivery.Not too excited about the shorts though. Main complaint is that the elastic around the waist already feels like its well worn, doesn't fit very snug around my waist. Yes, I could return and try a size smaller, but I think the legs might be too tight than. I'll just keep them and continue looking.Thought the material was a little thin and they are a little longer than I'd prefer.Waahhh- Waaahhh...... Okay, I'm through whining now!"
1,not cut right,"I bought the Anvil and the Soffe and the Soffe is a much better style, cleaner cut. The anvil flares out at the crotch line to the thigh, while the Soffe is straight cut."
4,Anvil Mens Cotton Heavyweight Gym Shorts. 122,Funny things these shorts were standard issue from our Fire Department Clothing Store up until the last year or so. Then they went away. Boy did I miss them. These shorts have a heavy feel to them but seem to fit always just right. But the best is having a pocket available in them to hold your I-pod and such. Thank goodness I thought of Amazon when purchasing my own replacements. I simply typed in the information from the tags on the old worn out pair and soon I was back into workout heaven. The best pair of work out shorts I have ever owned. They are a bit on the pricey side as shorts go but they do have a tendacy to hold up to a lot of wear and tear.
1,built for little people,"THESE ARE NOT EVEN CLOSE IN SIZE TO THE SIZE ORDERED . SIZE 2XL WAS ORDERED AND IS EQUAL TO A SIZE L . ALSO IT IS ADVERTISED AS ""HEAVYWEIGHT'' BUT IS NOT ."
3,Not So Good,"I really like the simplicity of these. They are clear, with the once charcoal strip on the lid. It is much easier to see what is inside when you compare it to other Rubbermaid storage containers. However, these are not made of the same matter as the other Rubbermaid containers and can break."
2,Not worth it,"First of all, these hangers do not fit well on the closet pole. I had to force them on. Now that they are on, it is hard to slide them over or even take off. So, unless you have a thin closet pole, I do not recommend this item. I had to go and buy different hangers to replace the 3 packages I bought.The quality of the hangers are not very good either. Very flimsy."
1,Buyer bewear,These are no larger the blue insoles which totally kicked butt. These brown crappy insoles suck. And when I mean suck I'm not joking they have very little cushion the memory really does not work because there is a brown surface on top of the memory foam. And they have put a patch where your heal it which I think is terrible uncomfortable. There had to F up a good thing by no longer caring the blue memory foam insoles. By Dr. Scholl's. I think the Dr needs to go back to school and stop trying to reinvent the wheel with this new 50-dollar insoles are a bit pricey.
4,Dudes... where are we??,"Altamente detallado, tiene un lugar preferencial en mi escritorio y aunque no seas fan de Lost lo puedes disfrutar como una bella escultura, quiza el unico ""pero"" que le encuentro es que la palabr ""FATE"" en sus dedos este escrita con una maquina, se nota claramente por el tipo de letra, es lo unico que le resta esa sensación de ""hecho a mano"", fuera de eso es genial."
4,GETTING IN TOUCH WITH THE LAND,"This short book (only 87 pages) is the perfect sequel to Sarah, Plain and Tall. Sarah, once a mail-order bride from Maine, now is almost integrated into family life on the harsh prairie. But prolonged drought and other natural conditions deteriorate to the extent that she takes her instant children, Anna and Caleb, on a nostalgic (for her at least) trip back East, to share her roots with them.This story is narrated in the first person by Anna, daughter of farmer Jacob. But how to blend love of the ocean with love for the prairie--two opposing causes for nostalgia and homesickness? Sarah needs to learn to stop being a lark who merely hovers above the land, She must let her husband's love for her help her to grow into the kind of person who can write her name on the land as well. A thoughtful read for more mature readers. Companion volumes to complete the mail-order marriage. Read as a pair!"
4,Lyrical and Sincere,"Skylark by Patricia MacLachlan is the sequel to the author's award-winning Sarah, Plain and Tall, which was a favorite book and movie for me as a child. I picked up a cheap copy of the novel for my wife's classroom library, but before she took it, I read it on a whim, just wanting to see if it had the same sort of simple lyricism as Sarah, Plain and Tall. It did.In Skylark, Sarah and Jacob's farm has been suffering from a prolonged drought, putting their livelihoods in danger and laying a melancholy across the whole family. Sarah, especially, who has spent most of her life in lush Maine, finds herself longing to leave the dusty plains. Eventually, things get bad enough that she and Caleb and Anna leave for New England, wondering if they'll ever come back.On the whole, Skylark is a simple story, written with lyricism and sincerity that make it nearly as good as its predecessor."
3,Skylark,"Sarah came to the prairie from Maine to Marry Papa.But durring that summer,a drought turned the land dry and brown.Fires swept across the fields and coyotes came to the well search of water.So Sarah took Anna and Caleb back east,where they were safe.But on the other hand Papa would not leave his land.Maine was beautiful, but Anna missed her home ,and Papa.And as the weeks went by she began wondering what would happenif the rains will never come.Would they all still be a family."
3,Skylark,"This book is the sequel to ""Sarah Plain and Tall."" Sarah came from Maine to marry papa. But when a drought starts, Sarah takes Anna and Caleb to Maine and leaves papa. Will they ever become a family again? Read this book to find out."
5,GET RID OF THOSE COVERS!!!,"My wife came up with the idea of placing all my DVDs in binders...I rejected the idea at first, but then saw her point about how our family room started to look like a video store.Now our shelves have more space and doesn't look so awkwardly colorful--the binders actually match the color scheme of our house!I know the other review mentions that the binder doesn't stay closed, but that's only if you fill each page with two DVD discs--meaning every DVD the other reviewer has is a two-disc set. If you fill the binder up to its capacity, I can see that happening--but if you just have your average stack of DVDs, this is the product for you!The best thing about these binders: It's highly unlikely anyone will ask to borrow a DVD--especially those ""never-bring-them-back"" friends! Without the covers, they can't!Five Star product...all the way!"
3,For storage with movie booklet only!,"Very impressed with the quality of this item. Has three heavy wood sides so you know your DVDs won't get crushed if you stack these albums on their side. Dimensions are approximately 7 /12 x 9 1/4 x 4 inches. The catch is magnetic and we have had no problems with it popping open even storing ours with the binder/label up in a drawer. Note that you cannot add pages to this album. Each page consists of one side with a big clear plastic pocket for the movie booklet on one side and two black pockets on the back side. Not as useful if you don't have double DVD movies. Note that you cannot see the DVDs in the pockets so you cannot tell what movie it is without pulling the DVD out. We would not recommend this one for anyone who trades/swaps movies and does not have the movie booklet since it is difficult to tell what the movies are at a glance - you will need to come up with some other way of labeling them. 4 stars for quality of the product, 2 stars for ease of use."
2,Great Looking but doesn't stay closed!!,"I bought with the intent on organizing my DVD collection. They look great on a shelf, but once you load 64 DVDs into the cases they have a very hard time staying shut. I ended up having to put an elastic around the top and bottom in order for it to stay closed, which kinda defeated the whole purpose of buying them in the first place. I would stick to a case that zips around so you don't have this problem."
5,Great Organizer and Space Saver,"The CD/DVD Albums are great for organizing, only take up a fraction of the space and look great on the shelves."
5,Just a little fine print,"These albums have twenty pages, each of which can hold 2 discs. So I'll need a few more than I planned. But they are really nice albums. The pages can be fully utilized unlike the other albums I've tried."
4,Great binders!,These binders look good and my library takes up a lot less space now. I've had these binders for years now without any trouble. I only put one movie per page so do not overstuff the binder.
1,Camera LCD Screen Protector not worth it,"This screen protector, while it attaches pretty well without adhesives, makes it almost impossible to view the image on the LCD. (I used it on a digital camera on which the LCD screen is the viewfinder.) A small piece of cardboard is included to help you remove air bubbles, but the bubbles remain and you can never seem to eradicate them. I stopped using the screen protector after one day."
5,Expedition Canoeing sets the new standard,"Cliff Jacobson has once agian set a new standard for canoe tripping literature. In his most recent publication, Expedition Canoeing: A guide to Canoeing Wild Rivers in North America, Jabobson goes where no other book of this kind has gone. The book is a thorough and comprehensive collection of every aspect of expedition canoe travel. Jacobson covers everything from choosing a river to the meals that you can prepare in barren land, but what sets this book apart from others is that he includes his own novel concepts for the trail alongside time-tested techniques that only someone with his experience can add. This book will surely become the standard against which all other books of this nature will be measured. The book is an absolute must for anyone wishing to venture north with a canoe."
4,Worth the cash if you have it,"Good reference book, interesting read. The section on BEARS pays for the whole thing. Here I thought I was doing right, but now I find that I am lucky I ain't been et yet."
3,Informative,"This biography is very informative. The tone is calm and scholarly, the author does not get into any of the extremist debates about Islam.As a whole, the biography is sympathetic to Fadlallah, and reading it gives a good picture of his view of the world. This book will be appreciated by those who want to know more about the politics of the Middle East in the era leading up to the current war. But it is very much a work of political history - there is little information on private life and culture - I did think that the author could have written more about that."
4,Lora Leigh,"Love the book. This is the first of her wolf breed series and I have been looking for these books for a while. Loved the suspense and ""instant attraction"" between the male and female leads. Suspense, mystery and love intermingle in this alternate reality romance. Look forward to the next one."
5,favorite lora leigh story so far....,I am a Lora Leigh fan and this book is my favorite story from her so far. Great and very touching story...If you like Lora Leigh then you'll definitely love this one.
5,a keeper,"i choose this book originally because it described a soldier, a fighting machine broght back from death by elizabeth. However i bought this book years ago in paperback and i had to have it in my kindle. It was just as good and exciting the second time around. I bought this book for my kindle because there are times when i choose books that are ok, but after you've read so many ok books, you really want to read a keeper. This book is the third of a series, i am presently reordering and reading these books in sequence> They are all keepers"
5,Wonderful,I love her books. They are so good I can't put them down. I buy all her books if I can and I have loved them all.
2,My least favorite Lora Leigh novel...,"I like Lora Leigh's books for the steamy, hot sexual scenes and believable suspense. However, this book made me uncomfortable several times because the sex between Elizabeth and Dash always felt one step away from being rape rather than being consensual. Dash was completely domineering and it felt to me like he often forced his ""mate"" into uncomfortable sexual experiences. He threatens to sodomize her for not following his orders, he spanks her when he is mad at her and he gets off on dominating her. He finally does sodomize her until she passes out...sorry, none of that is my idea of a loving relationship. This goes down as my least favorite (so far) Lora Leigh novel."
4,Great balance,Lora Leigh is one of my favorite authors and this book has just the right balance of romance and heat! As always Lora Leigh leaves you excited about the next new novel in her series
3,not what I expected,"This book is a hail to the soldiers! And it's a great book in that regard. It's sweet. Soldier recieved letters from little girl- then off to protect her and her mom. But as far as being a 'Breed' book that I was expecting. Nope.Yes, he talked about smells. Yes, once he tells Elizabeth to not let others touch her. Maybe it's too early in the series for Lora to have talked a lot about the Breed stuff. The sex scenes did involve the uh, species stuff- which was a surprise to both of them.But, if you are looking for a lot of mate stuff- won't be found here."
2,Atheistic Superstition,"Remember seeing all those pictures of various ""hominids"" lined up according to the supposed progression from apes to humans? According to Henry Gee's 2001 book, In Search of Deep Time, such scenarios are works of complete and utter narrative FICTION, unsupported by any credible understanding of the fossil record. According to Gee, all of the ""hominid"" fossils that have any bearing on human ""evolution"" can be stored in one small box. This is all of the evidence we have of human ""evolution""--one small little box of fossils supposedly representing a time period of multiple millions of years. And we have more more and better fossils for ""hominids"" than for any other class of species, according to The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Human Evolution.Evolution was, is, and always will be, nothing more than atheistic superstition."
3,"Hey, wait a minute Mr. Geffen","Mr. Geffen liked to believe that bringing together the qualities of John David Souther, Chris Hillman and Ritchie Furay would guarantee success. It wasn't to be. Their debut was o.k., but nothing more than that, and they vanished into thin air after their completely mistaken second album, appropriately named 'Trouble In Paradise'. Still, some 25 years later, the debut album of the SHF Band sounds o.k., nothing more, nothing less, but if you really look and listen to it, it's a waste of talent."
5,couldn't put it down,"Unlike so many books with golf themes, this one doesn't get bogged down in mystical bunk about finding the golfer within or caddies with supernatural powers. It's a gripping (sorry, no golf pun intended), straight-ahead story about a kid from Long Island who makes it to the big time, with a lot of serious obstacles thrown in his way. Funny, full of drama, and -- I'll bet -- very close to the way things really operate on Tour. If you need a gift for the ""real"" golfer on your list, this is the one!"
4,Synthetic-Aperture Radar and Electronic Warfare,Es un buen libro. Muy claro en las explicaciones y detalles aunque no lo recomiendo para personas entendidas en el tema.Muy buen material introductorio en la Tecnologias de Radares de Apertura Sintetica.
2,Not typical Isham,"The liner notes to this CD say it all. The director of the movie, a staunch Isham fan, admits putting the composer under a very difficult timeline to develop this soundtrack. The result seems obvious, this is one of the least inspired of all Mark Isham's works and very disappointing. Not much real music here, just background sound. If you are trying to choose between this CD and another Isham release, skip this one."
1,A Dud!,"I bought the Lion, Tiger, and Rhino for my three kids, and they malfunctioned right from the start. I even shelled out another $12.00 for new batteries thinking maybe the ones they came with were running low, but even that didn't help! They work very intermittently, though most of the time they don't work at all. Very frustrating for my children! I'm returning the ones I bought."
1,Microid Misery,"gave these one star only because 0 was not a choice in the survey!! looked really neat on tv but a real disappointment upon purchase...didn't realize they only had approx. 40 min. of power when bought but didn't even run that long... if they had been $.79 instead of $7.99 maybe I wouldn't have felt so cheated! Tomy has had alot in the past that was worth the expense, but not this time!!! am also returning for refund ....."
4,Nice quality construction; great color,"This puppy polo is a nice quality shirt; I bought it for my 3 month old yorkie boy. The only downside of the shirt is that the fabric covers his tummy, and in turn can get wet when he does his business. It needs to be rolled up if he has to go to the bathroom."
3,Blah...,"I really like the simplicity of these. They are clear, with the once charcoal strip on the lid. It is much easier to see what is inside when you compare it to other Rubbermaid storage containers. However, these are not made of the same matter as the other Rubbermaid containers and can break. Considering the cost of these compared to others, I would have expected better."
3,I wish this book was more comprehensive,"I bought Liz Greene's other books on Saturn (a new look at an old devil) and Neptune (the astrological neptune...) and found them both to be so comprehensive...detailed background mythology as well as contemporary references, plus detailed information on positions, aspects, the whole works...I couldn't put them down and they helped me to understand the influences of these planets. I was really hoping this book would do the same but I guess I should have known that wouldn't be the case since it is in the Seminars format. Every time it came to something I really wanted to know they said...well, you all already know all about that so we don't need to go into detail...yes, please! That's why I bought the book. I got some helpful information out of it but not what I was hoping for."
2,"You will know how to do it, but you won't know how to explain it","First off, this book adequately teaches you differential equations. It's clear and concise - all except for one thing. WHERE ARE THE EXPLANATIONS!? Each section just jumps into examples without first explaining important concepts. I tried to find out exactly what a Laplace transform was, but all the book told me was that it was similar to a derivative, they both transform one function into another type of funciton. YEAH, THANKS.I know how to do everything, I just don't know exactly WHAT I'm doing."
3,as good as any other math textbook,"I had a very good professor for my Differential Equations class, so it may have tainted my view of the textbook, but overall I thought it was a good book. The problems varied from easy to difficult, and the solutions manual was a lifesaver. Although the solutions manual does not always explain steps in the problems very well, I liked it better that way: it forces students to think for themselves, rather than just providing the answer and allowing them to copy the process. Whenever the class lecture was unclear, the respective textbook examples always helped a great deal."
1,huh? sorry i fell asleep,"please! have the producers of this edition forgotten that its supposed to be a PLAYBOY!! i have purchased many PB dvd's before but i have NEVER seen anything this boring. there are no sexy moves by shannon tweed and she talks for more than 30 minutes....blah blah...thats not the reason i bought this DVD!! i only have one suggestion for those who would like to get this dvd...DON'T!! unless you are a die hard fan of tweed, DON'T WASTE your money on it!!"
2,Get Up Offa That Thing,"I don't even know if this is the real James Brown. I expected the actual songs, not the concert versions that have that terrible audio and are hard to hear. This is not what I expected."
5,VFP Strikes Again,"Veterans For Peace is in the forefront of the vast majority waging peace in our times. If you have a sense of humor you'll be putting this book down often due to uncontrollabe laughter. If you don't (have a sense of humor) you'll laugh anyway. If you are a peace monger, send this to your congresspersons. If you are from Minnesota, they probably have it already."
1,Not Funny!!,"Some people may not get that this is a far left leaning assault on traditional values. I was expecting a tongue-in-cheek commentary of typical American life, instead I got an insulting attack on the values that made this the greatest country in the world. If you are a fan of left wing nuts, you'll probably enjoy this attack piece. For all others, don't waste your money on this."
2,"Nice book, but print is too small for the pianist","You can't argue with the brilliance of Ben Folds. And I appreciate what this book is trying to do. It's much like the score to the Beatles' works-- all parts-- piano, drums, bass-- are transcribed.My beef is that as a pianist I was much more interested in seeing the piano transcriptions. The bass and drum transcriptions add nothing to my enjoyment. But because they're on the same page, everything is printed very small and you have to turn pages frequently.Also frustrating: The multiple codas and del signo notations. In other words, you're playing along, squinting to read, and there's a D.S., telling you to go back to the sign and then play to the first coda. Then you have to find the first coda. Then you have to find the second sign. Etc, etc.Bottom line: I've used the book as a reference. it's helpful to understand his chord voicings and licks, but if you want to play through the piece from start to finish, this isn't the right book for you."
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE IT !!!,Everytime I wear this musk people would stop me to ask where did I get it from ... This musk stays with you even after you shower ... My Mom wore it when I was little and I never forgot that smell ... LOVE IT so much !!!!!
5,Great price,"I've used this fragrance for many years, and it is increasingly difficult to find in stores. Buying on Amazon was easy, delivery was quick and the price was great."
4,For King & Country - A tribute to Airborne veterans,"I have thoroughly enjoyed this well-researched book from start to finish. There is a tremendous amount of detail in this book and the author clearly knows his stuff. The inclusion of veterans' accounts is great.Most people reading historic accounts of WWII will come across page after page of black and white photos of the men at arms involved so to see the uniforms, insignia and various kit carried by the airborne forces during this period in colour is a revelation.Harlan Glenn has devoted a lot of time and effort into researching this book and it serves as a fitting tribute to the men he has written about."
4,Recognition of the world's greatest race horse sire.,"Northern Dancer was not recongnized as a great race horse until after he stopped racing. His greatest contribution was in the stud barn where his legacy lives on today. This book recognizes the greatness in this horse and in his offspring. I own a Northern Dancer grandson and wanted to learn more about him. In this book, I got everything I wanted except perhaps more information about some of his greatest sons, such as Lyphard. However, I feel like I know something about Northern Dancer and why he changed thoroughbred racing stock in North America forever."
5,MANNNNNN!,"THE BEST ALBUM IVE EVER HEARD UNDER TEAR DA CLUB UP THUGS. I AM A DIE HARD 3-6 FAN BUT, THEIR BEATS ARE FORM ANOTHER WORLD. I DONT CARE IF YOU LIKE NY STYLE MUSIC TO D. SOUTH TO WEST COAST. THIS CD IS A MUST FOR ANYONE. THEY SOUND LIKE THEY ARE MEMPHIS BUT WITH A ATL STYLE(FROM ALABAMA). STOP READING AND COP THE CD.-ALAN"
4,The next UGK....foreal!!!,"If you slipped on their 1st album, then you missed an instant southern classic. Well they have come with that fi-fi once again! It amazes me that they can have 17 COMPLETE tracks, and still have such a variety of sounds on all of the songs. My favorites are ""Woodgrain"" and ""Gangsta"", because they are the hardest and grimiest. And everytime I want to say that Big Pimp is outshining his partner, back come the Gangsta with somethin else slick to say. these boys just compliment each other so well, just like Bun and Pimp C, Ball & G, and Dre and Big Boi. Don't sleep on these boys from Da Gump!!!"
4,ain't no fluke,"first off i jus wanna say congratulations to dem dirty boys. Y'all joint is straight bangin, keep it up. i know it wuz probably a lot of people out dere like dese 'Bama boys ain't gon make no waves in this business. Shut y'all the hell up, didn't dey. dey cd is tight don't lie. Proud of y'all cats. Keep reppin da 'Gump and dat class of '95 Carver."
2,It is cheap,"One game and it didnt suvive. I thought they would survive a shot but no, there is a crack in one of my pods...."
4,Not so bad.,"Honestly I was expecting it to be so much more painful than the earlier reviews made it seem. Does it hurt? yes. But I would classify it more as a painful prickle that can be dealt with at mind over matter. With that being said.. let's just say that the thicker the hair is, the more it hurts. At this point I can only use it on my legs. And it never leaves them quite as smooth as shaving but the results last so much longer. Braun has an equal to this product that's $20 more because it has an attached light. Originally I didn't think it'd be worth $20 extra for a light but I tried my friend's and it helps me find missed hairs sooo much easier. Either way, if you're someone who has a fairly normal pain tolerance I think this product will be worth your money."
4,Good product,I bought this a gift for my wife and she is very satisfied and happy with this.It works as expected and the delivery was on time.My wife Will recommend it
3,Grabs thick hair but not thin,"Overall the epilator removed all hairs from the legs and arms. However, when at an angle, sometimes it cannot pull out the hair or you need to run over the angled area many times (ESP the leg). Thin hairs are still present after using the epilator so it does a better job on thicker hair. As for the pain, it's not too bad. The first few times will leave your skin feeling tingly, but you get used to it."
3,If only..........,"This product works extremely well.....if only the power supply were made of more durable materials. I own this model and the model prior to this, the power pack on both gave out after two years of use. It shouldn't be an issue since a replacement pack sets you back about $9.00.....however it seems to be forever on backorder, believe me I know. I've been waiting four months now and it's still on back order, even I have a burnout point - no more being brand loyal. The epilady works just as well, and I owned one of those for over ten years, I know what I'm talking about!!!!!!!!!"
3,Not as good as I expected,"This is my first epilator, so I don't have much to compare it with. However, it wasn't as efficient as I expected after reading all the rave reviews this little machine gets. It generally takes 30 minutes or more for me to do both my legs, as I have to go over the same spot numerous times. In addition, probably close to 25% of my leg hairs actually break off instead of getting pulled out, which leaves me with stubble. My leg hair seems to grow back very fast, so I need to use this a little more frequently than once a week, but it still beats shaving! The first time was extremely painful for me (I had never done waxing or anything related), but since then the pain has been minimal. Overall I suppose this epilator is better than most on the market, but it didn't quite meet my high expectations."
4,"Good purchase, bad start!","This is my first epilator, so you can guess..I had a bad start. I had been wanting to buy a good hair removing system for sometime, and after much searching and reviewing, I landed on this product. The very first try turned out to be quiet a challenge. I found it much more painful than waxing. It takes a long time to get used to the pinching sensation. The pain recedes, but it remains till the next day. But the result was amazing. The skin was smoother than I have had after shaving/hair removing creme, etc. The second time over, I felt less pain, except in areas where I hadn't gone over the first time. One has to go through parts of skin many times over, but in the end it was worth it! I also found that taking a shower before epilating helps. It does give rise to ingrown hair as others have mentioned it.If you are first time epilator user like me, all you need persistence and patience.Good Luck!"
1,"It cuts the hair, it doesn't pull from the root!","I have used many epilators for many years, this is the worst ever. I have to use it every other day because is just like shaving. Dont't buy it!"
2,"So loud, few blades, and only good for legs",The title says it all. This just wasn't as good of an epilator as I was looking for. It can't do bikini or armpit. You're better off getting a different one.
1,"Breaks off hairs, leaves stubble.","This product breaks off hairs, which may make the hair be gone for a day or two, but then stubble will return,and when you try to remove the stubble, turns out it's not long enough for removal. For the price you're paying, proceed at your own risk and most likely dissapointment."
2,Too noisy,"Unlike other models I tried, this Silk-epil epilator is not a good product. It is not suitable for sensitive zones (although the box speaks to the contrary) and it is extremely noisy. When using it is impossible to do anything else, because the noise is so high that it even gives you a head-ache. I would definitely not recommend this product, because is not even cheap."
1,Time Consuming,"I have been trying this product for a month now I didn't want to knock it before I gave it a chance. Here it goes #1 time consuming you really have to have so much time on your hands to remove the unwanted hair, #2 ingrown hair like crazy even if you exfoliate during warm showers, #3 skin is never ever smooth feels prickly like when hair grows back after a few days after shaving, #4 you have to repeatedly go over one spot to get rid of most of the hair, #5 the protective cover always I mean always falls off, #6 OMG the bikini area and upper thighs hurts like crazzzzy it feels like bees stinging you over and over I can bare pain but not that kind of pain, and I have waxed my bikini area before. Over all this product is a waste of time and money I wonder if I can return it and get my money back after a month well I need to check up on that."
5,Addictive medieval torture device.,"At first, it hurts. Then, it starts to feel good. But most importantly, my legs don't have to be shaved every day anymore. They aren't as silky as when I used a razor, but they also don't get such super sharp stubble."
2,Not that great,"I actually did tons of reviewing and research on different types of epilators before i bought this particular one. That being said i am highly dissapointed with the performance that I've received. Yes the Braun picked up the more visible hairs but my legs never seemed to be ""soft"" - I could always feel those little stubbles all over my legs even if i spent 30 minutes going over with the Braun on each of them. Also the Massaging rollers and EfficiencyPro cap didn't work at all. Massaging rollers actually were a little ticklish for me and the efficiencypro cap left little lines of scratches all over my legs. All in all the only good thing about this epilator was that i've never gotten any cuts, nicks, or burns. I've gotten alot of ingrown hairs instead."
1,Sadly disappointed,"I do not like stubble on my legs at all. I shave daily. Unfortuntely, this product only works with longer hair on the legs. It did not work at all for stubbble. I was sadly disappointed, but this product will not work for me."
1,No Pull Tool,"Simply put, don't buy this. I have tried over 15 epilators and this one is at the bottom of my list. It does not grasp very well nor pull the hair very well. I am not very hairy and I would say my hair is fine to medium."
2,You're Gonna be over paying!,"Just to let you guys know, I bought this at a walgreens on sale for like 20 bucks. Granted, this was a few years ago, and I haven't really used it because it hurts, but still its a little too expensive here."
4,A good alternative to waxing.,"I love this product. I've been using various models for the past 7 years and cannot live without it. I hate waxing and hardly have the time and patience for it. The silk epil saves me a lot of time. If you use it on hair that is not too long, it doesn't hurt very much. The only thing it doesn't prevent is in-grown hairs."
5,My Braun Epilator works very well.,"I purchased the Braun SE3170 Silk-epil SoftPerfection Epilator and had it delivered within 4 days, even though at the time of purchase, I filled it out to be sent using just regular shipping. It works great for me and I am really happy with it, since I have facial hair that must be taken care of about every other day. This product is easy to operate and clean. Well worth the money!!!"
4,great for the money,I read some complaints of painful use but I have not experienced that.If there were a smaller trimmer attachment this would be 6 stars product!
4,WOW I AM ACTUALLY SHOCKED!,"I honestly thought i would have to get something to accompany this to be totally hair free but I am very pleasantly surpised by the results. I was also pleased that it did not need batteries. I have been having serious chin hair growth problems since my daughter was born, and even though this product is supposed to be for legs , it worked great on my chin. It was actually smooth. ~warning~ if you are not used to plucking this may not be the best product for you, But it was perfect for me."
4,It's is a really good product!,"The first time I used the epilator I did feel the pain, but it isn't unbearable or anything. The advantage was that I didn't feel any hair for over two weeks afterwards. The only other downside is I really have to plan for ingrown hairs. The product manual says to watch out for this and talks about ways to prevent them. I just use a exfoliating scrub in the shower now and moisturize as usual (I moisturize a lot anyway). It's really a great product! Try it if you can."
4,Good product,"I really like this epilator. It did hurt more than I expected the first time I used it, but I was very impressed with the results. Very smooth legs, much smoother than with a razor. I will definitely continue to use this product"
4,Great product!,This product is great! I can't say that it is pain free but if you were used to waxing you can easily handle the pain. It is very practical and easy to use. I strongly recommend it!
5,say good bye to NAIR,I DID NOT THINK THIS THING WAS GOING TO WORK BUT it does i just got it to day the pain is not that bad i dont think so i love this u have to get one!!!!!!!!!!
4,awesome product!,"i would rate this 5 stars but i instead gave it a 4 because some may complain of the pain that epillating brings.-when i first eppillated i wanted to cry, especially when i did it on my hairy legs, i could only do portions at the time..-its great for people with thick leg hair due to shaving, the epilator pulls the hair from the root making it grow back thinner and slower, much better than shaving every day.-i use this product on my underarms, legs and arms. I DO NOT use it on the bikini area despite the face that they say you can, i can not endure that kind of pain, no matter what.good product, nice alternative to shaving and waxing (which is so messy)"
1,Very painful and takes a long time,"I purchased this unit after having read many conflicting reviews, some stating it was very painful, to little or no pain. It seemed from this site and several others that the consensus was that there is pain associated with it, but tolerable depending on your pain threshold.Boy was that wrong! I have a very high pain threshold and found using this to be so painful that I had to stop after a 1/2 hour. During that time, I was able to remove hair from an area the size of 2 sq inches. Every comment about the process being slow is true. Because it still had not removed all the hair in that area.I tried going slow, fast, adjusting the angle, using both speeds, and none of those things made it any better.Save your money, and don't torture yourself like I did!"
4,Better than shaving,I have fair skin and course hair so this little number makes a big different. I never have epilated before so it does hurt the first few times but after a while you get used to it. This one works really good. It does not get all the hair so you may have to re do your legs the next day. The only reason I did not give it a 5 because it does not make you feel smooth like shaving. So I wait about 3 days and use a regular razor for the little hairs it cannot get for a smooth feeling. Plus adding moisture everyday helps. (Just don't moisture on the day you epilate or the day after)I have not used it on bikini or underarms yet.
4,Good Product,"It's a good product as far as epilators go.It hurts about as much as the others and is just as loud, but it works well (and that's the point, isn't it?)"
4,Happy,"This epilator works like a champ, no problems with order, delivery or function. Only wish it did not hurt!"
3,good but not powerful enough,this is a good product. i have fine hair and i wish that this pulled the hair out stronger. i use it without the attachments for faster hair removal.
2,Noise machine,"This machine is not like the previous one, or maybe mine didn't come in good condition. It's very noisy and annoyning. It didn't have the pink case to put it on it either. Try to get a different one."
2,OUCH!,"This may be an amazing product- but it hurts like crazy. Basically an epilator is a machine with multiple rotating tweezers. You run the machine over your legs (or wherever) and the tweezer claws grab the hairs and pull them out. Some people may not be bothered by this, but I found it almost unbearable. I tried taking pain medication before using this and it didn't help much. It really hurts.Also, this machine is very noisy and makes a loud buzzing/grinding noise. I think that makes it even more intimidating.However the effects were GREAT on the parts I did complete. It lasts at least twice as long as shaving and is much less messy than waxing. Also, I think this Epilator is very well designed. I love the color and it is quite easy to clean.You have to have quite a bit of courage to use this, but if you do the results are great."
3,ow,"I waxed for about a year and I was not ready for the pain. I cannot use this past my knees. I cannot bring myself past that point. It works pretty well, but I do find in some places it breaks the hair rather than pulling it out."
4,So Glad I bought it!,I use to go through razors a lot. I bought battery powered shavers and it became a bit pricey. I like the Braun Soft Perfection Epilator even though I have to shave a little longer. It is worth not having to shave as often as I did before.
1,doesn't work and casing gets hot,"This epilator doesn't work. There were a few hairs pulled out, but despite slow, methodic, and repeated motion of the epilator over my legs, they were still hairier than I expected at the end. I also dislike that the handle gets hot. I held it in the middle of the handle so I could better direct the recommended 90* angle and motion, and the side closer to the tweezers got uncomfortably hot. I also thought there would be a reservoir or something into which any pulled hair would be deposited, but there is no such thing. I found a few hairs attached to the handle by static electricity, and brushed a very few out of the tweezer assembly; so any other hairs that were pulled must have been deposited on my floor (which is carpeted; I didn't look, I just vaccuumed). This was my first (and last) electric epilator, so perhaps my expectations were unrealistic. I was looking forward to the end of waxing, but this piece is not as quick or effective."
3,"Great at first, but...","It worked great at first, but it seems to have lost its effectiveness after a few months of use... I'm not sure if you're supposed to replace the heads, but there don't seem to be any replacements for sale. For $45 it's not bad, but I was expecting to have it for a lot longer than that...."
4,"Works, but not perfect","I would say that the epilator definitely works for the thicker hairs on my legs and body, but not well for finer hairs, such as on my thighs, etc. It never gets all of the hairs unless I spend a LONG time on it, but I use it regularly for my legs (about every week), and then shave in between if I need a smooth day for some special occasion. The epilator does get a little warm if I run it for a long time, but it hasn't been much of a problem. I definitely like it and would recommend it, even though it isn't perfect to keep you perfectly smooth."
3,Bring Back the Old Model,I like the older model of the Braun Silk epil. I don't like the new style head of this model. It is more painful to use.
3,Common Epilator,"It's a common epilator. You can't expect of it to do too much (hint: its price). I don't have much to say. As long as it does its job, it's okay. Buy it as a basic staple."
5,Glad I tried it again!,"Many years ago, I got one and hated it. It hurt! I decided to give it a try again. There was NO hair pulling & no breaking out of my skin. I'm over 60, so I ""pulled"" the skin tight in a few sagging places and shaved with ease. The legs went so well, I tried under my arms and no problems there either. I read EVERY instruction, and to really test it I did NOT put any lotion on my skin after use. No Problems... Honest"
3,Louder But Not Better,"This new Braun is not as good as my last one. Besides being much louder, the rotating heads don't take out some of the roots as did the old one; it merely chops off hairs instead of yanking the hairs by the roots. I get more bumps under my skin as a result. It's new but not improved!"
5,Great hair removal solution!,"I've never tried an epilator before, but I wanted a hair removal method that wouldn't compromise the tan that I spent so much time and money developing. This product had great reviews, so I tried it. And it was great! It is simple to use, and not very painful. My underarms and legs stay smooth for many days, and I even use it on my bikini area. (But beware, the bikini area hurts very much!!!) The results are totally smooth, and my tan legs remain tan after epilating. Great product."
5,The best hair removal product out there,"For any women struggling with too much unwanted hair on their legs, there is no better product. I won't lie, it hurts a bit but after the first time it gets better. The tips are to do it right after you take a shower and when your hair is not too long. It's better than messy at-home waxing and shaving every day, you avoid the stubble and it feels as smooth as a professional wax, without the cost. I lived in Europe for a number of years, most women there use it and I was always disappointed that the US didn't have an equivalent product. I am so happy to find an epillator here at last!"
3,Could be better,"This is the first epilator I've used and I'm not very impressed with it. It works okay but some of the hairs seem to break off instead of being plucked out.The attachments are good for getting used to the feeling by only allowing a few hairs to be plucked at a time. Also they're good if your scared to touch this loud machine to your skin. It does sound a little scary but it doesn't hurt very much, just don't let the hair grow too long.I've owned this epilator for about a month and I still use it but plan on buying a better one."
2,Why?,"It's not hard to shave my legs everyday, so why did I think I needed this? I still shave my legs about once every three days. Honestly, I would rather just shave everyday. It would be easier, but I paid a pretty penny for this thing, so I'm going to use it!Yes, it will pull the hair out of your legs, but it is a very tedious process that involves going back over the same spot many times, even after exfoliating.As far as the ouch factor....legs - not badbikini/underarms - badanywhere else - moderatly bad to bad.It's not so much that it doesn't work, but the money, effort and pain are just not worth it. By the time I get to my second leg, I'm ready to give up!"
4,not bad...,"i got this after having an emjoi for 10 yrs that finally broke. it's honestly not bad, especially considering that it's half the price. sometimes it only manages to cut the hairs, not yank them out, but i found that with the emjoi, that happened too. so far, no real complaints."
3,"All Right, But Not The Best","This product was not gentle on my legs. It hurt, even with the massaging attachment. Plus, it did not get all of the hairs on the first pass, and seemed to cause me to get more ingrown hairs. I gave it three stars because when it finally gets the hairs, they do not come back for a while. If you are sensitive to pain, though, this is not the epilator for you."
1,Maybe for tough skinned people,"I thought I had tough skin and could handle the pulling of this, but I couldn't. I tried it on my legs and it just hurt too bad that I couldn't use it anymore. I'd suggest getting waxed instead, it takes less time then having a few hairs pulled out at a time."
2,Not worth it,"I read the reviews and followed what most people said to do (use after showering, exfoliate, make sure the hair isn't too long or short, etc), but it just wasn't what I expected. It would never pull all the hairs out; it always left stubble, which I then would go back over with my razor. I just didn't see the point of using it when I had to use my razor anyways.I gave it two stars because of the hairs it did get they seemed to not grow back as fast."
3,Did not remove all the hair,"I've been using Remington epilator for years, but then I decided to give Braun a try. It was very slow, I had to go over and over each spot, as it was leaving a lot of hair behind - I tried it with the Efficiency Pro clip which did not help. It did not hurt much, but then I am used to epilating. Can be used on bikini line as well as legs, I didn't try it anywhere else."
4,quite satisfied,"I found this epilator to be as effective as promised. Sure it was painful at first, but I think I've gotten more accustomed to it the more I use it. Sometimes the hairs break instead of being pulled out. Overall though, I'm nice and smooth for about 4 weeks and the hair that grows back is much lighter and more fine. I have used it on my legs and armpits and I would recommend it for anyone who really wants less hassle in those areas. It's fast, easy, and a friend who is used to waxing found it completely painless. I'm a bit of a wuss, but even so, I am glad I decided to get this product."
5,Love this so far,"I ordered this after my last one (a battery-charged one) finally crapped out on me. I LOVE THIS ONE in the fact that, because it's electric, I don't run out of power in the middle of doing my legs and that it does a great job! I've only had to use it once in the past month because it did such a great job! And my boyfriend loves it because I have smooth legs in the morning AND at night! I would recommend this for anyone who has used an epilator because they're sick of shaving their legs every day! And it's pretty!"
2,"Scratchy, noisy & not powerful enough","I do not have coarse hair, yet it takes MANY (i.e. too many) passes to remove the hair on my lower legs. Additionally, the tip scratches the skin easily. Finally, for the noise it makes, this gadget should be 10 times more powerful.I bought this model because it was not very expensive, but mostly because the Epilady brand had not resurfaced yet."
3,I think it was worth it,"I have been using the Braun Soft Perfection SE3170 for about a month now and while it is not perfect I do think it is a good product. The first time I used it it hurt like crazy but after that not so much. I have not been thrilled with how it works on my legs, it seems like I always have the feeling of stubble. However, it works great on my underarms. I have very dark hair and nearly transparent skin so shaving really never looked good. If I only use it for my underarms I think the Braun Soft Perfection SE3170 is worth the purchase."
3,Learn to love it,"Although it's a bit painful at the beginning, the pain nulls down - just like waxing I guess. It's a great product. After the first time I used it on my legs, it caught all my hair, although I still felt some little fine hairs that were left behind. It also didn't do a very good job at getting the thigh area because the hair doesn't grow as thick there. I did shave after and then my legs were actually smooth for about 2 weeks. I'm definitely going to keep using it because it's so much more convenient than shaving and cheaper than waxing. The one thing I didn't like was that it does not catch the hair as it pulls them out. I was doing this in my room and all the hair ended up on my floor. Next time it will be done in the bathroom!"
3,msmokey2rv1,"This product works well on some areas of the body but not others. I find this rather curious but nonetheless, rather true. It works well on the stomach and bikini line, but not the legs."
3,Does a good job but the cord goes bad,"This is the second Braun epilator I have owned and I've had the same thing go wrong with both units. The cord/connection goes bad. If you jiggle the cord at the connecting point you can get it to keep going but as soon as you let go, it goes off again. So, good product but it only lasts about 1-2 years."
2,"just broke hair, did not pull it out","I may have read this in another review, but this item just broke off my hair and did not pull it out. I have fine blond hair, so maybe that is why it did not work. I think the makers could make recommendations regarding the kinds of hair it works on best."
2,Better ones on the market.,"Has to be held at a perfect angle before it works underarm. Since your arm curves, this is virtually impossible making epilating take a much longer time. I had a Remington that did not do this. The Remington was ancient and finally burned out. Also, the head is not big enough, making this take even longer. Would not buy again."
3,misses hair,The good news is this gadget really isn't that painful (however I would put up with a moderate amount of pain if I didn't have to shave anymore). The bad news is it misses about 1/2 of the hair on my leg. I followed the instructions and used the attachements and no attachements but it would not pick up all the hair (I have very fine leg hair). The hair it did get it was very effective in not growing back for 6 weeks. I will continue to play around with it but I am still back to razors.
2,Not the best,I have been using braun epilators for 14 years now and this is VERY DISAPPOINTING! I didn't believe that this brand can make a bad epilator but here it is ... it doesn't work as well as my previous ones.
1,Very bad product,"I don't know why this product has received so many good reviews because I bought this and it really sucks.CONSIt is unbearably painful.For all the pain you'll receive, 4 weeks of ""no hair"" is not worth all the pain.This product skips lots of hairs, which is why I don't recommend it."
3,I don't think so,"Basically, what this product does is it pulls your hair out one by one (or maybe 4-5 at a time). And you can look forward to more in-grown hair than you thought was possible.Does it work? Oh yeah it works alright. It really ""works"" and regardless of the lenght of hair it will pull it out from the roots.Does it hurt? More than you can imagine!Bottom line: if you're hairy, you're in for a painful ride."
2,painful machine,"I have an 15 year old Braurn Epilator, that works better than this new one and less painfull and this new Eplitar tend to scratch your skin as well."
4,Fast moving.,Third book I have read by Rucka and all of them move quickly and and are all well written. Holds interest well.
2,Violent but formless,"These books are about a bodyguard. His job is to take care of people until he can find out exactly who is threatening them. The rest is genre-typical mystery-thriller action, with some Clancyesque notions floating around in the description of weapons and tactics. The real problem I have with this book is that the main characters behave like morons as they contort their lives to do what is convenient for Rucka's overflavored, abundantly dramatic plotlines. There is no way to identify with people who behave as if they are not living their own lives, or lack the wisdom to note they are alive and bear the consequences of their action, especially when the author injects saccharine moralization to make us ""feel"" the ""meaning."" No, thank you."
3,light texture,"It's in gel texture, so it is not greasy. However, I do not see any fine line reduction underneath my eyes. I will not purchase it next time."
1,Absolute piece of garbage - 15 min battery life maximum.,"Unless you have the DC adapter and a very long extension cord, I'd recommend staying away from this camera. You'll be lucky to get more than 15 minutes of use out of this camera when running on battery power, and that's with brand new batteries. There have been too many special moments that I have not been able to capture because the battery in this camera didn't last long enough to snap a single picture. What good is a camera without power? I can't even begin to express my level of frustration with this camera. I can't even sell it to someone else and keep a clear conscience. I'd recommend saving a few extra dollars and buying a Cannon or Nikon, instead of wasting money on a product that you can't rely on."
5,Big LCD - Little Camera - Big Results,"Excellent resolution, giant LCD makes everything easier with this camers.Has a multitude of features and 4 megapixels also."
1,Never received the book.,I was very disappointed that this book was never made available for a avid Cubs fan.
4,Interesting,"I got this book for a class: Anarchy & Chaos Honors Capstone for my undergraduate degree in Biochem since I was focusing on Entropy and the 2nd law of thermodynamics. Certain chapters in this book shed amazingly interesting insight on the topics, and gave me a different point of view. (I especially enjoyed Time's Arrow.)Bottom line: great information. I wouldn't necessarily recommend this book as an introductory text"
4,Learn in your car Spanish Complete Language Course,Wonderful product. Been only working with the program a couple of weeks and I can already have some conversation with a Spanish friend.
4,Lessons for three blocks or three hundred miles,"The lessons on these CDs are set up in a logical sequence. You can drive along, for example, and take in a lesson on ""Transportation Phrases,"" which begins with the easiest phrases and builds on them. At the end of the lesson, you can replay that lesson or move to the next even if you haven't fully mastered the one you just heard. On a long interstate trip, you could pack in a good amount of vocabulary, but you can work on little segments on short jaunts to the market, then practice the words as you're roaming up and down the aisles. There are two speakers, a man and a woman, so you can hear how words sound as spoken by different vocal styles. This is truly an effortless program."
5,Spanish on the run,"This method of learning Spanish is just great!!! My wife and I use it whenever we travel and not only does it help us pick up a foreign language much better, it passes the time on long stretches of highway. Anyone wanting to learn Spanish who travels (Truckdrivers, it's ideal for you) will benefit and the price is unbelievably reasonable."
5,The best language program I have seen so far!,"At first, this program focuses on travel, but as the level of difficulty increases the content diversifies. I have found myself confidently engaging in conversations with native speakers and realizing that they might not have known that I'm not fluent in the language.I am midway through the CDs and strongly feel that I am now beginning to understand conjugations and when to use the various tenses like never before. I do think that I began the course at an intermediate level with a good vocabulary but lacking the correct grammar; this is not for beginners or for people with no previous knowledge of the Spanish language."
4,Easy to learn a new language,This product enable me to learn Spanish while I am driving. I copy the lessons to my mp3 player and now I don't worry about traffic jams anymore. The heavier the traffic the more I learn. The beginning lessons will enable me to travel to a Spanish speaking country and get what I want.
3,GREAT BACK UP,"I was a little disappointed that the bonus disk that come with this set didn't work...especially since it was new. By the time I found this out a considerable time had past and it was to late to return. These lessons are very easy to understand and make a great supplement to my Pimsleur lessons. I wouldn't suggest using this as your sole source for learning Spanish... it can become very mundane, (very slow repeating of every sentence and word). However, for the low price I recommend it as a great second learning tool as I like to use several different things to keep my learning more lively."
3,Not thrilled,"This is a decent Spanish course if you are planning to travel. I wish it started with the basic phrases rather than stuff about trains, tickets, etc. I would love to be able to learn some general phrases first, then how to get on a plane. For the traveler this is probably good. For the person wishing to actually learn the language, I'd look elsewhere."
3,good course,"Note: 1/3 the way throught the course at this writingIt is focused on getting the student up to speed ASAP for a trip to a Spanish speaking destination. I wanted to learn everyday spanish but I still like this course. Having studied Spanish on and off using workbooks etc, this seems to be working for me so far. It helps you start putting sentences together early on; building on a limited set of verbs, adjectives, and nouns early in the course which I think helps you get the ""feel"" and flow of the languge. I am sure I will have to move on to more advanced materials in order to become proficient. Most of all, I like the fact the author is pragmatic. He is not trying to teach you the whole of the language. This is not a long involved academic college course. Short answer- I feel I got a good value"
3,Learn Spanish in your car,"The books and CDs are helpful, but they can't be used simultaneously. (I would assume that most people would use the CDs in the car) This makes the learning a bit difficult, because simply hearing and repeating vocabulary words isn't the most effective way to learn. I wasn't aware it was designed to be a supplement to an actual Spanish course, but had hoped I could use it to learn the language. In fact, it would be more helpful if used in addition to a more thorough method."
4,Nice work,This product is easy to use. Just pop in and repeat. You cant get much simplier than that. I wish it would enuciate a bit better though.
3,Hard to drive and learn,The product may work for some but for me I find it difficult to focus on the lessons while driving. I'm a bit afraid that I will cause an accident. The lessons are more beneficial if you listen at home when you can dedicate some time to them. They move on quickly so I don't really get a lot out off one full lesson. The english seems clear and loud but the Spanish is spoken too soft for me to clearly understand. I also bought a kids CD teaching Spanish for my 3-yr old. We both enjoy that one much better.
3,The information as a whole,"I find that the information contained is done with a great deal of knowledge and forethought. There are however, some issues.1.)The way the information is presented is very stilted and although they show one how it is used they use concepts and words that have not been explained.2)I do find though that it appears to have a great deal of knowledge to impart.3.)One of the CDs is no good because it has screeching noises in it and it loses the programming due to that.Thank You if you actually read this.Hans Boatman"
2,Too Tedious for the Car,"This product is not safe for the car -- it will put you to sleep. In addition, because there is no explanation, just a word or phrase in English and a word in Spanish, there is no way to learn the rules of grammar."
4,My Work is Cut out for me!,I have gone through the first CD and realize that this is not going to be as easy as I thought! I do like the format and the pace. Learning another language is not as simple as just listening to a CD. You really have to practice and plan to listen to the CD's each more than one time.
5,the best course for beginner to advanced student,"i am somewhere between a beginner and an accomplished adult student. this course will challenge and teach you good quality spanish sentences and pronunciation. i have not tired of the repetition and continue to be challenged by the more advanced sentences in later cd's.the time given to respond is short but i like that as it makes you think fast, which is necessary in real life conversation.i love this course."
2,Not what I expected,"From all the rave reviews, I thought this would be a great product but I was really disappointed.Each lesson is just words repeated in English then in Spanish. First a woman says a word in English then a man repeats the word in Spanish. They do cover phrases but it is the same format.There is no examples of conversation and no chance for you to practice conversation.The booklets that come with the program are very small about 3""x5"" and don't really explain all that much."
3,spanish cd's,"You get alot of CD's, but the focus is almost entirely on vacationing and not on functional communication for day to day situations. Good if you will be going on vacation, not good if you need to learn Spanish for work or avocational tasks."
4,Good for travelers,"This book is really geared to people who are going to travel to a Spanish speaking country. It teaches words and phrases to do with travel, like bus, airplane, etc. and also phrases one might use in hotels and restaurants.I only had one difficulty - once I had mastered a section, I wanted to practice the next session several times, but was unable to ""jump"" on the CD - I had to listen to the previous lessons.Other than that, it's easy to use and really is good in the car."
4,Pretty Dam Good,The lessons are well constructed. It takes some dedication but I feel that the cd's are muy bueno.
4,Spanish: The Completre Language Course,"Until now I have heard it only ones, but I think the course will be helpful studying Spanish. It would be even better if the course were spoken in Finnish, but propably there are not such courses?"
1,waaayyyy too much chit chatting......,This is very poorly put together. Much too much chit chatting (in English). No real lessons. Have to listen to too much chatter and the sound has very poor quality...like he was talking into a tape recorder.
1,Do Not Buy,"Not worth the $$ paid. First 3 disc's give a history lesson on language which was of no use. Then after only 2 weeks of play, the disc's no longer play correctly! Do NOT buy this product!"
3,review,some words are hard to understand. so with out someone els its hard to say if you are pronounsing it right.
4,Good for building up your vocabulary.,"It is fairly difficult to learn only by listening, but these CDs will make a long commute to and from work worthwhile. This set should only be an aid to learning Spanish and I would not recommend it as a single source of learning Spanish. You will have to go through each CD a couple of times to memorize the phrases and vocabulary words. The price makes it affordable."
4,Pretty good,"I like learn in your car spanish. I listen to it at work on my personal cd player. I work with mainly spanish speaking people and although most speak English also some only a little, this is making it easier to communicate with them. Of course the ones that speak English also are helping me, If you want to learn spanish this is a good program to start you off.easy to follow, easy to click back and repeat a lesson. You get a DVD with the set so you can hear and see all about mexico, there are 3 levels and on 1st level you get 3 cd's second level 3 + a bonus and same on level 3. These cd's are great value and I recommend them."
4,Great car learning,"I have not finished all the CDs yet, as I am listening to each a few times before moving on. I am so far impressed. At first it seems lacking instructions, but with repitition is great. They are the best CDs I have purchased so far."
4,So far so good,"Its been very helpfull and with as much time as I spend in the car Im able to get through a CD every two days. It goes pretty fast at times, but I just keep skipping back and repeating. I don't know how well I would be doing however if I hadn't had some experience with spanish prior to doing this CD, but for me its been great. Ive already started picking up more and more words and switching over to the spanish stations on the radio to see if I can figure out what they are saying and put some of the words Im learning to use. I think this is a great way to get more familiar with spanish, but I know Im going to require some additional sources prior to really speaking and understanding the language. For the price its a great start!"
5,excellent learning tool,"I am surprised at how easy it has been for me. This is so much easier than the old textbook, classroom combo. I had a little bit of trouble telling b's from v's until my daughter told me they are opposite of the way Americans pronounce it."
3,Decent but Behind the Wheel Spanish is Better,"First, the good part about Spanish Complete.Clear recording, typical 'listen and repeat' Spanish course.That's it for the good.Now, for the best ...I agree with the Spanish teacher's review found at Behind the Wheel Spanish. Behind the Wheel Spanish is way better than bothSpanish Complete and Pimsleur.The reasons he gives and I echo are the sentence building, the native speaker's voice, the incredible amount of vocabulary you learn, the clarity. the learning pace all found in Behind the Wheel Spanish that are not found in Spanish Complete and definitely not in Pimsleur."
2,Disappointed,"I read all the positive reviews concerning this product and was very hopeful that I could learn quite a bit of Spanish by listening to the CD's. However, I have found that the material is presented in a manner which doesn't facilitate recalling what you have heard. There is an English speaker saying a word or phrase in English, than a pause, and then a Spanish speaker repeats the word or phrase in Spanish. From that point, you move on to the next phrase, etc. What I find lacking in the program is any ""situational"" role plays where you are placed in a scenario as Spanish speaker and given the opportunity to ""interact"" as you would if you were in a situation to really use Spanish. This type of role play would help to recall what Spanish you have been introduced to in the program, and subsequently recalling the Spanish when you really need to use it. Basically, this program is just hearing and repeating an unbelievable amount of words and phrases."
2,A month passed and I am still puzzeled,"I hear the audio every day in my car but have not got the basics yet.The audio says a sentence in english and then twice in spanish.The sentences are loosly connected, not a dialog but the same senetce with him, her, it etc.No grammmer explantion at all so I have to guess when you say I want in one word and when to say I sepratly.I am continuing listening in my car and hope until I reach the 120 lesson I shall feel better about the effectiness of this audio. Currently I am in lesson 70."
3,for the traveler,"The coarse was very clear and well organized etc. The problem I had with it is it concentrated on words I never use. example- consolate, pastry shop, railroad station. I wanted to learn how to talk to someone in Spanish. Everywhere I have traveled in Mexico all the airports etc all speak English so I don't need all the travel words, I wanted to have a conversation. Most of this coarse is dedicated to travel."
1,Dangerous while driving,"I don't think this course is bad per se, maybe a little boring because of all the vocabulary, which of course is necessary and useful. However, the big issue with this course is in the title, ""learn in your car"" which nobody should actually do because it is at least as distracting, maybe even more, as cell phones are, you have to listen, think, respond - and this in a foreign language. This is why, imho, this course should be banned from listening while driving, and the title needs to be changed so it would not encourage people to do so."
3,Never used it,"I didn't like the narrator, so i never really got into using this product. Maybe someday I will find a more pleasing product"
4,Great Product - wished I started sooner,"I am now on disk 2 and so far I have been able to keep up with the listen-and-repeat format of this language course. I knew a smattering of Spanish, but this product has made the language make more sense. Plus, I feel tat my hour-long commute is being put to better use. Can't wait to start conjugating!"
2,Spanish Siesta Lesson,I guess you can learn Spanish from this set of CDs if you can stay awake long enough to hang with it. One of the most boring lesson formats I have ever tried to use. I never got through the entire set. I don't have the patience for this format.
2,Not too useful,As others have stated there is no conversation practice so you are not going to become conversant. All you are doing is parroting single words and phrases. You have to practice conversation to hear words in context. They will often sound different that way than hearing them as single units. So this set is not going to do much for your comprehension. It might be helpful for pronounciation practice but little more. Those of you who are complaining that you can not use it while driving or working are going to have realize that you can not become very proficient in a language practicing it while doing other things. It takes hard work and time devoted to mastering it with both books and audio without being distracted by anything else. Sorry but that is the way it is.
3,Learn in Your Car,"Between the initial lessons covered so far (Level 1) and Level 2 lessons (tape 2) there are several editorial errors. In some cases the response made in the CD has no connection with the initial phrase or it is in the wrong person or verb form.Such errors would be particularly confusing if one were driving in a car and counting on a correct response without reference to the accompanying booklet. When using the booklet concurrently, the confusion is minimal.There are also errors in the booklet, where that response has no connection with the initial phrase.Also, in the many cases where the anticipated response is fairly long on the part of the listener, not enough time is given for the listener to frame his/her reply either out loud or in his/her head. One or two additional seconds would help."
3,"affordable, mediocre","I wanted to improve my spanish with this, and I think it did help somewhat. I ripped all the files to my personal music player and listened to them on the commute to work for a few months. These are dull and uncreative lessons - just repetition of words. I must admit that I was sometimes tired on the 6:20 train but still I was disappointed at how often I would space out or fall asleep while listening to these.They were so inexpensive that I think I got my money's worth, but now I found out my local library has the superior pimsleur course on many languages, and there are many free online resources, and I will use those for future language learning."
3,Will get you by!,It covers most of what you would need in trying to converse in Spanish. Would probably be better if you were working with someone else on the project. Having had three years of French in college has helped me in hearing the Spanish sounds. Would take a lot of self discipline to learn Spanish in this manner.
2,NOT Recommended for Quick Conversational Learning,"With an upcoming trip to Spain, and no knowledge whatsoever of Spanish, I ordered this set hoping to learn enough Spanish to get by.The first sixty or so lessons were isolated repetitions of lists of words with no contextual phrasing or conversation whatsoever. My knowledge of French and Italian helped with those Spanish words that have similarities in those other languages, but otherwise, by the time I got to subsequent lessons, it was almost impossible for me to recall the bulk of the Spanish words dictated in the earlier lessons.My wife, who took Spanish in school, found the lessons to be good refreshers, but also agreed that they did not serve well as a pre-vacation immersion course.Anyone wishing to quickly learn conversational Spanish should ignore the glowing reviews below and consider obtaining a course that uses the immersion method (i.e. where you listen to everything IN CONTEXT rather than in isolated dictate-pause-dictate list fashion)."
2,Where's the translation?,"The lessons get you repeating Spanish words and phrases but do not provide a translation to English. The booklet must be used to translate. I was expecting to learn while driving. I am unable to read the booklet while driving so this system did not benefit me. Except for perfecting pronunciation, I don't see much use for this in the car."
2,Better tapes are available,"This course is good for practicing pronunciation, but not good for learning to put words together into sentences. Each of the early lessons consists of English words that are repeated twice in Spanish but not revisited until many lessons later. There isn't enough repetition to build a strong vocabulary."
2,Caring For His Babies,"Keelan's half-sister died in childbirth leaving twin premature babies so he hired a nurse, Jessica Russell.This is my third Medical Romance and due to that reason I don't have a lot to compare with. I'm giving it 2.5 stars because Jessica keeps having flashback about sleeping with a lot of men and even one of her patient's husbands while she was living in their home (home nurse). This is just not romance. You don't sleep with a patient's husband no matter what. PERIOD!!!!!!!"
2,nice autobiography.... but little useful info,"this guy writes a nice autobiography about how he did it in marketing... maybe interesting for some but not for me. I guess I was expecting something more than a horn blowing fanfare of an ""I did it my way"" brag-o-rama."
5,Oris review,"This is a super looking watch, and am looking forward owning one. Very very sharp and well built.."
1,ONLY WORKS OUTSIDE,"The flash is to bright, even if you turn the exposure level down all the way, the pictures come out all white. I would have to turn out all the lights to take a picture indoors, then you can't see what you're taking a picture of. If you turn on all the lights and turn the exposure level all the way up, you then get dim pictures with poor resolution.Also there is no viewfinder besides the LCD screen, so its hard to aim.It takes good pictures outdoors in the daytime."
5,What do you know! It works!,"I ordered this rather skeptically, based on awful experience with the first epilators years ago, but now I'm over 50 I find I'm growing a fine white halo on my face. Yuk. The epilator came today and I tried it right away, ignoring the advice to wait till evening in case my face got red. It smarted, but less so than waxing, and even less as I went back to get hairs it missed the first time. I put cortisone cream on after finishing, and face cream later. I could't tell the difference from before I used it, and still can't several hours later; maybe a little pink, but not red, puffy and sore as after waxing. Don't know if the cortisone cream had anything to do with that or not. In some reviews users complained about missed hairs, but going back over the area took care of them for me. I was surprised, too, that it got such fine hairs. It's already paid for itself, too! Bye-bye, beauty salon!"
5,A DREAM compared to the epilators of the '80s,"My sister-in-law convinced me to try this, even though I had a HORRIBLE experience with an epilator in the 80s. The old one hurt so bad I felt like I needed a quart of whiskey just to work up the nerve to do it, and I (needless to say) gave up on it after just one or two painful trials. This one, however, is much improved. It doesn't feel like a massage, but it's not painful at all. I'm still not ready to do the old underarms, as my sister-in-law does, but overall I'd have to give it a big thumbs up!"
4,good stuff,"I was pleased with the results of this Braun product. I used it a little over 2 weeks ago and haven't had to shave yet. Granted, my legs are not as silky smooth as they are right after shaving, but the time that is saved is well worth the smoothness to me. I haven't had any ingrown hair problems as some people do. It does hurt, but the pain is bearable. There will be little red dots on your legs or wherever you use it where the hair was pulled out, but they are temporary, lasting less than 24 hours."
3,There likely is better,"You must be extremly patient to use this device. It will pull most hairs, but notice i say most. Also if you have think hair then you subject to breaking hair rather than pulling all of them out.Also the shaver attachment is mearly average, and hardly what I whould call a good close shave.It is not as well built as I imagined, I worry about stripping the plastic driving gear over time. And the beginner attachment is absolutly worthless.If you do want it better at a reduced, 'sale price'"
1,Braun's Boo Boo,I regret to review this item because it was a big disappointment to me. Some of Braun's other products are better. I'd thought this might be useful as a complete hair remover for all parts of the body but it doesn't even fulfill its basic function. It not only did not remove the hair on my legs; it was very painful to use. I've been trying to recall how to return it as it is of no use to me. An ordinary electric shaver seems to work better.
1,Painful!,"The first time that I used this was on my arm pits and it hurt so bad, I couldn't even get one done. It felt like razor blades were slashing my skin. I will be returning this as soon as possible. I'd rather shave with a razor every day than be in so much pain."
4,braun silk-epil,"I love this product! I love not having to shave everyday. I would probably give this product 5 stars if it were a cordless item. ...but for the price I'm very pleased. At first use there may be some discomfort( mainly in the bikini area and underarms)but you really do get used to it. when using this on my legs, I have had no pain or redness."
5,"I am finally free, free, freeeeee from waxing!!!!!!","I despise razors because it's an every day affair and waxing was my only alternative. I normally spend $80 a month and wait weeks waiting for hair long enough to be waxed (not a pretty sight in summer) and for an appointment. I love this gamble I took, after all it's less than 1 waxing session! I love it! I notice no pain while getting legs and bikini waxed but cry like a baby during my brows. Much less painful than the Original EpiLady, who ruined me forever for epi systems. I only noticed pain in the bikini area but then I tried to focus instead on how much I was saving by using this! : )"
4,better than anything but professional wax,"Like some of the others who have rated it, I have bikini hair that falls outside the bikini area. If you are in this situation, you know there is no perfect solution-- everything leaves either razor bumps or ingrown hairs. The Braun 2370 does better than anything else (and I've tried everything) except a good professional wax-- and is paid for if you can avoid 2 professional waxes. If you have waxed in the past, this will not hurt much, though I always use it on the slower setting for control. It works fine on legs, but I think it is easier to shave legs. Make sure you exfoliate regularly to minimize the ingrown hairs. The trimmer is also great for the parts you don't epilate!"
3,Yes it hurts!!!,I received mine yesterday and it took hours to finish one lower leg because of the breaks I had to keep taking. It HURTS BAD. There is no other way to say it. It works but I just don't know if I can keep it. I managed to get half of the other lower leg before I was almost in tears. I just shaved the rest. Honestly I don't know if I will keep it because it is very painful but shaving is also a nightmare for me as well. I do have very sensitive skin so if you don't then maybe this product will be easier on your legs than on mine.
3,Ok,This white chocolate was a little different than I had been using. It was ok. Great service and I would order again.
5,Delicious,These chips are the real thing and are delicious. Daughter has them all set for use in baking. Shipment arrived way ahead of the scheduled date.
1,Waste of money,"If you don't know what this shows, I feel sorry for your wife! Don't waste your money; there are better things available."
1,"Does NOT reflect the castle layout, POOR QUALITY!","This map is confusingly folded, and mostly just lays out the numerous bathrooms of the castle. I am not kidding! There are three different bathrooms labeled (boys/girls/prefects), however, only ONE classroom (defense against the dark arts). Geez, if I need to pee I am in luck!Also, the many ridiculous folds allow for NO CONTINUITY at all within the map, and there is much more made up ""magical"" language than real english written on the map to understand anything written on it. My 9 year old avid Harry Potter fan, as well as myself, are very dissappointed. Save your money and draw one yourself."
4,A Useful Book,"This is a pretty good book for people concerned about possible deterioration of American civil liberties in the event of further successful 9/11-type attacks. It is almost impossible to amend the U.S. Constitution. So Ackerman proposes laws that could be enacted by Congress and states that would help do this. It should be read in conjunction with Richard Posner's Catastrophe, which makes a case for some curtailment of civil liberties, given the dangers of the age we live in."
1,A Yale professor impressed with himself,"This book spews the progressive line that judges should make laws and run the country. By proposing that war powers be taken over by a group of congress and ruled over by judges, he proposes that we all give up our right to vote and express ourselves to an unelected and unfireable federal judge. More of the same ""we know better than you"" pablum spewed by the socialist/communist/nambla movement. What is even sadder is that he is a professor of law and influences young minds in this capacity. Save your money. Why pay to read ""I am smart and you are not"". If so bright why has he never been able to get a real job in the private sector without the cushion of tenure. Buy a latte instead, more satisfying."
4,"Excellent size, easy to use... not the best quality","This camera has an incredible size and is very easy to use. Having the quick usb docking station with rechargable battery is definitely a plus. The color on the photographs is slightly washed out, in my opinion, and leans a bit too far toward the blue/grey color scheme. However, this cannot outway it's portability, slick look, and otherwise positive features. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a very compact, attractive digital camera."
