2,Great results but doesn't hold up,"This was a gift and Its decorated my bar for occasional blended drinks. The operation is loud but its swift and powerful. The spigot is a nice feature, for those that reported it clogging, heres a tip: It's not obvious but the blade should be running to create pressure during a pour. Drink consistency is excellent and it will quickly liquify anything that goes in a drink. Cleanup is good... for a quick cleanup just add soap and hot water. For more thorough, the pitcher comes apart. Now for the bad news, this product has a critical design flaw: the plastic paddles beneath the pitcher inevitably deteriorate and after being stripped by the motor, the blender is useless. Parts are not commonly available."
2,Generally dissatisfied with this product,"The blender is very loud, and often has to be 'helped' with the plastic stirrer. It does well with frozen fruit, but is terrible with ice. The spigot only works if you have a very runny smoothie--I like mine a little thicker, and was never able to get more than a few tablespoons out of the spigot as a result. Also, the spigot is extremely hard to clean thoroughly. But pouring the smoothie out of the pitcher is also difficult, as there is no pour spout. The pitcher comes apart easily for cleaning, but even if you tighten the blades all the way onto the pitcher, some of the smoothie still leaks into the base. Lastly, when I began to use the smoothie maker daily, it died after a few months. Just started smoking and tearing apart the rubber under the blades. I'd recommend just getting a regular blender to make smoothies."
2,Smoothie No More - What a waste of good tequila!!,"I had this machine for about 3 years with no issues. But, how often do most people use their machine? I used it maybe 15 to 20 times. I went to use it yesterday and all of a sudden I see smoke and the bottom of the machine and that funny electric smell (We all know what that smell means) The plastic bottom of the base stuck to the machine and margarita's were everywhere (except in my glass). We had to throw the whole machine out. Now I will be buying a new machine, being that I enjoyed the convenience of the spout but if I can't find one thats non plastic I will use my blender. The smoothie maker makes less of a mess for drinks, a blender always doesnt pour as nice. I will not buy another plastic model again. (I believe this one was a gift to me) Do yourselfs a favor and spend the extra cash on a metal version or even glass if this exists, obviously the motor doesn't last long and the plastic parts break to fast according to other reviews I've read."
2,Poor Design,"Nice list of features, but poorly implemented. If the jar is more than half full, juice shoots out between the lid and the jar at the front. The lid does not make an air tight seal. Very messy. The spout is a nice feature but I got tired of the mess. The unit wobbles around a lot when blending as well - needs constant watching.Returned unit to Costco ($39) after 1st use."
1,Makes great smoothies as long as it works,This machine makes great smoothies WHEN it works. I'm on my third machine. The first two completely quit working after making 4 or 5 smoothies. If this one dies then I'm giving up.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK!,I was moving into my new apartment and my fiance and I love smoothies. We thought this was perfect. I had to have it. We used it for about a month and the gears were stripped. It caused this burned rubber smell. The spout thing was a great idea but sometimes it gets clogged up or something and I have to pour it out the regular way anyway. I do not recommend this product. You will be disappointed.
1,Smoothie Parts,"We received the Smoothie Pro 600 as a gift and were very happy with it, but only for a brief period. After only a half dozen uses, the handle on the spout broke off. The design of the spout is very poor. It operates by a spring activated mechanism with a lever that you have to push to open the spout. The lever is attached by the flimsiest pair of plastic pins and the torque needed to open the spout is simply too great for these to last. Once broken the handle falls off and cannot be reattached. I have been unable to find a replacement part making the instrument essentially useless. A parts list would have solved this problem."
2,"When works, it's great, dies quick","This was an awesome smoothie maker until the motor burned out after 6 months. Works excellent for FRESH fruits, but we like to freeze bananas and strawberries to use. It worked like a charm and we did use it at least 4 times per week, but still expected it to go longer than a few months. I would highly recommend this if you use mostly fresh fruits and vegetables, but for frozen drinks with frozen fruit or ice, a commercial machine with a heavy duty motor is better. This is a good way to start and see if you make smoothies a habit, and you can always upgrade later."
1,Plastic parts don't hold up,After less than 10 uses the spout handle broke off. I think the plastic used in this product is simply not sturdy enough.
2,i hate this blender,this blender is ok the first time you use it i guess..after that the spout gets clogged and makes it a big mess every time you use it and harder to clean it also doesnt crush ice that well..im on my way to target to get a new one now...
1,Terrible,"It's very loud and does not crush ice as well as my normal cheap blender. I think it's designed more for non-frozen fruit. The spout is cool, but doesn't work very well unless your smoothy is extremely thin. Oh, and it has to be running while you use the spout. That's difficult because with one hand on your glass and the other on the spout, you have no hands left to hold the container which feels like it could fly off at any second because the thing rattles so hard."
2,Don't get too attached,"We received the Smoother Maker as a Christmas gift. Like so many other reviews, it worked great for the about the first month. Nothing broke, but after a while the blade base would become unscrewed during the smoothing/mixing process resulting in a complete smoothy mess especially when you lifted the container for further cleaning. At first it was intermittent, then it occurred everytime. It blends wonderfully; however, this company needs to go back to the design drawing board."
2,So-So Smoothie,"If you enjoy licking your smoothie off the counter and floor, this is the machine for you! This product has leaked on me more than once, and has ruined at least two kitchen floor mats. It also does not crush ice effectively unless you leave it running for at least 30 seconds. And even then, I've still had big chunks of ice that prevent the smoothie mixture from coming out of the spout."
3,Not easy to clean.,"As a smoothie maven this blender is both a wonder and a pain. For the most part, the power is excellent as well as the blade and jar design. It chops ices without a bit of hesitation, and rips through heavier fruits and frozen products like a dream.However, the jar has two main problems. One, it lends itself to air bubbles. While fruit and products do flow well to the blade, an air bubble will stop this thing in its tracks if you want a thicker smoothie. The second major product is cleaning. The biggest thing is that in order to clean this thing out, you HAVE to take off the spout and take it apart. The first time I tried simply rinsing it out, but was disgusted when I convinced myself to take it apart.If you're looking for a blender that will shred heavier stuff, and don't plan on using it all that much, this is for you. Just get ready to do some hefty cleaning when it's all said and done."
2,Breaks down Quickly,"We purchased this in January of 2003. We used it occasionally in the home. Main usage was making choc shakes, etc. The product was great while it lasted. It chops ice exeptional well, but there are design flaws that make the blender a short term wonder. I would guess that many people are experiencing the short life span of these machines, and are dismayed with the absolute lack of quality in design durability. These types of flaws should never have happened, but the manuafacturer must not be concerned about their reputation. I attempted to find replacement parts, and couldnt even locate the manufacturers name on the internet. Made in China, are the key words. This manufacturer is revenue driven and a short term player in the market. Caveat emptor! let the buyer beware Smart consumers know their rights and act on them. *** Information is the best defense against purchasing ***"
1,not worth the money,"My husband and I got this for our wedding. We were excited because we love smoothies. But the first time we made a smoothie, we realized that it was too thick to come out of the cool spout which is one of the features that made us register for this over a normal blender. Then after about 25 uses, the part between the base and the pitcher burned up. I had a cheap blender that lasted longer. Don't waste your money."
2,what a waste,"My daughter got this for a Christmas present and we used it alomost everyday for a month and a half, and would have kept using it until the darn spout broke off. What a piece of junk. So of COURSE i went looking for replacement parts and of COURSE you cant FIND the manufacturer anywhere. All I found was a list of complaints longer than my arm. It worked just long enough for me to throw away the reciept and box. I should have stuck with my good old reliable Kitchen Aide blender."
2,troublesome machine,"I bought an Ultimate Smoothie Machine a month or so ago, and have had one major problem with it. Fill it with smoothie ingredients, add a few cups of ice, and push the button. If you stick to the low speed, everything is OK. If you push the high speed button to really make it nice and smooth, the base of the blender jar unscrews itself, dumping smoothie mix all over the blender base and making a horrible mess! I've had this happen to me many times, so this one goes back to the store for a refund!"
1,"good, but horribly noisy!","I was really excited to get the Smoothie Maker. We spend too much money on Baskin-Robbins smoothies, so for $39.99 it was a real bargain. We got it home, broke out fruit, ice cream, etc. and started it up.Well, it sounded like an airport in the kitchen for a bit. Everyone was putting their hands to their ears and making grimmacing faces. It was quite unpleasant. The machine was trying to walk off the countertop. By the time all was done, the smoothies tasted good, but everyone was so busy making fun of the machine and rubbing their ears, that I was a little disturbed with it.I tried it again last night, because my 4 year old nephew was here. We thought it would be fun to make smoothies. He screamed when I started it up. It was so loud he ran in the other room. We had to coax him out and let him know that it was not going to blow up.My husband has power tools less annoying than this smoothie maker. It's going back today."
1,A piece of junk,"I received this as a gift and was so excited because I thought it would be great. Wrong! It clogged from the beginning if it was even half full. After a couple of weeks, the blades would not spin because the cheap plastic mechanism was worn down and the machine became useless. The few times it worked correctly it was extremely noisy and ""jumped"" all over the counter. The pour spout leaked. In short, this was one of the worst appliances I have ever owned. It is cheaply made. My attempts to contact the company were ignored. I finally gave up and threw it out. Buy a blender instead. This thing is a total waste of money."
1,"Interesting concept, poor engineering","The idea of having a blender capable of crushing ice to make great smoothies is apparently appealing to many people. However, the best thing about this machine is the stick that it comes with to move the ice and other contents around to aid in the blending. That is about it. The spout for pouring the contents, while theoretically sounds good, is painful to clean. I would rather have a lip in the container and a handle on a side to make it easy to pour the contents out. And like what soooooo many other people said, this thing breaks easily. The cogs in the blade component strip and the thing just starts to leak everywhere."
1,Broken Motor,"I received the smoothie maker as a wedding present and couldn't wait to start using it. I used it a total of 8 times and when the motor stopped working. Since the machine won't dispence without it being on the ""pour"" setting I had to spoon out my smoothie. What a pain in the butt. Don't waste your money on this piece of crap!!"
1,Great smoothies but it leaks,"I agree with the reviews that gave this machine 5 stars because it really does make great smoothies. However, I gave it one star because it leaks. The leaking has just gotten worse the more I use it. I too have had problems with the bottom coming off (what a mess!). It is poorly designed. Unfortunately, it was a gift and I couldn't return it. It is headed for the trash soon."
1,Don't waste your money,"I was excited when I received this as a gift. We like smoothies and I thought this would be ideal. Wrong! After two months of light use, the machine refused to blend anything. The motor would run but the blades would not turn. I think the plastic teeth on the bottom of the jar wore down. This smoothie maker is very loud and did not blend well if more than half the jar was filled. Also, the pour spout clogged easily and leaked. The plastic container did not come apart for cleaning and I always felt like it was dirty, since I could not take it completely apart for cleaning as I do my blender. I tried to contact the manufactuer to get replacement parts but got no response. I finally junked it and went back to my old reliable blender. I think this smoothie maker is a piece of junk. Don't waste your money. A good blender does a much better job."
3,Love the concept but the hardware needs some work,I have loved my smoothie Elite for over a year. I have used it over and over again regardless of its issues. Several things I don't like about are: You have to turn the power on (pulse)if you want the spout to pour. The rubber teeth on the bottom are not rugged enough and have been stripped or broken off rendering my smoothie maker useless. I looked on line to see if I could buy spare parts but can't find any.
3,Was great while it worked.....which was about 10 months,"I got this as a Christmas gift last year (2002). It is now October of 2003, and it is broken. First the dispenser tip broke, then finally the motor broke - or whatever it is that has made it stop spinning. It is very loud, and vibrates a lot. While it worked - I loved it. It crushed ice better than any machine I had ever used. I loved making great tasting and healthy smoothies for me and my kids. If I had spent my own money on this product, I'd be upset that it didn't last very long."
1,Buy only if you want it to last less than a year...,"I used this smoothie maker often for a little under a year. Recently, the rubber got so hot when in use that it melted and the pitcher is now fused to the unit. I have to throw it out and have cereal for breakfast until I find a better product."

2,Looks can be decieving,"I bought this steering wheel cover because I thought I would look great in my car. As I'm trying to put it on my steering wheel, it was nearly impossible to get that thing on and while in the process, the inner rubber piece ripped. I was able to get it on my car with the ripped rubber piece. I have to try to even it out in one spot due to the ripped area overlapping itself."
2,Offensive Smell,"It's nice looking and seems well made, but even after having it on the steering wheel for 4 weeks now, it still gives off an odd unpleasant smell. I was hoping that it would only be at first and then fade, but It's like a chemical smell and irritates my nose and is a bit nauseating still."
3,Looks great but smells VERY STRONGLY of chemicals.,"It looks and feels great but as soon as I took it out of its plastic wrapping I was almost overwhelmed by the chemical smell. I laughed it off and set it on the kitchen counter. My wife wasn't having that so I moved it out to the garage to air out.After three hours I went out to the garage and I'll tell you what, the GARAGE smelled of the darn thing! It's sitting out in my backyard right now. If it still smells as strong tomorrow there is no way I'm putting it in my car. It'll go straight back for a refund. I'm crossing my fingers that I won't have to do that because it really does look sweet.I'll update tomorrow :)**UPDATE**I gave it a week of sitting outside in the sun and it STILL smelled strongly of chemicals. It won't be going in my car (sadly.) *ALSO, LIKE THE REVIEWER ABOVE ME, IT DID NOT FIT MY STEERING WHEEL WHEN I TRIED TO PUT IT ON AND I HAVE A TINY CAR!!!"
1,Disappointed - not up with the times,I have just finished reading this book and was quite disappointed. The book is not sufficiently up-to-date and is fairly IBM-oriented. It does explain what best practices are about but does not offer sufficient help for you to actually apply them usefully. It is very general/high level. It also overstates their usefulness and doesn't sufficiently discuss the dangers of using them - they can be a follow the leader tool.
1,Banana Boat Ultramist items recalled,"There have been reports of four people catching on fire from the Banana Boat Ultramist products. Based on this I would say, do not buy this. You can research this on the internet but unfortunately I can't post a link here for it.This particular Ultramist product was not recalled. I wouldn't use this however to be on the safe side."
3,Nice Sign,Only complaint I have is that each sign has a sticky label attached to it with product number and this label is impossible to remove without leaving sticky residue which collects dirt and looks bad
1,Atomic Clock Doesn't Work!,"I followed all the directions and allowed 72 hours for the clock to reset itself. Since the best reception to Colorado is between 12am to 3am, and the clock specifically targets that time frame for auto updates, I set the time manually (minus 7 minutes to make sure that it actually DID pick up the signal). The clock never set itself correctly. I refuse to ""position"" my clock to face Colorado (although it was facing in the general direction), and my side of the bed is not closest to the window (and I think it is ridiculous to think I have to strategically arrange my clock in order to get it to work). Also, the clock is very light weight and easily moves around. The buttons are extremely small and I had to pick up the clock to set the alarm (since it slid accross the night stand when I tried pushing the alarm button), and it was still difficult to get the buttons to work even after that. Cheap construction!"
3,Awesome light but horrid battery life,"I got this as a suprise for my girl friend and she absolutely loved it. It has lots of different settings, a remote control, and automatically turns itself off. With all this said even though it turns itself off I've been lucky for the batteries to last more than a week. It seems like I've spent more in batteries than what i did for this actual product. All in all a good buy so long as you don't mind replacing batteries frequently. I would suggest getting a set of rechargables. Ultimate thing this item is lacking is a power cord."
3,Just Okay,I got this for son for Christmas. He doesn't seem to interested in it. It works well. That's all I can say about it.
2,Looks cool...,"Looks cool in the room but my daughter did not like it that much for some reason... also it doesn't have some of the functionality I thought it had, like turning on automatically when it's dark? I am sure I read that somewhere..."
5,Such a great toy,We set this up in my 4 year old's room and the whole family loves it. Two thumbs way way up!
5,Moon In my Room,Love this - and so did the person i gave it to as a gift. I did see it this season in Wall Mart after I had ordered it.
5,Excellent,This moon is wonderful. My kids love it. Its on the wall and they turn it on and learn about the phases of the moon. Excellent educative product.
4,Great Moon!,We love this moon. It will be hanging on the wall in my son's space room. We set the moon phase at night just like the real one. It looks great and everyone that has seen it really enjoys it.
3,It really is a moon in your child's room,"My son has always had a fascination with the moon - always pointing it out at night and those times when you can just see a ghost of it in the daytime. Crescent moon or full moon - he loves it.This is not a toy really - more a nightlight or decoration. He loves it and it is quite realistic, if not as bright as it is shown in the pic. He's mesmerized by it each night and always falls asleep before it shuts off. Very good purchase for us.It was about $20 when I bought it just before Christmas. It's gone up as I write this. But still worth it if your child is as fascinated by the moon as mine is."
2,poor customer service,"Bought this for my son's b-day and it worked great for 4 months. When the lights stopped working and I had replaced batteries in both the moon and the remote twice I called Fat Brain Toys, through whom I purchased it, and then Uncle Milton. Niether company was responsive nor gave any help. Only if it was within 90 days of purchase, so they say. So if you want a toy that works for 4 months and then leaves your child disappointed - this is it!"
2,Decent product but not great,"Don't buy this unless you plan on attaching the remote to your forehead with duct-tape; if you lose the remote you cannot operate the moon. The moon also has an automatic time that it comes on; it's supposed to be when it gets dark, but it comes on way too early to be any good, because nobody is in their room that early, and it only stays on for 30 minutes. When it comes on by itself, (because its too early) you can barely notice it is on."
3,I Love it......however....,I love this product however......it seems to burn up batteries like crazyall of the sudden. The price is a little high too! I'm sure this product could be sold cheaper. That being said....we really love it. My little girl plays with it alot. I just wish the batteries didn't burn up so quickly. It seems really bad lately and she's playing with it less so it doesn't make any sense.
4,Hack Opportunity,"I got one of these for my cousin's space-themed room, and he loves it. But as other reviewers have noted, it eats batteries like crazy. So I hardwired a low-voltage AC adapter I liberated from a broken telephone answering machine into the battery terminals, and everybody's happy."
5,A stellar children's toy,This toy is so basic and yet so original. Every classroom in the world should have for its curiosity as well as calming effect.
4,Wonderful!,"The product is wonderful. It sets a lovely glow in the room and is easy to install. My only complaint is that the light is on a timer, so it shuts off automatically after 20 or 30 minutes and there is no option to shut the timer off."
3,No CD in box,"Received this toy and tried it right away. My kids said it was ""boring"". It did not come with the ""enclosed 15-minute CD"" that is referenced in the product description."
3,Not That Thrilled,"Nowhere in the product description (including going back and rereading now) did I see that this product requires 4 AA batteries in addition to the 2 AAA batteries that are stated. I didn't expect to have to use more than the 2AAA. Okay, fine.The battery compartments should be made to easily pop out like every other product on the market - NOT have to be unscrewed. Makes no sense to me and is a pain already.The moon is okay, but not as exciting as I thought it would be. Maybe it'll grow on me as I use it in the dark.Stock up on batteries for this toy. Now I wonder what the Rainbow in My Room will require besides the three AAA batteries listed in the description. Hope that item isn't as underwhelming as this one."
4,Kids love it!,I really think this is a neat product. The kids loved it too. We like how it goes through all the phases. I think it's way too bright to be a night ligt. Plus it sucks down batteries fast. My son is 3 and likes it and I think even older kids would like it.
5,Great!,This moon is a lot of fun for kids to look at while falling asleep. Batteries have lasted over a month. Very happy with this purchase.
5,Very Cool!,"This moon is really cool. I did my boys' room in an outer space theme and this fit right in. The different settings are really neat, and my boys love that they can change the phases of the moon. It makes a great night light too. Definately recomend this!"
3,"Great gift, but power adapter would be great",I got this for my 3 year old kid. After reading so many reviews regarding battery life I adapted voltage converter to avoid the hassle. It should be offered as an option.
4,My 10-year old niece LOVED the Moon,I purchased this product as a birthday gift for my 10-year old niece. It was easy to hang - easy to operate - and she really likes it!
4,moon in my room,"My son was so excited to have the moon and stars (purchased seperately and basically stuck to his ceiling) in his room. It has an auto shut off as well. Kind of cheesy, but fun for the kid wanting a planet room!"
5,Lights up the night and their faces!,"My daughters begged and begged for this toy and Santa gave in last year. We moved and this was the first thing to go up in their room and it's been their favorite thing ever since! It is simple, easy to use and surprisingly bright for it's size. I have bought this as a gift for 3 babies to be's nursery's since since it is bright enough to check on baby by and turns itself off."
5,Fun and just what the kids wanted,"I ordered this for my three year old son's room and it looks great. Yes, it's cheap plastic, but when it's on the wall it doesn't look that way. It lights up very nicely and even shuts off automatically after 30 minutes. I put it up high and placed the remote in his closet so he can't play with it (or lose it!). We turn it on each night, but since the full moon phase is pretty bright I put it on one of the quarter moon phases and it's perfect. Meanwhile my 6 year old daughter is begging for one in her room. Looks like I will be ordering another one!"
1,Died within a month,"We were initially so thrilled with the purchase. My daughter asked for the moon for Christmas and we were able to get it for her! So sweet. But after a month, the moon would no longer turn on. After taking it down from the wall, replacing the batteries, replacing the batteries in the remote, still won't work. Not cool! I feel like $25 toys should last longer than a month. Now its nothing but trash. What a waste!"
1,Skip This One,"My 5 year old son got this toy as a gift as he loves space and science. Unfortunately, after hanging the moon, it only worked a short time and then died never to be revived again no matter how many batteries we changed. Also, when the moon did work, the light in the moon itself was BARELY visable. We had a hard time telling the shape/state of the moon even in a completely dark room. I would skip this one. Waste of money."
1,Broke after half a day...,"I purchased this because my 2 year old loves to look at the moon. I unpacked it and it worked literally for 5 minutes, it went out and never worked again. Changed the batteries, nothing.I got a replacement. The second one worked for a full day (Yay!) then stopped working. Again, changed batteries and NOTHING!So I decided to open up BOTH of them. In the first one, the wires were loose and one light burned out. On the second one, all the wires were attached but it was dead as a doornail.I thought maybe I just got a dud with the first one. Nope!Useless, worthless and a complete waste of money."
3,Very nice idea but eats batteries way too fast...,Get some rechargable batteries for this because you'll need them when you realise it eats through 4 (Duracell) AAs every two/three weeks.A disappointment considering the innovative design of this great educational night light.Still recommended though.
1,Faulty Battery Casing,"My brother, the uncle of my two sons, purchased this item for Christams. In the excitement of testing this item out they realized the battery backing was not able to be opened. The screw casing was stripped! No big deal, I thought, I would just call the company. They are not willing to replace the prodect unless I pay for shipping. They recomeded that I take it to a local store to replace knowing that it was purchased over 1000 miles away and not at a chain store! Passing the buck. I then asked to speak to a super visor and she repeated the same mantra, ""sorry company policey."" I never go to the lengths that I am now, but I am tired of companies not performing the basic duties of customer satisfaction. They want me to go to the post office and mail it to them at which time they will determine whose fault it is and then mail me a new one. When I asked if there was any way around said policy the manager told me I could write a letter. So here it is."
1,Remote doesn't work wich is HUGE inconvenience!,"We purchased this for my 6 year old for Christmas. We were very excited to get it and she was anticipating getting to see it work in her room at night. However, we have never been able to get the remote to work. Since this hangs on the wall, preferably pretty high up it is a huge inconvenience to turn it on/off. Hopefully we can get it straightened out, but very frustrating for something new and fresh out of the box."
1,Product Doesn't Work,"We purchased Moon in My Room. The Moon does not light up properly and, consequently, the remote control does not work. When we called Uncle Milton, we were informed that we would have to pay for shipping back to the company without receiving a refund for it. This is ""policy."" Our experiences with other children toy manufactures has been quite different and more positive. They have either refunded shipping or have provided us with free product for our time and trouble."
1,A dud,"Ours never worked as advertised. Automatic on function never came on. Manually turning it on would send it cycling through the phases of the moon, you could never turn it on to the current phase and leave it on that phase. Finally the CD wasn't included. Unfortunately it was a gift without a gift receipt, the store won't take it back, and I'm not paying to ship it to Uncle Milton."
3,Not impressed,"I bought this item because I happen to have an almost infatuation with the moon. I constantly take photographs of it and love looking at it. I was hoping this item would be more realistic, as the picture seems to represent it. However, when I got it I realize that it's very fake looking. Furthermore, the dilineations that are apparent when the moon is put on different fullness settings (i.e. full moon vs partial moon) is very fake looking. You can easily tell that there's a light inside. Maybe it's my fault for expecting something more realistic from a what's actually just a fancy night light, but with all the glowing reviews, I was expecting more. I suppose it functions well as an interesting nightlight, but don't expect anything more."
4,Moon in My Room - Moon Phase Night Light Toy,"The little boy we bought it for absolutely loves it, and it has made it more comfortable for him to sleep in his room as he was having a lot of trouble sleeping before. Great gift idea for the littlies."
4,Uncle Milton Moon in my Room,"This was a gift for my nephew who lives in another state. I received information that Anthony was really anxious to see the moon on his ceiling, and upset they had no batteries in the fridge. Soon batteries arrived and he was able to turn on the 'Moon in his Room' and thought it was really cool! A fun and educational way to learn about that bright light in the night sky."
2,Broke Right Away,"The concept of the toy is terrific, and my children really liked it - but it broke after 2 days of use. Bummer."
2,The 20 minute moon,This could have been SO much better if only the moon didn't shut down after 20 minutes. It's suppose to be to protect the battery life....it is VERY annoying.
3,Just Stopped Working,"My son really enjoyed this toy, then one night after a couple of weeks it just stopped working. Go figure."
1,broke after 5 minutes!!,We were so excited to get this going- THEN it just would not turn on anymore AFTER 5 MINUTES!! Changed to new batteries and everything--- so disappointing! I'm bringing it back.
1,did not work out of the box,"My son got this for his 6th birthday, and was very disappointed when the remote didn't work. The moon lit up, but the remote just didn't do anything. We tested the batteries, checked they were installed correctly, took the moon into a dark room, and still nothing. I contacted the Uncle Milton company and was told we could ""purchase"" a new remote! WHAT? This thing doesn't work out of the box, and I have to BUY a new remote?! I don't think so. Back to Amazon it goes."
2,Remote control stopped working,"I ordered this for my daughter for Christmas since she loves learning about the moon. Everything worked when we hung it up on Christmas then a few days later she mentioned that the remote no longer works. We have replaced the batteries but still nothing. The moon has now become useless since it is hung out of everyones reach and need a ladder to turn it on. Unfortunately, the packaging was thrown away so I can't even return it."
4,Uncle Milton Moon in My Room,"grand kids enjoying it. Somewhat cheaply made, but love to watch it while dozing off to sleep. Particularly like the automatic shut off"
3,Not a nightlight,"On the box it claims it can be used as a nightlight, it auto shuts off after 10 minutes. Grandson can outlast that!"
3,No response from Customer Service,"The remote does not work and therefore the moon phases do not work. I purchased this for my grandson, and my daughter completed the online form through the manufacturer's website about the defect almost 2 weeks ago and again on Jan. 8 but she has not heard from the company.Otherwise, my grandson loves the moon in his room!"
2,looks great but is a bummer,"well, I sent it back once I realized that not only the remote but also the moon is operated with batteries only - I immediately had doubts about this fact because I know out of experience how toys can be eating batteries ! so I checked the reviews and found all my apprehensions proven right. But not only does it eat batteries it also is very unpractical because you have to take the moon down from the wall every time you need to change batteries and when you want to use the automatic switch off feature to prolong battery life ! haha ! When I see a toy operating only on batteries I always wonder whether the toy companies have some contract with the battery producers ...this moon looked so great and promising but it is very badly thought through in terms of practicality"
3,Battery drain,"It looks great but it goes through batteries like crazy. It is really inconvenient to have to take it off the wall and turn it on every time you want to use the remote. It only stays on for a few minutes before the light goes out but within a couple days if you don't turn it off on the back of the moon, the batteries go dead. If it weren't for the battery issue, I would really like it."
4,fun,My seven year old loves having the moon on the wall. It works very well and allows you to change the stage of the moon. Worth the money we spent.
1,Non-Working Moon,"This would be a fun & educational toy if it worked! My twin boys were so upset when their new christmas toy did not work even once! If they had negative numbers for the stars I would use them because the company did nothing to reslove this issue. I will NOT buy Uncle Milton toys in the future, who needs more junk!"
3,moon,like it looks good on my wall with a picture of a wolf howling under it looks very real in recordings wish there where more colors it came in would enjoy a red or purple .
2,its a moon,"We got this in with nothing but the product. No interactive CD and not a single instruction. Uncle Milton does not have a easy number for you to call. it is all automated so... I emailed them, to no avail. They sent me a email telling they cared and would get right on this, LIES. I have heard nothing else from them. SCAM, product and lies, purchase. I WOULD NOT BUY THIS AGAIN, ohh, Maybe if it was 5.00, it would then be worth it. Only stays on for a hour and will NOT stay on like a night light. Looks just like a fake moon and neat, however, I am sure we could make the same thing for this price. Save your money, unless, you want a moon, on a nail, with a remote that turns on and last for 1 hr. This product is a joke and a rip off. Good luck! I gave this 2 stars for fun cause it has a remote and that made my 4yr old happy."
2,Children's toy,Products for children under the age of eight.The pale moonlight. There is no warmth.Will soon be on display at a garage sale.
1,Junk,I bought this for my kids who are obsessed with the moon. This is a piece of junk and they ask me why I bought it.
2,Disappointment for the whole family,"I ordered this as a last second christmas gift for my twin boys. It arrived on Christmas eve and we were so excited, put the batteries in it and ran upstairs to try it out. After 3 min of clicking the remote to make the cycles change, they walked out and have not touched it since. I was expecting a lot more from this toy then an expensive night-light. Maybe my expectations were a little high, but for based on the picture I was hopeful that it would be a great gift. If you want a unique night-light that turns off after 30 min then go for it, if you want to dazzle your children with the wonders of the moon then I suggest you look somewhere else."
4,cool surprise gift,"I purchased this gift for my 10-year-old daughter this year and it was a great hit, especially because she knew many of the other gifts she was getting. It's a nice looking addition to her room, and even serves as a temporary night light when preparing for bed. My only concern is that, after very few uses, the overall brightness seems to have diminished. The phases still light, but they are a little duller than when we first put it up. I have not yet looked to see if the bulb is loose, or if the batteries were old."
3,Really cool (until it stops working),"This is a very neat item. It looks absolutely realistic and it's a natural for a nightlight in a child's room. The problem? Ours stopped working about two months after putting it up. The remote stopped working right away, so I had to physically turn it on (not easy if it's hung high). Soon after that the switch stopped working all together...a real bummer. It's still hanging there, just doesn't light up :("
1,Booo! Does not work.,"I ordered this for my nephew, because he used to always say good night to the moon, so Iwas so excited when he received it. They tried batteries, bought new batteries, tried it severaltimes and nothing. I am extremely disappointed. I basically sent a headache to them instead of a present."
3,its ok,i was gonna give this as a gift but when it came the plastic window on the box was busted. so i returned it. it looks really cute. wish i coulda kept it.
4,Great product,"This is a great product. my 2 year old son loves it. before bed we turn off the lights, and he clicks the remote a bunch of times ""hiding"" the moon. He's fascinated with the real thing, so this is a hit!"
5,Wonderful educational toy!,"We saw this moon at my daughter's college - one of the kids had it hanging on their wall. My husband and I are both teachers (preschool and 5th grade) and wanted this for our classrooms. Not only does it teach about the phases of the moon, but kids love just watching it change. Moon in my Room would make a great gift for anyone!"
3,The moon,The full moon light is too bright. The automatic change of the moon is too quick at 5 minute interval. It is realistic. The batteries are not included.
4,Good for a 5-year old,"This is very interesting to our 5-year old, but I think after clicking through the cycles a few times, would quickly lose it appeal for older children.Product quality is fine as long as you hang it on the wall. It does not seem durable enough for actual handling/playing."
2,Cool moon... But,"Loved the moon idea for my sons room, but the battery last only a couple of nights. And it's a pain to keep changing batteries. It needs to be able to plug in or at least have a better battery life. I never could get it to stay on all night either"
2,"When it actually works, it's great.","We bought this for my 2 year old daughter who adores looking at the moon. The light is actually really neat, and she loved it. Here's the problem:after 2 exchanges I have yet to get a working remote. We decided to go ahead and let her sleep with it one night on the full phase (no remote, couldn't change it), and when I walked in at 3:30am that morning it had already burned through the brand new batteries. We're talking just over 7 hours of use and the batteries were dead. I'm not at all interested in going through a whole set of batteries EVERY NIGHT. Pretty disappointed, this is one of the worst purchases we've made."
3,Moon light,This was a little disappointing. Quality is okay. Nothing spectacular. It's not great...not terrible. Probably about right for the price.
4,"It does as described, just not super impressive in my opinion","It does exactly as described. On for a certain length of time, can choose to leave it one phase or cycle through them all. I just kept hearing from friends how incredible it is, and it doesn't do it for me. My 3 year old daughter was mildly impressed. She likes it because it gives off light, but that's about it. I didn't even get a ""wow"" from her though.She does LOVE her ladybug Cloud B Twilight Star Projector they sell on here. In fact, I LOVE that toy. I would spend money on that if you're undecided. The moon is ok, just not as impressive s I thought it might be after all they hype I heard about it."
1,Good while it lasted,"Great night light while it lasted (about a year). After that, the LED died and so did the moon. Tood bad."
4,Good Moon,Bought this for my nephew for Christmas. He loves it. Its not meant for a nightlight so he was kind of bummed to wake up in the middle of the night to no moon. But he loves it.
4,"good for entertainment, not so good for a nightlight","I purchased this product primarily to be a nightlight in my 4 year old's bedroom, but also to be an educational tool. It does not give adequate light when hung on the wall to be a nightlight. It does, however, provide some good entertainment pushing the button on the remote to the desired lunar phase. I would recommend waiting to purchase this product until the child is at the recommended age of 6 if you want to get any more out of it than just having a cool remote that turns the light on and off."
4,Uncle Milty's moon,Bought for the Mrs. Mounted in the bedroom above the door it gives a nice ambiance to the room. If only it would stay on longer...it would have got the 5th star!
3,Fun for a childs night light.,This is cute and my little guy likes it on to go to bed and then it slowly shuts off which is awesome.
3,Pretty cool,Pretty cool but you need about 6 batteries- both AAA & AA's. ( not included) I don't know how long they will last when the youngster falls asleep with the moon lit up.
5,Gift,"I bought this for a gift, my grandson loves it, Very happy with the purchase and received promptly. All it should be."
4,Larger and Cooler than expected,"Really cool, I bought it for my 5 year old nephew along with the Glow in the Dark solar system. Product came as described, quickly. As soon as he uses it I will update my review. Thus far I am pleased."
2,Nice night light... for a few months,This was given to my son as a gift. It was great as a night light and very neat to see the stages of the moon. I liked that it shut off on its own. The batteries lasted for three months which is longer than some of the reviews I've read. After that it sat on the wall for another four months. Today I took it down and changed the batteries. It worked again when I tested it. I shut it off and when I tried to turn it on later it was dead. I switched the batteries again to test it and they didn't work. Now the moon is completely dead. The whole thing is clean and dust-free inside and out. It's just dead apparently for no reason.
5,Great additions to a kid's room,"My five-year-old daughter is interested in space (at the moment), and we added this to her room. She loves it. It's easy to use (don't loose the remote) and acts as a little extra night light when she is first going to sleep (it's automatically set to a timer of about 20 minutes)."
3,not as good as original,I bought this for my son after the first one broke. (used it everyday for 7 years = it wears out) It is not as good as the original. The original remote would work from clear across the room. NOW you have to be right in front of the thing to get it to work! The original had a fantastic paint job too. The new one hardly has any dark gray on it at all! The ONLY improvement they made is where it doesn't come on as soon as the lights go out. (It will definitly save battery juice) Still my kid loves it. I just wish they had stuck to the original design.
3,Love(d) it. . . .,"Whole family loved it, yes love(d) it for the first two times it actually worked. Just stopped working, changed batteries still nothing but sadness."
4,gave it as a gift,The girls I bought it for love it. They told me all about the different moon phases and how the moon in my room works on their bedroom wall.
5,Great Gift,I bought this as a present for my niece's 2nd birthday (I now it says it's for older kids). She loves it and uses the remote to change the phases. It also serves as a great nightlight.
4,Moon in my Room,Our Grandson has shown a big interest in the moon lately so when I ordered this product I was hoping it would intrigue him even more. My expectations were met and he loves his moon. He likes to follow the the outside moon with his inside moon.
4,"Love the moon, Remote Too Loseable","Love the moon but the phases only work with the remote. Although we tried to keep it secure, the remote has vanished and the only function on the moon itself in on/off. Where can I get a replacement remote?"
5,A big hit,"I have a four-year-old who's fascinated by all things related to space, planets, stars, etc. And he loves his new moon. It's sufficiently bright and easy to hang up and use. It cycles through the moon phases and turns itself off after 30 minutes of inactivity. It really does look like the moon. And it took my kid around ten seconds to figure out the remote control, which works from all angles and from across a typical kid's room. It's not a precision optical device but it works fine for what it is. Requires 4 AA and 2 AAA batteries."
4,Moon lit up my room,"I bought this for my girl friend, she is 22, and she loves it more than most gadgets that she has. Really cool and easy to use. It's no wolf shirt, but I would recommend it."
4,Uncle Milty dressed in women's dresses,Educational! Purchased for Christmas gift for grandkids. They liked it at the time but I have nothing more to report.
1,Such a disappointing product!!!!,"I bought two of these, one for my grandkids and one for me.I followed the instructions and put fresh, new batteries in each. Neither one worked. I am an electrical engineer so I am pretty certain that I got the batteries in correctly, etc. Both were just non-working.I will buy nothing from Uncle Milton again."
3,Not very bright,"The moon does not light up very brightly, it's divided into compartments inside whose lines are visible when it's turned on and lit up in a dark room. So what you have is a moon with vertical lines. The remote adds a cool function that isn't really ever used after the first day. The darker grey detail in this photo is much lighter on the actual plastic moon. I never listened to the 15 min. CD"
3,"i think its cool, stepson couldn't be bothered.","i wanted to get my stepson a cool nightlight bc he's entering the afraid of the dark phase, even if he denies it. I ordered this bc i figured he could keep the remote in his top bunk with him and control the light as he felt necessary. well, who was i kidding? i dont know why i thought he'd keep up with the remote, which has vanished into the abyss that is his bedroom. You cant control all the functions of the moon without the remote so now the moon has found its way into the frightening depths as well. Itd be better if it had all the controls on the back as well as on the remote."
1,Run from this,"Wow. After installing batteries this product worked for about 2 minutes. I could not get it to work so I replaced the batteries. That worked for about 5 minutes then it died. Well, after more batteries and more of the same, I could not get the remote to function on ANY mode: on, manual, or automatic. More batteries, more failure after a brief run thru the moon phases. What a horrendous product. Its a shame this doesn't do what its supposed to do because its a great idea. Just doesn't work."
2,Shuts off in 30 minutes and you cant do much about it.,"Everything about this is good except for the one big problem, that is, it shuts off autmatically after about 30 minutes of being kept on. So, this cannot be used a night light, though the lighting effect, and the look and feel are perfect for a nightlight.I would have given this a 5 star rating, if it had the capability of changing this 30 minutes auto-off to a configurable duration of upto 12 hours or something like that."
2,Didn't last long,"Loved this Moon.Versitile for younger children as nightlight. Also great educational toy. My daughter LOVED her moon nightlight.I gave this moon 2 stars because we had it for < 1 year and it no longer works. I've tried everything and can't get it to work. It makes me very sad, as we loved it."
4,A great night lite,"My wife got this for my son last Christmas and he still loves it. You can change the phase of the moon and not even get out of bed to do it. The is also a CD that helsp your child learn about the moon. On the down side, it eats batteries."
3,Good if you understand what you're getting,"I bought Moon In My Room for 50 cents from a mother who said it was broken. Actually, it worked fine.In the ON position the moon will shut off if light in the room is bright enough, or turn off after a set period of minutes. The problem is, light fluctuates in my child's room throughout the day, causing the moon to turn on throughout the day. The batteries can easily be exhausted in one week, so use rechargeables.You can resolve the battery issue by remembering to manually turn the moon off using a switch located on its backside... every single morning. If you're prepared for daily maintenance, or weekly battery changes, then this is a great product. My kid loves it."
2,"disappointing, less educational that it might be","We enjoyed this toy for maybe a week. Then the batteries had to be replaced. I replaced them. They ran down within a few days. I did this several more times before giving up. Also, it would have been nice, and more educational, to have a programmable option for the moon to light up automatically each night, in sync with the actual moon phase."
2,Loved it until it broke!,Well this was a big hit and the whole family enjoyed it a lot - for about 2 days- then one of the lights went out. We opened up the back and found that the lights are LEDs so they are not replaceable. This was a huge disappointment. I looked at the instructions and it said before you return call Uncle Milton. So we did - every day this week - and they keep saying they are closed for the holiday which was 3 days ago. I contacted the seller and am hoping for an exchange. If it works... it is awesome!
3,Ok dvd,Not the best audio and video quality but for the avid fans it's the historic value that makes the connection.
1,Late Delivery but charged one day shipping,I had ordered this book for a one day delivery on wednesday evening and the shipping showed me that I would get the book by Friday. The book DID NOT ARRIVE ON FRIDAY but came in rather saturday and I was still charged a one day shipping. I dont want to pay for the one day shipping. Please refund my credit card.thanksDivya
3,"Great music, shame about disrespect of women","Kurtis Blow and Crash Crew were fantastic. Africa Bambaataa and the Soul Sonic Force had great music but spent too much time disrespecting women and they did an ill-advised In Da Club cover. The recording is presented almost as is, but it should have been edited down to just the music."
3,Good for manager but not for serious COM+ developers,"This book provides good overview of what COM+ is although some of topics are out of date, such as IMDB. If you are eager to find out what is COM+ all about, then this is a good reference book for you start off. If you are looking for more detail information about specific details(the whys and internals)about COM+ features, I doubt this is the book you want to look at."
2,Management Only,"EXTREMELY basic. Not worth your time if you are actually going to be programming. 100,000ft view of COM+ if it even got that low."
3,Very Basic - Better Help file,"I agree with the previous review. However, the reviewer is much more graceful than I am to give it 4 stars. I read Mr. Platt's previous book - The Essence of COM with ActiveX and I know he is capable of doing better than his latest one. I don't understand why would someone intentionally write a bad book. I also agree with the previous reviewer that there needs to be 2 books on COM+ one on VB and the other on VC. I suggest looking at Mastering COM/COM+ by Rofail/Shohoud, it covers both VB and VC++, it is actually a very good book on the subject. I have not reviewed it yet because I have not gone throw it all but, so far so good."
2,Not worth buying!,"This is a not worthy buying book. I bought it in Amazon, so, without flipping pages. The author expends much of the time showing things you can find in Sun's javadoc, with tiny examples. For example, I read on and on looking how to create a BufferedImage and came to nothing! If I wanted only commands, I could look in at Sun's javadoc. I bought the book expecting to find out how to stuff, not bla bla bla."
2,Good but not good enough,"I think Alfian Sa'at has a unique voice and this book of poems is poignant and piercing at times. However, I do object to him using the poetic form as a political tool of criticising the policies of the government.That being said, he does have artistic merit and when compared to local Singaporean poets, he stands up. However, internationally-wise, he is not good enough and we should stop comparing ourselves regionally."
3,Easy to listen.,"Sabse bada rupaiyya, Say na say na, Tadbeer se bigdi hui taqdeer, Right here right now, 9 parts of desire these are some songs from album.Most of the songs are from film Bluffmaster."
4,Great Music to go with a Movie with twists,"The music from Bluffmaster is fun and will get you moving. It is sprinkled throughout the movie appropriately. Abhishek Bachchan, following in his father's footsteps, sings the title song."
4,"Gives a good, fair overview of Mother Teresa","Knowing little about Mother Teresa to start with, I found the book seemed to objectively chronicle her life, even the controversial positions that she held that are usually ignored when she is spoken about. Although it becomes apparent that Mother Teresa was human and an imperfect being, this does not diminish the value she has to others as a role model."
1,Offensive,"I am asking myself why Ms. Sebba would devote an entire book to criticizing a woman who has given up any material possessions she may have had, located herself in an area stricken with poverty and disease (such as leprosy), and spent her life helping the destitute. It is offensive to read this knowing that the author sits in a comfortable residence in England as she searches to find fault with Mother Teresa. Has Ms. Sebba done more for the poor and destitute than Mother Teresa?"
1,Trite,"Dunne tries to make a modern Great Gatsby, but fails. The characters who are portrayed as having redeeming qualities are actually quite materialistic."
4,Love it!!!!,Full of the great gossip and high drama Dunne is famous for. I love how he makes you feel like you're right there with his characters!
4,"Witty tale of ""haves"" and have-nots""","I loved this story. It focused on new vs. old money and how they viewed each other and the world around them. At times, it was a tad slow but interesting nonetheless. I enjoyed the quirky humor of these characters and their money. There were a lot of different characters involved and I enjoyed all of them. This was definately a worthwhile book to read. Gus Bailey as a journalist who observes all of the activity is a charming character and I was rooting for him in the end."
3,"nice software, but book is poorly presented","While AutoCAD dominates the CAD field, ArchiCAD aims to do the same for architecture. The book has many examples of how traditional architectural tasks can be performed under ArchiCAD. You can see traditional floor plans being laid out. Plus a natural extension into different floors of a building. As well as 3d image rendering derived from the blueprints.For large buildings, or a group of buildings, there is also a neat feature of being able to define terrain that the buildings sit on. The text also discusses how to organise interior space, aided by reasonably realistic renderings.The problem with the book is that it has the format of a large glossy coffeetable book. You know, the artsy kind, with nice pictures on many pages. But if you want an actual user's manual, this text may be somewhat deficient. And that is the problem. The very title bills this as a user handbook. It does not live up to that."
3,Archicad,"A good book if all you need is several hundred pages of advertisements and booster talking points. Lots of nice projects and pictures, but no user information. Meaning, if you want this for instructional or how to purposes, you may save yourself a bit of frustration by just talking to yourself and saving the money. Don't be misled by the name."
1,junk to the extreme,"Same story as the below reviews. I followed the instructions, used the iron once, and it worked fine. Then the heating lights went out and it stopped working. What a disappointment."
1,junk,"I bought this wafflemaker a couple weeks ago. There weren't any reviews for it at the time, but I took my chances and purchased it anyway. Well, I sure regret it! We got to use this only one time. We cooked our first waffle just fine, filled it again with more waffle mix, then the heating lights went out, it stopped cooking and that was that. We were left with nothing but mush stuck to the griddle! I decided to be the first to write a review, but I see someone beat me to it-- the same thing happened to her."
1,Awful..,"I purchased this waffle iron, took it out of the box and cooked exactly one waffle before it quit working. The heat indicator lights went out, the iron stopped heating and waffles for breakfast became pancakes. I do not recommend you waste your money on such poor quality."
1,useless product,The Chef's Choice 820B never produced even color waffles and the 4th time I tried to use it (less than one month since purchase) it stopped working entirely. I wish I had read these reviews before I made an impulse purchased at a retail store. Don't buy this product!
1,Obviously a problem with this product...,"Based on 2 of the 3 previous reviews, it is clear that there is a production problem with this item. I had an even more frightening experience. I attempted to plug the cord in, and it shorted out a previously working outlet. (It didn't just pop the breaker--I now have to call an electrician to fix the wiring.) I experienced a large flash and pop, and the plug became scorched. Upon examination, I believe that the plug is defective. I am well aware that abnormalities and quality control issues can happen with even the best products, but 3 of the 4 reviewers had problems. I will be calling Edgecraft in the morning to report the problem."
1,Terrible Product. Waste of Money.,"I just came across this prodcut and recognized it from Spring of 2004 when I purchased this Chef's Choice, 820B waffle iron as a gift for my son for his birhtday. It was delivered to him and he used it about 2-3 times and it stopped working. He was able to get a refund from the company, but they did not refund him the original shipping cost of $6.45. When my son and I both wrote to the company, there was no response. Amazon did not respond, either. Apparently, the company, Kitchen Etc., went out of business. With all of the waiting, it became too late to disputer on credit card. What a hassle!I see it is not out of stock. Hopefully, they have removed it from Amazon to protect consumers."
3,Will stick with this repair prone waffle maker,"I've owned this product for over three years and love the way it bakes, especially the option for crisp exterior and soft inside waffles. However, for the second time the thermostat has failed so the unit is back at Edgecraft for about three weeks service time to make the repair. Am having waffle withdrawl with the length of repair time. The good news is they are very customer and service minded and have repaired the unit for this problem no charge even though the warranty had run out for the first failure, and now for the second repair. Aside from the reliability issue, I love this baker better than the other four I sold at yard sales."
3,mixed bag,lp has that good independent feel. style vary between a west cost feel to a garage style. one track is a total wast of time. this falls into the classification of one of those lps you have always read about as being a monster lp. but found out just because its rare dosn't mean its good.
3,K-9 Body guards,"Book is very good, but skips to many basics, and you must know somehting about training before buying it. Stories are good, and great pictures, and american bulldog people will love this book for that reason.Needs more details for beginners. Great for policemen."
3,K-9 Bodyguards,"Mike Harlow includes some beautiful glossy illustrations in his book on protection dog training, however you would be hard pressed to use it as a guidebook to training protection dogs, and you might actually get yourself into some serious trouble if you tried. In actuality he seems less interested in the specifics of the actual steps involved in the training, but more inclined to rescue the reputation of American Pitbull Terriers at every possible opprtunity. I enjoyed the book, but it certainly shouldn't be used to base a training program on."
1,Beware of methods that use excessive force-,"I cannot endorse any book that reccomends hanging a dog by his neck as a punishment for innapropriate agression. This method is so dangerous to both the dog and handler, it's a shock to me that a reputable pet press would endorse anything so brutal.There is a reason why locking jaw bulldogs are not as popular as other breeds more commomly used in protection and police work. Officer Harlowe goes on about his favorite breeds and fails to recognize others. A pit bull type dog is not for everyone. They are extremely strong and have a lowered body sensitivity, thus making them more difficult to handle while in drive. And in my humble opinion, there is such a thing as too much dog.If you want a training manual of any type, buy one that has more training information than macho cop war stories. It's common sense, but in this case, it bears repeating."
4,Well worth the price,"Infinity is a German jazz group and certainly shine with the help of Alphonse Mouzon. For 6 bucks, you'd be crazy not to buy this. Well recorded in 1992 . Check it out."
3,The Mind is more than a repository for sensation,"I was fooled by the title of this book. Or possibly my conception of mind is radically different than the authors. Humphrey's History of the Mind is a meditation on the link between sensation and consciousness. I my mind, I could spend time in a sensation deprivation device and still be fully conscious. More importantly, I could use my mind (intelligence) think deep thoughts. I guess I expected A History of the Mind to be much broader than a look at the senses. Sure I sense, but much more importantly I think intelligent thoughts."
1,Lazy and unfounded basis,"Appreciating an interesting but light read, I came to the following on page 40: ""So boundaries - and the physical structures that constituted them... - were crucial. First, they held the animal's substance in, and the rest of the world out. Second, ... they formed a frontier... at which the outside world impacted the animal"" This is a philosophical ethnocentrism, placing ones beliefs into an interpretation of what is viewed while presenting the material as if an objective viewpoint. He sneakily inserts the separate animal, an animal separate to us as we view and interpret it, but an animal that probably does not think at all, and just exists within its environment, not separate from it. The author separates the substance of the animal from the rest of the world - it is a viewpoint. The feebleness of this segment kept me from going further. What could follow from such an unfounded basis so lightly considered?"
3,Decent book,"This book covers the basic but it lacks more advanced material. The tutorials give you a good idea on how to get things done.One thing that bothered me were the numerous grammatical errors that really made understanding tough. Sometimes you have to reread and figure out what the author meant, not what he wrote.(I've given up on Carrara 5 due to many bugs and frustrations. I have yet to try 6.)"
2,For beginners only ---- Not really a handbook,"This book leaves out many features new to Carrara 5. It is not a very complete work and leaves much to be desired. If you have never used Carrara you may benefit, however, there are much better free learning resources online."
1,Great Photo! Beware!!!!!!!!!!!,"Look hard at that 5 inch hight measurement. It is a stretch thinking in terms of the tip of the nose on the upturned head. The tailless body is ,maybe an inch long. I have seen it in bins a number of times. It must be durable to survive that kind of retail treatment. I'll give it that. But after handling it and taking a good look, the over all quality is only fair, at best. Rather than enhancing some magical aspect of the creature, the transparent orange plastic cheapens the look of it.It would be over-priced at seven fifty. Anything higher than that is robbery. Shame on these guys. Wait for a bargain. There are lots of better dragons at this price.'nuff said, JPF"
1,Four Headed Dragon,"My grandson asked for a 4 headed dragon for Christmas. I had no idea what it was. I went on Amazon and there it was - I was so excited. The description of it was not correct. It seems to be a part of a set. For the price and the size of it- it was not acceptable so I sent it back, No hastles with Amazon."
4,International Intrigue In Cuba,"Hugh North is sent to either buy or steal plans for an advanced torpedo which are being sold by its inventor in Cienfuegos. The seller of the plans calls himself Alvarado but his real name is Doelger. He is a disgruntled American who was discharged from the U.S. Navy for dereliction of duty in l9l8. When North arrives in Cienfuegos, he finds plenty of competitors already there seeking the prize. Some are agents of their governments while others are merely adventurers in the game for profit. In one role or another there are representatives from England, France, Japan, Germany, Russia, Portugal and Italy. This is the first novel in the series in which North operates in a foreign country under orders from G-2 on a matter of international intrigue."
5,The only gum without fake sugar,"If you are concerned about the increase of fake sugar injected into our diet in everything from cough syrup to yoghurt to chewing gum, then this gum is for you. After searching far and wide, I found Glee to be the only gum made as gum always was made--with natural sugar as the sweetener. In addition, the flavor, which is long-lasting, is excellent."
1,A good courage not a good book,WOW! Bad book. I gave this book one star because it felt good to end the pain. If you want lots of cult facts this isnt the book for you. If you want a not very enjoyable read....READ THIS! What was the author thinking when she wrote this. It wasnt cool it wasnt funny it was bad.!
4,Good read,"Overall this book is a good read on a unwritten about subject. The events during Lee's surrender have been written many times, but not many have discussed how Appomattox was founded, who lived there, etc. Marvel does this, although the first couple chapters are a bit slow. However, during the war years, the text picks up and is more lively. Marvel's description of the differing personalties in Appomattox's history is very good too. The section on the post-war years did not go into as much depth however. Nor did Marvel go into much depth on the death of Appomattox or its rebirth as a national park. I have been to the park and this book gave me a better understanding of some of the things I saw. Overall, the book is very good, but Marvel did miss a couple things."
4,My Great Great Grandfather was a Blacksmith in Appomatox.,"A very well written, concise description of life back then. I bought the book because my great, great grandfather was a free African American Blacksmith in Appomattox Court House."
4,GREAT DVD BUT TO SHORT,"After watching this DVD I was happy I bought it, sound & picture quality are great. He was still pretty young, it is a treat to watch him play. Classic B. B. King this is a must have for any B.B. fan. Get it before it goes out of print like to many do so quickly. His playing is great, he is standing up for the whole show, but today with his health problems he can't stand to long. Also his vocals are fantastic, it is great to see him like this."
1,A meandering juvenile film with absolutely no merit.,"Tarl Cabot is once again spirited away to Gor to rescue Ko-Ro-Ba from evil. Unfortunately, even he cannot rescue this film from stilted dialogue (said of a dead man: ""There is nothing we can do.""), miserable acting (*falling* down a *sand dune* for no reason), and a complete lack of plot and characterization. The fight scenes will either make you laugh or turn your stomach. And Gor without nudity? Without tarns? Without authentic He Men? Without even a real slave girl? (But with a cardboard castle?!) Don't buy this film. It does not even resemble the books and it isn't worth a cent."
3,"fantasy movie with swords ,slaves and sorcery but not enough","Advice : see the movie first then read the book. that way the book does justice to this moviethe tale is based on Tarl, as an outlaw but once known as a hero. Upon returining to Gor, the counter planet to earth, he again faces drama of a primiative society in which only his skill and courage can contribute more sanity to the bizarre mixture of power and suffering of the tribes of people on the planet. The movie does not show as well the description that the book gives of the town and culture. The tarns (large birds) are not shown and the priest kings are not introduced well from the movie so maybe the movie should get an overhaul. please make a 1990's version of this movie...more chains (for slaves), more swords, more gore and more exciting..."
1,Minus 5 stars would be more like it.,"All I can say is, this movie deserved everything it got when it was blasted by the Mystery Science Theatre 3000 crew."
1,"Bad Headgear, round 2","The first movie in this series was so bad; I had to see this one just out of morbid curiosity: Could the trend continue? Yes, it could and did. IIRC there is a lot of mismatch between the sound track and the 'action' on the screen -- the most glaring has to be the dramatic orchestral build up for a simple walk across the desert... no bad guys or action in sight. Just a simple walk across the ... uh-huh ... yup. You get the point."
1,Poorly documented and not worth the money,"Luckily my company picked up the tab, else I would have returned it. This book seems to be cooked up by some DBA's out to make a buck. Many of the scripts wouldn't work just from viewing them. The documentation was not detailed enough to keep a novice from potentially making a critical mistake if one were to run these without first understanding the script. Scripts could have been more user friendly by using variables instead of having to hard-code the intened object. Poor work..."
2,"Thin, thin, thin","If you have some time on your hands and want to line-by-line debug/modify/enhance a set of scripts that were originally written for Oracle 7, then buy this book. Otherwise, take a pass.Three years after it was published, there still is a need for Oracle Scripts: not because of any inherent excellence, but because the tools Oracle itself provides are somewhat obtuse. Be aware that the scripts reside only on the accompanying CD and are buggy. Get updates from the O'Reilly website.As some other reviewers have noted, the scripts are targeted for UNIX DBAs. Conversion to NT platform is not difficult, but you're buying the book to avoid unnecessary coding, aren't you? Lastly, and most annoyingly, there is very little supporting documentation in the text."
2,Book is for Unix (Should have been labeled so!),There are a few useful scripts but I have to work more than I should to make them all work in an NT environemnt. The best two scripts 'alertlog' and 'every5' were written for Unix and I cannot use them as is w/o MUCH conversion. Also the book is VERY light on explaining the scripts (no source in book - impossible to review - scripts are only on CD). The best book on scripts so far is the Oracle Press 'PL/SQL Annotated Archives' by Loney. Now THAT book was worth ten times what I paid for it. It had many useful scripts ready for cut and paste.
1,beware of these scripts - They are dangerous,"Many of the scripts in this book DO NOT work. While there are several time-bombs in these scripts, the most distressing was using the script to punch views from Oracle. The script is WRONG, and does not include column aliases from DBA_TAB_COLS. I corrupted my database with this mess, and I would not recommend this book to anybody unless they have a death wish."
4,"Nice songs, but many promote stereotypes","I grew up in Mexico listening to Cri Cri. I was delighted when I received these CDs for my own children. But I was then surprised to notice that several of the songs are racially and culturally insensitive. ""Negrito sandia"" is the first example to come to mind. These materials were all developed at a time when the world was not tuned into the perception issues we can create in children by promoting stereotypes, or by not embracing diversity. Even today, Mexico has a long way to go in accepting racial and cultural differences. Since my kids are still small, I am circunventing this problem by not playing the songs that I consider offensive. When they are (much) older and better prepared to understand the context and the meaning of the lyrics, I will sit down with them and let them listen to the entire album."
5,Right on Em and Em!! (see reviews),I couldn't have said it better. Read Em and Em's review. I agree whole heartedly!!
5,great,Lost my copy of this book. Every time I looked for it I kept telling myself I should buy another. Im glad I finaly did.
2,Not much new information for MCSE,"As an MCSE I'm always looking for new resources which will help me to better serve clients and learn more about products. I've been looking for a great resource for Exchange for quite some time. After reading reviews of this book I thought I had found the resource I was looking for. Couple the reviews with the great books that O'Reilly puts out and this book seemed too good to be true. Unfortunately for me it was too good to be true. After reading the first few chapters I started doing some major skipping ahead and skimming. Alot of the information that I found I had already read on Microsoft's website. If you're new to Exchange this could possibly be the book for you, unfortunately in my case I have to return the book and keep searching."
4,Prudent,"Proverbs 22:3 A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself: but the simple pass on, and are punished.This is the core of this message. Be vigilant, be ready, be aware. Troubled times are coming, they may not get here in my lifetime, they might get here tomorrow...Either way, consider this from proverbs: 6:6 Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise: 6:7 Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler, 6:8 Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest. 6:9 How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?We shouldn't be lazy, but active and involved.This is what the author is trying to get to (sometimes long windedly..and 2 examples are usually enough, 200 is overkill)I do recommend reading/listening to everything chuck produces. (acts 17:11 applies here as well)"
2,Elite: 50'x,"Was happy with the selections and the artists; however, the quality of the recording left a lot to be desired. Was going to return it for a refund, but didn't get around to it."
4,Buena compilación de exitos,"Yo crecí con Miguel Mateos en la epoca en que la radio mexicana empezaba a abrir las puertas al Rock en Español a fines de los 80's. El primer concierto al que fuí fue al de Miguel Mateos. El CD trae las rolas esenciales para que lo conozcan la gente que nunca lo ha escuchado y las necesarias para traer viejos recuerdos a todos aquellos nostalgicos que conocen su material. Rolas como Atado A Un Sentimiento, Lola, Cuando Seas Grande, Y Sin Pensar y Beso Frances son las gemas de su discografía. Solo falta una de sus mejores y más famosas rolas, Es Tan Fácil Romper Un Corazón. Si incluyera esta canción el CD estaría completo."
5,he Purr-Fect Eartha,"This is a fantastic CD. If you like Eartha or just starting to listen to her, this is a good ""Starter"" CD."
5,One of our FAVORITES!,This is such a great book. I bought one for several friends we loved it so much. It is very sweet and perfect for a young child.
3,Would have been cute...,"If I didn't receive this book with two of the front cover corners cut off and an inscription on the inside...really? Like New? I don't think so, but nice try."
4,Excelent 'Holdsworth & zappa influenced music',"If you liked those fast runs of bass, vibraphone, keys and guitar in unison, then this is filled with that zappa-esque styled jazz-rock-classical-avant kind of music. Machacek also brings something new to the table with his own vision and very well thought, detailed, compositions, AND let's not forget his incredible playing technique...really no one to compare him with. There are 3 trio tracks which are a bit more in the jazz side of things which are also mind blowing. Don't miss it!"
5,makes scooping the dog food easy,I keep the dog food in a rolling container and this scoop helps me quickly measure the perfect amount for our pup each morning. love it!
1,"One-sided, uninformative, repetitive","I wanted to like this movie. I feel that the issues they are discussing are important. The idea of the movie was excellent, but the realization is really upsetting..Basically, there was no real discussion of a variety of problems that educational system faces nowadays. The one problem the movie was discussing over and over again was long hours, little money. That's it. Which is exactly why it was so boring and so repetitive.And it represents only one way to look at thing. This lopsidedness makes it looks like a really long commercial promoting teachers - nothing wrong with that per se, but then again, I paid money to watch that, and I feel I should get something a little more interesting for my dollar."
2,Teachers complaining about how bad they've got it.,"Several teachers are profiled. Even though they all knew how hard teaching would be and how little it paid they don't mind complaining about how hard it is and how poor they are. Nobody in the movie has any self respect. Wonder how long anyone of these people would last in a career that was really hard, really low paid or really demeaning like oyster shucking, slaughterhouse worker, or septic system plumber. There is no counterpoint provided or any critical examination of the issues raised. Some of the conclusions reached, especially with regard to how much teachers SHOULD be paid, are the result of really wild assumptions. There's a better documentary about teaching and it's entitled ""Waiting for Superman."""
1,Teacher Union Propaganda!!,"This is obviously made or sponsored by the teacher's Unions!! The Amazon review said something like 2/3s of teachers HAVE to work 2 jobs ""just to make ends meet!!"" This is pure BS with teachers in my city starting at $40K and most earning $60K, some more, for 8.5 months work!!! Tell the guy working at Target who pays the taxes to support these teachers that they are underpaid!! NOTHING GOOD can be said about a movie that is this biased! Movies are meant to entertain--NOT have a political agenda for a 'special group' that wants to bleed the taxpayers dry!!"
1,bad signal,I have been able to receive the signal once from Ft. Collins only once. I've started over twice and even tried putting clock outside.
4,Equity Time USA 87310 Atomic Wall Clock with Indoorand Wireless Outdoor Temperature,"It keeps accurate time and sets day-light savings time automatically. It will be much better if the product size is BIGGER. That is BIGGER SCREEN to show time, date and temperature."
4,Great for the price!,"Quite happy with this purchase. Not the most substantial stands around, but I'm using them to hold M-Audio AV40 computer monitors, which aren't very big, and these stands are the perfect fit for them. Easy to assemble and adjust. There are no dimensions for the base listed anywhere that I saw, but if you're worried about a tight fit on the floor, each side of the triangle measures just shy of 16""."
3,Flimsy & unstable if used at full height with Yamaha NS10's,"3 stars because they weren't too expensive, but I definitely don't feel confident that these will not fall over when slightly bumped."
5,Very much like chicken soup for the everyday soul.,Small Worlds by Robert Klose creates for the reader a poetic feeling for ordinary things in everyday life. It is an easy and entertaining read perfect for curling up by a warm fire on a cold day. The stories he tells are very discriptive and gives you the feeling of being there. River Pumpkins and Joe Piranha Days made me laugh out-loud while reading. A great little book I would highly recommend.
5,Because the other way has an invalid checksum,Has someone actually tried to order this? What happens?
1,Mastering Nothing,"You will not be mastering in anything by reading this book. The book, basically, tell you where to find different funtions in the programs. You could accomplish that by looking around the program for a few days. When it comes to Layers, Frames, CSS, and other advanced topices this book will leave you high and dry. I don't even think that this book deserves the one star that I gave it. I want my money back."
1,Mastering dreamworks & Fireworks 4,"...I thought I was buying a book that would help me learn these programs, was I ever wrong! Poorly layed out with no logical flow. It doesn't provide the most obvious information needed to even start. For example: Setting margins, cutting images without keeping the whole canvas, proper use of layers. I could go on and on. A total waste of paper. Try Sandee Cohens book it will provide what this garbage did not. ..."
5,Upstairs Girls: Prostiution in the american west,This was not an x-rated book! It was as a matter of fact and very informative.It was really great and interesting reading. Opened your eyes about how fortuate we are to be born in this time.
3,Michael Gough Should Never The Good Guy,"A nice little twist movie with the begining and end working well. While parts of the middle section drag going on and seemingly ever on.Michael Gough is always at least interesting.But not so much when playing,as he is here,the hero. Not happy with the quality of the print or sound either. At best both are only OK.This is of course a rare and hard to see picture.I rather wish I had'nt tried so hard."
3,Much too fast paced to enjoy!,"I have loved the Temps from childhood, the original David Ruffin and Eddie, but I have adapted to Dennis & Tyson. This performance, being LIVE, is expected to be uptempo, but this is RIDICULOUS! The music & singing was done so quickly it hardly gave me a breath to enjoy the songs! I found myself hungering for just ONE song sung at a distant memory of what it once was. If you care to sing along, this is NOT the tape for you. Too many slow songs sung at breathtaking speed. Look for a better live version. I was disappointed."
1,Save the bucks!,"Do NOT waste your money on this DVD! This is not the Temptations that we all knew and rocked too . . . yes, they are the ""Temptations"" of 1983, but this group (talanted as they may be) do not stir the emotions the original Temptations gave us. Buy the 1998 movie for $9.99 and get the ""feel"" of the Temptations, albeit it is actors performing all the roles."
1,"Dead, NOT ALIVE","Sorry, this doesn't pass the muster. It IS NOT the original Classic lineup of the Temptations! Oh, there's a couple of them still there but the magic is gone. The group that made the 60's sounds come true is long dead. This is a ghost of the Big 5. Don't bother with this one."
1,One Star Is Too Many!!!!!!,"I saw the video up until Dennis Edwards attempted to sing Ain't Too Proud To Beg. I had to turn it off. I just could not see anymore. These were not the Temptations. These were wannabes. I was very disappointed. Where is my Paul Williams, David Ruffin, and Eddie Kendricks?"
4,The Temptations Live in Concert,"I'm too young to remember the original Temps. But since watching Otis Williams, Melvin Franklin, Dennis Edwards and Richard Street LIVE I feel as though I've received a little visit to the past. I love The Temptations, past and present! This video of them sing is wonderous."
5,Spectacular!,"A magnificent show. It features an absolutely astounding performance of I Wish It Would Rain, immediately followed by a super funky non-stop medley- Cloud Nine/Psychadelic Shack/Runaway Child, Running Wild. Dennis Edwards is the epitome of cool. It's unfortunate that the show only lasts an hour!"
3,an ok randition of The Temptations,"Im sorry, but it was painful to see has-beens try to take the place of greats like David Ruffin, Eddie Kendricks and Paul Williams, but it isnt Pauls fault, Eddie had his thing, and Ruffin was out of control. I thin Otis and Melvin should have hung it up after Eddie left. Its a good way for performers to learn some of the greatest choreography ever, by some 40 year olds. Dennis singing Aint too proud to beg is...bad."
3,"A point of view from the ""Sixth Temptation""","It is great to see that there are still Temps fans all over the world getting on line for information about the ""Greatest Male Group"" ever!!!I had the pleasure to sing with the Temps on national TV in 1991. The lineup then was Otis, Melvin, Richard, Ali-Ollie Woodson, and Ron.Although there will never be another lineup that comes close to the original, my opinion is that the line up with Dennis and/or Ali-Ollie Woodson as lead singers is competetent. Of course since my friend Melvin passed, their sound just isn't the same!!! The bottom line is, that in 1983 these guys were pushing 40 years old and still working up a sweat. I give them credit. If you want to practice some of the Temps moves, you can study from this film."
2,I am a true fan.,"I was disappointed in this video, but I would like to know who are those guys, there is one group that can do the things that the Temptations did and that is the Temptations themself's you can't fool real fans, and believe in me I am a real fan. What happen to the real Temptations that were suppose to be in this video."
2,disappointed,"We were greatly disappointed in this video, as will be all serious fans of the original TEMPS. Who are these guys in this video? Only one of the original members of the group (Otis Williams) performs in this live concert at Harrah's in Atlantic City. Not in the video are Eddie Kendricks, Melvin Franklin, David Ruffin, and Paul Williams . It is strange that all of the originals except Paul (already dead when this video was made) appear for about two minutes at the beginning to introduce the group, but the actual performers are different. I think the introduction was just some hastily arranged meeting (Ruffin won't even look at the camera nor speak). Don't waste your money on this one; you will surely be disappointed."
1,Use Netflix before you buy,"If it's not Ruffin or Edwards, Franklin, Kendricks, & Williams, it's NOT the Temptations, just five black guys who can harmonize and move a little. Not the same thing at all. My recommendation, rent before you buy to be sure."
1,The Magic is Gone,"Usually when one wants the Temptations, they want the classic group that started it all and this video doesn't quite measure up. Missing are the voices and legends Ruffin, Kendricks and Williams. This version, one of many lineups of the Temptations after the Great singers of My Girl and Get Ready were gone, are somewhat older and slower here and aren't doing the smooth footwork of the originals nor do they have the same vocal prowess. Melvin still has the great baritone but he was never a lead singer and Dennis does his later, 2nd generation Tempts hits, but no one in this lineup jells or grooves like the big 5. The magic is gone."
3,No Nostalgia In This One,"Upon viewing this concert for the first time, I was highly disappointed. I knew this was not the five original Tempts, but even with Otis, Melvin and Dennis still there,the sound was way off. One important missing factor is The Funk Brothers Motown sound which added so much to every song. Dennis and Richard could do nothing with the songs that David sang lead on. Dennis's voice sounded almost shot, but Richard has a great voice,it's just not the sound of the Tempts. These guys do give their all and if you just want to say you saw the Tempts live, buy it. If you want to hear the music like it originally sounded, get the CD with the Temptations live in concert or buy the movie ""The Temptaions""."
2,I tried to like it,"Having grown up listening and having watched the original 5 in concert, I hoped to see the same magic, sadly I didn't. I saw these Tempts live around this time (1983) and I haven't returned to any of their concerts since. Why do groups think that singing the old songs at a faster pace, improves the song. Don't they know we want it the way it was.... The original way. Dennis sings Dennis songs great: PAPA WAS A ROLLING STONE: but not David's songs Dennis' way. There are highlights: OLD MAN RIVER: Melvin Franklin still had it. CAN'T GET NEXT TO YOU: TOO SHORT, JUST MY IMAGINATION: NOT BAD. Well we get whats available, lets hope the MOTOWN vaults let loose with some good collections. The new Dvd The Temptations: THE DEFINITIVE PERFORMANCES 1965-1972 gave me the shot of nostalgia I needed."
1,Nothin' without Ruffin',"This isn't the Temptations. The real Temptations are the Classic lineup with David Ruffin, Eddie Kendricks and Paul Williams. It ain't nothin' without Ruffin'"
4,temps,great songs on this video...im in a singing group and we have done songs off this c.d. this is great
1,Front Cover,"Maybe its just me, but why is Glenn Leonard on the cover, if Ron Tyson is in this particular video?"
4,Was perfect for the girls!,Arrived on time. Girls love. Wish had more scratch sheets. Would recommend for clean and simple fun. Four year old gift.
2,Un thriller cousu de fil blanc,"La seule qualité de ce livre est de mettre en évidence le laxisme dans la préparation et l'inspection des aliments et les risques des infections au E. Coli. La psychologie des personnages est superficielle et l'intrigue cousue de fil blanc. Le Dr. Kim Reggis qui veut dénoncer les responsables de la mort de sa fille est d'une naiveté déconcertante en plus d'avoir un caractère impulsif et n'ayant aucun contrle sur ces émotions. Il est supposé tre un chirurgien cardiaque émérite, le peu de contrle sur ces émotions le rend un personnage peu vraisemblable. Il fonce tte baissée sans prendre les précautions les plus élémentaires, résultat on peut prédire 20 pages à l'avance dans quel bourbier il va s'enfoncer. La fin du livre nous laisse une patte en l'air. Bref je trouve que ce bouquin est mal écrit, que la trame est simpliste. C'est le premier Robin Cook que je lis et probablement le dernier."
2,"Great Music, Poor Potty Training","I bought this for my grand-daughter, and here is my daughter's reviews of how this product is working (or not) ""Hmmmmm.... she LOVES the music more than the potty itself. We listen and dance to the ""potty"" song everyday- but there has been little progress with the actual potty. I think the way to go for her may be the attachable seat that goes on top of the real toliet. Otherwise she carries the potty around from room to room and treats it like a seat. I think getting something that looks more like a real toliet would have worked better. Or perhaps she was going thru a phase that is not over yet, so maybe she will get into it again after a few weeks. Thanks, anyway."" I don't find this very encouraging, so I wish I had purchased something else."
4,Ok potty,I got this potty after my son rejects the toilet potty adapter. The potty size is just nice for my 2yrs old son. Portable and plastic looks good.Pros? Quite troublesome especially he still needs some help to pull his pants down and remove totally before he can sit on the potty.
2,"Cheap potty chair, with cute CD.","The only redeeming quality of this item was the cute CD that accompanies it, my son seemed to like it. But the potty was very basic and kinda cheap in quality, but not too bad, definetly NOT worth the price, but I got it with a gift certificate that someone gave me thank god, I am still looking for a better potty chair at an affordable price."
4,A great potty chair!,"I bought this potty chair for my son who is 21 months old. He really likes the chair, but really isn't excited about the sing-along CD. I had to buy another CD for him, to me it wasn't a CD that kids could follow and sing too. But the potty chair was really nice and my son got adjusted to it really well."
1,Additional Lab Fees Required!,"For each kit used (and at least two test kits are recommended), a $15 lab fee is additional for ""Standard"" lab results. For a couple dollars more, use the First Alert brand. The only additional cost is for 3 or 4 postage stamps."
1,Don't buy this,There is a $30 lab analysis fee + an additional $10 if you live in NJ. This is on the package but not visible if you are buying from Amazon.
1,Amazon misleading,There is no mention of additional fees on amazon's description. As of 10/3/10. Will return.
3,Hard to use.,My house is mostly open concept and I have a dog. I haven't used it because no way I can carry out the instructions.
1,Meaningless test,"This type of test is meaningless, such a short term test done by amateurs who are not trained and certified and especially not following EPA protocol will give useless results."
1,This Company is a scam,"These guys ripped me off and have done the same to many others. They cashed my check and never completed the anlaysis of my samples. Then they have given me the runaround for over 6 weeks, refusing to submit a refund! I went to the BBB to complain and that's when I saw they do this regularly. Take a look at Yelp or the Better Busines Bureau (where they have an F rating). When you are doing the search on either of these sites the name of the company is Pro-lab, Inc. Their address is 1675 N. Commerce Pkwy. Weston, FL 33326 Tel: (954) 384-4446."
1,EXTRA LAB FEE REQUIRED!!,"I have not used this test kit as yet - because I am deciding whether or not I wish to pay the $30 lab processing fee. I had believed that the kit was all inclusive, but there is that small $30 extra lab processing fee! Was I wrong that the write up for this product merely said that you would have standard lab results within one week!? You have to blow up the box picture to see that there is indeed an extra $30 standard lab processing fee. Product description could have and should have been more descriptive and honest!! I'll expand pictures in the future to read the fine print and NOT trust the mere description!"
1,A regular clip joint,"Yep, they charge you an additional $30+ for processing the test and this isn't indicated anywhere on the packaging. It's a necessary service, but it's dishonest to not tell you about these charges."
1,Check cashed but not results provided.,"We completed the test as specified and submitted with a $30 check. The check was cashed seven weeks ago and we have never received the test results. I have left voice mail requests for information, to no avail. This is a scam as far as I can see."
2,not too satisfied,soungs weren't as great as I had expected. I remember listening to this music in the 90's and I liked some but being unable to listen to them prior to purchasing them was a bad idea.
3,Great translation but paper/printing lacks quality,"The NIV was the translation of the Holy Bible that I was able to truly read and understand as a teen and young adult. This ""inclusive language"" T-NIV only makes the NIV even better; this is not a ""liberal"" or ""progressive"" translation in the ways that some very conservative Christians have painted it.I do agree with the second review that the print quality leaves something to be desired. I see the same ""bleed through"" from using very thin paper that makes it lesss easy to read, which is why someone wants a large-print Bible. I cannot recommend this edition."
1,Poor Quality,"I love the TNIV version but not this particular edition. The pages were terribly thin with very noticable bleed-through from the opposite page. The words of Christ are supposed to be in red but are actually a faded pink on most pages. All this makes it very difficult to read, which of course defeats the purpose of buying a larger print Bible. I'm really disappointed that Zondervan would release such a poor quality Bible."
3,Thinline TNIV Bible,"Ok, but ad should have shown an image of an inside page. This item described as a large print bible, but font does not look like large print."
4,Provocative dramatic essay,"I'll admit I had expected this play to be another political statement about disappearing languages and the hegemonic powers that threaten them--either that or a celebration of Irish Gaelic (I'm more with Joyce than Yeats when it comes to provincial sentimentality about a nation's older tongue). But Friel manages to make the reader/spectator ponder the seriousness of what can be lost in the translation of the marginal language into the majority discourse. In some instances, the signifer and signified, the sign and its referent are irrevocably separated. In such cases, the resulting loss is not merely to the ""richness"" of a country's culture but to human consciousness itself. What we can't say we can no longer know or even think."
5,the loss of languages,"an eloquent, moving play about the love of one's native language (Irish) and the plight of lost languages (Latin, ancient Greek, and so on). Of course, it was written after the largely successful revival of the Irish language. There's your delayed ""happy ending."" (It's not the same, though, not by a long shot.)the nice thing about friel's play is that he conveys the machine of colonialism with the appropriate complexity--it isn't ""bad Englishman, good Irishman,"" but something much more complex. sometimes people like Owen, unwittingly or not, sell out their own. Sometimes others, for example the English soldier here, are part of the colonial apparatus, but not consciously or intentionally--and such people may end up being the colonized culture's greatest champions.I liked it better than Dancing at Lughnasa. It reads well--and a lot of plays don't."
2,Brian Friel should be forced to eat every copy published!,"What the hell was he thinking?! the book is as exciting as a German film festival - and makes as much sense! The play starts in the middle of nowhere, spends several acts going nowhere, and finishes(so I'm told, though I fell asleep 1/2 way through) at exactly the same point at which it started.Friel should be crucified."
3,Shirley Jackson's weakest stories are collected in this book,"These are the weakest stories of Shirley Jackson. Thus, she never collected them when she was still alive. Please buy her OTHER books. They are so much better."
5,Pokemon Advanced Box Set Vol 2,"Pokemon Advanced Box Set Vol 2I bought this as a gift for my son who is still a huge Pokemon fan. He loves it and watches the DVDs by himself or with his friends. My review is simply based on my son's joy, so for the Pokemon fans out there . . . a great buy!"
2,"5 stars for the man and the technique, 2 for the video","Jim Chapin is a legend and a great drummer to say the least. It's great to learn this technique from the man himself. The beef I have with this movie is that the entire thing is rolls on a snare drum. No set whatsoever, snare only, same roll throughout. It's good in that you get a lot of repetition on the technique, but I really hoped it would have demonstrations of him on the kit as well and it does not."
3,wrong info about shannon hoon...,"This book says that Shannon Hoon was 23 and died of a heroin overdose. That is incorrect. He was 28, and died of a cocaine overdose."
1,Didn't work,I bought this for my husband since he hates to iron and doesn't like to spend money on dry cleaning. The first one I received did not heat up and neither did the second one. We both were terribly disappointed.
4,Damaged Product,"The product works fine. I ordered the more exprensive one after I read reviews from others on Amazon. My husband likes the presser. It does a good job pressing his pants. However, it was damaged in the box when we received it. We decided it was too much trouble to send it back. The box was torn and the presser had a chuck knocked out of it."
1,"Useless, Completely Useless",This thing was a joke. It never got hotter than warm spit. The timer didn't work and it did absolutely nothing to press my pants!! This thing was so bad it makes me mad just thinking about it. I sent it back within 48 hours. Do yourself a favor and don't bother.
5,Presser Review,"I have been using a pants presser since 1990 after returning from a visit to London. My hotel roon had one. I bought this one for my son-in-law. He loves it.Only difficulty was the first one arrived damaged in shipment. Amazom was SUPER in replaceing it, no questions, they simply wanted to keep the customer happy. I am. Well Done Amazon."
1,Does nothing to wrinkle pants,"Don't buy this thinking you will never iron your pants again.I tried both wrinkled and ironed pants on this thing and saw nothing that would justify its purchase.Plus, only the bottom portion (the legs) go into the machine. This means that the part around your butt, front, and waist is left to itself. And if you are 6 feet and above, then only about 80% of the legs go into the machine. It is designed for short people.It is nothing but a fancy closet appliance. You are way better off with an iron, and the plies you get with an iron are a billion time better than what this thing promise to deliver.I returned it the next day."
2,works but not what I expected,I also was disapointed with the product but maybe I expected too much. It does seem to perform an adequate job of getting out those wrinkles around the knees by pressing a pair of pants from the bottom of the pockets down to the cuff. I am 6-4 so it appears that the machine might cover more area on a shorter pair of pant. But if you're expecting to never iron your slacks again forget it. It does not touch the pockets or butt area. But then looking at the machine I now realize it was never meant to do that anyway. I was hoping to discove a secret device to make my life easier and me look better. Instead I have a curiosity that I'm not so sure I want to show my friends.
5,"It's not your mother's dry cleaner, but ..................","Bottom line it does what it is suppose to do, press your pants.Does it press your pants as good as a dry cleaner would? No, but it is fairly close.Will the product save you money? You bet it will, I cut my dry cleaning bill by 40 percent the first week I had it.Is it easy to operate? Yes"
2,Very Dissappointed,"I've owned one of these before and liked how it performed, but the current version of this product is poor. First, it doesn't have the capability to take the knee wrinkles out like prior versions, probably because it is made with cheap, fragile plastic where it counts most, the upper strectch lever and the ""fancy"" new way to catch the bottom of slacks doesn't work most of the time. I am looking for a better unit. Too bad good companies cheapen there product to the point that they become just another commodity provider of junk."
1,Not for Tall People,"The Corby does a so/so job in helping your pants with the creases and does remove wrinkles. I'm 6 4"" so my pants where to long to fit in the Corby. If your short I guess the results would be minimal. I understand that it's not suppose to crease the upper area of the pants, but they look funny not being completely pressed. Save your money, I will be returning mine ASAP."
5,Works very well,"Had occasion to use my PanaVise circuit board holder last week. The board I was working on was quite large and unbalanced w/ some heavy components (transformers) off center in one section of the board. The circuit board holder held up fine to the rework I was doing - including flipping the board over to see its top and bottom sides.I use my PanaVise equipment in the field - so it has to be mobile (not affixed permanently to a work bench). I have my PanaVise base mounted onto the Panavise tray base mount (model 312). The tray's generous circumference and hefty weight enabled me to work on the over-sized and unbalanced board w/o it all toppling over. It was quite stable. PanaVise offers another weighted base mount (model 308) that would also work well in this application.In summary, the PanaVise circuit board holder works well and as intended when mounted on a stable base."
2,Kind of disappointed....,"I'm not sure who their target audience is on this album (Evora fans or danceclubtechno fans). Judging by the fact that there are no reviews for this cd, apparently no one is buying it!I have a couple Cesaria Evora cd's. I love her voice, love the music; it just seems like you're on a tropical ocean village when you're listening to her cd's.I also like a fair amount of dance/techno/electronica/ whatever you want to call it. So I expected this to be an interesting, good cd.It somehow misses the mark. Most of the songs are really bland and a bit repetitive on the remixing. They don't add a lot to the originals; rather, they take away from the originals. You lose that world-ly feel that you get on the originals.Therefore, I wouldn't recommend this one new or used. I'd stick to the regular albums only."
3,Not what I expected,"Being a fan of Cesária Évora, I was anticipating a bit more from this album. In truth, I had not realized that this was a club re-mix of her work. To me, she stands on her own, and doesn't need this treatment. It might be good, but it is not my style, and I can't properly judge it, hence the three-star rating."
4,barefoot remixes,"i thought i'd never hear something like this. well, ok i kind of thought i would, what with the blue note releasing so many of their songs to be remixed by the ""hottest"" dj's around right now. the results are always 50/50, some of it's cringeworthy, and some it is innovative and refreshing.club sodade teeters much more heavily on innovative and refreshing. i remember my first cesaria evora record. it was Diva Aux Pieds Nus and it came out around 88. i was taken aback by the naturality of it all and the true colour of her voice. this record maintains that sensibility while taking to a 21st century vibe, complete with remixes by Carl Craig, Francois Kervorkian, and Kerri Chandler. i personally dig carl's the most, but overall, it's a wonderful disc to have on during a sunday afternoon or a drive through green pastures."
4,Easy read,"I used the Passport series books when preparing for A+, Network+, Security+ and Server+ and passed them all. I would recommend using this book along with another bigger textbook and some free online study guides. (Check out MCMCSE.com)The one thing I like about this series is that it's very easy to read and will help you to understand things. If you have a backround in IT, then this is the book for you when preparing, but if your new and don't have much experience, some things might not make sense because things arn't explained in much detail."
4,Response To Burger Flipper,"Burger.....what possesed you to think that the network+ exam would help you with web pages. do you think being able to wire up a cat 5 or enviornmental issues for servers would do it. Buddy you seriously need to apply yourself...get an HTML book for dummies-highly recommended in your case.As for the book, correct it is an abbreviated version designed for 1 thing to pass the exams...look CompTIA will never make you a network admin or an engineer it just gives you the foundation. This book will get the job done-period."
2,Very short on useful information,"I bought this book as a study guide for taking the Network + exam, and as far as concepts goes, there's nothing in the book I would consider wrong. However, it's very short on useful specifics that will help you pass the test. I read the book from cover to cover and studied very hard, but it was sorely lacking in information on ISDN, WEP, CHAP, MS-CHAP, Tunneling Protocols and just about the whole section with regards to security which is a part of the current test. Don't buy this book by itself if you're studying for the test--unless you're just looking for a quick refresher.By the way, it contained almost no information about Fibre Optics, their connectors, distance lengths, which are all a part of the current exam."
4,Gets the job done!,"This book has lots of helpful information about the Network+ exam,however, the book does not cover in detail the true scenario's in a network environment. There were also objectives not covered on the exam that caught me off guard. Someone with at least one year experience could pass the Network+ exam with this book as I did. I guess for the money I would say this is a good study guide for the Network+ exam."
3,Title is quite deceiving!,"The title of this book, ""MCSE 2000 JumpStart"" is quite deceiving, because it will not help you to study for the MCSE.First of all, it has very minimal information even on Windows 2000. Most of the information is on general networking and PC components, which you should probably already know if you are planning on studying for the MCSE.The reason why I did not give it a lower score though, is because it did contain some interesting tidbits of information (not practical, but just interesting).Buy it if you are just interested in computer and network technology in general but do not want to get too involved. Do not buy it if you are planning to use this to assist in your studies for the MCSE."
3,Widest 'Medium' width boots/shoes I have ever put on,The boots are probably good boots - but if your foot leans at all towards narrow... I do not recommend these boots. It took three pairs of socks and an extra insole to fill the boot. I even checked several times to be sure I didn't get a mens &/or a wide width. All markings read Womens and Medium width. I had to return them.
4,How did this go unnoticed?,"The Woods...what to say about the Woods...In a word? Underated. This artist is honest and incredible. This second and latest album provides a great variety of sounds, but all with a taste of the lead singer's signature layered and laidback voice. My favorites are the slower, more melodic tracks, including Wasted and Break It Down to conclude the album. Another highlight is the cutsy, catchy song Crazy. It features many overlayed tracks of lazy guitars which give it an almost Southern, island-esque flavor.This is a great album, and well worth the money. I wish I could here more from these guys, but unfortunately they are so unknown that I can't find much else on them outside of these two albums on Amazon. Thank you Amazon!Buy this today!"
3,God's Awesome Acts Workbook,"This workbook was made with lot's of time and effort. We didn't use all of the pages, but I appreciated the ones we did use."
4,This show is amazing and my favorite!,"This is an amazing show! Normally I don't go for doctor and hospital shows because they freak me out but this show is amazing. It has all the medical doctor stuff but it also has great relationships between the characters that make the show what it is. The chemistry between some the cast members is amazing, its like they have this unbreakable relationship, nothing can come between them. This show also is really good because when someone goes into a coma or dies you get to then learn their thoughts and feelings. That makes you so enticed with the show. Also how there are ups and downs and everyday or episode the characters learn something new or take a leap into something. To sum up this, the show is amazing because of all the challenges, relationships, and just the story of it all."
5,Cancelled????,"Like many other shows on TV without a laugh track, this show was cancelled. NBC did not have the intestinal fortitude to give it a fair chance. They stopped broadcasting it with two unaired episodes remaining. They had no regard for loyal viewers who could not learn the plight of the characters they were asked to identify with.Thankfully Amazon had the final episodes available. Perhaps the fact that the show actually inspired the viewer to think was asking too much. Luckily we still have PBS where quality programming abounds.I tried calling NBC, and they do not even care enough about their viewers to have a live person answer. Instead, you are provided the opportunity to leave your opinion on a recorded line."
1,Avoid Like the Plague,"I have used Cobra Microtalk 3's for years and I was thrilled to see a higher-powered option. I purchsed two sets of these radios for use outdoors (4 total). As I was trying them out, I found that they were unreliable. I would call with one radio and only two of the others would receive. I would try again and only one would receive. I had one radio that would not transmit under ANY circumstances. I never got all four to work together at the same time. I returned one pack hoping I had a bad set, The new set gave the same response. I thought the price was awefully good. It turns out it was too good to be true. Invest in a better radio and you'll be happier. I ended up taking mine back and trading up."
5,Good quality!,"Good quality with some good brass components. Elevated sprinkler allows for nice even large area of spray. Easy to hook up. A couple plastic screw on cap parts may be an issue if roughly used, supervision around small children, not a child friendly sprinkler for running through. As good as the rest was built, the plastic caps will hopefully be upgraded to metal with a rubber o-ring."
5,A Must read for those interested in hawaiian ancient history,"Mr. Cordy does an excellent job of providing an overview of the history of the island of Hawaii. He does this will a rich blend of written and oral historical, and archaeological data. I especially enjoyed the way that the author compared and contrasted various reported historical accounts to leave the reader with the most likely version of what actually happened. The background information on climatic and agricultural characteristics of the island provided much insight into the historical information.I only wish I had read the book prior to visiting Hawaii, rather than once I returned, as it provides historical significance to the famous as well as not-so-well-known places on the Big Island.Reading this book made me want to find and enroll in the next archaeology dig on the Big Island."
3,"acceptable, but rather mediocre construction","After a few weeks of use, I can't say that I've experienced any of the problems experienced by other reviewers. However, seeing and feeling the quality of this charger, I'm guessing that it may be only a matter of time before it breaks. I have a much sturdier car charger for my Motorola RAZR, but I paid more thant double the price. Unfortunately I did not have the time to visit a store and physically inspect different chargers this time. You may be rolling the dice if you go with this charger. If you have time to go to an electronics store, I'd recommend physically inspecting the charger. It may cost a little more, but will potentially save you time, effort, and money in having to replace a flimsy charger."
1,The charger never works!,"I don't normally post reviews, but this thing really is useless. I could never get it to charge my Treo and so it was a big waste of money."
3,It's worth the price.,"This is the only place I could find this product for my late model phone. It works fine, but sometimes it requires you to jiggle it around in the socket in order to get it too. It acts like it is too loose. However, for the price I paid I don't mind. It charges great and I use it all the time. It was cheap and that's what I was looking for."
2,Vehicle Power Charger for palmOne Treo 650,I received the charge in a timely manner but just after the warranty period it stopped working and I am very diappointed.
2,Does not stay plugged into Treo 650,I've had the same experience as posted previously by others: the plug does not stay connected to the Treo so after a few seconds it stops charging until I reposition it. And the cycle continues everytime the power adapter is jostled in the slightest.
1,Item falling apart after 2nd use,Device is literally falling apart as I use it. The device will not stay plugged into my Treo unless I position the treo and charger propped up against something in the car. The part where the charger connects to the phone easily comes apart and needs to be snapped back together and even where it connects to the accessory power outlet it wants to split apart at the seams.Since this was bought from a 3rd party seller I'm wondering if I was given a knock-off brand since I did not see Palm anywhere on the packaging. I figured that the picture was outdated and now think I DID just get a cheap charger made by a cheap competitor.
1,Shoddy Workmanship,"This unit broke apart the first time I inserted it into the car's lighter plug. It is still barely operating, but who knows for how long? Also, the cord is too short and taut to use the phone while it is plugged in, and as other reviewers have said, the cord frequently falls out of the phone. I strongly recommend avoiding this prouct and buying one of the many alternatives that exist."
2,Barely Adequate,"if you simply need a charger, this works fine. I used it with two different 650's without a problem. The issue for me is that the coils of the cord are so tightly wound, that it's virtually impossible to use the phone without unplugging it. It's advertised to stretch from 2 feet to 6 feet; you'll be lucky to get it to 3 feet."
2,Not the real deal,"Note that this is NOT an official Palm product. Perhaps other people received original Palm packaging, but I got a third-party knock off. Given that the product was advertised as ""by Palm,"" this is incorrect."
5,"Car Charger for Palm devices, including Centro","Perfect! Having been through a couple of Tungstens before moving to the Centro, I can vouch that they use the same chargers. didn't need a car charger till I moved to the combined PDA and Phone. This one works fine and was the best price I found for one. Quick delivery. I leave it in the car just in case an intense day takes the charge too low. --Roj"
4,neat-o,"Works great, actually came as a Verizon charger, which only carries Blackberry but this is a Palm Cento, anyway, it works just wonderfully."
4,Works good,I had this charger for a while now. It works good and it charges fast. I bought this when it was $6. It started to get unplugged from my phone. I remember dropping my phone and it caused a crack in the bottom part where you plug this charger. My sister has the same phone and tried it on hers and it stayed plugged in. Make sure you check the connector on your phone. Sprint replaced my phone so I am not having problems with the charger anymore.
5,CAT6 cable,"Well made quality product. I have an issue that I CAN'T run cable through a wall, so used it to extend high speed downstairs. I have been using for bout 6 months and not one complaint."
3,"Why, Klaus, why?","The value of this book is the same as any memoir. Mr. Haberlen tells his story and in so doing gives us a valuable glimpse into the mindset of a German military man during World War II. Unfortunately, Klaus is the Teutonic version of an Unreconstructed Southerner, at one point opining that Hitler was really no worse than FDR. Yes, it is an interesting book, but you must beware that several disturbing conclusions such as the one just mentioned are scattered about the book. What is truly good about the book is too often obscured by the sick feeling the worst of it gives you."
1,Beyond the Occult,This book should have been a hard back and it isn't! I will be returning it as the order was incorrect!
2,Good for a nap!,The good: 4 Proven strategies suitable for budding fund managers and long term investors.The bad: The strategies are nothing new and are poorly explained leaving the viewer with more questions than answers. These took about 20 minutes to explain and the rest of the seminar is Nelson waxing lyrical. He even apologises for the seminars lack of format as he'd rushed it together the night before.
1,Disappointing junk science.,"I truly believe in the power of the mind. In so much as we can control our own thoughts we have tremendous control over our own moods and lives and can consequently impact the lives of those around us, but on a psychological level only. The authors' attempt to link the power of thought beyond our own bodies through actual physical phenomenon, like vibration, is unscholarly at best.The authors backup their claims with citations of the work of other ""scientists"", but a little investigation shows that they are simply backing up junk science with more junk science. The reference to work of Dr. Masaru Emoto's with ice crystals, for example, not only has no bearing on their subject matter, but has been discredited for its lack of scientific rigor.Had the authors stayed in the psychological realm and not ventured into the physical sciences they might have maintained their creditability and produced a truly interesting piece of work. Unfortunately they did not."
2,Best to wait For a Remix,"I couldnt wait for a new Stacey cd,and when one comes out its this.I was so disapointed! There are a couple of catchy songs but the rest are really bad.Sounds as if it was recorded in someones basement.Bad production is what ruins this whole cd.I heard there was a remix of this cd coming.I hope its true and is dance.The songs would sound better if they were more upbeat.Stay with dance Stacey.This cd was a nice try,but i hope she has learned her lesson."
5,Great new sound,"This CD was a surprise for me, more so when i discovered it in 1998. i hadn't even known she had a new cd out. All the songs are really great, and show how she has really grown as an artost. But, mostly that she can can really sing.Tenderness and Tara are my personal favorites, but the whole album is boss."
5,Dreamy,"I am most pleased by this CD. It has been heard by few and needs a spotlight quick! This really showcases Stacy Swain the artist. I list this in the ""3 cd's taken to a desert island""(Boy George-You can never be too straight and Sparks-Little Beetoven being the other 2). The obscure and alternative upstart as a techno pop performance artist are remembered here. But this time she brought along some sentiment and atmosphere. Beautiful and avant garde and still just pop music. I lurve this record made almost 10 years ago. This forgotten cd is worth remembering."
5,The greatest thing ever,"Stacey Q has done it again! After her masterworks, Better Than Heaven and Nights Like These, she has finally reached what most would agree to be her peak. I personally think that she tops George Harrison ten-fold with her stunning rendition of the (now-timeless) classic ""My Sweet Lord"". This stands up there with Blonde on Blonde as one of the definitive American musical statements. Go buy 50 copies you brainwashed bastards."
1,THIS IS THE WORST YET.,"Stacey Q needs to give it up honey! I say retire, this album should of never been made. Despite her career had 1 hit, who in their right mind - the executive at the record company thought this mindless piece of trash could make a comeback 10+ years later after having one Top Ten single. He or she should be fired! This album is just an absolute travesty of errors. The production is awful, music outdated, and Staceys voice sounds like Minnie Mouse meets the Chipmunks. A W F U L!"
3,"Not the ""usual""","This video is unlike any others. Joe doesn't go through all of the ""routine"" pieces as in other shows. There isn't ""mail time"". The clues are animated and actually sing and talk. Joe doesn't actually ""draw"" these clues. The second video is ""numbers everywhere"" and it is really more of a high level preschool show. The counting is up to 100. My child was turned off without all of the traditional ""blue's clues"" events."
5,Fun to watch whether you're a kid or a parent,This was our first Blue's Clues video for our three year old and she loves it. It's easy to follow and fun to watch. I even find myself singing the little songs they have in it. It's one of the few videos she has where she actually interacts with the program.The version we have actually has two episodes and both are a little under 30 minutes.
5,Like a workshop in book form,"Years ago we attended one of Christan's workshops when she was in California. There was so much of Christan's wisdom to learn, digest and understand. We all benefited so much from doing the space clearings on our own homes that Christan taught in her workshop.I'm so glad that Christan has now put her wisdom into book form so that others can benefit from it as well who cannot attend a personal training."
4,Space Clearing Kit,"I bought this book to use for teaching Clutter Clearing with feng shui and it is a good book but doesn't have a lot to do with feng shui. I like to offer students a variety of resources and this book was definitely different from the other space clearing books on the market. As such, it was very worth while. If you are looking for space clearing ideas to connect you to Mother Earth, this is the book for you. I will use it again and am glad it is available."
5,Simple,"This books a new way in which to purify and energetically cleanse your home based on ancient wisdom and modern scientific discoveries. This is not your traditional book on feng shui, it does not have the traditional difficulty of application, even a beginner could do this.Space clearing also helps to detect geopathic stress zones that could be affecting your psychological, physical, and spiritual well being."
2,A Corny Elixir,"Nov 19th 2009...just finished watching this on my 100"" screen....the visual quality is so poor that I had to zoom into a smaller screen size (50"") to make it bearable. Pavarotti acts like a 5th grader, but sings superbly, but Bruscantini and Blegen are both effortful in their coloratura, and his aging voice lacks a clear centre to the notes....a charming but woolly performance. The sound is so low I had to set my amp's volume way beyond any setting I have ever used before. Approach this issue with caution....only for small screen viewers who adore Pavarotti."
3,3 stars,"If you are new to Christianity, this book provides a simple overview of the Bible, summarizing each book and providing brief biographical sketches of key figures. Major events and concepts are concisely explained. Those familiar with these things already can benefit from the passages that concern details of daily life, and perhaps refresh their minds on things they already know.Amanda Killgore"
3,"F.Y.I. - Same movie as ""The Virgin Of Nuremerg""!!!","""Horror Castle"", a.k.a. ""The Virgin Of Nuremerg""!!! The latter version can go for almost $10 more. I've never had the chance to compare quality between them but I own the ""Virgin"" release and it looks great ~"
3,Horror Castle Review,"OK movie. Not great. If you collect Horror Castle movies, this would be a reason to buy this movie. It is Italian, so you automatically figure LOW BUDGET. It is dubbed in English."
2,"Heavy on ASP, light on Visual Studio","Before there was ASP.NET, there was ASP. This book is clearly a ""Teach Yourself ASP"" book that has had the "".NET"" moniker added to the title. All the code examples show embedded code withing ASP pages rather than the newer (and clearly superior) ""code behind"" model of Microsoft's Visual Studio product. I am most disappointed that there are no explanations of how to use the Visual Studio environment to build the web pages. The authors seem to be of the ""I've got notepad to enter my code and that's all I need"" school of programming. To be honest, the title did not say anything about Visual Studio, so I guess the joke's on me."
2,Book is more about old ASP than ASP.net,"The authors has not spend enough time to write the book in a manner so that the readers can get the feel of the subject. It absolutly not going for new ""code behind"" technology. If you want to study ASP it is a so so book but if you are planning to take advantage of ASP.net and C# look else where. Authors could have made project examples in visual studio.net and gave us instead of single file format. In short it doesn't teach you C# or .Net or ASP.net."
4,A book for .NET without electric code is funny,"The book's writing skills and organization is good. But unfortunately, I cannot get any electric source code from anywhere. The book was definitely written before the Microsoft Visual Studio .NET release. Without electric source code, you have to type in all of the code to find out if the code works or not. At first, I consider to use the book as text book in my class, but I have to choose another one which have electric code source even I like this book better. I hope the author can provide electric code in the future; I 'd like to use it for my next class if I can get the updating electric code for this book."
2,Boring,Bough books 1-3 in this series for my nine year old son because he loves hockey and not reading. Even the hockey in the story couldn't keep him interested in reading
4,Very cute but a little larger than expected.,I bought this for my daughter's princess birthday and used it for sandwiches but I needed to buy bread that was wide instead of tall.
3,I wish it was a better quality metal,It started to rust after the first wash. I have other metal cookie cutters that are of better quality metal. I was dissapointed.
2,Cookie cutter crown,"Don't make peanut butter and jelly sandwich crowns with it: it hurts to push down on the sharp edges, the crown gets stuck to the food, and after you pry it off, it really doesn't even look like a crown. Great idea though if I could just figure out how to bypass these things."
1,The worse of all GPS',"I've just bought this gps , and I'm gonna tell you I'm totally dissapointed with this unit.At the same time my father bought a Garmin eTrex unit and it's much better. I now regret all the fun I've made about his GPS and mine because mine has 18 satellite connection and his just 12. Fisrt of all the Garmin connects in about 45 second while the Cobra in 2 minutes.Meanwhile the Garmin gets 9 sats the Cobra only gets 5. Now I'm working with UTM coordinates and the Garmin shows me all the info I need while the Cobra doesn't.The unit handling is friendly user for the Garmin while the Cobra doesn't.An overall qualification 0 out of 10."
1,One Star is Too Good a Rating!,"Repeating the sentiment of the earlier reviews? Yes, I am. Important to do so? I'd say, yes, it is, since you might think the other three reviewers were just unlucky.The Cobra 500 is absolutely useless. It locks onto the required 3 satellites ... sometimes. Usually not. But when it does lock on, it loses them within a couple of minutes. On the other hand, when you look at all the features listed in their literature and compare it to the modest price, you think it's too good to be true. Unfortunately, it is. Truly a P.O.S."
1,Cobra gps500 a toy,"Recently upgraded a cobra 100 for a 500... first time out, it failed, leaving me in the woods all night 'till I got a bearing on the sun in AM... When they say take a compass with you, they mean use your compass and leave the gps in the car!!!The unit looks nice, and works well enough as long as there are no trees, clouds or perhaps birds flying above you.It's great as a childs toy, or to find the parking lot where you left your car (but not the car itself) $5.00 for a compass and twenty cases of beer, or a gps500, for about the same price... It's your choice!!!"
1,Too Good To BE True...it Ain't,"The bargain GPS I got seemed to work fine on the trip home from town, except the build in maps only list major roads.I spent the money on the interface cables, power cable and mapping CD roms only to discover that the 500 will not allow map detail information like roads to be uploaded! What then is the point? I wanted to be able to download the routes and use them with maps. The software is horrible compared to Microsoft or Delorme.Save your money.By a GPS package for your laptop or get a middle priced Garmin or Magellan! I understand why I got it so cheap. I got what I paid for. Just wish I hadn't spend money on the accessories!"
1,This thing is really as bad as all the other reviews say it is,"I purchased a GPS500 for geocaching, mainly attracted by the low price and ""FAST"" acquistion feature. Screen resolution is terrible, acquisition times vary from 6 minutes to never, accuracy (compared to friends' GPS units) was way off, and it proved to be utterly unreliable in the field. I returned mine 10 days after I bought it and got a Garmin eTrex Legend. I am now quite pleased."
1,One star is still to high!!!!,"I was lost in the woods, due to the Cobra500, since it is unable to lock on any satalites, when a skunk tried to attack me. I threw my Cobra500 Gps at it, sending the skunk away. And it worked. Maybe this GPS is just a skunk defender tool of some sort. Because as a GPS it is really skunky. Seriously, This product should have never been sold to the public. It is faulty in all aspects. Stay away!! Buy the Etrex"
1,The Worst Ever,My parents got this for me and it does not function at all. It is completely worthless. I spent many frustrated hours trying to get it to work. I'm sure it took a few years off my life.
5,The Secret's Out,"It seems pretty daring to attempt ""a novel in verse"" for young adults---how many of them read poetry?---but Meg Kearney brings so much passion, narrative skill, technical ability, and insider's insight to this wonderful little book that kids (and adults) will love it. There's a very engrossing story here, told in a novel way. Make that a poetic way. I have friends and relatives who were adopted, and I never felt such understanding and empathy for them as I did after reading this book. I hope ""The Secret of Me"" gets the attention it deserves."
4,The Secret Of Me,The Secret of me is a good book that is based on a kid that is adopted. When you start to read this book you wont be able to put it down because its so good. But the best part about this book is the format becasue it is poetry. The Secret of me is a book that all of you should and see what is it like to be adopted.
1,NOT EVEN CLOSE!!!,"The package claims the pens write smoothly, on wet surfaces and even upside down. It does none of these (I bought a 3 pack and tried them all). The ink skips terribly and it feels as though the pen is scatching the paper. If you want a pen that WILL do everything this pen CLAIMS it can do, get the Fisher Space pen. For a relatively cheap disposable pen that writes extremely smooth at any angle get the Syntech Focus Fying Colors ball point pen."
4,Inflated DVD,"NOT crisp and clear as stated on the DVD, but Kirk still shines...His rapport with great Spanish pianist Tete Montoliu is a blast (they're both blind, which makes non-verbal communication a bit complicated) but, in spite of shoddy, substandard picture and slightly muffled sound (even on my ordinary TV-set),it's a riot to watch and listen to Kirk perform! Even on this worn-out-VHS-quality DVD.So, I'm giving it 4 stars, just for the content, but if you have some high quality equipment you might want to avoid this one.BTW - the first concert boasts, in addition to Tete on piano, Tommy Potter on bass and Kenny Clarke on drums;the second set is a bit weaker (the rest of the musicians are not such legends),although the same numbers sound mighty fine on the album they recorded soon after:Inflated Tear"
3,"Kirk is great, production not.",It is a patchwork. Video quality is bad. This DVD give you only spurious IMPRO-JAZZ logo on TV screen to irritate jazz fans.For all - it is great to see R.R.Kirk in action. If you are Kirk's fan -buy it. This will be out of stock soon.Recommendation: Jazz Icons presents own Roland Kirk's DVD on September 2008. I guess in great quality.
4,works just fine,"I found out about the barely works in the irish section of the Rough Guide to World Music, a very nice resource specializing in the el gondo. I guessed that their sound would not be completely traditional since tha band is led by a banjo player and includes a tuba (I find that I rarely dislike a record with a tuba on it, personal quirk I guess). But I did not realize how much fun the Barely Works music would be. They cover a lot of ground, from originals to cover of old traditional tunes, ""old Joe Clark"", but a sense of humor is a key ingredient for all their songs. The musicianship is excellent ( I've got a crush on the fiddle player), and I love records that introduce different elements into a musical stew that tastes like something completely different. Reccomended if you like Richard Thompson and the Albion Band."
4,Not for use with stick blenders,"Diameter of this beaker is too small for a Cuisinart stick blender to make it to the bottom, so look elsewhere if stick blending is what you wish to use it for. Otherwise, good measuring device."
3,GIFT,"I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY SON AND HIS GIRLFRIENDS KITCHEN AND THEY LIKED IT . I THOUGHT IT WAS GLASS , BUT THAT IS OK . I THINK GLASS WOULD HAVE BEEN COOLER . THEY LIKED IT AND THAT IS ALL THAT MATTERS."
4,Works as designed,Works as designed. All tested and none dry. Love the orange color because it stands out better than the typical highlighter and doesn't make it difficult to read like the darker colors.
3,Alpaca wool poncho?,Although this product is nice and soft it is not 100% wool50 Alpacha wool and 50% Acrylic.Just be aware of this! and it took longer than 10 days to receive this product.
1,"Offensive, Yes. - Funny, No.","This item was recommended by Amazon for those who were also interested in the irish comedian Hal Roach. (Hal Roach was an Irish comedian whose material is dated but funny, and is clean and very family friendly). I figured this dvd (Cream of Irish Comedy) would be comparable.I found much of the language higly offensive and other material very irreverent. The ""F"" word is used throughout, and is heavily used in a 'Saprano's-like' skit of the Last Supper.-Bottom line, I wouldn't take this dvd if you gave it away."
2,Not funny...,Bought this for my husband who finds British humor so hilarious. This he did not. Thumbs down.
5,The Best Cookware for Home Chefs,"I work professionaly in the Food & Beverage sector. I am used to professional quality products at work and like the same at home.Anolon Professional cooks evenly and is a breeze to clean. With this most recent purchase, I now have over 30 pieces.It is not dishwasher safe, but do not let that be a deterent. The pots and pans clean up with soap and warm water . . . no elbow grease is needed."
1,No subtitles? No closed captions? Too bad,No subtitles? No closed captions? Too bad. Once again the makers choose to ignore the 30 million Americans who are hearing impaired.
1,Excellent movies,"John Hannah is one of the best actors in English moviesI bought the 2nd season alsoa five star raringthis was a great series do not know why they didn't continue itchfancier""fancierof fine movies"""
5,Things I didn't know I could learn,"This book exceeded my expectations. It is written in that clear way that helps you to understand processes that are after all, usually pretty hard to understand. The many sidebars of tips are especially helpful and reading it made me want to try out some of the new stuff mentioned."
3,So-so!,"I cannot understand how anyone would say this book is so good. True, it has the breezy writing style typical of a Missing Manual type work, but, frankly, I did not see all of the secret ""inside"" information said to be present here. It's a nice book, but that's all. Some of the other Office 2001 works are more comprehensive."
4,A keeper,"I thoroughly enjoyed Georgie and Angolos story. It's a tale of miscommunication and miscalculation. Basically they fall in love fast and neither believes in the love of the other - Georgie has good reason, since Angolos throws her out when she tells him she's pregnant. The dialogue between the two is engaging, and the story moves quickly. I've reread this one my kindle several times."
5,A JOYRIDE INTO THE WORLD OF NU SKOOL BREAKS !!!,This Cd makes it clear: Nu Skool Breaks are not just dark and dirty. This Cd is a very well balanced between more upbeat funky tunes and some darker more serious stuff. At no times is this Mix is cheesy tough. Even if you are not into Nu Skool Breaks this one might change your mind. Most Nu Skool mixes are way to hard and dark and most funky breaks cds just plain cheese but there are always exceptions to the rule. See Icey's - Essential Elements.Adam Freeland has put live recordings of the screaming crowd into the mix which adds a really great stadium feel to this CD.The mixing is tight and the atmosphere great.Tayos - Y4k was last years nu skool winner and this year Adam takes the price.
4,Works great.,"As always another quality product from Sandisk.This drive is sturdy and durable, it withstands abuse and keeps working, my previous drive (plastic) broke at the keyring connector. The only downside is that in my tests, this drive is a tiny bit slower than the cruzer micro. As for the U3 technology, I do not use it, [...]"
4,Nice Flash Drive,"I have been pleased with the Flash Drive. It is a nice compact cost-effective data store device. The only draw back is the U3 technology, while kind of cool, can be a little annoying when trying to use the drive simply for data storage and transition."
4,Well Made Thumb Drive,"This Thumb Drive is a little gem, but the U3 software that comes with it should be made optional to non-technical users. For me, I cannot use the TD with its software because of security issues imposed by what I do. Trying to delete the software from the drive, non-techies will find that it replicates upon reconnecting the TD. To clean the drive, you can use the U3 removal software that is available online by doing a search for U3 removal software... or better yet just format the sucker! If you work in a highly secure environment. After you do this... the TD is SUPER! However you may want to save your U3 software on your personal computer before your zap it! The best thing I like about this TD, is there is no cap to lose, and it comes with a secure carrying system. Both Pocket Clip and Necklace system. I only wish this design would be available in an 8-16 GB version."
5,Extremely well made,"This product only reinforces the earlier versions of itself with the 1 and 2 gig versions. I feel it is even better well made than the 2 gig version. The quality is better than what I could of asked, and now with 4 gigs make life even easier."
2,U3 Driver is Not Compatible with Vista,"The U3 driver preinstalled on this USB drive is not compatible with Windows Vista. (Vista does not recognize it as a valid disk drive). As of the date of this review, SanDisk hasn't any Vista U3 driver for this yet. With Windows XP, it works just great. I like this drive for the password protection capability of all my data. If not for Vista compatibility, would give it a 4 star rating.Note: I was able to get this drive to work with Vista, but I had to disable the U3 Security and U3 Autostart (from an XP machine first) in order to get Vista to recognize the data on this drive."
3,No Vista Support,"The U3 software for the drive doesn't work under vista. Their newer drives do work with vista, which is why I'm at a total loss why they can't update this device. I sent email to their tech support, and they've taken over two weeks to send me a broken link that supposedly has my answer in it.As a drive, it works fine, but the total package is lacking because it doesn't deliver what is promised: It advertises itself as a Flash Drive with U3. They neglect to mention that if you have a new computer, U3 doesn't work."
1,Metal casing causes electrostatic discharges - your data is zapped!,"No-one seems to have mentioned a major flaw with the Cruzer Titanium. The (admittedly very stylish) metal casing can cause electrostatic discharges. This usually occurs just as you are about to insert the drive into your computer. If this happens, not only will all data on the drive be zapped, the drive will become completely unusable.It's a shame: the drive looks great and I hate putting my data on the flimsy plastic alternatives, but once you've been zapped, you'll never by a Titanium again."
4,"Good, but not great.","Obviously a review of the storage is not needed, so I will point out the issues I had with mine:1) Advertised to be extra durable, even with very light usage over the course of a few months the USB connector started to loosen to the point that for a data connection to be created I had to wiggle the USB key until the circuit was completed.2) The U3 software, while a great idea, most of the time these applications are needed it is on a computer other than your own. As we all know, friend's laptops and computer labs are usually not state-of-the-art and this software can spend minutes loading before you have access to your data. I did remove the software, but to remove it completely you need to download a tool from SanDisk website, which is more of a hassle than it should have been."
2,Sandisk 4 gig,"I bought the sandisk Titanium while I was in Iraq, it was great. It did everything I neede and then some. I used the U3 site and downloaded lots of cool things. I never got to use them however because the disk fried after about 4 months. a tech told me to go to the site and try to redownload the software as it was corrupt, but I haven't been able to find out how yet, no info on it. Bottom line is the stick was great but it does not last."
4,SanDisk 4GB Cruzer - great buy,The product is an excellent product that fit the need that I had very well. The seller had a great price and sent the product quickly.
4,Good drive,"Strong, affordable, convenient. Only thing I would say is that it is not the nice titanium looking device pictured here, but is some type of metal that has a cheap chromed look to it. Whatever. It works."
5,the best - must have this!,A must have for secure data backup. Synch software is included so your laptop and flash drive will always contain the exact same files you selected for backup. My dog chomped on a plastic flash drive I had but can't chew this one! Pick up a lanyard to go with it so you don't lose it.The 2 gig ones make perfect Christmas gifts.
1,Haven't received this item,"The seller said they delivered this item, but I haven't received it by now, and I think I won't forever. I won't buy anything from this seller again."
1,sandisk 4 gb flashdrive,I can not comment on this product as far 12/25/2007 have not received it in my home
5,Review of Sandisk 4GB Titanium,"In my opinion this is the flash drive that has given me the best cost/benefit ratio. Additionaly it has many attributes worth mentioning: (1) It is fast. (2) It is secure (password protection very important) and safe to use. (3) It has a beautiful design. (4) It has a big signaling light. (5) It is very strong, from every point of view (6) Good and useful software included.Oscar A. Römer"
5,"Nice Durable USB, but U3 is a waste.","We bought five of these for our engineers to use for backing up and transporting files. The construction and durability seem great, but we all have agreed that the U3 application is very gimmicky and not very useful for real world business users until some mainstream software companies get on board. They have a nice utility to remove it to free up more memory on the drive."
4,Residual U3 bother,"As far as price, storage, form factor, and non-brokenness go, I'm very happy with this so far. It is, however, quite annoying that whenever I plug it in, it auto-mounts a read-only ""U3 System"" drive, as well as the USB storage. I've so far failed to find a way to get rid of that thing which, since I'm not running a Microsoft system, isn't at all useful."
5,Who needs a laptop when you have this!,"Wow I love this Tool/Toy. I love the U3 Portable Apps. I can put Open Office, Trillian, Music Pictures, Fire Fox and use it on anys ystem.Computers with locked down block many privileges but this tool opens back up the tools... not to mention having all your stuff portable and working on pretty much any computer. Take it to school, library, work and home and never leave behind the important stuff... not to mention it is only a few onces of weight and fits into a pocket... try to do that with a laptop!"
4,4GB is big enough,I have found the 4GB Cruzer Titanium is big enough for all the applications and browser I need while traveling. This USB Drive with U3 makes it easy to menu up all your needed functions. I think this is a great value for the money.
4,Flash Memory Stick,The only comment i have to make about the Cruzer 4 gig memory is that it comes with a bunch of programs that I can't erase. Every time i erase them they come right back and take up space. Some kind of U3 that's used for something or other that I don't use and probably never will. Other than that I got it just as i expected.
2,"Nice, but static will destroy this drive","Nice drive - but the same metal that makes it durable also is it's Achilles heel. Mine lasted about a year until a couple inadvertent static zaps trashed it completely. If you get this drive, be sure to touch something metal prior to inserting it into your computer, otherwise a static discharge could completely trash this drive. A real pain if you don't have a backup of the data."
3,Good Design - With One Flaw,"I know this is my own fault, but I've lost two of these drives because the key ring broke. Don't put it on your key ring, or change the keyring it comes with to a sturdier wire!"
1,Sandisk Cruzer TRASH,really sorry that I wasted my money. usually Sandisk is gr8 but not this piece of junk. too much space taken up with their propriatary system that you can't even format off of there. Very irritating mem device. I simply threw it away.
1,"rugged shell, weak guts",Like a turtle it's invulnerable as long as the head is retracted. But the USB prong cracked right off after a month of use... and not hard use. Junk. And is loaded with some of the more annoying software too...
3,It's Okay,"It's pretty fast (faster than my old one, anyway), and has a cool blue light. It looks to be pretty durable, although I haven't had it that long.Not too thrilled about the U3 stuff. I didn't purchase it fot that purpose. It gives you an extra drive letter, which shows up as a CD drive. It's not so easy to remove if you're not familiar with it.Also, the mechanism for keeping the USB connector extended is kind of flimsy. When you pop it open, you need to double-check to make sure it locked in place."
4,Works Fine,"I was a little worried after reading reviews about annoying software installation. Although, when you first use the drive there is a request to install and restart your computer...you don't have to! I would recommend this drive. Be aware that you must eject the drive by clicking on a special ""U3"" icon which is different from most drives. If you don't, the next time you insert the drive into a computer it will warn you about improperly removing the drive. Again despite the quirks not a bad drive."
5,Just awesome,"What can I say? Its liquid metal shell is absolutely indestructible and nearly scratch-proof, the drive itself is both fast and roomy, and 2 months into ownership, the retracting USB connector seems to hold as well as it did the first day. A fantastically engineered piece of convenience!"
1,Dangerous device...you can get burned LITERALLY!,"I just tried to use the new device and on 1st plug in it worked fine. I chose not to autolaunch the U3 program and tried to copy data to it...NOTHING HAPPENED. Unplugged device, reboot system and now it does not even come up AND the drive is VERY HOT TO TOUCH. I am not going to take a chance on injuring myself. I have learned my lesson on buying a FLASHY looking drive. It is not worth it..."
3,Not as good as shown on the image,The metal shell is actually crappily thin and comes in two pieces. It's shining appearance fades out after 2 days and you can see lots of scratches.The structure is nice. But the crappy shell makes it no better than the Cruzer Micro.
5,Satisfied Customer,"This is AMAZING. I have transferred over 500 pictures and numerous documents...and its all portable. I love it. I take it to work with me and on vacation with me. Its titanium so its practically indestructible. I LOVE it. I should have purchased one long ago, but I'm glad I waited for this one."
4,3 years using this device (SanDisk Cruzer Titanium 4 GB USB 2.0 Flash Drive) without any problem,"I bought this flash almost from 3 years and i am still using it on daily basis at work without any problem, format it many times and dropped from me several time and if I will by new one of course looking for 16 GB sure will be this model. given 4 because it is heavy and to upgrade U3 program you have to format it."
3,Something to consider,"This is a good general use thumb drive, but just understand that if your intention is to use this as a bootable USB drive then I'll save you the headache and tell you that it just doesn't work. I used Unetbootin and HP's software in all the file formats. It must be the proprietary software that they put on it that mucks things up."
3,4GB seems small,"The design of this device is excellent and the durability is also impressive. 4GB seems small now, since my phone has over 8GB and even that doesn't seem to be that much."
2,hard to plug in,"bought this brand because i wanted to run u3 software. the usb plug in for this unit retracts into the base (like lipstick). unfortunately, it is difficult to plug in to a usb port, because pushing it in makes it retract. it is difficult / awkward to hold a slider that controls this movement and plug in at the same time. a pain in the a@@. poor design...why put up with the hassle every time you want to ""plug in""?"
3,USB connector is VERY tight,"I had so much trouble connecting this to my computer that I sent the first one back and got a replacement. Unfortunately, this one's just as difficult to connect! I tested on 4 different USB ports and have to fight to insert it every time. I have *lots* of computer experience, so that wasn't the issue. BTW, Amazon was great about taking the first one back.Once connected, it works well. Good speed, U3 software works fine and doesn't take up much room.The retractable USB connector is cool, though I think a real cap would protect it better. It just retracts into the body, but you could still get pocket lint, sand, etc inside the connector. This thing has enough trouble plugging in, so I'd guess that the extra problems from you'd get from grit would make it unusable."
3,It blew out my USB port.,Apparently this thing requires a lot of power because it literally blew out my USB port.
2,Broke after 2 Attempts!,"I have a Cruzer 1 Gig drive and it has served its purpose well. After two uses on this one, it went capoot. I'm debating trying again. I ordered other flash drives but they don't have U3.This item was shipped from Blue Proton and after a little hagling, they gave me a refund.Maybe just my misfortune, I'm not sure."
4,flash drive,"I have no complaints. Really only bought it because it was on sale. It does what I wanted it to do, store my pictures."
1,CruzerSync software dysfunctional,"The CruzerSync is intended to synchronize your files between your main computer and the drive, but will work only in simple cases when you do not move or delete your files, and do not need to sync two computers.If your move your file to a sub-directory (in the same folder) on your main computer, it just deletes it from flash drive. Documentation is non-existent, your have to learn by trial and error.I hoped to synchronize files between my home and work computer - the software is not designed for that. Crashes every time when trying to install an update."
4,Appears to be a decent piece of equipment,"I've only had this item now for about a week. I encountered some problems with the third party distributor sending me the incorrect item initially, but all has been corrected since then. This Cruzer has plenty of available space and transfers data quick enough to keep a person from getting too impatient. I know that several reviews state a dislike for the U3 technology, but to be honest, that was one reason I went with this product. U3 provides a ""cloned"" environment of any PC you may use as your ""base"" system that can be used on any other system throughout the world. For me, that is a selling point since I travel a lot for business and now do not have to lug my laptop all over the place. I simply synchronize my Cruzer with my system, and everything I need is right on my mobile storage unit. It's like having your PC or notebook in your pocket."
5,Great product!,"Well worth the extra $$. Fully retractable port keeps dust, etc out. Titanium cover protects when dropped. Very quick read/write speeds. I'd highly recommend this product."
2,It works...,"It works but that is about all it has going for it, other than the cool blue light. The lack of support for Vista kills this product almost as much as the manufacturer's sub par support."
1,Better hav right equip,never used product bc the machine i had wasnt sufficent...not a quick fix like i was hoping ie must wait whole day for carpet to dry
1,EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED! DO NOT BUY!,"If you're reading this and considering a 600 thread count sheet set, I assume you are looking for quality. This sheet set is far from it. I thought I was making a good purchase when I ordered this, comparing it with lots of other 600 count sets, and this seemed to be the best deal for the dollar. After the second washing, the fitted sheet developed pills all over it. It became the most uncomfortable thing to sleep on and only having purchased it just a couple of months ago, I've had to get rid of it.Very disappointed."
1,Piling and split seams after only like a month...,"I bought these figuring I would risk it, that some of the issues could have been flukes...after a couple washings, and only a months use or so, there is significant piling in the sleep areas, and the seems split on the pillowcases... major crap.these might be good for a guest bed, but if you sleep on them every night... not so great."
5,Egyptian Sheets,"I ordered the set on a Thursday, I did standard shipping only & they arrived by Saturday! Product just as described, and for the price/comfort I will order additional sets for my other bedrooms!"
2,A waste of money,"They were nice the first few washings, I guess. Came out of the dryer highly wrinkled, never got soft, now faded and spotted, even though I use cold water, regular Gain and dryer sheets with dryer on low. These are the worst sheets I've ever purchased. Period."
2,Wrong sizing,"Ordered a Queen size... they arrived with 2 King size pillows, a smaller-than-Queen fitted sheet, and a King size flat sheet..."
2,Not their best.,The Chenille Sisters are such sweet fun. But not so much on this record. Darn. It's not so easy to find a good Christmas album.The hunt continues.
4,Archaeology supporting recent history and forensics,"This was the supplementary text for an intro to archaeology course I ended up dropping. Since I'll be signing up for the course again next spring, I decided to read it anyway.Feder's out-of-print book reprints relatively recent articles about unusual archaeological applications in forensics, and in reconstruction of recent history, like combatant movements during the battle of the Little Bighorn.The book gives you a general idea of more recent applications of archaeology. It's not just about dusty bones in a museum basement."
5,A great man Tales of Alaska's Bush Rat Governor,It is Hard to find great stories like this.they should make a movie out of it.A great read.Howard
3,Japanese for Dummies,I bought this book thinking it would provide me with easy to use phrases for a trip to Japan. I found it anything buy easy...it spent too much time providing grammar lessons and had very limited sections for useful phrases. I found other books more useful.
1,Disappointing,"After using this book for two weeks here is what I did NOT find: 1) when you create a JList of Vector[] objects, what is displayed in the list is what the toString method of the objects returns. I found this out for myself with no clue from the book. 2) in order to display a JProgressBar it is not enough to use the serValue method of the bar. You need to update the display with pbar.paint(pbar.getGraphics()). Again, no clue from the book. 3) to get the JProgressBar to not flicker all that is necessary is to enable the double buffering property of JProgressBar, a big code saver over the code needed to double buffer in the AWT. Again, no help from the book. The book DOES explain how to use the JProgressBar in a thread that makes the call to paint unnecessary. However, this is NOT what I wanted or needed to do."
1,yikes!!,"I can't recall a tech book so thoroughly unreadable! Maybe if I was more well versed in Swing this might make a little more sense, but seriously....it's great that these folks know all the inheritance lines and can spit them out in eight words or less, but seriously...imagine this as a classroom lecture..anybody awake? anybody still here? well, this class inherits from that or this implemements that interface, and if you look closely, you'll see how this references what we said 47 pages ago (or better yet, what we're gonna say 36 pages down the road!)...all well and good...but we're trying to write real programs and solve real problems....c'mon guys, we're not experts here, else we wouldn't be buying the book!! how about a litle real world usage...I don't have to time to check out the API docs to try and figure out what these guys are yakking about...a major disappointment."
2,Not quite what I had expected,"I bought this book expecting that the book would make a good tutorial covering all aspects of Java Swing. I found that it does not cover all aspects of Java Swing, not even including the GridBagLayout or BorderLayout Layout Managers. It does not show how JSplitPane can be used within a JSplitPane for a complex layout using JSplitPane as it has been in another book I read. The book is a boring read and does ignite the imagination of the reader to build advanced GUI's. I regret buying the book."
4,WITH FINE-TUNED IMPROVEMENTS OVER THE PREVIOUS EDITION,"This elaborated textbook showed a promising improvement over the previous edition. It is stuffed with the latest guides for creating GUIs. Readers would notice that this edition of ""Java Swing"" has included most of the newest elements of the software, while at the same time, dumping all the archaic aspects which are no longer popular.Users of 'Mac OS X' would appreciate the expanded coverage that has been given to the Operating System. There are also, revised information on cross-platform compatibility: including new illustrated examples.Still, as was the case with the previous edition, some of the examples provided in this edition need extra modification before they could be effectively applied."
3,Useless for working programmers trying to learn quick,"When you're trying to get a project in Swing up and running fast, you need a book that has a good mix of examples, theory, and then the details later. I am an experienced GUI interface programmer in other languages, but found that this book couldn't answer anything but the simplest questions, because it would get you bogged down in the internal details too soon. I may come back to this book later when I need a detailed reference, but for now, it's time to look for another book."
3,Wished it had more tutorial,"I'm forced to agree with the review below. This book should have spent less time documenting the entire text package and more time teaching us about what we can and cannot extend outside of the javax.swing.text package. For a reference its pretty good, but it borders on having material that will probably never be used."
2,Poorly formatted API with too few examples and screen shots.,"I returned this book: I already had it in the form of javadoc-generated api specs.Well, it did provide different information than the API specs, but I found it poorly organized and formatted. The bottom-up approach, as one reviewer put it, did me no good. I really would rather know what a JTable is before a JTableColumn.For the reasons stated above the book was not much use as reference material either.To the author's credit, he apparently got the book published very quickly in terms of Swing 1.1's birthday, so at one point it probably was the best Swing book around, but now you can save your money and buy another book."
1,The worst book among the books about Java Swing,"This is by far most useless book among the books about Java Swing. It does not explain the concepts well. It doesn't serve as a reference well. The example are not good either. Overall, this book makes the developers completely confused. You are not going to waste your money, nature's resource (trees for making papers for this book), and most importantly your time. Go to SUN's web site and grap the SWing tutorial and Java 2 API reference. Together they will serve you 1000 times better than this book."
3,OK not the best book on swing,"OK but there are lots of better books on swing. The *book* is Geary's Graphic Java but at 1600 pages it is more of a reference then something you'll want to read-it's just *too* big. On the other hand, I just got Zukowski's Swing book and it seems really excellent - much more manageable then Geary and more up to date then Eckstein. Of course, the best situation would be if there was a new edition of Core JFC -none of the code runs in that anymore although the changes needed aren't hard-I learned swing from that book!"
4,Pretty Thorough Reference,"Man, has Swing grown; no wonder it took 5 authors to write this book! Anyway, they do a good job describing a very complex subject. The text is definitely more of a reference than a tutorial, but if that's what you're looking for then definitely check out this book...*IF* you have another source for layout managers. Other reviewers have pointed this out as well. In my opinion, this topic deserves its own chapter because every time you put a component in a container you have to be aware of its layout manager. And when a dialog box gets complicated, as they are wont to do, you have layout managers dealing with each other ad infinitum - and that is precisely when you really need to understand how they work so you can make sense of what is going on when you resize something."
3,Not as good as advertized,The book as a whole is pleasant to read and covers wide enough range of topic. One huge glaring omission is the GridBagLayout (only mentions in passing while cover other less pwerful layout managers). What's up with that?Don't hope to get much on the section on creating a custom editor kit. The book makes no mention about how to actually create alternative document structures. The on-line chapter is no help on this matter either. I wish the book will explain how ElementSpec class is used.
4,Taking the full advantage of the Swing classes,"The Swing classes eliminate Java's biggest weakness: its relatively primitive user interface toolkit. Java Swing helps you to take full advantage of the Swing classes, providing detailed descriptions of every class and interface in the key Swing packages. It shows you how to use all of the new components, allowing you to build state-of-the-art user interfaces and giving you the context you need to understand what you're doing. It's more than documentation; Java Swing helps you develop code quickly and effectively."
5,Excellent Reference,"This is must have reference for anyone that wants to learn Java Swing. It covers almost every class in Swing, with detailed explanations of what its most important methods do, it members and constants and examples on how to use them. These examples demonstrate just how powerful and rich applications developed with Swing can be. While the author assumes that the reader has some Java and Object Oriented knowledge, this book serves as a solid reference to those who want to learn Swing either from scratch or to expand their programming skills."
2,Not the tutorial I was looking for.,This is one of the few O'Reilly books I have been disappointed with. It is pretty much just a hard copy of the API with comments. However some of the examples were quite useful. Unfortunately this book just doesn't compare to some of the other Swing books out there.
4,To much irrelevant info,"The aim of this book seems to be covering everything... There's a lot of irrelevant info for the average Swing-user (I think). And you can't just read the relevant parts, as things are intermixed. Seems like the authors aimed to write as many pages as possible rather than only the really relevant stuff..."
1,Not much more than an API listing - look elsewhere,"I had really hoped this book would help me w/Swing. I even checked out the O'Reilly online pages; my favorite Java book (Exploring Java) is also an O'Reilly book. However, this book (all 1200 pgs) is largely a dump of the API with some comments and small examples. There are many things I've tried to look up in the clueless index in the back and thru pages and pages of the text - to no avail. I am now back to using the online tutorials on the Sun site...and waiting to find a *good* Swing book! Look elsewhere!!"
1,very disappointing book,"This book have too many simple descriptions about swing APIs, so it more like a manual than a book on swing. There are neither in-depth explanations about swing nor practical hints on swing programming in this book. You can find almost half the contents of this book by reading the documentation of Java Swing. I have to say this is a useless book for programming with swing."
1,Terse style of O'Reilly fails again...,"At first, O'Reilly's Swing book seems packed with good information and useful examples. But after using it as a reference, I found the examples are pretty much useless for real-world problem-solving, or they just plain do not work. The terse style usually found in many O'Reilly books fails woefully to explain or illuminate a developer of the concepts behind Swing, which is a huge subject matter. The copy I purchased was ripped to shreds out of frustration and the sense that I got ripped off. I am now looking for Swing book that actually has information relevent to the real world instead of the interesting, but purely academic exercises presented in this book."
3,Badly organised,This book provides additional information over the Sun doc. However it is very difficult to follow due to the poorly organised.
4,No way to learn Swing,"Forget this book as ones introduction to Swing. Rely on Sun's tutorial for that. But as a reference this book describes everything, and in a much more coherent way than the Javadocs ever do. Example programs (downloadable from the Net) clarified many issues for me. Only real problem is finding where the answers are -- the book is huge and the index doesn't seem to help. All said, I haven't had a reason to buy another Swing book, and this is after a year."
3,"published in 2002, not 2011",Be aware of the true date of publication. Amazon seems to be bending the rules about the date of publication for electronic media. Why is a facsimilie of a book published in 2002 advertised as a up to date computer book published less than a year ago? Just because you read this text on a kindle does not make the information ten years newer. Computer books that are ten years old are probably not worth the digital ink that they are made of.
2,Mostly a rehash of the Javadoc,"I bought this book hoping for in-depth coverage of some of the more complicated aspects of Swing. Unfortunately, most of the book is just re-wording the javadoc for each class, with little advice on how to actually use it properly and effectively. This was a very disappointing purchase."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this book at the beginning of a long weekeend, trying to understand how to make a JTable editable with combos. By the end of the 3rd day I rushed to the bookstore and got my money back. Then I bought the Swing book my Robinson/Vorobiev and my table with combos was ready in half an hour, understanding what I was doing."
3,"OK, but I like Zukowski's better","I glanced at this book and John Zukowski's _Definitive Guide_, and decided at the time that they were more or less the same, and that a serious Java Swing programmer should own at least one, but not both. After having bought both books (my Zukowski was in the World Trade Center), I've decided that I was very wrong in my assessment. This book is not bad, but Zukowski's goes into much more detail and provides better sample code, especially in the section on JTables."
2,There are better books,"This book is mostly a restatement of the info available in the javadocs for Swing. As such, it's more of a reference work than a tool for learning about the fine points of using Swing. A far better book for learning and using Swing is ""Core Java Foundation Classes"". It's full of examples and why you'd approach a problem one way rather than another. Based on my ""postit-its"" rating system (how many post-it's I have marking key areas of a book for quick access), Core Java Foundation Classes is 8 times more useful than Java Swing."
2,Needs follow up,"Just as there's ""Java Examples in a Nutshell"" (the Alligator book), there needs to be a ""Swing Examples in a Nutshell."""
2,Not the best Swing book on the market.,"This was the first Swing book that I bought and although it got me started I can't help feeling that it is quite badly organised and feels like a ""rush job"". My other criticism is that the examples usually cover just the simple uses of a component ignoring the more complicated uses. Despite this I did find the look and feel chapter to be very good, however in hindsight this would not be my first choice for Swing reference."
2,Only a fair book,"The book not too much more than a rehash of the Javadocs for Swing. For the beginner, not enough example and explanation. The authors also frequently assume a familiarity with AWT - a bad assumption. For beginners, Sun's on-line Swing tutorial is much much better.For advanced programmers, this book is not much better than Sun's Javadoc. Most programmers will use the Javadoc since this book is not laid out well.Also, the binding on the book comes apart pretty quickly."
1,New 4-line phone -- does not work,The new 4-line desk phone -- the mic did not work right out of the box -- when I wrote back with this status and asked for a replacement unit all I got was an email reply suggesting that I return it with no answer to whether it could be replaced. I am now returning the unit.
3,A so so phone,"We don't have a bunch of stuff to compare these phones to but we would not buy them again.We will continue to use them but considering they are Panasonic, I thought they would work better."
3,Panasonic KX-TS4300 - Fair phone,"Follow-up: After exchanging this phone twice for refurbished ones, they all have the same speakerphone problem, and Panasonic has essentially said ""tough luck...not our problem"". To hell with Panasonic.--------------For $140, I expected a better phone...two key problems -- Even though I subscribe to caller ID, when someone is calling and I'm on the line already, the other line doesn't go to the answering machine. It just rings and rings until the person gives up.- The speaker phone doesn't work right after just 4 months...giving out, making horrible noises. They tell me to reboot the phone, which helps temporarily, but then the problem returns.On a positive note, their customer service is exceptionally responsive and helpful. Very uncommon these days where it's usually hard to reach a human being, and even harder to get a problem resolved satisfactorily."
4,Nice phone,"We have used this phone in our office now for a couple years. While I agree the speaker phone is semi-annoying and there is a problem with people hitting voice mail when you're on the line, I have had no other problems. We have multiple phones hooked up on multiple extensions and the phone works great. Unless you want to get a big phone system, I'm not sure you can do too much better here..."
2,Speaker does not work,"Overall it is a good phone, but speakerphone is malfunctioning. It has not worked as expected since day 1.People complaint that they can't hear me, or hear choppy sounds.Called Panasonic, they told me they can't replace it because they no longer make it.Referred me to local authorized repair shop, but I doubt they will be able to fix it.I have always used Panasonic phones for my offices, this is actually a big surprise to me. Phone is well made, but has few flaws."
1,Terrible product. Do not buy it.,"This phone system sis terrible. I have 3 employees and the system does not meet basic needs. For example, if someone is on the phone, a new caller cannot leave a message for that person. This is a basic functionality. Thiskey pad is slow and the system is overall very cheap. I am returning this immediately."
5,Quality midi lathe,"Much nicer than other brands that I have looked at. Have had for several years, mostly pen making. Some bowl work, turning green wood especially during the winter when it was fresh was fun, with ice water flinging off. Have not had any issues with the motor, switch, or bed. Quality built, it's not a Oneway lathe, but it's not priced like one either. Easy to teach general lathe work. Have taught several in the family using this lathe."
4,Hard to beat for the money,"First of all the specs were accurate. The dimensions were true. With a little tuneup and adjusting it was as advertised, except for the 1/2 horse motor. Don't expect half of a horse in that little motor. The value is still good for dollar spent."
5,great fun!,"I received my lathe as a Christmas gift. It arrived in excellent condition. Some reviews that I read on this product stated that the Jet was a better quality. I can see what they mean. But functionally this is one smooth machine. I had so much fun with it on Christmas day that I was an hour late for dinner with my family! It works great! I am a beginner and intend on using my mostly for turning pens. I turned several today and my wife was amazed at the results. The machine is quiet, smooth ... I love it! Great product at a great price!"
4,PSI TCLPRO,"Ordered this for turning game calls,good price, free shipping,ordered it on a Saturday and it was on the porch Thursday. Hauled the box to the basement and it was running in 30 minutes. Very smooth operation. Everythings there, nothing broken. Good value for $159."
2,TLCPRO PSI,"This lathe is good for the money. The toolrest that comes with it is a piece of junk. It broke the same day I got the lathe PSI made me send it back. Delivery confirmation confirmed they received but after almost two weeks I had heard nothing, I called and they said they couldn't find it but would ship a new one off. Needless to say the whole experience was horrible, my lathe sat with no toolrest for two weeks, brand new. I have little confidence if anything realy goes wrong with the lathe, but hopefully by then I will own a bigger and better lathe."
4,Great Lathe for the price,"This lathe does everything it is supposed to do. It is as heavy as... so it does not really need to be fastened down. However, that is also a problem since you have to make belt adjustments from the back-side of the lathe which requires you to at least turn it around...if you do not have enough room in your shop to move around it. Otherwise, it does what I need to do and I am pleased with it."
2,Seemed decent but mine had bearing issues!,Mine had a head stock bearing issues. It had bearing noise and had trouble coming up to speed. Seemed to be pretty decent other than the bearing issue and you can certainly end up with a bad bearing on just about any machine.
2,Get the JET,"Got this for Christmas from my wife.Turned 2 pens and the motor quit working.The tool rest is junk, it had a big burr on the top where the tools run across.One of the handles was broke when I unpacked it.Sent the motor, tool rest & handle back to them. Have not heard anything back from them."
5,This book is not out-of-print in the U.K.,"My borrowed copy of ""Mawson's Will"" indicated that it was published in the U.K. under ""This Accursed Land"" and so I ordered it from Amazon.com under that title. It arrived very shortly and now I have my own, even a ""large print"" version of Mawson's Will!"
1,"Nothing special, kind of a hack job, bad grammar.....","I ordered this book, thinking it you be a unique twist on Low carb dieting, but it is just a rehash of everything else out there...I sent it back after reading it for a 1/2 hour. Chris Aceto is an excellent nutrition author, which led me to purchase this book, but it is not one of his better works."
2,grammatically ridiculous,"I didn't think it was possible, but this book is as poorly written as the previous ""Everything You Need To know About Fat Loss"". I took a chance thinking there was no way anybody would let him make so many basic grammatical errors again but I was wrong. Whatever happened to proofreading? I am sorely dissapointed. It's sad because I believe the info to be decent but there are VERY basic 3rd grade mistakes on virtually every page. How this even got published is beyond me. Sentence fragments abound, the rules of punctuation are routinely massacred and the net effect is a patently unreadable text. I'll give it 2 stars for the content but even that I feel is gracious."
4,A must have for everyone interested in security technology,"Wrote with plain talk, this book is one of the best resources about security on Internet / Intranet. It probably does not cover SSL in depth and I also miss more talking about NT and IIS security implementations. But anyway, a highly recommended book for anyone."
1,NOT HAPPY,"I ordered 2 bottles of this product, one bottle arrived half empty, the other was slightly used. Very disappointed."
4,lots of fun for little hands,"This toy has great big knobs for little hands to pick up. My son is one and has no concept of putting the puzzle together yet. As of now he only likes to take the pieces out and carry them around. It still is an educational toy as you can point to the fruit and tell him what it is and try to help him put the piece in. I like all three of these (fruit, farm and neighborhood) and would highly recommend them."
1,Overserved drunks make a sloppy record!,"And this comes from a fan of Split Enz and Tim Finn! I bought this since Tim is on it along with Andy White and Liam O'Maonlai (ex of Hothouse Flowers) and figured it would be a bit in the pop vein similar to Tim's solo work. WRONG! It's only mildly engaging and sounds like it was recorded after all had helped themselves to the bar. Most songs clink along with mild guitar, bass, percussion, piano and at times horribly off-key singing. At no point does the tempo or subject matter get terribly interesting. Only ""When The Winter Comes"" is very good, and it is hauntingly beautiful...the only redemeening track here. Picture the wonderful ""Finn Brothers"" CD slowed down considerably with trite cliched lyrics and also minus Neil Finn's pop touches and you have ALT."
2,"Bad In A Sloppy, Friendly Way","With vocals either drunken or mumbled and music that is as muddled as a live album, there is little to recommend with this B grade super group. Like all super groups, they disappoint, although given the obscurity of their members, it's not really clear who they are disappointing, skip it, you ain't missing anything. Just go buy another overrated Tim Finn album. Where have all the good times gone."
2,OOPS,Ordered these for baby clothes AS the info states. However the hangers are too large for infant clothes. Too large in width and length. I'll keep them for another day and continue to shop for the actual item I need. I will be shopping elsewhere.
3,Corelle coordinates 5 piece simple lines,"This set is made of a thicker porcelain type of stoneware, not the glassy type of Corelle that the dishes are made from. The color is not exactly as white as the dishes. The product is much thicker and heavier and does not nest the way the dishes and bowls do. That was a major draw for me in chosing the Simple lines dishes, I can easily fit service for 16 and serving bowls (the plain white Corelle) in one kitchen cabinet. I was hoping that I could nest the serving bowls into the casseroles, but there is no way."
2,Pricey and Clunky,"I got this because its the only one thats a square and hence really coordinates with the Simple Lines dinnerware. But its really too big to use for 4 settings, its really heavy and does not feel comfortable to carry....its also very pricey for how much use you get out of it"
5,Great monitor,"I am very happy with this monitor. Great for gaming, and watching DVD's.Great price, and had rebate when I purchased mine.The only negatives are the speakers. I'm not sure I hear anything out of them, but I don't need them. Also, the blue ""on"" light at the bottom middle of the screen. It's a stupid place to put it, and it's too bright. Easily solved by covering it up while I'm playing games or watching DVD's."
3,Troubled monitor,Great monitor when it works. I have lost the Digital side on the first monitor in 6 months. I received a replacement. It has laster another 8 months and now the digital side has failed again. Getting ready to call Viewsonic warranty dept again.
4,Great Image Quality/Great Price,"This monitor has fantastic image quality! As I type I'm watching a video which looks clean and smooth. The base is stable and the monitorr has a quality feel to it. [...] As for negatives I agree with the other reviewers. Viewsonic should not have bothered with the speakers and you shouldn't plan on using them. The little built in speaker that is probably in your computer is nearly as good. I have a cheap pair of external speakers and I was hoping the Viewsonic speakers would replace them for my routine use (I have a wireless connection via airport express to my stereo for MP3 listening) but these speakers aren't usable.Ultimately, you buy a monitor for the image quality. Judged by that criteria this monitor rocks!"
5,Daughter loves it,My 15 year old only wanted printer paper for drawing this Christmas. She was so excited when she got two of these. Will order more.
1,Book is conundrum,"Suffice it to say, this text is awful, an arduous task to understand and conceptualize. I'm taking a lower level geography course with this book as the primary text and find myself ready to punch a wall when attempting to read."
2,BUYERS BE AWARE 8th Edition Published,"Fall 2004 & Spring 2005 Students: the 8th edition of this book is published and comes with a CD, and, in some cases, a free world atlas. Check with your instructor for requirements. In any case, I wouldn't spend $100 for the 7th edition.Haven't read the book yet, so no rating."
4,Excellent Physical Geography Text for college intro course,"One of the most easily understood texts with a great index, glossary, and many illustrations that are very well done."
5,Are YOU Shpongled?,"This album is like a breath of fresh air. But do not think that it is hardcore Goatrance, for it is far from it. It is more like ambient with a smidgen of drum and bass. A very mellow, classy chill out CD. Layers of well-placed sound, exotic melodies, and vivid effects come together seamlessly to elicit a very pleasant experience for the listener. The combination of wispy flutes, powerful baselines, and modern synth is very interesting indeed. Designate a room designed for relaxation and then play this CD on a good stereo system in that same room. Smudge with incense for added ambiance. You will not be disappointed."
3,do not be deceived,"Notice that although the picture has 3 jars of salsa, you only get one jar of salsa. It is not made clear in the product description, which is annoying."
5,L-Pad Value,"Radio Shack wanted over $50 for this item.It is hi quality and works well.good, sensative control. BUY IT!"
4,Great for readers like me who like to laugh...,"...and don't want to think too hard.Not Pulitzer Prize material, but the kind of book you'd keep on hand to go back and read every year for a chuckle.There are lots of zany characters...like in a special two-hour episode of ""The Love Boat."" I especially liked the dialogue throughout; it was true-to-life, gritty when necessary, and sufficiently colloquial at the right times.Bottom line: it makes for fun reading."
5,love the old songs,"I still say,that if it wasn't for Buddy Holly,getting Waylon started in the music business. Waylon would have not a hard time getting started but eventually he would get his foot inside the record business today.aia like all of the outlaw albums that Waylon and Willie did togeter.They were a great team togeher.I will be one to miss Waylon Jennings.He was a giant to me in the music business.And he is sadly missed in the world of country music."
1,Cobra 9870 makes FALSE claims of functionality.,The Cobra 9870 radar detector claims to be undetectable to the Spectre 'radar detector detector' - this is simply NOT true. I got my unit confiscated today by the police in Ontario as a result of this claim. The manufacturer also claims that the unit can detect the Spectre. This is also FALSE. I held the 9870 right in front of the police officers Spectre and the 9870 detected NOTHING!I find these false claims appauling and I want my money back not only for the unit (purchased at Amazon) but also for the fine.I will pursue this with Cobra and Amazon.
1,Cobra ESD 9870,"I got prompt shipment, however the product its self was not any good. I was told this was a brand new never out of the box radar detector, however I found out from Cobra that this product was defected. I don't know if this product was defected from the factory or if this product was a refurbish, but Cobra has sent me a replacement for this unit."
1,Marketing Fluff,"Cobra has you fooled with marketing fluff. There is no such thing as ""11 Bands"". There are only 3 radar bands and 1 laser band. That's it. They count the different brands of radar guns as different bands, they count the different brands of laser guns as different band, they count VG-2 as a band (it's not a band it's a type of gun). It's all marketing fluff to get you to spend more money.As far as radar detectors being legal in the United States, that is not completely true either. They are illegal in Virginia and Washington D.C.Don't waste your money it's all hype. The less expensive brands will give you more bang for your buck and they do the exact same thing."
3,nice pan but..,"This would be the perfect fry pan for me if it wasnt for the somewhat rounded bottom. The pan rocks toward the heavy handle, causing the oil to puddle to that side. If you have a gas stove this is probably not a problem because of the way the cast iron ""fingers"" support the pan over the flame. But if your have a glass top stove or an electric with the standard spiraled type element, I'd recomend getting a different pan."
4,A Worthy Recording Indeed,"I couldn't praise the recording as rapsodically as ""Musican/Erikfan/Artist,"" but for me it was considerably better than ""about what you could expect.""I was not enraptured by the emphasis on cello and violin in the Phantom music, as ingenious and well played as it is, but prefer the greater use full orchestra and its different sections in the Woman in White suite. I purchased the live recording of The Woman in White and have played it many times. Perhaps having seen the show makes a difference. Whatever the opinions of others might be (I haven't read the other reviews), I like the music from The Woman in White very much and enjoyed this adaptation of it in the Phantasia recording.I should think that this recording would be a good by for Phantom fans and for fans of Andrew Lloyd Webber's music."
4,Phantasia Review,"The music is beautiful, the shipping was fast. The only thing I am disappointed in is that it is broken down into the two suites. I am going to have to do a little editing to use this in my wedding but that is fine."
2,Just about what you would expect,"I purchased the live theatre recording of The Woman in White a few months ago and only listened to it one time. Like a lot of people who have reviewed it here, I found it quite unrewarding and may have to listen to it a few more times. I am a big fan of Michael Crawford, he is very good in this recording and makes the most of it, but I only wish his part had been larger.If you are a fan of the Phantom of the Opera, you will enjoy that part of the recording although it is a bit choppy. If you are expecting to be carried away by beautiful melodies from Woman in White, you will be disappointed. However, it is certainly a must for Lloyd-Webber fans. I only wish I could say some more favorable things about this recording."
3,"This is NOT the cologne, only the after-shave. VERY VERY SLOW shipping","This is not the cologne, only the after shave. This was my fault but still, read carefully as I did not. That's not what bothers me though. This was an amazon prime item however it took over 2 weeks to get it to me.VERY SLOW processing and shipping. The product was fine and I did eventually get it. Still very poor handling of the product."
3,"Cute, but won't last long","I like these shoes - I've had them for a couple of months and have worn them several times. The fit is true to size, and the black patent straps look great. The only problem is, after wearing them a few times, the suede insole (under the ball of your foot and toes) turns dark from normal wear and sweat. The espadrille heel seemed to stain really easily (I've only worn them to work). If your plan is to only wear them for the summer and you get them at a good price, then it's worth the purchase."
2,Small contect hidden in wordy writimg style.,"This book has decent contect, but it seems as though the author wrote it simply to show off how well she can write. It is too difficult to gain anything from this book because you get lost in the long winded sentence structure. I would not recommend this book to other healthcare providers."
3,cool....,Ok so I think these are very clever!!! but to warn you my girls pulled out the color sticks that were inside and broke them up so now i have hoolow casings!!! they are cool and i would use them. just watch out for those clever kids.....
5,Love them!,I purchased these crayons because I became tired of my son eating his sisters' crayons and having to constantly peel them when they weren't sharp anymore.With a little twist you constantly have a nice point available that has not broken to date. The kids love them. I love this set because it comes with 6 sets of 8 colors; so you can give each child their own set and have some in storage for when they lose or break them.
5,Great young players,"In a recording we expect perfect playing ....one will not be disappointed here. The playing and pitch are perfect, and the nuances are incredible and the SOUND... Well, it is breathtaking ... In short, these musicians deliver an extraordinary performance that matches or exceeds anything on recording. They may not be famous yet but they soon will be....."
1,Wrong songs in my CD,"I am very angry! Though the cover and everything indicates that the tracks are of Felix and all the cats, the songs are awful, probably of a rap band. What a terrible mistake you did!!!!! I`ll leave NY without the CD I wanted so bad."
2,Don't expect much,"This really seems more like something Alan Moore did when he had to work at being deep, like in high school. It has none of the layered complexity of anything else I've ever read by him, and whatever simple surprises there are in the story are easily figured out beforehand. Not much of anything happens in A Small Killing, and even by the late 80s (when the book was originally released) characters being stalked by demonic children was pretty stale.So I guess consider avoiding anything Alan Moore describes as ""deeply personal"". He's way more interesting dealing with superheroes and society at large. I'd have given it a rating of 1 if the art weren't kind of cool."
2,"C'mon, Alan, you can do better than that!","A Small Killing is definitely not one of Alan Moore's best stories, but it does contain some interesting literary ideas about memory and guilt. The art by Oscar Zarate did not really captivate me and I found myself actually speeding through the book rather than savoring the panels as I would a well-drawn comic or graphic novel. Not that Zarate does not draw well; it's just that his style does not appeal to me, with its wavy lines and scenes that could have been a bit more detailed. Alan Moore uses beautiful prose, but the story is ultimately boring and does not allow the reader to sympathize with the main character Timothy Hole during his brief encounters with his other self, which is basically what the entire book consists of. Overall, a disappointing read."
2,What??,"A very convoluted story that really never gives any suspense because the answer is the only obvious conclusion. Truly a ""huh?""."
5,SMOOTH AS SILK!,"I picked this up at my local Starbucks.And....WOW! This is by far the BEST coffee that I have ever tasted!It is so incredibly SMOOOOOOOOOTH!Like a mixture of silk and velvet!The smoothest and 'silkiest' coffee ever.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Guatemala Casi Cielo by Starbucks CoffeeGuatemala Casi Cielo - the name means ""almost heaven."" While you don't have to go that far to experience this indescribably rich coffee, you would have to dine at some of the country's finest restaurants. But for a limited time, this culinary masterpiece is available exclusively from Starbucks for your own special occasions."
5,"Perfect, but where is it?","This is easily my favorite coffee in the world, but I'm really unsure how to find it now that Starbuck's has discontinued it. It was a very popular specialty roast for them, so the decision to drop it must have been a pretty serious one. But surely someone is still picking those beans and roasting them. I'd love to know who, because I would buy six pounds of the stuff right now."
5,Educational and spellbounding!,This book is full of wonderful stories told by various Cherokees. It teaches why these stories are important and why they are passed down from generation to generation. Anyone can gain knowledge about Cherokee culture from this stories. There are myths and legends from long ago and there are stories that are from personal experiences. The story tellers tell how they learned each legend and in some cases why the story reflects life today.
5,24 hours is a definite possibility.,"Having used and taught Flash since its earliest versions, I can sincerely vouch that learning Flash is a considerable undertaking. The latest upgrade to version 5 only compounds this fact, yet Phillip Kerman has nonetheless written an excellent resource for getting a good, solid jumpstart. It is very fortunate that this book does NOT gloss over the fundamentals nor spare the reader important exposure to Flash's more complex features. This book is written by someone who intimately understands this product and multimedia development in general. As this book is also thorough and sensitive to the neophyte, I am recommending it as the textbook in my future coursework."
5,Incredible book about Flash,"Wow I'm almost at the end of this book and it's simply marvelous what the author can teach you with such an easy to follow narrative. Mr. Kerman has the ability to teach you advanced stuff with simple step by step examples..he is the best Flash writer I've read. He is the FLASH TEACHER!!..This book is an uncommon ""Teach Yourself in 24 hours"" book, because he goes beyond the basics and while you read you feel that you have learned and learned well and understand what you just read.This is the FLASH book to learn. Then get an advanced ActionScript book and you will be a FLASH PRO..A WINNER!!"
4,A good book to have on a nearby desktop.,"This book makes me feel confident, like I am working with a net. It treats you to the nitty gritty of Flash 5 in Bite size, 2 page chunks. A bit slow and dry starting for me, but a great way to learn Flash. I found the screen shots of the console could be more helpful if I could see them better. Not all Flash developer ""gonna bees"" have perfect eyesight. Otherwise, I would have given the book 5 stars. It is a well priced entry and advanced level self-teaching guide."
2,in 24 hours? No way,This book is a little too simplistic for my taste. I suppose if you didn't know how to turn on a machine it might be helpful. I was really kid of disappointed. .... I returned mine.
5,24hrs! its worth every minute,"i'm just about to start chapter 8, i'm taking a break...Although I plan on finishing this book in 8 days rather than the marketing tool of 24hrs, the book is amazing!Its easy to read, full of easy to follow and useful tasks in each chapter, and has a summary and quiz at the end of each chapter to make sure you're paying attention.One thing i like so far is that the author writes like he's talking. He will repeat important things over and over until you yourself have it memorized. LOL!Great book and defenitly a book that I will finish reading and following to the end."
3,Newbies Only.,The book is ideal for beginners and touches base with all the important aspects of flash. A lot of the information presented though can be learned by trial and error or by using the tutorials that come with flash.
2,Too brief,"I got this book from the library. I was quite elated when I got hold of it. Immediately, I poured over the books for a few hours. As I'm a computer person, I'm quite patient in reading up and trying out the tasks from the book. After 4 hours, I decided to return the book tomorrow. Found that the book is very brief in all areas. I personally think that examples are very important to learn something. And I find very little of them in this book. The book will show the basic of doing something and then that's it. Time to go to the next chapter."
5,Un album magnifique,"À travers ses voyages, Rory Mcleod sait faire sortir des rythmes une joie communicative et un entrain indéniable. Un album à savourer en toutes occasions et un artiste à découvrir."
2,Changed my mind... This CD is awesome!,The tracks are great but the mixing is a little too quick. It was definitley heavily produced. Overall I give it 4 stars due to the track selection.
1,This mix is incomplete! Why???,"As brilliant as Armin's mixes are, why are we again short-changed by a track on disc 2 compared to the European release? This already happened once with ASOT 2005! Could someone please explain this to me? As a fan, this is very frustrating... are we not worthy of a complete mix???"
3,Somewhat disappointing,Personally I don't like this one too much. Too many vocals. A State of Trance 2008 is way better (to me at least).
5,Unbelievable!,"This is the best trance cd ive ever heard. If you're fed up with most trance albums, like I am, that only have a few good songs, this cd is a dream come true. All the way through Armin's track selection flows unbelievably well, and this state of trance blows every other one away, even 06 . Like 06, both cds have the ""on the beach"" and ""in the club"" theme, and armin does the best job at making you feel you're there. The songs sound amazing and the vocals are great(theres quite a few). This cd should put him at #1 in the world, anyone who listens to trance must get this album"
1,Does not have english subtitles- no communication from seller,"I purchased this video for a Christmas gift for my sister, and it was shipped in time, which was great.The problem is that the video does not come with English subtitles, which it does not say in the description.I wrote to the seller to ask if there was either a version with subtitles to exchange it for, or, if there was a way other buyers were able to get English sub-titles (SAP) to work with this video; I recieved no reply. Its been about 20 days since I wrote to the seller. Will contact again, to request a refund, but since my sister had to open the video and put it in to watch it to find out there were no subtitles, I may not be given one. That is if the seller gets back to me. Can't use this dvd, so its worthless."
1,"Like others, arrived with half the ink pads dried out...","I read the reviews, but gambled and ordered anyway, hoping all the complaints of dried ink pads were a fluke or a problem that's been addressed.Unfortunately, nope. That's a big disappointment since our experience with Melissa & Doug products has so far been pretty solid.Of the six pads, three were completely dry -- no color whatsoever. And yet the other three remained moist, and left vibrant imprints. Too bad.I did try to revitalize the dried pads with a small amount of water (these being water-based ink pads. That didn't do anything but make the pads into soggy, colorless sponges.It's frustrating to have to send a ten dollar item back, but I'm going to just on the principle of the matter. My recommendation is to hold off on purchasing this product until you notice these one-star reviews begin to ""dry up."" I'm hoping the company will reformulate or repackage these sets to provide a better product."
5,Buyer Beware!,"The list/retail price for this product is not $9.99 but $5.99 (you can check it at Melissa and Doug's website)! It's not really 45% off. Just so you know, in case you're buying it because you think you'll be saving money."
4,My kid loves it,"It's beautiful and easy to use and carry around. My kid loves to add stamps to her drawings and colorings, and it's a good price too."
2,Dried Up Ink,"I have to do my Christmas shopping, when taxes come back. So, as usual I did so this year, and when my kids opened presents yesterday, you'll understand why I was VERY upset, when BOTH stamp pads were DRY.... So now if I return these items, they want me to pay for every thing. I guess we'll see, if they make things right...."
2,Ink was all dried up,I love Melissa and Doug toys and we have several of their stamps so I decided to buy extra ink for it. The ink arrived all dried up. I added some water hoping there would be some color but it's pretty much worthless. Very disappointed!!!
1,Dried out,Couldn't use because it was all dried out when I opened it!I expect much more from Melissa & Doug products.
1,Completely dried out. Unusable.,"I was pretty bummed when we opened it up, and the ink pads were completely dry. I tried to moisten them a little, but it had no effect. We've bought many Melissa and Doug products over the years, and this is the first time anything like this has happened; I assume our stamp pad was just sitting in a warehouse somewhere for too long. It's my own fault that I waited more than 30 days to try it out, so I could not return it to Amazon.EDIT: I finally got around to calling the manufacturer about this, and they were very nice and are shipping a replacment. Thanks Melissa and Doug!"
1,Dry and useless,I ordered 5 of these pads for a classroom project. Only one arrived wet enough for use. The others were almost completely dry and useless. How does this happen? A project that my first-graders should have been able to do independently in groups turned into an individual time-wasting debacle. I will not buy anything with this company's name again.
3,Dull Ink,"The washable ink is passable, but the colors are dull and difficult to get enough on the stamp to make any decent impressions. For instance, we pressed very hard using our thumbs to make thumbprints, and the red and purple and orange were very difficult to get enough ink on our fingers to make thumbprints. Once we made the prints, the colors were faint. The brightest, most visual color was yellow followed by blue and green. Buy this if there is no decent alternative."
2,too dry,The stamp pad is dry and will not come off on the stamps. Seems like you should be able to buy one of those rolling ink tubes to freshen it up so it would work.
1,Ink pad was awful,When we received it the ink was dry and didn't work. Tried to add water to it and it still didn't work.
1,Poor quality,I bought this as part of a birthday gift for my 7 year old niece. 3 of the 6 colors arrived dried out and unusable My niece was very disappointed and so was I.
1,Needs washable ink refills.,"If the stamp pad had washable ink refills available it would be a great itemfor the preschoolers I teach. It can be highly ecucational for color identification and with the stamps I can purchase; numbers, ABC's etc canbe playfully taught. But the pad arrived dry and I cannot findwashable ink refills to fill the pad and make it usable."
1,Dry Ink.. :(,"I ordered this as a gift for my 9 year old niece, to go along with a thumbprint art book. She opened it on her birthday, and found 5 out of the 6 colors to be basically dry.. :( Blue was the only pad we could get some color out of. Kinda disappointed."
1,only contained dried out sponges,how disappointing this product was for our family. We were all so excited to start making our thumbprint art but the only color we could use wad the blue - all the other colors were dried up!! Even adding some distilled water did not help.I would give NO stars if I could!I am going to contact Melissa & Doug company to complain about the Rainbow 6 Color Stamp Pad.
1,Stamp pad ink.,"The stamp pad ink had dried out on all of the pads, except the blue pad.There needs to be better packaging around the stamp pads."
1,Disappointed,"I got this to use in my classroom for stamps and for creating art with finger prints. The pad is very dry. I can't even get a regular stamp to show up on the paper when using it. The colors are so faint, and don't coat the stamps. I am so disappointed. A complete waste of my money."
1,Unusable ink pads,"This would really be a nice set - except most of the colors are dried out and unusable. I should have read before. I ordered 2 sets in different sizes, and they are both mainly dry and no imprints."
1,"Nice Sized Ink Pads, Just No Ink!",This item looked like it was going to be perfect for my 3 year old and her stamps; however the ink was completely dried up! I was very disappointed in this product! The pads themselves were large and would have been perfect! What a bummer!
2,I agree with other reviewers: Not enough ink!,"Like others, we had to push really hard to get a bit of ink on the stamps. It seemed to dry out really quickly. This bored my kids, who then decided it wasn't worth playing with. This, naturally, annoys me no end because I wish I hadn't wasted money on it.Has anyone found any suitable ink refills?"
2,light colors are dry,"The dark colors work great, and are wet. The light colors are dry and - as another reviewer said - useless. Not sure if I'll be able to return this, but I'll try."
2,Never again indeed,"I bought this by mistake, having confused it with a band I heard on the radio having a similar name that sounded vaguely like They Might Be Giants. Being opened minded, I listened to the whole thing anyway. There are 10 songs, which is about 5 times as many songs as ideas, musical or otherwise. (For example, one song talks about cities made of steel, glass, plastic, marble, stone, and wood; another song, equally tiresomely, talks about doors made of marble, iron, and plate glass.) A few of the songs have a sufficiently strong beat to make them danceable, in which case the lyrics don't matter. Probably kids will love it. And if you don't have kids just putting this on the stereo is probably enough to create the illusion that your house is full of teeny-boppers, although why anyone would want to do that is beyond me."
1,how about just plain Never Again,"this music reminds me of the teletubbies show. when one watches that program one feels as if some shadowy think tank put a great deal of effort into contriving insidious ways to make kids go bananas. supersystem has done something similar with you, the indie music fan. their cross demographic analysis of all the ""hot"" trends has yielded this album ""Always Never Again"", which after listening to it called to mind as dirty a word as there is in all of music terminology: ""fusion"". but as with Nirvana spawning Bush, the simulacrum is never quite as good as the original. and besides, when i feel someone is transparently pandering to me, i don't like it. but hey, the teletubbies show gets good ratings, so maybe listen to a couple of clips and see what you think."
2,Very Uncomfortable,"After using these headphones for 1-2 hours my right ear was experiencing some very bad pain. Apparently I must have very small ears, because even the smallest sleeve completely cut off circulation when in use. On the bright side, they sounded fantastic, but if you have small ears, these aren't gonna work for you.You can tell how big they are from the minute you open them, much larger than other earphones in the same quality market. They are also very cumbersome to wear since due to their size and the special way you have to insert them in the ears every time.I've since been using a pair of q-jays, and they're actually comfortable so I can use them. As far as sound quality goes, it's probably a toss up between the Shure 420's and the q-jays. The q-jays are ~$30 cheaper, immensely smaller, and come with sleeves that have a larger range of sizes. They also have the dual tweeter design, with a smaller housing, so there's less leakage of air in the housing."
5,Cajun-Country at it's best,"This has become probably my favorite Cajun-Country album and artist. Based on this, I later sought out the newer ""I'm Back"" and ""Sweeter The Wine,"" and was not disappointed. Belton stays true to his early style and sound, though he brings in a little modernization on the most recent work.If you want that authentic fiddle-and-steel kind of Real Country, the kind that seemed to disappear after the 60s, and also love the authentic sound of Real Cajun from the same era, it don't get no better than this. --P. Moratto, Houston"
3,3 stars,"*** If you are familiar with the Westminster Confession of Faith, then you don't need to spend time figuring out what the purpose of your life is or if there is a purpose. You know that the chief end of man (or woman) is to glorify God and enjoy Him forever. But how? It's not as simple as it might sound. The author has defined seven problems that prevent one from fulfilling this goal and then gives a clear method for achieving it. Every chapter is heavily referenced in relation to scripture and to the great Christian thinkers, such as Tozer or Brother Lawrence. Every section includes questions and action steps the reader can take, and it may be used alone or in a group setting. ***Amanda Killgore."
2,Not as good as the other Kitchenaid Clad pieces,"I bought this steamer for the 3-quart Kitchenaid saucepan. It does not fit well and tips when there is no food in it. I believe this is due to the lip of the pan as well as the fact that the steamer has the handle of a regular saucepan and thus tips when empty. I rang Kitchenaid customer service (and I only have nice things to say about them) and they sent me a new 3-quart saucepan. The same problem exists. As it is the pan this steamer is designed to be used on, this is somewhat of a problem. Of course, while there is food in it, it steams perfectly well."
4,An entertaining read,Rychetnik provides a brief yet entertaining look into the bush pilots of Alaska. His presentation is humorous and easy to read. Definitely worth a look for all those interested in the funnier side of bush flying.
5,Stunning documentary,This was a part of history I had never heard about before and I have studied a lot of WW2 history. It's an incredible story beautifully told. I fell in love with the survivors who told their stories with such unbelievable courage and raw honesty. I cried at the brutality but even more so for the beauty of these luminous souls who lived to tell about it. This is humanity at its darkest and at its brightest. I'm so grateful to everyone who brought this film into being. What a tragic loss if these men had died in silence.
2,Hard to Follow,"An all right video, but if you don't speak and understand German, it's very difficult to understand. Translations would help immensely."
1,What the...,"OK,I understand this is a great movie. I just saw part of it on ""Current"". BUT! How do you justify the price of the disc? You're doing nothing for the cause if no one can aford to see what your cause is about."
3,i wanted more...,"The truth about homosexual persecution in Nazi Germany told by 6 survivors, using real footage from the times and documentary/interview style storytelling.I find it interesting how they only targeted gay men. Nazis declared lesbianism a ""temporary and curable problem.""Anyway, an interesting little documentary... not enough substance to it though in my opinion- although that might be because none of the men wanted to talk about their experiences. I imagine they get tired of all the interviews and having to relive those things...""Do you want butter or guns?""And the people cried ""Guns!""And at that my Father became afraid."""
4,Very good book,"This is a very good cookbook with about 3 recipes per page. It uses vegetables and low fat ingredients. And also things like Equal sugar, tabasco, Mrs. Dash and fat free things. All of the recipes are low in calories and fat content as well as low in cholesterol. The content are from Soups to Dessert. It serves about 2-4."
1,Can't find ingredients,I could not find some of the ingredients that were listed in the recipes. Most of them called for (sodium free) Accent or Mrs. Dash. All of which were not available at my local grocery. Some called for Sweet 'N Low in main dishes and a lot called for wine....which I do not keep in the house. I did not find these recipes helpful to me in my fight for a more fat free lifestyle.
3,Looking for a recipe,I have bought several of these cookbooks looking for a Spaghetti sauce recipe that I had gotten from one of their shows many years ago. It was Kathy Lee's Mother's recipe for her Mama Mia Meatsauce I thought is what it was called. I misplaced it and it was the best sauce I have ever made! If anyone has this recipe and want to share I would so appreciate it!
5,Oh yeah!,"Oh yeah...another winner by regis and kathie lee. This book is a good addition to your bookshelf if you're keen on entertaining, giving parties, or just looking for holiday tips. While most of their books are good, I foud this especially helpful since it even covered holidays and parties. I came across many new and different ideas, not to mention ones that are economical and REALLY REALLY useful. If you've read all there is to read on this subject, then this book is just another one of them, but if not, then this is a definite addition to your bookshelf. But either way, this book is also a lot of fun,so you'll want to read it anyway."
3,8 in non-stick open skillet,this item is great and goes along with all the other Kichen-Aid standards. The only neg was do not wash in the dishwasher and it scraches real easy. great for eggs and crapes... Another wonderful Kichen-Aid product..... I dont know what our family would do without all of the products they have to offer.... OUR GRANDMOTHER HAS A STAND MIXER KICHEN-AID FOR @ 45 + YRS AND STILL GOING STRONG... QUALITY IS WORTH A LITTLE MORE IN THE COST... WORTH EVERY PENNIE..... TRY ANY OF THE PRODUCTS YOU WILL SAVE ALOT OF [...] IN THE LONG RUN....JILL
3,Wagner Marches - Forget This Noise,"OK, you have read various autobiographical stuff by RW. Perhaps you think the marches and overtures on this CD are undiscovered gems, inasmuchas you have often read about them but never heard them?Wrong. To be polite about the matter, the `musical' compositions on this CD are, how you say, garbage. You will listen to it once with curiosity, then swear that such banality will never again cross your musical realm. Sadly, the stories behind the musical pieces are much more interesting than the music itself.Since the compositions are of such low caliber, my rating relates strictly to Wagner's compositions, and NOT the performances as such. With such trash, it is hard to imagine any orchestra and conductor coming up with a decent musical experience; pity the musicians forced to perform such pablum."
3,A good read...but not much new here,"First, let me start off by saying that Anne Edwards ""Early Reagan"" is one of my favorite books about Reagan. Her latest, The Reagans: Portrait of a Marriage"" is a good read but there really isn't much new information Reagan fans and scholars don't already know about these remarkable people. My biggest criticism of this book is that I believe Edwards overdoes the old stereotype that Nancy wore the pants and was the brains behind the man and his rise to power and what a dragon lady she was. Parts of the book are very unfair, in my opinion, to Nancy and come pretty close to doing a hack job. In that regard, it's disappointing. Still, Edwards knows her subjects very well and the book is very easy to read and uncluttered. The last chapter does bring the story of Reagan's life up to date with his struggle with Alzheimers. Overall, a good read about two fascinating people and their loving relationship."
5,Get the word out!,"I can't stress enough just how good this album is. A perfect blend of indie, folk and maybe even a bit of country, this is easily one of my favourite ""indie"" albums.Nearly every track is catchy and memorable; simple but down to earth the melodies and vocals evoke a lot of soul from an otherwise self obsessed and increasingly vapid genre.If you're a fan of ""traditional"" indie music, don't let the country label scare you. It simply reflects the twangy guitar, at times haunting vocals and small town feel.And if you're a fan of country and folk, don't let the indie label scare you! Think of it as a new twist on some of your old favourites.I highly recommend this album and sadly, I don't think my review does justice to the depth and just great sound of the tracks. Give it a listen!"
2,"Confusing, lacking examples and equations...","This book is well-intended, covering a fairly wide array of concepts. However, open the book from either the front or back, and you will find nice large, empty inside front and back covers! This is the first chemistry/physics/engineering text I've encountered with no equations, constants and conversions printed immediately inside the covers(or anywhere else, for that matter)! This one fact makes the book difficult and time-consuming to use for completing homework assignments and learning new concepts. A near total lack of diagrams, charts or graphic representation of concepts is also disappointing."
2,Inefficient and ineffective.,"My prof. utilized this text for the first time last semester, and assumed it would be a good text. My background was Chem I, Chem II, Organic Chem, and Quantitative Analysis. I and a classmate with a similar background both found this text to be ineffective and inefficient. For example, one must page to Chapter 5 before finding a periodic table; every chemistry text I've seen thus far includes one on the opening pages. The treatment of atomic orbital energies was the worst I've ever seen - what introductory texts handle with a few well-chosen diagrams was written out into a page of excruciating text (p 146-147). Equations were given, but it was not always readily clear what each symbol stood for; examples were nearly non-existant. I was so excited about this course and I'm just grateful that the instructor was of much higher quality than the text."
4,good jazz!!!,"great songs. it goes from classic or conservative jazz to contemporary electro jazz. if you are looking for a lounge cd i wouldnt recommend it. this cd needs to be heard several times to get the feeling of the ""new conception of jazz"" it certainly does have a new one!"
4,nail fixer,"I have had problem finger nails all my life. Splitting, peeling etc. Nail Optimizer is an great product and it helped my nails wonderfully. But it takes time. Not yet available at Amazon but assume soon will be is Prolana's (previously Olan Labs) newest product Optimax. Terrific product which works more quickly."
3,Fun to use,"We purchased this as a Christmas gift and had the pleasure of using it with the receiver. I like the look of it, however it is very hard plastic. There are models out there now that are made of softer plastic that don't kill your fingers."
5,Easy to clean,I have a set of anolon Titanium pans and love them because they cook well and are easy to clean.
5,Exceptional coloring and even heat,"I am a serious cook and have always detested almost every attribute of non-stick pans. I finally caved to improve my french-style omelettes with this pan but was astonished to note that this pan can brown as effectively as my cast iron, reaches higher temperatures on my stove than any metal other than copper, and is excellent under the broiler. I've had the pan now for more than two years and it is still in excellent condition. Almost as fast as copper, better browning than stainless, and easily as even as iron with much simpler care. I've never given this glowing a review of any product. I'm buying a couple as presents, and thought I'd leave a review for this incredible pan."
2,Not What It Used To Be,"I have to totally agree with the people that say this isn't NEAR the quality that Cosmic Catnip used to be. My cat always went wild for this brand, but I could smell absolutely no scent & the cat completely ignored it. He's a catnip junkie, so I purchased another brand & he's happy now. This went in the garbage. It wasn't worth returning, so I just dumped it. I'm really glad I didn't spring for a larger size. ""And Yes, my bag also had rough sticks in it too"""
1,She didn't like it :(,"After reading rave reviews about Cosmic Catnip I decided to give it a try. My cat loves Petsmart(store)brand catnip but I couldn't get to Petsmart so I decided to give this a go. She didn't respond in the slightest to it. When I sprinkled a little on the carpet she sniffed and walked away:(I'm sure this might be a very good brand,afterall many other's have said how much their kittys enjoy it,but it wasn't the right one for ""HRH"" Maiza."
2,Some of the topics are not covered thoroughly,"Brought this book based on its 4/5 star rating -- was disappointed. I am not an Access newbie and have some programming experience. At times, the book and its example are hard to follow. Many capters are not covered thoroughly. A collogue of mine also finds this book lacking its depth. The book does not live-up to its title."
5,Great Book,"I enjoyed this book. It has been very helpful in leveraging Access in my work. I learned to do new things with Access that I hadn't learned before. My only request is that there had been a couple more examples so I could learn more. Other than that, this book was worth every penny."
5,Great replacement at a great price,Part was a perfect fit. Made for an easy repair. Highly recommend using this part. Seems to be identical to the one I took out (without the leaks of course).
5,Great company,"I bought the Travel Time Tent & Tunnel Combo for my 2 1/2 yr. old grandson for Christmas. It was an immediate hit. The tent is roomy enough for him and his younger brother and I can even sit inside with him to read books. It does take up a large amount of space, but if you have the room, it will provide a great inside play area. One of the tent poles bent ( not sure how )and I called Pacific Play Tents costumer service to order a replacement. They were very courteous and the replacement was shipped the following day at no charge. I will definitely buy their products again !"
3,2 1/2 qt? really?,"Like my pan set, the pan set that Amazon says people who buy this also buy has a 1qt, 2qt, & 3qt saucepan. Not a 2.5qt saucepan. So I am wondering if this fits one of the pans in my set (and the set which Amazon says that people also buy), or if this only works in a 2.5qt pan.This is not a real review, as I do not have this item... it is more of a question. At $85, it is improbable that I will be acquiring this item anytime soon."
2,Damp squid,"You really had me going there, Don. Not since Sandra Bullock in 'The Net' has someone been at the centre of such a gigantic conspiracy to silence the individual. The information 'they' were trying so hard to suppress is that the persons responsible were the DIA and SYRIA. Er....."
5,Super South Park With Hankey the POO,This program was the best i've seen and nearly wet myself laughing!!!! the best bit is in the toilet 'The mr.hankey song' and kyles father hears and he comes in to see kyle hloding a piece of poo!! I definetly recommend you see this it's a super video with hilarious characters!!
3,"Feels solid, good features and comfortable but...","Honestly the signal range is very bad, at about 50 feet there's no signal if there's a couple of walls between."
2,Noisy phone,There is an 'echo' noise in the phone. This is suppose to be 'free of any interference' but that is not true. I wish I could return the phone but do not know how and it has been more than a month. I would not recommend this phone to anyone.
1,Middle-aged Mom,"THIS IS THE WORST PHONE I HAVE EVER OWNED! DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE.This is my first review of anything, but I felt this phone was so bad and expensive that you needed to be warned.The display goes blank so you cannot read caller ID and it is impossible to hear anyone or be heard.I bought this phone through Amazon in December 2004. Do not buy!"
1,Broke w/in 1 month,"This product was worth what I paid...cheap. The plug (on the phone side) broke w/in a few weeks of having it, and there was no marking or clear indication as to which side was to face up when plugging the phone section in. Unfortunately, I can't say that the seller got the product to me incredibly fast either as it took almost a week."
2,Great concept; poor execution,"This is a great concept: illustrate principles of physics using art and nature. Unfortunately, the execution is poor. The book's layout is dull, and the whole thing comes across as boring rather than fascinating. I had hoped to share it with someone who doesn't like science, but couldn't, because it would have turned him off even more. A great disappointment."
2,Maybe worth a rental,This video shows naked women having bikinis spray painted on them at woodstock 1999. The huge majority of women in this video are way below average looking. Lots of chubby/skanky women with nasty body piercings & tatoos also. The funny thing about this dvd is there are a couple hotties but they only show them for a few seconds. For example there is a really hot babe at the 32:12 time mark that for some reason they only show for a few seconds and the view isn't the best. If they had spent more time with her this actually could have been a great video. But unfortunately this doesn't happen. I would say there were probably 20 women or so shown.
2,"Some Mini, Some Not!","I bought this book to help give me some better ideas on how to build a small as house as possible, while still keeping it livable. This book does show some good examples for small houses. It also adds in houses that are up to 1,291 sq/ft, which for most people is not a mini house, in fact it would be classed as a normal size house. As I said it did give a few examples that I could imagine living in, but lots of the homes pictured, look cold and lifeless.Also, there are not enough photos of each house to give you an idea what it would feel like to be in. And lots of the photos show the interiors as completely barren looking, as if no one actually lived in them!Get it from your library first before you decide to buy. I won't be adding this book to my listmania list."
2,high end vacation houses . . . not very interesting,"I'm very interested in space-efficient housing, but this book just doesn't interest me. It seems to be mostly high end houses, often in beautiful remote settings, perhaps they are vacation houses; not relevant for most of us. The floor plans are difficult to read and just don't convey much information. I was very disappointed.Oh, and the houses are not particularly ""mini."" Perhaps by today's standards they are small-ish, but that is only because the average new American house is obese."
2,Basics Basics Basics,"Very basic descriptions. Seems like an advertising promo for gyros, sometimes it takes aside objectivity when comparing the gyro tehcnology with helos and planes.Also IMHO a little old material."
2,Basic and superficial.,"I bought this book to learn about how a gyroplane actually flies and maneuvers - the actual physics and aerodynamics of gyrocopter flight. I was very disappointed. This is a very basic introduction to the field of gyroplanes and is very superficial. If you are looking for a groundschool textbook to get a good head start on learning to fly a gyro, this is not for you. Plus, for a very short, skimpy, large-print book, it is very overpriced."
5,Well-written and timely,"McKenzie's account of the Marshall plan era goings-on between the U.S. and France is remarkable in its scope and detail, full of captivating accounts (including, memorably, a pro-American official being ""molested"" by rioters).The inter- and intra-governmental posturing and machinations described in Remaking France are echoed today, some fifty years later."
5,Marvelous Marvin and the Wolfman Mystery,"As Sarah and Marvin lay in their bed, they suddenly jump from some eerie noise. They get up to investagate the noise. It seemed to be coming from their neighbor Mr. Wolfe. As they were walking to Mr. Wolfe's house a blue car pulled up, they jumped behind the bushes a man was carrying something covered in a white bag it looked so much like a human body. Sarah quickly got her camera out and took a snap shot of the man and the body looking thing. The flash from the camera caught the man's eye. He went to investagate and he pulled both of them from the bushes...What will happend to the two youngsters. Read the book to find out. I thought that this was a interesting book with a good twist. It is also very easy to read."
2,Don't bother,"I just completed a course that used this book as a...reference. Granted, it is a first edition, but it reads like a rough draft. The presence of three authors is all too obvious in the inconsistent writing of proofs, paragraphs, and even exercises. Some proofs are just plain wrong, and many have gaping holes in them. Notation is confusing, and changes without warning or explanation. I will say this much in its favor: many important results are presented, although the proofs are absent. It makes a good source for named theorems, but that's about it."
2,Not so impressed,"This book is ok, if you want to learn about native use and things like that. It has good descriptions of lots of rare entheogenic cacti. If all you want to know how to do, is cultivate Lophophora and Tichocerous, the internet has better information."
4,MagiCactus.com,"This is a fantastic little book on Lophophora Williamsii. It offers suggestions on growing as well as removing the main alkaloid for personal reasons... a well rounded list of other hallucinagenic cacti, and overall being the only book on the market about this little plant other than Andersons which speaks mostly about the religious practices tied to this little plant, you have to make it part of your collection. Once you are done here visit my website [...] to learn more about this wonderful little plant where I have put together all the latest information available on Peyote since all the old news is very outdated... you might even have a chance to purchase a nice little plant for yourself or seeds to start growing your own.Happy Growing[...]."
5,"My favorite, too!!!","I love this video best of all of them. The poems take me all the way back to when I was in school in various literature classes. My daughter loves the action on the screen, and I do believe that Bard (the poetic dragon) is her absolute favorite. The video series is captivating -- so many times I've put it on for her, and wound up watching all of it myself. Even if you are one of those parents who shun TV watching, you can't help but to love this type of video for your children. Hats off to Julie Clark!"
2,"Confusing content, uneven audio","The visuals are entertaining for very young children because there is a lot of movement and vibrant colors, but the arrangement of scenes is jumbled and unrelated. Much better editing is necessary. I don't know where Shakespeare comes into the mix for the very young children. The most irritating aspect of this DVD is the uneven audio. The volume often changes from scene to scene which requires constant adjustment. It seems as if whoever finished the entire piece simply cobbled together all the various parts without thought to continuity."
3,where are the children's book authors?,"Love the concept behind this DVD -- never too early to introduce children to poetry. And including poetry not specifically written for children (such as an excerpt from 'A Midsummer Night's Dream') is fine, too. However, there are so many fabulous poets for children writing today. I wish the DVD included these poets' works. It would have served as a fabulous introduction to children of these great writers and their works, and I think it would be way more accessible to children than the poetry that is included. A missed opportunity for sure to spotlight some outstanding children's poets."
2,Fine but Overrated,"I was a bit disappointed by this DVD. First of all, the sound balance was heavily weighted on the side of the music, so that the text was hard to hear. I did concentrate in poetry at university so I love poetry myself but I also found the poetry to be poorly selected -- not really interesting to child or adult and it went by so quickly that I can't imagine that a child would have any educational benefit from it. It seemed to be something used to make parents feel good about buying this DVD and nothing more. The rest of the DVD was really just pretty pictures and like I said earlier, poor sound quality. My child finds it OK but nothing more. I prefer some of the other Baby Einstein DVDs like Numbers Nursery."
3,Doesn't hold baby's attention,"Though the cover says 6 months plus, I really believe this is geared towards older babies.I played this for my 9 month old, and after about 3 mins, he started fussing and squirming and wanted to do something else. He was not into the talking and the puppets, but the music with moving images seemed to spark him a bit...it's a very cute video, but not for younger babies, I would wait till at least one year old to introduce this one to your little one."
2,Disappointed,"After reading so many positive reviews, I moved this item to the top of my z'engaging items for my childz' list. I was sorely disappointed. This Shakespeare DVD follows the identical format of many of the other Einstein videos, tinny music, puppet vignettes, and close-up toy shots. The Amazon inventory listed ""only 1 left"" so I rushed my order.The only video I found engaging for my little one so far was Baby Signs. The puppet in that video seems to have personality and the vignettes have a touch of humor. In all the other videos, the extremely literal, simplistic approach lacks imagination.I appreciate the spirit in which these videos are created and have used the ""index"" to find the real scores of music; and in this case, the actual poems, which do offer quite a bit of inspiration."
5,Baby Shakespeare,Wonderful DVD with lots of information for my 14 month old. He absolutely loves these movies and actually will repeat what they are saying. I don't feel guilty having him watch these over and over because he learns while being entertained.
2,Buy just one title of the series...,"...to test your child's response...I made the mistake of buying three titles at once...mainly based upon recommendations I read here...unfortunately, my daughters -- ages 2 and 4 -- apparently were so bored with each one that within 2 minutes of the start they got up and just left the room...they're attractive videos but if your child doesn't want to watch, so what?"
5,Baby Einstein - Baby Shakespeare - World of Poetry,"We LOVE all the baby Eistein dvds, this particular one is NEW to us, so our review is kind of limited, but ALL the Einstein dvds so far are so educational & super for young developing minds! Our neighbor's preemie twins have been watching them since they arrived home from hospital as preemie's & learn to do sign language by 8mos. & could say their abc's & count to 10 by 12mos & now at 23mos can READ a BOOK!!!! ALL from watching these fabulous Baby Einstein dvds!!! The music was a great lullaby at naptime!"
2,Yawn Fest,"This was a real let down. I read the reviews and thought that was going to be a great video becasue of the ""host pupphet"" Brad the dragon, and my son loves him. However it was not attention grabbing instead it's very slow and boring. My son just starts to play with other things and normally when these videos are on he is glued to the TV."
4,"Great remixes, but I recommended 7477 for hardcore fans only","Well, I rather would have seen a new full-length album by Funker Vogt, but Code:7477 does have a few good remixes. The first six tracks are redone versions of Funker Vogt's earlier songs (Funker Vogt, Funker Vogt 2nd Unit, and Black Hole), and the 7th track is a new song entitled Taxi zum Mars. As for the remixes, they sound great and have not lost their charm being redone with FV's current sound. They still implement the fast, pounding bass and electric synth quality one would expect from Funker Vogt. The new track, Taxi zum Mars, is OK but it was really meant to be a bonus track so it isn't quite as good as FV's feature songs. If you are a long time fan of Funker Vogt, you should pick this one up. Otherwise, you may want to check out one of their full length albums instead such as ""Maschine Zeit"" or ""Execution Tracks""."
1,Very disappointing,"Projection has to be turned on manually by hitting the snooze button and only stays on for 8 seconds. I thought the point of having projection was to not have to find the clock in the dark. An adapter can be bought at an additional fee plus shipping, which is not indicated when purchasing. Projection is very small and difficult to read. I'm returning mine."
1,Not what it advertises,The clock only projects for 8 seconds when you hit the button. It projects a little red projection. UNLESS you buy seperatly the AC adaptor. This was a let down in a number of ways. Not a worthwhile purchase.
2,Save your money...,"The author lost me on page 4, when he referred to water atoms. Read the Wikipedia article on Chernobyl for free, and you'll know as much as the author of this book. Then find Chernobyl accounts written by G. or Zh. Medvedev and buy THOSE..."
4,Fits just right.,What can I say? Got it before Christmas just like we needed. It was just like it was described. The dolcimer fit like a glove. I guess the only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because I don't believe in perfect scores.
3,Questionable Choices From the Krofft Canon,"If you are going to release a sample collection of the shows created by Sid and Marty Krofft, and you're only going to release a single episode per show, then I would hope that the shows chosen are among the best examples of what the the Krofft philosophy is about, or the most entertaining, or the most representative of the day, or maybe the first episode of the series.But, somehow none of that is true for this collection of programs, a rare miss from the people at Rhino. There is not a single first episode in this group of 13 shows, and many of them are not even the average of the bunch, let alone the best.Still, if you are in desperate need of a Wonderbug fix or need to see Lidsville right away, this will do the trick. Hopefully, like with other Krofft titles: H.R. Pufnstuf and Land Of The Lost, all episodes of all series will appear on DVD. For now, this will have to do."
3,"Daleks, Movellans, and Davros.","The Daleks are back! And, sad to say so is Davros. I don't like the idea behind him, nor do I like his character. His ego pushes the Daleks into the background. They need to be theirselves!Still, this story also brings us the robotic race of warriors called Movellans. Beauty and robotic might in one being. Sadly, this works better on the TV then it works on the printed page. Terrance Dicks never really adds anything to a story, no details, no extras, and sometimes slices it down to the bare bones too.Get it used."
3,Purchased by Price...,"Not as good as the Anolon Advanced pieces we purchased, but adequate for pasta, etc. Love our Advanced pieces. A reminder you get what you pay for."
3,Leaked,"This product comes out nicely and looks good but is hard to work with. I was very upset upon using this product to find out that the nozzle was cracked at the base therefore caulking was coming out of the cut tip as well as the crack and getting all over the caulk gun (I was only able to use maybe half or less of the product since most of it was oozing out of the crack). It was a big mess. So, just make sure when you get this product that you check for any cracks before using it."
4,Finding gold in books about finding gold,"In preparation for an upcoming fulfillment of my dad's lifelong desire to do ""real"" gold prospecting, I researched many articles on Gold Prospecting, visited Sutters' Gold Discovery State Park on a recent vacation to Northern California, and purchased various books on the subject. This book, Recreational Gold Prospecting for Fun & Profit, seemed to encompass the most information and give good, solid advice that resonated through other sources. I've always wondered why anyone would shared their prospecting secrets - but the author comes across as a true advocate. Having been involved in other pursuits (elected public office, karate, guest speaker at PSU, etc.), I have found that the best advice is given by those who truely appreciate the activity and feel that they owe others the benefit of their experiences. Gail appears to be such a mentor to all of us want-to-bes. I would recommend this book be one of your initial sources on gold prospecting."
5,Solid all around information,"Being new to this hobby , this book was very informative and covered many questions that I had. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to cover all the aspects of prospecting for gold."
4,Recreational Gold Prospecting For Fun and Profit,"The book is well written, easy to read, contains very useful information, good references and is conveyed pleasantly. I found reading it informative and enjoyable. It encouraged me to consider Gail Butler's other works."
2,Too basic,All the info in this book is easily found online and very basic in nature. If you are a beginner it's ok I guess.
4,Recreational Gold Prospecting for Fun & Profit,Hey anyone just getting into the prospecting fun should try this book first. First!!! I read it last and I really got a lot of correct information from this one. I really - really like it. Thanks.
3,Decent,"Good flag pole. Gets overwhelmed in windy conditions, but did not break at least. Able to hold two 3x5 flags, but taxes pole pretty well."
4,Good stuff,This flag pole gets the job done. Certainly ideal for tailgating and helping people locate your spot. Be advised that it needs to be on a flat surface so that it doesn't lean into the vehicle as it can scratch paint. Higher winds also cause it to move around and bump into the vehicle. If there isn't a product on here to use as a buffer an old koozie cut in half and doubled up around the pole with duct tape at the point of contact works as a good solution.
4,Good product,"I purchased this product so that I could fly my school's flag when we tailgated. It's a great product. Lightweight, easy to use, relatively compact. The pole DOES give when there is a wind (especially if you have multiple flags on it) but it has never seemed like it was going to break or fall over. In higher winds, I have simply not extended the pole quite so high and it seems a bit more secure. Further, I always make sure the base is secure and that the pole is firmly planted in the base.Overall, I would not hesitate to buy this product again."
2,Not what we expected,"When ordering online, it's hard to know what size you really want. This seemed to be what I wanted when I ordered it, but I was looking for something much sturdier. Definitely a ""get what you pay for"" situation. You'll notice in the picture that the flags are making the pole bend.....I missed that the first time around and the pole definitely does bend in the wind."
1,Product not acceptable,When I ordered this product I thought it was fiberglass as that was what I put in my search criteria. The first time that we used it the pole bent and now we cannot use it. What can be done about this?
2,Flimsy and crappy flag brackets,"When I recieved my tailgating flag pole, the plastic ball that goes on top was broken in the box. So now i just have a pole that sticks up with the top open on it. It also is very flimsy. But the worse part about the set is the brackets that the flags clip into. They are just little pieces of thick wire that wrap around the pole and don't slide or rotate. They scratch the pole when moving them up/down depending on if you're putting the flag pole up, or taking it down. My old tailgate flagpole had rings that went around the pole made out of plastic that allowed the flag to rotate around depending on the wind and it actually had carabiners to clip the flag onto. It was a far superior flag pole than this one. The base on this flag pole sucks too. 2 parts that you have to take apart/assemble everytime you want to use the flagpole. No foldable base like other tailgate flagpoles have.Overall I'm not very happy with this product, but I'm living with it."
4,User Review of der Mond,"Perhaps it is because this was the first version I heard, but this is my favorite available copy of this opera. You can hear the mock discovery and delight in the recitative as well as the sung passages. What is that round light? You can just hear those early teutonics discussing this. It seems to contain just the right amount of playfulness from the performers to accent the presentation. At least it did to cement it into my mind as the leader. Overall, this is quite an enjoyable experience with a late 19th century opera."
4,Excellent for the money,"I am pretty impressed with this guitar, it sounds kind of muffled when you play it with a pick, compared to other non electric, non cutaway guitars, there is no denying that. BUT I actually love playing it and especially finger picking sounds so good and when plugged in, it sounds fantastic."
2,A Disappointment,"Gaudet's book fails to tell us very much about the day to day lives of Carville's patients. Granted, she does relate stories about the Mardi Gras parade and about sneaking off the grounds (I was surprised by the largely positive reactions of the outside community). But time after time, I would read a passage and want to know more. After finishing the book, I hardly had any more knowledge about Hansen's Disease and the Carville experience than I had before I began reading it."
2,Pretty Pictures and Little Else,"I was very disappointed because I expected some in-depth analysis of space transportation concepts accompanied by beautiful illustrations. I got plenty of renderings but they were mostly ordinary and the text only glossed over the concepts. Some of the descriptions were way off base. For instance, the author took the term ""microgravity"" literally in describing satellites in low earth orbit (the gravity in low earth orbit is actually almost as intense as on the surface of the earth).The accompanying CD had only animations and was not informative at all.For a real vision of space transportation, I highly recommend Robert Zubrin's ""Entering Space"" or his treatise, ""The Case for Mars"". They aren't collections of artwork but are more stimulating."
2,Half-decent Overview,"The text is very poorly written and has some technical inaccuracies (like an incorrect explanation of how an electric motor works) but it covers most of the important ideas of the subject. Don't expect much from the illustrations though, they're all basic computer-generated imagery, nothing compared to the incredible Mars Spirit lander animation released by NASA. If you can get past the choppy, dryly written prose and mostly unsatisfying pictures then the inherently interesting conceptual technologies may still satisfy you. The book lacks depth though, and any gems of science are usually too muddled in weird paragraphs to be as gracefully expressed as they deserve."
4,A OK Book,"This book is funny. It is about Jesse and his grandpa. Growing up in Texas, Jesse is a wannabe cowboy - who looks up to his grandpa - a true cowboy. His grandfather is getting old and forgetful; he falls asleep while cooking beans, and Jesse's mother is threatening to send him to a old age home. Jesse thinks that he is fine at home, and should not be at one with only old people. I really enjoyed the book, it was funny and sad too. --Tim Britton"
3,Good YA Book,This is a pretty good book for the teen set. Has a lot to do with learning to fit in and finding out who you are while dealing with outside influences. The storyline about the main character's fascination with a certain mystery writer keeps it interesting and finding out what the mystery writer is like in real-life and not the boy's imagination is a nice surprise. Quick read for teens or even pre-teens.
2,Came in 40 parts,My husband spent two or three days putting together this item. It was awful. Great product for a someone who wants a hobby. I think you should warn people that the table needs hours of assembly work. Not fun
1,Panasonic KX-TG5202M Phones,"This phone system is not reliable. Even though a phone shows its charge at 80-100%, when a call comes in and i try to answer it, it gives a message to place phone back in charger for 7hours. Sometimes it just goes dead. I'm not sure if its a battery problem or a phone unit problem but all three phones seem to have this problem. The last Panansonic model I bought was great for 4years but I won't buy Panasonic brand again."
3,Expandability is questionable,"I bought the previous model (TG5100M) less than a year ago hoping to buy handsets as I need them (I think I looked at ""Panasonic for Life"" logo for too long). However, both the base AND THE HANDSETS are discontinued now, and new models (TGA520M series) are incompatible with my base. So, while both the base and the handset are working fine, the chances for expandability are now zero... Beware!"
3,Disappointing range,"I bought this phone essentially for its announced ""mega-giga-range"" but was majorly disappointed. My old 900Mhz DSS phone has by far a better and longer range.Other than that the phone is nice and sleek and easy to use."
3,Good for daily use - not for formal dinning,I bought this product when it was on one day sale for $34.99. Shipping was fast for this product even though I choose standard free shipping. Packing was good too. I was expecting better product (fine china) looking at its original price tag of $215. But it is not fine china and I didn't like the white/off-white color of the product either. Also wine glasses are of extra large size. I wanted little more sophisticated looking glasses. Cutlery and chargers are fine. This product is only good for regular use and not for formal dinner parties. It is definitely not worth its original price tag of $200.
3,Review for Platinum Banded Dinner Set,"I was a bit disappointed with the quality of the product when it arrived. Some of the glasses had flaws in them, and 3 out of the 4 plastic decor dishes had the paint scratched off. But I just wanted a whole set of matching dishes and glassware, and they get the job done. The glasses are very large and the silverware is sturdy."
5,For those without experience this is a great start.,"Web design has gone through major changes over the years and with the addition of JavaScript web pages have so much more excitement to them. After reading this book and working with examples I was able to create basic JavaScript code and add things to the web pages.The book is an excellent learning tool and easy to follow along with. The title is a Beginner's guide and there could not be a more exact description. The book has the step by step examples and each project has review questions.The book lacks a cd with any tools or examples, although you can get free files from the internet. In updated version this might be something to add. The book takes you from getting the script in web pages to frames and forms.If you new to Javascripting or have a need to brush up on some things, than you may want to get a hold of this book. Overall this is by far the best beginner text I have had a chance to work with."
3,A Professional Programmers Review,"If you are a programmer and you know nothing about JavaScript, this is a good place to start. Mr. Pollock's style is easy to read and follow. His examples, while somewhat humorous, are illustrative and educational. His pace seems a little slow at first, but overall he presents a very cohesive study of the fundamental JavaScript concepts. I would recommend this book to anyone who needs to add a little JavaScript to his resume."
5,This is the one!,"Yes, this is the one book to purchase if you wish to learn JavaScript. It's written in easy to understand prose with excellent examples throughout. At least some understanding of coding Html really is a prerequisite, but you'd have to expect that. Mr. Pollock has authored an excellent text book more than worth the purchase price. Go for it, I'm glad I did."
3,Not the same as the pictured set.,"The picture above is not the exact chess set I received. The board itself looks cheaper and the wood is not as richly colored as the photo. The pieces, however, are very nice; they are felt-bottomed and there are elastic straps to hold them inside the folding board."
2,love makes you do the crazies,"Life couldnt be perfect for the two love birds played by Mark Paul Gosselaar (Dead Man On Campus, Saved By The Bell) and Soleil Moon Frye (Punky Brewster, I Love The 80's)...but after a accident Gosselaar's world goes to hell as an obsessive pyschobitch, Lisa Dean Ryan, wants more then to help and aid him. It's like the Misery for teens. The only thing I hated about this is that Gosselaar was killed...why kill him? That mad me mad because his character was likable and I felt what he was going through and then she had to kill him...argh. Anyway it was somewhat of a good movie fueled down by the cant act Dean Ryan."
4,Prof. Jones a must read for serious handicappers,"Prof. Jones book is a great basis book to use for handicapping. It will help you develop you system, and gives honest, sound advice. (there is another review of a different book under this book I also reviewed, sorry for the mixup)"
2,A flawed handicapping system,"This book is very matter of fact. That's not necessarily a bad thing. It gets right to the handicapping system, with only minimal explanations given for the underlying theory.The book, however, has a MAJOR flaw. The handicapping system requires that have 12 past performances for each dog. For the casual greyhound player (for whom this book is marketed to), this is pretty much impossible. In order to have these statistics, you need to go to the track very often and keep old programs. The only other alternative is a very laborious search for the information on the internet - which may or may not be fruitful.Because of this, the handicapping system is nearly useless for the occasional track goer."
3,Experienced at reading the racing form,"I think this book is for a weekend trip to the dog track, maybe even a week in advance. That is the sort of book it was."
4,Virgin Poetry Reader Says 'Yes',"I have to confess this is the first poetry book that I have purchased and any initial fears that I may have harbored about its accessibility were largely unfounded. Although this is not as immediately gratifying as say, Harry Potter, I found that with a little careful reading and thought, it was possible to share in the author's imagery and enjoy her metaphors and references.Tonya captures interesting vignettes and describes them with the vividness of experience. I especially enjoyed the pieces where her dry humor surfaces or she evokes scenes of New York City, especially displayed in her more reflective pieces - The classic question: Starving artist or 9-5 drone?"
2,Not all all interesting,"Given Button's career, and life in politics, his autobiography is remarkably disapointing. It covers all the usual, his life, childhood, moves into politics, and career on the front bench. But its all written in a colour by numbers style, which made the reading very dry. The lack of clear analysis of politics he worked in, or of the personalities he encounted was the greatest disapointment."
3,Where are the spiral bound journals?,I love Flavia's old style of wirebound journal. Does anyone know where I can get them? I used to buy them two at a time. Last purchase was about two years ago. Help!
5,Muy bueno!,"Too be honest, I am not a 'reader', but my grandmother insisted that I read this book. It was not what I expected...I completely enjoyed this book... because first it was easy to comprehend and the peoples are real. I feel like I know Mary, her Mama, and all the others that come into her life. Her visions are amazing to me: Jesus, the angels and I wonder what Puff Daddy and the presidents have to do with God because they talk about it in the beginning of the book. I especially like how all the coincidences happen. Every time I hear something about shoes I think about God Chronicles. I'm glad my grandmother made me read this."
3,Cute! Purchase your true size.,"These shoes are very cute! Color shown on picture is true to color.After reading multiple reviews on this shoe (reviewed as unconfortable in size) I decided to get 1/2 size larger; because the shoe has side cut-outs, it really allows for ""give"" in the shoe. I recommend you purchase your true size.The back of the shoe is a bit high and rubs against the back of your heel. Use band aids until you feel you've broken them in. I was able to ""break-in"" the shoes in one day. The soles are very slick especially on tile or laminate floor, careful!"
2,comfort,i thought this product was very attractive. i loved the shape and color. but the shoes were very uncomfortable
3,One Stop Shopping for Info on 5 S,Great reference. Its laminated job aid format makes it easy to take onto the manufacturing floor and reference in the moment YOU need it! Add it to your toolbox. You will be glad you did.
2,Octopus doesn't fit,I have a Mares Octopus and it doesn't fit. It is not exceptionally large and I can force it in but then it pops out as soon as I move a little. Will probably give it to someone with a smaller octopus.
2,Complete but not for learners,"This book delivers exactly what the title promises. It goes through Crystal Reports 10 screen by screen and feature by feature. It is well laid out and has lots of screen prints. There is way too much verbiage, at least for this reader.So what's the problem? The book desparately needs examples of how you actually DO some of the things it talks about in such detail. Crystal gives you some really nice sample reports, but they are all finished, not exactly easy to break apart and understand. If this book had some case studies (eg, now lets build the chart report of Quarterly Sales by Employee), I would have found it a whole lot more useful.Come to think of ut, I would trade this book in a minute for something more task-oriented and hands-on."
3,Book Review,"I have to say I'm disappointed in this book. Normally I don't buy McGraw-Hill ""Complete Reference"" books because generally I find them lacking sufficient detail and depth to do any real programming. I bought this book because there aren't an abundance of Crystal 10 books out yet and because Crystal Reports documentation is notoriously bad, but this book has lived up to my McGraw-Hill ""Complete Reference"" expectations. I find the book lacks sufficient detail and code samples to be of any real use for integrating Crystal Reports into an application. Specifically, I'm working with Part II, Crystal Reports 10 on the Web."
5,"All you need to know, and more","I have been using Crystal Reports for years and consider myself an expert, yet George Peck et al have done it again. No matter what you think you know, you will learn something and for beginners, there is no more comprehensive reference than this one. I highly recommend this book, for learning or reference."
4,"Works well, could be better","This remote works well and does a lot. I have 3 boxes and 2 remotes, and they all work together quite well - a pretty amazing feat, I think. You can play songs off your hard drive, off rhapsody, can make and retrieve play lists, etc. The remote is a bit large, but when you figure its basically a small computer and which establishes a wireless connection to the other Sonos boxes, you can understand that it must hard to cram all that hardware in a smaller package - this also explains the price.On the negative side, the remote does take 10 - 20 secs to boot up, which can be annoying. Also, about once a week you have to reboot the controller, which is easy enough (hold down two buttons on the controller), but also annoying. Finally, I wish there were an easier way to search for artists on rhapsody, which I do all the time.Overall, its a nice piece of hardware in a nice system."
2,Poorly Designed Remote,"For an otherwise flawless system, the Sonos Controller is very poorly made. The product is large, bulky, awkward, and a bit heavy, but without the ""substantial and well-constructed"" feeling that heavier items should provide. While the large screen is a plus, the scroll wheel is almost painful to use. Compared to the iPod's scroll wheel, the Sonos wheel almost seems like a couple of vertical and horizontal motional detectors packaged as a circle. The unit often freezes, and only guesswork with random key strokes or a lengthy wait will cure the problem. Battery life is average, and expect to keep it docked (or plugged in) when not in use. I do not recommend this product, especially for its ridiculously high price, but it seems that there is no choice if you want the Sonos system.The Sonos Zoneplayer system, as evident in my reviews of the ZP100 and ZP80 bundles, is excellent."
1,not good,black metal wipes off very easily. I've had it for a week and a half and looks worn out. Not recommended.
2,Nice Watch,This product is nice looking but I had to super glue the pins in. They were sliding out constantly so a little dab of glue fixed it.
5,can't beat it!,works great. i used this to mod a bass amp that has a horn with an on off switch but the horn was nice but too bright this allowed me to be able to engage and adjust to the sweet spot. easy to install.
5,Chotic Centry,"I'm 10,I Think the writter should write more episodes Taking place after the royal cup.other than that make more movies about the Chaotic Centry."
4,Zoids!,"Zoids is one of the best show's ever! And one of the best dub's!I watch it every day and I record it. I record both Zoids and Zoids: chaotic century. I think everyone should watch this. It's got such memorable characters like:Bitt,Brad,Jamie,Doc,Naomi,Llena. And from chaotic century:Van,Fiona,Zeke,Raven,Irvine,Moonbay,Dr.D. It's so great. I even have the Terrace(or pterra striker) and the Raynos. You got to watch this. You won't regret watching this."
2,Not that good,"I'm a huge fan of Zoids Chaotic Century but I'v seen this one many times and it just lacks plot & character devolopment.It might have alot of great CGI action, a great dub, great music & good looking characters but its missing what makes an anime good. Which is of course the characters and plot. The last 3 eps were pretty cool but I get sick of the Biltz team ALWAY winning. I think they only lost once.But hey, some people like action packed stuff like this. Like Spriggan(which I hated). If you wanna just have some fun and watch Zoids fight each other then go for it but if your looking for a good anime look somewhere else, or at least see Chaotic Century."
5,Zoids,Zoids rule!!!!!!!!! I even sacrifice my sleeping time to get up at 5:55 AM even on vacations to watch Zoids.
1,a long time collector with knowlege,"i am a 13 year old collector .i have been collecting for along time even before the us show and this is the worst zoids show ever made.I've seen much much more better shows than this ths sholdnt even be called zoids.the name of zoids is put to shame with its ""lame"" liger zero and abnormaly colored zaber fang and whats up with the redesinging of the models? hasbro made zoids look BAD!!!>( :( |("
4,Love this anime,I loved watching this show as a kid and its still one of my favorites. But i did wish there was more bonus material on it.
5,Grieg SACD,"This SACD brings the listener Three great works of Edward Grieg. The best known is the Piano Concerto. The otherworks the overture "" In Autumn"" and the "" Symphony in c"" are perhaps a little bit less well known, but no lesswonderful works. The performances are authoratative and worth many hearings."
2,Not worth the price,"The pen looks nice. However, the twist mechanism is poor as this does not lock in. As you write, the tip slowly retracts and you have to keep twisting the cap so that you can keep writing. You expect more from such an expensive product"
2,"Extract from &#65533;Books on Bosnia&#65533;, London 1999","General essays on such subjects as the idea of Yugoslavia (a valuable summary by Ivo Banac), Titoism (a routine article by Paul Shoup) and EC policy in 1991 (a short and dim piece by Maarten Lak); this is not a sharply focused book, and contains little of direct relevance to the war in Bosnia"
2,Cats don't seem to like it.,"I was hoping to find good nip for my cats but they don't like this one. I don't know why, they just don't care about it. I'm not sure if it's the nip or the cats. Either way, it gets a 2 from me cause now I have a small bin of dried leaves and that does nothing for either of us."
4,A treasure trove of training evaluation techniques,"Written for Training Professionals and Executives, this book will help you measure the results of training and apply best practices and proven solutions. In the world of Training and Development, this book is well organized and insightful. This book is somewhat technical, and should be read by those who already have some familiarity with the subject. Ford supplies a thorough and insightful overview of measurement techniques and settles on the ADDIE model (from Instructional Systems Design) as a best practice to organize efforts to measure the effectiveness of training. In addition to providing a literature review of most of the popular design and analysis tools in use in the world of corporate training today, the book also has a valuable 30 page appendix including 16 instructional design tools (deliverables)- templates for designing budgets, sample participant reaction surveys, sample test specifications, etc."
4,these do the job - i did see a little improvement,"at minimum they protect your lens - you could buy more expensive ones. a lot of ""pros"" will tell you these don't make a difference in pic quality. I did see improvement and i know that if a pebble or dust came way of my lens - i would rather have to buy more of these then replace the whole device. Take my advice with a grain of salt. exactly as described - packaged well for shipping and delivered on time"
3,Cheap but not great,"I use a lot of lens since my older traditional DSL camera days. These lense are really cheap. However, the quality is not as good. When I recieved it the lens has fog on them. I had to clean it a couple of times befor I can put them on. Otherwise my DSL won't even focus. Well, for the price, what can you beat?"
3,expensive postage,"i bought some filters by amazon because they were resonably cheap, well the postage was three time the price of the item, how can i be happy with that?"
3,got the wrong brand,"got the Merkury filters instead, dont like the Merkury filters, but Sakar has a reputation to them,."
5,Stomahesive Protective Powder,This is a product used by people with stomas--it works--often relieveing pain from raw tissues after one or two uses. I would highly recommend all individuals with stomas to keep the product on hand.
1,Believing in Jesus Means Condemning Birth Control,"If the author truly examined, studied, and prayed about the life of Jesus she would realize that birth control is absolutely CONTRARY to human sexuality. I know this is such a sensitive topic for most Christians that people gloss over it and take the easy path, which is to allow, and even teach the acceptance of birth control; however, Jesus would be devastated at the effects that birth control have on our culture and society. If you want a book teaching the reality about the BEAUTY of sexuality and marriage buy Christopher West's book entitled ""The Good News About Sex and Marriage.""Please, Please, Please DO NOT buy this book!"
1,This Book is Herecy,"A book about birth control? Folks, God has commanded us to BE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLYWhile most couples in the world think about how many kids we can have...WE AMERICANS THINK OF HOW MANY WE CAN AFFORD.The muslims are outnumbering us 6 to 2 on children. Birth control is at it's originof the devil himself. Ever since the beginning Satan has tried to kill the seed of man.Statistically we'll be outnumbered very soon.This shameless blasphemous author is doing the same. And involved in the heretical ""Christianity21"" conference. These are the people predicted by Jesus and in 2nd Timothy. ""Wolves in sheeps clothing""Folks, listen to the authority of the word of GOD, BE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY (God WILL provide for whatever family size you have)I will pray that this Author Repents of this heretical doctrine.God Bless"
5,Meet the co-workers of the Men In Black,"If it hadn't been written before the movie, I would swear this book was a MIB ripoff....A hilarious, well-written book, with a solid plot,Doomsday Exam provides the best explanation I've ever seen for all of those tabloid articles.If you are a science fiction fan, a mystery fan, an occult fan, or just an avid reader looking for a great book, you MUST read this one!"
5,Awesome,This is one of best books I have ever read. The book had me rolling on the ground laughing while enjoining the realistic combat. I hope I can get a hold of some of his other books. If you can find this book BUY IT
3,nothing like the original,"this cd is not all it could be. The earlier work of Juan Gabriel stands out more unlike this one! This one lacks the beautiful emotional vocals once heard in his early 80's music. This is basically a remake of those hits, and revamped. Where did that go? that makes the price of this cd so much less."
4,Basis of late 20th Century British humour,"Ask about any comedian in Britain who grew up in the 40s, 50s, 60s, who were there comedy idols. They all are bound to mention Spike Milligan and The Goon Show. The book has some of their better skits. Very regional in humour."
3,horrible wax but good rollon,The wax sent in this kit was horrible . It was so sticky that i took hrs for me to get rid of it.if the seller change the wax quality included in this kit then it would be gr8 .the rollon was convienient so planning to use other local wax in it.
5,"Great product, but you need to know how to use it","I love this waxer! It does great job, and I will never use salon for waxing again.You need to warm it for longer then they recommend - for 1 hour instead of 45 min, then it will work perfectly. So far I couldn't buy replacement wax roll of correct size, I've got the one that is shorter and warm wax gets inside of warmer a lot - this is inconvenience. You need to buy solution to clean it too, and if wax leaks inside, it's hard to get there to clean.But other then this, I have no trouble with using this waxer, I love it"
4,hot waxer,"I have semi-course hair- and found that this home wax kit is not bad- it does take a long time to heat up-(40-50 min) but it does the trick. I also find that it is definitely important to (buy) have handy the additional rollers and wax strips to do a great job. it is not too bad to clean with some baby oil, a rag-and patience."
3,Works ok,"I came from Brazil and we have much better roll-on waxer systems there, but since I could not find here in USA the refil, I decided to buy this one. It works ok. The strips are not very good. I will try to buy another brand next time."
1,very sticky and won't wash off,"I didn't like at all. The wax is very sticky like duck tape, and when you try to wash it it will not come off with water. I had to use my own wax t remove it, and it was still sticky after I removed it. I used extra virgin olive oil to clean the rest. Maybe if they used the original wax that get washed with water it would have been better."
1,HORRIBLE COMPANY TO BUY FROM,"DONT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY CACHE BEAUTY!! YOU BUYSOMETHING AND DONT LIKE IT, WELL TOO BAD BECAUSE THEY WILL NOTTAKE IT BACK AND REFUND YOU!! IF YOU USED IT ITS YOURS..HORRIBLE SERVICE!!"
3,"the paper not work,like must to work","I took this roll on waxer and I like it,but only I don't like the paper ,like no woirk for nothing.So I going to other shop and bouth other brand of paper."
3,OKAY BUT BE CAREFULL,IT'S A LIL TO MESSY AND SOME TIME YOU MAY NOT FEEL WITH YOUR HANGS HOW HOT IT IS AND IF YOU TOUCH AND THINK IS IN A OKAY TEMP. AND USED IT ON YOUR FACE YOU MIGTH STILL GET BURN .. IT HAPPEND TO MY MOM ...SHE DIDN'T FOLLOW DIRECTION BECAUSE SHE KEEP FEELING THAT THE TOP WAS COLD.. OTHER THEN THAT IT A GOOD PRODUCT IT DOES IT JOB INTENDED IF YOU FOLLOW DIRECTION .
1,"Terrible, worst Risky, HARD TO GET OFF WAX","We tried this product and it was very bad, Hard to GET OFF. Sticky.Clean + Easy Personal Roll-On Waxer 120VClean & Easy Portable Rechargeable Roll-on Waxer"
3,It works ok!,I did like the wax and the warmer works great. The problem is the roller head that is very difficult to clean so I had to replace it instead. The kit works ok even though has a long way to go to get close to the brazilian way!
5,The great item EVER!!!,"My daughter would look at this video from the time she was two weeks old. I would hold her near the screen and she would be in awe.When she got a bit older, she would sit in her bouncer and watch the whole thing. She did this very early. A little over a month and she was riveted to it.She is four months now..and she loves it so much. There is a dragon in it, and every time he comes on the screen, she bursts into laughter!!!I would highly recommend this...only buy the DVD if you can...the DVD will allow you to watch the same scene over and over..(like the Dragon)..or to rewind in an instant.This is her favorite thing to do...and baby einstein dvd too..it gives mommy or daddy a few moments to fold laundry or take a phone call. Love this item."
2,OVERRATED (regarding ALL the Einsten dvd/videos),"Realizing that these are for children... I was still a bit disapointed.1. They are very short.2. Video content is merely shots of toys and puppets. With a video camera and a little training, my kid could have shot these himself.3. Music seems to be made on a casio keyboard or something and not a recording of an actual symphony.My child does watch the video, but for the $20 they charge, it is just not worth it. I could play a classical music CD and let him watch a screen saver to achieve the same."
2,Where's Mozart?,"I have to say my two-year old loves this DVD, or at least certain sections of it, but there's not much Mozart in it. She's drawn mostly to the magic hand inserting balls that tumble down the toy castle and stacking multi-color rings. She wants me to play these sections over and over again. The rest is superfluous.I see it as a highly commercial production, using readily available products, with Mozart reduced to toy piano melodies. I didn't know that ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"" was based on Mozart? But, I suppose if you don't have time to play with your child this DVD may serve as a babysitter. However, if your child is like mine, she makes you sit and watch it with her, over and over again. I'm simply not impressed. Teletubbies has much more imagination."
1,Rather have my child staring at a Screen Saver,"If you haven't tried this product, try it. However, the American Academy of Pediatrics has dismissed as at best valueless. And as For my child, he thought it was boring; then again, no one really finds screen savers that interesting."
1,Baby Einstein - Baby Mozart - Music Festival,"I felt chastened to think I could give a watered-down -sweetened version of Mozart to a baby whoses parents are musicians. Rock musicians at that. And then my classical pianist friend who is also a grandmother said, well what did you expect. This is infant muzak. infants respond to the full richness of the instruments for which the music was written. I have 2 more unopened Baby Einstein CDs. Can I return them?"
5,Baby Mozart,"For a first time user, the process was great. Product was as described (used/good condition). Received timely."
5,The only way I can tie up my daughter's hair,"My daughter still loves this video at 7 mos. The choreography of the music and the movement of the toys is very good. I can understand why it could be mesmerizing. I use it to calm her down when she gets ""whinny"" or when I need to comb her hair and put pig tails on."
4,Unsatisfied Shipping,"My grandson is 2 and loves to listen to this DVD when he goes to sleep. Well, most of the time. It is very soothing and great music!!!! When I received the DVD the case was completely cracked into. I probably should have returned it but I really wanted it to help put him to sleep and the DVD played fine."
2,Not very interesting,"I bought this since I saw my friend's baby being completely hooked on it. However, my own experience with my 6M old son was not the same. He was not intereseted in it at all, I manage to get his attention with the vocab part of the video, but that's only because I was reading with him. It was my interaction with him that got his attention, not the DVD. I think all baby respond differently. For my baby, looking at interesting toys just doesn't do it. He is more interested in playing with me even if it is just one stuff animal only, I can get him to laugh and watch for a hour! I think interaction is alway better than just letting your baby watch TV. If your baby are very into this DVD thing, may be you should ask yourself if you've given enough fun lovely attention to your baby. It is sad if you can't beat a DVD."
5,The greatest thing ever!!,"A friend gave this to us as a baby present, and when we first played it for our daughter at 1 month, we didn't understand what all the fuss was about. But now that she is 4 1/2 months old we (and she) are utterly hooked! She is an incredibly active baby who is always on the move and needs a lot of attention, but put her in front of the video and she will happily sit through the entire thing (actually one and a half showings usually), laughing at her favorite parts and utterly entranced. A great way to get a break when you need it and wonderful for the babies too!!"
3,Typical Baby Einstein,"Nothing new. It's your typical Baby Einstein. With Backyardigans, Dora, Blues Clues, Little Einsteins, and other interactive cartoons, Baby Einstein doesn't really offer anything.With today's technology and computers for families, I almost feel I could make a video of the same caliber that would offer more images for my children to relate to."
1,About as useful as those Dog Sitter DVD's,Very highly overrated... I've seen kids that would be mesmerized by this and I'm glad it works for their parents... I think my child is just easily bored... to be honest you'd keep your childs attention more by throwing on a family video.I'll try the tapes again when she's a little older but for a curious and intelligent nine-month old I'd have to say these tapes are a waste of money.
4,Pretty good!,I have read the reviews for Baby Mozart before purchasing. My son still like animals the best although this will keep him busy for a while. I think this is well made. I won't give it a 5 stars though.
4,"Visually stimulating, not very educational","I absolutely enjoyed this video with my tiny child. It's visually stimulating, vibrant, fast paced and melodious! The only disappointment in this video is that it shows you images of fruits, animals, etc... but there are no words to read or a voice telling the child what it is that they are seeing.I always sit through this less than 25 minute video with my baby and I point out and described these things so that she can not only enjoy watching, but actually learn something at the same time. And we get to bond a little too. Sometimes, she actually moves me out of the way! She just likes to [watch] sometimes too."
4,I like it..,"My son LOVES Baby Einstein! But this dvd, I think because he's a bit older now, was not as entertaining to him as I thought it would be. I should have reviewed the age recommendation a bit more before I purchased it because now that he is 10 mos. old I think that this one is a bit too young for him. He will still watch it though and he loves any Baby Einstein dvd I put on for him (he has several), for the music primarily I think. I will continue to purchase Baby Einstein for him as they have great classical music that my baby loves, not to mention the visuals are captivating to him as well!"
2,Really? this is it?,I have not let my 9 month old watch TV/DVD's before but I had read so many great reviews about this product that I thought I would try it. It sounded like a great DVD to watch and have a little down time while still being educational but I have to say I am pretty disapppointed. The music had a mechanical sound to it and all it looks like a video I could have taped at home myself! All they did was tape toys and had a few very brief scenes with a hand puppet. My son is a pretty active little boy and he just seemed bored with this DVD. I think I will stick to my Mozart CD instead. Not worth the $14.99
3,Interesting Reactions,"My son is now 6 months old and not quite as interested in this video as when he was 3 month old. We now turn the picture off and let him listen to the music, which is excellent, while he plays. This is one of the more boring videos of the bunch and does not keep my son's attention like the others do."
4,my baby loves it!,My baby was about 1 year old when I bought this DVD for her. She absolutely loves it.
2,Not that enjoyable...,"My MIL got this for my daughters who are 21 months and 8 months. My youngest daughter has enjoyed it but seems to be growing tired of watching a bunch of toys being played with - that's basically what it is. My 21 month old runs to it for a second and then run to play with toys herself. (Not much fun watching some one else play with em!) If you want a Baby Einstien video, I suggest Baby MacDonald. It actually TEACHES your child something."
3,Wondering what's next?,The series is very interesting and I'm wondering if more kids videos are on the way. My children are 6 and 3 and like watching these and other videos again and again.
1,I don't understand how this DVD received any good reviews???,"We recently added this dvd to our baby einstein collection and we are extremely disappointed. Not only did we receive the disc damaged, it provides little to no entertainment at all. I am suprised to be saying this about any baby einsten dvd, because we've had success with all other 12 that we own, but this dvd is not worth a penny. If anything, it makes you dizzy watching the multiple spinning toy scenes that last minutes at a time??"
5,Baby Mozart DVD,"Great DVD...my son has enjoyed it since he was 3 months old--he is 16 months now. His appreciation has changed as he ages---where as before he enjoyed just the music, he now enjoys the images. He is now predicting what comes next..Great DVD>"
5,Must Have - Wouldn't want to do without it,I bought this for my son when he was 2 months old on the recommedation of my Pediatrician and couldn't be happier. I buy one for every expectant mom for their new little one. It was something that allowed us to get a meal in while he watched. Now at 11 months he still enjoys it and gets excited once he hears the music start. Great product.
2,Just watching TV...,"If you buy it for keeping a baby quiet while you do something else, fine - though there are other options out there (like Disney videos - at 3 months, my son enjoyed watching bits of 101 Dalmatians!). As for the music part, get a Mozart or Bach or Beethoven ""best of"" CD! My 5 month old loves listening to music, he looks at the boombox expectantly - whether we tune in to classical radio or pop, he enjoys it and it keeps him entertained for quite a while..."
1,Baby Einstein = Baby Crack,"These are awful videos...and amazing videos. We let our daughter watch one of these for 5 minutes and she was hooked. Our normally mellow little girl cried and kicked and screamed when we tried to take her away. If you think this builds your baby's brain you're kidding yourself.However, if you want to put your child in front of something that will keep her occupied while you cook, clean, read, or do other things, then this is as close as it gets to baby crack without being illegal."
2,bOTH KIDS DISLIKED THESE...,"NOT SURE WHY BOTH MY KIDS DID NOT ENJOY THESE AT ALL. I BOUGHT THEM BASED ON THE REVIEWS AND MY 3 MOS OLD WOULD RATHER WATCH THE WIGGLES OR ROLIE POLIE OLIE, SOLD THESE FAST ON EBAY THOUGH.............."
2,Was not interested,"I rented this for our son and thankfuly did not buy it as our son was not interested in either the music nor the video for very long at all. He is ten months and listens to classical music regularly, but the sound from this video is quite a bit more shallow as it is electronic and not orchestral. He did find some of the imagery intersting for a short bit, but not a success for us."
1,You've got to be kidding me...,"What a waste of money! I can't believe these things sell so well. I bought this on the high recommendation of so many parents. I was shocked to discover they are nothing more than footage of toys in motion and sophomoric puppets. I think any child would be better served actually watching a real toy or watching Sesame Street or the baby channel ""Noggin"" and us parents would save our money. But these things are so popular that I keep trying to convince myself that I missed something. Haven't found it yet. My son and I were both bored silly."
3,Music is Good,Along with the other composer BE videos I am not impressed with the video portion and not at all because of the content. I just found that the video does not coincide very well with the music being played so at times the timing seems really off and as a result my child didn't seem too interested in this video but the music kept him intrigued so I believe I'll just pick up one of the C.D.s with the music and no video.
1,Amateurish and Baby Didn't Like It,"This video is incredibly amateurish, and looks like it was created in somebody's living room. Much of the video is just common colorful toys shot under bright lights. The music is synthesized, shallow Mozart, without the depth of a real orchestra. Some babies might like the bright colors, but ours didn't, and would cry within minutes. Teletubbies are free, just as colorful, more varied and engaging, teach some words, and more general social/cultural lessons. The concept here has so much potential, but is unrealized by the extraordinarily cheap production."
3,Okay for the younger ones,"I really like that they use Mozart's music in this video (as well as the Bach & Beethoven videos). The level of ""entertainment"" though is very basic - my son would watch this at 3 months and end up falling asleep or finding something else to do 10 mintues into it. Once he got more active, it really didn't hold his attention at all because there wasn't much going on. I will say it is very stimulating for 1-3 month olds that are just seeing differences in color. From all the Baby Einstein videos we own - my son prefers the animal ones best."
5,These DVDs are great!,My son especially likes when adult hands are shown interacting with toys.Allows 30 minutes for Mom (or Dad) to get some chores done!
3,Scary hand puppets,"While my five month old loves the swirling colors and the baby toys, as well as the music portions of the DVD, the hand puppets scare her to death. For some reason there are quiet intervals where a hand puppet, such as a snake, appears, while occasional sound effects are made. Then suddenly the snake will stick out his tongue and there will be a loud ""Blah"" sound. At first my daughter only jumped when this happened, but now she starts crying. This also happens when the background again goes black and suddenly a spider puppet drops into view, accompanied by another sudden noise. She now views the DVD with a mixture of joy and terror. We rarely watch it and when we do I have to block the TV during certain segments or at least sit next to her to calm her down when she starts crying. And for the record, she is not a skittish child in general. She lives with a large dog and a father who has sudden outbursts during baseball games."
1,A 30 minute toy commercial,"Not only do they start with a promotional message you are not allowed to skip, the whole DVD shows a selection of toys available for purchase - the website is helpfully listed at the end.So... they are advertising directly to our babies now, and making us pay for it by saying they are going to help our children's brains.So, you can take your pick as to who is being programmed.This one's going back. I think I'll try The Wiggles."
1,Baby Einstein is a Scam,"Be a genius, don't fall for the alluring proposition that this will make you child any more cultured or intelligent. There are no studies or otherwise to prove anything that these videos claim.""The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) does not recommend television for children younger than two years of age."" - [...]""The baby video industry is a scam. There's no evidence that the videos are educational for babies, and a review of the research on babies and videos concludes that while older babies can imitate simple actions from a video they've seen several times, they learn much more rapidly from real life.""-Harvard Medical School psychologist Susan Lynn"
5,MY 3 MONTH DAUGHTER LOVES THIS DVD!,Its the only thing she will watch for a long period of time.. the repeat play option is GREAT!
2,Worthless Hero,"Ugh. Who's the hero in this book? It sure isn't spiderman. Recall those stories of people being assulted in big cities in the middle of the day in public and having people stand by without intervening? They're terrible for not helping right? Well Spiderman fits right in! The entire 14 issues are so frustrating to see this ""hero"" basically refuse to do what is necessary to stop the hundreds of thousands of people from being slaughtered by the Carnage crew. I thought Superman was bad at times for not doing was was necessary, but Spiderman has definately took that mantle. Such a dissapointing story and rediculously long. The art was fun and the only thing worth the two stars."
2,Too dated for someone first being introduced to comics,"I had read a few comics recently (Batman: Long Halloween, Batman: The Killing Joke, The Watchmen) and decided to check out this classic. The dated art, simplicity of the storyline, and limited depth to the characters made the book painful to read. Eventually a gave up. I don't recommend this to readers that are new to comics."
1,Mindless,"Tedious, boring, cliche, too-long. This could have been cranked out in about 3-4 issues. The dialog is lame. Marvel is at its best when it humanizes the motivations of its villians, but this is just mindless slaughter. Too many holes in the plot."
2,A cheap attempt to cash in on the popularity of the Carnage.,"This is a poor Spider-Man story. Marvel simply took many of its popular charectars and had them slug it out for 14 issues. If you are interested in Spider-Man, I suggest you buy Fearful Symmetry or Hobgoblin Lives."
4,Great Product! Kinda Heavy.,"Non-stick coating is fantastic, handle does stay cool, heats evenly although it takes a bit longer to heat up than cheapo pans. The only negative is that it's heavy even when it's empty. Add water and you're wishing it had another handle on the other side. It's totally worth it for the quality and the ability to put it in the dishwasher though. Just be sure to use the right detergent."
5,Beautiful,I received these as a gift more than a year ago and they are simply beautiful. The artistic shapes draw a lot of compliments and the stones look expensive.
5,Something beautiful for a beautiful lady,"Once she was what I got her, she told me how great taste I had (This gift made her happy and that made me happy....and the fact that girls are crazy about white gold these days helps too)"
4,Good Book for Sensitive,"I think the book was a good book, but I'm sensitive. If you don't care about anyone this isn't a good book for you. If you do care this book is great. Bran is different and every one judges him on his appearence and doesn't get to know him. It makes you think about they way people are treated. It has very bad stereo types. Nick(the bully)is a typical jock and Kristin(the girlfreind)is a typical cheerleader. It judges the people from their appearecces and careers."
2,Good Detail - Bad Ending,"While Stephane Tolan described the characters and plot very well, the ending was a bit unrealistic. The book was interesting for about the first half, and after that, it got a bit stupid. Some of the things that happened in the book just wouldn't happen in real life. While I can understand that someone can get bullied because they are different, I just dont think that it could escalate to the level it did in the book. I would not recommend this book if you are big on good endings."
2,: (,"I thought the characters in this book were somewhat unrealistic. First, there was the big mean football jock(nick), then there was the ditsy cheerleader(kristin), the kid everyone picks on(bran), and the guy that's just kind of stuck in the middle(david). The teasing and taunting went a bit too far in the beginning, it was good to incorperate it into the story, but there was too much of it. I think it took the book from realistic fiction to dumb fiction."
2,Good moral poorly written,This is an interesting book. It raises many interesting points and questions. Stephany Tolan has a good message but she has written the book very poorly. Her charachters are very unrealistic and stereotypical. I found the message to be forced on you. She portrayed the situations to be very drastic very soon in the book which ruined it for me. I also found the book to be very predictable which made it quite boring.I found her attempts at suspense pitiful and very ineffective. I dont recommend this book to any serious reader.
1,Don't waste your time,"This book is an unrealistic account of a teenage boy who moves into small town America with a ""secret"". From the first few chapters of the book you can mostly assume, if you have any sense at all, what it is. Coming from only one point of view, you have no choice but to conform with the sympathetic way of thinking and the moral is forced on you. I will admit, this novel does have good intentions, but in the end it seems it was rushed and not thorough in it's depictions of an average high schooler's point of view."
3,Very Realistic,"Plague Year was an interesting novel about a strange new kidnamed Bran Slocum, who happens to be the son of a suspected serialkiller. It reminded me some what about how kids today act around people that some steyrotype as ""weird"". That was what Bran was named the first time he came to a new school. This novel mostly deals with Bran's struggles to over come his bullies, and his fears. I would reccormend this compelling novel to people who enjoy real life situations."
2,first half good - second half bad,"A new boy, Bran Slocum was different. He had a secret and when everyone found out about it, it got bad. Stephanie Tolan described everyone and the plot very well, but I just did not get into this book. I don't think this book was very realistic because people didn't act that way then. If this was set back in the 50's it would of been perfect time period. This book had me thinking at the beginning, but towards the middle it went bad."
5,Sparkles and Pierces,"Mark Buchanan is a rare combination. Certain authors are weak in the writing department, yet they do a wonderful job of telling stories and communicating truth. Others are masters in the art of literature, but they fail to touch us on a heart level. Buchanan mixes sparkling words with piercing insight, and delivers a book that should be read by all.""The Holy Wild"" is a book for anyone who has struggled with the questions of life. It doesn't turn its eyes from the ugliness of disease or disaster; it doesn't candy-coat the realities of abuse and addiction. It does, however, nudge us into the presence of the living God, reminding us to view life through his majesty, his justice, and his grace.With the theological depth of CS Lewis and the storytelling ease of John Eldredge, Mark Buchanan is a voice that demands to be heard."
4,Mark is a good and faithful servant,"You cannot write or appreciate what Mark as written unless you have lived it. Pharisees read and don't comprehend the mercy of God and His goodness because they live in the theologian's world of the Institutional Church. Mark touches on the word 'theology' several times and it hit a cord, although I found Mark to be a little too polite. I forgive you Mark for your Canadian politeness.I recommend this book very highy to all who are broken and contrite in spirit and are looking for a cup of water. I have been refreshed.Thank you Lord for Mark's faithfulness and transparency."
4,Bosch Diamond Blade,"This is my second blade, I was installing new windows at the house and had to cut around the stucco as the newer ones were thicker. This blade worked really well until there was almost NOTHING left of the cutting edge. I used it in a battery power Dewalt grinder (DRY)and it performed great!"
3,lasted only 8 months,"I've bought this universal mount for my Nuvi 200 in May, and it was good for the 8 months that it lasted. I've used this mount at least once a week, so I guess the wear and tear took a toll on it. After a while the little ""button"" that adjusts the suction cup would not lock, so it could not stick to the windshield. :("
3,Useful for viewing GPS services on Mobile phones,"I bought this primarily for viewing GPS services on Mobile phones (iphone) along with a dashboard friction mount. This serves the purpose I bought this for and the construction is of good quality. This has adjustable clamps on the sides and the bottom(which press against the phone ends and hold the phone), which can practically hold all the mobile phones on market. But you need to make sure that the adjustable clamps press pretty tight all the time, lest the device should fall.At least for the iphone, the adjustable clamps on the bottom leave enough gap to use a (car) power charger cord. One of the disadvantages though, is that I can use the phone only in a portrait mode and not the landscape (rotated) mode, as the phone speakers get covered by the adjustable clamps in the landscape mode.Overall, it's a decent product that serves the purpose."
3,"Ok, not great","The flexible arm is not as sturdy as I would like, but the product is ok for use with an iphone."
4,"Suction mount is great, vent mount is cheap and flimsy","I purchased this to hold my Sirius Stiletto, and just used it for the first time. I tried the vent mount and it shattered into a bunch of pieces almost immediately. I was upset, especially since the window mount appeared to be straight and have no ball/socket construction to adjust the angle. Once I started messing with it I realized the suction mount arm itself actually bends. It is very sturdy and works fantastically. So I'm happy with the purchase.Also, mine came in black not gray as pictured... I was a little disappointed with that but not a big deal.Overall, I would definitely recommend this product if you're buying it for the window mount and not the vent mount."
3,"Good strong case, still not enought","My first impresionfor this case was that it will good enought for Ipaq 4155, and it would be, it only has one problem which i found in the hard way, this cover leave the upper part of your PDA totally uncored, and in the case of your pda fall down it will be protected but your memory card will flight away, it happen to me and i lost one good 512MB SD Card, my pda fall from about a distance about my knee to the floor ( which has rug ).Now i am looking for a diferent cover for my pda something which cover it all over :)"
3,"Good case, but beware the belt clip","Let me start off by saying that this case fit very well with my iPaq 1945. It leaves all the essential plugs accessable, however it does cover the soft reset button, although depending on how often you need to reset the pda, it may or may not get annoying to take out the pda everytime it needs to be done (And with a Windows based OS, it does happen).Don't trust the belt clip, it fell off the first day I used it, even after I heard the snap that confirms that it is in securely. Ended up bending the case so that i have to unbend it everytime I want to open it. Now I have to ship it back, which of course means I lose the money for shipping. I'll probably invest in a different case since I don't see the point of a metal case if it gets ruined once it falls off."
2,Attractive But Cumbersome,Nifty case but VERY difficult to use the PDA while it's in the case with the front open -- especially if you're left-handed and have normal- to large-sized fingers. There's simply no way to comfortably and securely get a grip on the case with one hand because the front doesn't fold back. I'd recommend Rhinoskin's leather case for IPAQ 1900 Series PDAs (00366).
5,Amazing Live Album,"I have about everything that Genesis has released (and more). While different than the other live releases, 3 Sides Live fits the Genesis live album structure of showcasing current material. This album sounds beautiful; crystal clear while sounding live. The perfomances are spot-on and give added depth and emotion to the original releases.To those who miss One Side Studio. The second Archive Set contains most of the songs from the original US release. It also contains (disk 2) live performances that you will want to hear the instant It/Watcher of the Skies ends."
5,amazing,"I first heard Three Sides Live in the early 80's, when I had moved to the Chicago area, from new friends that I had made.I can't tell how listening to this now brings back SO many good memories and fun times that I had back then. My friends, Tony and Betz had played this so many times, that I demanded that someone, anyone get this album for me for Christmas!! I did get it for Christmas, and it was one of my cherised possessions.Tony died some years ago, but those memories are as strong as ever today.If you like Genesis you will LOVE this, I promise! My fav is The Cage"
2,3 sides live for real please,"The original Three Sides Live album had a 4th side of studio tracks that were brilliant IMHO. The reason I want Three Sides Live is for the fourth side. Otherwise, Keep It."
4,Three Sides Live as a CD?,"Granted the record company perhaps did not foresee the advent of copmact discs when they named the original 2-LP release, but the title is a bit ""off"" these days since they have crammed the entire album onto one CD. The title also presumes that the original studio-tracks side is included, but these days it is not.I love the live material included, since it adds more color to this live release. 'Watch of the Skies' is never tiring, even in this abbreviated form. 'One for the Vine' is a masterpiece, live or studio. The only real issue I would have with this compilation is the lack of material from 'And Then There Were Three.' Why not fit live 'Burning Rope' or 'Deep in the Motherlode' somewhere on this release? The one track from ATTWT was a recording from the Duke tour, so it doesn't even fit with the other live performances from the Abacab tour.I wouldn't shrug it off, since there are some good takes of their music on this release."
1,Bait and switch,"The studio songs that appeared on the original release are NOT on this disk and they were pretty darned good. They hovered on the border of the saccharine tripe that was about to spell the end of good Genesis music but did not cross the line. Having dumped all my vinyl, I bought this disk specifically to get those songs back in my library and got ripped off.One live side is really good (In the Cage and Afterglow are powerful) but the sloppiness of the rest proves that Michael Rutherford can't hang with Steve Hackett. Without Hackett's demanding attention to detail, the band sounds like a pale imitation of its former self. Phil Collins' fake funk ""Owww Owwww"" on Lurker is totally embarrassing. Was he parodying the song because he knew it was a piece of garbage or did he really think he could channel the other Collins: Bootsy?Anyway, this disk should not be sold under the title 3 Sides Live. It is deceptive. And only one live side is worth a damn."
2,"Great... Until it breaks,","I've bought two of these in the past year... Both had welds snap rendering them unusable.The second one happened within two months of buying it. I'm 195 lbs, not too heavy for something like this.Great product, though, if you want to buy a new one every few months but I sure as hell won't be."
3,Overpriced at Amazon,This product seems to be overpriced at Amazon.com. The mini-stepper seems to cost 66.50$ at other online vendors (just google by the name of the product).
3,"ok, not great","I've been trying to switch our household over to ""green"" products, but only if they're as good as regular products. This one doesn't quite measure up. I think they're fine, but I'm not a big paper towel user (I use washcloths or napkins), but my husband is disappointed with the quality of the paper towels. They're not quite as absorbent, which means you have to use more to get the job done, which defeats the purpose of being environmentally friendly. Plus, each roll of paper towels seems pretty small, which means you have to keep changing rolls, which is annoying - and again defeats part of the purpose - saving resources (wastes paper towel rolls). Also, seventh generation should have half sheets like some of the commercial brands do, so that if you have a small mess you don't waste a whole paper towel."
2,What you'd expect from cheap paper towels,"Pros:- Fairly cheap.- Environmentally friendlyCons:- Poor quality. I have gone through at least 50 rolls of these things and never once pulled a sheet off the roll without ripping it (unless I hold the perforation with one hand while ripping carefully with the other). These are not strong paper towels at all. For the price, I'm okay with that and will continue to purchase them, but make sure you're aware before ordering."
3,Ok for casual use,"These are ok, not super absorbent. I use dish towels and reusable absorbent cloths, but I picked these up when my mom came to visit. She's been known to go through a roll per day. She particularly likes to use, rinse, wring, dry, and reuse any paper towel sheet that she can. These fell apart as soon as they got wet, and forget wringing! Needless to say, she was not happy with these at all, but I don't mind them for cleaning the counter top, dining table, etc, that only requires a one-time use. Not really great with spills, and they seem to leave dishes just as wet as when you started drying them. A strange trait.So, they are not for serious paper towel lovers. But I don't mind them for casual use."
5,Wake up Every littel bit helps.,Now you can wipe and know you are helping out the planet! Paper is from trees and without them we are in the poop house. Save a tree!
5,Cleaner Cleaner,"These are cheap, effective, and low impact.I tried using reusable cloth, however I ended up washing them so often that they used more chemicals than just letting the paper biodegrade in landfills. These are very inexpensive vis Subscribe and Save (cheaper than Costco) and use more thoughtful paper sourcing. Great all around."
3,solid,It is a good thing to help the environment. The tools are thin compared to say Bounty and do not tear off as well as other brand names.
3,Good for drying wet hands,Good for drying wet hands and wiping baby with damp cloth. Not recommended for using with cleaning products because the sheets are thin and flimsy.
1,Very Disappointed,"I love buying ""green"" products and recycled products. These paper towels are the worst ever. I absolutely hate them. I would send them back if it was worth the shipping. As soon as they are even slightly moist they fall apart and disintegrate. We don't use baby wipes, instead we use paper towels and plain water to clean our toddler and 5 year old boys. These are terrible for that purpose. Even if we use four or five towels at once they fall apart and are useless. Wiping up spills produces the same effect. If we are using these for dry messes these towels are horrible. I won't buy these again."
2,Just meh...,"It barely expands at all. I was really hoping for something that I could put more than a few documents in, but this may have to be given away in order to get something that will hold more paperwork."
4,"Great organizer, not too strong though",Great organizer with a lot of space. It doesn't look too strong though and is good if you don't carry it and just use it to store and organize documents at home; like I do.
3,"Good Delivery, Not So Good Product",We received this product today at my work place. As soon as we opened the box the clasp on the front where the lid snaps into had already fallen off. It is only held on by a small backer piece inside the file section that had come off. It delivered in a good time and the price was cheap which is why I still gave it three stars but the product itself is cheap and rather flimsy. Not sure what kind of binders other reviewers have been using that they thought this one was sturdy and well built but it is not.
4,"Fine, but coud be improved","This product is fine: it does its job, is sturdy and it holds up, despite being crammed with all sorts of records and documents. It helps me organize my personal records for each year.I wish however that it had little blank sticky tabs so I could write my own descriptions for each sleeve, rather than having to awkwardly pen this in myself. The alphabetical lettering on each sleeve is not that useful, considering that it doesn't make sense to organize things alphabetically for my purposes.This would be so simple to include, and would make it easier to use."
5,Very Strong Case,"The case is very strong. But the tabs containing categories are not necessary useful. I need more room for credit card, bank statement, receipt, insurance and automobile. I change some categories to use them as the tabs for those I included here."
4,Good Organizer,"It does what it's meant to do which is to keep papers filed. I've had some other organizers that fell apart rather quickly but this one is still doing well after 1 year, although I do not use it a lot. So far it's been sturdy enough and makes it easy for me to keep all my important papers filed and organized."
2,Poor quality file,This file is stiff and cheaply made...I don't know how long it will hold up. The file tab markers must be translations from Chinese...they are not very English friendly and don't always relate to my organizational needs
5,Very sturdy,"Compared to the more generic organizers I've seen where the outside is just heavy cardstock, this one is quite sturdy. The black outside is a heavy cardboard and it solidly snaps shut. Looks nice sitting around under the desk. Each partition is labeled with something business-like, although not necessarily what you want to use it for. But you could certainly take a pen and write on your own labels. All in all a nice case, it was nice to get my company's papers a little more organized."
3,Great size and structure,Great size (one of the only products like this for legal size papers) and good structure. My biggest gripe is that i need to dedicate one hand to holding the flap up. This makes it impossible to put documents in or take things out over a stretch of time (works fine if you just need to use it in a one off instance where you put in/ take out a single document).
3,latch is hard to open,"The latch is a bit hard to open. The case collapses as you try to push the button to unlatch, so it's a little tricky. It will probably work better once it's full of stuff. Otherwise it's great. The inside pockets are just fine."
1,DECEIVED,"i WOULD NOT HAVE ORDERED THIS IF I HAD KNOWN IT WAS GOING TO TAKE 2 MONTHS,WE SHOULD BE TOLD THIS WHEN CONSIDERING ORDER"
2,This one is for beginners only,"I can only imagine this book being beneficial to someone who has never used any sort of graphics software. Of the approx 260 pages, 220 are used showing the reader how to use the standard drawing tools and associated functions, that most will find very redundant if they've EVER used Illustrator, Paint Shop Pro or anything similar. The really cool tricks that Fireworks can do, ie. image slicing, scripting, and exporting to Dreamweaver, get only a cursory overview in the last 30 pages. Regular users of graphics software, should probably look elsewhere for a more advanced title."
3,lacks enough information to do advanced techniques,"This book is a decent overview of some of the more rudimentary capabilities of fireworks 3 . But get into some of the higher end stuff and there is simply not enough information to complete the task. It skims over many key steps to do something like, build a navbar."
1,Not a good book to learn how to use Fireworks,"This book is almost devoid of any real help. 80% of the book lists what buttons to click to select a feature. It does not tell you much about when and where to use the feature. It also has no real examples, it just shows menu screen shots, with a list of buttons to click. The manual that comes with Fireworks 3 is 10 times better. Don't waste your time and money. There is almost no content or explainations in the book. Good books give you a good reference source and go through some common examples of how to use the program. A really big disappointment. I don't normally return books, but I returned this one."
5,Love my KitchenAid 5-Ply SS Clad cookware!!,"I own a set and open stock pieces of this, and love how easy I can nest different pieces because of the handle design. Cleanup is easy, and occasional use of Bar Keepers Friend keeps my cookware looking new. [I agree that the inside rivets can be frustrating to clean; I keep an old toothbrush handy for that.]Flat bottoms are essential for ceramic glasstop stoves and thankfully these are flat.Ditched my nonstick and discovered truly versatile, dependable, beautiful cookware when I bought KA 5-ply!"
3,Small stainless skillets,"I am not impressed with this skillet for two reasons: the handle is riveted through, so as to produce two dirt-catching bumps on the inside surface; and the handle weighs about as much as the pan, making it unstable on small gas burners. Apart from that, it performs well. Such items are hard to find; most such skillets have a non-stick coating, making them unsuitable for sauteeing because of the high heat--Johns Hopkins research has recently discovered that high heat releases dioxins from non-stick coatings into the food.Cheers."

3,Felicity Steals the Show,"This is a cute movie that is entertaining enough to keep your interest, but not one that ranks among the great romantic comedies of our time. There are a number of lesser-known bit actors in it (how long has it been since you've seen Bill Dana in anything?), and Nick Mancuso is clearly enjoying himself as he overacts playing the lecherous, famous, and rich Hollywood photographer. But the beautiful Felicity Waterman steals the movie with her charismatic charm. I'm surprised she hasn't become a more famous actress, as her presence lights up every scene (even if her fake German accent gets annoying after a while).The widescreen transfer to DVD is decent, but not great. This movie is worth a viewing, and you may fall for Felicity Waterman, as I have, but it probably isn't one you'll add to your collection."
3,LOVELY LENA,"As you should gather by now, the reason to see this movie, is to see the lovely Felicity Waterman. A stunning beauty. I found this included in a 12 movie set called, ""Big Screen Bombshells"", Quite a bargain. (Amazon, $ 5.00) She sure had me fooled. I was positive that she was really German. I knew a young German girl and Felicity had it spot on. That's called good acting."
3,babe girl on hollywood.,"There's only 1 thing to view in this movie, her perfect and beautiful body. Don't you think so?"
1,Don't do it!!,"I researched and watched the price on this tv for over a year. Finally, Price went below 1000.00 including shipping and warranty. I was thrilled AND THEN TV ARRIVED! Picture is somewhat fuzzy but even worse the screen is slightly concave creating an ever so slight curved picture on some scenes -example -door jams, open doors in scenes are curved, very distracting. At first I thought maybe I had a defective tv but then I typed ""concave samsung dpl 4675s slim"" into my search engine and other posts in tv forums from other dissatisfied people turned up. These led me to Samsung's own website which states that even Samsung FINDS A 1/4 INCH CONCAVENESS ON THERE DPLS ACCEPTABLE!! Well, I don't! Returned this tv and bought a Samsung 5064 plasma - very satified!! Its' true, you get what you pay for!! Very unhappy with this tv, but would like to rave about Amazon's customer service- very helpful and professional!! Handledexchange with no problem. Hope this helps!"
1,"Samsung DLP 46"" of JUNK","Just been a terrible TV. Issues from the start. Spots on screen, 4 bulbs now some type of resistor is turning TV off! On an average, every 3-4 mos something goes wrong. No wonder they are not manufactuered any longer. A piece of junk. $1,200 new. at only 4 years old =$300/year!!"
2,not good enough for me,"regular picture (not high def) was not good - especially during the day.high def was decent but only at nightthe contrast ratio is only 2500:1 not giving you deep enough contrast during the daytimethe screen is also plastic and does not seem to give you a clear picturecould be good for gaming, but i returned the tv and never got to use it for that purpose."
4,White spots problem warranty service,"If you are having the white/black spots on your screen problem, visit samsung.com and find your product page. it lists this exact problem, and what to do about it. if you call samsung and tell them about it, they will send a service person to your house and have it repaired at no cost to you. All it takes is a little research.."
5,Great Buy / Great Quality,"To be honest i was sceptical about ordering this HD DLP in fear that i would receive a piece of junk as far a picture/audio quality. But it has been amazing, definetly a step above our old 30"" tube tv, lol. The clearity is excellent, sound on a 1-10 scale id give it a 5 but thats what surround sound is for, ha ha. The functions are an added bonus. 3D intergration is cool, hooked the laptop up to it and thats pretty cool as well. The unit itself is super lite and the functions are easy to navigate. Shipping only took about a 5-7days. SO all in all...I could not be happier and highly recommend this tv. A buddy of mine purchased the exact tv for $1,100 at Best Buy, so not a bad deal if you think about it."
2,The White Pixels of Death,"Unfortunately, I need to mirror Dominique V.'s review. I don't know if this television is still available for purchase anywhere in the U.S., however, I feel the need to update this TV's relatively high rating to reflect its longevity. I purchased this TV, the Samsung HLT4675SX, in Sept. 2007 after it fell to below $1000 at Best Buy. I was very happy with it until Jan. 2010 when white pixels began to appear throughout the picture. Since Jan., the ""white pixels of death"" have multiplied into the hundreds and rendered the TV all but unviewable. I'll give this TV a 2-rating for the two-plus years of satisfaction it provided me. But to be forced to shop for a replacement TV less than three years after purchase is ridiculous and the only reason I'll need to never buy a Samsung TV again."
1,"started smoking, burning after only 3 months!","I have only had my TV 3 months and Best Buy has already done 2 repairs on it- once for a new bulb and the other day had the whole ""engine"" replaced. Not sure what that means but they told me basically I had a whole new tv now. That was on Saturday. Well, on Monday (tonight) I watched it for about 1 hour when I smelled something burning, heard a hissing noise, and then smoke came pouring out the back of it. Thank god I was home so that it didnt catch my house on fire. Best Buy is going to replace it; we'll see how it does then. By the way, for the short time that it DID work, it had a great picture but narrow viewing angle."
4,Anolon Cookware,Cookware is durable. inner nonstick coating is far better than less expensive types. handles are sturdy and allow easily control when full. definitely worth the money.
3,A SAD ENDING TO A GREAT CAREER,"It's sad to watch an ali with no reflexes,no timing and no speed lose to a journeyman fighter.It's a shame he couldn't have stayed retired after beating leon spinks.His last 2 fights against holmes and berbick really tarnish a great career."
3,"Good companion to the movie ""Cadillac Records""","I read this book before watching the film ""Cadillac Records"". Taken together it gave me a better understanding of that musical era. I am looking forward to hearing Etta James in person in two weeks at the House of Blues in Chicago."
4,There were too many fight scenes...,"I did think the fight scenes got completely out of control. It seemed like the whole book was getting ready for a fight scene, being in the middle of a fight scene, or recovering from a fight scene. If you skipped the fight scenes, there would only be about a hundred pages of story. However, I did like Vikirnoff and Natalya (I'm glad that there is finally a strong female in the series) and I thought there love story was good. There were lots of funny parts, like the flame thrower and the the constant references to horror movies. I wish she would have focused a little more on their relationships. Also, although I love cameo's from past Carpathians, it seemed like the last battle was alittle excessive. There were like fifty people running around in those woods. I did find the parts about the caves and the dragons and the mysterious girl interesting, though."
5,Not boring at all !!,"I absolutely loved this book. I was not in the least disappointed. After reading it the first time I went back and read it again.Christine Feehan is a very talented, fantastic author. I can't wait to read more of her books!!"
3,dark demon,"I am a fan of ms.Feehan, and I really love the dark series. But somehow this book left me kind of...unsatisfied. I never really felt the sparks between the two main characters and the carpathian translations made reading the book tedious. I could feel feehan's excitement over introducing the carpathian language, but I really wasn't that interested. I love languages (in fact I'm a double language major), but I wanted a romance novel. If I had wanted an in-depth language lecture, I'd have read one of the multitudes of text books I already own on them. But all in all I still look forward to the next book in the series (dark celebration.) However, I would have to put this book at the bottome of my favorites list just above dark symphony."
1,same old same old,"I gave it 1/2 a star beause the cover was hot and another 1/2 because the premise for the story was encouraging. Why oh why did I waste my money on this. And I love this series. I'm just so tired of the 'dark' hero who sees the light and then can't fight his way out of a paper bag without his mate. I want to know how these supposedly tall, dark and dangerous types survived for as long as they have when the enemy is so much stronger and so much better organized than they are. If the hero's are really this easy to kill, the enemy should take them down now is what I say. On top of this the story was just plain boring - I didn't mind the hero but the heroine was just a bore, I got tired of hearing her flippant replies and attitude. She had some cool powers for sure, too bad they weren't fully developed. She just lacked maturity in my mind and in no way worthy of the hero."
5,Dark Demon,"I loved this book and thought it was one of best yet. I especially enjoyed the humorous and touching interactions between Natalya and ""Vik"". Their characters seem more realistic to me and I could identify with their personalities, struggles and flaws. Christine reminds us that finding and sustaining a true love relationship is hardwork and should not be taken for granted. Even Carpathians have to work to understand their lifemates! I wish Carpathian's were real because I sure could use one now...sigh. I enjoyed the fight scenes in the Dark book because it made the love scenes much more intense and steamy. I love and own all the Dark series books and heartily recommend them; they are my escape from a too real world. Thanks Christine and for God's sake keep the Carpathian stories coming!"
5,Dark Demon,Christine has done it again! What an awesome story and a hero and heroine that compliments each other. I liked how strong Natalya was and how Vikirnoff (even though he thinks his lifemate should be wrapped in cotton and set up on a shelf like a fragile porcelain doll) understood her feelings and the need to fight for herself. They become equal partners and defend each other from the vampire's and the love scenes are absolutely erotic. I loved this story with all the plots and twists that kept me turning page after page. Christine is the #1 author on paranormal romances and her stories and characters make you feel as if you are living in the book. Thank You Christine!!
2,Maybe if you are stuck on an airplane for 4 hours,"Unfortunately, this book is jumbled and disconnected. A bunch of small storylines looking for a connecting factor. Her ""romantic"" scenes could use a good trip to a thesaurus. It's a bit better then reading the airplane magazines, but not much."
5,NEW & VERY COMPELLING DIRECTION FOR THIS SERIES.....,"Natalya's character contains strong shades of Xena: Warrior Princess meets Merlins Legacy, and spins the Carpathian storyline off in a compelling new direction.Vikirnoff is the usual strong alpha-male, but not drawn as strongly as Natalya. The relationship could also have been more strongly developed, but overall, this is the best novel since Dark Fire, and the new storyline possibilities opened up could result in the best being yet to come."
1,Love Christine Feehan-NOT Dark Demon,"Let me start by saying how much I've enjoyed the Dark Series of books by Christine Feehan. I waited in anticipation for the release of this book, and was not even out of the first chapter before I was shaking my head saying ""What!"". I found this book to be an extremely hard read. It was very long winded and contained more fighting than an actual relationship. When your reading a great story the read is effortless. I found that I had to force myself to finish the book, and the only reason I did was because I paid almost $10.00 to purchase it. The introduction to the Carpathian language and defintions seemed out of place at this late date, and reminded me of another book I had read. I'm sorry to say that I cannot recommend this book."
4,Dark Demon - by Vicky London reviewer for Vampiregenre.com,Dark Demon follows the successful script that Christine Feehan has created with the Dark Series. The two lifemates discover each other and seduction and conversion follow shortly thereafter. What makes Dark Demon more interesting is Natalya. She is a strong woman who can take care of herself. She doesn't expect the big strong Carpathian hunter to save her and kill the bad guys. She also has some very unique gifts of her own that make her a much more fascinating character. Feehan also brings back many of the characters introduced in previous books continuing the story of the Carpathian race. A unique addition to the book is an appendix with the Carpathian healing chants and a section about the Carpathian language. Feehan also includes audio files of those chants on her website. Over all it was a good (and very long) read. The story will be very familiar to readers of the series.
4,guilty pleasure,"This series is a true guilty pleasure.In this one, the heroine is part Carpathian, and a mage, and can turn herself into a tiger. She knows about Carpathians, but Carpathian hunters killed her brother, so when a hunter announces she's his lifemate, she's not particularly enthused by the idea.There's an intriguing mystery about what really happened to her brother, and her grandfather, with missing memories.And what I really, really liked about this was how Vik not only accepted her strength and ability, but loved it. He's still got the instinctual imperative to keep her safe, but it doesn't keep him from feeling exhilarated fighting at her side."
3,Many things left,"I am a massive fan of the Carpathian stories, loving each one very much. Dark Demon is no different eventhough it did lack the connection between Natalya and Virknoff. I did love the character of Natalya but I feel she could've been given more other then just what little she had. If she was from the Dragonseekers then why wasn't she as strong as her neice, or more so since she had three different bloods in her. The relationship between Virk and Natalya was very underdeveloped, but overall I did enjoy the book."
1,Stem Cell Research? Good grief!,"This book just plain stunk. Bad characters, bad dialogue and bad plot (I think, I was so lost I am not sure I ever understood the plot). At the end I actually said ""what the hell"" out loud. Stem cell research comments from people who can change into birds and air and can control the elements? That is just absurd. Also, after this many books, to suddenly be introduced to the Carpathian language feels really fake and lame. I laughed out loud and rolled my eyes often. I really loved the first several books (Dark Prince, Dark Desire, Dark Fire etc...) in this series. They were fun and sexy. This book has far too many things happening at one time and too many gaps in logic."
2,Save your money,"Having read many of Ms. Feehan's books, I have to say that this was my least favorite book. It seems as if there was little plot between the long and drawn out fight scenes and if one has never read a Carpathian novel before this book would only serve to confuse the reader.Was it worth the $9.99 price? No. Save your money and check it out from a local library. You will be glad you did."
4,My Least Favorite,"I have read EVERY one of the Carpathian Series books which I think were absolutely, positively electrifying and sensually erotic. This book, however, falls dead last. I can't really put my finger on the reason. Perhaps I was bored with the many fight scenes with hundreds of vampire clones. Or, maybe I wanted more chemistry between Natalya and Vikirnoff. Maybe their sex scenes were not as dramatic as those in previous books. I rarely, if ever, skip over parts of a book, especially the romantic scenes. This time, I did skip many parts of the book. I'm a big fan, and I raved about her last Carpathian novel. Perhaps Feehan was trying to do something different this time by placing a great deal of the book's focus on Natalya, the ""kick-ass"" heroine. Whatever the case may be, it is with regret that I must say that for the first time, I feel Feehan missed the mark here."
3,Big Disappointment,I love all the Dark books and have read them many times over again. This book left me wanting. Wanting stronger characters and a stronger story line. I agree with other readers that this book doesn't measure up to Ms Feehan's earlier Dark novels. Normally I stay up all night reading her books. This one is the first one of the Dark Series that after reading about 100 pages I put it down and didn't pick it up again to finish for several weeks. I only finished reading it so that I could trade it in (which I have never done with any other Dark book). I hope the next installment is better.
2,What a disappointment!,"I had eagerly awaited this book and have been so disappointed. The writing isn't up to the author's normal standard. The writing wasn't crisp or clear. Some information was repeated three and four times. (eg Natalya wasn't fully human, wasn't fully Carpathian). There is very little romance, and too many confusing battles. I had to read things several time to decipher what was going on. If this was the first book by Christine Feehan that I had read, I would not be buying any others. I hope the next book (series finale??) is better written."
1,Feehan's worst book,"I'm a huge fan of Feehans. I buy all her books and I love to reread them over and over. With that said, I HATED this book. It was a poorly written sci-fi book. I missed the drama and erotic sex scene from her earlier works. It had all the makings for a good read but lacked everywhere. I would not recommend buying this book. And for all of you romance readers I wouldn't recommend even reading this book. I hope Feehan gets it together for her next book."
1,What was Feehan thinking?,"I just started this book yesterday, and have reached 2/3 of the way through. I am so disappointed in Dark Demon that I had to post a comment. The other reviews are all quite accurate... Poor character development, pages and pages of bleary fight scenes, little romance, vague plotline. I really love the Dark series, and can forgive Christine Feehan's often self-plagerized lines and plots, (how many times has she described the male as having a ""beast inside roaring for it's mate""? Or my other favorite, ""her satin and silk skin""?... UGH. Get a thesaurus!) but I am baffled as to why at one point she felt the need to delve into the murky depths of stem-cell research and the ethics of embryo technology. The added benifit of having Hungarian/Carpathian to English translations which appear throughout the book is laughable at best. My advice to Feehan would be to stick with what you know... Herbs, animals, domineering men, and familiar plotlines."
3,Dark Demon,"When I read the first books in the Carpathian Series, I really enjoyed the novels. Indeed, the novels 'hooked' me on paranormals. However, this series began to 'pall' on me when the central theme of the books and the main characters became much too similar. There was no variety in the story lines. Dark Demon is another novel in the Carpathian series and is an example of my comments. I lost interest in the series. Having said this, I do enjoy other novels written by this author. I've just finished Dangerous Tides which kept my interest and is well-written. The Drake Sisters all have their own unique personality and their individual stories kept me engaged."
5,Books in reading order,BOOK #1: DARK PRINCEBOOK #2: DARK DESIREBOOK #3: DARK GOLDBOOK #4: DARK MAGICBOOK #5: DARK CHALLENGEBOOK #6: DARK FIREBOOK #7: DARK DREAMBOOK #8: DARK LEGENDBOOK #9: DARK GUARDIANBOOK #10: DARK SYMPHONYBOOK #11: DARK DESCENTBOOK #12: DARK MELODYBOOK #13: DARK DESTINYBOOK #14: DARK HUNGERBOOK #15: DARK SECRETBOOK #16: DARK DEMONBOOK #17: DARK CELEBRATIONBOOK #18: DARK POSSESSIONBOOK #19: DARK CURSEBOOK #20: DARK SLAYERBOOK #20: DARK PERIL (NOT RELEASED YET)
2,NOT WORTH THE WAIT AT ALL!,"ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT THIS BOOK WAS A DISSAPOINTMENT. IT SEEMS TO BE THE SAME PLOT OVER AND OVER AGAIN FROM THE OTHER BOOK EXCEPT IT'S LACKING A LOT ON THE EMOTIONAL LEVEL. MOST OF THE BOOKS THAT MRS. FEEHAN HAVE WRITTEN OVER THE YEARS ALL HAVE NEARLY THE SAME PLOTTING BUT AT LEAST THE CHARACTERS IN THOSE OTHER BOOKS ARE MORE WELL DEFINE. YES, THE BOOK HAD PLENTY OF FIGHTING (TOO MUCH IN MY OPINION), PLENTY OF SEX SCENES BUT THE LOVE JUST WASN'T THAT WELL PORTRAY. ALL IN ALL, AN UNSASTISFIED READ. NOT TO MENTION I WAITED FOUR MONTHS FOR THIS. JUST HOPE HER UPCOMING BOOKS SUCH AS DARK CELEBRATION AND DARK POSSESSION HOLDS MORE ELEMENTS OF A PARANORMAL ROMANCE NOVEL."
5,Dark Demon,"Ok, I am not a literary critic, but I know what I like. My daughter gave me my first Christine Feehan book and I have been hooked ever since. I guess the only part that gave me heart palpatations was when Gregori lost his hand (that was not supposed to happen!) Every Carpatian in the world was supposed to appear and wipe the master vampire and all his cronies off the face of the earth! (soon to be in paperback, right?) And the dragons......they'll play a major role, right? If you ever decide to make a movie........Ace (from American Idol) would make an awesome Carpathian!"
3,Dark Demon by Christine Feehan,I have loved every book she has written they have all been 5 stars. I loved the story line but the book seemed to be more about fighting then the story. It is the only book of her's I haven't kept. But that being said I will deffantly keep reading her books and I am in the proccess of re-reading all of her other books. Thanks Robin
2,So Very Disappointed,"I have LOVED all of the dark hunter series. However, this book left me feeling like alot was missing, and this book did not seem to weave the characters together as the others have; WAY too much fighting, and blah blah blah. That's how it left me feeling. I hope she takes a break, regroups and comes out with a fabulous book like we all know she is very capable of writing. I was very disappointed in this book. I truly, truly hope she reads all of the reviews before writing a new dark hunter book so she can see how her fans view this latest book."
3,Ties up loose ends,"It appears the series may actually be coming to an end. I enjoyed the book as it answered a number of the lingering questions from previous in the series. I know there will be at least one more book, but it appears Feehan may actually be drawing the series to a close.If you haven't read the whole series this one will not make sense, but honestly I think it is about time as this book continues with the predictable nature of the last few."
1,I'm not buying anymore...,"I have seriously been ripped off with this book. Not only was it confusing, it was boring, boring, boring. Most Christine Feehan books have been great to ok. But this one was just awful. The writing was repetitious, the fight scenes terrible and too frequent and where was the romance? Where the hell were the editors that let garbage like this go out? And what's with the bigger size and 9.99 price? These books don't fit on my book shelf, so I'm not buying anymore of them new. I'll buy them at the local used bookstore and return them. Since I've been an avid fan of Christine's right from the first book, I bought this one and am so disappointed. And obviously I wasn't the only one, the used bookstore would not take this book, they already had too many of them! So, though I'll probably keep reading Christine's books, I won't pay this price again for rubbish, I'll either go to the library or the used bookstore."
1,Worst ever,"This was one of the worst of her series. In most cases, her books are very fun. This one was boring with a capital B. Nothing but fighting throughout - a a touch of the good Carpathian stuff. blah."
2,Major let down!,I was very disappointed in this novel and I am a huge Fan of Christine Feehan. Both of the main characters were way too agressive and I was surprised how overly complicated the story line was.Better luck next time Christine. I'll check out your next one!
5,Great writing,"Oops she did it again!!! Like all the Dark Series book before this is one is as good if not better than the last!!! The stories are just getting better and better!!! I hope they NEVER end!!! Just what one needs to be entertained. To be transforted to a land where ""LOVE and MEN"" are what one hopes they were!!! Thanks, Ms. Feehan!!! Job well done!!!"
4,i loved the complete series==,Christine feehan created a world for me with the dark series-- i enjoyed reading each and every one the carpathians
5,Dark Demon,I have always enjoyed all of Christine Feehan's dark books; Dark Demon gives more insight into the Carpathian people. They call Mikhail the prince of the carpathian people in this book we see why. You get a better understanding of the main characters. The whole story line was exciting and kept you turning the pages to see what happens next.
4,Surprized,"I ordered this book, and since it was on back-order I read some of the reviews here and got worried. I put the book on my TBR pile for a few weeks to work myself up to read it, I was expecting disappointment. I really LIKED this book. The sex scenes were typically the same - I skip over most of them, and yes the dictionary in the back was not neccessary (I hope she didn't pay someone a whole lot to come up with it, because it was useless). But I liked that the other characters where in it too and that it leads into the next book. Which I can't wait to read now that I've finisshed this one.So, if you like the Dark Series....I think that its worth it. If you don't like it then of course don't buy it."
1,Very disappointing!,"I love Feehan's Dark Series and was so excited to get this book that I went ahead and paid eight dollars without reading any reviews. I expected the book to resemble her early Dark books with all of the anguish, passion, and stuggle aganist vampires. With this book all I got was fighting, fighting, and more fighting. There was absolutley no chemistry between Virkinoff and Natayla. The book revolved around the fight scenes and Natayla makes sarcastic remarks constantly while she and Virkinoff are fighting. At first it was okay but after a while very annoying. I would not recommend this book unless you are a die hard Feehan fan with a extra eight bucks to throw away."
2,Hard to get through,I have read all of the books in the Dark series and this was the hardest to read. The author kept repeating herself over and over. I started it on a car trip to South Padre which takes 6 hrs. By the 3rd chapter I was ready to throw it out the window. I refrained since it cost over 10.00 being the over sized book. It said to make it easier to read. Ha. It runs on too long and the plot was blah. I had taken five other books with me for a 4 day trip and ended up reading and finishing them before this one. I did eventually finish it after skipping many chapters. I usually enjoy Ms. Feehans dark books but this one was torture.
3,It should have been so much more.......,"Myself along with all of CF readers have been anxiously awaiting Vikirnoff and Natalya's story. We as fans have waited through the last couple of stories to finally read of their tale. When I began to read Dark Demon I was so excited. Then disappointment quickly set in when I found myself pushing through the book. I just wasn't interested. Same ol' same ol'. Even with Natalya's character being so different, she didn't do anything wonderful. Vikirnoff and Natalya were truely jipped of their well deserved spectacular story. Too bad. I gave the book the three stars for Mikhail's part in the story. The excitement of reading about him were the only parts that got my heart going."
2,Dark Series: Hopefully it gets better,"I absolutely love the Dark Series!!! They make for good reading and laughs. Each has romance and fighting in it. This one, however, had alot more fighitng than romance. The book was so busy with fight scenes there was no room to include a believable romace between the main characters.It is nice that she has independent women characters, but too independent is a bit much. This makes the relationship between the main characters hard to believe.I have only two questions.WHERE did they get the swords or rods used in this book in every fight scene? Not a good idea.Why are all the latest books about characters that have never been mentioned before. Some of the Secondary charcters would make wonderful stories of their own in tis series.As I said before I loved all of the Dark books except for this one. A little less fighting and alot more loving would go a long way with readers."
1,Why oh Why???,"First off I am embarrassed to be seen reading anything by this woman because I am sure all the sensible people have written her off and will laugh at me. This book was no exception, I tried reading this one while waiting for an appointment. It was so bad that I excused myself to the bathroom and trashed the book amongst the paper towels. I couldn't even get passed the first chapter(which is usually where she puts all her effort).She needs proof reading and someone to give their very honest input. I can't believe her publisher lets her go on and on and on. It is a travesty to all literate people everywhere that this woman gets published."
3,"not the best, but funny in it's way.","A lot of people are saying that this isn't her best effort and the book isn't worth it, although I agree to some extent, it was still a fun way to pass the time on the bus too and from work. Don't expect magic, the most amazing book ever or perfection. It was cute, it brought back a lot of former characters and the heroine is sassy and modern."
4,great story,I loved the storyline and the way it keeps you wanting to keep reading. The romance gives the plots an unexpected twist.
4,Loved This Book,I found this book to be a very enjoyable read. The characters are well developed and I liked the heroine very much. You won't be disappointed!
5,"The Perfect First Mate is a ""perfect"" book for all boaters","The "" The Perfect First Mate"" is an exceptional written guide that benefits new and existing boaters. It is practical, up-to-date, and has great ideas for making boating life enjoyable and easy! I also appreciate the subdued humor throughout the book. I recommened this book to any boater who wants to spend more time enjoying boating, and less time with worrying about the ""grunt work""."
4,"Useful, but more towards weekend yachting.","I brought this book to help me understand how a woman feels about cruising, but found the orientation more towards weekend and holiday sailing.That said the author offers some real insight into what is important to a woman on a boat."
5,INTERTAINING AND INFORMATION,"An intertaining, but informational book, written by a woman with a great sense of humor; someone I'd love to meet."
2,so much to be desired,"Although I loved the title, this book is full of inconsistencies, bad information, and a bunch of poor writing. Save your money and put it into your boat."
2,Cheaply made w/ design flaws.,"I've been using these crepe pans for a little over a month, for once-a-week weekend crepes. After about 4 times use the non-stick coating on both pants began chipping, and voila my crepes consistently stick and burn to these spots.Secondly, while the handle was meant to be designed as a cool handle on a hot pan, the hardware bolts on the bottom of the handle get scorchingly hot and burn your fingers consistently. I thought that I'd get used to grap the handle in a certain way to avoid burns, but I have not used it often enough to remember. And now with the non-stick chipping away, looks like I'm not going to.SAVE YOUR MONEY, BUY A BETTER CREPE PAN!"
4,Good for those new to sales,"This was a short book, about 130 pages and I read it in 2 days. people who are new to sales will enjoy this book, but as a veteran who reads loads of sales books, there really wasn't anything eye opening. Every book you read though does give you a little something to help you improve.Ty WildeAuthor of ""Everything I touch Turns to Sold"""
2,This book not helpful to me,I didn't find this book helpful to me as a new telesales person - maybe it's because I don't do cold calling - the calls come to me. I ended up skipping over several chapters because they were not applicable to me at all. Maybe it is more helpful to others.
4,A Must for sales people,This book offers more insights on how to establish a sales career...and is a good reference to go back to again and again.
3,Very Basic - Just OK,"A quick read, with 25 very common sense ""Sales Habits"" that will probably be second nature to all but the most novice salesperson. Don't get me wrong, the book itself is fine - just that there is nothing here that is all that new, earth shattering or even revelatory. As an example, one of the strategies is ""Ask for referrals"". Or this gem, ""Engage the prospect"". Again, the information is fine, and the refresher on the basics, or even for a new salesperson might be beneficial, but there just isn't enough here to either engage the reader or to really open any new ways of thinking. Just OK..."
3,Not Really Geared Towards Retail Sales,"I read this book thinking I would pick up some tips in the retail sales arena. I was mistaken. There are some really great points, don't get me wrong. This book is geared more to anyone selling anything other than retail. I'll keep it around for if and when I change arena's. It's a definite must read for any other sales professional."
3,A Succinct And Easy-To-Read Book On The Basics,"The 25 Sales Habits of Highly Successful Salespeople is a concise book on how successful salespeople go about their profession. The 25 'habits' are quite basic and hardly represent a revelation to anyone but the most novice of salespersons.Nevertheless, the 130-odd pages can be a fast and quick review, or check list if you wish, for anyone interested in covering the basics.The book's title might or might not be referring to Steven Covey's famous series. Either way, The 25 Sales Habits can apply to more than just salespeople.Pro: A quick read with a quick reference summary at the end.Con: Too basic for most and a partially dated entry in the ocean of sales collateral designed to launch a training career."
4,Schiffmans' 25 Sales Habits Book Is Very Useful,"The best thing about Stephan's 25 Habits book is that it summarizes what it takes to be a successful sales person.It's easy to read, and even when you're an experienced sales pro like some of us grizzled old veterans are, you'll still find that there's things you could improve upon in what's explained.. so it's a great ""self check"" and tune-up, for all levels of sales reps.Schiffmans' books (and Gitomers) are ones that I recommend all my clients read, as they're important, and their techniques work.This one is useful, a good overview and primer of what sales success is all about. Nice work.Ken Calhoun"
5,I thought the book was powerful.,Sales is a profession where motivation is essential. The biggest problem that professionals encounter is their own negativity. This book is inspirational. It reminds you to challenge yourself.
1,A real yawner,"I am not a negative person, however I do have some negative feelings about this book. I have what I consider ""moderate"" sales experience, selling everything from shoes, to real estate, which is my current profession. If you are looking for a book that gives you practical, applicable advice, this is not it. It is more of a feel good, hey heres a few ideas that may help you in general type book. Basically a lot of mush. I found myself having to sell my own self on even finishing the end of the book. I made it, but my eyelids were heavy and I was totally uninspired. I am truthfully surprised that this book has recieved such positive reviews. In summary, it was a book of broad, unconnected ideas that will have little to no effect on actual sales performance or customer satisfaction."
1,Now I know why it's only $6.95,"This booklet (is it really long enough to be considered a book?) is in its 3rd Edition, but seems to be full of sales techniques from 20 years ago. The author lost me before the book even started when he writes about making 15 cold calls every day a key habit. Most of the 25 Habits + 5 Bonus Habits are very basic. Each ""Chapter"" is way too thin. 2 pages does not a Chapter make.I too was fooled into thinking this book was related to the Stephen Covey ""7 Habits of Highly Effective People"". If you're new to Sales and need a primer on the absolute basics, then this book is for you. Otherwise, there's a dozen better books out there."
2,Very Short on Depth and Power,"Look, in all honesty this little book was a light and easy read; it made some good suggestions on what habits (or actions) a salesperson should make to become more successful... however, it's brevity translated to simplicity and lacked depth or power. Sure, I might suggest it to a person absolutely new to sales or just wanting a primer or quick read... beyond that, look elsewhere."
2,"Very BASIC, not Happy","I remember a very popular book ""7 habits of highly successful people""I thought this was the same book but 25 habits for salespeople.It was a clever title that would lead you to believe you are discovering little known secrets. This book I read in about 20 minutes. I skipped all the explanations/examples because the concepts are so basic they do not require further explanation.I found this very disappointing."
4,Great read!,"A good common sense review of salesmanship. The book reinforces the habits that a good salesman must have and how to use them. I used some of the habits to discuss in our sales meeting and reinforce the ideas with the sales reps. Unfortunately, in todays market, price seems to be the only method of winning business, this book gives us hope that good salesmanship is still required and valued."
1,Weak,There are so many better books on the market and this is quite frankly unimpressive. If Schiffman is a good salesman he does not demonstrate it. I had phone interaction with him once and found him to be obnoxious. The only good thing about this book is that it doesn't cost much.
4,Great skillet,"I've owned this skillet for about 2 years now. It's a VERY sturdy, heavy-duty pan, it heats evenly, and produces good results. It's big, and works very well in the oven. I've washed it in the dishwasher, but mostly hand-washed it. I've only used plastic utensils on it. So far, I've never had to use cooking spray or any other grease, though I often use olive oil or butter for taste anyway. But, things are starting to stick to the pan. I would've given it 5 stars, but the non-stick durability wasn't as good as I expected. It's still a great skillet, and I plan to use it for years to come, but will use it less for foods that stick."
3,Could be fresher,"Catnip needs to be carefully cultivated (I read) so that other plants do not creep into the field. Also, it must be fresh to really get the cat to respond. My beloved cat did not react as I expected; truly effective catnip has a narcotic effect on susceptible cats, putting them in a spell almost. My cat could take or leave this catnip unless it was really laid on heavily."
5,"Jose Hernandez, He's The Man!!!",Jose Hernandez is brilliant in the album. I have no words to describe how well he interprets these songs. A must have in your collection!!!
1,It's a YAWN!!,Got this CD today and I am disappointed with the number of songs and the songs in general. Not even the artwork on this CD is exciting or innovative. I think I might have to listen to this CD a hundred times or so to get used to it. I've heard them do better and maybe Jose Fernandez should stick to songs others have written. I am disappointed and had hoped for better out of them.
1,"What the heck is this item? Is it a book, a thingamajig? What?",I was looking for alternative energy items and came across this picture of a man holding a piece of what looks like mat. What is the item being sold? I can't tell - can you?
4,The blood washes us clean.,"After merely one listen you'll understand once and for all that there is no way to confine HASTE to a single genre of music. ""The Mercury Lift"" is an album for lovers of all true alternative music (hardcore, metal, punk, emo) - and it mixes them all together to create a sound like no other out there today. And while the album features outstanding co-lead vocal cameos by Jeff Jenkins (Codeseven) and D. Randall Blythe (Lamb of God) it's the band themselves that have stepped things up to a whole new level this time around. That goes for a superior performance, vastly improved production and mixing, tighter song arrangement and everything in-between. It's easily their heaviest release to date while also being their most accessible - that's what happens when you push yourself to grow and become a better band. HASTE made the record they needed to and ""The Mercury Lift"" will easily reign as one of my favorite albums of the year."
1,Hyped by some hypes????,"I can see how some people find this album interesting maybe. I honestly tried to get into these guys myself but, I find the guitars boring, vocals okay. This guy kind of screams like a tool. In all honesty if you like borderline easy listening music then by all means go spend the money. If you prefer something a little more upbeat then guy buy some good metal. I think I was tricked into buying this by the first track. The worst thing you could possibly do is buy this CD and make yourself like it by trying to convince yourself in a review that it's good. Not my cup of tea."
1,Haste=waste,"Thats Right, not just because it rhymes but because this album does indeed suck. I heard one song on this album before I got it and it seemed decent. However I was unpleasantly surprised when I found that it is mostly emo garbage with some weak-ass screams mixed in here and there. I think that this band is way overhyped. Spend your money on the new Killswitch engage or something other than this god-awful B/S!!!!"
5,An Excellent Display of KISS photographs...!,"Chip Rock's Outtakes displays excellent photographs of KISS in their heydays. By seeing those glorious photos... you will feel like you were there, watching historical moments of KISStory being made. Many of die-hard KISS fans might already have the KISSYEARS photobook by Barry Levine that focus on the Destroyer/RARO and Elder era. Well..., Chip Rock's Outtakes gives you outstanding KISS photos from different era. This book will compliment the fine moments of KISSTory where other books left off. This a MUST for all KISS fans."
1,I have seen MUCH better,"Chuo Rock is one of those photographers who managed to get close to the stage, and when he did he took sub-standard pictures when he got there.Underexposed, overexposed, blurry...you name it Chip took it.Save your money, there are MUCH better KISS books out there."
2,An opportunity missed,"I bought the book as an aid to buying a rifle sight and perhaps a set of binoculars. I thought that it might consist of a series of product reviews - sort of best buy at this price, best buy at this (higher) price etc. It was not!A series of articles discussing the reasons for good optics, binos and rangefinders/spotters was very interesting but this was followed by a somewhat out of date comparison chart of various scopes, binos and rangefinders etc. It was not all bad but the opportunity to produce a really cutting edge series of reviews was missed (in my opinion) Pity because the author obviously knows his stuff!I could not honestly recommend this book as a way of selecting a scope but could recommend it as a book which would tell you about the reasons why you should have a good scope/binoculars or rangefinder/spotter.Good in places but no cigar!"
1,Amazingly uninformative & chock full of da basics.,"If you didn't know that an 8x56 scope provides a larger magnification and brighter image than a 6x26, this book is for you.However, if you expected comprehensive product reviews or comparisons, fugedaboudit. Want to know whether a scope has 1/8MOA clickstops or 1/4MOA clickstops? Fugedaboudit. You will get tube diameter, magnification, ojective lens diameter, parralax adjustment, exit pupil diameter, eye relief, field of view @ 100 yd, length, weight, and MSRP. Who needs more information to decide whether the $2000 scope is really better than the $250, or more importantly, how the various scopes in the $250-600 range compare."
1,HELPFULL IF YOU ARE BUYING A SCOPE,"I bought this book to compare the different products out on the market. I was mainly interested in a rifle scope, but the sections on binoculars and spotting scopes looked complete to me. What I got was a comparism of scope prices, features and specs. I felt this really helped in making my choice. THe scopes were divided into sections for varmit shooting, dangerous game etc. About the only thing I could say is that there are no street prices listed but admitedly this is tough to do because there always is a lower price out there.All in all a great investment for below 25 bucks."
3,bent blades but still works,"I was rather distressed when this arrived and the blades were somewhat bent (see my customer photo), but I gave it a try anyway because I figured it has got to work better than the ""two knife"" method I had been using to cut butter/shortening into my pastry dough for several years now.Although I found the handle to be more awkward than ergonomic and I had to stop a couple of times to scrape off the excess dough creeping up the outside of the blades, I must admit this thing cuts in butter like a mofo...I was done sooooo much faster than before. I used a rather deep but somewhat narrow bowl for this, and I think a wider, shallower bowl would work better.Overall I am satisfied with this dough blender, but I thought people should know that the blades may be bent."
2,NOT ALL AUTHENTIC BASQUE RECIPES,"I bought this book when it first came out and was so happy to see a book on Basque cooking (there are so few written in English) and I was also influenced by all the 5 star reviews on this site. Well, after reading it carefully and preparing several recipes I feel let down. Not all the recipes are authentic Basque dishes - many are traditional Spanish dishes. Several recipes were quite bland and I can only imagine that you'd have to import the ingredients from the Basque country in order to get the results that Ms. Barrenechea describes. I am very dissapointed in this book and can not recommend it."
5,An impressive collection of master-chef level recipes,"The Basque Table: Passionate Home Cooking From One Of Europe's Great Regional Cuisines is an impressive collection of master-chef level recipes compiled by Teresa Barrenechea and arranged with the assistance of Mary Goodbody. Basque cuisine is an amalgam of diverse culinary influences including Tuscan, Sicilian, Burgundian, Provencal, and Spanish. From Pincho de Bonito Picante (Spicy Tuna Pinchos); Txangurro Donostiarra (Spider Crabs Donostia-Style); and Solomillo de Buey con Pimientos Rojos (Grilled Filet Mignon with Roasted Red Peppers); to Codornices in Salsa de Chocolate (Quails in Chocolate Sauce); Trucha a la Navarra (Trout Navarra-Style); and Higosy Brebas con Natillas (Figs with Natillas), The Basque Table offers exotic, palate pleasing dishes that are deliberately designed and presented so as to be thoroughly ""kitchen cook friendly""."
2,I agree with Mr. Angel Ibañez de Aldecoa,I do agree with Mr. Angel Ibañez de Aldecoa. I have been to her restaurant in New York and with great sorprise I found in her menus one of my favorites recipes whose owner and creator is one of my best friends in Madrid. She should be very careful about taking recipes from real chefs or at least recognice who the creator of the recipe is. I think this book has a wide range of recipes but some of them are Spanish and not exclusivly from BASQUE COUNTRY. I think the book could be better if she were a real professional chef with great experience.
5,The book of the year!!!,This is the first time that a compilation of these great recipes are available to the public. Highly recommended.
5,Delightful recepies. Written exquisitely.,For all those in love with Basque food...this is the definitive book! Ms. Barrenechea takes you on a delightful tour of the most exquisite recipies from this rich region of Spain. Highly recommended.
3,"Good, but by no means the best.","The book is a very simple and unsophisticated introduction into the vast and rich culinary Basque tradition. It does little justice to explain and educate the reader on the origins, history and meaining behind the Basque countries intimate relationship with food. Before reading this book, treat yourself and actually visit the Basque Country in person and you will then trully understand what Ms. Barrenechea is trying to portray."
5,Best cookbook in my collection,"This is without doubt the best cookbook in my collection and I have about 50, many award-winning. When you look at the recipes it's hard to see what's so special about them, but the short ingredient list contains a perfect balance of simple flavours that delights every time. You can work your way through the book page by page, particularly as it's quite short so not intimidating, and be happy every time you cook from it. As someone who has lived in France and Italy, I think Basque cuisine is quite different from any other and my favourite"
2,Marginal Text,"I used this book for a college-level linear algebra course and found it marginal. Although the author is clear, he skips steps and does not provide ANY answers to exercises in the back of the book. Sometimes you can find the answers to exercises in proofs contained in subsequent chapters. You really need a good professor (which I thankfully had) to get the most out of this course and book."
3,"Solid text, but not the best I've seen","This book is a good linear algebra text written in Lang's usual clear and thorough style. However, I prefer Gilbert Strang's book Linear Algebra with Applications."
4,A solid text,"This book is good for an upper division undergraduate mathematics course. I am a UCI student as well and this text is clear and to the point, as a good math book should be. I couldn't agree with the previous reviewer more that this is a bridge from computational cookbook math courses like calculus to the ""real"" mathematics and abstraction. Anyhoo, this text was good, especially the chapters on scalar products."
1,Poor formatting and full of errors,"This is not a review on the content but on the presentation of this ebook. It is full of formatting errors. Even worse, mathematical formulas are wrong in places due to incorrect formatting. Obviously this ebook must have been produced using an automated process with no proof reading. This is utterly unacceptable, especially considering that the ebook costs almost as much as the print version. Verdict: useless."
2,Poor Quality Control,"Apparently I didn't learn from my experience when I bought the lathe. PSI made good when the first lathe they sent me died immediately with a puff of smoke. For this I give them credit. There is a lot of play in the fit when you mate the extension to the lathe bed. That is just a little annoying. In order for the tailstock to slide off the bed and on to the extension, I had to dress the channel from end to end. Likewise for the tool rest. The screw holes lined up, and that's about the only thing that fit properly. This last is the really annoying part. After much fiddling around, I have a functioning, if underpowered, lathe."
2,Be aware,Be aware that this specific item do not has neither the illustration guide nor the illustrations.Iam calling to amazon because I ordered based on the pages I was able to see on line but the book I got is not the same.
5,Rare Italian Medieval Sacred Work,"Marina Malavasi directs Ensemble Vocale Dodecantus, featuring soprano Laura Fabris, and Consort Veneto in a recording of Laude Libro Primo by Innocentius Dammonis (b.1460).The works on this recording:1. O stella matutina2. Humilmente t'envocho3. Maria, madre de Dio4. Fuzite christiani5. Non tardati, peccatori (anonymous)6. L'amor a me venendo7. Laudiam l'amor divino8. Gaude flore viginali9. Ave fuit prima salus (anonymous)10. Maria del ciel regina11. O Croce alma, mirabile12. Madre che festi13. O Jesu dolce14. Peccatori, perché seti15. Cum jubili d'amore16. Maria, misericodria"
3,Average,This book has lots of ideas in it and it written clearly and concisely... However I know many of the ideas that are in the book so it was only an average help to me... If you were giving it to a child as a present it would be great :)
2,Overpriced and uncomfortable,"Looked promising since it is made from recycled materials. However the design is bad:1) The seat is hollow and kids hate to sit in/on it, hurts their bottom. We have to put a pillow in it to fill up the seat. Saw similar tire horse swings at the local hardware store for half the price, (yes taxes but no shipping!)that have a rounded (convex) seat. Have to look into altering the design.2) The stirrups are way to small to fit even the smallest feet, and are useless.3) The rubber is made shiny with a product that rubs off on clothes and is hard to get off."
4,Will prob last 20 years...,Easy to finish with the sizing etc of the rope etc. Will prob last 20 years plus the way it is made.
2,blah blah blah,This is good for a source of field recordings but its pretty boring music really. Just sounds like a bunch of people making weird sounds.
5,great pan,"One of the best I have ever used.Very easy to clean and not too heavy, compare to some of the other ones I had in the past. It is not light though, my wife does have trouble handle it using just one hand.NO lid.for the past month, I am truly happy with it. my sisiter has a similar one for about 2-3 years and it is still going strong."
2,Not what I was expecting,"When I first opened the packaging, I realized that the stir fry pan was very shallow and is only fit to cook for 2 people. I only wanted a 12"" but expected it to be deeper than this. This is just a glorified frying pan.This product was made in China, as is a Calphalon 10"" nonstick pan I bought on Amazon as well. The quality of the material doesn't even come close to their counterparts made in the USA, even though it is the exact same item. The nonstick sometimes is either too slippery or doesn't work at all, meaning the food still sticks! This pan is extremely heavy, and overall, doesn't work better than my old wok that I got for $30.I thought it was a steal to buy something brand name from Amazon at more than half off. In cookware stores, you really do see them advertised for the full price... However, they are usually made in the US and you can tell the difference right away. Here it's made in China. You usually get what you paid for, and in this case, too much."
5,great stuff,If you don't eat enough greens in your diet this is a great supplement to take. Gives you energy as well.
2,Not like original - Mark Tiedemann is no Robert Silverberg,"I really can't read this book. The text does not flow like Asimov's books. It reads like something else. It is a littlke too fast paced, with too little dialogue and I think there is not enough reflection on the background and the possibilities.The basic premise has got something wrong with it. It's not tied in too well to other things.If Asimov would use any of these ideas,he would offer some explanation. Asimov also, by the way,often had some short third person narration interspersed inhis books and this is totally missing.Robert Silverberg expanded a few Isaac Asimov stories into books and he did it in keeping with Asimov's style. Robert Tiedemann is no Robert Silverberg. If Asimov had been alive, I don't thinmk he would have approved of this, except if he decided not to careI give it two stars because at least this is a try. Also, I only have this book,not its predecessor."
5,Music from the Danish Jungle,"Welcome to the Jungle! Guns N' Roses in Denmark! Well - not really. Why this CD is called this on Amazon, I don't know. Actually, it is a CD of the works of the Danish Composer Otto Malling - who no one heard of today, but who, back in the day - in Denmark - just might have been as popular as Slash! These are tone poems based on Biblical themes - straight from the bible - The Conversion of Paul and the Seven Last Words. Danish Jungle Music indeed!"
3,"thick, sturdy attractive, but the mold seam is far too noticeable","these would be perfect if it weren't for the seam from the mold down the side of them, I have seen this in other libbey glasses. With the mugs being heavy in nature and your hand will always be resting/pressing up on the handle that seam will be irritating, atleast it is for me. maybe I just got a bad batch..."
1,Arrived broken,"I can hear the broken glass sliding around inside the box. No need to open it.I had the same problem with another glass item I purchased, which I re-ordered because Amazon will reimburse me for the return shipping. The other item arrived today intact, so now I'll take a chance on re-ordering these, hoping for the same good fortune! I'll update later with the results.Update: I decided to buy the mugs in a local store rather than re-order them. I need them right away. Oh well..."
3,"Beautiful puzzle, Hard work",I first bought this puzzle because it reminds me some about Disneyland. The piece shapes however are geared toward mid to expert level puzzle fans. I could not finish it. I might wait until I have become more expert before buying another Sunsout brand puzzle.
2,This is 1964?,"It is always disappointing when you receive a DVD that isof such low visual and audio quality, even by 1964 stand-ards. This concert is so blurry, it is hard to look at.I am such a fan of these musicians, I tolerated it. Theclose-ups are a little better, but this is very poor. There is a second concert from Brussels, two years earlieron this DVD. I was ready to write off this DVD as a totalwaste of money, until the Brussels segment started. Thisperformance is sharper, has better audio, and wow!, thisperformance has Coleman blowing hard, in top notch form.His accompaniment is equally impressive. This part savesthis DVD from the scrapheap."
2,Disapppointed,The Man ist right. Lousy picture and sound quality. I should have read his rewiew before bying the DVD. Don't make my mistake !!
3,"Long time Keen Lover, but...","Greetings form a Keen fan. I was so excited to have finally gotten these shoes and in the orion blue, but they literally cut into my heel - achilles tendon area - not cool. I am going to give them a good dose of leather softner/conditioner. I really hope it works. I have never had any problems with Keen products. I only gave it a three out of five stars just for that reason."
4,a very delightful read,"This story is very well written and had me captivated from start to finish. Terrible things happen to good people and faiths are tested. However, out of a tragedy something good emmerges (Race and Rebbecca, who are are one of those couples you just love to cheer for). Race manages with patience and kindness to overcome some of Rebecca's fears. I especially like the scene where Race finally makes love to Rebbecca. It was handled with just the right mix of humor, passion and love."
2,Very disappointed,"I usually love Catherine Anderson's stories, but was very disappointed in this one. The violence & horrible happenings went on and on, and there wasn't much romance. It was more like a bad Louis L'Amour."
4,Cherish,"Fast moving, keeps your interest. Strong characters. Would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed romantic novels with strong characters.Excellent book"
5,One of the most enjoyable reads I have had,"Wonderful story. Great characters. Could not put it down. Thought the whole story line was well done, good descriptive narrative. Enjoyable"
2,Last 49% Of The Book Was Great!,"The first 51% not so much! I thought I would NEVER finish this book! the beginning was in almost all detail and no conversation or interaction with the heroine! I actually thought that this would be the 1st and only book by Catherine Anderson that I would not finish and love! Thank god for the last 49% of it! it's a like a light went on in her head that said "" Spice it up! "" . I was glad I bought it by the end but it was almost deleted off my Kindle! I give it 2 stars!"
4,"a great read, couldn't put it down","This was my first Catherine Anderson book. I loved it. I started late on sat.and finished sometime sunday morning. The relationship that built between Raceand Rebecca was slow and steady. I have recommended this book to many of myfriends who enjoy reading. One friend found it one audio cassette. I am areader, but she convinced me to listen. If you find the audio(check out yourlibrary) and give it a listen. I found the book and lend it out to my co readerwho are looking for a good read."
1,Superfluous riffs do not a symphony make,"I found this book dull and plodding, though it did have its occasional moments (too few and far between). FS&G, which has a fine reputation in publishing, should have assigned an editor to help Mr. Yunqué with both punctuation and content. A more capable writer could composed this ""author-proclaimed symphony"" with far less heavy-handed and obvious orchestration."
1,Horrid and indulgent,"I am a member of a book group and we were all mortified by this book. I found it exciting, in the beginning, to imagine getting to know many different generations of characters - over time. Instead, the story fell apart and the many graphic and unnecessary sex scenes (and usually I don't mind those), combined with the horrific, detailed violent rape and murder scene left me outraged. I felt that this author was merely using the readers to indulge his own fantasies. Every single chapter I read, I became more and more frustrated and disgusted. I love to read and I read alot - and I have NEVER loathed a book so much. I cannot imagine how anyone would have published it. It is flat, one dimensional, uninformed (relating to jazz etc.) and pornographic (with no purpose but to shock). I am disgusted anyone published it."
1,NOT AT ALL WHAT I EXPECTED,"The description of this video is the exact opposite of what it contains. It basically looks like a homemade video with the author's family opinion. I was very unhappy because I was teaching a bullying unit and wanted to show it to my students. It totally sucked, I feel ripped off and will never order something else from this author."
3,Creepy Zombie Scenes,"BONEMAN is a creepy story with excellently written zombie scenes. I recommend this book to zombie fans, but in parts there are a few too many pages between the zombie portions. The male journalist character is annoying and I didn't care about him. But the horror scenes are great, and the last several chapters turn very quickly. The ending is cool but we never learn what happens to all the zombie pushers. Instead the ending focuses on the human characters, who just aren't as interesting as the zombies."
2,Bad,Ghoulies IV is the worst movie I've seen in a long time. I feel it is a wasted effort. Prom Night stars Jamie Lee Curtis.
3,Lacking In Details,"The diagrams are well done; however, as with others, I was greatly disappointed that there was not more detail. The drawings are certainly better than the ones found in the old mission media kits, in that they provide more clarity, but they don't provide much more detail.I can't believe that no one has mentioned the obvious factual errors found in the text. The two most glaring ones are having the Apollo 7 mission in ""November"" of 1968 and having the first lunar landing (Apollo 11) on July ""24,"" 1969. Come on, give me a break!"
2,"Detailed drawings, very little additional information","This is a surprisingly small book with detailed but redundant drawings showing essentially the same Apollo components from different perspectives. It's very short on information on how these components function, why the materials were selected over other materials, and how they are used during missions. You end up with a book that has incomplete information on the components and incomplete information on their history.There are also a number of typographical errors that show it wasn't proofread very well."
5,A Must Have!,If you're a space nut you MUST own this book. The level of detail is amazing. You'll spend hours pouring through it. Check out its companion volume on the LM.
5,Exceptionally Useful Reference Material,"Although there may be some issues of minor inaccuracies - there really cannot ever be a single perfectly accurate representation of the Apollo spacecraft because each individual spacecraft was slightly different from the others. This book puts together a single reference that 3-dimensionally outlines the physical shape of these machines, that could only be otherwise obtained by researching thousands of source materials. This book is not only good, but is essential for anyone who has serious interest in the American Lunar program!"
2,Interesting but not fullfilling,"I looked forward to this book quite a bit as Appollo was THE project when I was a young engineer. The book, while extensive, lacks details and explanation of most of the material."
2,Easily bested by others.,Pretty generic. Poor detail that doesn't really explain anything is depth. Affordable grade graphics that doesn't show components in sharp enough detail to tell more than basics. I can easily get more detailed information from internet sources. I was hoping for more than brochure level diagrams.
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!,"I should have read the other reviews before letting my 12yr old order this item for his xbox!! The product you recieve is not the product advertised! If you order this you will recieve (like everyone else that has written a review) a card, good for XBox 360 Live Arcade (3000 points)...it will not work with a regular XBox and you must have XBox Live!"
3,I hate Target,Target...I bought this from target. WHAT DID I GET? A *^&%ING XBOX 360(WHICH I DONT HAVE) POINTS CARD!!!!! I am very furious at the company for making that kind of mistake. I will not shop online with Target(R) again.
2,It is not what it seems!,"Be warned, do not order this item from target.I ordered from target and received gamerpoints. I returned it for replacement and once again received gamerpoints.DO NOT ORDER FROM TARGET UNLESS YOU WANT 1600 GAMERPOINTS"
1,don't buy you dont' get what you think you ordered,this was awful because I never received the product I thought I ordered. They kept sending me a points card for XBox 360. I wante the starter kit for XBox Live but never got it. I finally had to go a different route to get what I needed for my son for Christmas.
5,Beautiful ambient from an unusual source,"What you will find with this release is long, deep, purely sonic explorations using the Tuba exclusively as the medium. Audio texture pioneer Robert Rich lends a hand as the producer."
4,Hauntingly beautiful ambient sound!,Who would have ever thought that the humble tuba had such potential! I had heard samples of this album on a radio show on which Tom Heasley was interviewed and was enthralled by both him and his music. This sound is thoroughly electronic and perhaps somewhat understated (which is fine by me - but it may appeal less to others.)
5,Can't believe it's bing discontinued!!!!,This is the best home hair color on the market and it's being pulled!!! Anyone know why? I have to contact Revlon and ask them to reconsider!
5,A Klezmer Sensation,After hearing Elie Rosenblatt perform live I couldn't wait to hear the CD. And I was not disappointed! It is truly excellent :) A must buy!
4,sweet!,Get this cd or I breaka you face! It's the best CD ever recorded ever in the entire history of human history in its entirety! All of it!
5,Comedy a plenty,"You'll laugh yourself silly with this book. Too bad it isn's available any more for purchase. I wanted to give a copy of it to a priest I know. He read the last book ""The Unoriginal Sinner and the Icecream God"" and used it in one of his homilies. I wanted him to have the full effect of the whole set. Guess I'll have to lend him my dogeared copy from MANY years past. I'd higly recomend this book as a comical look at many Catholic school childrens upbringing. Much of it is just plain silly, at other times, he hits it right on the nose. If you find it....BUY IT!!!!!"
5,Great Book about the old neighborhood,"This is a great book about my old neighborhood in the southwest side of Chicago in Mr. Greenwood. I knew many of the people that John Powers talked about, and can assure you that he brings them to life.Powers talks about the two religions, the Catholics and the Publics. I was a Public. We were a distinct minority, and had to spend many days in school while I Catholic friends were off, yelling ""sucker"" through the school window. We did own the sidewalks, however.I strongly recommend this fine book."
3,Book condition,"Loved the book 30 years ago, and found it at Amazon, so purchased it. Book fell apart from binder after just reading a few pages, so that tells me it was not properly stored. But I still enjoyed the read! Just had to hold the pages together with a rubber band. Will still order used books. Sight unseen. Not enough time in life to be too picky!"
5,A Gentle Story of a Lost Soul,"Being a big fan of the wandering spirits of Richard Russo's stories, I had high hopes for this story of Tom, a detached loser trying to find his way. I'm glad to say my expectations were met and in some cases surpassed by this briskly paced first novel by Mr. Spencer.The storytelling is vivid and efficient. The characters are almost painfully real and engaging. Most importantly, the plot is inventive and surprising.This is the best first novel I've read since Michael Chabon's Mysteries of Pittsburg and I wouldn't be surprised to see the same great things, including a Pulitzer, in the future for this new author."
1,Thoroughly worthless...,"This book is completely worthless. I bought it for a class only because I had to. It doesn't have anything in it that's not already common sense. I didn't learn anything except for a few new-fangled terms for stuff that I, or for that matter anyone who's ever held a job, already know. If you are looking to improve your management skills, don't waste your time with this book."
3,Cute as a button and about as small........,"This little pink iPhone case is really cute and feminine, but when I carry more than one credit card or one CC and my license, it won't close properly. I still use it, but wasn't able to make it work to carry as much stuff as I had hoped. There's a place for the phone and 3 slots for cards and that's it! The price is right, so I'd recommend it, but know that it's going to be small and limited in usefulness."
1,Do not buy this book.,"The text of the book does an adequate job of describing the basic algorithms. However, the source code examples are sprinkled with C intricacies and complexities that cloud the very subject matter that the book has set out to teach. The book has much to offer but I could not tollerate the horrid (yet thorough) source code examples, and did not get past the first few chapters."
4,Great! But there is a bug on source code. Watch out !,"Great book! Many practical algorithms are there. :) But also there is a practical bug on source code. For example, Ch 4,boyermor.c, listing 4-3 : Line 73:memset( CharJump, 0, Alphabetsize * sizeof(unsigned) );It should be as follows:memset( CharJump, PatLen, Alphabetsize * sizeof (unsigned) );This is a minor bug. But it can slow down boyer-moore searching speed. It's hard to be detected by empirical debugging. There is no bug in algorithm explanation. So,do not 100% rely on source code example. Read explanation, then apply example source code to your own source."
3,"Great idea, riddled with bugs","The idea of presenting a variety of popular algorithms from a non-mathematical perspective, and of including fully coded (in C++) implementations is a great one. Unfortunately, the implementations presented in this book suffer from lack of testing and the book often becomes an exercise in debugging."
2,Too Thin,"Too thin and wore out very quickly. I used them forwork around the house, trash pickup, painting, etc.I sometimes buy disposable gloves at the grocery store and they aresuperior to these."
4,developed an immunity,"I got a rash the first five times I used them, turned into just a little dry skin on the back of my hands, but this made potty training a puppy much more bearable!!! Next time I'll get something more hypoallergenic!"
4,A Study of a Modern Day Apache Community,"Basso offers us a survey of Apache history before detailing the current life of a modern Apache community in Arizona. He covers well social life based on kinship, and then explores econonmic and political life. Throughout, he uses his knowledge of the Apache language to give us better insight into Apache thought especially useful for understanding their religion.The book was widely used in anthropology courses as part of the Holt, Rinehart case studies series, but it serves the general reader well. ernestschuskycom/aboiut-the-author"
5,This book changed my life.,"I had been to many doctors in the last five years and none could tell me why I was having these symptoms so perfectly described in Dr. Smedley's book. I had had an MRI, colonoscopy, EEG, complete blood work, Upper GI, and the list goes on. All of them turned up negative for any disease. I was desperate because no doctor would believe me when I told them I was sick. None of these doctors, whether GPs or specialists, tied these symptoms together as indicative of gall bladder and thyroid disease. My GP wanted me to see a psychiatrist, and that is where I would have ended up, had I not had a gall bladder attack, which I thought was a heart attack at first. Fortunately, I live near Dr. Smedley's office and a friend recommended him to me. He diagnosed me immediately and gave me this diet to follow. Within three days, I was feeling much, much better. Dr. Smedley is a life saver."
5,There is a lot more to this book than what meets the eye.,"This book covers what to grow, where to grow and how to grow. There are color pictures in the middle to entice and encourage you. You get good tips on how to handle pests and pets (they are different). Different types of soil and drainage are covered. You get garden layout plans and containers for those of us that want to move the plants around a lot.This book does too good of a job. I was counting of a good number of the plants dying so I could try new ones. However these animals just keep coming back even after freezes. I also have a simple system for Morning glories; toss the seeds over the fence."
2,Slightly staticy,"I had this phone for 3 days before sending it back. It added some very slight static to the calls. To make sure it was not my line causing it, I plugged it directly into the wall at various points around the house, and I could hear the static even when it was not plugged into the phone jack. I think some people may not hear this or be this picky, but it was not that good for outgoing quality either. People on the other end told me I sounded a bit metallic when I switched between old and new phone and let them do an A-B comparison."
2,so-so,"I bought this lock because it was the cheapest I could get. It suits my purpose, but the design is shoddy and the combination lock has a fluid motion instead of setting into place when you align the numbers.The lock doesn't come with an option to set your own combination -- it comes with a preset combination and cannot be changed (so if you forget it, you're out of luck!)The chain and plastic cover look so-so. Definitely not high class.If you're looking for a CHEAP chain to lock your bike in a SAFE neighborhood, then this is your best bet. I would give it 1.5 stars, but they don't have that option here."
1,"Disappointing, not to mention boring","I've read Mary Balog's ""Simply"" series, so I was really looking forward to a new book! I've found her books witty, entertaining, and they have a lot of chemistry. Frankly, though, I could not care a bit about a single character in this book. They were all stilted, and even the language of the writing was ponderous. There wasn't any real attraction obvious between any of the characters of the book, and every relationship seemed forced. The book was, frankly, both boring and depressing."
1,Not her best book,"I love Mary Balogh's books ... but not this one! I undestand its one of her first novels, and its not as good as her more recent work.The story is predictable, the dialogues are repetitive and boring...If you read for the first time a Mary Balogh book, do not get this one.. she has great novels.. get her more recent works and skip this one."
2,moralizing and frequently boring,have read a number of books by this author - some of them dating back to when she first started to get published. I have notied in the past her tendancy to moralize but this one has to be the prize winner. Her characters spend so much time in needless soul searching and introspection that you can skip three pages out of every four and still find the hero then the heroine and all the secondary characters still beating their chests lost in their own self pitying worlds. At a number of points I just wanted to shake them all.Don'twaste your money.
1,Disappointing...,"This re-release should have stayed in the closet. Save your money and your time, and pass this one by. I can't really even remember the content of the story, even though I read it a few days ago. Very unremarkable story and writing. Balogh's other more recent releases are well worth the effort (the Bedwyn series especially) - I guess like all of us, since the late 1980's, she's come a long way."
2,Not a Hard to put down book,"This to me took a long time to get thru. Alexandra Purnell is not a likeable character. I wasn't taken in by the books story line. In the whole book the two characters that most got my attention, Madeline and James Purnell was the story I would have liked to have read about. Not impressed with this book. This author has done better."
1,The most boring I have ever read,"This book is as the other negative reviews sayVERY REPETITIVE!!!!BORING CHARACTERS!!!TOO MUCH RELIGION!!!NOT REALISTIC, the women is 21 and still controlled by her father by being punished to say prayers and eat bread and water, give me a break.I have read a decent amount a romance novals over the last five years and this is the worst one ever. Sorry to say that."
3,Dissapointing,"The Gilded Web is not up to the standard of Mary Balogh's later books. I read through the whole thing, because I'm such a devoted fan, but I found the characters stiff and not quite realistic, and the pace uneven. On the whole, I would not recommend it. Hold out for a new book."
2,Not up to her current standards by a long shot,"I have eagerly read all of Ms Balogh's recent endeavors, and have enjoyed them quite a bit. This book, a reprint from several years ago, was the first of her books that I could not read in entirety - I skipped to the end and even then was not satisfied. The writing is stilted and unimaginative, and the characters one dimensional. The side characters are more interesting than the main characters, by far. (While I am quite curious about the siblings in this story, I am nervous to buy the next installment of this series for fear the writing will continue to be as dull as in this book!) The story drags on and on, leaving the reader rather unimpressed with the heroine, and rather feeling sorry for the hero when all is FINALLY resolved. While I will definitely buy her future books, I think the books that are being reprised now are a far cry in quality from what Ms Balogh now produces."
2,Gilded Web,"Mary Balough's writing style is great. The book kept me entertained, but if you like certain things in your love story a few elements are missing. The characters a a bit simpery. There is very little sex in this book. There is a whole lot of sexual tension, but until the last 20 pages, everything was very chaste. The hero is the nicest man in the world, and has no sense of badness what so ever. The heroine is freaked out by him for the first 400 pages, and there is nothing gradual about when they decide they are in love. The love rev limiter goes from like zero to 100 like that. This is the only book I've read from Mary Balough. I love her writing style so I think I will try her again. She's sold so many books I bet the slowness of this one was just a fluke. P.S. I hate Alex's parents!"
2,Re- Release from 1989,The Gilded Web by Mary Balogh was awful. The first few chapters and the last few chapters were OK. It was basically 449 pages of drivel. I can believe I wasted a great Sunday on this book. Her later books are better.
2,One that should have stayed buried,"Mary's introduction notes how much her writing has changed over the years. (You got THAT right!) This book is about ""doing the right thing"" (him) and ""freedom/self-respect"" (her). She has a ""rich internal life"" but all he sees is this ""strange"" woman (his word) who barely speaks, runs away when he tries to kiss her and has no appreciation for what her situation is (she's being shunned by society through no fault of her own.) No real connection between them until a completely contrived ending. And it is WAY too long - the secondary characters essentially have novellas buried in this novel which I think slowed this thing considerably. And the religion overlay was stilted and forced. The Old vs New Testiment conflict really doesn't belong in a romance!This book is only for die-hard Balogh fans who will forgive such a wonderful author for this mess."
1,Very disappointed Balogh fan,"Having read and enjoyed many of Mary Balogh's books, I was rather looking forward to this book and have been greatly disappointed. Her books for the most part, are witty and funny, characters seem real and chemistry sizzles. This book is one of her earlier books that has been republished and I wish that they had edited and redone this poorly written book. I do not recommend this book."
2,Please pass me another one!,"This book is boring! Next to nothing happens. No excitement, no emotion, extremely flat. I didn't really care about any character (maybe her brother James . .. but not enough to find his book). Really old-fashioned writing even though the book isn't really all that old."
3,No proper instruction for how to use this product,"I want to use this product here in USA for the product I have from abroad (220 v). This product does not say anywhere that if I want to use this product here in USA , the switch should be in Top or bottom position. When the switch is on bottom position, on top of switch i can read 110 v, but what does this mean?I contacted seller for this issue and was very quick to help me resolve this problem, could have been little specific though.This is very important as one mistake can blue up this product and other product as well.Product looks strong and working accordingly the first time I have used. Not sure how it will function over the time."
2,Blackest Page of Modern History: Events in Armenia,"Interesting reading for a 1916 journal, but marketing wise- not worth the money that I paid for this journal."
5,Real Women Are Ladies,"Bought this used as a gift to a lady friend who was having marital problems. When the book was new, I gave copies to my daughter and each of my sisters-in-law. Doctor Grant preceded Doctor Laura on LA radio and I always listened to her during lunch and coffee breaks. She shows you how to be a classic lady (with a spine of steel) that men admire and want to please. She famously said ""You can be right ... or you can be loved"" when asked for advice about cettain situations. Oh, she describes the black madonna (the steel in the spine,) but she clearly defines how to manage that personna. By the way, I'm a man who really loves and admires a select bunch of women ... and I usually simply walk away from the kind of woman you only wantBeing a Woman - Fulfilling Your Feminity And Finding Loveto see next Tuesday!"
1,This book offends my sensibilities,"Dr. Toni Grant is a beautiful, charming woman, but her book did nothing for me. I do miss her wonderful radio program and wish it were broadcast here."
1,DR. TONI GRANT CHANGED MY LIFE,"My housemate Bea and I were counting on Dr. Grant's book to help us find that fulfillment we've been looking for; unfortunately, the dismal truth is that life has no meaning. PS: Hey Maude from New York! Of the various gender theorists of our era (Dr. Toni, Patricia Ireland, or Ariana Huffington, or Senator Hatch), my favorite is Orrin Hatch. His work on the alterity of uterine politics and the ""Woman Question"" brings forth a more practical approach."
2,Not-such-a-great classic,"Josephson is regarded as one of the semi-classic EP textbooks, but on the evidence of this edition, this may not be justified. The text is verbose, turgid and hard to read, and the numerous electrograms are poorly reproduced, making them hard to read and interpret. In retrospect, I'm not sure that this book was worth purchasing. The publishers need to clean up the text and improve the quality of the electrograms to make this a worthwhile purchase."
2,"Once a must-read, now a passable reference book","The text is patriarchal. ""I do"", ""I believe"", ""I think"" prevails. He's the grandpa of electrophysiology, but I think he should retire from writing books. Better alternatives exist (Clinical Arrhythmology and Electrophysiology: A Companion to Braunwald's Heart Disease: Expert Consult: Online and Print (Expert Consult Title: Online + Print),Catheter Ablation of Cardiac Arrhythmias: A Practical Approach,Handbook of Cardiac ElectrophysiologyandCatheter Ablation of Cardiac Arrhythmias. If you like the comprehensive approach, go forCardiac Electrophysiology: From Cell to Bedside: Expert Consult - Online and Print, by far THE reference book in EP.Let the old man (and his obsolete book) retire in peace and stop haunt the EP fellows' nights."
4,Great for small jobs,"Lacks power or stamina for longer use, especially in cold weather.It's maximum depth is limited, a sharp blade helps a lot, but if you get it for the right price, you'll be happy with it, just don't expect it to replace your corded Skil Saw."
5,Great Cordless for Those Who have Voicemail Service,"Just bought it last weekend. I love this phone. I wanted to buy a 5.8 GHz cordless without the answering machine because it already comes with my phone service. This phone is geared perfectly for that purpose. It has a voicemail button to access voicemail. The caller ID works great. The range is good, my front yard is 100 yards and the reception is clear at least to 100 yards. If you buy an expandable phone, the two phones can also act like a baby monitor. The phone also remembers the name and number of the people that call you, much like the Call Register feature on mobile phones."
4,Skeptical going in,"After reading all the reviews I could find, and admit to being a little skeptical of the voice quality to the caller, I purchased this phone and 2 satelite phones. First thing i did was make a number of calls and asked about the clarity and how my voice sounded. I also had my wife call me on the phone to check her voice quality and I was pleasantly surprised that in all cases, the clarity was fine and i did not experience any of the voice quality issues that others had reported. And this was without th ""voice enhancer"" being turned on.We also have a Sony phone that is 2.4 ghz . Not only does it interfere with the wireless router but the phonebook is hard to use. Not so with the Panasonic, it's phone book is great and no interference!Have no feel for battery life so far but I like what I see"
1,stay close,I ordered this phone because part of its title was giga range.I assumed that meant it had a decent range of usability from the base set. I cannott walk in the yard and get a clear signal. forget about going to the garden. over fifteen years ago I bought two escort brand cordless phones.Their range was at least ten times the panasonic.Sadly all escort makes now days is radar detectors.I kept one of them going as long as I could. Now I need a phone with some range.This phone goes back.
5,I couldn't put it down.,"I love history, but most history books are not what you would call ""page turners."" This one is, despite the fact that it begins the story of a 1927 event in the mid-19th century, with extensive biographies of two men long dead by the time the flood occurred. The writing is terrific. Open any page and Barry hits you with another gem. This is a great and important story, beautifully told. Get it. Read it. You won't be sorry."
4,A great history lesson!!,"This book covers the history of the Mississippi river, from the late eighteenth century up through the ""great depression"". Along the way, it covers parts of the history of engineering in the United States, a bit of Civil War history, race relations, politics, and more politics. It provides a good background for some of the issues relating to flooding in New Orleans, and may inspire the reader to go dig into other areas that are just briefly mentioned in this book. It has a lengthy appendix, with references, for those who are interested in the sources used."
3,A diverse presention of an extremely important subject,"Mr. Barry has done a very credible job in trying to present a history of the the great Mississippi flood of 1927. After reading the book, one cannot help but to wonder what might have happened to the crescent city if the levee had not been blown up. Would Huey Long have ever bcome a power to be recognized? Would Herbert Hoover had been elected President? Would the plight of the Afro-American been reduced or increased?The major problem with the book is the diversity used in trying to bring this disaster into perspective. Perhaps some of the references noted in the back of the book would lead some to wonder if these were innuendo or just idle gossip?The Mississippi is a river that is not only a stream creates life in the surrounding lands as it flow by, but also creates thoughts and feelings in any writer who has either seen or experienced it's might."
4,bogged down in the mud,"No doubt a great book. Its ponderous journalistic style was too much for me, however. Packed with dates, names, events, it is a dense chronicle of a tense time in the Mississippi Delta. About half way through, I just couldn't embrace any more facts and closed the book for good. Perhaps this was because I have trained my reading endurance on Sandra Brown and her ilk. William Alexander Percy's shorter account of the flood in Lanterns On The Levee was more my speed. Note to self: persevere in reading books carefully and lovingly written; reaching the finish line should be worth it."
5,Marvelous engrossing social history,"I am finding this book a fascinating, read. Only part way through book, but I find it riveting. Insights into the personalities of two engineering giant whose conflict shaped the approach to managing the river -- the wrong guy won. I am discovering things about the political and social history of the first half of the 20th century in America that are profoundly disturbing, but add new understanding of where we are today. Uncomfortable similarities between 1010 - 1930 US and today. Can't wait for the flood. I'm almost there. Oh by the way, it is brilliantly written!"
5,The Great Flood,I had never heard of the Mississippi flood before picking up this book and I am surprised that I had never hard of it after reading about it. This is arguably the greatest natural disaster to hit the United States until Hurricane Katrina. To see the response of the government then and now there are shocking similarities The army corp of engineers makes a similar performance and it is through private enterprise and local political networks that areas are saved. One of the sadder points in the book is the treatment of African Americans and southern racism in this time period is clearly displayed in most areas. The flood which wiped out parts of Mississippi and spread down to New Orleans was catastrophic. Seeing the idea of detonating levees and sacrificing areas of save others were tough choices that have implications in the post Katrina world. This is a highly recommend book that will make one think about natural disaster response from a truly catastrophic event.
5,The ultimate river engineering blockbuster,"This is a truly magnificent story/study of rivers, river engineering, river science (incl. lively descriptions of sediment movement and bed forms!), politics, power, disaster.... The river engineering story if ever one was written. Seems to fulfill the high Science and Technology Studies requirements, too!"
3,Informative but repetitive,Each new catastrophic situation eventually seemed to become overwhelmed with detail.I would have considered a trifle more editing than occurred
5,Rising Tide: The Great Mississippi Flood of 1927,"This is just a great book on history to have. It is long and not as easy to read, bit it is interesting."
5,Rising Tide,Excellent book about the Mississippi River floods of 1927. Recent flooding made me want to read more about the river and this book is perfect for that.
5,Great history of the flood of 1927,I grew up in an area that is bordered by the Mississippi River. It is an area that is protected by levees and further has a flood way to allow the corp of engineers to release water into if what used to be Cairo Ill was in danger of being flooded. This book does a great job of explaining the unusual events that created the flood and the damage it did but it also presents the little known history of the Mississippi Delta and the politics of that region. I recommend it to anyone who is interested in hydrology and politics. Great book!
3,The Book is worth it just for the first half,"The beginning portion about Humphreys, Eads, Ellet is a page turner. Anyone ever frustrated by bureacracy will cheer for Eads as he attempts to save the bridge and his jetties. After this, however, the story starts to sag and was difficult to get through."
3,used book sold as new,"This is a good book. Very well written. I'm half way through. However, I paid $63 for a ""new"" hardcover that way obviously used. Inside the cover was a personalized note to someone else, signed by the author. I've been duped, and I'm not happy."
5,Beautiful,I was so surprised when I received the package today. My perfume came in a beautiful gold box (like 8x8 inches) and included a body lotion. I never expected that and was very pleased. Thank you!!!! Excellent Job!!
3,"good, fast start","Those 36 pages, is a well written introduction to jobs interview, good tips, ideas, however It is short, not detailed. you can finish it in less than an hour."
2,The Unreal Pricing Guidlines,"I found that the prices given in this book were way off for my demographic and line of work. With the knowledge of bidding my own freelance jobs and hiring designers for the firm that I work for that the pay scales in this book are way out of wack. I'm not saying that they are all over priced like other readers might assume. I found that many estimates to be quite low.You run the risk of losing a job because your bidding estimate is to high in some instances and in other given estimates you are going to lose a lot of money. The given freelance hourly rate for an Art Director is $55.00. That is way under what the market pays in the area and industry that I work in.You will also find pricing like this: National advertising campaign (Print Media) between $11,000-$25,000. There are no specific variables given to this enormous disparity in pricing.There is a heap of useful information in this book, but pricing isn't one of them. In fact it's bloody useless."
3,"Useful, but time for a new edition","I find the book very useful for many purposes, and it was right on the mark when it came out four years ago. However, considering how quickly technology and the internet change, I think it's time for a new edition; a lot of the ""digital design"" information is woefully out of date. For instance, under ""Questions to ask when designing a web site,"" the book asks, ""Does the client understand the difference between the Web and an online e-mail service such as American (cq) Online?""In addition, pricing is based on ""screens"" or ""pages"" for web sites. The overall rates in the book seem to be realistic, but it would be helpful to know exactly how projects are priced. In the rapidly evolving world of database-driven and fully animated sites, ""pages"" don't mean much anymore. This is a fine reference, but don't expect it to keep you on the cutting-edge of technology. Go into a client's office and talk about ""American Online"" and I can almost guarantee you won't get the job!"
5,Judge this book by it's cover!,"Brilliant cover illustration and indispensable content. Thanks Graphic Artists Guild for supporting and defending the visual arts profession. Couldn't do it without you and this ""bible""."
3,"a good reference, but not exactly a 'bible'","In general the book is a good reference of customs and forms. However I'm a web designer and found out the prices in that section were from '98 or so, the height of dot.com indulgences, and light years from where the profession is now. In these dot-bomb recessionary times, the prices were much higher than most designers could get and largely useless for me. So if you're looking for another general source of advice for your professional collection it's fine, but it's not (as probably no publication could be) the last word on pricing."
2,I WISH I could quote the prices suggested by this book...,"...I would be making a better living. There are some good ideas about negotiating contracts, about rights that artists have, and legal mumbo jumbo you can throw at people. In the real world, though, I've found that it is near impossible to retain these rights when signing standard pre-fab contracts with clients. The pricing guidelines seem high compared to what I'm seeing currently. This book is ok as a rough guide."
1,Shouldn't be recommended by Amazon,"I bought this CD because it was recommended by Amazon.If I didn't have to pay the shipping cost, I would have loved to return the product.The sound quality is very poor and the length is too short.It was a waste of money."
1,Terrible....,"It worked the first time I used and then not at all. There was no phone number on the instructions (which were difficult to read and did not even include instructions on all the parts that were in the box), that I called them from the telephone number on their box and before I even described the problem, I was directed to print a form off the internet and to send the whole unit back!I think that if someone offers a product, the least they should do is to sort out problems quickly and without a fuss!"
4,Toy story power play Review,"Since I have XP, I had to play this on Virtual PC. But this game is far superior to it's console siblings. The music is the freaking best part, its way more live then the others (granted, those where 16-bit renditions). If you like toy story,have windows 95 or virtual pc, then this is a MUST buy."
2,Make sure you have Windows 95,"We weren't able to play this game on our main computer because we didn't have windows 95, since it is an older game. And the info that we read about it didn't specify this, it only said ""for windows""."
1,Obsolete game [maybe],"I wish I knew if this game was fun or not. Unfortunately it is not compatible with anything newer than Windows 2000. I was unable to get my computer to recognize the CD. Admittedly, this could be user-error. I have not been able to find a newer version of this game as of yet, but when/if I do, I will update this review."
5,Very informative,The author has further opened my eyes to what we were exposed to while serving in Vietnam. Confirmed my suspicions that herbicide exposure was the cause of my carcinoid tumor in my lung.
1,T WOTJ,The discription did not say that this was completely made up of paragraph revisions. Very dissapointed
5,DJ Krush - not the usual off malign hip-trip hop experience,"This album is a potpourri of tasty flavas that keeps coming track after track. This deep seeded conceptualized effort by Krush establishes him as one of the great DJ/Producers on the scene, grabbing darker urban textures to convey his ambient, yet groove-oriented approach to making music that in the end result, sounds ultimately like no one else. From the heavenly beats and quirky melodies of ""85 Loop"" to the smooth, dreamy lushness of ""Crimson"", Krush stylizes no one in favor of his own unique voice, escaping to a realm of sound development and songwriting that is strong, complex, and intelligent. Ablaze with a true sense of purpose and direction, Kakusei assumes it's role, and leaves trip hop enthusiasts coming back for a hearty dose of seconds. Highly recommended."
4,Very smart,"This is a great listen. DJ Krush is a standout among DJs-- he combines smart and surprising beats over a cool, relaxed background. The track with Esthero is one that you can crank the bass, turn down the lights, and enjoy over an over again. It'll be a standard."
3,Simple Krush,"This is just a cd that krush did for himself instead of a big-budget deal. this album is very static, the beats are simply a steady background, krush wants the listener to really pay attention to the simple act of making simple music. It works for a few tracks, except you loose interest when there is really no ""spice"" in the pieces. He does have some amazing samples, he knows how to work them right. In an interview he said ""I want to get back to the essence of music"", he succeds, it is a very minimalist cd."
4,Great downtempo tip0hop,"For some--not what you're looking for--so don't bother reviewing.For others, this is a great down tempo/hip hop blend of deep beats and rhythms.Admittedly, not what I was looking for--but found it intriguing none-the-less--beautiful 1-offs with deep soulful melodies and intriguing bass lines.Give it a shot if you dig this sort of gig.PS check out x-men if you dig turntablism, and Sasha if you dig melodic down tempo. You may even dig on London Electricity or Thom Yorke.hope this helps__Statik"
5,I'll never get tired of this CD,"This cd, unlike oh so many of my trip-hop collection, will not get boring or old. I love it! This is THE disk to have--well worth the money!"
5,"For turntablelist, with a nod to hip-hop.....","This cd represents what I like best about DJ Krushes work. When he wants to he can be as creative as any dj, but he needs the backing of equally talented people who can hold up their end. On this cd he has plenty of company with home grown and American talent as well Esthero from Canada. I will say this is a cd for turntable oriented listeners, and those who can listen to intramentals without your attention wandering."
4,DJ Krush - Kakusei,"DJ Krush's unique brand of mellow instrumental hip-hop has always been a point of pleasure, and _Kakusei_ is no different. From the deep tones of the ""Intro"" to the simple piano chords in ""Deltaforest,"" he manages to bring things to a nice even keel. Although I wouldn't term his work abstract, I would say it's definitely spare. Krush doesn't waste time with extraneous sounds or overly distracting noises -- he's got the beat, the bass, and the melody. ""The Dawn"" brings in some strings and saxophone, but the mood remains defiantly chill. Unfortunately, he reprises that mood a little too much in ""Rust,"" but the light touch of ""1200"" quickly smooths over the rough spot. The ghost of Ennio Morricone haunts the instrumental version of ""Final Home,"" but when Esthero adds her vocals to the mix, she adds an earthiness that gives the track some real pop."
4,Dark and Compelling,"Very austere, very beautiful in it's unique way. To my mind, an excellent soundtrack to a rainy 3AM in the big city. If you've been overloaded with the too-slick and the overproduced, get this CD: a breath of super-cool fresh air."
4,Different,"This is a small movie, with small, regular people as its main characters. That's not a slight ... it's a breath of fresh air. So much Hollywood stuff is made of tales of horror, action heroes, superheroes etc that it's nice to see big stars like Ms. Aniston doing regular things as a regular person in a nice little small movie.And Mr Zahn is a gift to all, so the more we see him, the better.And to all the Hollywood execs out there ... please, please, PLEASE put these two together again soon, and often, 'cause they work like magic."
1,I have a third-degree crud burn on my frontal lobe,"After screening the first ten minutes of this utterly depressing and psychologically unrealistic ""comedy"", I asked myself if I'd rather continue watching or eat my own foeces... wherupon I repaired to the W.C. with a bib around my neck, brandishing a knife and fork and grinning that, well, that grin. The 1970s tv series Supertrain was much better than this movie."
1,One star because I can't rank it any lower,"This movie was terrible. The romance was forced, the plot line boring, Aniston is dull, Zahn is not funny and Harrelson must have been out of lunch money (why else would he do this horrible film?)."
2,Airless and not the slightest bit funny,"Is this a romantic comedy? If so, they forgot the romance and the comedy. Aniston is dried up here, but I guess that was her character. Steve Zhan is the most likeable character, but that's not saying much. Woody Harrelson si simply a cartoon as a retired punk musician turned yogurt mogul. Someone must have thought this vehicle would fly, but it doesn't. It takes a weird turn halfway in, when Zhan starts jumping out of airplanes and turning into a Bhuddist monk. Check this one off on your list of Jennifer Aniston date movie flops."
1,This movie could have killed Jennifer Aniston's career,"There is nothing positive I can write about this movie. I'm a big fan of Jennifer Aniston and bought the DVD solely to see her performance. I actually found myself feeling sorry for her that she risked her career to appear in this dud of a movie. The movie is slow, the story-line is totally unbelievable, and there is absolutely no chemistry between the ""stars."""
1,Bad Management,Steve Zahn is Mike a night clerk at his parent's motel in Kingman Arizona. Jennifer Anniston is a corporate saleswoman who enters his life one night as a guest and gets him excited that he follows her all over the country to make her fall in love with him. Woody Harrelson plays Django her lover and the obstacle in their inevitable love. Steve Zahn is believable as the dim witted but lovable clerk but his character is hackneyed. Jennifer Anniston and Woody Harrelson are wasted in this enterprise because their characters are so predictable and badly written.A complete waste of film stock and talent and not to mention my wasted money and time watching and writing this review. The only solace I can find after watching this movie is in the fact at least a few dozen people were employed while making this movie but then a lot of productivity time was lost while watching this movie as well. Miss it. One star 02/05/10
2,"FAIR, BUT WITH GOOD REASON!!!","The only good reason I purchased this dvd was for Jennifer Aniston. First the movie has No direct plot, no real chemistry connection between the two main characters. The movie has good acting and a sense of ""loner"" to the two main characters, but warning actor Steve Zahn's character is not funny like he was in his many movies before. Jennifer Aniston's role is guildless and very cold, with this being a ROM-COM it is truly not. I gave two stars only with good reason rent only buy IF ONLY ON SALE."
5,A romantic comedy gem...,"""Management"" is a very quirky, fun and irresistible movie!A great cast - Steve ZahnNational Security,Joy Rideand Jennifer AnistonThe Break-Up (Full Screen Edition),Marley and Me (Single-Disc Edition)team up for a fun time, the movie also stars Woody HarrelsonKingpinas Aniston's zany ex -boyfriend (Jango).If your looking for a good movie to relax and have a few laughs, this is it. Zahn and Aniston really do have that certain chemistry in this movie and it shows.If you debating on whether or not you want to watch this one, ignore the 3 or 4 bad reviews and listen to the many, many good ones here, its definitely worth your time.Enjoy~"
5,Don't miss this one...it's a keeper!,"This one is a real charmer, full of heart and humor. You'll be rooting for these two to get together, and the supporting cast is amazing. This is one of those ""small"" films that's worth its weight in gold - don't bother renting it, just buy it, because it's a keeper! Totally original, refreshingly unguarded, and just a sweet, funny story. Did I mention I'm very fond of this one? Do something nice for yourself, and discover Management!"
4,Lovely and heartfelt,"This was a lovely, heart-tugging little movie -- funny, and sweet, yes, but also full of the kind of depth you don't usually find in today's romantic comedies. Totally worth watching more than once."
2,For women...,the movie might be a 3 star but for men it is a 2 star. Just a movie to watch if you are on a plane with nothing else to do.
1,STAY AWAY FROM MANAGEMENT,"THIS HAS TO BE ONE OF THE MOST PREPOSTEROUS MOVIES EVER..TOTALLY UNBELIEVABLE ALMOST ALL THE WAY THRU. WE TURNED IT OFF WHEN WOODY FIRST APPEARED. SO MANY HOLES IN THIS MOVIE IT'S LIKE SWISS CHEESE! YOU CAN'T BELIEVE A MINUTE OF IT! FORTUNATELY GOT IT FROM REDBOX, SO I ONLY WASTED $1.08. PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FLAVOR AND STAY AS FAR AWAY FROM THIS YAWNER AS POSSIBLE!"
2,"Solid acting, slow story line.","I usually adore Jennifer Aniston movies, so I thought I would like this one. I did NOT. The movie felt so depressing. I've seen plenty of movies with depressing subjects and still liked the movie. She played a dramatic and somewhat depressing role in 'The Good Girl', which I loved. However, there was something about the way Management was shot that just made me want to look at the wall, my cat cleaning himself across the room, my son's Power Ranger toy strategically placed right at the top of the basements stairs. I felt so A.D.D. trying to force myself to watch this movie. 2 stars because the acting was not bad, but the story line and flow were aweful."
4,Road less traveled,This was a great indy film that was off beat and precious at the same time. Casting couldn't have been better and who doesn't like to wish for the underdog? Simple and interesting that makes you smile in the end.
5,lovely independent movie,"I can understand why some people didn't like this: it is unusual, not your standard Rom Com. But here is what I loved about it:- extremely well acted: the main characters have a sweetness and muddledness that evolves during the course of the movie, and does so in a way that is both moving and convincing. And, while at the beginning it was hard to believe that the two characters could grow close, by the end (or really the middle), it was very believable. I loved both Zahn and Aniston. and the supporting actors were funny (woody herrelson) and good (everyone).- the story is romantic but not in a usual way. it's paced more slowly, which I liked a lot once I got used to it.- it has a sweetness that derives from the Steve character (played by steve zahn), and actually from the other characters too.if you like independent movies, with their unusual pacing, then definitely try this one."
2,Very very little movie,"This is a series B movie at best. The whole story is predictable, filled with cliches and the acting is childish. Rent if you really want to see that but definitely not worth owning."
1,"Boring Movie, but Silver LIning",I didn't like the movie but i thought it was great to see Michael J. Fox doing so well.
5,Great and durable!,"I bought these replacement products in the event my original ones in the pump bag were to break, warp, tear, or otherwise become unusable. I have yet to need these, but keep them in my Avent pump bag for peace of mind. By far my most favorite breast pump of all."
3,Good Product,"My girlfriend said this was a must have so I got one. It is fine, but I actually don't love it and only use it about half the time. My daughter uses it more frequently."
1,MISLEADING,This set DOES NOT come with the 40 page teacher's guide that is advertises. I'm very disappointed with this because that was the only reason I purchased this DVD set from Amazon.
4,Love's soft message remembered.,I sent a different book in this series and its matching DVD to my former wife and each of my estranged daughters-in-law for Mother's Day with the admonition to read/view the then pass them on. I have enjoyed this series (in DVD form) from the Hallmark Channel and felt their gentle Gospel-centered themes would help folks who may have let some on the important things slip by to pause and reflect. Good stories. Subtle messages.
2,I really regret buying this book,"This seires is really boring to me. There's hardly any climax. Nothing interesting at all.But some people do like it, I have to emphasize this point. It's just not of my taste."
5,Oke did it again.,This is one of my favorite books out of the series. I love the adventure and romance that this book brings with it. I laughed and I cried but mostly I cried. I love this story and think that everyone should read it.
4,Movie confused me..........still liked it,"I started reading the books after i watched all 3 movies. The book was very different then the book. I cant say i was disappointed. I enjoyed reading this version. This book was about Missie's journey to the west, and what she went through to get there. How hard it must of been. I still recomend this book. Just dont go into it thinking it is like the movies."
5,An absolute must,"This book offers a fantastic insight into the 1st performances and preparation of Sacre. Anyone interested in ""getting back to the source""must purchase this book"
2,not too great,"The cats roll in it--but must not be strong, the cats are not jumping or running around like they do with other cat nip"
5,Wow what a big container!,Very generous amount of high quality Catnip! Container reseals air tight and can be reused. Feline bliss all round! >^..^<
3,lots of catnip. hard to tell what the cats think of it,their small can is a lot of cat nip. my cats like many are coy and don't show excitement right away. but I catch them sneaking over for a little cat nip toy play.
5,Kitty Love,The catnip looks fresh and gives the desired effect. I give my cat a little once a week so this tub will keep me supplied for a while.
2,defective,"It is missing the credits to each episode. Also the last episode ""Once Upon a Crime"" on the dvd doesn't work."
2,Had 4 bad DVDs from 2 different states,My mother had bought this DVD for my son from a Walmart in IN when watching it I noticed the last ep didn't work toke it back to my Walmart here in Tampa FL thinking it may of been a bad disc got that one home still didn't work tried a different DVD from 3 other walmarts still the same thing so I just returned it and got my money back great idea for Halloween just wish it would of worked right
3,Would probably be OK if they could get one to the customer undamaged,This is definitely one of those situations where you are better off to buy the part locally from a store so that you are able make sure you are getting an undamaged item. This one just showed up at my house with some rows of smashed fins and vertical gouges.
2,Disappointed,"The eggs stick. I spray heavily with Pam, the eggs stick - and it's a bugger to clean. There's just something cheap and odd about the non-stick coating. If it was quality non-stick, it would be a perfect little thing.Now here I am looking to buy another poacher and hopefully this time the ""you get what you pay for"" rings true (I plan on spending a lot more, but we really love our poached eggs)!"
1,Sticks,"Read reviews about this product, purchased anyway. Sorry I didn't listen to others, eggs stick."
3,Useable ......... if you modify it just a bit.,"I use Analon Titanium pots and pans. This unit as it was shipped wouldn't fit in any size pan except the 12"" skillet or the large 10 quart cooker. That would have been a pain. I found that if I put enough downward pressure on each of the four ""legs"" they bent inward enough to fit snuggly into my 10"" pan. The next problem was the center spindle. Although it was one of the things I liked about the design, Analon uses a very shallow lid. Remove one screw and the spindle is gone and everything works now. I had a smaller more lightweight version with 3 cups but this unit is much better. The metal is much heavier grade and the cups themselves are just a bit larger. No more overflow problems like in the 3 cup version I used before. Without the spindle it's easier to store as well."
