4,Bought as replacement for exact same product,"I bought this to replace a bad Hunter Pro-C controller. The old one had an issue internally that would blow transformers.The new one has worked with no issues, but they had changed the design of the additional zone controller that slides in, so I was unable to use that from the previous model that was already in place.Once installed, re-programming and re-setting everything up was quite simple, just time consuming.If I wasn't replacing one that had gone bad, I would probably rate this 5 stars. But as it stands, the new controller has not been in service long enough to say whether or not it will happen again."
1,awful really awful,when i heard there was a crouching tiger hidden dragon video game for the xbox i was so happy intill i bought it every thing about this game is horrible such as the graphics they were the whorst graphics i have seen i have seen better graphics in a old super nes game the enemy Ai was horrible they would surround you and attack at once and if you mannage to attack the enemys in escape they would just go back in their oringal spot where they once were in another bad thing is the camera angles 7 out of ten you cant see where your going in that sucks do not buy this game becaues if you do you will be sorry trust me when i say your be sorry.
4,This is addictive everyone must play it at least once.,Pretty cool as best described by my 5-year old.He picked up the weapons options quite readily and enjoys playing alot. His father enjoys it too.
4,Is there a number for HOLY CRAP!,"From beginning to end this game is the ultimate shooter (not shooting) experience. The graphics just scream to be worshiped. From the explosions to the techno soundtrack sound is supurb. However no game survives on ""sense-candy"" alone. So how does it stand in the gameplay depart? Head and tails above the other ""standard"" Playstation games. It is the perfect experience for an old-school shooter fan like myself. Just blast anything that moves; a heavenly experience. I highly recomend it for every Playstation owner out there!"
1,Buy this only if you already know Java EE,"This book makes sense only if you already know Java EE, but in that case you don't need it. One of the worst tutorial I've ever seen. Wasted a lot of time trying to understand what it says, but that's so hard because it keeps referring to concepts that are be not covered until later chapters (forward referencing). The examples are working, but no clear explanation on what each of them does, how to reassemble them, etc. No step by step guide. Even concepts aren't explained well enough."
3,New version available,"There is a new version available of this book. It was updated in October of 2008 and, best of all, it's a free download. Just google ""The Java EE 5 Tutorial"" and you'll find it on Sun's website. It's also available as a PDF."
1,horrible,"It's a book written by the technical writers. People who have no idea, what they are talking about, what things are important and what are not. It goes on and on and on about the useless details and misses the important things."
2,Bought the book for school - hard to understand,I got an A in my college course but no real help from this book.Too long and hard to understand.
5,Commentary from Malaysia Trading Group,"Our comments as follows.- We computerised our trading floor with pattern code.- Need Tradestation software- Separate CD product has good intraday indicators for 3-line break and ACD code- Rectangle pattern work very well daily and real-time.- Lots of free code, book cheap for this reason"
1,Hand picked examples do not work in reality,Summary from my full length review - A showcase of trading systems written for TradeStation. Examples are hand picked. The systems do not work well when applied in reality.
2,Alright,"Lets not get too excited. Not sure how much reading and technical analysis other readers have done, while I think some of the book is useful other parts of it seem to be a waste and pretty basic. It wasnt what I was looking for and the price seems way too high. Seems for whatever reason its out of print in the stores so the author and his company are selling it for a huge mark up. Didnt get the software and the code doesnt work the way it is written in the book, either out of date or needs to be updated TS code.Unless you really want it, I would pass on this one at the price offered."
1,Shop around,"I have not yet read the book but quickly discovered a couple of things of which you might want to be aware. The software is ""included"" in that the last 60 or 70 pages (sorry...I have already packaged it for return) are source code. The software is not provided in an electronic format. You are referred to the author's website to purchase the software ""pretyped"". Figuring it would be worth it to avoid the typing and typos, I went to the website to discover that the software is $199 and the book is $99. Since Amazon listed the book new for $199 and used for around $180, I was slightly annoyed and will be attempting to return the book.Bottom Line - price shop this!"
5,A Classic Review,"This is the real deal, and I truly believe that this book has some revolutionary concepts. They developed a pattern recognition system that recognizes combinations of bar patterns, candlestick formations, and breadth indicators. They also automate some of the recent interesting work from Steve Woods and his float analysis stuff, not to mention a complete pair trading system. The book emphasizes the automation aspect more than trading system design, and I would have liked to see them step through the design of one of their systems from conception to implementation, but certainly I had a lot of ideas just from reading the book. I sense the authors have a lot more to give and look forward to future editions of the book. I would like to see them eventually include code for other trading platforms such as MetaStock or WealthLab."
5,"Requires much study, but it deserves it","If you're looking for some light reading on trading systems, this is not the title for you. But if what you want are detailed, well fleshed-out trading systems to study as examples or even to use, this is an outstanding library of ideas that are fully implemented as code. The focus on TradeStation as the platform is only mildly distracting if you're using a different programming approach, there is enough detail here to go your own way with another language. It will take quite some time to dig through everything because the prose isn't quite as clear as it could be in spots, but the time spent will easily pay off to the serious student of trading systems."
4,Volatility trading system is good,"I give credit to these guys for providing the complete system rules for entries and exits along with some position sizing algorithms. There are many, many books on patterns, and few of them ever give performance statistics. At least with this code you can import it into TradeStation and be up and running in a matter of minutes. That said, some of the systems are good and some are not so good. I suspect that the pairs trading system might have worked when there was intraday volatility but the market has changed since then. The linear regression system (V) is good and should be applied to momo stocks. It has been phenomenal in this market, don't think I'd use it in a bear market. There is another system in the book that is even better but I'm not gonna say here. It's my bread-and-butter, so there ;-)."
1,I have real reservations & concerns about this one...,"Despite the apparent sophistication of the many diverse trading strategies and systems introducted in this book, none of them seem to back-test well on historical data in TradeStation. By well; I mean any better than most simple moving average cross-over systems! So why bother paying $100 for the book and another $200 for the software CDROM?I also emailed the author for help getting these sytems to work at all on FOREX. Theoretically, this should be doable by changing profit target and other stop variables. He returned my emails twice promising support but then I never heard from him again.I'm left with the impression that these systems just don't work on either stocks or FOREX. Buyer beware."
3,Too small,"This format seems to be too small for the kind of postcards we have in the Middle East. Makes a fine photo album, though..."
4,Carte postale,"It was perfect for a project I had of organizing old postcards. Unlike many photo albums, it easily accommodates a variety of sizes"
4,Love It!,"I just finished filling an album and will be purchasing a second. I have been searching for years for an album to hold the post cards I've received and purchased as souvenirs for over three decades. I love the Art Deco design, the pages are made with heavy stock paper that will hold up to what I suspect will be lots of page turning as I review the album over and over. A wonderful, inexpensive, welcome gift for anyone who likes to preserve memories."
4,Cute Little Book,"This is a very nice little book for the casual postcard collector. It is not very large so watch out if you have over sized postcards. The postcards are held in the book by being inserted into pre-cut corner tabs so there is a danger of slight damage if you are not careful. That said the pre-cut corners also make it hard to fit in larger postcards. However this is not the product for someone who is looking to archive rare postcards or use for a serious collection. But it works great for my ""places I have traveled"" postcard collection!"
1,"Love this light, but poor battery management makes it worthless","Uses a lead-acid battery. Like all lead-acid batteries, if not kept regularly and fully charged, they lose their ability to be charged. Mine quit charging after only 2 months. Would have preferred it use lithium rechargeables. They have limited life (usually 1.5 years) but at least they work during that time frame."
3,Almost a PITA,I bought this table from a local toy store. My husband was lucky enough to get the task of assembling it. It took him about an hour and when it was all done... It didn't fit under the bed unless the bed was adjusted and the drawer to the table was too small and always fell off one side of the drawer track while sliding it in and out. It also didn't hold a lot of larger pieces. I contacted the toy company about the drawer not fitting correctly and they sent me another drawer with the exact measurements so it also didn't fit. I returned it for a full refund. My boys like setting the track up in the living room where they have a lot more room anyway. I'd like to add...Had I purchased this table from Amazon instead of my local toy store I'm not sure I would have been able to return it for the defect of the drawer with out hassle and shipping fees.
2,Poor Quality,"Difficult to put together, parts did not line up, had to use WD-40 to get a part screwed on, drawer does not open and close easily, metal drawer track is bent, when UPS delivered package it looked like it had been through heck, part of the table top was completely exposed which caused slight damage to the corners, perhaps another delivery method would be better. All in all I expected a lot better for the money I paid, I have seen fully assembled Thomas' train tables before, and they seemed pretty sturdy, this table does not seem of the same quality."
1,HO HUM,"Americans only seem to remember Connie for her many hits which was not her best material. It made her famous and rich and sent her career sailing farther than any other female singer. But the great Connie Francis can be found in her later work Try ""Standards"", the 3 South Africian collections (hard to get). You'll hear the REAL Connie. I am glad people are still buying her records, even if it is the oft time released hit collections, but she deserves better and should be acknowledged as the fine song stylist that she still is...as she currently tours and the audiences love her. Bravo Connie. You are one of the very few fine singers left that can still carry a tune. And boy can you carry it! WOW!"
3,Greatly abbreviated best-of collection,"Though one can't fault the tracks that are included here, it's disappointing to find this collection seems to have replaced the splendid ""The Very Best of Connie Francis, Vol. 1."" Given that the original 1963 ""Very Best of"" had 15 tracks, and the CD reissue had *21*, the 12 titles on this disc are a paltry offering.There are quite a few top-40 hits missing, including the truly stellar Sedaka/Greenfield penned ""Fallin',"" the torchy ""You're Gonna Miss Me,"" Paul Anka's ""Teddy,"" and the title tune from 1963's ""Follow the Boys.""This current release may be easier to buy (and have a better booklet), but a used copy of ""The Very Best Of, Vol. 1"" is the better spin."
4,The Best of Connie Francis,"I enjoyed listening to the CD very much. I enjoy 'oldies' music but I just wish that for a millennium collection there would have been more selections on this CD. Still, I'm very glad that I purchased it."
4,Who's Sorry Now,"Don't be sorry if you purchased this because it is a nice collection of all her big ones. Great voice and slightly underated as a performer. Had a string of hits but was put into the ""pop"" category instead of the ""rock and roll"" category."
4,CONNIE,"You have to remember and like Connie to buy this CD. This album has most of her hits, at times when I would hear her songs I kind of wish I was one of those boys."
2,"Connie 5 Stars, 20th Century Masters 2","Unfortunately there is no way to leave a review just for the production of the CD. Without need to review Connie, the sound quality on this series is sorely lacking. The highs are unbearably harsh, and yes, I have a very good sound system.I'm afraid that this may be indicative of the 20th Century Masters series. I guess they may be cheap for a reason. This is the second CD in the series for me (I also tried the Patti Page CD) and I think it may be my last."
3,Connie's music it self is good,The sound is not so good....kinda tinny. Must not have been any re-recording of this one. So therefore I am a little disappointed.
5,Connie Francis 20 Century,I really liked the quality of this cd I felt like I was right there and the song bring back more than one pleasent memory
1,Their flows are WEAK.,"I have gotten the flows down for the songs they did, better than them. Their breathe control is terrible. The beat reproduction is average, for one of these ""tribute"" albums. Their voices are _ALRIGHT_ But their flows ruin the album, they need to take some spittin' lessons."
1,DO NOT Buy,"No matter how big of a fan of 50 Cent/G-Unit you are, do not buy this album. I love G-unit, so I thought that this album had to be good, even though it was sung by other artist. Boy was I wrong. These punk bitches that are ""paying tribute"" to G-Unit easily have the most annoying voices that I have ever heard. I pray that they never get any real record deal. I can't believe a dropped $15 for this cd. It's funny how these guys can turn some of the hardest, most real lyrics and beats and turn them into this crap. No matter how big of a fan you are, DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM. 50, Young, Banks, or Yayo make no appearances either."
1,Is this a Joke?!?!?!?!,Oh my goodness....what is this? Why would anyone wanna do soemthing like this? I wouldnt worry about it because when 50 cent catches up to these guys they will get popped. Dont support this... this is garbage
1,Tribute?!?!,"These albums can hardly be called tributes. They suck. Instead this album should be titled ""We stole G-Units lyrics and made them sound like crap"""
1,WHY?!?!?!?!?!?,"How come the makers of these ""tribute"" cds havnt been sued for playjorism?They take songs and get some random guy off the street and have them rap the song.These people suck at rapping.Their voices are annoying and i dont think they will ever have a rapping career.I hope the producers of these tribute cds get sued and go bankrupt so they wont ever make one of these again.They kill good songs from great artists (50 cent,outkast,eminem,and there is probly more).So never buy one of these."
5,definitely flexible,"Compared to the other two spatulas by All Clad, this one is very flexible. I find this tool as excellent and extremely useful. Don't know what the dissenting reviewer was expecting but I find this accessory terrific."
3,Fun,"For the most part the game has learning advantages...taking turns, counting, putting puzzles together. We like the Dragon Tales glad this is better than the dvd I bought.This is cute but their is others I would buy first."
4,Solid bit - does the job,I needed a bit to drill a hole to fit a metric - sized item and this worked very nicely.I was disappointed to find out that I could have gotten the same item for the same price with only $1.00 shipping from Routerbitworld.**com instead of the $7.37 which Timberline tools charged...
3,Great photos - but no step-by-steps!,"The photography is great, showcasing the lovely braided styles. However, you do not get ""step-by-step"" instructions on how to do each of those styles. What you get is a ""general"" guide on how to braid and do the 'steam seal' technique for the braids.I was dissappointed since I would have loved to been shown in a diagram format how to do the styles themselves. This book (it's really more of a very expensive magazine) is great if you own a braiding salon and just want ""pictures of braid styles"" to display to your clients. But if you want to LEARN how to do the styles themselves --- you will not learn at all!Not to give the secret away, but if you are looking to learn how to make your braided ends look neat - just think about the ""STEAM"" in the so called ""steam sealing"" technique, and you will save yourself (money)!"
1,I would like to have my money back from this book.,"I thought this book .... There are a great variety of braided hairstyles (long, short, pixie, nubian, cornrows, etc.) and this book only covers a couple of long styles and they were basically the same. I was so disappinted because my hair is short and I was looking for a short sassy braid style. I was expecting a big book with a lot of different styles and designs. I could have bought a [$$$] braid magazine and got my money's worth, however, I spent [money] on this one.I am very upset, I thought about calling St. Croix to complain and I still may do just that. I can't express my disappointment enough!"
2,Totally Dissatisfied Customer,"I was really disappointed with cost of the book after reviewing the contents. The photos were nice, but I could have bought a braid magazine at the grocery store for one eight of the price. I feel that this book is over priced."
3,Cushion Needs Maintenance,"This product is a great idea and my little 9-pounder LOVES that he can sit up so high in the car and have a 360 degree view of everything. The seat itself seems like it might be some kind of cardboard on top of an air cushon, so the cardboard-like surface isn't that comfortable, but I got a blanket for my dog to lay on. The only other thing is that I have to keep blowing up the air cushion every other day, so I wish they could have just used some kind of cotton pillow there instead. But if you don't mind having to keep blowing up the cushion, it's an otherwise great product."
2,boring real quick,"I enjoy strategy games, especially war strategy quite a bit, but this game doesn't require strategy. There is practically no one who has enough strategy to beat this game. The designers wanted only God himself to be able to win certain battles. Even if it was easier you would find yourself bored within a few days of buying it. Not much of anything is good about this game."
5,Cheap great DVD player / very good VCR too!,"I bought this cause I was looking for a good DVD player that can playback WMA files on DVD. This DVD player has a super solid WMA DVD playback support, with programming of individual tracks and random playback of programmed tracks! In addition its a solid player for DVD+-R media I have thrown at it! To me the VCR is a bonus for such a solid DVD player. I don't have much VHS tapes, but those I popped in looks good enough... not exactly progressive DVD but hey, its VHS, what do you expect?"
4,Two years later and I still love it,"My wife bought this two years ago to replace using my ps2 as a dvd player. We use it at least once a week and we have been very pleased. We haven't had any problems with the VCR and the DVD player stopped working for about a week, but came back and we haven't had any problems since. Plus, since it's progressive scan it looks great on an HD TV."
1,avoid this machine!!,"We have owned this dvd/vcr combo player for about 9 months now. It is awful! The DVD player in particular is very poor. Often, the video will freeze, but the audio will continue and it will ""skip"". Also, many DVD's do not played properly. One movie that has the deleated scenes added back in will stop playing whenever it comes to an extra scene. Other times it will continue to play as it is supposed to. Also, home made DVD's with multiple chapters will sometimes play only the first chapter, sometimes not. On my dauaghters Baby Einstein, it will often only play the Spanish version and not allow us to access the DVD menu to play it in English. Other times it will. It is so inconsistant that it is unreliable. The VCR seems to function properly, although it is not used as often."
4,Love it!,"This is the 5th stroller I've tried since adding twins to my family. And I've finally found the one! It is great. It is easy to load and unload, it has trays and plenty of leg room for the little ones. And as an added bonus, my ""small sized"" preschooler can also ride on the back of this stroller similar to the sit n' stands. I'm trying to get my husband to build her a little shelf to stand on, but it hasn't happened yet, she just stands on the axel and off we go. It's easy to steer, lighter than any other I tried and the stadium seating is nice too. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because there is not a cup holder and the huge (positive!) basket is a little hard to get to. But overall, it gets the job done easily!"
5,Loved it for 20 years,Bought my first bottle of this WONDERFUL parfum at Caesars Palace 20 years ago and have never tired of it. All who come in contact with me also love the scent. Do not hesitate to try. Very fresh and not overpowering. Foral!
5,I don't really know what to say,"I am completely lost for words for this album. All I can say is that this is probably the single most beautiful album I have heard all year and in a really, really long time as well.Don't worry about taking the risk of buying this one even without the sound examples in Amazon, this album is pure sonic sensual overload!This is the type of music that would come out if M83, My Bloody Valentine, Boards of Canada, Merkin Dream, Four Tet and Manitoba where all locked up in a room and were forced to make music in order to save their lives; full of longing, sadness and blissfull joy.An album like this only comes once in a while and when it does, it seems to take you back to a place you've never been before.Enjoy..."
4,Pretty patterns,"Schnauss effectively works a rare synthesized electronica consisting of equal parts Boards of Canada mystique, M83 sheen, and Moby danceability. His sophomore is a tight set of beautiful work, steeped in patterned accessibility but keenly produced and emotionally engaging enough to add extra dimension."
5,Excellent Chill Ambient,"Hmmm... Never wanted to be one of those people that gives out 5 stars all the time but I don't want such a great CD to have lower ratings than mainstream drek, so 5. This is a really good ambient album, if you like chill instrumentals you just might enjoy this. Less mainstream or accessable than say an Enya or Enigma, more akin to Slowdive, sans vocals. I had to immediately buy this album after the first time I heard A Letter from Home. My favorite ambient song since Aim's - Cold Water Music or FC Kahuna's - Hayling, simply beautiful."
5,again masterful.,"more mature than far away trains (FAT) without losing quality or emotion. whereas FAT has very consistent track themes (gradual layering), SIP varies percussion and introduces more diversity in sounds. beautiful music."
5,Amazing Electronica....,"This is one of the top IDM(Intelligtent Dance Music) cds ever released. I have a LOT(close to 200 cds) of electronica music and this release and FAT(Far Away Trains Passing By) are in my top 10 of all time. I can't believe more people do not know about this guy. If you like any type of electronica buy this NOW! both cds blow away 95 percent of current music being produced.BTW, if you like this cd, buy M83's latest cd called; DeadCitiesRedSeas&LostGhosts...same; sort of dreamy lush synth strings...almost as good as Schnauss!"
4,... if you can get more than 3 good songs. It's a great album.,"Not to undermind Ulrich Schnauss's genius. This is a great album, but only 3-4 songs stand out as being purely great! Worth owning... and now just waiting for another album to come out."
2,vanilla flavor with a little chocolate,"I blindly purched this cd based on the fact that there were two tracks on his last release (far away trains)that I really really liked. ""Strangely Isolated Place"" isn't a bad release, but sorry to say, I am disappointed. I really wanted there to be that one or two tracks that just reached out and grabbed me like on his previous cd, but it didn't happen. There are a few somewhat interesting moments, but overall (as with his other cd)most of the tunes are rather flat and mundane. It's like wanting to see mountains but only getting a hillside view. He teases the listener with subtle chord changes that last a second or two, then reverts back to mundane, vanilla sounding compositions."
4,"Beautiful pics, through kind of slow","My husband and I were very excited to watch this. The parts where they showed the actual baby in the womb were very beautiful and exciting, but sometimes the narrative dragged on. Still, I consider it worth the money and informative."
5,National Geographic - In the Womb,The absoulte best experience of what's happening during a pregnancy. Great narrator and fantastic pictures.Unbeliveable what can be filmed and put together. Me and my wife watched this film and gained substansial more knowledge and understanding. We watched it week by week following our own pregnancy which gave an nice feeling to it. This is what's happening to our baby right now!
5,Incredible,I'm in my 22 week of pregnancy and I first saw this program on television and was so pleased to find it on Amazon! I purchased it right away and even recieved it early. It is an incredible journey and so amazing to see it from this perspective! Thank you!
5,Loved It,I enjoyed watching this documentary. I have never been a mother however I bought this for my sister since it was her first pregnancy. We watched this documentary together and just fell in love with the little girl in mommy's womb. It gave new meaning to the development process of a baby during the nine months of pregnancy.
3,Mostly Computer Graphics,"I was hoping to see more actual footage in National Geographic's ""In the Womb"". While this film was mostly about the developing fetus, out of the entire film, only a few minutes of actual 4D sonograms were shown. The film was fascinating and informative, but I didn't realize that it was going to be mostly computer graphics. Some moments, I thought I was looking at a real fetus in the womb, but most of the time it looked comletely fake."
5,Great Gift,This was a great gift. I bought this for a couple who were pregnant with their first child. They said the video was wonderful and informative. It made them enjoy the wonder of their pregnancy even more.
3,Underwhelming,"I was a bit disappointed by this documentary, especially after reading so many reviews about how amazing it is.As other reviewers have mentioned, long stretches of this film feature the same dozen computer-animated clips played over and over again while the narrator offers vague, general information. I would have liked to hear more statistics and comparative data -- the narrator rarely even mentioned how big the fetus was at different stages. There were a lot of rapid-fire cuts, footage of fluid rushing through the lungs, and unexplained belly-cam shots, but I was expecting more substantive information. You won't get anything from this documentary that you don't get in one of those week-by-week pregnancy emails. The 4-D scans were fascinating, but there were not many of them.In all, this film was a disappointment."
4,Very informative,"My wife and I bought this for some extra insight into her pregnancy and I must say that it is most informative.I believe that many modern documentaries are looking for PG ratings so that young members of our world may watch without being afraid. The documentary does not go into details of what could go wrong or any issues such as that. Instead, it focuses on what happens in a typical pregnancy. They even show a birth and it happens to be a very pg-13 sort of birth. Great for introducing curious youngsters to how all of this works, though if I were reading this, I would preview it before showing my youngsters to see if it was right for me.In my humble opinion, this is an excellent modern documentary."
3,Pretty good,"This is obviously a beautiful phenomenon. I bought it to show my 8th grade class during our ""Worth-the-Wait"" unit. I was pleased, for the most part. My only complaint would probably be something that National Geographic is pretty well known for. There were many scenes that would flash back and forth so fast that it was hard to get a grasp of what was going on at any one moment. And then there were many scenes that were interesting to look at, but not explained well or at all. However, for every scene that was confusing or overwhelming, there would be another that was perfectly clear and wonderfully explained. So I would recommend it, just don't prepare for complete understanding."
4,good information resource,"this video gave a lot of information on the development of the fetus, much from the perspective of the fetus and its experiences and sense development. A lot of cutting-edge study and simulation. I would have liked to see a bit more actual footage, as opposed to computer graphics, but the graphics were well-done."
2,Chris,"Very goood service however after it arrived in Australia the delivery service was not that great, took as long to get from the US to Australia as it did fromd the airport to collection point._there should however be a note from seller that this video may not work in Australian DVD players, I had to purchase a new DVD player to play the DVD."
1,Be aware - not recordable in Europe !,"The DVD is formatted for USA only ! I paid $47,96 for express shipping and handling. When the DVD arrived it was not compatible with my new DVD player bought in Norway. Amazon immediately refunded the DVD cost, but could not help me with the shipping cost. I still haven't been able to see the film. Kind regards Julianne"
1,Awful,"Annoyingly fake Jamaican accents, all too predictable Bob Marley cliche-ridden lyrics, insipid melodies, and insufferably droning bass lines which might well drive Aston Barrett out of the room all conspire to render this ""band"" the title of ""Worst Reggae Band Ever"". This begging, spiritless bunch needs to get real or go away."
5,Eye opening,This book has nothing shy of a confirmation of all of my feelings of all aspects of challenges all of us are confronted with!!
1,"Well-written, but misleading","The book is very readable, but the information is biased towards the upside of network marketing (NWM). From experience & careful research, without hesitation I can tell you his conclusions are incorrect. After subtracting all expenses, less than one of 50 networkers ever earn a profit, and if you subtract the NWM products that would not have been purchased had the person not gotten into a given NWM program, the vast majority of participants lose money. Though legal because legitimate products are offered, NWM is still a pyramid scheme, a key point Poe (and the entire industry) ignores. Only a few at the top of any pyramid can succeed, supported by the ""losers"" beneath them. The book is readable, but provides very misleading information --since the downside of NWM is not given to balance the rare success stories he relates."
3,Network marketing can't apply in Hong Kong,"It is good to sell the dream of freedom to Hong Kong people, but actually, no one knows if you can gain large sum of money after you invest your money and efforts in this company.Also, there are many illegal companies, which are working as MLM structure, i.e. pyramid scheme. Those companies are rather people oriented than product oriented. Before they enter the company, they need to pay a large sum of entrance fees, and they earn bonus by referring the scheme to people, but not recruiting sales representatives to earn commissions by selling products. Very often, those companies easily wind up. Hong Kong people are mixing up the concepts of these companies with those legitimate MLM companies, such as, Amway, Nu Skin and Mary Kay. Therefore, most of the Hong Kong people are not faithful to the MLM companies as they are too risky for them to join."
3,Network Marketing seems too ideal in this book,"The author stated that the future development of network marketing, i.e. Wave Four will dominate the market, it means that all the companies will be working as the structure of network marketing . It is not necessary for them to spend money on advertising, but they would much depend on people¡s network to have a word of mouth communication about the company. But actually, if the company is newly entered, how can it attract the people to be its downlines? In our opinion, promotions, e.g. advertising, are needed to inform the people about this company.The author only talk about the pros of network marketing, but the fact is that it is pyramid scheme and only the upline (at the top of pyramid) can gain large revenue, but not the downline, as those income of uplines are supported by the downlines who below them."
1,Incompatible with the XBox 360!!,"Be careful: this is one of the few original-xbox games that has never gotten a 360 compatibility patch and CANNOT BE PLAYED ON THE XBOX 360. I wasted my money -- don't waste yours. :-(UPDATE: It's just been announced that a new HD version of the game is being produced for the 360 which will be out sometime in 2011. So I would definitely not recommend buying this!UPDATE: The new version is out. There is really very, very little reason to buy this product now. Wish I'd saved my money!"
4,A fun adventure game.,"This game has a beautiful world to offer. In my opinion, it bests the Final Fantasy series's last dozen installments in terms of sheer originality. The combat is enjoyable, if a little too simple (Ninja Gaiden this ain't), and the storyline is also very engaging. This is also one of the few games that succeeds at constantly divvying up the quest between action, puzzle, and exploration elements of gameplay. You could play this seriously as an adult or with younger kids.It's a shame that a lot of people ignored it when it first came out, but now that the price dropped, maybe you will pick it up like I did. It may not be HALO or GTA, but it is definitely worth the $25. A neat little title to spend some quality time with."
3,What's all the hububb about?,"This is one of those cult favorites, like psychonauts or shadow of the colossus. The only problem is it's not nearly as good as either of those games. I guess beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but this game never did it for me."
4,Good Move,"It is fun and english subtitles, it is chinese but funny alot of slapstick and a nice looking girl that well make your eyes bulg"
3,Not as good as 'Kung Fu Hustle' but still has its moments!,"Definitely for 'Kung Fu Hustle' fans (especially with the Landlady and her husband also costarring here!), though not nearly as good ... but still quite funny, and even with a serious storyline, within the humor, that will touch the heart. Not so sure I liked the ending - it felt sort of rushed/cut off - but overall a fun film, though I now wish I knew how to play Mahjong so could have understood those scenes a bit more!"
2,Fairly dissapointed,"I was extremely excited for this knife to come, and although it was sharp, it has absolutely no weight to it. I am a professional chef, and bought it to use in my kitchen, so maybe it would suffice for the at home cook, but it just doesnt have a good feel to it, and I felt like I wasted $70 dollers."
4,light to use,"It's good for home users because this knife is light and sharp enough almost for everything.But it 's not a good choice to cut fruits, especially watermelon."
5,Wusthof 7inch knife,This is the knife I SHOULD have had all the while I was feeding a family of 5!! It is VERY sharp and cuts everything like it is cutting butter.Delivery was fast and easy. Nothing negative to say at all.
4,Definitely at crowd pleaser!,"This has to be at least one giant step ahead of any other action game on the planet. The third person scenario adds to the enjoyment and Duke's comments are killers.... With the significant number of skill levels, the game levels and the one-on-one levels this is fun for hours and hours and hours."
2,Not like Duke Nukem 3D,"I would not recommend this game to anyone expecting an experience like Duke Nukem 3D for the PC. The gameplay is very different and hard to get used to, and the voice acting is not on par with the original. The game is also very frustrating; expect to spend a lot of time falling off of ledges and getting killed because Duke is very hard to control. However, if you enjoy the Tomb Raider games then this will probably work for you. But hardcore Duke Fans, stay away from it!!! I'm sure Duke Nukem Forever will be out soon enough....(I hope)"
2,The duke's first 3rd person game,This game was a real let-down for me. I really dislike the 3rd person camera. And it takes me forever to aim. I own all duke nukem games and this is the worst. Look for something else.
1,Time to play something better,"Thier is abosultly no reason to play this over any good fps, Duke Nukem game or Die Hard, aside from some novelty from the vs mode.Its nto an awful game, its just like a Duke Nukem game but not as good. I never understand why games like this even existed. It was outdated before it came out, and I doubt the years have been kind"
1,Beware,"This company offers overpriced screens and is unresponsive and unfriendly to customers who have a problem. If you want a less expensive screen protector of simiilar quality, try Clarivue."
1,Solitude: The Art of Living with Yourself,"I was rather disappointed with this and many other pop-psychological books based on this concept of having to love ourselves before we can love others........Scripture shows us that ""No man yet hateth his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it."" In reality if you really hated yourself , you would be glad that you are such and so.......and what happens to those decieved by such psuedo-religious and psyco-babble find themselves more lonley and consumed with self and no room to really love thy neighbor as themselves........When one gets up in the mourning, you shower, eat and generally take care of yourself....so love thy neighbor as thyself.......The title itself is rather revealing......"
2,It's Okay,"The book is kinda good in c++ programming, but I think that VB is A MUCH BETTER CHOICE for game programming. C++ is used to make more powerful tools but let's face it. How can your games look good if you can't design them with the eye. VB ROCKS!!!"
1,DO NOT buy this useless book!,"I really hate this book it think is very hard to understand,Andre just throws a bunch of code at you and doesnt rally tell yo what to do with it. I got confused and contacted Andre and he was a real jerk to me and insulted me. I do not like him or his book. So DO NOT buy this book!"
4,Good for starters,"This book is not a COMPLETE guide on writing games in Windows. It would take an entire library to handle such a topic in a thorough manner. Rather, this book gets you started down the road to windows programming and directx. Be forwarned, though, that there are a few errors in the code listed in the book (a missing (HBRUSH) cast being the most notorious), and that the final result of the book is a directx wrapper that is supposed to be a game engine. On the plus side, this book has the single best windows api crash course I have read to date, and Andre has a great style of writing, so you won't get bored with the material. You will learn the BASICS of directx, but will definitely need to suppliment your knowledge with some other source (I suggest the internet)."
3,O.K.,The content of this book was pretty good but the format in which it was done was apalling. It should have been done in the (sams) 21 day format it would have made it a lot clearer. The author did well to handle such a vast subject.
5,"CLEAR, FUN and POWERFUL","Well, I love this book. I really had no experience in windows programming and other books were too serious to be easily understandable. Andrè Lamothe is a special person, because he has the knowledge and he his able to explain the most complex things in an easy and fun way; if only other programmers could be able to share their knowledge this way then you will need half the time to learn whathever you want. Mr. Lamothe please go on!"
5,Great book!,"The perfect starting book for anyone wanting to learn directx basics or how to make a fairly simple game. Andre's explanations are very down to earth, quite entertaining at times, but still peppered with enough detail to help anyone. (unless of course you don't know how to code!) Andre rocks!!!(Pun was intended.) So follow this book up with his new book published on Sep 17."
4,best directx programming book!,i must truly say this is one of the best directx programming books out there. The cd-rom is one of the most helpful i have ever tried. if you are a beginner just getting started in the world of programming this is a must buy!
3,Ok in its day probably but far too outdated now,"Bought this a couple years back. Unfortunately, with DirectX 8 currently (with major revisions nontheless), this book is of little use currently unless you want to learn and develop in ancient technology. Your time and money would be better spent learning DirectX 8 IMHO though..."
1,Beginners need not apply!,"This book is labeled wrong. I don't know anything about anything when its comes to game programming. And since this book is label for dummies, I thought it would really teach me and guide me as a dummy about game programming. The author simply does not teach the fudamentals and he doesn't take you by the hand. I couldn't follow what he was doing in this book. This book is not for dummies, but for experienced people who wants to program in windows. Maybe somebody else can write a book entitled, Game Programming 101!"
5,This book is great!,"This book made me realize how powerful DirectX really was. With this book, you are able to understand how to create your own video games. It also has a chapter on how to publish your game, once you have completed it. One of my favorite sections in this book is 'The Part of Tens' where the author lists the ten basic rules of game design and the ten biggest mistakes game programmers make. This book is definitely a must-have."
3,Appropriate Title,"At first I thought the book was great... it seemed to explain things very well. However the problem is that the code and examples he gives you only work on certain things and in certain situations... For instance, the 16-bit programs don't work on my computer (with an GeForce2 Card btw). Therefore, if you're a dummie and have no aspirations of writing programs different from the one lamothe provides, buy it... otherwise, dont! also some of the info is old and converting to directx 7 is a pain. I would tell you what book to buy but im still looking... maybe ""inside directX"""
4,the best way to get started!,"This book is really good for a begginer just getting into the world of game programming. It describes every aspect of game programming, and does a great job of making DirectX easy and entertaining. It even comes with 2 simple sample games and a game engine to make your first games easy. It also goes into a lot of detail about how DirectX and Windows works. But beware! the parts on DirectX can be very confusing if you skim. I also would have liked it if the author gave more code samples in the book itself so you can see how it all works. Nevertheless, if you want an introduction to the world of DirectX with C++, buy it. Oh, and get Visual C++ because it took me hours to get the game engine to work on my Metrowerks Codewarrior. That's what real game programmers use anyway. Enjoy!"
4,Informative and humorous,"Just because this is a ""...for dummies"" book, doesn't mean it's for dummies. This book is what is says: ""Windows Game Programming"", not ""Programming"" or even ""Game Programming"". What I'm getting at is that this book will teach you how to get a simple game going in Windows, not teach you how to program. He states that he will assume that you are at least familiar with the C programming language with no Windows programming experience.That being said, I found this book very informative and easy to follow. Mr. LaMothe approaches each subject as an objective to achieve, instead of just something that must be learned."
5,The best DirectX tutorial for beginners yet!,"This book is awesome! After this one and the old ""Teach Yourself Game programming in 21 days"", Andre LaMothe has become my favorite author! From the beginning in this book he explains the essence of Windows programming, you will get into it even if you have never programmed in Windows environment before. On the CD he has many examples, sources and binaries, as well as shareware programs and bonus artwork which you can use in your own games! THe best part on the CD is the 2d game engine code (DirectX wrapper) which you can modify and use to write your own game. Trust me on this one, if you have never programmed in indows before, this is THE book to start.Thanks Andre for another excellent book. :)"
5,Rockin!,"I tell yah, that space_ant guy is a wierdo. This is the best book on the topic of programing directX windows games. Yeah, WINDOWS!!! So why don't you go off in the corner and cry You DOS IDIOT! Ok, that wasn't very nice. I'm sorry. This is a great book. Yes, he uses wrapper functions, but he tells you how DirectX works and how to program for it before he gives you the Wrappers. I will recommend this book till I'm blue in the face. Simply the best, better than all the rest. And this is a pretty funny book to. He doesn't talk like a text book. He talks like a cool guy, in which he is, I've talked to him quite a few times. Anyway, his style isn't like Vulcan, for a rock writing. And that's my point on that. It definatley deserves 5 starts"
1,Not a good book,"Lamothe should be ashamed of himself. The book s**ks. Many statements made are either completely incorrect and just plain ignorant.For instance, the author assumes that all 16-bit modes are 5-5-5, when they are most definately NOT. If you program with his method, your game will NOT work."
1,This book is not as good as you think,This book is sopposed to have it all. But reading the reports says you must know C or C++. Well that is not cool. I want a book I can read and start programming from no other knowledge.
1,No MFC? Hardly Any C++? C is in the stone age.,"The author is a C programmer who doesn't realize the power of C++ and it's reusabilty. The author also does not realize the power of MFC. He has a little column in which he says MFC is to hard so he won't include it in his book. He is actually set in his ways with the old style of Windows programming in the SDK format and in C. It would not be so hard if the author would actually get some practice in MFC and stop knocking what he obviously hasn't had that much practice in. MFC and the VC++ class wizard would make this so much easier. The author is still stuck in the stone age. I wish I hadn't bought this book. I am anxious for the book DirectX Complete With CDROM by James Boer and Michael Root. It won't be available till November 98. From the synopsis it will use the AppWizard in VC++ and use MFC and C++ the way any true Windows program should, game or not,for reusabilty and maintenace."
2,Good book for one with a LONG attention span,"... I just started programming 2 years ago I learned BASIC, Perl, MySQL (if you call that a language), JavaScript, And I have known HTML since I was 6 or 7. So I decided to try and learn C/C++. I was pretty good at C And C++ Because of all the languages I already know. The whole reason I got into programmingwas to program GAMES. I tried this book because I saw at 75% off books. The book says to use Visual C++...""You should pick it up at your local computer store ....I dont have that kind of money and my compiler (DEV-C++) gives me errors when I compile it. The book does not tell how to install DirectX at all. Also if you buy the book and plan to make the next Metal Gear Solid 2 that night...DONT, the code to even make a window is about 3 pages long."
5,GREAT BOOK!,"This book is the best book I have ever read on game programming. If you have never programmed a game, but have programmed in C or C++ for DOS, and want to do game programming for Windows I would recommend this book. The book is not hard to understand, even if you are new to C programming. It covers the basics of Windows progamming, DirectDraw, DirectSound, and DirectInput without all the unnecessary details. BUY THIS BOOK!"
4,Excellent place to start in DirectX programming,"This book is great for beginning DirectX programmers! The reader must know C and some windows programming however. The author touches on some very basic windows programming, but then gets into DirectX and how to use it in your games. The book is easy to follow but much of the source code is on the CD which is a bummer when you are reading where there is no computer available. The author includes many wrapper functions that you can use; I prefer not to but they help in learning. The DirectSound section was limited. Again, a great book to start out and get your feet wet!"
5,An awsome book from a superb author!,"This book has got to be the best one of its catagory on the market. The text is very to the point, and the code is extremely clean. The code is so clean that you have to make sure you have your compiler set up correctly for it to run properly. The reason I know this, is because I talked to the author on the phone, and he talked me through my problems. How many other authors do you know that will do that? I have a complete library of game programming books, and this one is by far the most useful for creating 2D games of any sort. Even though the book doesn't cover tile based scrolling, the basics are there and with the DirectX SDK help and samples you should have no trouble. I only wish the author would have written more, but I know he was limited because it was a Dummies book. Maybe he'll write another book on 2D soon. My point is, BUY THIS BOOK!!!"
2,A good beginning,"The book is a good beginning to game programming, but it is far from flawless. For example, the first third of the book is almost completely irrelevant to the subject, and the code is often sloppy and poorly tested. Also, the engine and sample programs are in C as opposed to C++. It's hard to imagine any serious software development being done in C in this day and age."
4,"Basically a ""customizable"" game engine","The author does spend much time talking about DirectX and the basics of its workings, but in the end (if you're like me), you skip the first half of the book of confusing explanations and head for the chapters on the included graphics engine. Here, a basic shell is given to you for which to write games without the headaches of dealing with Windows programming. And if you dare, you could mess with the engine's .h files to alter the windows code and customize it a bit.Unfortunately, the author describes little on midi and anything on string output and input; not a good thing if you're looking to write rpg's. Otherwise a nice intro book."
3,Definately not for anyone who has never programmed before.,I assumed that this book would teach me everything I ever wanted to know about creating computer games. Boy did I mess up big time! I couldn't figure out what the author was talking about. He may as well have been speaking Greek. Next time I'll surf the web before I purchase another book on game programming. SHAME ON ME!
4,"Great for beginners, but...","This book is great for those new to Windows game programming and DirectX. André covers all elements of DirectX 5.0, with the exception of Direct3D. His writing style is easy and enjoyable to read, with a lot of sample code, which, although not perfect, is good for educational purposes. The disadvantage to this book is it is becoming rather dated, so you're probably better off with LaMothe's Tricks of the Windows Game Programming Gurus, which is more recent, about twice as big, and covers everything this book does."
5,"Great for new ""game programmers"" not new ""programers""","This book provides a perfect window into game programming. I've written all the boring text applications I'll ever need to and I wanted some insider knowledge on how to turn programming knowledge into game programming knowledge. Andre's book provided the answers. Excellent introduction to Win32 and GDI, excellent explanation of COM, and excellent stuff on DirectDraw. And if you want even more help, use Andre's graphics/sound/input library that he created to wrap around DirectX to make it even easier to use. I've already created a Tetris like puzzle game using Andre's engine. The next step for me is to buy his more advanced book and see how far that will take me. An excellent introduction to game programming."
3,"Good, but not great","The book starts out great, with clear step-by-step explanations about everything. One really begins to feel like they're getting somewhere. However, just over half way through, the author abandons this step-by-step approach and dumps a massive 'library' of code in front of you with little explanation, and leaves you for dead. From here, one is expected to tinker with the existing code, making alterations as necessary to fit one's own idea for a game. A very disappointing conclusion to what started out as a great book."
2,Game programming at its worst...,"I bought this book because I thought it would be a good place to start in the world of DirectX game programming. But, this book just seemed to drag on and on, and didn't really explain everything in the best of details. You might pick up one thing here and another thing there, but its not really worth the money. I must have spent half of my time trying to figure out one tiny thing, and I ended up looking around for tutorials. If you want a good book on DirectX, you probably wont find one. I do however suggest reading Microsoft's DirectX 8 documentation, which includes great examples and everything you will ever need. For a paper reference, you should also get Microsoft's ""Inside DirectX"". It might be a little outdated and a tiny bit advanced at times, but it does help in many situations since DirectX will always look and feel the same with every version."
4,AWESOME book...wished it had better 16-bit support though...,"This was an absolute awesome book. I typically love Lamothe's books. He really knows how to get the point accross and always puts a little humor into it. His tutorial games (with complete source) are very good (simple 2-D games like DigDug) and use his famous GDUMB engine. Remember though, this book uses DX5 which is outdated. However, it's still a great book to add.My only complaint was the lack of 16-bit color support. While he does cover it and even has some code, most of the book deals with palettes. Of course when this book was written, 16-bit wasn't as common. He also states that most 16-bit cards use the 5-5-5 scheme (which his 16-bit codes uses).Basically, if you don't have this book, BUY IT NOW! -Cecil"
2,Half fast job...,"This book isn't what i expected. I expected this to teach me DirectX instead it throws functions at me, and shows an example. For the complete program of each function, I look on the CD and theres lines of code he hasnt covered and doesnt bother to explain. Andre Lamothe does a half fast job of explaining DirectX. I give this 2 stars because I was enjoying the book up until Chapter 9. His Windows coverage was very good. This book is 3 years old now, but thats now excuse for the poorly described code."
3,Something not quite right,Okay this is the deal. The book is based on direct X 6 or something. Too out dated. I bought the book for the direct X stuff but I realised the documentaion that comes with direct X are easy enough to learn from. This books only good as a game programming. You learn some neat tricks and ideas....
5,The best way to learn windows game programming,"LaMothe is great at showing you how to use DirectX, and windows. He knows how to explain windows programming without going into details you don't want to know. You do have to know the basics of C and have Windows 95, 98 or NT. LaMothe also gives you a game engine to use, and tips for making games. The book, however, doesn't have any Direct3D stuff in it, so you'll have to be content with a side scroller or something like that, but if this is your first Windows game programming book,(or if you like reading plain English) get it."
1,THE FIRE PIT,I WOULDN'T BUY THIS ITEM... IT DID NOT COME WITH A FIRE GRATE AND THAT IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF ANY FIRE PIT. WITHOUT ONE THE BOWL WILL NOT LAST AS LONG. YOU CAN NOT FIND A ROUND FIRE GRATE ANYWHERE IN THE AFTER MARKET....
2,Rusted after 1 month,"We had a few bbq's with this firebowl however only after a month it is rusted. The cover started melting after we set the fire, so quickly we removed it and don't use it.It is the cheapest firebowl you can find but if you want quality find something more expensive."
4,Firebowl,"Good product for the price, it was for my family as a gift, they love it.Would recommend to others."
3,The Bond Between a Father and Son,"Before it Hits Home was a heart tugger the entire book. It grabbed your attention at the very beginning and did not let go until the end, and even then did not want to let go. You will have to take a few moment to regoup your emontions at the end. This story told of the love of a Mother and Son, but really brought out the the unspoken bond between a father and son. It digs deep into the family grabs you and hold you close to its heart."
2,At Least It's A Flying Game For Playstation...,"It's nice to have a air combat game with the sea of driving games for the PlayStation. I would hope they could at least apply some of the attention-to-detail the driving games get. The planes handle like crap (the F-117 stalls at any change in direction and speed), air speed is slow, the flight ceiling is just higher than the roof of your house, and the weapons are far from true-to-life. The F-14 is a lumbering bullet like in real life, but the F-14 was created to carry the Phoenix Air-To-Air missile that can be fired from hundreds of miles away, yet you have to get your F-14 into dogfight situations (it was not meant for that) to lock on at 1000 yards because that's the magic number for any aircraft in the Air Combat game. For $15 it's not a bad game, but I beg and plead for a gaming company to put out a real fighter-combat simulator for the PlayStation."
3,A good game that won't appeal to everyone.,"Graphics: 6/10 – Not too flash really, there isn’t much to look at here. The aeroplanes look nice when you’re checking out which one to fly in, but in the air, it’s mostly just a nice shade if blue.Sound: 6/10 – I can remember the background plane noises, but the shooting sounds could’ve been more bang-crash-WAM!Value: 5/10 – If you play a lot of games that are based around things in the air or aeroplanes, this isn’t the pick of the litter. It is worth buying for a price under $..., but you might not be interested if you aren’t willing to get fly-wise.Overall: 6/10 – Definitely not a poor game, it will teach you with its intelligence how to fly a simulator plane, but don’t expect the entertainment level to be through the roof."
2,outdated,"This game does not have many of the features I've found in other flight games. The planes fly like bricks. No afterburners. Not even dual shock control compatable. Crap. But for 15 bucks, it could be a lot worse. The music couldn't, but the game could."
4,surprisingly well made,"I read the reviews for other hot wheels toys, so I was sceptical about this one. But it turns out to be well-made and full of fun for my 5yo boy. It does take some assembly, but the pieces snapped together nicely, and are staying in place. The racetrack lets you race two cars side by side with a nice push buttton launcher that is, thankfully, not battery operated. Only one car is included, but my son found another compatible hot wheels car in his collection. There are a bunch of other built-in gadgets - I wish there were some written instructions that explained the purpose of them all, but so far my son is having fun figuring it all out."
1,Very loud and poorly designed machine.,"This is a very loud machine when operated on all washing cycles. All spin cycles are worse. Gets out of balance very easily. This machine has a hot water option, but will not allow you to use it. There is a energy saving device installed to prevent you from using very hot water. This machine automatically adds twenty percent cold water during the hot cycle. There is a safety device which prevents you from opening the lid during the washing cycle. I talked to a appliance salesman at Lowes department store who told me that this machine is 20 percent greener. He said that this machine uses less hot water, less water and energy. I now wash all my laundry thru two complete washing cycles to get all the soap out. I bought the matching dryer which I like very much.I"
4,Good washer at a very good price,"I have owned this washer for 3 years. It was inexpensive, and washes my laundry well.Works flawlessly, I have not had a problem. Uses hot water, so I does not consume too much electricity.Easy to set up, does what it is supposed to do: in my opinion, most of the fancy programs you find on some washers are unused anyway, and this has a simple dial that makes washing easy.A good buy."
4,This Book Is Great,"If you lived and grew up in Washington and the Northwest in the 60's, this book is for you.I picked it out, read it, and it brought back so many memories of the 60's and 70's for me. It took my back through my youth, my high school days and the fun we had.I listened to KJR faithfully until they changed their format and then I was so sad and went to another station. Now I'm back though and ...........read the book then put in you review here."
3,Please hire an editor next time!,"I grew up in Seattle during the Pat O'Day era and really enjoyed a lot of the background stories, but the book was ruined by the massive number of mistakes that even a mediocre editor/proofreader could have fixed. It's really unforgiveable. I would have done the job for free."
1,Hard cover with a hard read,"Yikes! I thought I'd get some great reading according to some of the other reviews I read about this book. Pat O'Day obviouslyhas a lot of friends. The book, while serving up some memories fond memories of my teenage years in Seattle was a tough with a desperate need for a professional editor. While I too found some some of the stories funny and entertaining for the most part it simply about a man and his out of control ego. Very poor for the buck."
5,It Was All Just Rock And Roll,This book is simply wonderfull. It brings those years of rock and roll and radio's infancy to life. The writer also has a great sense of humor because he seemed to see the fun side of things. Here is a total insider that tells rock and roll and radio stories as only one who has been there can!The book also is the first I've read to tell the story of the real Jimi Hendrix! I couldn't put it down.
2,"Why didn't you just stick to the rock n roll then, Pat?","I was excited to read this. I grew up in the Northwest but on the wrong side of the mountains to hear KJR, but knew of its reputation as a '60s powerhouse. There are good, even great stories, but so-o-o much of it is Pat patting himself on the back. Add in all the stories of him and his buddies that are not radio or RnR related with the poor (non-existent?) editing and it ended up a long, long slog. But I read the whole thing.One bone I have to pick--I don't buy the story of Elvis needing to have ""an imitator behind the curtain"" on his later tours because Elvis couldn't hit the notes. You always read that the one thing that never deserted Elvis was his voice (""My Way"" was from his last tour!). Sounds like sour grapes to me--maybe Colonel Parker (who Pat admirably skewers) stiffed Concerts West? Whatever, I don't buy it and since Pat tells us it was one of his partners who went on the Presley tours and not Pat, it's hearsay and better left out."
1,O'Day makes hay in his memiors,"This is a book about ""Mr Crusin' 1966""(An LP record that was released in a yearly seriesto honor a dee-jay nationally - Mr O'Day won that year)Chapter after chapter this book's chewing gum for the eyes....even when you get to what may seem BORING parts, it picks you 'right' back up again like a shot of good Geritol as a 68year-old. There are stories galore and lots of very entertaining rock & roll history notes.However there are alot of missing links. There's not even one MENTION of Pat's national exposure fame via the Crusin' 66 record nor how THAT came to be - neither are there mentions of his later years in radio during the Northwest's hard economic times <BR.They also disregard including any kind of audio CD relating to this man's talent as a radio announcer, plus there's no glossary or index.Wait for the paperback - odds are you'll really feel good about this man - THEN."
3,Good non-academic overview of Soviet history,Recommended as an introductory examination upon the paradox that was the Soviet Union. I think this work should have touched a bit on the fundamental problems of industry (covered in a few paragraphs in Castell's 'End of Millennium) and of the regime's constant struggle with the intelligentsia.I acknowledge that an attempt to document the USSR in a single volume is a formidable task. In making this book friendly to a non-scholar decisive events are mixed with colorful anecdotes and occasional moralizing. (I think most of us do not need to be reminded that the deaths of 20 million people is bad thing.)A quick read but ultimately I could not find anything in the book to use in my 300 and 400-level Soviet history courses at university.
4,Crepe pan has many purposes,This non stick crepe pan is great for making crepes of all sizes. It is also great for frittatas and omelettes.Be careful to hand wash this non stick pan and to use a non stick spatula or be very careful not to scratch thenon stick surface. Bon appetite!
4,Good pan - much like a griddle,"I like this pan, I have used it much like a griddle. The sides aren't high, so it is easy to get under whatever you need to flip. The sides allow a free flowing batter to not fall off like many griddles. The pan has a good weight to it and is able to retain it's heat well.I gave this 4 stars because I thought all All Clad was made in the USA. This is made in China, probably along with the Emeril-ware, so I'm not sure if the quality will be as good or will hold up as long as I was expecting. Otherwise, it is a nice pan."
5,A great tool.,"Well balanced, unlike some other pans whose handles are too heavy or long. This nonstick finish works perfectly every time. A good piece to invest in for your kitchen."
5,"Love, Love, Love!!!","This is by far the best game I've ever played. I'm a huge fan of puzzle games that require you to actually think, not just fight. However, the fighting scenes are fun with all the great combos. The graphics in this game are UNBELIEVABLE! They're so realistic and just great to look at. I've played other games that require problem solving and fighting, but this one takes all! Another great thing about this game, is it's storyline. I really enjoyed the interaction between the prince and Farrah. They start off exchanging little quips at each other, but end up growing a deep connection (if only the ending was different...;))Anyways, if you're looking for a great game, get this one, you won't regret it!"
1,the most frusteratingly bad game ive ever played,"fun at some parts, but at others, its so hard that it takes all the fun out of it. if you want a real action game for the ps2, buy god of war or resident evil 4. they have fast paced action thats not lagged down by horrible gameplay."
1,BOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Im never going to make the mistake of of bying something for its cover again!I would have gave this game a zero but he computer wouldnt let me!Theres like no fighting in this game(well there is occasionaly) but it stinks and the whole game is basicaly one big puzzle.Dont even rent it.
3,Awesome graphics - gameplay frustrating...,"The graphics was one of the main reasons for getting this game. The acrobatics are awesome as well and so make the game more fun... until you start reaching levels where you can't beat anyone - you can't save the game - and when you get sick of trying to beat them and turn off the system, you've got to start the level all over again. Two buttons for fighting sequences just doesn't seem to be enough.I'm not a huge gaming freak but I enjoy my occasional gameplay, so it takes me more than 7 hours to beat a game... but when it gets frustrating, it gets exchanged for another game.I recommend that you rent - not purchase this game."
4,Awesomely Made!,"This game is really fun!!! You get to fight with swords against enemies! The first time I played, I felt it hard to get out of the first area in the game. But then it gets easier every time. The hard part now is to get the Dagger of Time."
3,good game too short tho,"I actually bought this game when reading a review of it. Ubisoft is pumping out some very good games this year but i DON'T recommend buying this one. There is no problem with the graphics. They are awesome every thing is fluid, from running on the walls to gymnastic flipping on the horizontal poles. The charecter physics are great. The camera is tricky sometimes but once you get the basics of what is physically possible on the game you work past the flaky camera. The combat system is suprisingly involved and fun, especially when you can turn your opponents into sand. The idea for the game along with the story is original (ie. speeding up time and rewinding it). long story short the game IS fun.I beat it in a weekend though with a total of 7 hours of game play. DON'T BUY IT, RENT IT!!"
3,Great Game But Too Short,Sands of Time is an incredibly fun game that keeps you interested and excited the whole the whole way through. My biggest complaint is that the whole way through isn't nearly long enough. I rented the game and after beating it I was left wanting more.
4,"WARNING- beautiful game, but hard","It is a wonderfully visual game, with a knock-out setup and great (when you can hear it) dialogue. But all the reviewers who claim the game is low frustration and easy... wrong! I adore this game, but I have never sworn at or threatened a game so much as this one. I was stuck on one fight for a month. I wish I was kidding. The big fights rely on timing and damn good luck, because sometimes you can make it the first time, and sometimes your sidekick dies fast and you will repeat the same fight infinitely. Too bad you can't skip ahead. Puzzles take time, but I only needed help with one. Seriously, the only flaw with this game is the fights."
3,One big jump puzzle,"If you like jump puzzles and fighting with enemies that arent as strong as you are then this is your game. I did enjoy this game but it didnt take that long to beat and most of it was jumping from place to place and pulling switches. It kind of reminded me of the Tomb Raider series but without the big bosses, the intricacy or the many varied locals (the game for the most part all takes place inside the sultans palace.) There was really only one big boss and that was at the very end of the game. The enemies werent all that hard to defeat once you get the hang of it. I would recommend renting this game but not purchasing it."
5,Bangin'!!!!!,"Okay first off I LOVE the prince, he is sooooo cute. And secondly this is one of the greatest games I've ever played! The animation is excellent,the storyline is awsome and the suspence is perfect! But this is something that irritates me...It's a very challenging game, you have to be a good stradigest, or just good at figuring things out because you have to plan out how to get to one thing from another. But still even if you're looking for a game just to play I would definately recommend this. Prince of Persia is BANGIN'!!!!"
2,Button mashing destroys a potential great game,"How could it be that a game designer like Jordan Mechner would allow button mashing endless fight sequences into what has the potential to be the greatest game ever for the PS2 or any other console? A great premise, gorgeous graphics, awesome character movement and abilities....and my copy is going up on ebay later today because the GAME IS UNPLAYABLE. I grew out of ""kill an endless stream of enemies to get to the save point"" at age 15. Button mashing hell. Avoid this game and wait for the next one in the series which will hopefully be an improvement."
2,D@NM i died again.,"this game has probably the worst camera angles and game controll i have ever seen. its not fun at all. all you do is die, rewind time, only to die again and again. if you like fusturating, annoying and migraine inducing video games then this one is for you. other wise look els were."
3,"very linear -- kill things, solve puzzle, repeat","Not sure why this game is getting such rave reviews.Ok, yes, the graphics are awesome, but...Very linear game play. Solve simple puzzle, kill things,solve simple puzzle, kill more things, repeat, repeat, repeat...Not a bad game, but not great either. Good rental, I think."
5,THE FIRST TIME !!!,"Well the Sands of Time, is the first of the saga, made in 2003. So the graphics are pretty well done for the time that was made, I personally love more the TWO TRONES, but the style of Sands of Time and Two Trones I really liked, the Warrior Within is the one that I didnt like that much."
3,"Nothing Special, But Good for Quick Fun","Well, I started Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time late Thursday/early Friday. Here it is late Friday/early Saturday and I just finished the game! Dude, that really was a seriously short game! It was mostly fun, though it features a lot of unbalanced battles at the start that can be very frustrating. The Sands of Time rewind affect is a nice tool to even up the odds, however, and to recover yourself if you mess up during any of the games many jumping/climbing challenges. The game story is interesting, though obviously very short with little depth. It does have a cute twist at the end, and the ending theme is very nice. All in all, though, this one has pretty much no re-playability since it is very very linear. Still, less than 10 hours of game play time to complete makes it nice ""mind candy"" between playing longer games."
4,ITS a classic,Prince of persia sands of time is a good mix of action and puzzles. The puzzles sometimes get a little nerve racking andwhen you finnaly do solve them you feel stupid that you didnt get it earlier. For $20 this is a good game even though its a few years old. This should be near the top on any list of great action games.
4,A joy to play and watch,"Stunning animation, movie-like camera and effects, fun gameplay, and wonderfully designed interactive environments make this one of the best games of the year. The voiceover narration is fantastic and I particularly enjoyed the charming and humorous comments on the ""game over/try again?"" screens. The music is nicely done with some standout pieces throughout the game; a nice touch is that the combat music changes every few levels which keeps things from getting stagnant.This game definitely is a ""platformer""; combat is fun but does get slightly repetitive, but this doesn't take away from the enjoyment of the game. A winner!"
3,Decent,"I can understand why someone who played this game in their childhood would have the warm and fuzzies. The relatively fluid combat system felt pretty solid considering the date of release. I like puzzles.However, when you're at the 25% mark and you can't help but think about whether or not you want to study for finals you don't really need to study for, this should be a red flag. I made it a little farther than the 50% mark and I've decided that I'm just too bored to continue playing.If you're not put off by repetitive gameplay and like to stare, wide-eyed, at pretty lights, this game just might be for you. Others might want to consider something else.I'd give it a 3 1/2 if I could.-C. Leonard"
4,I can't seem to get into the story,"This is a good RPG overall, but it has it's flaws. First of all, the story is very hard to get into, especially at the beginning, and the diolouge won't help you. The graphics were decent for it's time, but now they are not so good, but it's the quality, right? The magic system is one the worst I've seen, but it is needed. They're are 108 characters in this game, readers, don't be overwhelmed, a good majority of them are useless, so it will be easier to decide. Overall this is good, but it may not be for everyone. When you get a chance, run down to your video store and rent it, then you'll see."
3,Pretty Cool RPG,"This game is very average. The graphics are average, the story line is a little above average, and the game play is about average. This game was one of the best RPGs on Playstation when it came out about 4 or 5 years ago, but with games like Final Fantasy and Xenogears this game seems not as great as it once was. The cool thing about this game is the sheer amount of characters, which number more than 100, which is cool because it gives you many options. If you need a new RPG to play and already have played some of the better ones, you should probably give Suikodan a shot."
5,Suikoden is the BEST RPG EVER!,"I had read a preview for Suikoden 3 when the writer said, ""If your going to play Suikoden 3, play the first two first."" And so I did.This was the best advise I had ever taken. It is such a fun game. I've played Final fantasy 7-10, but this beats all of them. No where does the game go bad. Collecting all 108 characters was just a blast and was well worth the time. The game was a little short, (20 hours), but it was just too good.If you are an RPG fan, you have seen nothing if you havent played Suikoden yet.Buy it and play it and trust me, you will not be sorry!"
5,Best RPG,The best RPG I've seen! You go recruiting 108 stars of destiny. It was my favorite game until the 2nd one came out. If you dont have it GET IT!
5,Best game ever,"This is hands down my favorite game ever made... Sure it's kinda old by now and therefore not as fancy technology-wise, but the story is enough to keep me involved, and the fact that there are 108 distinct characters to recruit, PLUS all the NPCs that you don't recruit. Lots of personality. I can't even tell you how many times I've played through this... the second one is pretty good, too, but the first is definitely the best. A must-have for any true RPG fan."
4,like a dream come true,"Sukeoden (i spelt it wrong) is an awesome game in all respects but i'll give the bad news first and fast. it has bad grafics and a some really bad battle music and thats it.For the good news it has a really nice plot which unfolds slowly, in the game a friend dies and if you get 108 people to join your army( some of which are weak or just plain useless)he (or she ) is resorected,a really awesome army to army mode with tons of little guys running around and going to heaven as they are killed, an easy battle mode and you can change which noises you here whenever you open a scroll."
1,Too easy!,"Don't bother with Suikoden! The fights were always easy to win. I never died once in battle even the first time around. Zelda I was much tougher than this game! If you need an ego boost, get this game. Otherwise, save your money!"
5,love it,"the game was in good conditions when I got it and it play wounderfull on my ps3 overall I think this game is great, my best buy yet"
4,A game unfortunately overshadowed by Final Fantasy.,"Overall, this RPG was very well done. There were some things that could have been improved upon, such as graphics and more character development, but lessons were learned and the improvements were made in Suikoden 2.It's very hard to find this game nowadays, but it is worth playing. In the late 1990's, Konami's Suikoden 1 and Suikoden 2 were overshadowed by Square's releases of Final Fantasy 7,8, and 9, but these really were great games that never received the attention they deserved."
2,Mediocre at best.,"And that's being generous. I've never played a more lifeless, dull RPG. The dialogue comes off as if it was written by an autistic elementary schooler. I understand the sequel is supposed to be much better, but... I'm afraid I've been scared off for good."
3,Rattlemouth - 'Fistfull Of Iffy' (Cuneiform),"Coming to you from Richmond,VA,Rattlemouth is quite the distinctive sounding trio.The group skillfully brings together the elements of world music,folk and jazz.The trio's sound and music both are rather uplifting,witty and captivating.Notice that a lot of the sax playing appears to be very much in the foreground.Personally,I believe this will very much appeal to many fans/customers that purchase other Cuneiform label releases.Line-up:Danny Finney-vocals and sax,Tom Brickman-bass and Robbie Kinter-drums.Check it out when you get the opportunity."
5,stefy610,"Excellent book, truely one of her best! So many twists and turns in the story line and a very unpredictable ending."
3,The twists at the end were pretty good,"This was my first book by Erica Spindler. It was an ok book. The twists at the end were good, but I can't say I couldn't put it down. But, I will keep this author in mind next time I am book shopping."
3,Not her best - but an okay read,"I love most of Erica Spindler's novels but this one just didn't grab me as much of the others did. Still, a good read."
5,One Of My Faves!,I bought Cause For Alarm and I immediately became addicted to Erica Spindler's intense and glorifying writing. This book was really well thought out and kept making me turn pages. Mia is so intense! I was not expecting her to be so two-faced. Ashley's just hurt and crazy and Melanie just kicks ass! I definitely recommend this book to anyone who is ready to be an Erica addict!
5,You Must Read This Book,Erica Spindler has out done herself this time. This is one of the best romantic suspense novels I have ever read. It is intelligent and full of twists and turns. I couldn't put it down. Thanks Erica for such great entertainment!
4,Excellent reading,"I truly enjoyed this book, a lot of suspense, twists and turns to the story. The characters were well written."
1,Contrived and stereotypical,"The plot has too many coincidences. Who would believe that Conner's sister and Melanie's sister could be connected to the same psycho? Veronica's character is poorly developed -- either too good or too bad. Mia and Ashley are both mentally ill, but Melanie is perfectly sane. The ending was not a twist, but a poorly developed plot. I was angry with the ending, disbelieving that anyone would expect me to buy such drivel. This was my first Erica Spindler novel; it is probably my last."
2,Not her best,"This latest book by Spindler wasn't nearly as up to par as her other books. Fortune and Shocking Pink had better character developments and better plot twists. I don't think she tried as hard on this one. The two villians were not very believable. Spindler should have spent more time developing one of them in particular. The romance that occurs towards the end is too quick and boring. She didn't give us much reason to root for the couple. I was disappointed in this book. It wasn't terrible, but I know she can do a lot better."
2,Definitely not her best,"I have now read 4 of Erica Spindler's books and am looking forward to reading her others. Where Dead Run, Forbidden Fruit and Cause for Alarm were excellent, hard to put down books, All Fall Down was very hard to get into and stay interested in. If you are just discovering Erica Spindler's talent leave this one for last and read all of the others on her list. I would not recommend this book."
1,LOW ON PLOT...HIGH ON NUTCASES,"There was very little to like about this audio unless one is into insanity, mental illness, physical abuse, sexual abuse, incest, hate-crimes, and more time spent on same-sex relationships (though there's nothing wrong with that, just not my thing) than heterosexual ones. To top it off, the narrator (Brook Butterworth) was awful--she used squeaky little-girl voices, over-articulated her words, her tone kept rising and falling at weird times, she often sounded like she was on fast-forward, and she used an atrocious Southern accent. I thought this was going to be a mystery with a little romance yet it was far from it as it centered on the character's VAST emotional problems. Also, the main ""bad guy"" was obvious early on, but that may have been the narrator's fault."
1,A review of A Tribute to Alicia Keys,I should have known when I didn't see any mention of this compiliation on Alicia's website that this might be a waste of money and time. It would have been much better if it were strickly an intrumental approach to her songs. Instead it is various people attempting to sound like Alicia. I'm being very generous when I say attempting to sound like her. Don't waste your money on this one.
4,Descent 1 on Playstation 1,I remember playing this game as when I was around 8 and I thought it was awesome. This game is awesome but it can get a little boring. With just the playstation controller the game can be a little awkward. The levels become difficult to navigate even with the map. After getting the hang of it though the game is really fun with complex levels and tough enemies. There is not much to do after you beat the game but there are 30 levels and many of them are very large and take a long time to complete. It's not a small game. For under ten dollars it's definetely worth the money. If you manage to get two copies of this game and link consoles you can play two player against each other. A Really Good Game Overall
4,decsent,"Some time ago,when I adquired my playstation console my first game was Descent. Today, it is the only game that has me playing it over and over again. The fun of it being the incredible soundtrack, the smoothness of the gameplay in wich you can practically swim and the intricate maze of the mines in wich you must be absolutely aware of all your ship`s capabilities to survive. Armed with flares, lasers, missiles and your wits you must fight your way in and out of this maze with your ultimate prize: your comrade`s life and your own. I higly recomend it to all."
4,Great Game,"This game is an ultimate if you love this combination of mazes, shooting, and puzzles. Anyone would love to just jump right in and put their hands on the joystick, and blow those robots away. All in all this is the greatest game ever"
4,What I was looking for after I gave my son my Pampered Chef one.,"I like this pizza wheel for nonstick pans.It rolls smoothly and cuts well.The only reason that I didn't give it 5-stars is because it is quite heavy and would be uncomfortable if not impossible for someone with arthritis to use because of the weight. My Pampered Chef one was very light,but it is no longered carried by them. Cost was about the same."
1,Completely useless,"I'm astonished by the positive reviews for this pizza cutter. I've had it for a few months and have tried to cut pizza with it several times, and it has never successfully cut through a pizza crust. I always end up having to use a knife instead. I'm not convinced this thing could cut butter. It was a complete waste of money."
4,Good Addition to Kitchen Gadget Collection,"We'd always used a knife or a pair of scissors to cut up home-made pizza and decided to try this wheel after reading a favorable review for it.It does take a bit more pressure than I expected to cut the pizza, sometimes taking a few rolls over the spot we're cutting -- but we are also talking about whole wheat crusts here! My teens have no problem cutting the pizza with this wheel and always grab it before a knife now that it's part of our kitchen artillery.It's easy to wash and does the job without scratching our pans or slicing up our bread board by over zealous slicers using a sharp knife! If shopping for one again, I'd still chose this one."
5,Must have For the X-box owner,"This has to be one of the finest games greated for the X-box. The only draw-back is the camera angles get a little funky at times. Despite this I still give it five stars because the other elements, the fighting and acrobatics, more than make up for occasional faulty camera. Buy this game, you won't be dissappointed."
2,Paulie,This game is amazingly EASY. Save yourself the cash and rent it for a couple bucks if you really want to try it.
4,This game is not just good it's grrreat.. No really it rocks,"This game is awesome, me and my group play this game all the time (if we're not busy pickin' up girls at the mall) and we all give it 20 stars but the limit's 5 so ya'll know how it is. Anyway the graphics are spankin' and my girl loves the game and she comes over more often so you know that's a plus. The story's pretty good but I don't understand why the prince dude didn't just use the dagger to go back in time and not unleash the sands of time instead of goin' through all that trouble to fix everything. That ain't all I gotta say but me and the group gotta date with pizza and we all gotta buy Suffering at the mall so remember one thing about this game, if you want your girl to come over more often (if you have one, and if she likes video games) then buy this game!!!!!!!!!"
2,good graphics fighting system is obscene,"the graphics in this game are great but, the endless puzzles like getting to rooftops gets old i dont usually get mad over video games but i thought about taking it out if the xbox console and tearing it"
3,REALLY HARD...,"I LIKED IT, BUT THE GAME IS REALLY HARD...I LIKE A CHALLENGE, BUT SOME BOSS BATTLES, ETC, ARE JUST REDICULOUSLY DIFFICULT...I DUNNO, MAYBE I JUST SUCK AT VIDEOGAMES...ANYWAY, THERE'S ALSO NOT A WHOLE LOT OF XBOX LIVE CONTENT, EVEN THOUGH IT SAYS THERE IS XBOX LIVE COMPATIBILITY...ITS BASICALLY JUST ONLINE CHAT...BIG BOO THERE...THIS GAME DEFINITELY NEEDS SOME MULTIPLAYER...BUT THE GAMEPLAY IN SINGLE PLAYER, GRAPHICS, FUN FACTOR, ETC, MAKE UP FOR THAT...I'D BUY IT USED IF ANYTHING, OR MAYBE EVEN JUST RENT IT...JUST MY INPUT...-CHRIS-"
4,"Great game, but easy and hard!",The game has great graphics but could have been a little easier at some points and harder in other areas.
1,Item problems,"I'm not gonna say if this game was fun or not. I cant because when I ordered it I got a copy of Prince of Persia Warrior Within, a game I allready had. I ordered all three games at once and got the last two first. I played them and liked them (even though im still not able to get past Warrior Within) and couldnt wait to get the first. But when I got the package I just got a second copy of Warrior Within. I cant trade it in because nowhere takes old xbox games anymore. Im going to try again eventually but first I want to make sure I get the right game"
3,good overall,This game has a lot of really good concepts and is really fun for the first half hour. After that the fighting tends to get anoying and the puzzels are the same over and over.Rick112
4,Overall Great Game,"This game became one of my first addictions. I was hooked on this game, the voice acting..the excellent scenary..the storyline. Everything just fit together exactly how it should of. I was a little frustrated that the boss fight was pretty easy..The whole game makes up for that though, this is a must buy for any xbox owner"
5,One of the best games EVER,"As a kid, I played Prince of Persia and was glad to see the brand revived for modern day game machines. I found this game to be one of the best ever: the graphics were great (more ""matrix-like"" than Enter the Matrix!), and there was definitely action... but at the same time, there was a definite storyline, a lot of thought-invoking puzzles, and nothing was *too* hard (I dislike having to use a strategy guide in order to play a game). One nice thing about the action: even though there was a lot of swordplay, there was nothing really ""violent."" The T rating is appropriate."
1,Just to clear this up...,"First off, for the guy in France, this book is not censored or banned in America. It was out of print for some time, but was then reprinted, along with several other McCoy books, about four years ago.Second, I thought this book was embarrassing. ""They Shoot Horses, Don't They?"" was great, but this book is horribly clunky and obvious. Dolan, Bishop, and Myra do nothing but preach, and they do it badly. McCoy is better than this."
3,Good textbook on the subject,"This book gives a solid, easy to read introduction to CMP and all the different factors associated with it. The text is accessible to any undergraduate in engineering, yet contains a lot of information that makes it handy as a reference."
5,Excellent overall XSI training,"This book was an absolute surprise. As a new XSI 4.0 user, I had been disappointed with other books. The author focuses on character animation, but in discussing this objective, he takes the reader through an overview of XSI, its features, distinctive elements, and tools ""how to."" For example, he discusses sub-division, NURBS, and polygon modeling, explaining the differences, benefits, and disadvantages.I would strongly recommend a visit to the Mesmer.com website (publisher), for additional details on this and other training materials."
5,cool!,"I got a tomagotchi and on the first day my kitten knocked it off the table n it broke, but it was ok because i had 2.There awesome! All the girls in my 6th grade class have them.Now, if you'll exuse me, I've got 2 go find mine."
3,"Love Anne Rice, but....",I really didn't like the Mayfair Witches as much as the Vampire chronicles. I preferred those over these. It's not a bad read it's just I could get into the Mayfair Witches like I could the Vampire Chronicles.
4,"Great Game, Showing It's Age (PS1)","I purchased this game to play on my PS3 & I was fairly happy with it. That is till it was released on the XB live arcade in HD with 3d backgrounds as ""R-type Dimensions"". If I would have knew it was coming to XBLA I would have waited. Great for PS2 & PS3 owners."
3,Bare bones presentation holds it back,"The R-Type games are truly classics. Unfortunately, this collection of the two original arcade hits has not aged well, especially considering that if this pack had been released recently, it likely would've been filled with interesting extras.This is worth owning if you are a fan and/or collector of classic games. Otherwise, you might want to break in to the R-Type series with R-Type Delta or R-Type Final."
4,"A toy for your older, cynical, child...","Got this for a Christmas present for my daughter, who is in her early 20's and into stuff like this. Wanted to give her a ""toy"" and these were perfect. May have to buy another set. She loves Tim Burton."
3,installation,This is a great looking product once its installed.The installation is very difficult. The directions are confusing and it will take you more than one attempt to get it in place. When its done you'll be pleased on how it enhances the look of your Harley.
1,Amazon doesn't Email the order,amazon doesn't email the order so unless you call the magic geek juggling store you will not recieve your order I started out with an order of 5 dube euros but i ended up with these because There was a backup on the dubeThere great clubs anyway I've been working alittle bit with 5 there great for 5 And they have a nice soft feel in your hands
3,70-290 review,I took the test and failed it. I don't feel that this book went into enough depth on several issues. I have since purchased materials put out by Microsoft and hope to have better luck.
5,"takes time to get up and running, but then good times","after you install everything the PCI card and various software/firmware/drivers it works well, but to get the 3Gb/s, superfast speeds, you need to stripe the RAID yourself, NOT using the LaCie express stripe software. There are no directions for this - I had to contact LaCie directly. Once the LaCie drive is formatted as JBOD, you can use (on Mac OS) Disk Utility to build a Striped RAID (don't do a concatenated format), which is super quick and easy (because you're on a Mac). Once you've finished that, the drive PUMPS.So after some complicated, not very well documented set up and configuration procedures, you get a really fast, large drive for what is really a quite reasonable price."
5,Better than the first volume!,"The series begins to hit its stride in episodes three and four. In these episodes we learn more about the reluctant young hero shinji, and his supervisor/roomate Misato. The excitement never lets up at NERV, and Shinji makes new friends at school. Though Shinji struggles with his fears and self-doubts, we begin to get a more in-depth view of him as 3 dimensional character."
5,This move is awsome!,"This movie is awsome! All evangelion is awsome! It has to be the best anime series ever! I recomened these in subtitles. The dub voice are enough to make a person go loony for a month, but the japanese voices are beautiful! Don't ever get anime dubbed. I fully recomend this movie to anyone, but not to small children."
2,A distinctly un-thrilling thriller,"376 pages of convolution, an endless parade of characters, plot twists galore - and not very satisfying.An obnoxious young American woman comes to London to peddle the alleged memoirs of a former British spy. The publisher she is to meet with is murdered by a pair of nasties. Soon enough we are involved with the inner workings of several British police and intelligence agencies, a bunch of terrorists, a turncoat Brit nursing a grudge and the CIA. There is the grizzled old pro, Peter Ashton; the beleaguered director; the wannabes and perky analyst working her way up the ladder.Not an awful read, but definitely pedestrian. The characters despite the earnest efforts of the author never take on any depth. The plot twists and turns, but not in a way that excites. No sitting on the edge of your seat here. The final scenes are hideously contrived and unbelievable.In all, an un-thrilling thriller.Jerry"
2,Not flourescent green,These tees are OK but they are not flourescent green as the picture shows. They are dark green. I bought them becuase the flourescent color is easy to see; dark green is not and am therefore disappointed with this product. Would not purchase again.
5,"it's some fine nils, but.....","The Back It Up omission shocked me. It is indeed his signature song. The best Nils, though is the live Night After Night double LP. Not even sure that ever came out on CD (and too lazy to check in mid typeism). I'm from the Maryland suburbs of DC so Nils is a local hero (whom sadly I have never seen live, I don't get out that much). I'm sure to most he's the guitarist for the Boss who wasn't in the Sopranos or the Underground garage. Grfin and Nils' solo work are top notch rock, and it's too bad he's a niche artist/sideman. And since my first name is Keith, I've always thought, I'd never take your fun away guy, who gave me way too much. Though I've never been a Pirate's dad or hung out with Amita Pallenberg, so I know I ain't really that guy. Nils is truly a master guitarist and created some great stright ahead rock songs. Buy this, download, borrow a copy from somebody. Just get it . Soon. Today. Now."
1,The worst every,College proffesors do not know english literature. I did the book in college for english 102. It was boring then and it is still boring now.
1,Stay Away,"This was the most boring game I've ever bought. Don't let the description of multiple games with multiple characters fool you. It's one game that you go through with various times with different characters. The valiant effort of a very non-linear storyline was marred by the fact that it was so non-linear that the stories were often left being incoherent. It's tedious going through the same mini-quests over and over. Most of the characters could have been a good choice to have their own full game.This was a good idea, playing through multiple games where you meet up with past characters that you played, but the games needs a huge overhaul in order to give it more variety.If you have a LOT of time to kill and are very easily amused and find this game for very cheap, give it a whirl. Otherwise, find a decent game or play Final Fantasy VII for the 10th time. It will be much more interesting."
2,"If you want a *good* RPG, skip this one.","Saga Frontier is one of the worst efforts by Squaresoft. It boasts over 100 hours of play, but 90% of that time is spent wandering around the world thinking ""What the heck am I supposed to do next! """
1,This game bites!,"For starters, I only gave is a star because there was no option to give it 0. I have never been so dissapionted in a game. Not only was the gameplay bad, but the quests were the most random, illogical, and boring pains that I sold the game to babbages for less than half the price I paid and was thankful they gave me as much as they did. If you like good RPG's, DO NOT get this game. I'm only trying to save you from losing faith in Square (who usually produces the best games I've ever seen)."
2,It Sucked,"I bought this game when it first came out. I am a really big fan of the Final series, but I put in the game and played blue. I had no idea what to do I played for a few hours and really had no sence of plot. I still havent beat the game because there ar so many better games such as Luner now thats a great game I played it for Saga CD when it came out I was a freshmen in High School. I am now a JR. in college and I went out and bought it when relesed for Playstation. Dont waste your money. The only reason I didnt give it a one is the concept is orginal."
1,hmmm....,"After playing Saga Frontier, I'm one of those people wondering why I had to give it a star at all. I spent days playing, but I never found the point and I tired of running around in circles. However, everyone's reviews are either one star or five and it's making wonder if I might have missed something; I'm an openminded person so I'm going to play again, and try to determine whether or not those giving it five stars are out of their ... minds. This review is probably no help at all, although it has to be easier to understand than the game itself."
4,unique game,"this is a unique rpg in its own way. i can see why not many people played this game due to some unfinished plot and hard interpretations of some character endings. but if u are a hardcore rpg player, its not a bad game, at least back then. unique characters and storyline even though Fuse was the character that was supposed to be in the finished version"
5,Three words...better than FFVII,"This game is such a masterpiece. It has wonderfully brilliant music, an even better battle system, and characters that are just having some little problems for you to fix. The storyline is what you make it. If it is to be involved, then go do a lot of extra things to make the story longer. If it is to be bare minimum, then blow right through the game. Needless to say, the base story isn't the most involved I've ever seen, but everything else about the game is beyond any Squaresoft RPG on PS (except FFTactics of course; FFVII and FFIX are so newbie and bandwagoner based that they ...more than anything that has ever ... before; FFVIII was ok...) Anyway, I've played through this game on several occasions, and I just love it. I'm the only person I know to have played this game longer than 1 or 2 characters, let alone beat it. Everyone that doesn't play this game is missing out."
3,To Mediocre and Beyond,"I cannot help but have mixed feelings about this game. It can get quite easy for new players to be confused by both the plotline(s), as well as what to do next. Still the innovative material for each story and background are quite interesting. As far as JRPG's go, one could take it or leave it."
4,Definately more entertaining than any Final Fantasy,"Sure it might not be for everyone, but the game play is very fluid. There are no stupid random encounters. I played through as Blue and got sucked into the game like no other game has done since. I don't condsider the game to be playable with all 7 characters though. The missions are all basically the same regardless of who you play as and it will get monotonous quick."
2,A good idea....but that's it.,"Saga Frontier was a good idea for a non-linear RPG, but that is about it. The game seemed to be lost in it self. Trying to be so many different things at once, but failing to be good at any of them. All, of the storys are pretty boring. The battle system is nothing you haven't seen before. All in all not a very good game."
1,Don't bother,"Normally I love RPGs, and Square is one of the best developers, but this game was horrible. You can take seven different characters through the game, but after I finished with just one character I said forget it. It takes too long to get from point A to B and half the time you can't even figure out where point B is or what you should do there. Just goes to show that you should always rent before buying."
4,Smart and frugal tips,"This book has been very useful in figuring out ways to mitigate the expense of planning a wedding quickly (I'm @ 5 months and counting!!) Without as much time to shop around, you need to get creative and this book does help. Some of the ideas are obvious, but there are enough you won't have thought of to make the purchase worth it. Written in a friendly, enjoyable style to make it a fun read."
3,Very Disappointed,"I was disappointed with this book. I was looking for something that would make me feel less stressed out about the short time to plan a wedding, but instead it increased it. The book starts off by telling you that because of your short time you will need to do six months of work in the first month. The book is useful as a wedding planning guide, but it says a lot of the same things that other wedding planning books say. I wouldn't read this book as a real help for planning a wedding quickly though."
3,"OK, but not as helpful as I would have liked","To be fair, I did buy this book used so some of the information was outdated. There were a few items that were helpful and gave me good ideas but overall I thought that it should have been more useful to a person planning a wedding in 6 months or less. Most of the information just seemed to be practial information used as filler. And almost all of it was the same as the other guides I bought which were written for people with ages to plan their weddings."
5,'You wouldn't like me when I'm angry!',"I've been watching this show on the RTN network, but had never seen how the show started until I ordered this video. It's all here - David Banner's wife, who dies tragically in an auto accident: how Banner discovered the hidden strength he was looking for - and how that strength turned him into a monster; and the persistent, and annoying Jack McGee from the National Register. It could've easily been a spoof, a joke, but what makes it work is Bill Bixby's sensitive portrayal of David Banner - a kind, gentle, but ultimately tortured man."
5,A graphic novel for mature readers,"Demonstrating a great knowledge of the folklore and mythology of the British Isles, ""The Black Dragon"" weaves a story of intrigue around the time that Christianity began displacing the original religions of the Isles. The story is mature, but frankly presented, which may make it unsuitable for young readers. While the story does not contain gratuitous violence or sexuality, it does deal with these issues as real occurences of life. Those easily offended by frank displaying of this subject matter may want to investigate further before buying. However, the story and the artwork make this an enjoyable graphic novel for those mature enough to handle such sensitive materials."
2,Awsome art! But I just couldn't get into the story.,"I knew after the first 10 pages of this graphic novel that the story was not going to interest me one bit. I forced myself to read four or five more pages, and then I had to give it up.I AM NOT SAYING THE STORY WAS BAD. It's just that for some reason I couldn't get interested in it and therefore couldn't read it all the way through. I can't help but get the feeling that if this story was presented in a text only fantasy novel that I might have gotten more out of it.Strange indeed. Most of the time I enjoy sword and sorcery graphic novels.On a more positive note I must praise the black and white artwork of John Bolton. The art was simply fantastic!"
5,Different than I thought,"I have always been amazed at the sound of someone who can sweep as I am sure you have if you are reading this.I found this DVD surprisingly helpful. I have always watch all those clips of instructional video's across the internet. So I was skeptical of getting this DVD. I found it to cover information that no one seems to have ever mentioned.There are good exercises to start small and piece sweeps together into the big 6, 7 or more string sweeps. But what I found the most helpful was learning how to control the pick over different strength/thickness almost instantly adjusting which is what he points out at the very beginning.Worth while getting if you are having trouble getting started. If you can already do 3 string sweeps with no problem save yourself the couple bucks and practice them on different sets of all 3.THIS IS NOT A COVER ALL SWEEP SHAPES VIDEO"
5,Great DVD,"Stuart Bull is an amazing musician and great guitar instructor.He explains everything in detail and shows all the lessons at a good moderate pace.I'm not amazing like he is, I'm more close to the advance stages of guitar but ever since I bought this DVD, I've improved alot and I can actually sweep, not crazy mozart fast but at a good moderate-speeded pace cleanly and smoothly because of Stuart Bull.I recommend this DVD to everyone and it's for all levels."
5,"Horses, Cattle & Coyotes","This is one of the Sons' finest efforts, differing from their earliest CDs in that most of the compositions on this one are originals. These fellows have a unique sound. They received praise from Roy Rogers who was pleased that they were continuing the tradition of fine Western harmony and solos, begun by his Sons of the Pioneers many years earlier. The San Joaquin boys grew up on the music of the Pioneers, but have now added their own wonderful (award-winning) compositions to the library of great Western music. A prime example is ""He's Running Out of Round-ups"" on this CD. But I was also glad to see them include Michael Martin Murphey's ""Land of Enchantment"", too (listen to the sample!). This CD's a winner!"
5,A must for all M7 owners.,"This is a wonderful book written by a true Leica expert. Eastland takes us through the M7 from its basic operation to advanced techniques. Previous Leica users will enjoy Eastland's references to earlier cameras, but such references are not so prevalent that they will annoy readers for whom the M7 is their first Leica. It's more than an expanded user's manual, it gets you excited about photography in general and the M7 in particular. If you own an M7, you should have this book."
1,"""You Ain't no Punk you punk"" Cramps Quote","Man did this suck IMHO. Coming from someone who grew up in the shadows of punk I couldn't believe this guy spoke of diving into punk the way he did. He was too young to dive into the middle of things so in that department he is considered a poser. In scholarly works this is nothing and really is a weak perhaps type of Buddhism for dummies type of thing. Man kids were not pissed off because their parents mediated they had real issues to deal with. To borrow from a Dead Kennedy's song; ""What you really need is a Holiday Inn Cambodia"" But not the travel you describe you need only a bowl of rice per day.Grasshopper grap these stones"
2,"the cover was the best part, unfortunately","i'm sorry, i just can't recommend this book. it is the story of an addict's recovery, and he happens to dabble in buddhism, as well as hinduism. it is a bit pretentious, the few quick plugs for his dad's books seem a bit cheap and although it wasn't poorly written, it wasn't that interesting. his travels to thailand, burma and india could have been redeeming but he missed those chances as well. he does not seem like a real buddhist at all, just a recovering addict who happens to use bits of buddhism and his father's connections to help get along. yes it is a success story and a great example for addicts, but the book as a whole, just isn't worth it."
5,The Surprise of Honesty,"I was surprised and gratified with Mr. Levine's honesty. The gut wrenching revealation of everything he did: thievery, betrayal, addiction, sleeping in his own vomit, and finally facing himself to find his own path leaps off of the page because it is the author's truth.I had to wait for the book. As soon as it arrived I started reading, I couldn't put it down. I began reading at about four in the afternoon and read the book cover to cover until I had read it all -- when I looked up at the time it was after midnight.I'd recommend this book to anyone. Whether or not you have found your own path you'll respect the author for his truthfulness and courage."
4,Dharma Punx? It Rox.,"I attended local reading and tho no Punk was immediate convert. Inspring to see one of our generation show the way. It's hard to believe Noah has come through so much, so thoroughly--he comes off as softest, warmest person you can imagine... he's been through--and come out of--well DHARMA PUNX is a testament to the power of meditation to present the possibility of true freedom to anyone, at anytime. The only way this book could be better is if it were bigger. Harry Potter gets 870 pages? Bring it on, Noah!"
2,Read Hardcore Zen instead.,"A couple of people have mentioned ""Hardcore Zen"" and compared it to D.P. It really is way better. It is much more funny and much less pretentious. I don't doubt that D.P. is helping some people but I also have to think that just about anybody would be glad that they read Hardcore Zen."
1,Bad Writing and Spiritual Narcissism,"Wanted to Love it. Read 40 pages and put it back on the shelf...I was smelling far too much spiritual materialism. Noah may have an interesting story, but he seems way too impressed with it himself. I found myself thinking...""Who Cares?"". Hope this book offers something good to others, but it certainly didn't for me.P.S. Cool cover, though."
2,disappointed,"As a person on a spiritual path after my own stuggles with drugs and alcohol, I was looking forward to reading this book and getting inspired. I was quite disappointed. Noah's book of elementary-style writing and run on sentences can best be summed up as ""Noah is a punk rocker and he meditates and he thinks he's really cool"". Every other paragraph is littered with ""I am a punk rocker"" statements. It gets really tedious, especially after the first chapter. The book is clearly meant for his fellow punk-rockers--and it's wonderful if troubled teens really connect to what he's saying. However, for someone on a spiritual path, Noah is certainly attached to his ego. Noah brags a lot, puts in some plugs for his father's books, and makes you realize that with connections, anyone can get published. On the plus side, this book has inspired me to write my own memoirs..."
1,"He hated his folks, and now he doesn't","I bought Hardcore Zen and loved it, so I spent the extra money on this and found it not exciting at all. A lot of teenage angst that unfortunatly does not do it for me any more. I didn't learn anything about Buddhism, and his tales of Punk days long ago, were pretty dull.Good front cover, go buy Hardcore Zen."
2,ignores the positive side of punk,"It's great that a privileged white kid from so-cal can get into drugs then turn his life around using his dad's connections, wow glad he had to work so hard, right.... But what really ""upsets"" me about Noah here is that he ignores the myriad of positive aspects of punk rock the 100's of bands and 1000s of kids who did NOT see punk rock as a dead end street, or as a reason for violence. Haven been in punk bands for most of my adolescent through adult life I find this very offensive, I too am a Buddhist, and the two paths are neither mutually exclusive or really all that different. Some friends of mine on tour in another positive punk band stayed at my flat on tour a couple weeks ago and we had a good laugh at this. But I guess you gotta do something to sell books."
2,"It is an ""Ok"" read...","The book is great in showing the details of Levine's struggle with addiction and his path to recovery. However, it lacks the artistic touch and with its extensive chronological display it reads more like a biography than a memoir . Some parts of the book were exciting and many were too long and boring, especially the details of his trips and the monasteries that he visited. He doesn't go deep into intellectual discussions or explains his ideologies. Rather, he just refers to them as part of conversations that he had with his friends ""We discussed the nature of being,"" for example. The book has no dialogue at all and the writer tends to repeat himself a lot. I wonder how many times he said ""Spiritual Practice"" or ""Full cycle of friendship""!"
5,A history of research,I read this book in preparation for interviewing Ms. Smith on Talkcity.com about this book. I found the book to be an excellent discription of the research process that has gone on in the past twenty years. She also updates the jargon of the profession. Remote perceptions is a nice term to describe the variety of experiences that extend our consciousness beyond our normal locale. I found her explantions to be accurate. The follow-up interveiw also revealed she is authentic.
3,Overall not too bad a book.,"If you really want to feel something stronger on this subject then read, ""Apocalypse Angel,"" by Charles Rivers."
1,DON'T PAY THIS PRICE!!!,"I'm an idiot. I thought this came with two in one. These are 6 bucks or so in a normal grocery store.Please just go your local store and buy this and don't follow me down the idiot path to paying twice as much for something you want!!!So, yes, I am getting the one star for this order along with any company who sells it for this price.Don't hate the wheat germ...."
1,THREE TIMES THE PRICE OF WALMART,GOOD PRODUCT BUT THIS COMPANY IS RIPPING OFF CUSTOMERS. GO TO YOUR LOCAL WALMART OR PUBLIX AND GET IT FOR LESS THAN HALF THIS OUTRAGEOUS PRICE.
2,Bad video quality,"The copy of the video seems bootleg. It does not cover the entire screen and is very pixelated. Fantastic Spanish film, but the quality of the DVD is very low."
4,"Spotless leather, every time!","Junk Reviewer, once again.Did your kids track mud in the car? Did the dog have an accident? Did YOU have an accident? Destroy whatever stain you can imagine with Lexol-pH Leather Cleaner. Dirt, mold, cheese, even goat blood! Worth every penny."
4,"It may not be correct, but...","After reading the book and the previous posters, even if the Japanese mathematics classes were not representative of the education system as a whole, the implications of this study and the ideas that the authors came up with are what we should be focusing on.The question ""why?"" is asked far too little in all mathematics classes. If only we would take some time to teach the methods and reasons of mathematics, rather than just the process, I am sure that all students will benefit and be able to truly understand the concepts that are currently being taught with a ""learn it for the test"" attitude.The book brings up these vital points, so that teachers may question their styles, regardless of the authenticity of some of their claims."
1,Not a political contest,"This book is rich with Paul's memories of his own life's work with several organizations and corporations. It seemed he was destined and called to work for Habitat and that is the main emphasis of the book. The description of the morning when the music of a thousand hammers is heard is particularly poignant. Hopefully, this book will be evaluated with open minds and open hearts. I enjoyed it all the way through.I found Paul Leonard's book insightful and even handed. The reviews I have read here are like some personality contest for Millard and Linda Fuller, ie American Idol? I am sure they are above this sort of cult worship. What they have done and are doing is their legacy."
1,Irishness,"I am reading this book so I am aware these are first impressions. So far, it is pretty offensive. Apparently the proud heritage I inherited from my parents, grandparents and so on is so much fluff and nonsense. So no one of Euro- American heritage has an authentic claim to ethnic identity? What is the purpose of this book? I may amend this later and I certainly intend to read it closely but so far, it is so much hyperbole."
5,Excellent transaction,This product arrived exactly as expected - on time and in great condition. I recommend this vendor highly. Amazon is the only way to go to get good books at competetive prices.
1,Disappointed,"I ordered a used ""in good condition"" leather bound edition of the Presbyterian Hymnal at a cost of $31.90 from Your On Line Bookstore what I received was a standard hard cover hymnal which retails new for about $14.00. Very disappointing."
3,Fun but the puzzles are a little obscure...,"I am enjoying this game but it is primitive compared to ""Soul Reaver: Legacy of Kain"" which I played first. ""Soul Reaver"" is the sequel to this game and its graphics and scenery are SO far advanced compared to this that it is unbelievable!I like the freedom this game gives you to explore the world of Nosgoth but I am frustrated occasionally by how obscure some of the solutions are to the puzzles- ther eare still doors I can't open because I haven't figured out the trick.The shapechanging and spell abilities are cool though!"
5,Good game but false advertising from vendor,"The game itself is a classic. Top down rpg with vampiric elements! However, I had the impression that I would be receiving a black label from the vendor. Instead, I get a game that was originally part of a compilation of eidos greatest hits. I'm disappointed the vendor did not mention, but nevertheless the disc was in pristine condition."
5,Not bad for a 2D game...,"I'll be honest..i dont like 2D games. The only 2D games i liked and given credit for were the old Final Fantasy Games and Super Mario Brothers. Well I better add Blood Omen to that list. This is the most addicting 2D game ever. I spent hours playing it. The gamplay is simple but interesting, the story is dark and very well told. A story worthy of shakespear. The voice acting is also excellent, half the reason why i like the legacy of Kain games. Simon Templemen is by far the greatest voice actor ever. He makes Kain a character to likeIn sort words: BUY THIS GAME!!!"
4,Classica hack and slash,"Blood Omen is the game that started the all. The Legacy of Kain series has now spawned four following games, the last one 'Defiance' on the Xbox.Blood Omen is a classic overhead view hack n' slash with some excellent, and for the time, innovative features such as morphing into bat and wolf form which allows the player to access different areas of Nosgoth.The storyline is deep and racked with intrigued and deceit.What really shines in this game is the voice acting. Seldom have I witnessed a game where the voice actors do such a phenomenal job.For younger players which are used now to the glitz of HD games and incredible physics this game might be a bit dated.For those of us that started gaming in the late 80's and early 90's this will be greatly appreciated."
4,The Greatest Vampire,"One the best and finest quiet classics available for the PlayStation. The story, FMV, story, and voices were the greatest features, as well as shape-morphing. If there is anything that I can say about this huge and impressive blood-sucking adventure, it is this: Kain is the most powerful, realistic and exciting vampire ever; the ultimate vampire since Dracula."
4,Beautiful,Kundera is definitely one of those authors you have to be in the mood for. Not exactly beach reading. I found this title to be his best and the easiest one to get into. Once you get in the rhythm of things it is absolutely beautiful
2,too clever by half,"If you like post-modernist deconstructionism then this is the novel for you! After reading each page you will be able to sigh and say This author is so clever! And I the reader must be pretty clever too to be enjoying such a clever author. So we all win! Myself, I thought that Calvino's If on a stormy night was better, as these post-modern deconstructionist novels go - it really turned everything upside down and inside out. I found this novel pretentious contrived and ultimately boring. The author spends a lot of the time discussing what the characters are thinking and a lot of the time philosophizing. Too much head stuff altogether. It is clear that many readers are enraptured by this novel, but definitely not all of us. An acquired taste!"
2,breathtaking start....bogged down to rubbish,"I was enchanted by the beginning. Unfortunately, the author seems to have spent his entire inspiration in the openning and to have simply been filling up space with alternating sordid and trite story lines as devices to sustain interest. I was terribly disappointed as every aspect of the novel declined; as I read, I kept hoping that it would improve. I finally skimmed the last third and was relieved to close it. Too bad as the beginning was brillant...."
5,lose your self....and be satiated.,"my copy of this is full of highlight marks....so many epiphany filled quotes that shed light on one's being (human) that even though i am a biased kundera fan, i believe anyone who is not daunted by non-formulaic approaches to novel writing will find this a transcendental bible of epihany and story-relating.(i liken it to Krzysztof Kieslowski and Wim Wenders sort of imagery & character-storytelling)"
2,Pretentious,"After hearing the rave reviews about this book, perhaps I set my expectations too high. I found nothing original nor outstanding in this book. The author is opinionated, condescending and self indulgent, churning tired, pretentious and contrived conclusions about the human character. Immortality is, at best, a tiring read, with little substance and even less originality of thought."
4,MAJOR GOOF!,"I concur with most of the reviews that combining these two classic musicals is a great idea. But how can you issue a soundtrack without the main song written by Rodgers & Hammerstein for any *STATE FAIR* -- ""It's a Grand Night for Singing""? This is in reference to the 1962 movie soundtrack. On my original soundtrack album, this number was sung by Pat Boone, Bobby Darin, Anita Gordon and Chorus. It is not on this ""remastered"" CD. How could anyone purposely delete it? Is it because it was included in the 1945 soundtrack and someone did not want to repeat it twice? The ""BONUS"" vocal/rehearsal tracks of this song certainly do not make up for this major goof. I feel cheated and truly wanted to get rid of my 1962 vinyl but now find I can't. All because someone saw fit to delete the one song that epitomizes this show!"
3,"40's Version Wonderful, but 60's Nothing to Write Home About","I thoroughly enjoyed the 1945 version of the music, but the cd lost it's luster once the 60's version came on. I guess you could consider me a traditionalist, so maybe that is why I like the orignal, but just from the music, I will not watch the 60's version."
3,FAULTY REMASTERING!,"In all the years since this CD was released, it's hard to believe no one has ever taken note on here for the faulty remastering of the 1962 tracks. Has no one but myself noticed that the mixing is out of sync between vocals and orchestra on two of the tracks? Both MORE THAN JUST A FRIEND and the FINALE are completely out of sync. On the Ewell solo, the calliope scoring is between four to eight bars ahead of Ewell and the orchestra. On the finale, the chorus and orchestra are four bars apart. It's staggering that no one in the production team noticed this. For those of us who love the 1962 version, it's a real loss - in addition to all the missing tracks already mentioned on here."
1,NOT the original,"I purchased and returned this CD. The songs have no integrity and have all been redone, so they don't have the great sound of the originals. Very disappointing if you want to hear the original recordings. Look at the fine print on the cover, and it reads 'formerly of' the Three Degrees - that should give it away."
3,Not the original recordings BUT !,"It is time for this group to move their sound into the new millennium. Therefor this cd with the vocals from Helen, Valerie & Cynthia (replaced Sheila) who is now about 10 years in the group. Indeed time to record their greatest hits again. The Three Degrees proved with a 35 years career to be 'mega' stars. Go on girls, we all love you very much !"
1,"Test Drive Le Mans, The Worst","Test Drive Le Mans for PS2 is probably the worst racing sim I've come across. The graphic are really really cheesy and the controller interface doesn't respond to any of the racing wheels I tried with it. When I went to the ATARI website to get help it was, no surprise, not listed. I also tried the PC version which would not even boot up or would lock up my computer using Windows XP or Vista. The only reason I gave this a one star is because the rating system would not allow me to give it a zero. Stay away from this game."
4,Think of it as multi purpose!,"This is a cute sleeping bag. It makes my littlest one feel like she is part of the crowd when her older sisters have sleepovers! Obviously, it is not meant for everyday sleeping habits, and in our house it is used primarily as an activity mat."
5,"One of a kind, underappreciated game that sucks you into its world.","I've been gaming for over a decade, and I'd have to say that Beyond Good and Evil is possibly the most under-appreciated, critically-acclaimed game. BG&E is a seamless and natural blend of multiple gameplay styles: stealth, action, racing and puzzles. The game's art and direction is unique and makes you immersed into its world. The voice acting is superb for a video game, and the story is engrossing. In short, BG&E is not just a great game, but an under-appreciated work of art."
4,This one had slipped under my radar,"I missed this game when it first came out, and now it can only be found with re-sellers. It's a real shame there's no way to make sure the folks who made this game got a peice of what I payed for it. This game has some very original art work and characters. Controls feel right, and the game is well put together. A good time for anyone who plays it. Though not an all time classic like 'Zelda' or 'Ratchet & Clank', it does soundly belong in the next greatest level under them. If you can find a copy of this one, it's well worth the $20-$30 it's likely to cost you."
4,Addictive,"When I first started the game, I thought it was strange and wasn't sure if I could continue with it - like why does she look like Pat Benotar and why does the pig speak with a fake southern accent. But after completing the first assigned mission of Black Isle, I was hooked. Stealth, mystery, conspiracy, and wondrous graphics kept me playing until I finished. I also appreciated having no ""cheap deaths"". At times I felt it babied me, but otherwise the game just seemed to want to engage me. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys games such as ""Prince Of Persia"" or ""Tomb Raider""."
5,Very addicting!,"This game is a lot better than what I expected. I hadn't even heard of it, but it seemed cool. I couldn't put this game down! It has a lot of fighting, and puzzle solving. It's not too hard, and it's not too easy, its perfect. You take pictures also, to get pearls, and use pearls to buy parts for your boat. You also can buy these really cool gadgets. You also have to go on a top secret mission and sneak past guards! It's very exciting, and never gets dull. You also fight with a pig. And you get to buy these awesome devices for different uses. I'd suggest that you buy this game!"
5,A True Gem,"Anyone that has played this game knows that it is one of the greatest games ever made. Too bad it never caught on mainstream. I kind of like it that way though. Almost assuredly there will be a sequel. Play the game and you'll see what I mean. Finally, there will be no game description from me, this game needs no introduction. Buy it, you'll like it, and for the price, you would be a fool not too."
4,"Not just another fighting/shooter, thank goodness","Good story.Fun gameplay.Not a ""kill everything in sight"" game. Which to me is refreshing. There are a few layers to each mission. One is to advance the overall storyline, the other is to take pictures of animals/creatures to earn money. The third is to unearth pearls to beef up your vehicles.The stealth aspects are what drew me to this one. While with guile you can defeat difficult opponents, you can also avoid the confrontation altogether by sticking to the shadows and sneaking past them. There are many save-game spots in each level and if you should be ""killed"" you just start over from a step or two before the fight that did you in.That said, my beef is that the big final confrontation is a battle royale and not in step with the rest of the gameplay."
5,best game I have ever seen or heard of.!,"I have about 15teen games and this is the best.!;-) The story is wonderful and the characters are great it is fun silly and worth your time this is the best game I have and when it was over I said to myself "". that was fun so ware is beyond good and evil 2 ."" this game is the best I'd buy it at any price they ask for. and the next best thing is playing it again and again. until you are sick of the TV screen which with me is very hard.buy at any price you can high or low. :)"
2,"The most overrated ""underrated"" game I've ever played.","It's kind of funny how many will point to this game and say what a shame it is that it didn't succeed, blah blah blah. There's a clear and easy reason why this was the case:the game is nothing special.It's similar to other platforming/adventure games but inferior to them in just about every way. The combat is subpar, the story is subpar, the stealth sections and vehicle sections are annoying... it just doesn't do a whole lot particularly well. It's not a terrible game, mind you: it's just a generic one. And it was ignored for a reason."
2,Some good advice but overall of limited usefulness,"I bought this because used it cost 1 cent plus shipping! There is some useful advice about the race, but some of the training advice is not up to date. For example, he talks about the importance of drinking water, with no mention of the risks of hypnotremia. You will notice that the last review was over 3 years ago. A lot has been learned in that time...That said, I picked up some useful tips for my upcoming NY Marathon. It's a very fast read, and I would recommend reading it for someone running the race for the first time; but I would see if it's available at the library, since it isn't a book one needs to own, IMHO."
2,Fixing the audio static,"Someone was kind enough to add a note under a similar product (the XBV443) that if you use the remote control (instead of the front panel) to do the on/off and play, the audio static disappears. This turned out to be completely correct, and fixed the loud static I was getting on the left channel.That said, while this is a ""satisfactory"" solution, having this problem at all on a new player seems rather ridiculous. Anyway, I mainly wanted to post about the fix, since I'm sure any of you with audio problems are as frustrated as I was. (And we're not talking subtle here... it's as loud as the signal.)"
2,Bad luck with reliability,The VCR on mine broke after I used it once (it now chews up tapes). I was past the meager warranty period and it would cost almost more than I paid for the thing to have it repaired. So I'm not a fan.
2,its good except for one thing,this is really a good DVD/VCR player combo but the thing is. it made my dvd skipped. but that was only one DVD/VCR the other ones my relatives had doesnt make them skip? so i dont know
2,DVD crashed!,"Bought this to save space, it ended up taking up space in the garage and being useless after less than a year. The DVD made horrible noises and sometime the sound wouldn't work at all, the VCR never had a problem. It was a total waste of money. Ended buying a cheaper less know brand that is still going without any difficulties."
2,Limited life span,"Bought this a year ago, Barely used it. And then it just stopped working...try something else!"
2,DVD is good but not VCR,"I bought this unit last Christmas (2004). So far I don't have any problem with the DVD, but the VCR is horrible. It doesn't function well with the recording and definitely play lousy VHS. I am thinking to get a new combo this Christmas."
1,This product is nothing but problems....,Not only have I had to return the first unit I got; but now the second unit is having problems. I hit Progressive Scan by mistake and I have no idea how to turn it off.DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK!
5,Dependable for the job.,"I use a model like this for home electronics building, troubleshooting, and repair all of the time. Its got a durable hard plastic case so if you drop it you won't be buying a new one. The back light for illumination effect is great and the readout is clear. There is also a great how to manual for beginners if you are not familiar on how to use one, complete with testing point to point scenarios included. Bottom line is bottom line, as you can't beat the price. I think it is the best Multimeter out there for the money. Highly Recommended!"
5,Mr. Theory,"I purchased this meter based purely on price expecting a flimsy feeling but functional meter that I wouldn't mind if it got damaged or fell. Instead, this meter has a nice quality feel, good balance, and enough weight to stay put.The rubber protective casing adds to the quality feel and the test leads are nice also. The function switch is solid and clearly labeled. With the back lit display there is a lot of value for the price. I can't see how one could go wrong with this choice."
4,Weedend warrior mechanic,"For the price point that this meter is at, I don't see how you can beat it. I could easly buy five of these for the same price as one of the more expensive brands and not worry about it."
5,Multimeter,"This is an EXCELLENT Multimeter for the price! The display updates about as fast as any other multimeter and has all the usual goodies: resistance, voltage(up to 600v), Current(up to 10A), a diode checker etc. It also has a continuity check that will beep when to probes complete a circuit with each other, so its good for checking and quickly diagnosing broken circuits. One thing that really stands out about this meter is that it has a back light. Even though you won't find needing it very often, I usually turn it on anyway because it is much easier to read. Excellent product for only $20."
3,Good Game,"Granstream Saga is a good game. It's easy, It allowed me to relax. Yes it has an intresting plot, and nice replay value, its battle format is one of the best, its graphics are up to my standards, and the animated sequenses are cool. However this game is very linear, its two short. The programers used up all the space on vidios and grapics. If you hate spending all your time gaining exp., than this it's worth it. If you like a really long and epic adventure than I can't recommend it."
4,A good rpg,"I have never played such an Rpg such as this one, no having to buy weapons and armor it's great! Granstream saga is nothing short of remarkable, a boy with a magic artifact that can turn ordinary pieces of metal into armor and weapons, you just can't beat that. If your looking for a good rpg than granstream saga is for you!"
5,"A forgotten, under-rated classic...","I really liked this game, the way it was set up, everything!I played this game on my brother's Playstation 4 years ago, andI really like this game! The sound effects and music are pretty good from what I have seen when I played this game 4 years ago. I do not remember much about this game, anyway, do not listen to these complainers who talk bad about this game, they are just a bunch of freaks who do not have appreciation for this PSX classic, and should not play it! Anyway, this forgotten treasure is worth a try, go for it!"
1,Stay away from this game!,"I have played this game, and I must say it is truly awful. Thank God I didn't buy it, only rented it. Still, it was a waste of five bucks. If you are an RPG fan, then you will probably agree that a lot of the fun in playing them is getting to explore caves, forests, towns, and all that. At least it is for me. I mean, what fun is an RPG if you don't get to go poking around in people's houses, looking for little treasures? This game has none of those fun little elements that are so enjoyable in other games I have known and loved. You are just, for the most part, magically transported to wherever you are supposed to go next, and forget being able to enter any of the buildings and look around! On top of that, the battles are too difficult. I was very disappointed in this game. Don't touch it!"
3,IT'S AN ALLRIGHT GAME EXCEPT IT LACKS ONE STORY LINE.,"IT NEEDED MORE ACTION AND LESS TRAVELING. THE GAME ITSELF HAS EXCEPTIONAL GRAPHICS ,BUT LACKS GAMEPLAY VALUE IN ACTION"
4,Great game,"I am in the early stages of the game, but I must say it's not bad so far. Kind of a Doom, with an ancient mistique. Easy to play, and the graphics, while not important to me, are not bad for the time period."
5,Fairly Priced,Go the item in a timely matter and the price was a little less than I pay at the local Sams Club abd it was good for 2 weeks not the usual 1 one
1,Dazzling Multicolor Swarovski Crystal String Earrings,Although they are pretty and my daughter liked them alot but the crystals are too heavy which caused the earrings to slide out of the ears. My daughter lost them a couple of times at home and we were able to find them but she can't wear them anymore.
3,expecting something else,The book came with a little bit of a suprise. I was expecting an original edition and got an edition which was edited by someone later. I order a first edition later.
4,the best show/the best game??,"Latly i`ve only been playing final fantasy (mainly ix and viii) so it was good to play a simple fighting game like this.Most of all I liked the clips from the show for the special moves.The fighting is simple and the special moves are easy to do,Just press the directional pad and triangle.so peace out and i hope this helped u enough"
1,boring,the inuyasha game was good but then it stunk there is only 3 mini games the attacks stink there is no fast people the people cant even attack when i want them to they cant jump this game is boring and stinks.
4,"InuYasha, truely the best game/show","I've got to tell you this game ROCKS!! You can be your fav charater and go on a journey to find the shards of the Shikon Jewl. Every thing is spoken in japanese, but they translate the important stuff into American words(ie.conversations with other charaters). I love how they put in the theme song in the game when to P.S starts up(I wacthed it like a million times), they also leave it unedited.Each charater (execpt Shippo, he has 4) has 3 speicial moves and 1 super specal moves. I can go on and on about how much I love this game, but I can't, so I hope this reveiw helps!"
5,Cool game!,"this is a must-have for any Inuyasha fan. The graphics are so-so, but the game is a lot of fun. The voices are in Japanese, so it is much more authentic. The subtitles are surprisingly accurate and the game is definetly worth buying."
3,Inuyasha the Video game,"This game was OK, but only because I'm in love with the anime show Inuyasha. The moves were easy, and I beat the game within a couple of days play. I like collecting all the different pictures in the game."
4,hella tight evenn for bandia,omg cool inu yasha on a game. the spoken words are in japanesse but dont worry there are subtitles. cool game! duh its inuyahsa hahha wooot sry excited well back to gaming hhave fun by it! notes 2 d fighting game includes specails of each chracter. not hard to pick up and play.
4,Good game ..Or not,OK i really liked this game i love the show and other related stuff related to Inuyasha.Inuyasha is a really neat game if you like fighting games ..I don't really care for them but i am a fan of the show so i bought it ..and i loved it it took me 3 min and 23 secs to beat it the frist time ..Wow ..not really it times the time you take in battle and it gets harder the father you get.Its got a pic book and music and mini game section.So even if you don't like fighting games aleast rent this its a good game..
3,"Great, but narrow spectrum","I grew up in California agriculture and the houses selected for this book bare little resemblence to Western farmhouses. All the houses are from east of the Mississippi, mostly East Coast and very old. There is one Texas farmhouse from the Civil War era.It seems that the design strategy of the owners has been to restore the old farmhouse ambience with older style elements. In California we try to reach the ambience of the farmhouse but with modern elements and techniques. If this is your objective then the book is still interesting but it won't give you much direct inspiration.I rate it three stars because the author forgot that the western US has its own farmhouse style and we happen to be American also. A more appropriate title would have been ""Colonial American Farmhouses"".- jim"
5,Fun to look at,I enjoy any book that shows good pictures with enhanced captions about the material being displayed and this is no exception.
3,Nice but limited,"I live in an old farmhouse myself, and what I was looking for was a more eclectic approach to showing how contemporary people adapt to these houses, both in terms of decor and functionality. The majority of interiors featured in the book are from 18th century (or earlier) houses - houses this old are unusual to non-existent in most of the country - and a majority also feature a very traditional style of decoration. On the other hand, there is some interesting information on regional architectural differences, and many beautiful photographs. Perhaps this book is intended more for a city-dweller with a dream..."
1,this game bite's,This game is the wrost ever!!!! I'd rather play pong then this it takes 2 memory card's to save one game.my memory card has to many important files just to use it for one game.
4,The focus is fun!,"This is a fun game for anyone who likes some light hearted beat 'em up action, but with allot of nice touches for Batman fans, especially for those who also enjoyed the Batman Animated Series. No other game I've played has captured the spirit of the material it was based on better than this game.The action is non-stop, and though some might say repetitive, I think the developers managed to keep the levels distinct, and the thugs you fight have interesting twists. The combo system is a blast, and Batman and his allies voice work and animations are clever and entertaining. There's allot of unlockable material, and the difficulty levels progress from easy to challenging.Great action game, a must for Batman fans."
3,Mediocre Beat Em' Up,"I remember renting this game a long time ago and somewhat enjoying it, so I decided to purchase it since it would be dirt cheap. The game isn't necessarily bad but it is certainly repetitive and the controls are aren't great. The best aspect of this game is the co-op, and I believe it is one of the few games where you can play as the incredibly underrated Nightwing. It's a decent buy if you or your pals love Batman and want to defeat some of the lesser used villains in the series like Scarecrow and Clayface."
3,At least NightWind was in it.,I played this game a couple of times but didn't finish the whole game. It's fun and amusing. Although the characters are kinda of slow. Too bad is only for 4 players. My little brothers haven't finish the game yet but so far is allright.
1,BAD BAD BAD,this game is repetative. all you do is rescue civilians and beat the bosses at the end of the level. that is all! nothing else! its really a bad game
2,Repetetive Trash,"You know this game is terrible, aside from some of the cut scenes there is no reason to ever get this game. Its the most repetitive game of all time. I hate this game. All you do is punch people and try to rescue hostages or disarm bombs. Every level is the same aside from some of the boss levels which are a relief because there is something different for once. The multi-player is awful, the only thing that makes it better is that there is someone else to share their dread with you. There is also this part where the dpad flips directions and that makes the game seem even more difficult and frustrating. Overall you should not get this game because it is worthless trash that should never be seen by human eyes. Or even played by innocent gamers. Hell Batman Vengeance is better than this, and while that game isn't great its still playable. Do yourself a favor and play the great Batman Arkham games instead of this."
1,bugs !!!,"This game has great graphics, great moves on the characters and it looks and feels like the animated show. Too bad it has wasn't really finished.First, the voices don't always comes out, second the music either sounds like an old scratched LP or doesn't sounds at all, and third and most important, it freezes.This game is hard to play and there's nothing wrong with it but having the game freeze several times while playing making you lost your progress it's frustrating.Too bad this game was not better debugged before release, don't buy it."
2,"Don,t buy this game!","This game is A OK when you start playing the game .BUT........beware this game SUCKS!all you have to do is save civilians, defuse bombs and defeat a bunch of bad guys.Buy better games like ""Lord of the rings : The return of the King OR WWE Samckdown Here comes the Pain""C, mon save your $19.99. And this game is also too short. I mean only 12 levels.But if u wanna buy this game fine , BUT IT,S YOUR BAD LUCK."
4,'' COOL BUT A BIT HARD '' ! !,"I REALLY ENJOYED '' BATMAN VENGEANCE '' , AND COULDN'T WAIT FOR THIS GAME TO COME OUT !! THE MULTIPLAYER MODES ARE COOL , BUT NOT EVERY CHARACTER CAN GET THE JOB DONE QUICKLY. THE PROS LIKE : '' BATMAN ''AND '' NIGHTWING'' ARE YOUR BEST CHOICES IN THE GAME. ''BATGIRL ''-IS COOL TOO , BUT LIL TIM DRAKE AS THE NEW ''ROBIN'' LACKS POWER IN HIS ATTACKS .SO THE PROBLEM ? IT TAKES YOU LONGER TO TAKE OUT ALL THE BAD GUYS.BUT YOU CAN USE TONS OF MOVES , AS WELL AS SOME NEAT COMBOS TO TAKE OUT THE BAD GUYS TOO..AND THE SMOKE BOMBS , BATARANGS , AND BATGRAPPLES MAKE COMBAT COOL TOO.AS WELL AS TOSSING STUFF AT YOUR ENEMIES TOO.THE BOSSES ARE NOT TOO HARD , BUT SOME STRATEGIES FOR CERTAIN BOSSES GET TIRED REAL FAST.BUT IN ALL IT IS A GREAT GAME , BUT I DOUBT YOU'LL WANT TO PLAY THE GAME A TOTAL OF 4 TIMES WITH ALL THE CHARACTERS AVAILABLE TO YOU. MAYBE 3 TIMES AT THE MOST..BUT IT'LL MAKE FOR LOADS OF FUN FOR SURE.SO GET IT TODAY!!ICAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT THE NEXT GAME WILL BE LIKE.."
4,One of the best Batman video games,"I have to give this game a thumbs-up. It's an action/fighting game, and a follow-up to Batman: Vengeance. Now that it's available at a reduced price, I would urge any Batfan to buy it. At full price or reduced price, Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu is fun and kept me interested in the storyline. Sin Tzu is a new mastermind, similar in scope to other international Batvillains Ra's al Ghul and Dr. Tzin-Tzin. You can play as either Batman or another member of the Gotham Guardians: Robin, Nigthwing, or Batgirl. You'll battle endless henchmen, as well as The Scarecrow, Clayface, and Bane. The controls are good, and the overall presentation immerses you into a three-dimensional version of the recent Batman cartoons. Overall, it's worth the purchase and playtime."
2,what kind of batman game is this???!!!!!!!,"Ok,what kind of batman game have you heard about,whear you can""t move freely? I don""t know why pepole don""t say stuff like that in there reviews but come on!!!!!! all the space you have is a tiny road to folow. and there is only like three or four gagets,and you can not jump good at all,the camera dosen""t even folow you some times.If you are a true batman fan then this game is a waste of money."
3,good....but not great,"batman rise of sin szu succeeds in injecting some new life into the beat em up genre with some old school thug bashing cooperative play. in that regard this game rocks. even though the story lacks depth and can be overly simplistic, anyone who enjoyed the batman animated series will enjoy the adventure. i was also glad to see that all the original voice actors were invlolved and the game also has some decent bonus features which i think more games should do. all in all, anyone looking for a double dragon/turtles in time style melee action should give this game a try, double if your a batman fan. on a side note, this game isnt that great from a single player point of view, so if you dont have anyone to share the thug bashing with...rent first."
3,Barely an atlas,"After hearing a discussion of this book on NPR, I ordered this book expecting a thorough atlas of the ocean floor. I was sorely disappointed. Although there are some good maps in this book, the bulk of the book deals with other topics such as: ecology or the need for protecting our oceans, current temperatures, predicting El Nino, etc. Don't get me wrong, it is a good book but it is far from what I expected. Full of pretty photographs and illustrations as usual for a National Geographic effort. I believe that the hype made me believe the book would have details associated with a land atlas."
3,"Outstanding photographs, interesting maps, dodgy text.","If you are looking for a coffee book with excellent illustrations I would definately recommend this book. Should you wish to read it I would hesitate on recommending it. The text is disjointed and the main topic of a paragraph is often confused with numerous (tentatively linked) topics. Issues are readdressed time and time again, which leads me to think the book is more a series of strung together papers rather than a well thought out book. However, if you don't mind that, the book does introduce many interesting people involved in marine science and as I said, the illustrations are outstanding."
5,Great protection,"This is a great case, soft, yet durable and very fancy. I love it because my 3 year old usually is taking my things and asking what they are, and with this case I'm not worried that he would scratch or damage my Harry Potter Lumos Light."
3,Too long and not worth the time to play,This is not one of the best games to play. It's very long and seems to continue on and on without really a satisfying ending for the time. I would not recommend it to anyone.
1,Don't buy this game!!!!!!!!,This is the worst RPG Game ever. The people are so tiny like rats i don't even play it i only played it once. Don't buy this game it don't make sense at all!!!!!!!
5,Definatly worth it...,"I bought this game on the recomendation of a friend. The graphics are not the best but the music, character develoment, and game play are great. This is NOT an easy, finish it in one sitting, kind of game. There are places in the game that you actually have to THINK (a novel idea when it comes to games). There's plenty here to keep a RPGers interest long enough to finish it. Look past the graphics to the heart of things... great gameplay. (Okay, not ALL the graphics are bad, the opening sequence is beautiful!)"
4,4 1/2 stars,"See storyline above.This is definitely a scientific thriller. The research and knowledge possessed by Mr. Powlik shows up in abundance in this tale of adventure. You'll learn a little bit about everything from Bacterial sciences to nuclear physics, tidbits of Chernobyl to the species balaenoptera. An adventure in the Artic should bring vivid pictures to the mind, and it does. Although there is more science than adventure in this novel, I liked it because I like science.Recommended for science lovers who like adventure."
2,tough tough read,"I didn't make it to the end of this book - I really didn't see the point. I suppose if you believe the United States miitary is the center of evil in the world and they are resposnible for defiling the environment this might be your kind of book.Like most people, I thought the book's premise reasoble, but the author never really pulls it off. There are all sorts of things that are being set up and go absolutely no where.Finally, I did not understand the motivations for a number of the second tier characters."
1,actually less than 1 star,"The premise of this book was good and should have resulted in a real page turner. This, for me, was not the case. I found the writing extremely boring . I kept turning pages hoping to find improvement. NO SUCH LUCK. This book is easily one of the worst I've read in recent years."
3,Page 198,"It is a good yarn, but with one problem. The book is about 330 pages long. However, on page 198 -- the ending is essentially revealed and all the rest is simply detail. I do not think that adhearance to the golden mean dictates this."
2,Meltdown by James Pawlick - author did not do homework,"The author has a good start for an interesting science fiction yarn with an underlying environmental message. However he did not do his homework in a number of scientific fields. What kept me going was to discover error after error in the fields of nuclear reactors, nuclear and isotope chemistry, nuclear waste management work, and chemistry in general."
3,Worth watching once,I don't see how this film got such high ratings even though it did have it good points it was a super cheaply made movie. A bigger budget may have helped it a bit but I can't bring myself to give it more than 3 stars for effort. The script was ok and some of the actors were able to carry their lines but to be honest it was a chore setting through it. Worth watching once if you got the time to kill.
4,Loved every minute of it.,"A good little movie to scratch a comedy horror itch. I loved the movie. The effects and writing were solid. The jokes were funny and honestly the makeup was amazing for a low budget film. Loved the characters, all of the actors were great. I hear that a sequel is in the works and I can't wait to see it."
4,Go independent film!,"This is an independent film, from the low- to no-budget category, but it is an original humorous take on the horror genre that works. I wish it were longer, but I also realize it is a labor of love for all involved, doing what they enjoy doing. This group may be making it big one day..."
1,An introduction to Perl,"This book is a gives a gentle introduction to Perll; by the time you have gone through this book, you would have touched on some very simple operations and common language idioms found in Perl. This is not a comprehensive guide; on the contrary the book is selective about covering only those constructs and issues that one is most likely to face early on in programming with Perl.This does not collect any of the more powerful feature in Perl like Reference; Data Structures; Manipulating lists of list.I would not recomend this book."
2,Learning? This book is confusing on purpose!,"It's amazing how this book could become so popular.The set of examples is very confusing.The authors seem to be trying to break the world record of code ""compactness"" or something.I understand the language is very powerful and allows to write compact code, but this is definetly not the right thing to do while learning a new language, at least not if you do it at the expense of clarity.In my opinion, a good programming introductory book (as this one intends to be, from the name) should teach one concept at a time, and give very clear examples.I don't recommend this book."
5,Single best intro - do not be fooled by bad reviews,"This is the single best intro into perl. It's a small book but covers *ALL* the perl essentials in a straightforward way without burdening you with tons of details. I learned perl from this book on unix and on windows, and moreover it was a fine read as it happens to be well written. Don't be fooled by reviews stating it's for unix hackers, this is just NOT true. Although perl has its roots in unix, perl IS perl, it's about the language and it's the same for 99% whether you are learning it on ux or on windows - it's os agnostic and that's one of it's strengths. You need more details, you get some experience ? Go for the Wall book, the Friedl book on regular expressions or the perl cookbook (or just buy them altogether, it's a great set)."
4,Clear and well-written,"This is the first programming book that I read cover to cover. It provides an excellent introduction to perl, very readable, and the exercies were very accessable. I felt that the book was rather light and didn't go in-depth to certain important issues. Regardless, I purchased the sequel, Intermediate Perl, which this book has plenty of plugs for, and am very satisfied with Learning Perl as a whole. Due to the friendly and quality writing style, I definitely recommend this book to anyone with slight programming experience and interest in perl."
2,How to write unmaintainable code,"I've been programming for a long time, C/C++, some Java, PHP, shell scripts, awk, etc. I needed a way to learn perl fast for a project, and a colleague recommended this book.There's a lot of unreadable unmaintainable perl code out there, and books like this a probably a primary contributor to that. The authors seem to go out of their way to avoid writing clear code, constantly saying things like ""well, you could write it this way, but perl programmers consider that a waste of typing,"" instead preferring to depend on hidden variables and the wide range of default behaviors that are perl.The book is organized in a peculiar way that made it hard to find things: I don't usually expect to find descriptions of control constructs such as loops only in chapters about arrays.I've come to see that its quite possible to write clear maintainable perl, but this book encourages poor coding habits."
5,Total Satisfaction...,"After some researching on the web, Amazon comes through. Being a Mac user (G4 Mirror Drive Doors), selections are few out there but this Samsung 215TW is awesome. Product arrived on time with an additional DVI Cable. I plugged everything together, supplied power, and I'm amazed. Nice crisp and bright color for a change! Can't beat this for the price I payed, after looking at many more that cost at least a hundred more. Plus, I can use this to watch TV, Videos, etc., too!"
5,An excellent choice for photo editing,"I purchased this monitor on ebay for $370 including shipping, and I couldn't be happier with it. I'm using it with my powerbook for photo editing, and I love how much extra space I have. The monitor is huge compared to what I'm used to, and the colors and brightness of the monitor are excellent. I love the swivel as well as the vertical tilt. I LOVE this monitor!"
2,Just Search the OSHA website,"On the plus side, this book is a nice compilation of construction safety information. On the negative side, however, some of the chapters in this book follow OSHA publications almost word-for-word. This book could have expanded more on the OSHA subjects, rather than just repeat everything out of the OSHA publications.I decided to return the book and instead just download copies of the OSHA publications from the OSHA website (it's free!)."
3,Prints great! If you can get it to work..,"I purchased this printer for Christmas. It printed out great pictures,documents and information from the web. But by week 2, the paper was getting jammed. Called HP support and had husband look and fix printer. A wheel had come off. Still printer printed great again for about another two weeks. Just when I was about to file the most import income taxes, the printer just started making this strange noise and sliding back and forth on that metal wheel inside. Now it wont print,move,make noise or anything. I think it has died. Best I can tell you is that you will love this printer untill it start to come apart."
1,HP is trying to trick you,"This would be a good printer for [the price]. Unfortunately, that is not the true price. It does not come with a black ink cartridge or a parallel port connection. When you buy the cartridge and the USB cable, the true cost is [a bit higher]. This is not a good [....] printer [for the total cost]. If you already have the USB cable and you don't plan on printing much text, then buy this printer."
1,HP deskjet 3320 Review,"We bought our HP DeskJet 3320 in Summer, 2003. It was well taken care of, but broke by December, 2003."
1,Don't do it!,"I bought this cheap printer because I don't do much printing. Not only did it often print skewed printouts, it stopped working after 5 months or so. Some spring popped out, and it just makes a grinding noise instead of taking the paper in. And it was still on its first ink cartridge, we used it so little. Please do yourself a favor and spend a little more and get a printer that will last longer."
4,"Not the best printer, but gets the job done.","I was in college when I bought this sucker (five years ago) and it's still kicking. It's not the prettiest printer, but it gets the job done and it was cheap. If you're looking for a simple printer that is used relatively infrequently, this guy will be trusty for quite a long time."
3,Razor blades.,Just like razors and blades. The razor (printer) is low price and the blades (ink) is expensive. Works great but costly to operate.
1,it's priced what it's worth,"This printer has great quality & speed for print outs. However, after 5 months, the printer head assembly (the part that holds the ink cartridges) broke & would not move any more. There is only a 90 day warranty for a reason. On a positive note, the ink carts are cheap. On the down side, they are cheap because their capacity is smaller than the average cart.I replaced it with the HP DJ 3820...rated very highly & seems to be built to last."
1,Hang on to your receipt,"I don't do very much printing, so my printers tend to last several years. This one lasted a few months at best, and I had to replace the ink cartridges almost monthly. The cartridges are just as expensive as the printer itself. This printer is pretty much a plan to keep you spending [$] on HP supplies every month."
4,Disposable printers rule,"Well, it might not be a very good quality printer, but hey, I bought a bunch of them when they were on sale at the local supermarket. They actually cost less than a new inkt cartridge for my other printer (HP Designjet 120). And still it prints out 1200x600 dpi, 8 pages b&w text with the optional black cart (which I got for free when I bought the printers. And I must say, the prints look pretty good.Anyway, these printers are dead cheap and IMHO perfect for people who dont print very much, or like me, take it with me to LAN-parties and stuff (you can't imagine how popular you are when you're the only one there with a printer :) And hey, it's so cheap that it doesn't matter if it breaks or gets nicked... I throw mine out when the carts empty anyway :)Oh, and it is compact too, which is a big advantage when u are living on a boat :)"
1,"Glad it is being discontinued, didn't last past 6 months","I am glad there will be no more victims of this printer. Although the printer prints exceptionally well for the price and has a wonderful light weight feel to it, there is a strong chance it won't last you 6 months even with minimal usage. Many people complain the printer broke on them, this and the similar light weight models. It seems a little piece inside of the printer wears and breaks off in no time. These printers are said to have a ""light weight technology"" more like cheap plastic technology to me. I went through 2 of these printers and similar in one year, first the 3420 and then the 3320 which did the same thing in less than 6 months. I don't do much printing and reading these reviews I realized it's not the users fault. HP is a great brand when it comes to printers, however, I suggest you go with a much higher up printer that will give you your monies worth."
1,DON'T BUY THIS PRINTER !!!,"This is not an HP printer as you remember them. This is poorly built and will fail as soon as it's out of warrantee. As a matter of fact, mine warrantee was only 6 months.BUYER BEWARE !!!"
1,"Deskjet 3320 - 0 Wins, 2 Losses",I work at a school and have had two 3320's break in the past week. HP's aren't what they used to be when you consider that there are still a lot of DeskWriter C's and DeskWriter/DeskJet 500 series printers still working on campus. Shame on HP for not fixing the design and continuing to sell printers with the same fatal flaw!
1,Just a bit better than flushing your money down the toilet,"Where to begin? I have a Deskjet 400 (yes, 400) that I still use for my everyday printing needs, only had a problem once when I dropped it and it even fixed itself, plus it was an entry level printer. Based on that, I recommended that my mother buy a cheap HP for her occasional printing.This 3320 however is barely worth the plastic it's made of. It's the noisiest printer I've ever come across and you'd probably need a gallon tank of ink to get through a year. Worst of all, as you can tell from the earlier reviews, this printer has a track record for becoming a paperwight in record time; my personal experience was 2 months.Do yourself and your wallet a favor, get a little more cash together and buy a better printer. They say you get what you pay for, but even at the price it's not worth the aggravation."
1,CHEAP CHEAP,"I have used this printer maybe a total of 15 times. The print cradle broke, and now it won't print because the print cartridges won't move across the page like they're supposed to. Very poor quality - SHAME on HP for even selling this."
1,A piece of junk after 6 months,I bought one of these new for my office so that any sensitive documents I print don't have to be fetched from a public printer. I printed maybe 50 pages on it over half of a year before it broke. Now it just makes a horrible loud ratcheting sound when I turn it on. It appears to be the same problem as described in other reviews.Buy something else. HP: Kill this product now.
4,"I WANT to go to heaven - no if, ands or buts!!","Because of my purposeful separation of religion (my beliefs), pleasure and business, I am not often ""moved"" to discuss, or even read, books of this nature. However, my godchild was visiting and had just experienced Craig McNair Wilson ""live"" and had purchased his book. I picked it up - and couldn't put it down. He has an incredible approach to imparting his message with humor, criticism and profundity. The meat of this book lies in McNair's ability to discuss the Bible and Christianity without elevating himself - and relating to it on a practical level. It is hysterical - and meaningful. Real-life words with open criticism to some beliefs and practices. Great for teens and older. Easy reading - great cartoons."
2,Nothing new or noteworthy here.,"A very quick read but nothing new, noteworthy, or compelling here. It brings an occasional smile but falls far short of its billing."
1,Just say no....,"I imagine this book would've been highly informative, and possibly highly entertaining when put to practical use... if it weren't for the fact that on about 30 or 40 pages, all at key points in the explanation of a particular tactic or technique, the bottom portion of the page is cut off. Apparantly when this book was printed, they decided it would be amusing to leave out all the key information that people actually bought the book for. I was, needless to say, rather upset when the first copy came in like this, but when the second copy came in and had the exact same mis-prints as the first, I was a little more than upset or disappointed. But to top it off, when I specifically asked for a store credit instead of a replacement, and got a replacement anyway, I was even more upset. This is a waste of time, and money, and if it were possible to give it no stars, I would."
2,This game sucks!!!,This game is the most boring game ive ever played!its dumb and it sucks. I rate this game a D- because its too boring and its exremley dumb.don't buy it.
4,All round shoe,"This shoe is a good looking shoe that goes well with jeans and that you can dress up with a sportcoat and nice slacks. Not quite dressy enough for a suit. They did not require a break in period and are very comfortable. The color is great, between a brown and a cordovan but they go well with brown, grey, and navy. They are a little bit ""chunkier"" looking than the ""Headly"" model, but still very good looking."
3,J&M Dunst,"Got these last week and found that the top eyelet on the right shoe had come loose. I took it to the local cobbler and for $5, he fixed it. The shoe is definitely brown. Very comfortable right out of the box due to the rubber sole. Seems to be true to size, and with decent arch support. Not a dressy shoe, works best with chinos or jeans. The pair I got was made in China. Other than the eyelet problem, nice shoe."
2,Looks good. Can't say the same for the fit/feel.,"These look very nice. They don't fit or feel very nice, though. Very stiff, very clunky, and there is too much of a gap between my heel/Achilles and the back of the shoe. You get what you pay for. Got these on sale. Would definitely not pay MSRP. Too bad, as these do look very nice and can be dressed up or down with ease."
3,"Good, but.....","Good book, but the ""Ilustrated Buyers Guide"" on the cars will give you the same info and then some. Unfortunately the ""illustrated Buyers Guide"" only covers up to 1998 production year."
4,"Nice, little story","This is an enjoyable, light story from the days of books that made you happy to read. Not overly predictable."
4,romance in 1910,"A rich American girl, Cynthia, is touring the UK acompanied by a chaperon. Because of a weird turn of circumstances the chauffeur is the rich, young Viscount Medenham, posing as a simple chauffeur. The Lord falls in love with Cynthia, but before he can hold her in his arms, he first has to win her love even though Cynthia believes he is just a chauffeur, and deal with: a French Comte who wants to marry Cynthia, the scheming chaperon, and relatives of both himself and Cynthia who oppose their union.This book is a charming little romance with a bit of mystery in it, and it is worth reading for anyone who loves a sweet romance story. This romance was first published in 1910, the printed edition has 249 pages."
3,"How I Shot Down ""Pappy"" Boyington in WWII","U.S. Library of Congress # 78-112803, at least seven printings in small hardback by 1978, with 172 pages in English; published by ""Printing Dynamics, Inc."" of Phoenix, AZ. The author was a Japanese fighter pilot during World War II. He shot down 16 Allied airplanes. He details how he joined the Japanese naval air force in 1943, recounts how he shot down various Allied planes -- including his downing of the U.S. Navy's top air ace: ""Pappy"" Boyington -- and how he met Boyington after the war. As Boyington's air unit was known as the ""Bah Bah Black Sheep"" squadron, Kawato impishly titled his book: ""Bye Bye Black Sheep."" Kawato describes how he was finally shot down, swam to shore, and captured by the Australians. After the war he joined the Japan Self-Defense Air Force. I met him in 1991 in Seattle, and he was gracious in autographing a copy of his book for me."
3,silva ko'íng leben,"anderson silva demolishing chris leben and rich franklin are the only reasons to watch this dvd. elvis sinosic vs forest griffen was another notable bout. watch, don't buy"
1,Don't buy this book,I thought this book was about the autobiography of Benjamin Franklin. This is not the book I was thinking about. It was a book written by Benjamin Franklin but which is written after he wrote his famous autobiography. The book did not contain the contents of his autobiography but contains his writings that were written during his last years that was not included in his widely read autobiography.The book title says it is 'compleated' autobiography. The book's title should be 'Last memoirs of Benjamin Frankilin'
5,Great book for History Buffs,"I gave this as a gift to my mother. My father read it cover to cover and enjoyed it and my mother is in the process of doing so. It is written in an older style and can be a bit dry, but history buffs (my parents) are really enjoying it."
2,Sore toes.,Thought from other reviews these would be comfortable but the seem to rub baby toes raw even with socks on. Just my opinion.
2,uncomfortable,"There is a ridge on the inside of the shoe from side to side, right under the ball of the foot, that caused great pain in a couple of hours; returned for a refund. Other than that, they were comfortable and easy to walk in; very disappointed about the ridge."
4,Klogs USA dark red clogs,"These clogs take some getting used to, but within the first day of wearing, they were comfortable by the end of the day."
3,Noisy!,"These are made of something like rubber so they don't breathe and they make weird sucking sounds when you walk. But they're comfy! They do run small, I had to return pair #1 for a larger size and they're still tight, but do-able."
5,best work shoes,i work in a restaraunt. and these have been the best shoes for me theyr slip and oil resisitant as well as waterproof
1,Returned as soon as I got them,"These shoes are made out of the weird plastic stuff that crocs are made out of. They look cheap, and do not offer enough support. They didn't breathe, and didn't have enough cushion on the bottom. Even though they looked like the would be light like crocs, they were surprisingly heavy - almost like the company put weights in the soles. It was weird."
2,Toasty toes,"These shoes are comfortable with nice squishy soles, but they will certainly keep your feet toasty warm! I am disappointed at how easily they scuff up, I haven't even worn them for two weeks and the toes are all scuffed up and there is a huge scuff running across the top of one shoe. I have no idea how that even happened. i'm not hard on my shoes at all- I'm a receptionist so I spend most of my time sitting at my desk. I don't think they were worth the price considering how bad they look after only two weeks."
2,Returned,"Was man made materials, returned. My feet would sweat to much in them. NIce looking shoe too badfast shipper, easy return"
3,Practical,"These shoes are practical. however they get very warm and i dont wear them as often as I would like to, because of that."
3,Not the ones I thought/,"I thought this was the style I had worn before, it's not and I will be returning them and trying to get the ones I like better. The lining in this shoe wasn't comfortable without wearing socks and I didn't want to do that all the time. Klogs are wonderful shoes and I had a pair I wore until I had to just throw them away, hated doing it, they were the most comfortable shoes I ever wore. I will be hunting some with a different lining."
4,Comfy but Heavy!,"I'm a dentist and am constantly shuffling from patient to patient. I think these shoes are great for people who are on their feet a lot. I also tend to suffer from ""flat feet"", and I find these shoes provide sufficient arch support.Overall, great looks, comfy feel, provide a small heel. They do scuff to a minor degree, but I've never had the sweaty/damp problem that other posters have mentioned.I find they are true to size (may want to go up half size for thick socks).My only real gripe is that these shoes are super heavy, which one would notice if they walk around a lot in these shoes. For that reason, I also LOVE my other pair of work shoes - Merrell Encore Breeze 2. I am also going to check out Dansko shoes, which are also known to be super sturdy but lighter in weight than these Klogs."
4,Comfortable,I bought these because I wanted a pair of comfortable gray mules. I had trouble finding a pair that were both cute and comfortable. These fit the bill. You do need socks because without them your feet will be too sweaty.
3,Klogs clogs,"I didn't realize these clogs were molded polyuraehane (sp). They look like molded something or other and they are HOT. I don't mean fashionably cool, I meet they make your feet hot, sweaty. That been said...they are great in the rain. My feet don't get wet and the shoes have a deep enough sole that the shallow puddles don't stop me either. Don't think I'd buy another pair. We'll see. As far as fit, they are comfortable."
2,Made my feet sweaty!,"For me this shoe was on the narrow side. It just fit without socks, however I wanted to be able to wear socks in cold weather. Although it felt comfortable support-wise, being on my feet all day, the shoe did not breathe at all and made my feet sweaty. Yecchhh. I returned it."
4,An excellent work shoe,"I stand on my feet all day at work, and I will wear nothing but these shoes. They provide great arch support as well as a cushy sole to keep legs from getting tired too quickly. When the insoles wear out, I replace them with either a Klogs brand replacement insole or with the Dr. Scholl's insoles you can buy at any drug store. The clogs themselves last for years. The only thing keeping me from giving them 5 stars is that fact that the color wears off the toe of them over time. Not a problem for the black clogs, but it is for the brown. All in all, an excellent buy and well worth the money."
5,Comfortable and durable,"I love these shoes. They are so comfortable and easy to slip on. Sore spots on the bottoms of my feet don't bother me when I wear these shoes. These shoes are weather resistant and easy to wipe clean after working in the garden. I also wear these shoes for work, in the laboratory; they are great for chemical resistance. I don't know what I would do without them."
3,not bright enough,"I thought that since this light had 3 LEDs it would be very bright. My XLC light had only one LED and it was much brighter. Also, this takes 4 AA batteries, making it somewhat heavy and cumbersome. My XLC took 3 AAA batteries."
4,"a reader from Chandler, Arizona , March 28, 2000",Such a beautiful book. They way Ash let his butterfree go just to let him be happy. i cried when the book ended.
4,Butterfree Book,"I just want to say that I think this is one of the best Pokemonbooks ever. In the book, Ash has to set his Butterfree free so it cango and have babies. The book could help kids dealing with letting go of something they love, like Ash did."
5,A fine book,"This book may be concise but it is nevertheless absorbing. Probably the best text available on the topic, and excellently written also. Recommended."
1,sucks!,"they send a diffirent shoes from the picture and its ugly... i want to send it back and just return it, but you have to pay $15 restocking that's sucks...i also pay an expensive delivery...it's not really worth it. it sucks!"
1,"Too precious for words, or Dilettantissimo","Even the self-parodying Oscar Wilde, I feel, knew the difference in his heart between art and artiness. The joke was on us. I love still life, but this is stilted, affected writing. 'At dinner at my friends', I was seated with my back to the painting, but I felt its magnetism.' Purleeze! 'If you could see the notes of a cello...that would be the poetry of [the painter in question].' You need a strong constitution for this kind of thing, which is not art criticism but mush. Apart from the technical bits about pigment, which is still not aesthetics. For a good amateur take on the genre, Chapter 6 of Marjorie Garber's Quotation Marks is be hard to beat. So good I bought it twice (I think)"
1,misleading,"I bought this item because it says toggle switch, but when item arrived in a rather large box about 12x12 i thought maybe i got more than i bargainedfor, until i open the box and see 4 big air bags and a small zip lock bag with 7 washers in then and that's all. tried to contact amazon with no help, TRUST ME DO NOT BUY THIS UNLESS YOU THINK % BUX IS A FAIR PRICE FOR & TINY WASHERS."
4,Excellent for the price,"I received this for Christmas. I have never been able to get my planes sharp with the bench-mounted wheel I have. This works great. I sharpened a hand plane and was able to finally get the little shavings I see on woodworking shows. The unit is almost all plastic and seems prety cheaply made, it does do a pretty good job. At around $50 it is a great deal for someone that does not do a great deal of sharpening."
1,save your money,"this is a piece of pure junk. the plastic jig (for chisels) is not rigid, and therefore flexes. The result is an angle on your chisels that is far from perfect."
1,Landfill fodder - returning immediately,The guides are useless. How can you get a precision edge on a tool when your sharpening tool has no precision? And underpowered. Try something else.
2,Doesn't slice smoothly,I wasn't aware that this used a blade vs a wire for slicing. The blade tears the cheese instead of slicing it smoothly. I threw it away and consider it a lesson in checking before buying.
2,"it is not a wire slicer,just get the description right..not happy",this sucks.......we wanted a wire slicer and that is not what we got.........we are not happy with this product and now we have to pay shipping back and still don`t have a wire slicer.........
2,Its Okay.,"Not real happy with it. It rips the cheese rather than slicing through it. Will get the wire string next time. The Board is nice, and a nice broad size, I like that."
1,not a happy birthday present,I bought this slicer as a birthday present. I wanted a slicer with a wire and thought that was what I ordered. The slicer blade was not aligned right from the start. After about 2 months it broke apart. Birthday boy tried to fix it and ruined the wooden base. I could not find a way to register a complaint with the manufacturer.
2,Could be a lot better,Very disappointed in this one. Graphics are fair and realism is only fair. I think they rushed this one to production.
4,This blooper tape was very funny and a must have.,It had alot of people on it and it was very funny because it not to old. Must have.
4,Formulas for the experimental painter,"This book is essential if you are interested in making your own style. Formulas for Painters is a cookbook full of sizing,paints,grounds, mediums, glazes, varnishes, fixatives, and adhesive recipes for the artist that wants more then what they can find in an over-priced art supply store."
3,art technique,I purchased this book for an artist friend as a gift and he reported thatit was a unique reference source for practical art materials usage anda valuable asset to his art library.
2,"formulas for ""chemics""","not helpful as I thought. it is so technical, I am an artist, no a paint solution maker."
2,Not solidly built,"I was looking for a replacement salt shaker & pepper mill combination set, and didn't want to spend more than I could afford. This set just was a disappointment in several ways.First off, they arrived damaged. There were scuff/abrasion marks that went around the entire circumference of the metal tops. I thought maybe the scuffs would rub off with a microfiber cloth, but, no.Secondly, they were pretty light in weight and felt cheaply made. I know...you get what you pay for.Thirdly, and this was the deal-breaker, the pepper adjustment really didn't change the grind that much. You have coarse and a little less coarse.I returned them as defective and the return was processed w/no hassle."
5,Found 'em!,Saw in restaurant in NC and started hunting. Great product - especially salt shaker - closes when not in use and stops humidity clumping. No more adding rice!!!! Pepper mill has 4 settings of grind. Do caution that salt will come out in a hurry - better than not at all. Highly recommend.
2,It is a lexicon,"This book needs structure. Themas are alphabetically sorted, but are not organized according their semantical contents.The following sentence from ""Jules Henri Poincare"" may be the best description for this book:Science is built up of facts as a house is built of stones, BUT an accumulation of facts is no more a science than a heap of stones is a house.This book gives you all ingredients, but does not tell you how to be a good cook. It does not give you the aim.Problems are isolated, but not related. They are just sorted in alpabetical order without context, like the heap of stones..."
5,"A powerful, pithy discussion of specifying solutions","A great deal of software uses the ""where the arrow lands, draw the target"" approach. Jackson presents formal terms and techniques to pursue an alternative. Anyone collecting requirements and writing specifications will find benefit from this book. His discussion of various problem frames is wonderful.The book is written in tool box style, and Jackson makes clear that he believes in fitting the right method to the task at hand.Thought provoking and well written, the book borders on philosophy (epistemology) and predicate logic in places, something I enjoyed. Jackson's analogy between predicate logic and assembly language is most apt.Highly recommended."
5,Wow! Great CD set for a really great cause.,"This two CD set, RESPOND, is a fantastic 27 song compilation by female Boston singers. It was put together as a benefit album for RESPOND Inc., a Somerville, Massachusetts-based domestic violence program that serves women and children. It is a wonderful collection and I particularly enjoy the contributions of Lori McKenna and Catie Curtis. Give it a listen - great music for a great cause and remember, Mother's Day is coming up!"
5,Music that I wanted to sing to...,"This CD set is not only a great compilation of artists for a worthy cause, it is also the kind of music that you will find yourself humming, and maybe even singing, along with as well. These CDs make long car rides fly by... The variety of artists made this a great present for friends whose tastes are difficult to define."
5,Now More Than Ever Before&#65533;Instead of Eminem,"If you are saddened and dismayed by things like Eminem, this is the album to buy to save some lives that could be ruined or destroyed by misogyny. The Patty Larkin song alone is worth it but all the rest are brave and beautiful."
4,What a great piece of Gear...,"Several decades ago I bought and used a BBE unit in my home studio. I had several people hear my recordings and state my sounds were the best home recordings they had ever heard (in terms of quality and not composition). I attributed the high quality to the BBE. Recently I decided to build another home recording studio, this time all digital, and start writing and producing music again. I had to have a Maxcom in the chain to make the studio complete. BBE has done a fabulous job with this unit. One might reason that combining all the features into one box would compromise the quality. They would be wrong... If you are into making music, you need this unit. You will be amazed by the sound. Like most things very useful, after using it on your first composition, you won't want to be without it...I highly recommend it..."
5,4 PIECES OF GEAR IN ONE,"Goodness GOD... I can't say enough about this thing. Compressor/Limiter/Gate and a Maximizer. In less space than a Rack Amp.If you trim this thing out just right for microphones, you can scream at the top of your lungs into the mic and get clear vocals on the other side. I bought this unit to help out with my in home studio and its uses are limitless. At that point I wasn't sure whether it would be useful to me, I was pretty ""FNG"" to buying these little trinkets. Since buying my last load of equipment in FEB, I have used this while I was running sound for a Pop/Alt Rock/Groove band. Unfortunatley, the gig wasn't long lasting enough, but they were impressed not only with how hard I work, but at how well I managed the sound.I would recommend this to any person looking for its capabilities. It was and always will be worth every dime I paid for it. It's a no risk deal, you can't go wrong. Im purchasing 5 more in the future to help with drum mics, LOL.Peace, LOVE, and Vacuum Tubes"
5,I wish it were still in print!,"I bought a copy of this some 15 years ago, when it was still in print, and quickly picked up copies for my best friend and my mom. I bake on and off during the year but extensively at the holidays, and this book remains my easily-accessible, portable bible for Christmas cookies. I looked all over for it this year to send as a special gift for my godson, who's now old enough to be interested in baking, and was devastated to learn that it's been out of print for years. I have a full copy of Joy, but some of these recipes aren't in there; moreover, the small format and beautiful photos make this very useful when it comes time to plan out my holiday baking each year. I'll treasure my copy even more now that I know it would be difficult indeed to replace it."
4,Nice display piece.,The child in me made me buy this toy. Wish it had come out 40 years ago because I would have an absolute blast with it. Now it's just an ornament on my desk and a fitting tribute to Heath Ledger's superlative performance of a villain extraordinaire in The Dark Knight. Nice display piece though.
2,disapointed,"its not easy to put a bag in, it sticks out the edges.. and its smaller than I expetd.. nothing special.. feel like the high price was a waste of money"
4,Nice looking trash can....,"I really like this can. A regular 13 gallon kitchen bag fits well, and the little latch that holds the bag from falling into the can works reasonably well. My only initial complaint is the noise the lid makes when it comes down. It sounds like Dracula closing up his crypt for the morning. However, a little WD-40 has remedied that situation. My kitchen has a red theme to it, and this can looks great. The color really is a fire engine red."
2,Not near as sturdy as it should be,"For the price of this product I expected a very durable and sturdy trash can. To my dissapointment that is not what I got. I would have returned it but the box was already thrown away. Very hard for bags to stay in unless you buy the ones that have the elastic band on top. Otherwise they don't stay in, even with the clip inside that was designed to hold the bag in place. Wish I could get my money back for this purchase. Too late now."
3,Expensive trash can,I bought this a year or so ago and in that time a plastic piece broke off (with only normal use) and not it makes a clanging sound whenever the top is opened. This is quite annoying that for such an expensive can there are flimsy plastic parts. I would not purchase this again.
1,Flimsy and Broken,"If there were a negative number rating, I'd seriously consider it. If you are single and travel all the time, this is a good fit for your home. For the rest of us carbon-based life forms who generate garbage, this is not your friend. After a few short months of NORMAL usage, the lid has completely fallen off. It never worked correctly anyway, as the trashcan was 'tweaked' right out of the box so that the lid never opened and closed easily. It just got worse over time. The other trash cans like ""SimpleHuman"" are much more substantial. Because of Amazon's return policy, I'll be keeping this piece of garbage..for the time being...Just long enough to find an even bigger and better can to stuff it into."
2,Looks nice but too big,"The trash can looks nice but it sticks out way too far from the wall. The can is also not at all quiet as described, and the shape is rather odd - narrow and tall. I have to return it unfortunately."
3,Loved it while it lasted,"Received this as a Christmas gift in December of 2010, May 23rd 2011 it broke. A part of the lid broke, should have known since it was made of plastic. I loved this red can in my kitchen, it made such a statement. Now it just another piece of trash in the kitchen that needs to be tossed out. Do yourself a favor and get a different can so you won't be as disappointed as I am."
5,Good introduction to entering school,"This book would be appropriate for children entering preschool or kindergarten. It introduces some of the basic elements of a day at school. It's a nice reading companion to the Blues Clues DVD/video ""Blue Takes You to School"""
1,Broke cutting a potato,"These knives make it appear that the metal of the blade goes all the way through the handle full thickness when it is actually just a thin piece on either side. I was cutting a potato in half and the entire knife just broke in half right where the blade meets the handle. One of the sides of the metal in the handle just fractured. I have only had the knives about 2 months and took good care of them, always hand washing etc. They are cheap knives for a reason. I agree they cut well but come on if it can't cut a potato without snapping in half whats the point."
2,Accurate?,"This in no way, shape, or form represents what John Mayer is actually playing. Yes, if you play this, it may sound similar to the song, but nowhere near accurate. The Room For Squares (Guitar TAB) does indeed display an accurate representation of what John Mayer plays, and I would suggest that you wait until a similar product is published for Heavier Things."
1,"Doesn't help you ""play it like it is""","Don't buy this if you want to play his songs on guitar! It's more suited for piano, there's not even tabulatures, just chords. The ""play it like it is"" is just bulls*t. It's very simplified and if your want to play it on guitar it will not help you at all...sorry."
4,Heavier Things tab book,"For guitarists with previous knowledge of reading music, chords, and tab, this book is a breeze (however playing it is a whole different thing...John Mayer writes some difficult stuff!) For a beginning guitarist, I think it will be very challenging from a playing standpoint, but for those looking for a challenge, and eager to learn, have at it! I highly recommend the book to all, there are many online music/tab websites out there, and 99% of it is wrong. With this book, and others like it, you KNOW you'll be playing it the right way."
3,Careful! Product not for use in high efficiency front-loader machines!,"I've just checked the Seventh Generation site, and this powdered laundry detergent is not for use in a high efficiency washing machine.Their liquid laundry detergent is okay for he machines.I ended up with four boxes of detergent that won't work for my machine."
5,Perfect curry seasoning,I was very unhappy when this curry powder was no longer available at our local groceries. It is the best tasting I've found. Just the right blend of flavors.
1,it is EXTREMELY slow!,you will be surprised to see how slow it is. It takes 1 minute going from one question to the next. your trend of thought will be interrupted and your precious time will be wasted waiting for the next question to show up
2,Good quality?,"I love these sunglasses but after two months the white on both sides is begining to fade. There are light browninsh streaks on the sides and it will not come off. I'm guessing all these marks are from the sun, that seems like bad quality to me."
3,"This ""Dictionary"" includes only ""A"" and ""B"" sections","I looked for this book while reading ""The Brother Gardeners"" by Andrea Wulf and the disclaimer explains it is a reproduction and has ""imperfections."" These aspects are charming and the book is filled with delightful detail.However, the description does not tell you that you are only buying the ""A"" and ""B"" sections of the dictionary-- very disappointing and odd."
2,I wanted to like this but I was disappointed,"I wanted to like this book because I believe in the connections between the dharma and radical politics. Unfortunately the book just wasn't written well enough to really get into these connections. I enjoyed his other book, Against the Stream, much more and do recommend that one for advice about useful socially engaged Buddhist practice. Dharma Punx, however, is sort of just a memoir about a generic, tortured and self-righteous punk rock boy, and most people probably won't relate to it; at least, I didn't. Do read his other book, and do read other relevant texts regarding socially engaged Buddhism, such as Thich Nhat Hahn's work."
4,"A good story, but nothing to do with Buddhism.","I enjoyed this book for its entertainment value as a memoir, but I was a little disappointed at the fact that it barely had anything to do with Buddhism. I had read Brad Warner's Harcore Zen and was expecting this to be similar, but it's not. This book is not about Buddhism, but about how religion saved Noah Levine from his harmful lifestyle. He might as well have ""found Jesus"" or something and the story would have been the same. It seems like he just got involved in the first religion to come along. I'm not trying to be critical, I thought it was a good book. It tells an interesting story, if that is what you're looking for, but if you are looking for any sort of Buddhist philosophy, look somewhere else."
3,"great condition, long wait","The book is in amazing condition which I'm very pleased with. However, it arrived almost 3 weeks after it was supposed to. I know it's just an eta, but it was still a bit long. Still fairly content though."
1,All ego. Poorly written.,"Was there even an editor on this book? I kept running into spelling errors and just poorly written passages.I had high hopes for this book, myself being a ""punk buddhist"", but I found this was just a story about Noah Levine. All he does is talk about himself over and over. I was so bored. I couldn't even finish it, half-way through I had to put it down.If you want to read an amazing book on punk and dharma, then you NEED to read Brad Warner's Hardcore Zen. I read this after my failed attempt at Dharma Punx and was blown away. Hardcore Zen is such an amazing book, it's on my top 5 list of most favorite books of all time.Sorry Noah."
1,difficult to finish,"appalling writing aside, this book is devoid of any spiritual understanding or any helpful life lessons. the judgement and self praise that is heavy in every chapter brings down what could have been a compelling story of recovery and service. i thought it would be interesting to read about the intersection of such different ideas (punk and buddhism) but quickly the book digresses into a story about how to act in each 'scene' (hardcore, straight core, skinheads, skater etc) and how much the author hates hippies because his parents identify with them. i struggled from beginning to end with this book, and only finished it by telling and retelling myself it is short and easy to read."
2,What is the Pali word for TOOL?,"There is no end to the stilted language, tedious details, and self-righteousness.Exhibit A- page 184""Disneyland is just another example of the American empire of lies and corrupt capitalist propaganda, so I felt alright about sneaking in....The rides were more intense than I had remembered; with my heightened mindulfness, it was an incredible experience, but not recommended for the weak or elderly.""What about height requirements on the Peter Pan ride? And park hours? Did you meet Mickey- that non-meditating, Capitalist Pig?"
2,A 'dorks' night of the soul,"This book is a journal/memoir, heavily laced with 12-step philosophy. If you are addicted to punk music, drugs, alcohol or Buddhism then the book is for you. I have titled my review ""A 'dorks' night of the soul"", because the book does not ultimately lead anywhere. I think the most uncomfortable aspect of the book is the author's comparison of Buddhism with Punk behaviour - as if his childish egocentrism, allowed to spiral out of control by parents who were themselves enraptured by their own self-absoption, was the manifestation of a spiritual drive comparable to the Buddha's.I'm sure he means well, and as I said, if you have an addictive personality then the book will probably be of help to you. But don't make the mistake of thinking there is any real spiritual guidance between the pages."
1,Not Good,"I got through 3/4 of this book. It was sitting on my shelf from when i bought it a few years ago and decided to give it a whirl. I really wanted to like it. This is a lame memoir. Want the story. I'm a punk, have a spiritual supportive father yet cause i'm such a punk i have to rebel against that, did drugs, got sober and found my way. There is nothing likeable or interesting about this dude at all. His insights are far from profound. Very amateur, this is my first review ever on amazon but i really didn't like it that much, i felt its my moral obligation to warn others."
3,Diary of a junkie punkie,"This book is cool for those new punks who want to know what it was like in ""Tha day"". So I'd actually rate it prety high for the whole day in the life of a punk genre. But I found Cometbus omini bus and nothing left more interesting to read on that subject. The name ""Dharma Punx"" eludes to a modern day ""Dharma Bums"" story. It realy isn't much more than a clevor name. Again, though I'd suggest this as a contender for the modern pop punk in training reading list. Weather your 13 and hanging out on telegraph ave, Clark and Belmont, LIttle 5 points, or St. Marks-- this should be added to a list including anything by aaron cometbus, American Skin, and get in the van. I noticed a freinds book ""Amped"" has been getting high reviews and shares a similar theme during a later time period, add that to you punk primer as well.Over all, this book is one of those trendy college town books you see people reading at the co-op. Probably will not change your life."
3,Reads like a journal,"An intriguing glimpse into the author's journey from destruction and addiction to spirituality, this book can be especially inspiring for those from punk backgrounds who may be finding cynicism and anger to be unfulfilling. That is, if you can overlook the plethora of typographical errors and questionable grammar (shame on the editors!). Otherwise a thoroughly interesting tale of one person's spiritual growth."
4,It's about time!,"I can't stress how much <PIG>'s music is so unique and one-of-a-kind. He is a pure musical genius and it is certainly apparent on this cd. Cleopatra re-released this with changed artwork. When I first saw this cd, it totally took me by surprise and freaked me out! The cover is so shocking and that's partly what <PIG> is all about. This cd makes NIN look like Ace of Base. The Fountain of Miracles, The Seven Veils, and Rope are all great industrail tunes. Black Mambo is so amazing and the horns add such a cool feel to this song. Symphony of the Devil is classic <PIG> and starts off slightly slow and then builds to a tremendous climax! I WAS a little let down that there were no female vocals on this album because I think that's a great contrast to Raymond's patented growl. This album is still so great though! Don't pass this one up. Don't even think about passing this hunk of lard by."
3,not as good as the others,"Despite the other reviews...I think this is Pig's worst album along with Praise The Lard...Watts didnt have his ground yet and the songs sounds funny in a bad way...like cheesy industro-crap. I loved Sinsation, Wrecked, and Genuine American Monster...get those b/c they are the best ones."
2,Bland,"Petula sings jazz! I have listened to this CD on a number of ocasions and the best I can say for it is, bland. Pet Clark is not a jazz singer and the CD is at best mediocere late 50's pop but jazz it aint."
4,I'm gonna go chill with..... with my dad,This one rocks! Cartman rules. Caution: displaying this figure might cause South Park fans to burst into random qutes from the TV. SCHWWWEEEET!
5,Fantastic book to keep kids entertained,I love this book! I use it all the time when I want to keep kids up to 6 years old busy. I have kids who visit who beg me to bring out the book to do the finger plays. I recommend it highly.
5,Ohh the sound.,"As with most short ram intakes on N/A vehicles. The sound this intake provides is awesome. The installation is pretty straight forward as long as you have a modicum of mechanical knowledge and can follow directions. Performance wise, the intake helps a bit but gains are less then claimed (I haven't dynoed it, but it doesnt ""feel"" much different). All in all, a great purchase, especially here for the money. I would buy this again in a heartbeat."
4,"Seachoice Complete Outrigger Kit, Black","This outrigger kit is good. The poles, themselves, seem to be just fine. The attachment package, including the glass rings, the outrigger clips, and line are just fine. The one problem I see with the unit is the holdersthat allow you to move the outriggers themselves --- the adjusting cuts that allow you to put the outriggers out should be cut so they are 90 degrees from the boat. The way they are cut probably only allows 70 degrees, and the result is that you don't get the full extension on the outriggers. I can live with it, but it would be much better at 90 degrees."
4,Poozies for yousies,"I have Infinite Blue(IB) and Raise Your Head(RYH)and RYH finds my cd player more. Any cd with Kate Rusby singing on it can't be bad, and these are no exception. You really need both of these anyway because IB has Neptune on it, which is a great song.Ma Plaid/Freya's Dances is also great, and is also on RYH. Another one I like is Come All Ye Lonely Lovers. If your reading this and don't know who Kate Rusby is get Hourglass asap, it is awesome. My pecking order would be: Hourglass (K Rusby), then Raise Your Head, then Infinite Blue, Sleepless and Lights. 10 by Kate Rusby is not out yet and is something of a compilation with a few live tunes."
2,Mediocre,"If poor graphics, poor gameplay, and more detail to movie sequences, (Which were equally poor) are what you are looking for, then this is the game for you. If you are a die hard fan of the movie, stay clear of this game for it will only disappoint."
3,Jewelry Roll,"This roll was smaller than I thought it would be. It is of decent construction, but considering the price, I think it could have been made out of better, higher quality materials."
4,Solid and inexpensive,As expected: solid inexpensive multipurpose pocket knive. It has all necessary tools including cork screw. It is excellent quality. Only shortcoming: non-locking blade.
2,Where's the Beef,"Although, I really only bought the needle nose pliers, I'm sure the quality of the other two aren't far behind. The quality of the steel alloy or whatever it is stinks. Not only wouldn't it grip the teeth disintegrated. I was very disappointed, since my favorite tool is an old pair of vise grips by a US manufacturer. When tools were tools. Two stars instead of one, because the tool barely performed."
3,I'm with the other guy...,The long nose set isn't worth anything more than a door stop after you use them for the first time. The teeth strip right off. The rest of the set works as it should after the teeth wear down to a point and don't wear any more. I suppose that the steel that Irwin used for the set is of less quality than I expected to get from them. I would suggest another brand for your Vise Grip needs.
3,Parts of it stuck with me.,"I bought this book because of an earlier reviewer's dismay at its ""ritual cannibalistic content"".While the novel is not nearly as lurid as I'd hoped, it's still a pretty decent read. Cynical, absurd; darkly humorous, though not really laugh-out-loud funny. The characters are believable. (No, not necessarily likeable.) Perhaps it drags--but so would, I imagine, a miserably hot Texas summer during which your entire life collapses in a pile around your ankles.I finished it and traded it for another book, but somehow it's back on my mind. Maybe I should have kept it around."
1,Dreadful,This has to be one of the worst books I ever read. I can't believe I made it through the whole thing. I didn't like any of the characters and I couldn't relate to anything in the story (even though I spend all my days sitting in a cubicle). By the time I got the the ridiculous ending I was beyond caring if anyone survived or not. Really a big waste of time.
1,Don't waste your time!,"A tender love relationship was not enough to redeem the ritual cannibalistic content that was so offensive it just made my skin crawl! Yuk, this was just a nasty book SO unworthy of your time!"
3,"Not entirely successful, but worth a look","The first 2/3 of the book had me hooked, but then I started fading and wondering why it didn't continue to please. The build-up is very well done -- excellent characterizations, strangely mysterious goings-on, a love relationship that is very satisfying -- but once the weirdness starts taking center stage, it's just not convincing to me, and I found myself counting pages with 80 left to go, wondering if the whole remainder of the book would be a slog. It pretty much was, with developments there being too predictable and at the same time overly descriptive (""how many pages left?""). The very end rewarded the time spent to finish the book, and I can't help but feel that maybe this would have been a better movie than a novel. Three stars for a mostly fun and satisfying read."
2,Cannot write over,"Purpose was to make corrections to checkbook register so it looked ""neat"" as well as correcting after-the-fact typos. Puts down a thick cover which does conceal writing underneath BUT absolutely cannot then write over, no matter what type of pen/ink used. Ended up having to attempt to pencil in corrections!"
3,Happy and not...,"I was very happy with this product at first but it dried out before I was able to use it all up, and yes, I did keep the cap on. I remember it was somewhat pricey, as well. I would recommend if you are using huge quantities quickly and do not have the chance to go to a store."
5,Functional & rugged indulgence,"I finally pulled the trigger on this luxury sport watch as my first Omega. I have to say it compares favorably with my Rolex Datejust and GMT-Master II. The clasp is definitely better.So far, the watch is 2.5 seconds fast over the course of 7 days. My Rolexes have never been as accurate -- this is surprising accuracy for any automatic."
3,Great price on solenoid,Great price on Hunter solenoid for irrigation valve. Shipped right away and installed with ease. I would buy this product again.
4,Best commentary of the ones I have tried,"This commentary, along with its Old Testament companion, are the most complete commentaries of the ones I have tried, which either don't have enough detail or are too intellectual in tone. I would give them 5 stars, but they don't have the verses in the text. It is my understanding though, that some of Zondervan's Bibles contain much of the commentary information found in these volumes."
2,A once-great baseball rivalry....,"that's been overly chronicled at this point. American sport's historically second greatest rivalry (and not by much) to Army-Navy football, was the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants. In it's day, it was akin to a gang rumble. When the two clubs abandoned New York for greener pastures (emphasis on ""green"") after the 1957 season, New York was never the same, and neither was baseball. Much of the history, tradition, fire and poetry was gone forever.The West coast version was more suburban, at-a-distance tauntingbetween Northern and Southern Californians: totally different and completely foreign to the spirit of the original rivalry.There's nothing really new here that hasn't been covered innumerous other histories. To paraphrase the widow of John McGrawwhen asked what the legendary manager would have thought about his beloved team moving to California: ""He would have turned over in his grave."""
1,Not worth the money,"Sorry folks, but I was bored to distraction. The narrator should have been OFF camera much, much, much more than he was. When on camera he swallowed about half of the picture. Several areas had VERY noisy, annoying backgrounds. Many places he took us to were only the site where a building USED to be. There's something else there now. Also very poorly done. One example: He said he would take us to the church where Dickens' parents were married, but we never see it. The docu starts out at the Dickens' Museum. We see the outside, but he never takes us inside. All in all, I paid too much for this DVD. If Amazon would take returns simply because of 'customer dislike', I'd send it back in a second."
2,Charles Dickens' London Part 1 - Life,"Wonderful idea presented by an informed scholar.The portrayal of London at the time of Dickens is as well illustrated and I lookedforward to Parts 2 and 3. However, had I known that the successive CDs would have been a repetition of part I would nothave bought them. I had to conclude that the all 3 were some form of cut and paste jobs and highlighted the laziness of the host -Tony Williams.The comments may be applied to parts 2 and 3 ."
4,"new packaging, same quality of product","I also use NOW coconut, rosehip seed, jojoba, grapeseed, & sweet almond oils (probably missing a few). This product meets my expectations. I have not tried it on food (I use coconut and olive oils for that) but it is great for skin and hair. I use it alternately with the aforementioned oils."
4,Great Skin Care,"I purchased this product to help with my dry, winter skin. It's amazing! Just a few drops moisturizes my skin and once it's rubbed in, it doesn't feel greasy. It has a very, very light nice scent. Once I've put it on I don't notice it at all. I put some in a spritz bottle and spray it on. I am a nursing mother and I like to use this in lieu of lotion on my chest so I don't have to worry about the chemicals in lotion finding it's way into my baby's food. I only gave this 4 stars due to the packaging. Amazon just threw it in a box without enough padding and the lid cracked (probably against the muffin pan it was packed with)and the shard of plastic punctured the safety seal allowing some to leak out and soak the corner of the box. If I was going to consume this product I would have sent it back, but it's fine for my purposes."
4,Nice product quality and price,The only reason for 4 not 5 stars is because I haven't tested shelf life yet. Will update in a few weeks. Recently made homemade lotion and lip balm and so far product meets all expectations.
5,I love this oil!,"Works great for skin and I even found a use for leather chairs!A great, light on the skin oil, however I think I still prefer olive oil on my eye lids."
2,packaging not good,"item was exactly as represented...but came folded and rolled in a ""smaller than should have been"" box... haven't put it on yet, am trying to flatten it out... will be getting with a friend who is in graphic design/vinyl business to see if I can still use it."
3,It helps somewhat...,"It catches some Mosquitos and makes a dent in there population. However, it is not enough to completely shield your yard/picnic from being bothered."
1,I'm embarrassed,"I've left this device operating for 4 days straight in what I consider mosquito country. I get bit constantly in my yard while I garden and have resorted to long sleeves and pants. In four days, I've ""controlled"" exactly 4 mosquitos, 2 moths, and 4-6 very small gnat-looking bugs. The device contains a blue LED and a fan similar to one in a PC. It's louder than I would tolerate my PC to be though. There is no pheromone. There's no CO2. Just a blue LED and a fan. I wouldn't consider this to be ""state-of-the-art."" I bought it because it looks the cutest and I was willing to take a chance. I paid the stupid tax on this one. Don't repeat my mistake."
5,Works great!,"I've used mine for several seasons. One year left it out all winter where it got rain and snowed on--and still it worked great the following summer. During torment season (e.g. summer) each time I open the drawer I find all kinds of: little wings, bug parts, etc. Can I tell that there Mosquito's parts? Nope. But, we are getting bit less. I wonder if the other people who don't like this thing have placed it correctly? One last thing, this thing will not just zap all the mosquitoes in your yard, but will slowly lower the population. Use it from Spring to Fall for best results."
1,allready dead mosquito catcher,Purchased 8/1. Motor burned up 8-22. Wasn't working as well (in terms of a mosquito free area) as the original we had for 2-3 years before it quit.
1,"Don't buy it... seriously, just don't","It's a joke. If it worked they wouldn't make it so the bugs get chopped up so you can't see the remains. If it really worked they would want you to see the tray full of them. I live near the WI river which has a very bad mosquito problem and it does nothing. Maybe it works down south but I doubt it. Just goes to show; its the marketing, not the product, that makes the money."
1,Pathetic,I've been running this machine for three weeks non-stop as the directions require. I live in Northern NJ where we've had a horrible mosquito season. I've caught noting but little white moths and a few flies. This thing is a joke and a waste of money.
1,"Don't Think So, I'm embarrassed too.","I agree with this review word for word ""I've left this device operating for 4 days straight in what I consider mosquito country. I get bit constantly in my yard while I garden and have resorted to long sleeves and pants. In four days, I've ""controlled"" exactly 4 mosquitos, 2 moths, and 4-6 very small gnat-looking bugs. The device contains a blue LED and a fan similar to one in a PC. It's louder than I would tolerate my PC to be though. There is no pheromone. There's no CO2. Just a blue LED and a fan. I wouldn't consider this to be ""state-of-the-art."" I bought it because it looks the cutest and I was willing to take a chance. I paid the stupid tax on this one. Don't repeat my mistake."""
5,Excelente lectura,"Buen embalaje y buen tiempo de envio.El libro era nuevo tal como se suponia. Tiene las paginas amarillas, pero es una edicion de 1990, se entiende. Con respecto a la historia, la recomiendo; es fresca, divertida, romantica y hasta reflexiba.Me diverti mucho leyendolo, es un buen libro."
4,Reluctant Romance,"Stephen St. Clair is a stiff-shirt. He comes up against Kit Mallory and finds he can't move her, so he must except her as she is.The funny thing is Kit finds Stephen loveable, and she's not the only one who can't see why.So we are lead into the funny rump that is Jinxed from the beginning.From the back of the book:'Their relationship began with a bang. Whoever said that playing with toys all day was child's play had never worked for Stephen ""the Iceman"" St. Clair.Kit knew he didn't approve of her as his toy company's new head of Testing and Research. (The head with only one other employee.) So she was ready for a chilly reception after the unfortunate explosion in the lab. But she wasn't ready for the bizarre chain of mishaps that proved she was jinxed.Just as she wasn't prepared for the storm of reaction that proved Stephen St.Clair was more like a volcano than an iceman when it came to dealing with her.'"
1,trouble,"I received this webcam and the first thing that happened when trying to get it to work on my Windows XP-operated computer was that I got a warning that the software was not windows-approved and might cause instability, now or in the future, in the operation of my computer. When I tried to call tech support of the seller, Computer Geeks, I was put on hold for a very long time, after which I was unceremoniously cut off. Being tenacious, I called again, was on hold again for a very long time, and finally got to talk to a support person, who told me just to go ahead and install the software anyway (?). After I did that (I may regret it in the near future), the webcam still doesn't work. This is way too much trouble!"
4,good but dated,"although this book is now very dated , been written in 1970, it is still a good book and worth having"
1,Don't waste your money,"This is a very flimsy machine. Notice it is shown with a 4 X 4 sheet of plywood. That is because it is just about useless with a full 4 X 8 sheets. It is not stable and the stand is made of the aluminum tubing that lawn chairs are made from. It didn't take long for it to give way. I had trouble getting it alinged and keeping it aligned. The saw dust falls on the bottom ledge where your material rests on and throws off alignment. The material roller wheels of other panel saws is a much better way to go. If you need a panel saw for work, buy a real one. If you are a hobbiest, save up for a real one because this was really a disappointment."
4,Panel Saw with Big Potential,The Panel Pro is easy to put together and acceptably easy to fine tune alignment. The ruler options are not optional in my book. The wheels are handy but add challenges when ripping thick boards. It is a backsaver for crosscutting and ripping panels while working alone. The narrow bed does put unneeded stress on you while ripping sheets longer than 6'. Optional 2' to 4' extentions would be nice but not available. You must build your own. They save all the extension options for their much pricier upper end models.
3,trouble with a accurate cut line,"Although the panel pro did cut the plywood the way in it showed in the video, from the first cut I was unable to get a accurate cut. I contacted the company by E-mail and disscussed this problem with them and they offered some hints as how to mark there product along the bottom to ensure the position of the blade cut.You have to ""peek"" over the top or arournd the side of the saw area and try to see your cut line.I feel some kind of sight glass to see the saw blade would be a marked improvement."
3,"Could have been better, poor ending","For the most part, a well-written and atmospheric mystery. But it plodded, and the ending, and the final reveal of who the murderer was, seemed forced and came out of the blue--- as if the author flipped a coin right before writing the final chapter to determine which character would be the criminal. Quite disappointing."
1,they are made in china,"I thought these were quality but even though irwin is an American compay, its says they are made in china on back of packaging, I used the 7wr and 10wr quick release and the teeth wore down the first time i used on each. Plus the quick release is garbage. Stick to original release and you wont find much difference. I would rate these as good as something you would find at harbor freight"
4,"Good PDA, acceptable phone","I've replaced my Nokia 6310i with this phone. It's not much larger than the Nokia, and can do sooo much more. I use it for everything from keeping shopping lists through web browsing to GPS navigation.As a PDA it functions great, and due to its tiny dimensions, you can have it with you all the time.The drawback is that as a phone it is average at best. The speaker isn't loud enough in some cases, the microphone is a bit weak (unless you use the included headset or a BT headset) and the software (from Microsoft) is very-very basic and has a bunch of small bugs. Some of the bugs are so obvious, in fact, that I can't believe any of the developers have ever actually tested the software before shipping it.So try the phone part before you buy and make sure you can live with the limitations. If you can, the versatility of the device will more than make up for the shortcomings as a phone."
1,moronic,"I'll sum this sorry piece of trash up in three phrases. The graphics make 'people' look like oversized chunks of throw-up,the point is to race across extremely crude versions of cities,and the game is just crapy period."
1,An unnecessary (and extremely aggravating) accessory,"Purchased this rear gate with my cart, only to find that a) you need two people (at least) to install the gate on the cart, and b) if you *do* somehow manage to get it installed (which I never did), you certainly won't want to remove it any time soon, thus completely defeating the ""folding"" aspect of the cart. I kept the cart (which I like precisely *because* it folds up so well), but returned the gate for a refund. Tipke really needs to invest some R&D monies into engineering a full rear gate that actually *works* with this cart (I have some ideas, if they're interested)."
4,Tipke Fold-it Cart,"Cart works very well. Great for light weight & folding capabilities. Only minus is the optional gate is rather ill fitting.For my uses, (camping, boating), I'm glad I purchased it and would again, though I wish the price was lower."
1,forty dollars!!!!!,"bust a groove is not a good game at all it looks like a crummy cartoon with corny characters all you do is shoot little colored balls and you get points, it is not a good game at all to spend forty dollars on.There is different modes of play but they are all stupid, before you buy a game check it to see if its cool, if not drop it and just walk away.But this game ,I mean dont even pick it up it's not worth it"
3,Good Guide but Full of Egregious Typos,"Good all-around guide, but the Michelin Green Guide to Vienna is more comprehensive (although without the hotel, restaurant and shopping listings). This one is a good one volume all-round guide, but it has stupid mistakes such as saying that Vienna's largest cemetary is the Karl-Marx-Hof (it's the Zentralfriedhof). The blue pages with practical advice are excellent as are the maps. Sometimes the tone is a bit snide which is more than a little off-putting.Enter at your own risk."
4,"Anurans and Squamates and Crocodylia! Oh, my!","This is easily the best herpetology text book out there. It is informative, yet not full of the boringness (if that's a word...) of many textbooks. You might say that it's...fun to read."
3,Better than nothing,"Not much to add to Steven Beasley's review, he said it all, but for me it was just good enough. I had a VHS copy from the early '90s taped off of cable that disappeared, and since I don't own a TV anymore, it was worth it to pick up this DVD to watch on my computer. Playmates is the prize here, easily my favorite Kay Kyser flick with amazing music. The picture quality is as Steven Beasley wrote, scratchy and unremastered, and I would add a bit watery and wavy, but it looks better than VHS to my eyes. The quality, packaging and DVD mastering are spartan, but having Playmates is better than having no Playmates, so to speak. Five stars for the movie, two stars for the DVD."
3,Nice swing music,"I bought this DVD because some reviewer wrote he liked Kay Kyser movies and that Playmates was his favorite. I was rather disappointed since I have seen My Favorite Spy, You'll Find Out, and Around the World many times and these were all better than the two shows on this disc.In Playmates John Barrymore overacted worse than I could imagine, but I suppose he was supposed to be a bad actor. Still, his explosive outbursts were irritating more than funny. The story line was thin but the music was good.I thought Swing Fever was better but still not as good as the other movies I mentioned in the first paragraph. Its main attraction is a good dose of 1940s swing music. Tommy Dorsey and Harry James had a cameo part, which was too bad because I wanted to see and hear more of them. Not much of a story here, but then it was all about the music."
1,"writing as a fan of the book: ""The Manuscript Found in Saragossa""","If you've read the book ""The Manuscript Found in Saragossa"" you know that it starts super strong then devolves into a boorish don quixote book 3 attempt of some kind. But the opening is so freaking strong its hard not to be impressed (and sadly disappointed when it loses steam).this movie just doesnt have visual or dramatic power thats worthy of the source material. If you dont believe me - just read the first third of ""Diary Found on the Road to Saragossa"" and you will realize how mediocre this film is. The book (the first third or so) is phenomenal 6 or 7 star classic material."
1,NOT WORKING PROPERLY,"Bought this product after reading the reviews. Got the items on time and installed it right away. No problem as easy as 123. We left the house by 6pm with nobody but the activated minialarm plus. after 30 minutes, the alarm contacted my cellphone number as per programmed. so I called back my house number/system (per user manual) to acknowledge that I got the alarm and turn off the auto contact, but Its a failure. every 15 minutes minialarm will call my cellphone. finally we got home at around 9pm, worrying that somebody could have entered the house. fortunately, nothing was missing. I tried to reconfigure the alarm but still it keeps on contacting that programmed number. per user manual, you can deactivate the auto dial by calling the number but i can't deactivate it. So I ended up returning the product before lossing my hair on my head."
3,Great Book,"Hi,I am working at Ilisa Language Instute in Costa Rica, San Jose and I want to say that this book helps us a lot to give our students helpfull information about getting around in Costa Rica. Thanks!"
2,A Selfish Opportunist not a leader,"I was mesmerized by Kunsler until he came to my university campus during the height of student protests in 1970. He pontificated and got students in an emotional uproar with no real message except to take over an administration. He weaved his words over and over so that he couldn't be accused of inciting a riot. He continued and continued on and on hoping the students would engage in anarchy. Instead, the crowd got tired and the emotions lost out to reason. He wanted to be in charge of a movement, but there was no real cause except for his self-aggrandizement. I never felt positive about him after that. I know he championed some causes, but underneath he did it for personal glory and profit not because he had deep convictions and that showed during his speech at my campus."
4,Healthy Sticky Rice,I started eating rice when I found out that it is very good for your kidneys. It is very difficult to cook. You need to keep a watch on the pot. I find it excellent with some cinnamon and a little stevia in the morning for breakfast. It is a simple carb so you do not want to eat too much of it. But it is a welcome change for breakfast.
2,"A Disappointment - The Book, Not the Treasures","A reprint of book published long years ago, no effort was made to upgrade the faded, worn appearance that overtook the original. The illustrations are in very anaemic black and white, yielding very little detail. The book earns its two stars based solely upon the text. When I ordered the volume, I intended it as a gift to celebrate our parish priest's 25th anniversary as pastor of our local church but it arrived too late for me to find a substitute and was an embarrassment to me."
1,clips are horrible,"Installing these was a nightmare. I had a hole saw which cut the perfect size in the sheetrock. Wiring was a breeze. But when you put the fixture up into the hole in the ceiling, the clips that are supposed to hold it in place, do not work. They pop right off, the locking mechanism is atrocious. The sheet rock puts too much pressure on the clip, and pops it right off. Yuo can try this yourself, before installing the fixture - a slight pressure with your finger will pop the clip. The instruction provided, do not match the fixture. They show you how to lock the clip, then push a screwdriver into a slot, and push the clip up, locking it permanently. The actual clip provided does not have anyplace to insert your screwdriver into. Total junk. I had to drill through the clip, and through the housing, to keep it in place. Made a 15 minute job take 2 hours."
1,Impossible Installation,"The wiring for these cans is easy, no complaints there.Getting the clips to work is a nightmare because the instructions are wrong. After fiddling for a couple of hours and searching for online help, I'm convinced these are just poorly designed and even more poorly documented.Basically, after searching, I found various ""experts"" that said installation was easy with pliers and a screwdriver. Basically, slide the cans up, push the bottom of the clip down with pliers, push the tops up until they snap, put the screwdriver on the bottom of the snap and hit it upward this time with the pliers and viola, easy installation! All this while you're trying to hold the can in the hole in the first place.There are WAY easier cans to install. Pass on these."
5,Wonderful,Piece of work. Will provide you with wonderful insight on how you may take a different perspective on your self analysis.
4,Hard core only need apply...,"This game is a great 'commander' game, ONCE you learn how to handle the interface efficiently. Very challenging to complete all the missions (and thus the game). graphics are not great, but this is about pitting the right units against the enemy at the correct time. each different unit has different strengths and weaknesses. Almost 50% is decided before the sides ever clash...knowing when to attack and when to play defensively is critical.Jay"
5,does this game work for ps3,does this game work on the ps3? I really loved this game when i had a ps1..i want to get back into it
1,THE WORST PLAYSTATION GAME I EVER PLAYED,"Don't waste your time renting or buying this game, It is truly terrible. The characters are impossible to control and the battles scences are beyond your control. This game has a neat theme, and could have be worth playing, but whoever made this game needs to go back to the designing board. It seems like this game was never test marketed, because if it had, then the programmers would have made major changes. It is the worst game I have ever played."
2,WARNING! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.,"If you are looking for a really good strategy video game on the Playstation console, look somewhere else. If you are looking to be bored in less than ten minutes, then this game is for you. With lack-luster graphics, simplistic gameplay, so-so sound, the only reason to come near this game is if you are a die-hard fan of the role playing board game."
5,30 YEARS AND STILL ROCKIN',"FOR ALL OF YOU BLACK OAK ARKANSAS FANS WHO GOT LOST THROUGHOUT THE YEARS, HAVE NO FEAR CAUSE JIM DANDY AND THE BOYS HAVE COME TO THE RESCUE AGAIN. THE MUSIC IS FRESH AND HAS ALOT OF PUNCH. INCLUDED ARE A FEW REMAKES OF OLDER FAVORITES WITH A NEW TWIST TO THEM. ALSO THERE ARE TWO SONGS BY THE LATE TOMMY BOLIN. BROTHER JOHNNY BOLIN DOES HIS BROTHER WELL IN THESE HAMMERING RENDITIONS. IT WAS ONCE SAID LONG AGO THAT WHEN IT CAME TO BLACK OAK ARKANSAS' MUSIC, YOU EITHER HATED THEM OR LOVED THEM. FOR ALL OF YOU CLASSIC SOUTHERN ROCK N ROLLERS,GIVE THIS CD A TRY. I THINK IF YOU ONCE HATED THIS BAND, THE ENERGY RECORDED ON THIS NEW RELEASE WILL CHANGE YOUR MIND AND REALIZE, AFTER 30 YEARS OF MUSIC MAKING, THEIR TIME IS NOW. GO JIM DANDY, GO!"
3,secret love....,"Synopsis: Though Eadie Webb's business is slowly but surely going under (she owns a small ranch), she relies on the extra cash she earns working for Hoyt Donovan. Only she has a secret: she's madly in love with him for the past five yrs! Then one day changes everything...and Hoyt reassesses his whole life. He wants a wife..some heirs..and he knows the perfect woman! Now his plan is to ask Eadie to plan a big white wedding for him...without her guessing that she's going to be the bride!I liked Eadie but overall I didn't enjoy the book. It was too one-sided, about how Eadie felt about Hoyt throughout the whole book but nothing about what Hoyt felt about Eadie... until the end few pages during the 'all out confession time'! I also feel that the gap of 5 yrs in between them (before Eadie & Hoyt declared their love to each other) was too long, considering they worked together and saw each other everyday. I've enjoyed S Fox books in the past but not this one."
4,Love and Marriage,"This is not one of Ms Fox's best. Most of her books twist your heart right out of your body.This one was too, I don't know every day.Eadie Webb is in love with Holt Donovan, he has to get into a bad accident before he realizes he is attracted to Eadie.But when he does he goes after her.This book was slow, and I am too spoiled by the other Susan Fox books.But be sure you get the Susan Fox that isn't about rats, mice or lesbians."
2,Not What I Thought It Would Be,"After having read Susan Fox's Contract Bride and The Marriage Command, I expected this book to be just as amazing. I was seriously disappointed. The book wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. If you want to catch up with Leah and Reese from Contract Bride buy this book."
2,A little dull,"This really isn't what I've come to expect from Susan Fox. Her books are usually enough to get the tears going. This one was pretty dull. Fairly early on, they get married, and then... well, not much else happens. There's no conflict, not even a nasty ex-girlfriend showing up!"
5,Character is Destiny !!!,"This is a fantastic book. The gentle giant in this book is clearly Gary Phelan. The way he and his client stayed on ""the high road"" distinguishes them from all the money grubbing attorneys who had signs around their neck which read ""I am for sale!"" While the other attorneys sold their clients down the river, Gary Phelan has remained true to the mission of standing for the injustices his client has suffered. Followed this guy in many successful precedent setting cases in the Wall Street Journal. A force to be reckoned with, and a study in character! This book should be read by all women who wonder if they are on a level playing field in the workplace."
1,More Feminist Hypocrisy,"Too bad Antilla doesn't have a clue that it is **humans**, en toto, that do evil, not just men. Typical shallow, reductionist thinking that passes muster simply because the politically correct world has no ability to distinguish between truth and error.Hey, Ms. Antilla... I as a victim of the feminist oppressors in my own career, how about putting a few of my stories about insane, vile, bitter, nasty - and yes, SEXIST - women in your next book?Nah, I didn't think you would..."
4,Keep Customers for Life,"I found this book to be really helpful because it is full of practical, common-sense ideas to help any business owner attract and keep loyal customers. Brad Sugars explains how to assemble effective newsletters, write ""killer"" headlines on ads, generate powerful offers, conduct effective ""closed-door"" sales, and how to move your prospects up your ""ladder of loyalty"" so that they become your Raving Fans. He also covers in detail the 6 steps to creating a successful loyalty strategy."
3,Rhinestones fall out!,"Although I loved these glasses at first and got tons of compliments on them, a rhinestone fell out within 5 weeks. The warranty was for 30 days so Dr. Tavel refused to fix them for free!!!"
5,Harry Belafonte IS the Man,Harry Belafonte's such a great performer and human being. His unique voice and tender delivery is very touching and moving. This is a great concert.
4,Live Rare Concert Performance,"Taped in Centennial Concert Hall in Winnipeg, Canada between the 3rd and 5th July 1985. Great tuba player."
4,Characters can be fallible,"I agree much more with the 5-star reviewer than with Persad. Hasn't he ever heard of fallible characters? The narrator is abolutely self-centered, selfish, narrow-minded, and many other things, but she is in many ways a keen observer of the horrific events she moves through. Personally I found it interesting to read about the Liberation through the eyes of this character rather than via some omniscient narrator or distant historian. I find Moravia's unadorned prose attractive and sophisticated. A good book and two very interesting and REAL female characters."
1,Faulty Product,Faulty Product died after only 12 hours of use.. Was left in the cold and dark during a ice storm that left power out for daysss... Northern Tool refused at first to do a exchange they said all generator sales are finally during a disaster.. so they sell defective items and dont guarantee them.. after much arguing they finally switched it out with another generator which costed more didnt so much as do a discount and product was same watts.. this was my first and last time buying anything with Northern Tools... If you dont want to lose 700.00 dollars dont buy this generator from Northern Tools they wont guarantee it .. Comes to find out they don't Guarantee any of their generators so if you end up with a defective generator your out how ever much you paid.. Thanks Allison
2,Nothing to get excited over,"This is a basic multi tool designed for people who need wire cutters. The screwdrivers are adequate, but do not have the greatest bevel. The black plastic in the handles will come off eventually. Also this tool (and the larger Legend 800) do not have a can opener. I own one of these and it is in the bottom of my tackle box....at least I think it's still there."
5,hot tub filters,"exactly as advertised,looks the same as original ones from hot springs tub, but at 1/2 the cost. very satisfied, would buy again."
5,Just fine,"good price, fits my spa and I need five of them all the time, so I buy a new one here and there and replace the older ones"
2,Not very effective..............you get what you pay for.,"I purchased these for my HotSprings spa ( being sure to get the right ones for the spa model) after reading some of the reviews which said that they worked very well.That is not true.These filters do NOT get the water as crystal clear as the factory filters do. The water remains vaguely milky.After several months of use I have even resorted to removing the permanent plastic straps around each one in hopes that they would filter better.Now I will order the proper filters for my spa and stop trying to find a cheaper alternative.These just do not do the job.Save your money for a proper set of filters, ones recommended by your manufacturer."
1,may not work in hot springs spa,"This was the second time I had purchased these for our hot springs sovereign spa. The first set was fine. After the second set was installed our spa would go into shutdown mode. I had a service appointment scheduled and the service man asked me to try taking the filters out and then the spa worked fine. We are purchasing brand name filters from now on, not worth the risk of not working."
4,Funny,"This EP is like any thing Insane Clown Posse did. It has funny elements, and not so funny elements. I will say I am in a small minority of fans when I say I dont like every thing they did. This EP Has two of my favorite ICP songs on it ""Cotton Candy"" and ""Super Balls"". These two songs are some of the best ICP ever did(not the only). But I also think that ICP should have done more funny songs than serious songs(if any thing they did could be called serious). But Picking this one up used for cheep is a must for any fan, raging or not."
2,Leaky in no time,"On the day it arrived it was packaged with other items. It took me a while to figure out what leaked on the other items.Got some of the colored oils on my clothes, but quick action on my part may have prevented permanent stains.Ended up not being fun at all. It's too bad because the concept was fun.Maybe higher controls and standards should be used in producing this itemdisappointed :(J Weakland"
2,Incredible idea - POOR DESIGN,"I cannot believe how flimsy this product is. The blue gel pads slide all over the place because they don't attach in any real way. The suction cups don't hold. The blue ""seat"" falls out as I sit on it and lean forward. Come on! I only weight 110 lbs! I've been using this for a weak and now I'm considering getting rid of it altogether because I spend more time trying to fix the pads and the seat than I do enjoying my daughter's bath time."
2,"Helps the back, but doesn't stay together.","This product does save your back as you are bathing your infant, but the parts won't stay on. The gel pads that cushion your arms and knees won't stay on. They are supposed to ""hook"" on to these little slits in the base, but they don't stay. Also, when storing this product you just fold it in half, but the seat comes out."
4,Love the seat,"The seat portion has done wonders for my back and it's great to have the padding for my knees, but it's irritating that the pads aren't attached and they continue to move. My daughter also likes to grab up the pads for the elbows. Overall if you can deal with these minor things, than it's great for posture, knees, and back."
5,Helping the Stars,"This game sounds awsome, but some people forgot to give the game any stars, so I'm giving the stars that they forgot to give."
4,A Classic (but short) Gaming Adventure!,"A lot of sub-par games have come out over the past few years. It can take some time to sift through the bad ones until you finally find a great title worth playing.This, my friends, is one of those great titles.A fun, well-written, creative action/adventure game, Beyond Good & Evil is simply one of those titles that every gamer needs to own. With an amazing stealth system, simple-yet-deep combat controls, beautiful graphics and sound (oh the sound!), and an easy-to-navigate interface, this game is nothing short of top-notch.The only negative aspect of this game is that it's far too short. Any seasoned gamer can finish it in anywhere from 10-15 hours. The ending is abrupt, and since a sequel was never made, you might feel a bit stranded when you are done.Despite that, however, this game is still worth the price tag. I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a fresh, original, and fun action/adventure title."
4,My first Flora Speer book,"I thought the book was interesting, and I liked the surprise ending with her 'best friend'. No wonder the author never aluded to her 'best friend' as being male or female ... we just assume female ...Anyway, I did think, like the other reviewer, that she did an awful lot of snooping, however, he could never seem to be honest & upfront with her about anything in regards to his past. I kept thinking, he will run out of patience with her, and at the end, we see just how badly he did want her to know the truth.I liked the whole book, but especially the ending. I was very happy for both the primary & the secondary characters.I will read another Flora Speer book again."
4,tasty,"I used this as a pasta sauce and it was pretty good. I would not buy it regularly because it is a bit pricey, but it made a quick and easy birthday lunch for my little (45 year old) brother. He liked it a lot."
3,Glamoury: Magic of the Celtic Green World,"Overall, this book gives a decent accounting of Celtic myths and Deities. However, since it pushes a four directional ritual, it is really nothing more than a highly Celtified version of Wicca. There is nothing wrong with Wicca per se, but it is not what the ancient Celts practiced. What is known as Wicca today was developed in the 1950's by Gerald Gardner. Despite this misleading four directional approach, the author has come up with some good material. But it should be remembered that the rituals are not strictly Celtic and reflect modern Wiccan practice. The good information on the stories and figures of Celtic religion is what makes me give this 3 stars. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother with it. It is not traditionally Celtic."
2,Not a favourite,"While information is thorough and sound, I found it rather interesting that Mr. Blamires had nothing good to say about any of the female deities. I am not a dianic or feminist witch - I worship both the Goddess and the God. However, I was slightly offended at the way in which he treated the Goddess in this book. Perhaps Mr. Blamires did not mean it to come across that way, but his book is the least favourite in my library. There is nothing in this book that you cannot find in another book dealing with celtic culture, religion and magick."
3,Ok for research.,"This is a great book for research. The myths and origins of the Celts are represented nicely. I don't, however, recommend this book if you are looking for Spells or Rituals."
1,Very Disappointed!,"I ordered (or thought I was ordering) this product used from an Amazon.com distributor. The product that I received was for ""Middle School"" and contained all subject areas, for middle school!!!When I contacted the distributor, they said they didn't have the product that was advertised, but did have the cds for a later version (2001), and asked me to send the Middle School set back, so that they would replace them with the 2001 High School Math version! I sent the cds, as per their request back in July! It is now August, and I still haven't received the so-called later High School Math version."
1,Wish it lasted more than 3 months,I loved the idea of this sprayer and my original last 1 1/2 years. When it stopped holding pressure my husband tried to fix it but eventually had to buy me a new one. That was in May. It is now late August and the new sprayer has ceased working! I don't want to pay $60+ each year to spray my weeds. I wish it were made better because I like using it.
1,Not worth it,"You have to push it about 80 feet to get any kind of pressure, and that's only good for about 10 seconds worth of spraying, then you need to push it 80 feet again. The wheels are made of hard plastic that doesnt grip, so they simply slide across dirt or cement without turning. Used mine once and gave it away."
1,MY sprayer arrived broken,"I am sorry, but received this item broken. I called customer serice but my 30 days had run out 3 days ago. I am sure it was probably insured if you can get someone to talk to."
1,Piece of junk,"I bought this last summer to replace a worn-out sprayer, but didn't have a reason to use it until today. I pulled it out of the box, read the directions, and filled it with Round-up. But it would not pressurize. Finally, I got it to spritz a little, and then after a while if I pushed it on the sidewalk for a long time it would pressure up enough to create a spray, but it only lasted long enough to spray a swath of 1 x 6 FEET. I fought with this thing for almost two hours and managed to spray all of 1/2 gallon, and then it just stopped working completely! Then, of course, I had to find something to put 1.5 gallons of mixed herbicide into. Complete junk. It is going back tomorrow."
4,Works for me!,"I bought one of these several years ago to spray Round-Up. It's still working fine even though I've never cleaned it; I just refill and use it each year. It is REALLY nice not to have to pump and pump and pump! The nozzle doesn't put out a lot now, but it could just be partially clogged (I should try to clean it maybe?!). Right now, I'm trying to get one for my Dad (93 years old and spraying his fruit trees every 10 days and complaining that his pump sprayer makes his shoulder hurt). None of the stores around here carry it any more, so I'll have to get it online, hoping the new ones are as good as the one I have. Not a sure thing now-a-days!"
2,Consider it a disposable sprayer,"I bought this sprayer last spring; it worked OK along the drivewayor anywhere else I kept it constantly in motion. The pressure quicklydissipates if it is stationary - there is a pressurized quart-sizedcontainer within the larger body of the unit; that is the only partpressurized, and as such it cannot keep pressurized for more than15-30 seconds when stationary (depending on flow).Well I went to use it today and ... it is totally inoperative. It didnot survive winter storage, in a semi-heated garage, totally drained ofliquid.At least I got 3-4 rounds of use out of it; all in all I sprayed maybe20 gallons of week killer before it died."
1,Great idea if it only worked ...,"Worked first time. When I refilled it, would not spray. Returned for refund but after 2 months it has yet to be credited. I wish it would have worked because it would have saved a lot of time."
2,Good for One Season,"When I first saw this advertised, I thought it would be great. Living in a rural area, I have fencing, an unpaved driveway, and other areas that need to be sprayed. I'm a senior citizen, and the hand-pump sprayers just were too slow; I'd run out of energy. But this wheel-pump. . . ! I found I could hook it onto the back of my garden tractor and drive along, spraying as I went. At the time, I thought it one of the best things I'd ever bought. That changed the second season, however, when it refused to hold any pressure at all. I emailed the company and was told to clean out the filter at the bottom. I found the filter, which looked fine, but I rinsed it anyway. No change: the thing would simply not hold pressure. I filled it with water, thinking perhaps moisture might revive some rubber seal or something. Still no change. Regretfully, I put it out along the road, and a passing motorist must've stopped and picked it up. It was such a great idea. A+ for imagination; F for execution."
1,Gilmour Spray a disaster,"I was excited after reading the write-up on the Gilmour Spray as I felt it would suite my needs. The purpose was to spray weeds on my lawn. I was very disappointed. I carefully followed the instruction to make sure it meets my needs. The things I was looking for was spray distance and spray pattern i.e width of the spray as well as the consistency. Unfortunately none of these conditions were met. The spray distance was about 4 feet initially, which lasted for a few minutes and then dropped off to about a foot without any consistency. The whole episode was very frustrating, and after about 45 minutes to one hour decided that this would not suite my needs. I called the manufacturer directly but they were not helpful. That was when I decided to get in touch with Amazon.com. I would not recommend this devise to anyone"
1,Service Plan Never Received!!!,"I have never received any correspondence from this company. They were supposed to send the service plan within 2-3 weeks after I received the television. However, as I stated - I never received the plan!!"
2,Delay in shipment of paperwork,"Although I have not had the need to use the warranty, the vendor was asked on 3 different occassions to send the contract. This was also noted in another review that I read."
2,"Camel Makers, more like snooze makers","I was fairly disappointed with this book about teaming. I think the scripting was too long and not useful, and the commentary was although helpful at times, more like ramblings of a lecture than an introspective look into the how tos and whys. I do not reccommend this book unless you are looking for something very dry and painful."
5,Great for anyone that loves whales,"I have always had an interest in whales since I was 8, but never followed that dream. I found this books to be both enjoyable, and informative. Anyone who enjoys learning about these beautiful creatures will enjoy this book."
4,"Common sense, but not very commonly used - it's a good read!","The ""Ten Commandments of Success"" is packed with practical, bite size morsels of the principles of success. Throw in the Ten Commandments, and it sounds like a basic premise for a book on success. However, the distinct power is his ability to communicate the value of building successful leadership that simultaneously builds heart in an organization while leaving a legacy. There's lots of common sense wisdom in the ""Ten Commandments of Success,"" that I'm sure you'll find is prevalent in ALL successful individuals at some degree; especially the value of continuing to learn and treating others well. Though I listened to this one only once, it made such a positive impact on me, that I desire to revisit it a few more times and continue to ""be a student."""
5,Love the Series and Douglass,"I love how this series ties in the story with actual history. I would also recommend reading Douglass's other books like the Wayfarer Redemption series, Darkglass Mountain books, and Threshold. I'm looking forward to reading more of her books because I love them all. You really fall in love with her characters and feel for them when things don't go as planned. I also think that her stories move fast. There are other books that I like but I don't love because the stories drag on in some parts and I don't feel this way about any Douglass books. I love them all!"
2,Loved Hades Daughter. . . this one. . not so much.,"I'm not very far into it. . . but I'm confused. I thought this book was a sequel to ""the Troy Game"" but so far it doesn't seem connected at all. Hades Daughter was slow moving at first but got much better, was disoppointed in the ending. Wish this one would grab me like that one did."
5,"A Cuban Masterpiece from Adalberto Alvarez ""el sonero""",I have been listening to Adalberto Alvarez since I was born. He's a complete musician and this album has his best songs.Including Homenaje a Matamoros which is a mix of his best songs. I hope you enjoy it
3,"Healthy, but wierd tasting","I can see why many people will like these. I personally didn't like the taste. They are very healthy, and I eat their wintermint variety every day, but this variety is strange... Anyway, Whole Foods Market carries them for about the same price, so you can try a single pack before you buy a case."
2,Poor design,"This is Gerber's take at creating a CRKT KISS type knife, which is a minimilized folder. They blatantly copy Ed Haligan's design. You would think they could have made it more ergonomic. After a short session of use, one's hand gets extremely fatigued. The blade, which is too small to take advantage of it's half-serrated profile. It gives you the worst of both worlds. The serrations, as well as being possibly some of the least agressive ever, are too small to adequately cut even string. The tiny unserrated part of the blade has no belly, forcing the user to use only the tip, which eventually becomes worn and rounded. The blade is also made of 400 series stainless steel,which is mediocre at best, taking a decent edge quicly but loosing it just as fast. The lock is prone to failing under a heavy grip. It seems that if you want this type of knife, you should get the real thing."
2,Crap,"the grave aint no place for a psycho thug killer, neither is my cd player. This guy makes a gimmick of being gangster rap, but with thrashing guitars hes not fooling anybody. He's got nice flow but his voice is terrible, you can barely understand the guy, he sounds like hes rapping with a mouth full of food or something. Every track has a rock chorus taking away from the ""gangsta"" image. every single track either has Violent J or Madrox in it. which makes it even worst. with an exeption of 2 or 3 tracks, this cd is weak."

3,Informative reading.,"This book has good information for those with minor credit problems. It also has info on file segregration, which is only useful if credit applications do not ask if you had previous credit problems. Disappointingly, for anyone who has a bankruptcy, this book does not provide information on how to re-establish your credit with what I consider to be 'straightforward' means."
1,Illegal practices,"Hiding Bad Credit Is Illegal.Some credit repair schemes promise you that they can ""hide"" bad credit by helping you to establish a new credit identity. If you pay a fee for such a service, the company may direct you to apply for an Employer Identification Number (EIN) from the Internal Revenue Service, and to use the EIN in place of your social security number when you apply for credit. You may also be instructed to use a new mailing address. This practice, known as file segregation, is a federal crime."
2,Tholian Web + Turnabout Intruder + Spock's Brain,"The title sums up this book. It is a mixture of three episodes and as presents a little deja vu to the reader.Unfortunately, the story has not suspense because the reader knows what is happening as soon as the landing party beams onboard the Enterprise (TM, SM, (c), etc). When you have nothing suspenseful or no surprises to wait for one starts to pay more attention to nit-picking, and here are some that annoyed me.1. Apparently, the ship has a photographer who uses film plates. Maybe the ship was actually the Love Boat....2. Sentient beings are categorized as such by whether they have farms.3. Mr. Scott has a southern accent when agitated.There are more, but they would spoil the story. The point is, the story isn't horrible it just is a bit boring and predictable.Try some New Frontier novels instead."

4,AK1200 - Prepair for Assalt,Another good CD from AK....never letting us down with an assortment of good jungle...from jump-up to hardsept...he keeps the party going..even if it is my car. I definatly suggest purchasing this one for your collection.
2,Listening to this embarasses me.,"Lackluster drum & bass without any driving force behind it. What a disappointment. This mix never picks up, and the sound qual is for the birds. At a time when we need good American D&B DJs the most, It pisses me off that we pay so much attention to crap like this. If you want to support a better American DJ without diving too underground get Dieselboy's THE SIXTH SESSION. Above and beyond that, check out Stakka + Skynet, TEE BEE, RAM Trilogy, and anything on METRO or BC RECORDINGS. DON'T SETTLE FOR THIS SORRY REPRESENTATION OF D'n'B!"
1,I can't believe this made it so far,"I am from Central Florida and I have been subjected to AK 1200's cheesy jump up for way too long and it pisses me off that I ran across this DJ.I wouldn't be so harsh if he just stuck to spinning acid jazz and trip hop-- that is what he is good at. And once again, this cd dissapointed me like all his supposed ""drum and bass"" Cd's."
3,Good content. Poor recording.,"This book addresses (rightfully) perhaps the most effective means of marketing possible - word of mouth. While certainly not exhaustive there are ideas here that can be applied in every business though it does have a slight bent toward political advertising. If you are a reader, get the book NOT the tape. Besides being abridged, the tape is the worst recording of any tape I have. (and I own over 900 audiocassettes) Perhaps my recording was a fluke but I would have rated this higher were it not for the poor recording quality that made it so difficult to listen to."

2,"Poor quality, lasts one season","This is my second review, for my second purchase of these sprayers. The first sprayer did not spray the following spring, even though it was drained and stored in a semi-heated garage. I was disappointed but I did find the sprayer useful, so I got another one in the spring of 2010. Well today, April 23 2011, I took it out for the first use of the year. Just like last year, it does not work at all. I disassembled it, cleaned all the parts, reassembled it, and it just wont work. This is a one-season sprayer. I cannot recommend this product. Also the hose is far shorter than the product description, as others have noted."
3,CHEMICAL SPRAYER,I found you have to roll the unit more than 80 ft to get the pressure up.And what I mean is the unit looses pressure quickly. I don't think I would recommend this sprayer.
4,sprayer on wheels,i have various types of sprayers in my barn and don't like any of them; especially the backpack style. This sprayer on wheels is the greatest. Whoever thought of this must have felt the same way i did with the others. i have only used it twice and it is worth the money. it doesn't stay pressured as long as i would like BUT i don't have alot of walking. I just walk thru the yard a few times and go back to spraying. The exercise won't hurt anyone. i do recommend the sprayer for someone like me that can't pump the other sprayers to a maximum pressure and can't carry around those other heavy sprayers.
3,Gilmour Wheel Pump Sprayer,"The sprayer is a great idea; however, if large areas need to be sprayed, it is hard to keep sprayer pressure up. The sprayer wheels have to be kept moving.The sprayer would work great for small spot spraying here and there with lots of walking in between sprays."
3,Gilmour Spray Doc Wheel Pump 4-Gallon Sprayer,Delivery was prompt. Arrived in good condition. Too good to be true. Full pressure doesn't even last a minute. I had to constantly wheel the sprayer to get even a weak spray to come out. I'm disappointed. I'm going back to my 2-gallon hand pump sprayer.
1,"Pressure problem, get's clogged up after a year","I would not recommend anyone to buy this. It was handy that you have 4 gallons available. Pressure was a problem. Following year did not spray well even after cleaning, although there was no way to clean the passageways."
1,"No volume, weak spray, terrible.",This product is not a pressurized 4 gallon sprayer. It works on a small pump (about 16 ounces) inside that quickly uses up its contents. Volume at sprayer is mininal compared to a pump up sprayer. It took forever to use up 4 gallons of product. At your store check the tiny orifice on the sprayer head compared to a pressure sprayer for a comparison how this will work. Used twice threw it in the garbage.
3,Great sprayer for big properties,If you need to walk a great deal to spray all the plants on your property then you might find this product helpful in a sense that you don't have to carry the container with your hand or on your back. But you need to walk a lot to make sure that there is enough pressure in the sprayer otherwise you will run out of it before long. The wand that comes wiht the Gilmour Sprayer W4 is nothing to impress!! I will have to buy another wand with extension in other to reach areas that I was able to before with my hand sprayer. It's a bummer to make another expense and pay again for shipping... Overall I am satisfied besides what is mentioned above.
5,Loads of Flowers,This product is great for watering large numbers of flowers spread all over our 2 acres. I fill it (sometimes add Miracle Grow plant food) and roll away. My husband cut the tip off for me so I could get more water to the plants faster.
4,Met my needs,"I've owned this sprayer for a month, and so far I'm happy with it. I was looking for a 3-4 gallon sprayer that I didn't have to lug around on my back. We have ten wooded acres, and I primarily use the sprayer to spray the knapweed that grows along the driveway and around the house. I have to say that I would not recommend this sprayer to someone who has a fairly small area to spray. Because the pressure builds as you walk along the ground, you would have difficuly keeping it pressurized while working in a small space. The hose length is fine for me, but I should have bought the telescoping wand. I am 5'9"" tall and the wand that comes with the sprayer is not long enough for me to spray close to the ground without bending over. The sprayer appears to be well made. We'll see if it holds up over the long run."
4,Great idea crippled by accounting,"I just used my new Gilmour Spray Doc Wheel Pump Sprayer, the self pumping feature is great. Pull it along a little, and pressure builds up. It does not have a way to disengage the pump, but there is a pressure relief valve to prevent problems. However it has a serious flaw - the sprayer hose is too short, by about 6-12 inches; I had to keep my arm in an uncomfortable position to prevent constant tugging on the hose. My guess is an accountant who never gardens found a way to save $0.15 and ruined a perfect product. I believe the taller you are (I am 6') the more noticeable this is, and perhaps a shorter person won't find this to be a problem at all. It is a real work saver, but I will have to find a way to lengthen the hose to make it a pleasure to use."
2,Needs more pressure,"This seemed to be a well built machine but it had a lack of lasting pressure. wheeling it all the way across the yard, we couldnt even finish spraying one bush. We ended up sending it back."
4,This sprayer is good for most gardening jobs.,I'm a rose gardener with 75 rose bushes and I spray very often. Thissprayer is ok. It doesn't have a lot of spray pressure so it takes melonger to do my gardens. You have to keep moving it to keep the pressureat a maximum. So instead of pumping a hand sprayer you have to keeprolling this one back and forth. It's easy to work with - easy to roll -cleans up well - and seems very well made.
4,"Very convenient, BUT",What do I do now that it does not get any pressure when I roll it. Can't seem to get any help from the Gilmour site.
2,4-gallon Wheel Pump Sprayer,"This sprayer is so easy to use. With my old sprayers, I had to stop often to pump them up; and the weight of carrying the sprayer--even with the shoulder strap--caused weariness. This new self-pumping sprayer is great. I can pull it along and spray without stopping."
4,Weak link,"I thought the Wheel Pump Sprayer was the best thing since . . .? Purchased one for home and have two at work. Being a 6ft.-plus guy, I also purchased telescoping wand. That presented the first problem. It breaks where plastic meets plastic. Secondly the wheels stop producing the pressure takes to make it spray. Spray Doc is very generous in sending new replacement parts at no charge ~ and with no instructions on how to install. Replacing the wheels was a nightmare.Right now my prayer generates no pressure to allow RoundUp to spray onto weeks. Major frustration!"
1,Gilmour W4 Spray Pump - 4 gal.,This pump does not work for me. It would only work for someone that has very few weeds that are spaced quite far apart so that you could continuously walk a ways so that the pump stays pressurized. I used this pump several times and find it to be very unworthy. I would not recommend this sprayer to anyone who wants to do some serious spraying.
4,Haven't used ist yet,I would love to rate this item but haven't had a chance to use it yet being we were in a drought last year.It looks good and I can't wait to use it because my backpack sprayer is beating the hell outa' me.
1,Spray pump,"I thought it would be cool not to have to pump a sprayer. That is why I bought the two wheeled sprayer. I tried it out and found it did not work out for me. It seemed to run out of air to fast.But I tried it out and sent it back.Thank you, Eddie"
2,Like fireworks one bang then poof,I bought this to use on my property on fence lines and such . Worked great for first year then poof!!! Doesn't want to roll or pressure doesn't stay have to keep rolling back and forth. I am a short woman but not comfortable all. Rinsed out replaced seals and serviced several times. More work and maintenance than I want!!! WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!!!
4,Terriffic Sprayer,"I really like this item, especially the fact that you don't have to hand pump it or carry it around. It holds 4 gallons which is another plus, you're not having to refill it all the time as with a smaller sprayer. I did have a problem with it not pressurizing once but it turned out to be because I missed cleaning out the plug thing. The only thing I would like to see added to this sprayer is some sort of stirring or mixing mechanism to keep your sprays from settling.I don't regret buying this one in the least, and it qualified for free shipping also, which didn't hurt any :)"
3,Ladys sprayer,"I purchased this product because I cannot handle a pump sprayer because I already had neck surgery. This sprayer was wonderful until I started having problems with it. Mine is about 2 years old and it stop spraying like it first did, called the company because it is life time warranty and they mail me a part, trying to attach that part, broke another part, they then sent me that part, got it all together but still does not work like the day i purchased it."
1,Would have been nice if it worked,Gilmour Spray Doc Wheel Pump 4-Gallon Sprayer #W4The sprayer had to be returned because it was defective. The nozzle had such a tiny opening that the merest spray came out of it. The wheels were very stiff and hard to move on the grass.
4,No more lugging the sprayer around,"Overall like the sprayer. Be sure to secure the top on the tank before pulling on the handle (mine wasn't secured and spilled chemicals all over the driveway). Wheels don't always turn easily, so had to drag it a bit; however, compared to carrying around my previous metal 3-gal sprayer, this was a breeze to use. I would recommend this product."
1,"BE PREPARED TO ""ROCK & ROLL"" THIS JUNK PUMP!","I NEVER NOTICED TILL THIS PUMP ARRIVED BUT IT HAS NO HAND-PUMPING MECHANISM. YOU MUST PUSH THIS CONTRAPTION BACK & FORTH CONSTANTLY TO KEEP IT PRESSURIZED. THE INSTRUCTIONS EVEN SAY TO PUSH IT 80 FEET BEFORE YOU START USING IT!! TANK PRESSURE ALSO DROPS OFF RAPIDLY SO BE PREPARED TO CONTINUOUSLY PUSH IT LIKE A BABY CARRIAGE, BACK & FORTH, AS YOU SPRAY WEEDS. GEEZ. WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK. I THREW MINE AWAY. I WOULD HAVE RET'D IT BUT FOOLISHLY THREW THE BOX AWAY."
2,Not very Happy with My sprayer,"I purchashed the Gilmour weed sprayer on Wheels. I have tried to use it 3 times. As I read the other reviews and felt it was worth a try. As one person stated the wand is about 6 "" short even if yout 5' 6"" you still have to bend over . This causes back pain. The spray should be labled a dribble nozzle. I could not get it to SPRAY right. The pressure is suppose to build as you move the sprayer either by pushing or pulling. Well after walking back and forth about 100 ft or more it only sprayed --or dribbled for a few seconds then back to rolling. I have emailed the company but no response. Its been 5 days and I am very dissapointed as I am in need of this item and it could just be a minor part problem --maybe faulty lid so as it won't hold pressure--or something left out I don't know I just want it to work as it is stated. glenna"
3,"good idea, clogs easily","Good idea. Rugged construction. Hose could be longer. Clogs too easily and when it clogs, there's no way to unclog it without spilling out basically all the contents. Even properly diluted things like 'Earth Juice' and kelp products clogged it."
1,Got Walk?,"If you had a half star, or MINUS star, I would select that. Too much walking required to keep pressure. Having to initially walk 80 feet to build pressure, then 10 to 20 feet to keep pressure was very time consuming and cumbersome. Also very hard to get handle on properly. The threads were not defined well, so the handle would screw on unevenly resulting in leakage. Perhaps the size (4 gallons) is too large. Though it is convenient to have a larger amount, the size requires the incessant walking. Cleaning it was very difficult, again because of the additional walking to clean out the hose. Had I bought it from a store shelf, it would go back in a heartbeat."
2,Wish it had a hand pump too,I bought this unit to water my indoor plants in the winter. I works well to haul water throughout my house but once the water level goes below halfway it needs frequent repressurizing so I have to push it back and forth as I'm standing in one place spraying. A hand pressure pump would enable me to add pressure without having to move the unit away from my spraying target.
2,not for a greenhouse or small garden,"I thought this would be a good replacement for the 3 gallon B&D versapak sprayer that is no longer made, since 1 gallon sparyers are too small and I can't use a pump sprayer because of medical reasons. It is probably good for a large garden or large greenhouse, but not small ones like mine. It won't work and compress on linoleum,most of my carpets, and sometimes not on the slate floor in the greenhouse. I especially don't like standing in my greenhouse constantly rolling it back and forth in one place to keep it working. I am donating this one to a church so they can use it on their grounds and will have to go back to a 1 gallon rechargeable for myself. Wish someone would make a 3 or 4 gallon power sprayer for gardens again."
5,Gilmour sprayer,I really like my Gilmour sprayer! It totally takes the work out of pumping and it was very reasonably priced!!Lois Andrews
4,Great for bad backs,When I first got this I thought it was the best thing since sliced bread. Then when I got it out today for the second season I could get no more than a drip or two out of it. Figured it was the pump gone bad. Went to drain the 4 gallons of weed killer out of it and discovered a film over the screen on the other end of the drain plug. Cleaned it out and tried again and it worked like new again. If you're having problems with the pressure try cleaning that screen. I also took out the internal air thing inside the reservoir and emptied liquid out of it. I couldn't even spray if I had to use that 2 gallon job that you have to pump. My back won't take it. I did get an extension for this one so no more bending over. I would recommend it.
2,Works but you have to do a lot of Walking!,"This sprayer will spray a distance of 20 feet after you have walked 80 feet to build the pressure. The problem is, after 10 seconds of spraying it only sprays 8 ft high. So you walk another 80 feet. I must have walked a mile watering a few of my dwarf fruit trees in the back yard. Sorry I spent the money on this one. A Nice Idea But not practical for an orchard."
1,Save your money,"I bought this last june and have used it three times last year. When i was done i rinsed it out(hose and tank) and hung it upside down over the winter. Here it is April of the next year and nothing!!!!! No pressure, nothing. After draining the 3 gallons of roundup i inspected the tank, nothing worked. Don't waste your money, not enough pressure (when it did work) no repairing this baby. I cleaned the inlet screen like some suggested...and nothing. How are you supposed to check the inside pressure tank when you can't get your hand inside the tank? Gilmore should be ashamed of themselves for releasing such a poorly tested product. If you notice most of the favorable reviews for this product are around 2008. I bought mine in 2011 and most of the reviews after that are not favorable....manufacturing problem or defective design?"
1,"""Won't hold air""","This sprayer is junk. It is such a hassle to send stuff back I well probably take this to the landfill. The problem is that it does not hold enough air to spray much. After pushing it about 20 feet I can spray about 3 weeds, then then I have to push it another 20 feet to spray 3 or 4 more weeds. After spending way to much time with this I pored the content in my old pump sprayer and finished the job. This was supposed to replace my old pump sprayer that I have had for 10 years. I did notice that some people gave it 5 stars so maybe I got a defective one. This is the change you take when you buy online."
4,Interesting,"I bought this deck thinking that this was a tarot deck...boy, was I surprised when I got the set. However, not to be bogged down, I sat down and went through the Book and then even did a few readings for myself and my friends.It was powerful, to say the least! The readings are quite accurate and on the dot. I never thought that it would happen, but I have come to develop a respect for this method of divinition.You can use this deck like a regular tarot deck as well and it still provides you with the answers you seek! This is how interesting this deck is.I must say that I loved it!"
3,Nature,"Plenty of ambience, with imitation of natural sounds. I agree, not for everyone though. I likedThe Orphan's Lamentmuch better for throat-singing."
2,good but not enough throat singing,I bought this for Tuvan throat singing and was presented with long periods of silence and perhap's the odd warble in the background! One track on the CD (you can just hear 'em) has throat singing.
3,"Likeable characters, lackluster plot","I liked the character of Jennifer Marsh. She's smart, funny and highly relateable. I enjoyed Judy Fitzwater's style. She seems to really like her characters and the world she created for them. There's more wit, and less slapstick, in her writing than Evanovich (the writer she's compared to on the cover). But there's not really that much of a plot here. I figured it out before the end and that ruined much of the fun for me."
2,OK if you need a quick read,"This book is okay if you need a quick summer read, but the writing is terrible and the plotline is incredibly thin and transparent. The author should work on fleshing out her characters and putting a bit more effort into writing a true mystery, and not something where the murderer's identity is obvious in the first few chapters."
1,LG HBM- 300 Bluetooth Headset Black.,"I think this product should get pulled out of the market. In orde to change it from left to right side you have to turn the top section not the clip itself, which it has alot of problems. Because when you answer a call and you push the button to answer a call, the whole top section turns."
3,Hmmm UNCOMFORTABLE,So this is my third bluetooth and I read all the reviews and I have to agree that this one is very uncomfortable. I have small ears so it doesn't really fit into mine. The sound quality is good on my end but I am told there is an echo on the other end. I was happy witht he price and if my ears were a little bigger maybe I'd be more happy with the product....:-)
2,Bad Bluetooth!,"Saw good deal for a bluetooth earpiece, so I took it. The installation was a little tricky at first, but once i got it paired with an LG Chocolate, it was functional. Tested it out all over the house, and it was very staticky and distorted over 10 feet. Used it driving, and lost bluetooth link with phone within seconds of driving underneath any tunnels. Not a quality bluetooth earpiece. Look to Motorola or Jabra for a decent one."
5,Great Working Earpiece,This is a great product. It actually fits into my ear properly and I can hear clearly through it. It is easy to operate and the charge last for many days. I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for an earpiece that fits comfortably and is just the right size.
4,worth the sale price (but not at full price),"+comfortable+easy to put on+fair-to-good sound quality+full charge lasts approximately 2-3 weeks+fully compatible with Blackberry Pearl and Motorola RAZR+nice style with black and ""alloy"" accents-some callers claim to hear echoing-not the best sound quality (I like Logitech better)"
3,Not that great sound clarity,"plus+:best use for messenger chatting, audio playback.simple usagestylish looksminus-:Sound breaksdesign is a draw back, the straight body and the mic hole directly at the bottom , makes the mic point away from your mouth , so the other end listens only to a small part of your vocal energy which gets reflected from surroundings, ans as you can imagine if you speak out in a open area, you are actually transmitting less!the ear piece is not ergonomically designed, it is to stiff and only makes your ear hole large!! and swell.over time, the whole set up gets loosened and eventually will start falling off which ofcourse makes you do some circus feats in crowd!"
1,echo,This thing is pretty but it echo's horribly and makes the callers who i talk with annoyed because it keeps making their voice echo: especially at higher volume levels. Bad design needs noise canceling technology or a microphone. Do not buy: get a Samsung or Motorola headset instead. You will be happier...
5,one of the best games ever,ythis game makes you use your head and it makes it fun. Their are many paths to victory and it is cool to be able to fight your way through DC but remember to beef up your air force because America won't hold back their jets justs because you only have stukas (big mistake on my part)
2,Too slow,"Way too slow, bad graphics and awful sound. There are a lot of missions to keep you occupied, but the campaigns stink because they are way too long and you can only be the Germans. If you have to buy this game buy it for the computer or better yet buy Panzer General II or III."
5,One of the greatest,"This game not only entertains, it also educates. I learned a lot of stuff about tactics (such as the effects of both offensive and defensive artillery upon infantry, tanks, etc), the uses of different types of units, and the elements of blitzkrieg.After playing a hundred or so hours it will have you feeling as if you are a compitent general, capable of changing the course of history.Of the many things I learned from this game was how effective an army could be held at bay at a natural barier (such as a swamp) by a dug-in force with artillery. After learning this I heard of many true battles which used this exact same tactic (such as the marines holding on for their lives during the early stages of the Korean war).The game even inspired me to write a book."
4,"History, As it should have been!","All I can say about this game is WOW! I've had it for about a year and I still haven't gotten tired of it. The fun part of this game is that each battle has a different outcome according on how well (or not so well) you do. Two weeks ago I finally beat the U.S. and unified Europe and North America under German leadership! If your a fan of WWII and alternate history, this game is for you."
1,The title should be changed,"Being the owner of an old edition, I recently bought this one, thinking that it would be an updated version. To my surprise, this new edition does not have anythying to do with the book published by the late Dr. Bailey, it is so changed that it should receive a new name. Even though the pictures of the old edition were in black and white, they are far superior to the microscopic pictures of the new edition. Regretfully, I felt cheated.CHRISTIAN A. RICAURTE, M.D.P.O.

3,Not Exactly,"A few books on the market claim that you can crochet material that ""looks and feels like knitting"". Yes, you can make stitches that look similar. You can make an entire project that resembles knitting.The truth is that a crochet stitch uses more yarn and makes a denser fabric. There is no way the crocheted fabric will feel and drape like something knit.If needle knitting is giving you wrist trouble, buy a book on loom knitting instead. And, crocheters...take the same advice."
4,From Needles to Hook,Haven't used this book allot but it does have very good tips and instructions. I like trying some of the stitches I've never done before and will keep working with it more because I like the look of knitting but don't like to knit. This is perfect for that.
4,Gift for someone who can't buy,My good friend is incarcerated buy earns a little extra through crocheting. This book is a great source for anyone of limited budget.
5,Just what I've been looking for,I have been looking for a book to help me convert knitting patterns using crochet stitches.This book is the one! I am very happy with the reasonable price and prompt service I received. The book's condition is just as it was described. I look forward to using this service again in the future. Thank you
1,Disappointed,"The cover states ""Complete Guide to Converting Knit Patterns to Crochet."" This led me to believe I would find step-by-step instructions for taking a knit pattern and converting it to crochet. Not so. The only really helpful advice for converting is the recommendation for substituting yarns to obtain the correct gauge. Then there is a page and a half devoted to the importance of gauge and suggestions for what to do with all your gauge swatches. The rest of the book contains crochet patterns using stitches that resemble popular knit stitches. Any experienced crocheter could figure that out on their own, or just open a crochet stitch guide. To truly live up to the title and description of the book, it should have contained several complete knit patterns, with detailed step-by-step instructions for converting the pattern and the completely converted crochet instructions. Basically, it's just another crochet pattern book."
2,Not as good as I thought,"I have to agree with the person who said it's basically another crochet book. The patterns aren't as exciting and the instructions for transferring the patterns from one genre to another aren't too clear. I will use it, but it's not what I thought it would be."
2,Save your money.,"If you already understand concepts such as gauge, spend your $25 elsewhere. How do you convert knit patterns to crochet? Well, apparently, you take the measurements from the knit pattern and crochet something that looks the same. That is all the book tells you. As others have said, there aren't step-by-step directions, as the title implies. Instead buy a good crochet stitch guide, and convert the patterns on your own, because it all boils down to something that looks similar."
1,"No, it isn't",This is just a book of crochet patterns that mimic knit stitches and there are plenty of other more interesting crochet pattern books than this one on which to spend your money.
3,"Kids loves it, but Glow-in-the-dark doesn't work","The title of this review pretty much says it all. The costume fits my 4-yr-old great, and he thinks it is the best thing ever. But the Glow in the Dark feature does not work. We let it ""soak up"" light for at least a half hour before turning off the lights and there was not even a blurry haze to be seen. you're probably just as good off buying the regular costume."
1,Rommel was no nazi,"Contrary to the uninformed box cover of this video, Rommel was never a member of the nazi party. He was however a genius at his craft who treated the enemy with a chivalrous respect. This video has standard WW2 footage and an uninformed soundtrack."
2,Think Again!,"I thought this would be a great product as I stay awake to read while my hubby falls asleep, the lights in our bedroom tend to keep him up. However, this gives off such a small, very dull amount of light that I can barely read with it. The light tends to focus on one small area, not the whole page, so if you're a quick reader, you'll constantly be moving this. Also, awkward shape, not comfortable at all to hold. Sorry, waste of money!!"
3,Mini LightWedge/ Book light,This was a great idea in theory for my little one to read in his bed at night... but the battery died very quickly. Probably better for stowing away in a car glove box for using once in a while only...
2,lightwedge review,This light though small enough to put in your pocket needs to have the magnification over the whole plastic surface. The light done not really help that much for reading.
4,Great little Light for car trips,"I always use my mini in the car on long road trips, for ease and convenience it can't be beat. Batteries lasts a long time. I have had my mini for several years and have only had to replace them twice. I love the the hard case it comes with, to protect it in my purse. I did use the magnification bar but now wear glasses. It illuminates the surface of the glass, this makes smaller books much easier to use with it than large books. You have to be careful not to point the end of the magnification bar toward the driver as the light emanating from it is very bright and can distract the driver. My children like using it also."
2,Close to wrothless,Takes too much time to install as the prongs are not sturdy and or sharp enough. Product is a joke.
4,simple but not very effective,This connector is very simple and easy to use but it fails to pierce the cable being connected to about half the time.
4,Every little boy's dream room!,"I'm re-doing my son's room in Spiderman. I bought the sheets and the comforter, along with some wall-clings, a hamper, lamp and other accessories. He can't wait to go to bed each night! He LOVES his Spiderman room. The sheets were a little rough when I took them out of the package. But I washed them with a double shot of fabric softener, and they came out nicely. And he loves them so that's all that matters!!!"
1,caution,"I ordered this item, Spiderman 3 sheet set, as shown here and instead received a ""Spider Sense"" sheet set. The colors and patterns are totally different, so the sheet set did not coordinate with the Spiderman 3 comforter I purchased!"
2,Think Twice,"I wasn't expecting heavy sheets by any means, but I was hoping they would last through the first wash. The fitted sheet and flat sheet washed fine, but the pillow case came apart and frayed on one side leaving it useless. Very disappointed. These sheets were to help our youngest transition to a ""big-boy bed""."
5,Spiderman Sheets,These sheets are your typical superhero sheets. My 5-year old loves his new sheets. They wash easy and do not shrink. Would definitely recommend these to anyone who wants to get it for their little super hero.
5,Delibes: Lakme - Sutherland,A brilliant rendition of Delibes: Lakme - runs about 13 minutes and every minute is a delight. Sutherland captures the full essence of the opera.
3,Crazy Expensive Inks,"I was looking for a printer that would handle LARGE pieces of paper, and this does the job splendidly. If I were rating the printer and only the printer, I'd give it 4 stars. BUT, the inks for this thing are ridiculously EXPENSIVE! I paid about $450.00 for this at a brick 'n' mortar store but when I went to replace the inks, it cost me $30 bucks... PER COLOR. Because you have to buy black, cyan, magenta and yellow separately, to replace them all costs over $120 bucks! It's crazy to invest 25% of a printer's total cost EVERY time I need ink. Also, it has a nasty habit of shutting down entirely when the inks ""expire."" I don't print very often so it's a waste of money to toss out half-full (half-empty?) cartridges due to age. Overall, I would recommend this printer only if you have an uncle in the ink business who can get you a sweet deal on replacement inks."
2,Not a GE part,"The product shipped was not the product I ordered. The ad clearly states, ""General Electric WB21X5243 Infinite Burner Switch. by General Electric"" The part shipped was a 5500-512 replacement for the GE product. I have not installed it yet. It may work just fine, but I would rather have the exact part I ordered."
4,Handy everyday accessory,Quality from Gerber. This pocket knife easily clips to a pants pocket and with its size you never know its there until you need it. Blade is sharp enough to handle any task a small knife like this would be used for.
5,Great little knife,I keep one of these in my shirt pocket at all times at work. Its easy to lose clipped in pants pocket. I'll probably buy the Gerber Ridge serrated model 5998 next time. the 5998 is identical to 5874 but it is serrated.
4,A great book about a true Native Medicine man.,"This is another great book by Douglas Boyd. Mad Bear was one of Rolling Thunder's teachers. This book shows some insight to the common thread that medicine people share; it also shows their different personalities. Mad Bear had a special connection with people, he had a way of making people smile and be happy. I highly recommend this for anyone who is studying medicine people. This book is constistant with the quality of Doug Boyds other books such as Rolling Thunder and Swami."
2,"Promising beginning, but a let down in the end...","First off, let me say I like the ""set-up"" of this game a great deal. The game is actually a story told in the first person view by the main character. The plot therein is actually fairly well thought out considering the linear type story (a fault of the genre, nothing against the play of the game).The true problem of the game is (while beautiful) that it's just very boring. After about the third ""level"" the puzzels and such go from intelligent to tedius. Nothing however burdens this game like the fighting. Wave after wave of the same enemies at periodic intervals throughout the entire game. While the fight scenes probably look interesting to your friend watching you over your shoulder, they are in reality, just the same 4 buttons combos over and over and over and . . . well you get the point.A promising start, but in the end a bit of a snoozer."
4,FUN!!!!,"This game is mainly fun but can be hard when starting out... It's hard sometimes to learn the moves and not to fall and kill yourself. If your a person that likes a challenge, then you should probably get this game!!"
4,"Good game, but it gets better in the future.","I am a fan of free roaming games and this is just a bit short of one. Yes you can roam all over the current area you are in but you cannot go back once you are done. The mazez are very good and the free form fighting is good as well. The only drawback of this game that I can think of is that everytime you fight enemies it is like it is a boss battle. exmp. You walk into a room, a cut scene shows what kind of enemy is there, you fight about 15 to 30, then a cut scene shows you scheath your sword and a save station pops up. Good thing it changes with the next series. Overall a very well mapped out game."
4,Short but sweet.,"Prince of Persia is a great game. The puzzles are challenging and the traps are hard to get by without damage but being in control of his amazing athletic ability plus the ability to control time is what makes this game special. Don't like how you just died? Just rewind time and try again. Too many enemies? Freeze a couple of them in time or do a mega freeze and slow all of them down. Unfortunately, the game is kind of short. I once finished the game in 7 hours. Even though this game is short it is very intense. This is an amazing game."
1,Prince of poo poo,"This game is way over rated!!!! camera problems, fighting control problems, and hyped up way too much!!! after reading reviews i expected the best game ever and now I feel robbed!! honestly i had more fun, actually WAY MORE FUN on the gameboy advance version!! with this title hope for the best , expect the worst..."
3,Don't let looks fool you,"The first time I played Prince of persia I bought this one.I thought the fightingwould be great but I was wrong.First of all, the combat is like you hit the enemyhe falls but dosen't die, so you have to stab him with the dagger,which theytry to make the prince all like bad and everything but it ruins his fightingstyle when he's kicking butt then he has to lose his precious time to take his dagger and stab the enemy IN THE BACK!!!!!and sometimes he fighting has to staband another enemy kills you, its so frustrating.Everything but fighting is the best, but do yourself a favor, BUY WARRIOR WITHIN INSTEAD!!!!!! and if you likethat buy THE TWO THRONES and buy this."
4,Sweet but tricky,"I enjoyed this game a lot. However there were several parts that were very frustrating. It might be that I'm not very good at platforming but some parts took me a long time. The same goes for some combat parts. Countering was a hard for me and I guess I didn't utilize some tricks that would have helped. What I said aside the game was well made, had a good story, and I enjoyed it."
1,Boaring game,This is the most boaring game l have ever played it was a wast of money and l wouldnt buy it for five dollars. would anyone one like to buy it for $35
2,Prince of Persia: Crap of Time,"This game has been so hyped up. On every site I've seen it has gotten high reviews, and I couldn't wait for the awesome game. Hannukah rolls around, and I open my gift and there is Prince of Persia. I pop it in my gamecube and at first the game looked really cool. You could run off of wall, jump over people and kill them, and do all this other cool stuff. But, I saw through that. This game is the most reptitive, boring game I've ever played. All you do is jump for poll to poll, push things, pull things, I mean who wants to do that? I really don't have the time for this game. If I was abssesed, maybe it would be fun, but this game just pisses me off. Sometimes I can't even figure out where to go. Don't even waste your time with this game."
1,GRRRRRRRRRRR!,What is that game which is not compatible with the Video Card Nvidia Geforce 4 MX 440 ?
1,HOW SMART IS A CAVE MAN?,THIS GAME HAS GOT TO BE THE WORST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED.YOU PLAY A CAVE MAN WHOSE ONLY WEAPON IS A CLUB.yOUR JOB IS TO RUN AROUND EAT FRUITS AND BANG ANIMALS OVER THE HEAD TILL THEY DIE SO YOU CAN FEED YOUR TRIBE.ALL THE GRAPHICS LOOK LIKE SOMETHING YOU'D SEE ON AN OLD ATARI GAME. I FOUND MYSELF MAKING MY CAVEMAN RUN AROUND FULL SPEED UNTIL HED PASS OUT(THE ONLY KICK I GOT OUTTA THE GAME)ANDGO FLYING HEAD FIRST ONTO THE FLOOR SNOREING AWAY.sOMETIMES IF AT THE TIME iI WAS RUNNING UP A HILL HE'D PASS OUT AND JUST ROLL BACK DOWN SNOREING AWAY.EXACTLY WHAT I FELT LIKE DOING.
4,A nice washable pad!,This is great for babies. It is soft and just the right size for newborns to about 3-4 months old babies ie until they learn to roll over. I love the color - it can be used for both boys and girls. I would recommend this. The cover is washable. You can even hand wash the pad.
2,Is this a german book?,"Yes. It is true that this is a german book. But there are a bunch of weird questions. Let me give you an example.Der Kriegsroman ""Wo warst du Adam?"" ist vonA. Erich Maria Remarque B. Alfred Doeblin C. Heinrich Boell D. Hermann BrochI don't think that they will give such a weird question in real SAT"
2,not the pc version,"I am playing this game on ps2, but compared to playing it on the computer years ago, this version is quite bad, the grahics are extremly hard to see, the soldiers and units are very tiny and hard to see, the control of your commando etc. is terrible, the cusor and pad on ps2 controller will not help at all, the enemy units come at you so fast, and you can't shoot em down fast enough.I am quite disappointed in the ps version as compare to the pc version of years ago .Read the recview above in the game description area, it is quite accurate.As a command and conquer purist player from years ago, this ps version disappoints greatly."
2,"Some gripping moments, nothing resolved","Sounds pretty much like the experience of life, I suppose. In my life, fortunately, I don't have to spend the day watching and listening to men gracelessly weathering the pangs of inner turmoil. Most of the people I know have the good manners to hide their 'quiet desperation' until they're at home and the dog is within kicking range. I love Godard and foreign film, but this 'in-your-face' pretensiousness is inexcusable. Still, offensive anti-American content is worth at least 2 stars!"
5,Great,Arrived when promised. This cart is as great as it was advertised. It can haul almost anything with little effort.
4,Very good cart with some really stiff parts.,"Tip the wheels come with tires deflated, inflate them before installing the wheels unless you have a compressor handy.The release for the handles (to unfold) is very stiff on my sample and can't be released by hand; hopefully it will loosen up with use. Similarly the release to fold the cart. Folded the cart has a lot of windage making it difficult to fix on a car top carrier and inadvisable to strap to the life lines on boat. Overall a very good cart.BTW the narrow wheels will sink into soft sand or soil (hardly a big surprise though). Works just fine on any reasonable surface.Would have given it a 5 except for the sticky releases and the cost. There is a high premium for the foldability."
5,Workhorse without the stable,"Bought this utility cart to carry larger and heavier loads than the older resin wheelbarrow. Not only does it carry larger and heavier loads, the rubber bicycle-like tires make it easier to pull and push. Although collapsing and expanding the cart takes about 30 seconds, this is well worth the advantage of being able to store it in a 24"" x 10"" corner space, especially since the cart is only used several times per month.I recommend buying the all-aluminum model and the optional front panel."
4,Fun for all ages!,Bought this for my 3.5 yr old daughter. She loves it! She and her friends run around in the backyard chasing each other other. The nozzle is durable and easy to use.
1,False advertising,"If you order this mill, you will not receive the one described. You will receive the cheaper, wimpier product advertised at the bottom of the page, although you will be charged for the more expensive one. The one you will receive is powered by 4 AAA batteries, not 6, leaving it underpowered to perform its task. It will also NOT have a light as advertised. Amazon has been made aware of this ""error"" and promised to change the website, which they have not done!"
4,Disappointed,I receieved the Pepper Mill last month and was delighted with it until it stopped working. I have put in new batteries and still I can not get it to work. Very disappointing as the couple times I used it it was perfect.
3,"Fun to play, but gets old.","This game is great if you don't have anything better to do. Cool Boarders is really to easy in my opinion. Also after a while the tracks get boring and they start to seem alike which can be confusing. But it's still a cool game, like being able to pick what the person's wearing and being able to create your own snowboard. Also their is a whole lot of tricks,cheat codes, and boards to pick from."
4,Cool!,"This is a cool game if you like snowboarding and racing. There is only one problem and that is that this game is exremely easy to beat and after you beat it, it gets boring. If your looking for a long term game, i suggest renting it first."
4,Impressive,"This game is good for a rainy day.It can be fun for another day , also.I think that people really into snowboarding , like me , would like this game."
5,This game is great forever. you should buy this super price,"This game is great forever. I played again and again and again. Really. You can't be tired of this game. Trust me. This game have a lot of course, character, boards, tricks, cheat codes."
4,a wonderful little book,"Rosenfield's book stands out among mountains of books published on the trendy topic of mind and memory. Here he offers a most cogent argument, in the tradition of Hughlings-Jackson and Freud, against localizationist views, popular in the last century, now revived under the disguise of connectionist/computational models. As a historian of ideas, Rosenfield reports with vigor and clarity and classical precision; as a philosopher of mind (for that is what he is) he reasons with astonishing penetration and subtlety. Though this book might not get the attention it deserves today, as it is in many ways against the mainstream, mechanical conceptions of the mind, I have no doubt that it will eventually contribute to a emerging psychology of consciousness that does not flee from reality in search of simplistic ways of explanation."
2,poor design,"The knife is a little stiff to open.The scissors are not very good, and make your thumb hurt after just a little use (the part you push to cut stuff is a thin sheet of metal). The scissors also tend to not fold up properly without some finesse. The scissors' poor effectiveness make them useless when you already have a knife with you, and you can get an equally decent (or even better) knife for less.I give it two stars because the knife is unique and you can buy it if it really catches your fancy, but I highly recommend almost anything else. Go to a large discount retailer for cheaper knives of equal quality, or spend just a few dollars more here on Amazon and buy the SOG mini Autoclip."
5,Purple Golf Tees,We were looking for a small gift item for a golf tournament and the purple color of the tees matched our tournament color theme perfectly...and the price was great!
2,Access Guides: Not What They Used to Be,"Years ago, the access guides were revolutionary: everything was listed block by block - they way you experienced a place. The reviews were pithy and comprehensive.Somethings changed. The Rome guide omits many hotels and has poor descriptions of the major attractions. You can do much better on the web."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME!,This game is horrible.... boring.... and a whole lot of wasted time and money. The Graphics are horrible and they make Crash Team Racing look as if it were super high tech. Do Not Waste your time.......let alone your pocket book. It could not keep a 8 year old interested......YUK!
5,This is a very informative-well written book.,"Dr Trahair is a Consulting Psychologist at LA Trobe University in Australia. He has written a 175 page book relating his personal experience in undergoing total joint replacement of his hip with additional personal histories of 14 other individuals. If hip replacement is in your immediate future you will find your counterpart among them. I am Jack Kelley author of ""On Being Hip"" which outlines my own experience with the problem of degenerative joint disease. It is also available through amazon. I recommend that those with these problems obtain Dr. Trahair's book, a view from downunder that you will find rewarding and informative."
3,NOT Rick Springfield's Australian band,"In 1970, Rick Springfield was the lead guitarist and songwriter for an Australian rock/pop band called ""Zoot."" I want to make clear to any Rick Springfield fans looking for Zoot material, this album is NOT by that same band.THIS ""Zoot"" is a contemporary swing band. I have only listened to the song samples, so I cannot really comment as to the actual merit of the CD (the samples sound great, so I DID give it 3 stars).A proper item description from Amazon (with more than the CD title and track listing) would have been nice here."
4,Druha Trava,"I liked this CD, it was in english,, I prefered it in Czech...I use to have one in Czech. Liked it a lot better.. But this is a good CD,, in great shape"
3,Black Screen Problem,"I have had this camera since March 2006, and in February 2009 the LCD screen went black, making it unusable. I liked the camera for the most part, but I found that it often produced pictures where the subjects looked unnaturally white. There was also a problem with red eye. I tried to fix these problems by changing the settings, but I didn't really know what I was doing, and the options were not very clear. One good thing was that the battery lasted a long time before needing recharging."
4,Put this CD in your collection,"Rebecca Parris is the real deal. Her phrasing is world class. Her tone penetrates and delivers the song with class and integrity. I beieve that Boston is becoming a source of totally legit Jazz artists and Rebecca can be considered one of the founders of that growing reputation. The CD sounds like it was done in one take...and I don't say that as a criticism because in my opinion, it is a honest and back to basics approach to Jazz music that is refreshing in today's world of over-produced music."
2,You Don't Know Me...really?,I had anticipated a strong choice of songs from Rebecca but I was disappointed . Too many draggy ones...not up to her potential or past performances.
5,A GREAT GAME,"I bought this game knowing I'd love it, and I was right, this game is AWESOME. The controls are realistic and generally the physics are. But this game is NOT for everyone, only for those who would really be in this sort of thing. You might also just want to give it a try, who knows, you might wind up loving it."
5,Sierra Soaker 70,"FANTASTIC hydro-pack with space, comfort, pockets, etc---will by another one to have 2 so I can share this great product with someone else who might need it (bought it for and used it at Burning Man)"
4,Great pack!,"I bought this pack for mountain biking and hiking. It holds a lot of water for how small it is. The only complaint I have is that it is small. You can fit a protein bar and maybe a couple of band-aids. You can't fit much more than that. I wouldn't put my keys in it because they would be right up against the water pack and carrying things like a compass, knife, sun block, first aid kit or anything is not possible. Don't get me wrong this is a great pack for a couple hour hike or a long ride. It is also very durable. I use it all the time and it is still in great shape and have had no problems cleaning it."
2,Nice Fit but Leaked through spout,It was very comfortable and easy to fill. The major issue was the spout leaked when the pack was filled. It was a big mess and major pain. We returned the pack to the seller and still need to find a reasonable replacement.
1,non functioning product,"got it for new years 2 days prior to it ,opened the package put liquid in,left my house, and found half of my mummers suit had fluids all over it leaving me to freeze like no other the whole day till it dried/froze.In conclusion crappy seller crappy product"
1,Not Durable!,I bought this for my boyfriend to use while mountain biking. We went on a biking trip and when he went for a drink there was no water. The bladder had a hole in it and was empty. The plus was that it was a hot day and the water cooled his back off. Frustrating to lose your water with a brand new piece of a equipment. I returned it and bought another brand.
1,The Tool That Never Should Have Been!,"If you expect a folding multitool like all of Gerber's other products, with the added convenience of being able to change from blunt nose to needlenose plier configuration at will, FORGET IT!!! The pliers DO NOT RETRACT on this tool, almost doubling its bulk, and defeating the entire purpose of the FOLDING multiplier. This thing might be okay in a tool box, but it has no business on a hiker's belt. What Gerber SHOULD have done was to provide optional jaws for the already existing perfectly servicable multipliers so that customers could modify their existing tools...."
5,The perfect tool for me,"The evolution 650 came as an unexpected pleasant surprise. I work in utility construction and this tool has saved me countless trips back to the truck or toolbox. There are a few notations for the prospective customer that, with the exception of one, haven't been an issue for me. 1.the pliers portion DOES NOT retract into the handle portion like other Gerbers and (the disappointment for me) 2.the amount of slop in the installed plier head. Neither have truly caused any concern for me but I would have expected the pliers to have been a little more ""close tolerance"". Overall I have been Very pleased."
2,A narrow vision of education,"Misrepresentation of learning theories contrary to the authors' biases make this book useful to readers who already know better. I received it as a gift but wouldn't buy it for myself. This book does little to round out a library in psychology, educational psychology or developmental psychology."
1,worst game ever,"this is the absolut worst game i have ever played in my entire life. the controls are terrible, and scoring is just pure luck because the puck doesn't go where you shoot it. i can't explain how crappy the graphics are. this game is so bad i want to kill myself for buying it (yes, it's that bad). do not ever buy this. if someone buys this for you, take it back and get the origional blades of steel for nintendo, it is a much better game."
1,Don't even rent it !,It's a very very very slow game and the graphics are poor... I compare this game to NHL 92 (EA Sport) !
3,Unbelievable writing!,"Ms. Valdes writes about the Cuban despair better than any writer around. Her writing is remarkable, her sentences just leap off the page.I do agreee with over reviewers who say the beginning is fantastic and then it slowly peters out. After a few days of thinking about it, I believe this is intentional. Her energetic style (at the beginning) coincides with the optimism many Cubans felt at the beginning of the revolution. Her writing becomes flat, sad, and full of dull rage as her characters live out the failed promises of the revolution.Perhaps my interpretation is too fanciful, but I can't get this story out of my head nonetheless. I don't recommend this book to people who don't have a sense of modern Cuban culture or history, I think those readers will be lost. It's an great example, however, of ""exile"" literature."
4,Funny and irreverent,"It's a wonderful satire, dripping sensuality and wit. The description of Havana's sizzling nightlife before the revolution is fantastic, you will actually feel you're partying with the characters, and just for the way Cuquita, the main character, makes fun of herself (and practically everyone else, including you-know-who) and her delusions with a man that rarely gives her a thought, I can almost forgive her stupidity in waiting for him for thirty years. The ending depressed me, though. Tip: if you can, read it in its original language."
2,I expected more,I have to agree with the other readers. This book became confusing at times and I didn't understand the significance of the recipes. I found myself skipping through a few pages just so I could finish the book. I wished she would have had better transitions throughout the book. Great story that could have been told better!
2,I'm Lost!,"I easily became confused due to the author's abrupt change of narrator from chapter to chapter. Although the storyline was interesting, I did not enjoy the interrupting recipes and such. I also became frustrated with the endless talk of XXL. I did not understand the importance of him in the book. It was difficult reading. I suggest you try for yourself and if anybody understands the underlying meaning of this book PLEASE email Me! I would love to know."
2,"Promising in the start, boring later on","When I started reading this novel (the writer was recommended to me by my Spanish teacher), I said wow, this is a female counterpart of the Cuban writer Pedro Juan Gutierrez (I recommend his novel Dirty Havana Trilogy), but after promising start, it quickly became boring and trivial. It seems that in the second half of the book the writer completely lost the concept and her blind hatred of the Cuban regime prevailed over her artistic intentions. The book reads like political (anti)propaganda from a bitter pessimist in the exile. Disappointing!"
5,Fresh sound,"Awesome band. The music on this cd has a fresh sound. It is creative and meaningful. Good from start to finish, you don't find many groups with cd releases this good!"
4,Opening Doors to Personal & Spiritual Growth,"I greatly admire this author's ability to put in plain language what it means to change one's life--from the ""treadmill""style of living to being guided by our inherent spiritual gifts. The examples she gives, drawn from everyday life, make the concepts of personal and spiritual growth accessible to all readers. Instructions and suggestions for ways to bring our lives into alignment with our spiritual selves are informative and easy to follow. I'd recommend this book for any reader who is presently feeling that there must be more to life than the present routine they are following. There are answers here that are as humble as they are wise. When I finished reading it, one of my thoughts was that it would be a wonderful book for teenagers to read as they faced some of the tough challenges of moving into adulthood. I would also recommend it to any friend who has ""hit the wall"" in their work or personal life."
3,has the teams but not indivdual players,"As the other reviewer said, all the teams are here and there a lots of play options. However I was disappointed that I could not see indivdual players on the teams - you get a player position and number to display but not a name."
3,an old game,this a good game but its pretty old so i would buy it at chep price in the used section. But it has all of the colleges which is cool.
4,Spice Hunter Garam Masala,"I needed this spice for a recipe and ordered it online as I was unable to find it locally. Two weeks ago, I found that Meijer's recently added it to their spice selection which was less expensive than purchasing online."
1,Great concept but completely unusable,This is a great idea but it was completely ineffective when used with the marshmallow guns from the same company. These pellets would constantly jam in the barrel. It was often impossible to generate enough force to push them out. I would have to remove the magazine from the gun and use a pencil to force the pellets back through the barrel. After fighting these pellets for about ten minutes I switched to regular marshmallows. Those worked great. These pellets wound up in the trash.
2,suspicious,"Hmmmm.......isn't it interesting that the majority of positive reviews of this item were all written within a 2 day span? June 20, 2000 must have been a VERY popular day for reviewing FIAR. I was going to buy this until I noticed all the glowing (fake?) reviews were written on the same day."
1,This Curriculum Falls Short of its Promise,"...The book states that it is a ""Complete Curriculum"" for the early years except for math and phonics... Without phonics and math you DO NOT have a complete curriculum. Math and Phonics are the most important subjects in the early years.This curriculum falls short in many areas. Take my advice and spend your hard earned money someplace else."
5,Beginning the Journey with Five in a Row!,"I will just begin homeschooling our children in a few short weeks. I have been doing research on many different homeschooling curriculums and find no comparison to Five in a Row.Within a short amount of time, I was able to choose the books that I plan to cover with my children for the next year and prepare my lesson plans.Jane and Steve Lambert have taken all of the guesswork out of homeschooling. They have provided many activities for you to choose from related to your child's age and areas of interest.Five in a Row is a literature based curriculum where you choose one of the books and read it to your child for five days in a row. Each day, then, you also do one of the activities that correspond to Bible, Art, Social Studies, Geography, History, Vocabulary, Science, Writing, Math, and Relationships with others. The curriculum is extremely flexible and doesn't require much time or effort...just dedication!"
5,very pleased,"wow! this curriculum is great! If you are looking for an after school supplement or for full time homeschooling it is a great approach. The idea is, you read the same book every day for five days. the lessons for those five days are based on the one book. every book chapter comes with a lesson plan. the plans are broad enough to allow you to take the lesson in any direction or follow the plan without waver. supper simple and fun. each book chapter comes with art, math, science, cultural studies, geography, literate, writing, etc...You have to buy or check out from the library each book. some books cost me 10.00 others where .01 from amazon. of course the library books were free. in the end, it cost me 2.00 a book."
1,I really wanted to like this curriculum!,"I really wanted to like this curriculum, but it just didn't fly. By and large the children enjoyed the art and some of the creative writing, but my kids were BORED with the majority of what this offers. I tried going to the web site but it is really just a Five in a Row love feast and I didn't get much assistance.The book choices are actually wonderful; it is just the contrived lessons that lack a real connection to what is relevant to children. My children have done much better picking a topic *they* are interested in and exploring that topic through a variety of ways."
5,Five in a Row is AWESOME!,"I have a five year old daughter and this is by far the greatest way I have been able to present information to her. It has been difficult for me to have her sit down for formal periods of ""classroom"" time and with this informal type of curriculum it has made both of our experiences with homeschool so much more pleasurable! Each book used in each lesson offers a plethora of activities in different subjects (ie. history, science, art, math, language/reading) that are all connected to the book that you are reading for that week. It's a cinch to keep my daughter focused. It's like an adventure every day with this curriculum! Great to use with Valerie Bendt's ""Reading made Easy""!"
5,Five In A Row - a fantastic homeschool experience!,"My children are using Five In A Row and loving it! We started out with Before Five In A Row, and now have ""graduated"" to Five In A Row.Five In A Row (FIAR) capitalizes on the natural desire for repetition found in children. The activities are educational, not merely entertaining, and can be done with minimal planning on my part.FIAR is also very flexible. The activities are easy to adjust to the abilities of my 5yo and 7yo.For homeschoolers looking for a gentle, simple way to educate your children, I highly recommend using ALL of the Five In A Row products."
5,Five in a Row Works Great,"If you are thinking of trying unit studies, I highly recommendthis series. I have used this curriculum for two years with mydaughter and have been very pleased.FIAR studies are a great value (...). My daughter is having fun learning, and I am having fun teaching! My mother and two sisters (all public school teachers) have been very impressed."
3,Has its pluses and minuses,"My wife gave me this knife as a birthday gift however I ended up exchanging it for a Wusthof Classic Ikon instead.Pro's:comfortable handleexcellent bladeWusthof's reputationPrice is much cheaper than other wusthof productsCon's:While the handle is comfortable it feels cheap (and is due to being plastic)For an expensive knife it doesn't have the look of onethe ""bolster"" is the entire length of the blade making electric sharpening very difficult towards the handle, manual sharpening would not be an issue."
5,"Sharp, balanced, good for beginner cook","I didn't buy my knife from Amazon.com, but from Williams-Sonoma. The knife is lightweight for a chef's knife and I like that. It's easy to manipulate, which is good for me because I am a beginner cook. As I build good knife technique this smaller size is easier for me to work with. Google the brand and model and you'll see that this particular knife is highly rated, as well."
2,"Not user friendly at all. Bad design, poor instructions.","Be ready with a set of thin walled metric and standard sockets and wrenches. The instructions on these stilts leave you completely in the dark on assembly. There are no clear pictures of how to properly assemble the product. The user is left guessing if the stilts are properly assembled. The manual is also very poor in instructions for first time users. The most surprising part is the hardware is both metric and standard on the same product. I don't understand why any manufacturer would mix both metric and standard nuts and bolts on one product. I mean, pick one! You must also have a thin walled socket set to assemble them. The straps are a pain to adjust and don't do a good job of securing you in place. Not recommended."
2,Not very happy,"I find the stilt's structure comparable with what is sold at a higher price, but the accessory parts like the spring tensioner, nuts & bolts, and straps are inferior. The weld on the wingnuts snapped off the first time I tightened them; you don't end up saving any money by the time you pay for all these extra replacment parts and any expedited shipping. Better to go pay more locally!"
4,"Nice iron, but.....","I also replaced a B & D with this wonderful new iron. It does everything it promises. But one thing I would change is the length of time it takes before it times out. Three minutes is a very short time if you are doing anything like quilting or sewing where you need the iron to be hot every 5 or 10 minutes. It seems I am always punching the button to get it to 'wake up' again. My old B&D had a 10 minute timer which was a lot better for what I use it for. Ironing yards of fabric, ironing shirts, etc when you are constantly using it, you can't beat the heat control and steaming action. But if you are doing crafts, look for one that has a longer 'time-out'. If there is a way to reprogram it for longer run time, I would love to know about it."
4,stopped steaming,I purchased this iron for the large capacity steam tank. It has been very reliable until recently when I needed to change the scale cartridge. That was completed and now the iron will not steam?? Any suggestions from anyone??? b
1,Don't Buy These Candles!,"These candles are not safe! The whole container gets hot, so hot that you can't touch it and the flame burns out of control. In trying to extinguish the flame, a person and the furniture were burned!"
4,Great singer/songwriter/muscian,"I can only comment on 3 of the songs on this album as I have only heard 3 of the tracks, ""I just don't recognize you anymore,"" ""Tell me,"" and ""Strangers"" all 3 of which are great songs. Most of the songs I have heard by him are acoustic guitar but Strangers is a piano ballad and quite good. I wish I could describe the songs in more detail but if you want to hear more than just 30 second clips check him out on Myspace and take a listen."
3,Bravo Bob Hastings!,"This is a strange, strange production, which moves at a snail's pace and is muddled and odd to begin with. However, the performance of unheralded Bob Hastings as a Pepto-Bismol chugging fight trainer is one of the greatest character acting jobs I have ever seen. Hastings is perhaps best known as the Ensign on McHale's Navy and Kelsey of Kelseys' Bar in All in the Family, but here he shows a depth and stunning conviction in his work that I never dreamed possible. Bob Hastings has never gotten his due as one of the finest character performers in Hollywood history."
2,Couldn't get past the poor editing,"This book initially interested me because I knew Erik Menendez briefly pre-crime and was interested in seeing how he's survived behind bars. However, I couldn't get past the numerous typos, grammatical errors, and all-around shoddy editing job in this book. They were just too distracting. I got the sense that Erik Menendez might have edited this himself with a smuggled night-light, a Sharpie, and too many prison distractions interrupting his flow. If you don't mind reading a book that screams, ""I yam a booke wit no editar,"" then go for it."
2,for children,"This pendulum was not made of metal or a true stone. It all felt like plastic. Like you would get from a 25 cent machine back in the 70s. It is great if you want to introduce a child to dowsing. If you are interested in a pedulum for yourself look for genuine gemstone, and other key discriptive words that desribe the type of materials you intend your pendulum to be made from. I returned the two pendulums for $1.59 postage. The seller was prompt at refunding my money, which is why I gave two stars."
4,I think its great,"Not sure why these other folks filters did not last so long - if you run hot water thru it, which it clearly states in the literature, then you will ruin it, and that's easy to do by accident. Even so, having done that a couple times without thinking, my bathroom filter only died after 10 months when I removed it and took it to another house - my kitchen unit is still going strong at more than a year with good-tasting water but I am going to replace it anyway just cause I think its time. Weighing costs of other filters, along with having to change them more often for other systems and ultimately commit them to landfills as well, I decided this was the way to go, but yes, when I buy my next house I will be installing a whole house filter to make the issue moot (I also have a filter on my shower at this point.) Its also easy to install - just follow the directions and be gentle with it . ."
4,Best bathroom upgrade; great for whole family,"I've had mine for a number of months and it's fantastic. The drinking water spout (it shoots up just like a fountain) is fantastic for brushing teeth, quick drink, taking pills, etc. Late at night I don't have to venture out to the kitchen for a quick drink of water. Kids love it too - and you can't complain at something that gets kids excited about drinking water, let alone cleaner, filtered water.Yes, it needs a little re-tightening here and there, but it's not a big deal. It's designed to be disposable when the filter runs out (After about a year), so I didn't expect it to be something that'd last forever. Can't imagine not having one in the bathroom anymore."
1,Piece Of Garbage,"No wonder this thing is cheap compared to Brita's other products. The threads that hook onto the faucet are weak and easily stripped from simple hand tightening, not to mention they try to stick this rubber washer in it that's just about the same size of the screw-on apparatus attached to this item resulting in the whole thing popping off soon as you turn on the water. I can't say enough bad things about this piece of useless junk."
3,So cool in theory but didn't fit our faucet,"I love this brand/style of water filter and have used it in our kitchen for years. Thought this would be a great one for the kid's bathroom - save those trips out for drinks of water - but, alas, it did not fit the small, pedestal sink. I'm sure if it had fit, it would have been AWESOME."
1,Not so good,"The taste of the water was good but I had problems with the light indicator. The first filter's light was red from the moment of installation. Amazon sent a replacement right away. I installed the second and the light was green at first but went to red within a few hours. The filter was probably good to use, just the indicator is malfunctioning. However, the indicator is important. Without it, how would I know when it is really time to replace the filter?The drinking fountain is a good idea but when using it the water would continue to flow heavily from the filter's spout, wasting a LOT of water. I'm sending both back and forgetting about this model until Brita does a better job of diverting water from the filter's spout to the fountain, and has a better indicator system."
1,Didn't work,"Burning feeling when used. Tried 1 tube, followed directions, and never noticed any difference."
1,Don't waste your money,This product did not work for me. The liquid was so thin that it ran all over the place and even worse itdidn't stimulate anything. I'll stick with Cialis.
1,WTF?,"Why is Amazon even carrying this? I'd call it aiding and abetting a swindler.All these products are ripoffs. Is Amazon going to start carrying powdered rhinohorn, or some other 'virility for morons' products?"
4,The Sunshine Boys,"The recipient of this movie, stated that it was received and is in excellent condition. He cannot wait to watch this. Thank you for taking care of this for me."
3,HI-larious!,But you'd probably have to understand Neil Simon to agree. This one has alot of that edge found in brighton beach memoirs which came several years later.
2,EMOTING WITH WALTER!!!!!!!!,"This movie is spoiled by the ridiculous, over-the-top performance by the highly overrated Mr. Walter Matthau, who redefines the word 'hammy.' That this performance was nominated for an oscar is a flat-out outrage... but typical for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences in the past thirty years..(Remember the theme from 'Shaft'?) George Burns gives a wonderful performance, which shines all the more in comparison to his co-star's. Burns was brought in as a replacement for his friend, Jack Benny, who died unfortunately before filming began. That Matthau was cast in the first place was a travesty, because this movie should have starred Burns and Benny!!! Now THAT would have been perfect casting!"
1,Sunshine Boys (VHS) review,"I was never able to get the VHS to work in any machine I tried. Consequently, I haven't been able tosee it anyway. Given that I can't see it I can't give it a good review. Very disappointed that a VHS I'veordered from Amazon is not functioning."
4,Another classic,A classic from Neil Simon. This movie does contain language and some material not suitable for younger viewers. They just don't make movies like this anymore.
3,Good movie,This is a great old flick. It is formatted so it has a commentary while the movie is playing. You can watch the movie without it but it is not easy to figure out how.
1,Not cute!,"Those teddy bears are not so cute as on the picture shown here. I got disappointed with them when I got them. You cannot see the eyes, when you try to move some fur to see the eyes, the fur fall down."
5,The most delicious olive oil!,"The most incomparably delicious olive oil ever...fruity, oh so flavorful, too delectable to consider cooking with. It makes everything you put it on taste scrumptuous! I only wish it was more available here in the USA."
1,deceiving advertising,"This product is marketed (see Nutella website) as 1. Healthy -- yet the first ingredient is SUGAR! Also their FAQs say there are no peanuts -- seems more honest (and safe for peanut allergy sufferers) to say no peanuts BUT not safe if you have peanut allergies because it has peanut oil! And with sugar, hydrogenated oil and artificial flavor, who in the world (except the marketers) would call this healthy? Why would anyone buy a product marketed with such deceit? Ingredients listed are Sugar, Peanut oil, Hazelnuts, Cocoa, Skim Milk, Reduced Minerals, Whey, Partially Hydrogenated Peanut Oil, Soy Lecithin: an Emulsifier, Vanillin, and Artificial Flavor. This list is from Amazon, because I didn't find an ingredient list on Nutella's site."
4,Two out of Three.,"From time to time my wife brings home a jar of Nutella. I like it, but only on rare occasion. The flavor is just too overpowering for me and I tire of it quickly. My wife loves the stuff on bread (toast) or crackers and she eats it with her afternoon or evening tea. She raves about the chocolatey-nutty flavor and can't understand why I don't see things the same way. Such is life. In any case, if it pleases her, I'm happy with it. Oh, I might add that the baby seems to like it too. That's two out of three.Gary Peterson"
3,unsatisfying,"This album feels really incomplete and repetitive. It starts off strong, as accordian and meat grinder are both strong tracks, however, from there on out it's a muddled mess. Where one reviewer complained about the songs being too short, I say that they're too long for what Madvillain does with them.It feels like they got together, smoked some pot, and said ""This would be a good idea for a song"", started it off strong, but then got bored and cut to the ending. Very one dimentional."
4,More like 4.5,"I thought this album was sick. However it isn't for everyone. I loved it because I know who both MF DOOM(Viktor Vaughn) and Quasimoto(Madlib) are and when I listenend to this album I first payed attention mostly to Madlibs beats, then after a spin I listened for Doom's lyrics. The reason I say it's not for everyone because I played it for a couple people and some did not like it because they say Doom's rappin was borin. Now I think their crazy but If you'r more into ""rappers"" (ex. Young Jeezy, T.I, 50, Tony Yayo....) you might not like this but if your into ""emcees"" (Ex. MF Doom, Common, Guru, Immortal Technique.....) you'll love the lyrics but I don't think ANYONE could hate on the beats provided by one of the most gifted and creative person you will ever hear. Theres a couple of standout tracks (for the most part all the tracks are equally good), but I highly reccommend listening to this disc all the way through."
2,MF Doom for Hipsters,"As a long time MF Doom fan (Bought ""Operation Doomsday"" when it came out), this was a huge disappointment. Madlib's production is like a lame rip off of Doom's steez and it just sounds crappy. A weak album that led to lame hipsters worshipping Doom. Cop the first Viktor Vaughn, the split Doom/Grimm EP, Operation Doomsday and KMD stuff. This album is unbelievably overrated."
3,ok,"I was skeptical when i heard the first track. Lyrically it was interesting, but the beats were blah..but it got much better and more interesting as it went along. This cd is definitely not for your Chingy or Ludacris croud, this is ecclectic as it gets. The reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because of the fact a lot of the songs are very short and seemed underdeveloped. it at times sounds like every idea Madlib though of during the process of making the album has been thrown in there, so they wouldn't be wasted."
2,Jusy OK,"I was expecting something more substantially ""experimental"" than this. The album starts out strong goes into boring quick and then remerges here and there towards the end. Hip Hop needs a lot more than this to pull it out of it's current slump."
3,madness,"The only other mf doom album I have is mm...Food. I bought this album because I thought it would be as good, but it wasn't. Don't get me wrong the tracks are tight but too short. Most of the songs are only a verse! Also, I had heard much about this ""Madlib"" character which is another reason for my purchase. In my opinion Doom drops better ground breaking beats on mm..Food than madlib does on this album."
5,actually a 4.5 stars,"first off, i agree some of the tracks are a bit odd, but its best not to dismiss anything that breaks what is considered the norm, otherwise why even listen to Doom if youre happy with Radio rap? the other thing to take into consideration is that Doom trips his words, they dont always rhyme like you think they should, thats just the style he uses on a few tracks.some of the things he says really make you think, and sometimes it takes a while to get what he is REALLY saying to you. Madlib's beats really compliment Doom's style really well. this is a gem i slept on, and i have turned many people onto this CD also, they also wonder how they missed this one. if you enjoy Indie/Underground music dont miss this one ,it seriously deserves a look."
5,And i thought vaudeville was great.....,"I am a big fan of madlib, as well as i've been a doom fan since doomsday came out(around 99), so when i first heard that these two guys were putting a record together it was to good to be true. If you've heard madlib's solo cd on blue note, you'll remember that doom was on a track, a little bit foretelling of future things to come i suppose. It has the classic doom samples from horror b films, pretty much teaming with madlib's jazzy-feel beats. this is a great album, and so far 2004 has been a great year for indie/underground hip-hop, a must for any indie fan."
5,Best Album of 2004,"This is my favorite album, hip hop or otherwise, released in 2004. Great lyrics and delivery from MF Doom and backing beats from Madlib. Have recommended this album to several friends who have all enjoyed it."
3,"Great Lyrics, too much filler","MF DOOM always brings it on the mic, every track with actual rhyming is realer than hell. However there are so many skits and filler taking up space on the album its not really that fun to listen to. One would probably be better off buying the actual tracks off iTunes."
5,"""eff Kanye West its MADVILLAIN.""",This was said about in another customers review. This is one of the only times that i will leave a review. GO AND BUY THIS NOW!!One fo the best hip-hop cds I've heard in a very long time.
5,LOL this cd is so siiick,"listen, i've been bumpin this cd since it came out, probably even before it came out cuz i got it off irc, but anyway...just to let you know, the song about how his girl cheats on him with himself is CRAZY and i'm still laughing about it over a year later.funny thing is it really gets deep, like he's real pissed that she cheated on him with his alter ego, and he really wants to kick his own ass. taking all her jewelry away.it's so creative, just that song alone. DOom's verses are all dope on this cd, but this one was the best. ok go get the cd if you don't have it. LATER"
4,Worth the Price of Admission,"I have listened to the cd three times now and have become more impressed with each spin. This is the first time I have listened to Doom for an entire CD--his flow sounds like a cross between Erick Sermon and Cappadonna (not bad company). The production is solid. Definitely the best I have heard this year. However, if ""3 Feet High and Rising"" rates an unquestionable 5, then this is more like a 4 to 4.5."
2,Listen BEFORE you buy,"Sometimes the hype-machine is wrongOff-beat rhymes, boring delivery...awfulHonestly, I don't like a single track of itIt is my 4th cd thrown into the ""to be pawned"" pile along with Fantastic Damage, Eminem Show and Carpal Tunnel SyndromePick up Mr. Hood and Operation Doomsday and then STOP while you're ahead!"
2,total crap,"i bet the people giving it 5 stars listen to hip hop since 2003. im a old hip hop head, i know the underground and the mainstream scenes, and trust me , this album is the most overated ever. this is a concept album , with wack beats, wack flows and wack rhymes, and no concept. nerds like it , because they think they are down with hip hop by buying this"
1,This isn't rap!! Where are the phat beats?!,"I was looking through the ""Rap"" section of FYE and was looking for something new. I asked the sales associate if he could recommend me something and he said, ""Yeah check out Madvillain, they're underground rap"". I never heard of ""underground rap"" before so I was hesitant but I bought it anyway. What a horrible album!! This isn't rap!! Where are the phat beats, lyrics about girls, money and killing, computerized vocals and MTV music videos? Needless to say, I'm never listening to this again! Stick to 50 Cent, Lil Wayne, T-Pain, Akon and Kanye West instead."
1,"Abstract, big words doesn't equal hot","To Quote my fav emcee, ""There's abstract hip-hop that I think is not hot. People just rambling with big words on the microphone that really don't say anything."" Can't say it any better."
4,MF does it once again,What can I say this is the best I have picked up since MF's Viktor Vaughn cd. Mablibs beats blend excellent with Doom's rhymes. I would of given this cd 5 stars but it is a short cd with songs averaging 2 two and half mins. The other reason I didnt give this cd 5 stars MF isnt on every song. He really outshines every other rappper on this cd. So when you hear the songs he's not dropping rhymes on you sit there wishing you were hearing Doom flow. This is a great cd and well worth picking up. It will tie you over until later this year when Doom drops his much anticipated follow up to operation doomsday!!!!!
3,Fair performances,"Daniel Barenboim, although he is popular, he is just a fair piano performer. I've heard amateurs play better. I am still in search of an excellent performance of liszt's consolations, but for now, daniel barenboim will have to do. since i do not highly recommend his performances, you can just pick anyone for these performances, i am not aware of anyone who can play these really well. however, sylvia capova does liszt's consolation no. 3 excellent. too bad she doesn't play the other 5. :)"
5,Awesome !!!!!!,Santa brought this to my 9 year old for Christmas and he absolutely loved it. It is a very functional and nice looking set and the quality is excellent. Nice job Santa!
5,Thank you for letting me Know I have not been alone,"I have been there and felt it all. I thought I was the only one!Now I know others have been there too and I am not alonethank you so much for your fantastic honesty, and for telling people it is possible to find out Life Begins when you Let GoLynn Grocott Author of Cut the Strings a true story of a soul reclaimed."
3,Redundant information,"Quick read, small bookAuthor makes case for accepting oneself ""as is"" in this case no matter what person's weight is and life not starting 5 lbs from now then later going back and saying the opposite--feeling better once goal weight or weight they are comfortable withSome good points made in the book but find it difficult to tell people I converse with to stop talking about weight even though it may annoy me"
5,Wow!,"I keep looking for books like this and now I've found the perfect one! Jessica's got me saying things like ""fat is not a feeling"" everytime one of my friends starts to complain about her weight. She wrote about things I have only thought but never said outloud. A very forward thinking, funny, heartfelt book. I highly recommend it for every woman in your life!"
4,Incredibly helpful and engaging,"Jessica's first book was wonderful but this one is even better. She wrestles with very real topics in a smart, fun and, most importantly, useful way. I can think of six people I want to give this to as a gift/hint."
1,Really Bad!,I thought this was really boring. It wasn't fun at all. Of course than again I don't play basketball and am not a fan of basketball. Maybe in order to like it is to be a basketball player or a basketball fan.
4,Get this for the outstanding Luonnotar,"The BIS Sibelius Edition has superior recordings of many of the performances found on these discs, but not overwhelmingly so. However, the performance here of Luonnatar with Gwyneth Jones is my favorite, actually the only one I really like, preferable to the Phyllis Curtin-Bernstein/Sony and Vanska/BIS performances, and motivated my own purchase. A singular opus, Luonnotar springs from the epic declamatory muse of the Kalevala and is a composition that comes out of nowhere, seemingly without precedent and without sequel in his own ouevre. Sometimes one wishes that Sibelius had not been so determinedly original and followed further the paths he blazed."
5,Beyond the Symphony,"If you bought Sibelius symphony discs, one of them probably included Finlandia (also on this disc). The collection here is a survey of the remaining works, with emphasis on Tone Poems. Some of these works are difficult to find on the discs they came from. All the different orchestras are fine here. I love the Pohjola with Malcolm Sargent. I have about five other versions to compare to.The second disc ends with four pieces for singer and piano. That is all you get for chamber size works.All in all you can play both discs beginning to end. The only famous piece missing is Valse Triste.Of all the old recordings, this one and some of Karajan stand up well next to modern recordings by Vänskä and Järvi."
1,A parody of an Atlantis book,"Except for brief passages, this book only contains the same text as in Plato's original account, retold. Some errors make it obvious that it is not intended to be taken serious. For instance, 3000 stadia is translated to 330 miles, but 2000 stadia become 110 miles. Not even the worst idiot could make such a mistake, so it must be a parody. However, as a parody it is worthless, lacking all humor."
2,"not clear,not to much tables and very unclear","whith this price i expected more detail,more clear tables and much more a HANDBOOK whith answers and details of stations and calculation. its look like he tooks some tables frome another book and put alot of words to fill the book"
4,Extraordinary photos of variety of landscape in Iowa,"The photographs in this book are extraordinary - pictures that represent the real beauty of the state of Iowa. The landscape varies from the 500 foot bluffs over the Mississippi River, tall hills and deep valleys, beautiful autumn colors; to the expected rolling hills of Grant Wood and the big sky over the prairies of tall grass. There is so much variety in Iowa, which this book captures in color-saturated photographs. My only consideration is I wish that there was more description of the places which are pictured. Photographs are either identified briefly by their titles, or not at all."
5,What God can do with Everyday People,"Janet has written a wonderful, practical book that has initial appeal because it instructs us how to combine things in our life that we want to do (in this case exercise and praying). The book goes far beyond the how to get more things done in your day. The book is a journey that shows how daily praying can affect Christian growth, attitude and strength. The book needs to be read slowly to allow the reader time to meditate over what is being said. Janet allows the reader into her and her family's everyday life to show that everyday people are capable of great communication with God and the affect that it can have on our lives."
5,Grand slam,Grand slam 97 isn't much on features like graphics. But it is a fun and simple game which is nice change from the glitzy Nintendo and Playstation games big on graphics and cinimatic hype. It is a unique game that is my favorite sports game and has been since it came out in 1997. Virgin should do a Grand Slam 2002
4,Underworld Michael,Hard to find! Item no longer in production. From the original movie this has been out of production for years.
5,This book is wonderful for anyone seeking inner peace.,The Tao of Inner Peace takes a subject which is not easily explained and dismantles it for the common man. THe lay person can read Tao of Inner Peace and come to understand difficult concepts that are usually overlooked by Taoist authors.You are litterally guided by the hand through the everyday practices of a Taoist.. and given accurate descriptions as to why those rites are necessary. This book is a must have for people of every religion or walk of life
1,A paradox,"The author uses her own version of the Tao, which is very unorthodox, if not incorrect at times. Where the Tao gives general principles for living a happy life, Diane tries to force the Tao into something she wants it to be: A guide to inner strength and world peace. It seems that Diane is trying to knock out her own insecurity rather to help the reader. The book may reveal a way to inner and world peace, but it is not in line with the Tao."
4,"Better then Volume one, but still doesn't show THE BEST","I just purchased this video today at suncoast and it has its ups and downs. The main reason i got this is because there is stuff on this tape that you won't find anywhere else, even on wwf videos. The highlights are clearly ""Mankind Vs The Rock"" in Dec 98 in which mankind wins his first ever wwf title(with a little help from stone cold) you can't find this match anywhere and the crowd goes absolutely nuts when austins music hits. Other highlights include HHH's first wwf title win, hilarious vootage of Vince being trained by shane, and the beginning of the mcmahon helmsley era. the rest of the video tends to show the worst of raw, which includes a date with mark henry and china. However this video is a good value for under 15 bucks. its about 2 hours and at least 45 minutes of it is really good. If you want to see hunter and mick win their first ever wwf titles then get this video, it is well worth it."
5,Great,"My girlfriend totally loved this ring, 5 star, shipping was fast and she got it at the right time."
3,promises,it's ok. shipping was fast. almost what I expected it to look like. I'm not a big fan of white gold.
5,Great drive. Don't know what the other reviewers are talking about.,I've used this drive for a year now. I own both the firewire and USB version. Love them both. No problems whatsoever. I do think the Firewire one is just a bit quicker.
2,My sister had a stem cell transplant,"I was my sisters caregiver when she had a stem cell transplant for ovarian cancer and the family was given this book from the hospital to read. The book really did not go into enough depth on the reality of the transplant and what to expect from it for the patient and the family. My seventy five year old mother had trouble understanding it. I felt this book was ""sugar coating"" what really happens physically and emotionally to the patient, caregiver and family members."
5,"A meal of treasure, offered in bit size nuggets.","A must read for those who want the richness of the classics but don't have the time to go searching these depths. This author has dug up nuggets from past saints and offers them on a silver plater. I have so enjoyed the ""Rekindling the Inner Fire"" series and bless God that the treasures of these saint's experience with our Eternal Lover have not been lost beneath dust and banished to back of our libraries. I recommend all of these books from John of the Cross to Andrew Murray and all those in between."
5,Timeless,"I have used this for personal retreats and for Lent. My experience of this tool changes with each circumstance, it has helped me grow and the beauty of John of the Cross becomes richer and richer."
1,These pens were dried up and didn't work!,These pens were dried up when I received them.....they may have been fun if they had worked. I did try dipping their pen tips in water (several times)to try and get them to work. However all I could get was a pale line of a single letter. Not worth the money it cost to have these pens shipped here.
3,Great fun for a short time,This is an amazing pen. It's fun and fascinating--for a short time. It dries up very quickly and then the fun is gone. I bought four of these pens and three of them dried up after only about four or five uses. I have extended the life some by adding water to the body of the pen. That has seemed to rejuvenate them.
4,Good,The products that I purchased were mostly good. One pen was dry. The kids loved the pens and had a great time being detectives and using the pens for clues.
5,FANSTASTIC!!!!!,This book was absolutely AWESOME!! I was hooked from the first few lines. I read all 300+ pages in 2 days. I couldn't put it down and when I did all I could do was think about the characters and what was going to happen next. If you like suspenseful books you will not be disappointed!! I cannot wait for Matthew Farrell's next novel.
3,Loved it!,"I bought this toy for my husband, he wanted it as a child and he was so happy when it arrived. I bought the toy because it said it was ""mint condition"". I was upset when my husband told me that the box was opened and looked as if it had been used. Still, he was thrilled I purchased it for him. He isn't allowed to play with it, but I'm so happy he considered it ""the best gift"" I ever got him."
3,nice Collectible,"So I got the Toy in the mail, it was packaged pretty good I guess, all the electronics work great on it, although when it did come in it was also missing its batter cover, but I managed to use something in place of it so its not noticeable from a far, other than that its still a pretty cool toy for any oldschool 90's power Ranger fan..Hard to find Item too."
3,an original power rangers weapon,When i got this finialy i started to mess with the sound buttons i think it was played with until the sound was kinda mess up but at least its is a cool toy
2,AAHH !,"This F.O.D. isn't like the earlier films in the 80's.This film includes four stories that I seen on reality TV shows.I felt like everything I seen on this DVD ,I seen or heard about it either on the NEWS or the History Channel.So I guess this film isn't as grossed out or crazier than any other FOD movies.But they do show a 1947 Alien Autopsy being done ? was it real ?"
4,"Good phone, good service","Guys who were bashing T-Mobile are probably under ""commercial influence"". Verizon is not much better provider, so its coverage in corn fields of Illionois is better I must admit. In all other respects T-Mobile is doing what it promises. It's affordable, GSM (which is a huge plus if you're a frequent traveller), good customer support etc. Besides, T-Mobile is using Cingular/AT&T; network in most western states. So those who said that Cingular has better coverage were not correct. There's only problem with 1800 GSM is that uses too short wave length which has less building penetratino power than CDMA phones. Let's say big thank you to US government for that.And the person who said that he knows internal of that phone... Hm... even if he's working in Motorola, he's a hypocrat because design of this phone was done by an OEM partner of Motorola. Few engineers there really know how it works. :)"
4,Great phone,"This is a great phone. I've had it for a little over a week now, and I love it. The only reason it gets four instead of five stars is the lack of a memory card slot. On the other hand, I have pics and voice tags for nearly every entry in my phonebook, and only 10% of the memory is being used."
2,I HATE this phone,"I've owned maybe 20 cell phones over the past 15 years.The GOOD news about the RAZR?- It's small and light and you barely feel it in your pocket.The BAD news about the RAZR.- EVERYTHING else. Scrolling, sound quality, visability, ease of use. It's just a piece of junk."
3,Good but has an annoying problem for me,Got this phone about 2 months ago. It has recently started emitting a quiet high pitched whine where you normally have your ear when making calls when the phone is open (and the screen on) as well as a low buzzing noise from the area where you speak into the phone. I had heard about this problem before and I'm not sure if motorola will fix this but I will try to send it in soon. The phone itself works great and the noises are annoying but everything still functions perfectly.
3,"For me, flaws were bigger than its beauty","Yes, this phone is beautiful. It will impress all of your friends. It has some wonderful features mentioned by other reviewers. But three things led to my decision to trade it in for a Nokia.1. Remember how old ""cordless phones"" used to buzz? Well, this phone buzzed. I have seen that other Razr users have stated the same thing.2. This phone is so thin that for me, it was just too thin. I like to hold my phone and dial all in one hand (just like most people do). This was not easy to do or comfortable with the large flat design of the phone.3. Finally, there is no external antenna. It is actually in the bottom of the phone, so I am told. For me, living in a more rural area, this cut down on reception greatly."
2,DUST under the screen!,"OK, if you keep this phone in your pocket, you WILL get lint and dust UNDER the screen. And there's NO WAY to clean it out.I've had my phone for 5 weeks and I started noticing dust on the screen that I couldn't clean off. That's when I noticed that the dust was under the screen, not on it. So I took it to a Cingular store and they said, ""Oh, well just thump the screen until the dust falls to the bottom."" Um... what? And then they said, ""Or, just don't carry it in your pocket.""That was it. That's their answer to this problem. Thump the screen. (it doesn't work, btw. the static on the inside of the screen holds the dust like a magnet.)Oh, and if you google ""Dust inside razor phone screen,"" you'll see that lots and lots and lots of people have this problem.Oh yeah, one more thing, Motorola will NOT fix the phone for you. Neither will Cingular. Even if you have insurance. They say it's your problem, not a phone problem."
4,Very Compact phone without any frills,Love this phone. Does what a phone has to without any extra frills. The battery life with blue tooth enabled is pretty poor. Love the compact size. Pretty sturdy build too.
4,Good Phone,"I have had this phone for a month now and find it to be reliable. The only thing I find odd is that the ringtones mysteriously change at times. A few of my friends have also complained about the same issue. Other than that, I am glad I purchased it."
1,Too bad there is nothing lower than 1 star,"I switched to this phone after being assured I would have at least the same reception as my previous phone. The RAZR turns out to have extremely poor reception. Verizon Techs have admitted to me that the antennae in the handset just doesn't pick up well. What has Verizon Wireless told me about this problem resulting in dropped calls, delayed voice message alerts and poor signal reception? Just that I have passed the worry free 15 day return period so my only option is ""full retail"" replacement. Thanks Verizon!"
2,Disappointment,"Overall the phone isn't too bad...BUT...the volume is horrible. If the phone isn't positioned just right over the ear, you can't hear squat. The features are cool, but if I can't hear the other person, what good is the phone?"
2,Worst phone I've ever owned.,"I only have 70% hearing in both of my ears and am regretting not doing more research prior to buying this stupid RAZR. Unless I am in my car with the radio off or in my house, I don't even bother answering my phone. I can't use it on the trains to and from work, outside of my building near the somewhat-busy Chicago streets, or pretty much anywhere else.If you want a phone that you can HEAR the people you are talking to: DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!"
4,Looks good... Works not so good!,I love the look of the phone as does everyone else. However the phone does buzz occasionally. Also It is complicated to get to the Video Recording... I still don't know how to do it and if you even can like they state you can. It rings extremely loud which is a plus. I get mediocre reception in rural areas where with past phones that weren't motorola I got excellent reception. Motorla should reconsider a few things with the Razor and it would be a great phone.
1,3 batteries in 5 months - Poor Performance,"I purchased this phone in the middle of January 2006 and have had nothing but issues. At first, my phone just proceded to turn itself on and off as it pleased, wherever I was and whatever time it happened to be. I had enough of this towards the end of March and spoke with a T-mobile representative who basically told me it was a design flaw with the phone and he would send me a slightly larger battery which will solve the problem.We'll I received the battery the last week of March and as of yesterday, my phone won't even take a charge. I spoke with T-mobile again this morning and got nowhere. They told me it was a design flaw again and they would send another battery.I would not recommend this phone. I know other people (including my best friend) who have had this issue over the past few months with the Razr V3 (2 of which have it through Cingular, not T-mobile as I do). I will defintiely not purchase another razr or uprgraded version of this phone again."
2,"Thin is in, but fat's where it's at!","This phone has terrible battery life, a big sacrifice for the thin profile. I've actually tried two RAZR's thinking the first was defective because it was unable to get me through the day. The second was the same. What good is a phone that must be tethered to the recharger most of the time? I traded the RAZR for a pudgy Samsung SCH-a950. Not as stylish, but so far the battery life has been great! The RAZR does have a huge display and some nice features. If they could only fix the battery problem!"
3,Great when bought,It was a good phone for the first year but the service I got is terrible in my house. I have to go outside to send texts.
1,Razer hell,"Used this phone, it crashed then got a new one from Cingular and the new one fell apart one night out partying. Dropped more calls than a leaky bucket...if you are a poser then I guess this is should go well with your LA gear sneakers....k"
3,It only fancy.,"The volume is low and there is no catogary to store Home, Office and Mobile numbers by itself."
2,Good only for one year,I have seen this problem with 2 Razor that we own & also the ones my friends own. It is good for the first year & after that the battery does not stay for more than one day. 3-4 calls in a day & the battery is dead.
1,"Look cool, while sounding like you're deaf","Great phone if you are looking for a sleek, stylish model that looks good on your ear. HOWEVER, if you want to make a phone call then you might want to consider another phone."
3,too late and too expensive,It comes too late and Cingular have already offered it for free for 2 years contract. Unless you like the phone + service from T-mobile.
2,Motorola Razr,"Battery life sucks ,just for two days even if u don talk on phone.If u try to play games on it , battery dies out within 20 minutes even if it is fully charged."
2,"Displaying ""unknown call"" for incoming calls","I got Motorola Razor V3 phone from T-Mobile couple of days back. I noticed that when somebody calls me, I get ""unknown call"" on my cell phone display instead caller's phone number. I know the caller's phone number is not blocked.When I called t-mobile customer service, he is saying that this is known issue and he is going to let me know the fix for it in couple of days.Has anyone noticed this problem ? If so, how did they fix it. Do I need to change any settings ?"
1,Just absolutely awful,"I have owned Motorola phones in the past and they've all been terrible. I knew I shouldn't have gotten the Razr, but it was a special deal and I had lost my good Samsung phone. So, I got suckered in.Looks great, performs horribly.1. The camera stopped working inside of a few days and all the pics came out as a blurred mess.2. Reception was horrible, and I've never had reception probs with T-mobile.3. Sound quality is terrible. I couldn't understand people. Think of the teacher from Charlie Brown. (Muaa waa wa waaaa waa)4. It says you have 4 new messages when there is only one.5. The response time when you press a button is up to two seconds.6. The volume knob is in a bizarre, hard to get to place in the upper part of the flip.Do yourself a favor and say as far away from any Motorola product as possible, and if you get suckered in... you'd BETTER buy the insurance plan, because it's not if.. .it's when. (For me, it lasted about 2 months before completely falling apart.)"
1,do not buy this phone!,"This phone is clearly a marketing gimmick. The worst reception ever on a cell phone. I have had other phones(all Nokias)that did not have all the bells and whistles of this phone, but I actually received phone calls. If you live in an area that does not have the greatest reception, you will really regret this purchase. I hope I save one poor soul from this phone."
2,"Thin, but large in other dimensions","The Razr phone is a great marketing blitz. It's about as thin as a PDA, but not quite. It's actually thicker than my palm pilot. But the RAZR is also about the same SIZE (height/width) as my PDA. So if you want to carry around a slightly thicker version of your PDA and call it a phone, then the RAZR is the phone for you. Otherwise I strongly recommend looking at other phones, such as the Samsung 335, which easily slips into your pocket without being noticed."
1,T-Mobile,"I have had my RAZR for about six months now and won't elaborate on the positive and negative aspects of the phone, as that has been accomplished in other reviews.However, my experience with T-Mobile as a carrier has been awful, and worth noting here. I have had numerous issues with billing and statements--which is fine (to be expected in this industry), but the customer service reps are so offensive and accusatory, it makes me not want to call when I have questions. Perhaps that is T-Mobile's intent, in an attempt to reduce calls, but as a customer in good standing, I would expect Customer Service to be more open and available to questions--especially when, in many instances, upon closer inspection, their billing statement was shown to be erroneous.Put simply, T-Mobile's customer service is frustrating to work with--and when you are locking yourself into a contract for a year, that is not comforting at all."
4,"This is cool as all, but not perfect","I use the Tmobile service in the DC/Balt area, and the service is really good.The phone is cool. However, its operating system is kinda weird. It just does not feel like the GUI on the old Sprints I am used to using. The ""back"" key feels out of place. The menus do not feel as intuitive. The VGA camera is useless. The video feature is fine, though. I would like the ability to associate pics with incoming calls but maybe I am ignorant.The phone feels fine in my hands. The keys feel ok, not as bad as some would make you think.But it looks cool, feels cool, sounds good, and I like it. I don't really expect my cell phone to replace my laptop or do whatever else the technorati want."
2,fancy phone but not good,"I've own this phone for 2 months and felt quite disappointed. The phone looks beauty and cool. However, since it is too thin and wide, the feeling in hand is not so good. As everybody knows, the battery sucks. With wired ear bud, it may support talk time from 2 hours to 3 hours at most. But with bluetooth ear bud, most of the time, it can only have 1.5-hour talk time. But when you use BT ear bud, the phone automatically disable all the customized the ring tones, so that you have no way to know who's calling you from the ring tones. The only good thing of this model over my old V300 cell phone is the mini USB port which let me easily download/upload pictures and ring tones from my computer. But the software is not come with the phone. Same as V300, you still have to buy the software. Luckily, you save the money for the data cable, if you have a digital camera or camcorder which uses the same mini USB cable."
3,Sleak Design but poor voice quality,"I bought this phone two months ago, phone looks very nice but the voice quality is very poor, voice clarity is good with Head phones, Earlier I had a V300 phone, compared to it most of the features and menus are same, except it has a bluetooth. The battery life comes a maximum of three days. It can not be charged while using head phones and viceversa because it has common socket for both."
4,New phone after Ericsson,"I have had the phone for a month and like it. The reception is much better, the signal does not break anymore in the places it used to. The design is neat, both front panel and overall size. I use holster to carry it and does not take much space. I have an Ericsson bluetooth headset and the volume is so high that I keep both the phone and the headset at their minimum. The speaker is also very loud, I have to lower the volume after switching to it.What it lacks in comparison with Ericsson is convenience of voice labels: each label is individual, so I have to invent different labels for cell phones of my friends (for Ericsson I had to say friend's name and 2 seconds later - one of three words: ""home"" or ""work"" or ""mobile""). I also miss the button ""C"" - Delete from Ericsson, I think Motorola's navigation is not that convenient. A tool to write melodies would not hurt as well, for now I have to write melodies on Ericsson-68i and pass them to RAZR through bluetooth."
2,overrated,"I got this phone when it first came out. Yes I still have it and it still does work but...it needs too many changes to be a good phone. The battery life is horrible and I only get a few days out of it. If I am using the camera the battery dies WAY too fast. The keypad is just too small for texting. My daughter has the same phone and I've noticed our reception is very different. Sometimes she can get service but I can't or vice versa. If and when I get another phone, I will get something better next time and not go with a fashion trend."
1,Do not buy this telephone,"I bought my first RAZR in April 2005, and after ten days it completely stopped working. The supplier happily provided me with a replacement, but I am completely unimpressed. I bought it for its Internet capability, but it is unbelievably slow, and essentially useless for things like checking email. The sound quality is very bad; I strain to hear my callers constantly. The inside screen is impossible to see in anything but low light, gets gummed up easily, and the keypad is practically invisible unless you're shining a bright light on it (which makes it impossible to see the screen)! It randomly turns itself off. You can only store the last 10 calls received, instead of the 30+ my old lower-tech phone could. There's a reason why these phones are now being discounted and offered in special deals."
2,Looks aren't everything.....,"I bought the razr with having only looked at it online. It looks great and has several really neat features. But looks aren't everything! If you don't hold the phone just right (and not where it is comfortable) you can't hear the other person at all. Also, the buttons are flush with the phone which makes it very easy to mis-type a number or type something out of whack when sending a text. I am not overly impressed with this phone."
3,Um......,"I have one of these phones, and at first loved it. Than after a while, I started to loathe it. It's too skinny, and being an avid texter, I hate typing messages on the flat keyboard. I guess that I am biased towards black-berry type phones, but it's not as flashy as it seems. (By the way, I am 12, on my dads review. NOT AS COOL AS IT SEEMS.)"
3,It's okay,"Phone looks good, has a good battery life, and the reception is good. The phone itself is very strong and sturdy (as sturdy as a half an inch piece of technology could ever expect to be). On the bad side, the ear piece volume is poor. After about a year my # and 9 key quite working. I have heard similar stories about the key functions, lights, etc. not working after some time, however most of these phones only have a shelf life of one to two years."
3,Motorola RAZR V3 Phone,the phone is nice but i can never get much service in doors. i've hade the phone for a while and still have a hard time finding what i need to get to.
2,BEWARE of Amazon Rebate!,"I'm happy I finally made the switch from my 5 year old Samsung SCH 8500. I have just one complaint about the instrument - even at max volume, I can't hear too well in loud/crowded places. But my biggest complaint is that I never did receive the rebate from Amazon. I bought this phone in December 2005 and signed up for a 1-year contract with T-Mobile. I got an email in April saying that my submission for a rebated had been validated. I've tried emailing Amazon from the rebate website and also tried calling the toll free number several times. I now get a message that my rebate number is 'not valid'. Needless to say, I feel robbed. I'd much rather have stayed with Sprint (who I found to be much better than T-Mobile) and got the new Samsung phone that they started offering in February!"
2,broken heart,"I was pretty excited to get my new Razr - I was going to be a tech leader! It is cool, light, easy to carry in a pocket, and has lots of neat features that I don't really use. Then, 2 months later, it stopped working - I think the software had a problem and it would not start up. Cingular got right on it and sent a replacement. Then 2 months later, the replacement phone's keypad stopped working. Again, Cingular is sending a second replacement. I am so sad. I am going to give the 2nd replacement a try, but if it goes bad, I am going to have to change phones. I am not tied to my phone, but being without it for a week every other month is a bit much."
2,ear volume is too low,"The 8-year old Qualcomm which my new Razr replaces has much better call reception than this clunker. I work in NYC, and I need good volume on the earpiece. The Razr volume is too low, and it wavers in and out. The voice reception is often distorted, even a block from my office, I can't hear my own secretary. The placement of the phone against the ear is uncomfortable, and even after two weeks of use, I still have trouble finding the ""sweet spot"" where volume is going straight into my ear. My hand makes mini circles left right, up down. Useless.Beautful things don't have to work, just look at Melania Trump. But a PHONE has to have AUDIO competence. I refuse to reward Motorola or T-Mobile for failing the 1st function of a phone. I'm taking it back and spending the $100 bucks on a bracelet which will also look beautiful without the headache."
2,Nothing special,"I've had this phone for about a week after upgrading from a Samsung E105. I really can't see any features this phone has over that phone except for BlueTooth and the camera. It's thin, but bigger footprint and doesn't seem very durable. For the price, I'd say it's not worth it. May return it for one of T-Mobile's free Samsung phones."
2,yuk!,"i dont know why people like this phone so much. looks arent every thing!! i might be slim, but itz WIDE!!!! it broke so easily, it fell of my bed and broke of my carpet!! try the audiovox 8915snapper prepaid phone from virgin mobile, or thenokia 6101 tmo to go prepaid phone from t-mobile, or the nokia n90. i gave it 2 stars, 1 for being slim (itz still wide!!) and one because u could call on it.i still dont know y u people like it so much.>=("
1,The Razr and T-Mobile = Bad Combination,"The Razr is a nice phone though it is very delicate and breaks easily. Motorola makes great phones. The phone would be great if it was stronger, but its only good feature is its slimness.Next is T-Mobile. Their network is very small. Good luck getting signal, I had T-Mobile service for about 2 days and I dumped it because I could not get any service at my house. If you really want the Razr then get it from Verizon Wireless. They have the Best service in the cell phone industry. I get full bars where people with T-Mobile, Nextel, and Cingular have none. I had Cingular before also and I would drop calls almost every time I was on the phone. With Verizon I rarely drop calls its great. Though I still would recommend a different phone than the Razr."
3,Alright,So far the phone seems to be alright. I just switched from Nextel so anything is an improvement! I have dropped it a few times and it is still working fine.
1,05/14/2007 - This phone sucks!,"Too bad I had to give this phone 1 star. Amazon should change that so users can give it NO stars. Read on.After owning three (3) RAZR phones in 3 months, I gave up. Good news was that Cingular was very nice each and every time I had to do an exchange. It was no hassle and very easy. But this review isn't about Cingular. It's about Motorola and that waste of a phone they call RAZR. Dust under the view screen was a problem. Low, low, low volume was a BIG problem. Dropped calls. Slow and sluggish command responses. I also bought the software to make my own ring tones and sync up with Outlook, but the software was quirky and had a mind of its own too.I rarely write reviews, but am compeled to urge you NOT to buy the RAZR. The one I own now (thanks to Cingular) is the Sony W600, and have no regrets. No dust. Good volume. No dropped calls. Software works like it's supposed to. Fast command response. No worries."
4,"Still ""THE"" phone to get.","RAZR is the phone to get if you are into 'form and function'. I have the first generation one from T-Mobile and my only problem is the camera resolution, its very low. Bluetooth is great, connect with the car (BMW) and headset (Sony) with no problems. Speaker phone is a must if you have young kids."
1,BUYER BEWARE,"This is the worst cell phone i have EVER had. Immediately I heard an annoying buzzing noise when phone was opened. Also, while talking I hear a sound like a teapot boiling. The volume SUCKS! Even at it's loudest, it is sometimes hard to hear. Missed calls aren't always reflected on outter screen. STAY AWAY!!!! DON'T BUY THIS PHONE!!! BUY A SAMSUNG!!!"
1,if there was a 0 star rating........,if there was a 0 star rating then this phone would get a 0. it breaks so easily.could be lost easliy.looks cool but it is very bad. please do not get this phone.
2,T-Mobile and Motorola Bad,"My wife has had not the RAZR phone but another Motorola phone with T-mobile for over a year now. All I can say is that when the phone was NEW, the T-mobile service is VERY spotty and unreliable. I have Verizon and it worked much better. Anyway... After a year, the headset jack in her motorola phone is loose and doesn't work with headsets anymore. In addition, her calls last about 30 seconds before getting dropped now. Obviously something wrong with the phone. In my experience Motorola doesn't make very reliable cell phones. We have had 3 different models of Samsung cell phones in the past and they are rock solid, durable, and reliable. Not sure why Motorola can't get with the program. So we just terminated T-mobile service, got her a Samsung phone (SCH-A630) through Verizon and SHE IS VERY HAPPY!"
1,T- Mobile service SUCKS,"I bought this phone and Plan as the deal was too good to resist.Now I am not able to receive calls from some service providers, they get a voice message "" This number is temporarily out of service"".I called T-mobile customer service 3 times and after being put on hold for more than 30 min finally was able to reach Tech support. He tried everything and in the end said that they cannot help me [if tech support cannot then who can???]. Now I have been asked to go to a T-Mobile store and they MAY be able to help me.When I ask to talk to a supervisor, I was transferred to a number which was playing the message ""The Number you have reached is incorrect"" ha ha ha how funny.Will never take T-mobile service ever."
1,Get your RAZR (but not from T-Mobile),"This wonderful phone is available in black from Cingular and the RAZR will be available soon from Verizon - think twice before you use T-Mobile. A previous post is correct - the network is much more important than the phone.Also, buy your phone directly from a storefront that is run by Cingular or Verizon - never buy from an ""authorized reseller"" or even on the Cingular, Verizon (or T-Mobile) web sites. If you phone service is important to you, get it from a store that you trust in your neighborhood!"
4,Natalietb,"GREAT PHONE! Only 1 problem: Volume is too low. Otherwise, best phone I have ever owned!! I bought a leather cover for it, but removed it, as it was covering the earpiece. Volume now is much better, but still not the greatest. Great photo quality, and big, easy keyboard to read. Good-looking too!!"
3,don't see what the big hype is all about...,"I just bought this phone a wk ago and so far, I just don't see what the big hype was all about. The phone LOOKS cool, colors are vivid, but other than that, there's nothing else to really get excited about. The volume is really low, even when I've maxed it out. I've heard a humming noise when I use the phone, the phone book is a pain in the *** to deal with, and earlier today, it froze on me while i was using the web features. I got a good deal on the phone, so at least I didn't spend as much as others did. With my previous Samsung & Sanyo phones, I never had to enter any name in the phone book more than once even for multiple #'s or entries, which isn't the case w/ this razr. I have yet to experience the other probs that everyone talks about..."
3,overrated trend,"I wanted this phone sooo badly for sooo long. I finally got it and it's really nothing that special. Just another cell phone - but it looks really cool. If you can find it cheap, go for it. Otherwise don't be like me and give into trendiness...ugh! I kinda miss my old Samsung.RE: the majority of the other reviewsReview the PHONE, not TMobile. Half of you don't even own this phone, you're just looking for a place to complain about your service with them. It's annoying."
2,Don't Buy Razor v3 from T-Mobile - It is CRIPPLED,T-Mobile is crippling their Razor V3 - they are intentionally disabling the e-mail client that is built-in to the phone.
1,Not enough memory!,"What's good for with all that mp3 ring tone, 4X zone-in camer, but only 6M memory to storage it? I put one song in it and 3M is gone. This phone does not have slot for any memory card! No expension ability at all!"
1,Quality is horrible!,My family got three new RAZR phones in Nov 2005. So far all of them have been replaced at least once under warranty service (one as many as three times!). Not sure why these phones are still on the market or how Motorola is still in business - they all have bad batteries that last 6 months or less. To have to replace the phones so often for defects blows me away. Someone needs to file a class-action lawsuit against Motorola - it costs me shipping and handling each time I have to replace the phone (hint hint any lawyers out there)!
4,Like talkin' on a graham cracker!,"My husband has this phone. It has better reception, in our living room anyways, than my beloved Motorola V300. The camera and video are wicked! I also love the Bluetooth. Since my V300 doesn't have bluetooth capability or video, I'm interested in upgrading. The RAZR would be the perfect phone for me, but it's too darn wide! It's like a graham cracker before you break it into quarters. That's how it feels to me. Hubby says it's perfect for him cos his hands n' fingers are big. With smaller phones, he'd always misdial cos the keys were too close together for him. The RAZR seems to be a good phone. I don't hear hubby complain much about it. It's just to wide for my dainty, little hands."
1,"TROUBLE,TROUBLE,TROUBLE","This phone is nothing but trouble, yes it is stylish but it is not a good phone. I don't have the problem with the battery that another person mentioned however my display keeps messing up, even going away. I take excellent care of my phone, I never let my daughter play with it , I'm the only one who uses it. I have only had it about 3 months and have already had to replace it once and now I need another replacement. T-Mobile must be having problems with the phone also because it is no longer listed for sale on their web-site. All I can do is give you my advice....Buy a different phone!!!"
2,Not A Great Buy,"Less than a month old, battery died. Will be sending for replacement. Already bought cheapest available unloacked phone as backup! Looks good in hand. Not too great features either."
2,Current T-mobile users BEWARE,"Don't fall into this promotional/rebate trap. T-mobile has been my carrier for the last 3 years. I figured, what a great time to renew my contract, and get the groovy new RAZR at the same time (essentially free after Amazons $200 promotional credit). I followed the online instructions about transferring existing phone number- I odered the new phone online, it arrived pre-activated with a new cell number. I then called T-mobile to cancel my old line and transfer the number to the new phone. ""Impossible"" they tell me. To keep me happy however, T-mobile cancels my new account and simply renews my old account for another year. T-mobile tells me this is an error on Amazons part and that I should still be eligible for the promotional credit. [...]"
2,All hype,"We are very disapointed with this phone. In March, 2006 we switched over to T-Mobile service, got three phones, two were RAZR V3's. The problem, NO SERVICE in any commercial building. If it were just one of the RAZR phones we would have it checked out, but both phones DO NOT WORK inside buildings. We have trouble at times getting service in our own house.We had talked to several people who use T-Mobile and were impressed by the package and service available so we switched. None of those people have a RAZR phone, and none have any problems with reception anywhere. The third phone on our plan (Samsung), has no difficulty getting reception.Don't waste your money on this phone or at the very least, don't plan on using it inside."
3,There's a potential dealbreaker about this phone,"The RAZR is a stylish phone, and the price seems right, and most of the features are okay. Bluetooth was a biggie for me, and this phone seems to perform fine. There is, however, one MAJOR flaw - which is not documented anywhere. The capacity for SMS messages is fixed - it is not calculated from the memory of the machine (which at 5 megs should be plenty) - rather, it is hardwired. My phone maxes out at 30 SMS messages. That's it. You have to start deleting after that. I had to call Motorola and speak with an engineer to learn about this ""feature"". So, if text messaging is important to you (and is the major reasoning behind my getting a new phone), be aware of this limitation."
4,"beautiful phone, only fair battery life","i bought the razr after reading the helpful reviews here [...]. i've had it for 2 months and overall it has performed well. in response to some of the concerns voiced in previous reviews, here are my particular likes and dislikes...likes:- great-looking shape and exterior finish- no problems with durability so far- mp3 ringtones- camera and video recorder- t-mobile service in san francisco (better than cingular)dislikes:- battery life (only 48-72 hrs on standby)- one software glitch after trying to customize the screen saver with a photo-->resolved after restarting the phone"
2,Very disappointing!,"Let me just start by admitting I sure am glad I waited 6 months of owning the Razr v3 before writing a review. I was psyched when I got my new phone in December 2005 that it worked perfectly, it was just as stylish as promised, the screen resolution was (and is) excellent, and it was just great as I was used to the Motorola interface and all its little quirks.However, just six months later, my phone is unusable. Just--out of the blue--the all the keys stop working. Well, correction, one key still works: the power button. I end up having to drag out an old phone to use because--given a few days--the Razr miraculously recovers. However, it is tiresome hauling a back-up phone around!! I don't know what gives, but I'm tired of this little quirk which can be a major problem if I'm faced with an emergency. Overall, a very unstable, disappointing product."
1,T-mobile serice sucks,Do not buy any phone or service from T-mobile. Their network is terrible. It drops your call many times a day. Their customer service is very rude. I would never go with T-mobile
1,BEWARE T- MOBILE SUBSCRIBERS,First i had called up t-mobile and asked about taking phone from amazon ( i already have a t-mobile phone) and asked if i can take a new phone and take a family plan They said YES and told me all the details about it BUT THE THING THEY FORGOT TO MENTION IS THAT I HAD TO EXTEND MY PHONE CONTRACT FOR A YEAR this was told to me when i called up after buying a new phone and was trying to make a family plan.they had told me they were sorry it was their mistake they forgot to tell me BUT THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO ABOUT IT IF I WANT A FAMILY PLAN I HAD TO EXTEND MY CONTRACT THEN THEY SAID THEY WILL COMPENSATE MY UPGRADING MY PHONE AND THE UPGRADE PHONE OFFERED TO ME WAS THE NOKIA FREE PHONE FOR THE OTHER PHONES I HAD TO PAY AROUND 100-150 DOLLERS JUS TO GET A FAMILY PLANabout the phone its pretty good but signal is bad had a few dropped calls sometimes rest all is good
1,Bull Crap Discount,How could this be a discount when tmobile itself is offering the same phone for the same price or less. Thats no discount you have there its (...).
2,Apple computers?,I hate to break it to you as well but apple had nothing to do with this design. Another thing is the fact that apple isnt known for their style and design they are known for the ipod and making the worst posseble computers on the market.I have a few things with this phoneproseasy to navigatelooks coollots of extrasConsbreaks easyeveryone in the united states has one just like itthe buttons/keypad is bad for textingto tell you the truth it gets old to look at because your friend neighbor uncle brother inlaws that guy walking to work and that guy screaming at you has one
1,Good Phone - (...),I would give 4 stars to the phone. I am happy with the phone as well as the customer service for the product. The only thing Razr V3 lacks is a good search capability for the phone database. Else it is very good.(...)
2,Phone's awesome.....T-Mobile customer service sucks,"The shipment arrived on time. The contents were as listed on the website and in good condition. I have no complaints with the phone itself. The rating is low because of t-mobile:- Instructions are incorrect for t-mobile in the package and on the website. Errors in documenting procedures.- Number portability is a pain. It took 2 hrs to get thru to the rep, and then it took 3 days to switch from Cingular to t-mobile while repeatedly calling the rep to find out the ETA. ETA given was always 2 hrs. Liars!!!- Printed manuals have a lot of errors. I guess t-mobile does not have ""quality"" as a selling point."
1,"seems cool, but it isnt","i am a forgiving user and enjoy cool technology. however, this phone has exhausted my patience as has tmobile. i take very good care of my eqiupment (two-year old sunglasses with nary a scratch on the lenses) but have had to replace this phone thrice and am about to replace it a fourth. perhaps i was spoiled by the sony ericsson t616 that i had or perhaps its because motorola is a disaster. other than the t616 i have been a committed customer from the brick phone, through the flip phone, past the v86 all the way to the RAZR (my dad works there so i feel obligated). but i shant buy agayn from motorola or tmobile until they produce a product that, a. doesnt break all the time, b. isnt slow as molasses, c. isnt designed to look cool while functioning poorly (see motorolas enormous recall of the RAZR). sorry, but this phone just plain sucks."
2,Great... When it works,The Razr Phone is great when it works.. but it has a strong tendency to break not shatter but something will happen like the camera will go out. My Razr's Camera stopped working after less than a month of use... pitiful for the cost of this phone. I know that my problem is not an isolated incident because several of my brothers friends have had the exact same problem leading me to say this is unacceptable. If they release a new version i might consider it but for me the Looks of the Razr are not worth the problems it carrys
2,"Cool looking, weak service, weak interface, eternal wait time","First off, Tmobile service is spotty at best. I just cancelled after a couple days because I sounded like I was talking into a tin can (and I live in the Northside of Chicago, not the country). It took 2 wks to get my phone after I ordered it, luckily I didnt keep my old number. You cant store more than one number under a name, the interface is not very user friendly, but it looks really cool."
2,n.g.,my wife and I both bought this telephone six months ago. Nothing but problems. Going back tomorrow
1,"Razr OK, but T-Mobile is weak","I'm sure the Razr is a great phone, but I would caution anyone from getting it with T-Mobile service. I've got it now and there are many times when I've got no service at all and my friends with other carriers have full bars. I've tried to get them to explain why and I get no reaction. So, get the Razr if you want but stay away from T-Mobile until they fix their service problems."
4,functional phone,"(...)The RAZR comes with a USB cable so that you can charge the phone from your computers USB port. (you can also use the same cable to upload pictures from the phone). The charging/data plug on the phone is a mini usb jack.Cingular has very good coverage since it merged with ATT wireless so they have towers everywhere. When I bought this phone from amazon I switched from T-Mobile to cingular because of the coverage in the Northeast US and international rates. Like the ads say, do actually get more bars in more places.(...)"
3,Looks are deceiving ...,"This is just an ""okay"" phone. I was REALLY disappointed with the length of video recording time. I have a Samsung E315 also and I actually prefer THAT phone which easily records about 90 seconds (or longer) of video. You're lucky if you get 3 seconds of video recording time on the RAZR. The pictures, like the other reviewers have stated, are not as crisp as other camera phones. The reception is fine, no complaints on that, but the phone has ""locked"" on me a few times were I can't do anything: turn it off, make a call, etc. I have to take the battery off and put it back on in order to get the phone to work again. Speakerphone is okay. The design is sweet which is why I gave it 3 stars. The displays are huge which I also like. If my Samsung had a speakerphone, I would have never experienced the disappointing features of the RAZR."
1,T-Mobile Service,"The phone maybe fine, but T-Mobile is the worst customer service I have ever come across. They could not get the phone to work, possible a bad sim card, but do charge for the call to the customer service,which was 38 min being on hold and no fix and promises which they did not keep. They also refuse to give any credit for no service or to make up for it in anyway.I have to recommend to stay a way from T-Mobile since they do not want to serve or sell a service that works. A real rip off!"
4,Great flip phone,"PROS: looks great, sounds great, thin but not too small, huge display.CONS: Low battery life, hard to talk on for more than two hours, cumbersome.RECOMMENDATIONS: Get car charger, & get bluetooth hands free set.I hope this review helped."
5,I love this phone!,"This is a very good phone. It's not perfect, but, i've never seen a perfect phone yet. This phone gets close enough! (I paid $270 and extended my contract to get it...so it better be excellent!)I love the look of the phone....i've already gotten ""what's that?"" and other questions like it. It definately grabs attention. I had heard reports that this phone is too wide, however, it fits perfectly in my hands.Plus, if you get it from Tmo, you get video recording(HA HA cingular customers!!)!The only problem i encountered was the volume. It seemed a little low. However, when I used my motorola headset it seemed fine.I say get this phone if you want a cell phone that draws attention(my last phone was a nokia 6800....that drew some attention too, but, not as much as my RAZR), then this is the phone for you!"
2,"Poor reception from T-mobile, 10 calls dropped in a single afternoon",My wife and I bought a T-mobile family plan coming with this phone. Too bad. Calls dropped like hell. Checked the tower map of the network. found several towers in the walking distance. Went to the T-mobile local store and called customer service. No solution! They keep saying that the motorola phones are bad in reception with T-mobile network and suggest us to get a Nokia or Samsung! The only thing good is speak phone...
3,Pretty fancy phone with not much virtues inside,"The phone looks really stylish and the design is OK.bad things:--- Terrible battery life, once it is down, will not let you turn it on before you charge the battery.--- Not good at capture the signal, sound quality not so good--- Photos taken by the camera is a litter bit of greenishSo far, not very like Motorola products, would go for other brands next time"
2,You get what you pay for... and I got this for free.,"OK the good:*I got it for free*It's made mostly of aluminum which is cool*It looks cool*It has a really nice screen on the inside - it's large and the colors are decentThe bad:*It drops calls almost as much as my old Nokia (which was inexpensive compared to the going cost of this RAZR)*I dropped it twice onto pavement and now it resets itself at random. So this is basically my fault, but come on... we all drop our cell phones. They should be able to withstand a couple of drops, especially if it's made out of METAL and not PLASTIC*The camera's resolution is pitiful*The outer screen is unnecessarily tinyBottom line, I expected more from this phone with all the hype from Motorola. But that's what happens when you give in to the media I suppose. If you get this for free then I guess it's OK, but I would never pay for this phone."
2,A bit of a dissapointment,"Sleek looking phone, very confortable to use but definitley a bit of a dissappointment from a use standpoint.Dial out fails when my wifes no-name brand on same serive (cingular) at same location at same time works fine. Not uncommon that it fails to complete a connection even with 3-5 bars of signal streangth.Menue system is ""non-intuitive"" but that seems to be typical of Moto phones compared to others I've had. (granted this is subjective)Camera pics are blurred and again not as good as my wifes off brand. Same pic in the same place at same time.Web browser is one of the bright spots of this phone.Bottom line I probably would not get another no matter how kool it looked."
2,"Donate your money to the ""author!""","I like Stephen Mitchells REAL books very much !Unfortunately this is NOT a real book. It is mostly blank spacewith one quotation per page -- most of which are very, very brief.Many of the quotations are just fine, others seem to have been chosen because they sound wise (but, in fact are not).Spend your money on a nicely bound blank notebook and start copying down the best of the truly wise statements you find in your own reading. You will end up with a much more substantial and substantive collection than Mitchell has provided. He could easily have assembled this ""book"" in one or two hours.For those who never read well-known authors from the various wisdom traditions, then this tiny pamphlet might be a modest start. Other than that it seems mainly to be a way for Stephen Mitchell to increase his income with no effort whatever."
5,Excelent Hard Drive !,"Months ago I bougth Fantom 300GB external hard drive and I can say: this hard drive works fine and is fast to show my saved datas.I'm planning to buy another one - the same - because I feel confident to save my important video files on it. I recomend Fantom external hard drives!(Portuguese:Meses atraz comprei Fantom 300GB hard drive para uso externo e eu posso dizer: Este hard drive funciona bem e e rapido em mostrar os dados guardados nele. Eu estou planejando comprar desse mesmo produto, porque eu tenho confianca de guardar minhas filmagens nele. Eu recomendo Fantom external hard drive!"
4,Great game,I bought this game as soon as it came out in 98 I had a choice of either triple play 99 or this game so I choose this one at first I played it not that much but I recently started playing it again and I'm having a blast when yo hit a home run it doesnt look that realistic but It is fun and you will spend hours upon hours having fun
1,totally unrelated to the actual exam,"I cannot recommended this test preparation book, as it is comprised solely of multiple choice questions, without explanations of answers or study material, and is totally unrelated to the actual exam."
1,Ridiculous,"This book is chocked full of stupid old UK punk cliches, some of them seem to have more in common ground with glam rock than with punk (the Savage parents for instance.) Evil skinheads, the aesthetic mod, some token goth, and the rock star *cough* err punk rock parents. And they are all related by blood. Oh yeah don't forget the brother who sold out and got a job and gave up wearing a leather jacket and spiking his hair up, blah blah...Just another stupid, cliche glamorization of punk rock ""as it used to be"". Ultimately this just all dwindles down to bad writing combined with pop sensible art work. It all stinks of the decadence of the Reagan/Thatcher era society that the punk scene was trying to distance itself from.Ultimately boring and dumb... Maybe if some sense of reality of how things were back then with all the downsides and failings it would have been interesting, but I think that went over the head of the person who wrote this."
3,Broke after 18 months,"I have two of these changers, a black and and a silver one. The first broke after 18 months. After sending back to Yamaha certified repair Center, the option to repair was about $230. Guess what... A new one costs about the same........."
3,DVD Changer,The Changer is nice and the remote has a lot of features like repeat all disc and things like that however my DVD changer broke after a year and a month and of course it was out of warranty. If you buy any DVD changer please get a warranty. That's my opinion
2,Pretty close to junk.,"The large compass has no lock, so it is very difficult to use. The small compass has a lock, but is too small for almost any task. And it flew apart the moment we opened the package. All the metal parts are coarsely finished, difficult to adjust, and fit together poorly. Ignore the Staedtler name on this; it isn't the old Staedtler quality by any means, just a sad imitation."
1,Do not buy!!!!!,I bought this to cover for my jack while in the back of my suv. I thought keeping dog hair out of it would be a good thing. I tried several times to put my jack in the sleeve and each attempt I ended up cutting inch long slits in it. I eventually got the cover on and it looks good if you ignore the slits in it. I noticed in Petersons 4 wheel and offroad that there is a molded plastic piece that you can buy to cover only the mechanical parts of jack. I plan to get these. I would not recommend the jack protector it does not live up to the name hi-lift.
4,Hasn't seen the test of time yet...,My Hi-lift is mounted to my bumper/tire carrier and after 2 weeks of being exposed to the elements it started to show signs of rust. This protector is flexible and thin enough to slip over the jack yet fit within the Rugged Ridge Hi-lift tailgate mount.It seems to be doing the job of keeping moisture off the jack and its moving parts so far but only time will tell if any more rusty spots come up.My only complaint is that the cover BARELY fits over a Hi-Lift handle keeper. I had to slide the handle keeper down towards the base in order for the top of the protector to pass over the keeper and slip over the entire jack.
1,Doesn't fit the 60'',"The cover is made of poor quality, slits easily and worst of all-it doesn't fit the 60 inch hilift, as it was advertised to fit. I would not recommend this item. Get something solid, or a mounting bracket, which I will do."
3,Just ok,This product was not as tough as I thought it would have been. When sliding it over the jack for the first time it tore the material
1,Very dissapointing,I purchased this cover appx 2 months ago and when it was delivered i thought it to be cheap...and Almost returned it right away. But i decided to give it a fair chance. I should have returned the cover. Not only is the cover just a bit small it tears very easily. I would not recommend this cover to anybody.
1,meh....,"This did not fit my 60"" highlift extreme very well. Quality was not that great. I ended up throwing it away."
1,Don't lose your money,I heard a lot about this french guy so i bought this cd and was very disappointed.You'd better spend your money on the real ones !
3,Good starting point. Could have more precise info.,Good book. Absolute necessity. A bit wordy. Being a tech type I would like less words and more bullet points. Some of the URLs are not specific enough and require some digging.There is a 13th Edition available!!!!!!!
3,Fine but no NBA Live 2000,"This game was great back in '98 but there are many much better games now, such as NBA Live 2000. Don't try to safe few bucks if you know your not going to be happy with anything less than the best."
2,I wish I bought another printer,"As someone else mentioned, the printed pages curl. They curl so much that pages still coming out will push a heap of pages on the floor or even slide underneath what you've printed, knocking off the order. I've never used a printer that curled pages before. It also crumbles envelopes. And the manual feed is weak at picking things up.Who knows, maybe I'm just using crummy paper, but I doubt that's the case."
1,poor quality,"this is not a pro dudukit dos not have sizelike duduk A, duduk D, duduk Cwaste of money!"
1,They got stuck the first time I used them.,The first time I used the handcuffs they got stuck on my prisoner and I had to get them cut off at the jail.
4,Usability,"These cuffs are great. No problems at all. Look great, feel uncomfortable (as they are supposed to) and work great. Very sturdy."
2,Ok Try Something Else,I Would never get this product again because the metal is cheep and the cuffs don't even work... Spend the extra buck and get a pair of Smith And Wesson.
1,Horrible,When the product arrived the box was damaged I opened it it was broken piece of junk then buy this HORRIBLE COMPANY
3,A little stiff but worth the price,You cannot compare these to a peerless or smith and wesson...the machining is very rough...and while I didnt get a rusted out version like some of the other reviewers I did adequately test the lock and key mechanism before trying them on a wristsince these aren't going to be used professionally I didnt feel the need to spend a fortune... they are for playtime and I imagine if my partner did get stuck in the it would only add to the excitement...
2,Not good handcuffs,I bought these for my husband and when he was looking at them he realized that they didn't lock. that you can easily undo them without a key even if they were on tight.
5,It changed my life,"I was told about this book when I was in college, where I learned many things about what this book talks about.It literaly changed my life, my outlook in life and my disposition. 10 years later I still go back to it everytime I find myself with a problem or a concern. I use it almost like a Bible. It teaches you many things about life. It is Christian Metaphysics but it is written in a way that anybody could apply it to their lives christian or not."
5,Diamante de fuego en la corona del Altísimo,"Con poquísimo riesgo a equivocarme, me atrevo a afirmar que pocos libros habrán afectado (para bien) tanto la vida de buscadores hispanoparlantes de la Luz como el ""4en1"" de Conny Méndez.Toda crítica que puedan hacerle tanto a la obra como a su autora, quedan reducidas a nada ante el portentoso IMPULSO HACIA ADELANTE que muchos buscadores de habla hispana han experimentado al leer este libro.Qué mejor paso que este para dar inicio a la propia búsqueda espiritual, y adentrarse en la fabulosa Enseñanza que, para beneficio de la humanidad, han descargado los Maestros de Sabiduría.Bendita seas, Conny Méndez, doquiera que estés, por esto que hiciste por nosotros!"
5,Thes best,"Well this book is probably the best book, I have ever read in my life. Because it helped me change the way, I see life and it is very important; what the message in the book, it is also important to practice, the exercises that are in the book. I do not mean ""exercise"" to go to the gym, but exercises to help you control your mind and body. I love this book it changed my life and I have giving this book as a gift to many of my friends and close family and it has change the way they see life. So read it and try what it says, on the book and you will see!!!"
3,better to watch than to dance to...,"no doubt about blake being highly trained over the years, and a real pro; it's just that the rest of us, who are not exactly professional dancers, will find ourselves in some kind of trouble following this video... it contains a classical ballet section, with some leg over-stretching that i would not recommend trying unless you are some kind of blake. a jazz section, also included, presentes the same picture; it's too fast. if you're an intermediate or a beginner, this is not for you. if you are an experienced dancer, fit and trained, then it is for you..."
2,Not what I was looking for.,"I'm a dancer and I love finding new choreography, but this isn't really a dance dvd, it is more of a dvd praising Blake McGrath. He is a very talented dancer and the moves are okay, but unless you are a big fan of his don't waste your money."
5,Excellent Political Humour,This book portrays the political drama with an excellent sense of humour.
4,Great item !,This item is great and if you keep a look out you can really save and buy this in bulk. The company needs to improve the way the bottle is made because many times I have ordered this and the item has leaked out. It need a foil seal to keep this from happening. Amazon has always made it right so I would only recommend it from this seller.
2,Not sure,Well I cannot really say whether this is good for my guinea pig. The problem is that when I add this vitamins to water my guinea pig no longer drinks it
5,GREAT PRODUCT!,I ordered this for our 5 year old that has very sensitive skin. We use all natural products for the most part and that is a huge reason we purchased this product. It is 75% Cocoa Butter 25% Jojoba Oil. No fillers and chemicals added. We just started using but it is working great! It is solid so you need to warm between your palms to melt but it makes lotion after shower and bath more exciting for him! He likes melting and squishing it! Thank you NOW for making such a great natural product!!!!!!!!
5,I like this product.,"I have been using this brand of shea butter as a moisturizer for years. I am a licensed esthetician. It is a semi hard product, but I it grab some from the container with the back of my thumb nail and liquefy it by rubbing between my hands. It's great. I buy this for my friends whose kids suffer from eczema, and they have great results. This is a great product."
2,A little hard,"This product is absolutely hard and smells like cocoa. To use it, I have to run the closed container under hot water until the product melts."
1,not what the title claims,"The title claims that this is the cocoa butter mixed with jojoba. It's not. It's 100% cocoa butter with no jojoba oil added. I can get that elsewhere, for less money. Please Amazon, get your items straight."
4,Great if you can learn to use it.,"This product did not come in a black or dark bottle so I was thrown off. I went ahead and read the directions and gave it a shot. After using scissors to scrape the powder out, I rubbed it between my hands for about 5 minutes, then I got too tired and made my husband help me. We recently discovered that you can put some of the powder into a cup and microwave it to make it a liquid that is easy to apply. I hope this helps with pregnancy stretchmarks! It has done the trick so far :)"
4,Smells great,I just received my cocoa butter..... How ever it was not pure cocoa butter but with jojoba oil as welll. That's why it did not get 5 stars but I love it
2,cocoa butter,I did not understand the product to be in a solid state requiring heat to soften before applying. I do not use it often as it is time consuming to prepare.
2,Rock-hard cocoa butter,"Be aware that this product is rock hard when it arrives -- you have to use a spoon or knife to scrape some of it out of the jar and then spend time to warm it in your hands or warm it in the microwave (but not to melting) and it hardens back up once it cools off.It is not an inexpensive product, so I felt people should know that it takes some work to get these cocoa butter into a form soft enough to spread on skin.I won't buy this again -- it's just too much work for a skin product."
3,Cocoa Butter,"I usually buy shea butter for my skin, but I bought the cocoa butter this time, it is harder and smells very strong. it doesn't last as long on my skin as shea butter, I wasn't very impressed."
3,Decent moisturizer,"This cocoa butter was an ok moisturizer but not something I'd purchase again. I've tried using it in different forms: scraped straight out of the jar and then just rubbed on the skin until it's soft and absorbed, scooped into a bowl then placed the bowl in warm water to soften it, added a little coconut oil to soften it...this butter just didn't seem to sink into my skin well enough or give a long lasting moisturized feeling. NOW's shea butter did a much better job for me, but I personally might just need a more intense moisturizer.On the plus side, this stuff smells great and it helped to soothe my sister's bug bites. I'm sure it can be a sufficient moisturizer, but maybe it's only for those who have average skin instead of skin that's very dry."
5,Sex Trafficking,"Book is a very good personal level example of the large issue of sex trafficking. It doesn't go as in depth on the actual trafficking though, but it gets into the minds of the criminal and victims and answers a lot of questions people may have. Interviews with both the victims and criminals along with an extensive Q & A section are well done."
2,Great series-incomplete,This series is fantastic but the author has never finished it. It has been around three years since we read book eight. My son has been waiting to see what happens at the end but nothing. It may actually be four years now. Very cool series but if you want to start a series that has an ending this might not be it.
5,fantastic,"My 9 year old HATES to read, but with this series he read and read and read. He passed up playing on his ds to read. My 7 and 5 year old also loved listening to him read it. I also enjoyed it."
1,THESE ARE ALL FAKE REVIEWS!!!!,"Click on the ""see all my reviews"" link for reviewers on this book. All they have reviewed is the ""Instant..."" books like this one. Obviously planted reviews. I know which book on referral generation I'm NOT buying. Pathetic!"
1,Instant Referrals,"I a glad I borrowed this book from the library rather than having shelled out $ for it. Urfortunately I question my library now, ""Why did they have this rather than the first two referral books I had on my list!""The book is less about referrals than Mr. Sugars dream about general marketing and operation of a small business. I was frustrated in even finding direction from him to approach customers in requesting referrals. He seemed to dance around the referral process by writing about a variety of other business operating issues rather than getting to the point.Even more curiously, his ideas about customer contact appear outright bizarre. Who would want to do business with someone so haughty?My impression is that the author writes from dreams rather than experience.On the other hand, somehow the book had a lot of positive reviews and it caused me to waste my time in picking it up at the library. I humbly say I don't know how he did that!"
1,Don't waste your money,"Brad Sugars hypes himself as a business guru. His books are mostly simplistic generalities with some sound principles ""lifted"" from other writers. If you have read any other well-known authors you will find that Brad simply has regurgitated their material. Don't waste your money on his books or the consulting services he is really trying to promote. BTW, the majority of his book reviews are planted! Seems unethical to me."

4,A Fascinating Book From First Page to the Last,Young Tom Lapacka began as a casual Christian member of a church and member of a home where there was little peace and harmony. His grandfather influenced him to turn to Herbert W. Armstrong's World Wide Church of God. The radio programs attracted him as a high school student. The account of the author's acceptance of the teachings along with his eager search for the best makes absorbing reading. He rose to positions of trust and leadership in the group but somehow there was always a sense of dissatisfaction and longing for something more.This is a thrilling document about one individual's search for and finding the God of the gospels. The book challenges all Christians to be able to defend the faith to those who are seeking.
3,Good and Tries to Be Balanced...,"This book appears to be mainly accurate but one can sense a root of bitterness that he has not quite dealt with. If you are still in a cult, this book might give some useful information to help you think about why you are still there. Personally, I have found Mike Feazell's account - Liberation of the Worldwide Church of God -- to be filled more with love and understanding."
4,Better than you think,"I found this version to be a vast improvement on the previous versions. Last year's Championship Edition was very good, and I had no problem with taking corners at very high speed. This year's '98 version does have a considerable amount of understeer, but with reduced wings and grooved tires, so do the real cars. Formula 1 '98 very accurately reflects the problems of racing under F1's new rules, and I think it's the best Grand Prix sim I've played to date."
2,also disappointed...,"I agree with the other reviewer, this one is a big step backwards from the '97 version. There is horrible understeer that isn't on the previous version, and it can't even be fixed if you're using a standard controller. It's just barely tolerable if you use a steering wheel and make extreme adjustments. Like the other reviewer, I've gone back to the '97 version.The graphics are a bit better on the '98, but it's impossible to drive this version using a standard controller without the nose of the car going off into the gravel on every corner. What were these guys thinking?"
3,IF ONLY,"I LOVE THE GAME,THE CARS ARE FAST , THE SOUNDS ARE BACK TO A SHRIEK LIKE THE 95 GAME . IF ONLY THE CAR WOULD TURN. I FIND THAT IF I BRAKE WHILE I TURN THE CAR WILL TURN BUT THATS WITH THE GAS OFF, AND YOU HAVE TO USE THE BRAKE TO TURN GOING DOWN THE STRAIGHTS WHEN YOU NEED TO TURN SHARPLY, ITS A HASSLE. DARN IT'S TO BAD.ILOVE THE 97 GAME BUT MISS THE REPLAY,THE 95 GAME IS GREAT ALSO. GOOD LUCK FOLKS."
1,Disappointed with Shipping to Canada,"I ordered this product as a Christams gift for my father, who travels to Seattle frequently to see the Seahawks. I realized that it would be cheaper for me to buy the jersey online (even with shipping and duty) than buy it from a store here. Until it arrived.Fan's Edge offered only one option for Canadian customers: UPS. I ordered the jersey, but when it arrived, I was charged a $29.55 CAD ""brokerage fee"" by UPS, that was not listed anywhere when I made the purchase.As I will no longer purchase shipping from UPS, I will no longer buy from Fan's Edge. The brokerage fee is extreme, as it nearly doubled the cost of my purchase. I would advise Canadians to be aware of this disparity in the purchase agreement."
3,Interesting reading,"I probably won't try too many of the recipies in this edition, but it sure is fun to read!"
3,20 minutes for string beans - LOL,"I very much enjoyed this book and am encouraged to look into later editions. It's very interesting to see older versions of recipes. I like the smaller size of this hardcover which makes it easy to pick up and carry around for those moments when you want a light read while waiting on line in the post office or something. There is a scary part because there is a joke about a ""colored man."""
2,An interesting hitorical relic but fairly useless cookbook for today,"I grew up in the '50s and my Mother had several cookbooks but ""Joy of Cooking"" was the bible. All my childhood favorites come from the book and when I moved out on my own it was the basic cookbook on which I relied. I bought a more recent version about 15 to 20 years ago but it wasn't as good. This is NOT the version with which I grew up. It's recipes are few, very dated, and, mostly, uninteresting. If you like oysters there's several.An interesting read for it's historical and sociological value but not worth purchasing for the recipes themselves. Frankly, there are no recipes that I would try because either they are boring or they have been updated by more interesting versions."
4,No MJ or Shaq?!,"This game is overall a very good game (for it's time). However,it does have some major defects. I do not understand why the creators left out the greatest player ever to play the game: Michael Jordan! Instead of him the programmers put in some imitation player called ""roster guard"". They did the same thing with Shaq, except they called him ""roster center""! NBA Jam, NBA Jam T.E., and NBA Hangtime also left out ""His Airness"". I hope that these video game people dont do the same thing with Kobe, I may have to lead a basketball boycott."
4,NBA shootout is quite fun,"I recently received this game for free, and I think its terrific. Although, some cons of this game are that sometimes you get confused and don't know where you are, and when your shooting the ball in the basket its all about luck and not about skills like when you really play bball.. all in all, this game is terrific even if it is a game of sports."
3,Not to be considered as serious filmaking,"I saw this mess when it first came out in 1978 under the title ""The $6,000."" Yeah, it's junk, but it has a kind of ""so bad it's kinda good"" quality. ""Wild Man Steve"" Gallon who was a low-grade ghetto juke joint comic who never hit the big time (for good reason) appears as a drunk bum who is given super powers by soem mad scientist crooks who plans to use his powers to commit robberies. That's the plot folx. But hey, any film where somebody with as little going for him as WMS gets the FINE girl in the end can't be all bad! Oh yeah, the guy who was accurately described as ""looking like Chuck Berry after a night of drinking"" was ""The Boss"" Lee Cross, who was a Dj at WPAL-AM in Charleston, SC in the early 70s."
3,I wish the bristles were a bit longer!,"This tool pack is a necessity for the vacuum and works pretty well. I just wish the brush bristles were a bit longer to completely cover the heat sink on the baffle of my Quadra-fire pellet stove. If the bristles were longer the ash would be suctioned off the baffle much more quickly. To completely clean it, I must use the plastic hose attachment which is much more time-consuming."
1,89 CHEVY PROBLEM,BOUGHT IT AFTER MY GUAGE WENT SOUTH. GROUNDED GUAGE AND IT PEGS OUT SO I FIGURED THE SENSOR WAS BAD. STILL NOTHING..ALL I CAN FIGURE IS THE SENSOR WAS BAD OR THEY SENT ME THE WRONG ONE.....
3,"Worth the Read, but it will not inspire you.","I imagine that a great many soldiers were like the authors ""Raggedy Ass Marines."" Although I could relate to them somewhat, I'm thankful most soldiers were ready to be more diligent in their duty. I found the anti Southern attitude of his fellow New England yankee snobs (his much beloved Raggedy Ass Marines) very insulting, but I expected it. The author is apparently unaware that 62% of all Marine volunteers come from the South. I also agree with a previous reviewer that the scene with the ""Battle field whore"" is nothing other than creepy. I've never read of or heard of this before, yet the author acts as if it is a routine occurrence in battle field situations."
2,"Okay, verging on Weird","I didn't really like this book. The guy is just too personally strange! This seems to be too much about him and his own psychological issues, which I didn't find interesting or compelling at all. There is some good writing where he recreates the combat experience, but not too much. Some of the descriptions I thought were needlessly gross and graphic and I felt kind of disgusting. I think he has a problem in sexualizing the gore and the bodies, which left me very uncomfortable as a reader. It's ok, but I'm not sure I'd recommend this book. It lies on my shelf unfinished."
4,Great read on Pacific War,"Goodbye Darkness is a memoir which reads very well as the Marine who wrote it just so happened to have been a writer before the war. The author returns to the Pacific and makes stops along the war timeline. He speaks about each place as it was pre-war, as it is today (when the book was written) and as it was during the war. This was very helpful in refreshing my memory. Overall, I think this is a good companion book to 'With the Old Breed' & 'Helmet for My Pillow'. I would read one or both of the other books alongside this book for a true Marine Corps experience in the Pacific."
4,Makes you understand what a WWII veteran understands.,This personal account of WWII duty in the Pacific is moving and gives those who were not alive then a real feeling for what the environment was like. Very readable; shows the sacrifices made that few seem to remember today
3,Not up to my expectations,"I read a review of this book prior to purchasing it from Amazon and the reviewer stated it was one of the top 2 books covering WW2. After reading it, I do not think it is in the same league with Eugene Sledge's books on WW2. I felt too much emphasis was placed on the author's trip back to his previous battle grounds rather than on the details of the men involved and actual combat. Amazon as always provided the book at an excellent price and in a very timely manner."
5,The Hobo Philosopher,"I liked this a lot. I bought a few copies and passed them around. I felt that it was very thoughtful. It is not pro-war or even pro-soldering. But even though Manchester was a marine in the Pacific during World War II and is heavily pro-buddy an the Corps, he approaches war without all the who-harr. I especially liked his meeting himself analogy - the young soldier talking with the old soldier. I think Manchester was honest and reflective in this work. It was a good book and I'm sure that a good many old hardened marines have no problem associating and sympathizing with Mr. Manchester's reflections. It is a thoughtful book on the reality of war. I don't think that it is right or left - I think it is just the plain old honest truth as William Manchester saw it.Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:""Hobo-ing America: A Workingman's Tour of the U.S.A.."""
2,A Very Readable Lie,"William Manchester was NOT a rifleman. He gives the reader the impression that he was at all the invasions mentioned when in fact he was on Okinawa and served as an ""intelligence"" type. He claims ""trumatic lesions of the brain"", but gives little info on how that happened. He was a REMF (""rear echelon ...""). The book borrows liberally from other WWII accounts. It is not HIS story but a compendium of what other Marines went through.If you want to read a much better, closer to the fray report on WWII Marines, read E B Sledge's, With The Old Breed At Pelilu and Okinawa.I have a letter from Dr. Sledge where he lambasts Manchester's revisions history of his own military service as ""bunk."" Sledge's book is used at the Naval War College while Manchester's is not - says something.Yes, it does read well. But it's not what it is supposed to be. It's not a memoir - it's mostly a fraud."
2,An odd mix,"This book's strengths have been well stated. It is a good read, and it conveys a feeling for combat in the Pacific that comes directly from Manchester's experience.Or does it? As only one reviewer has already noted, Manchester finally explains as an afterthought, where few will notice it, that most of what he writes about so vividly never really happened to him. He confesses that the narrative ""we"" that he's employed throughout usually means (I'm paraphrasing) ""other Marines not including me"" !This deception (or, if you prefer, ""poetic licence"") makes ""Goodbye Darkness"" a most peculiar combination of memoir, history, and, perhaps, an unknown amount of realistic fiction. What gives here? And the subtitle is ""A Memoir."" That's quite a stretch.I feel cheated."
4,Must read book,"I picked this book up at a book exchange shelf at my local train station without thinking much about the title, but what a read! This is a breathtaking narrative on the island hopping campaign of the Pacific war and is a reminder of the long forgotten obscure islands of the wide Pacific where tens of thousands of American troops lost their lives. Japanese too, but this was a story told from the side of a Marine who fought in some of the battles. I defer to the other reviews below on the author's successful retelling of this theater of the people/battles/generals/admirals of WWII. Only thing I want to point out though is that he mentions Comfort women were volunteers who went to the obscure islands to do their part in the Japanese effort. This definately was not so. Please correct/retract this error Mr William Manchester, and Mr. Publisher."
5,WW II in the Pacific Theatre--A Malestrom,"This is the best book on the carnage that occured in the World War II Pacific theatre. It is also an excellent war biography of the author, William Manchester."
5,Great book,"A must read for people that want to understand the drama and trauma of war, and hear a first hand account from a great author about a major part of our history."
5,A marine's memoir,"William Manchester was a wonderful writer--one of the best I've ever read. In this case, he makes his personal history so interesting, you can't put the book down. I've read Goodbye Darkness twice over the years and am ready to do it again."
4,A good memoir - but Eugene Sledge is better,"William Manchester's memoir of World War II is quite good - although in my opinion there are better personal narratives of the war in the Pacific. What makes this out of the ordinary is that Manchester travels across the Pacific revisting the battle sites, re-telling their stories - and his own.His description of Guadalcanal is the best part, which is unfortunate, as it happens in the first half of the book. Manchester's strength is as a biographer - which does Goodbye, Darkness somewhat of a disservice. He does an outstanding job of painting vivid characterizations of Vandegrift, Nimitz and MacArthur, but at the expense of weakening what could have been a more memorable memoir. Manchester does a decent job of providing an overall view of the conduct of the war; but as far as personal accounts go, Eugene Sledge's With the Old Breed is by far a better read."
2,Phony as a $3 bill,"Fascinating book, if only because it's so deceitful and pompous. Manchester pretends until the afterword that he was a fighting Marine on Guadalcanal, Tinian, Saipan, Iwo Jima and Okinawa. Then, casually, tucked away in a paragraph, he admits that the ""we"" he used was the generic we, and that he only saw action on Okinawa. With that sly revelation he taints every word he wrote, including the blood-and-guts Okinawa recollection. A caricature that should never have been published."
1,"Part Travel Brochure, Part National Geographic","This was a very disappointing ""memoir"". I had just finished With the Old Breed by E.B. Sledge and was so moved that I started searching for other Pacific memoirs. If you are looking for a combat memoir, this is not it. Combat only comprises about 5% of the book's content. If you are looking for a memoir, this is not it. If, however, you are looking for beautiful, current descriptions of the islands in the Pacific, this is it. If you are looking for chapter after chapter reading about the lifestyle of the local natives, this is it. Extremely boring, extremely misleading, extremely non-combat, extremely not worth the money."
1,Excellent work of fiction,"I read ""Goodbye Darkness"" about 10 years ago and just recently reread it. I found it spellbinding both times, stayed up way late reading and reading ""just one more chapter""It captures the feel of combat and gives a very good history of much of the war in the Pacific.But this time I actually read the appendix. In it, Manchester notes that during the war he was only on Guadalcanal, after the fighting had ended and on Okinawa (Or was it Iwo Jima?)In short, all those detailed, first person stories including conversations etc, where I thought he was actually talking about himself never happened. At least not to him.I came away from the book with a VERY bad taste in my mouth. Perhaps if he had put this up front, I would have felt differently. As it is, I felt that I had been lied to and deceived.For that reason, one star. I'd give half a star if possible.I've read a number of Manchester's books and have always enjoyed them. Including ""Goodbye Darkness"""
2,Ugh...,"I remember being ""scammed"" into buying this years ago, by all the positive reviews on Amazon. I have 100+ military history books and memoirs on my shelf and this one was one of the worst! The author's writing style is really hard to digest and is more akin to a long, convoluted diatribe. I forced myself to the very end of the book, but the part where the author starts describing in vivid detail how he masturbated in a muddy shellhole to his vision of a ""Whore of Death,"" I was just done..."
5,No Sugar-Coating,"Highly realistic view from front line combat marine. Great exploration of WW2 Pacific battle fields. He went back to clear the ghosts. Well written - captivating.""Manchester was on Guadalcanal and later, in 1945, on Okinawa when most of his unit fell . . ."""
5,Goodbye Darkness is a must read for all Pacific War buffs,"This is more than a memoir of one man. You get the feeling that Manchester is telling the story of all those who fought. It's a detailed account of what it took to find a ""no quarters asked, no quarters given"" war, and its affect on the cultures of those natives who inhabited the battlefields. Civil War and European War Buffs have the luxury of easy access to those battlefieds, but those of us who are interested in the Pacific battlegrounds don't have that. Thanks to William Manchester for bringing that to us with his great literary style."
3,"Tremendous action; vivid and candid, albeit disjointed","Truly memorable descriptions of hand-to-hand combat on practically every Pacific island where a major battle took place. Book drags slightly when the author brings the reader to modern times on these islands, describing them in detail (as they appeared in the late 70's)."
5,Incomparable,"I do not know why it took me so long to hear of this book and now that I have read it I do not understand any of the criticisms made by other reviewers. This book is absolutely riveting. If you read no other book about WWII you should read this one. It is really about the American soul: that combination of courage, love, intelligence and devotion that that allowed American Marines to do what they did in the War and then build the America in which I grew up. These men were giants and it is deeply saddening to think that what they did is so little known and understood by Americans today."
5,There is a reason that it is the icon,"This book is recognized as the masterpiece account of the Marines efforts in the Pacific... and for a good reason. It is a painfully personal account of the horrors, some of humors and a lot of the happenstance of war... all from a brilliant, but quite human and humble man/child. A must read."
2,Tears over the horrible taste,"My kids would not eat them. It was a battle over them taking them with tears and all, but then I realized they do taste horrible. What a waste of money... in the trash they go. On a side note, I bought the smarty pants gummies afterwards and they like the taste of those. Should have started there."
2,poor taste,"i was so excited to get this for my boys as it's all natural ingredients and full of the vitamins and minerals my kids need. my 8 yr old wanted to try it once it came and i was anxious over him liking it as they are more used to gummy vitamins. he ate 1/2 of it and looked disgusted, so i ate the other half. the taste is still lingering in my mouth and it's far from fruit punch. i'm hoping someone will take these as they are full of great ingredients and love the fact there are probiotics included, too!"
2,"Great vitamins, bad taste","I ordered these vitamins for my 3 and 5 year olds. They loved the star shape but couldn't get past the bad taste, unfortunately. I thought they were just being difficult so I tried one and it really wasn't palatable. Otherwise, the shipping and packaging are all excellent."
2,Stars crumble,"While I appreciate the ""holistic"" nature of these vitamins, the stars crumble and we are left with many star pieces! Very few whole pieces and we are 2/3 done with the bottle."
1,No one could stomach these,"I wasn't terribly surprised when my picky guy spit his out in the sink, but when my good eater proclaimed them disgusting I decided to try one myself. I don't know whether we got a bad batch or if they are supposed to taste like sour dirt, but they were truly inedible and we'll be moving on to try something else."
1,My kids hates these!,"My kid hates these! I tried quite a few times to get her to eat them... She's 18 months and not a picky eater at all. She loves variety in her food and lots of different flavors. We chose these because we didn't want to confuse ""gummy vitamins"" w/ candy i.e. ""gummy bears"". Well, after finally giving up on her ever taking these... I decided I would use them. OMG!, they are horrible. They have a gritty chalky bizarre fruity flavor and I now understand why she wouldn't even entertain consuming these. Please save your money, these vitamins are just plain gross. I'm still searching for the perfect kid vitamin."
4,Love these vitamins!,"I've been searching for this type of vitamin for a long time. Combination of vitamins, minerals, and a probiotic is just what I've been searching for, plus all natural and dairy free. My son doesn't care for the flavor but he does take them anyway. The taste is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5."
2,karn818,"I was very happy to be replacing our brand of childrens' vitamins with ones not loaded with sugar, coloring & high fructose corn syrup.. Unfortunately, my boys do not like the taste, therefore, will not eat them. My oldest will choke it down because he knows it is good for him, but my youngest will not touch them. I tried them & have to admit they don't taste very good."
1,Son won't take them...doesn't like the taste,"Son won't take them...doesn't like the taste. He tried to make me happy by chewing one, but he could only get half of it down. Will give them to a neighbor."
2,Eh,"My kids were the critics and for the first time in their lives, DID NOT want to take their vitamins. I tried one to see what the fuss was about and it's definitely got a chalky flavor to it. Unfrtly, we won't be continuing with this product."
2,Autie Mom,"These vitamins a very large in size. They are not very thick, but they are for a child defficient in oral motor skills. He did not like the taste. I had to break it into smaller pieces."
1,Nasty,Don't waste your money. These things are nasty and no kid in their right mind would think they taste good!!!
5,Both kids love them and I do too!,"I have read a few reviews that say these are disgusting, but I have not found that to be the case. I take one and I give them to my 3 year old and 18 month old as well (I only give the 18th month old 1/2). They both love their vitamins. They do not taste like candy, but that is because they are all natural and healthy for you so you have to give up a little of that unnaturally fruity candy taste in order to have a healthier product. I definitely recommend them!!"
3,Not sure...yet,"After reviewing the other comments I figured I would try this for my kids. The other reviews say their kids like the taste but I had a different experience. My 2-year old will not go near it. I have to ""threaten"" my 4-year old to take it (it's either the vitamin or a spoonful of honey) and my 11-year old hates it also but she still tolerates it. So although I am happy with the benefits of the vitamin, my kids are not happy with the taste but it's tolerable."
2,too many broken stars!,"Rainbow Light is one of my favorite brands of natural supplements; I take their women's once daily multi myself every day. I wanted to love these for my kids, but there were 2 shortcomings.1 - the taste was not their favorite. While they didn't moan, groan and cry before eating them, definitely not something they enjoyed. I tried one myself and have to say the fruit punch has some kind of an after taste that was almost a little metallic tasting? Truly not the yummiest kids' vite out there.2 - this was my main complaint. The vitamins are pretty large and rather fragile. Every bottle I ever bought always had a number of broken stars that were impossible to eat and made a mess of the jar. I know it's not a shipping issue, because I encountered the same issue with a bottle that I bought in a retail store. It was just too annoying to overlook and the reason I won't rebuy or recommend these."
3,"My children don't like them, either","I was very excited to find a food-based multi-vitamin for my children. I was also pleased that these contain probiotics. Unfortunately, my children despise them. I know part of the fault lies with me because I have fed them gummies in recent years (I appreciate the fish oil in the brand we were using, but the danger to their oral health was too great to continue using them). My children are accustomed to a candy-like vitamin. However, these really are disgusting. Three of my four will choke them down because I've told them we can't buy more vitamins until these are gone (they were a bit pricey!) but I really need to find something a bit more palatable."
2,"Good Vitamin, but taste horrible","These are good vitamins and I wish I could rate them higher BUT the taste of them is horrid. My kids didn't like them at all, we tried for a few days but due to a lot of crinkled faces and spitting them back out. We decided they just aren't for us."
1,Thumbs Down From all 4 Kids,"These vitamins are nasty. I was very excited to find an all natural multi-vitamin/mineral for my children....BUT I just threw away $10.00. I wish they sold samples of vitamins.My kids reactions:11 year old almost threw up - she has a strong gag reflex.10 year old ate his with a pained look on his face - but finally got it down, he said they are sandy.13 year old says these vitamins are disgusting.5 year old says Dear Vitamin People, these vitamins are terrible!After all this, I tried one myself - the kids are right - they taste horrible.I would not recommend these vitamins."
1,awful taste!,"I usually don't write reviews, but felt I had to include my feedback. I love the Rainbow Lite Prenatals and was excited to try these vitamins for my kids. I was impressed by the nutritional information. However, they taste AWFUL and my kids refuse to eat them. They are not picky eaters and have easily taken many other kinds of vitamins. After tasting a tiny bite myself, I don't blame them. These vitamins taste disgusting, and if kids won't eat them, what's the point?"
2,Disappointed...no good if they won't eat them,"Bummer...lots of great reviews, but my three vegetable, healthy food eating children disliked these. they won't finish the bottle. Outstanding nutrition and food based product, so I will rate it 2 stars, but overall, not for us. I don't think you will know for sure if your kids will like them until you just order a bottle and see. You cannot base it off of the reviews....kids are just all too different!"
5,Excellent multi-vitamin for children,My son loves the taste of this vitamin....ands it's one of the best multi-vitamins on the market for children!
5,Great!,"My 1.5 year old loves these. I was a little worried that they would be too hard for her but she has no problem chewing them even though she only has 8 teeth :) Very good vitamin, happy I tried it."
1,Awful taste,"I had been recommended that Rainbow Light Brand by a friend and was very excited to get them. The Fruit Punch flavor sounded like something my young kids would like, however neither of them could get them down. The flavor was awful and tasted nothing like Fruit Punch. I was so disappointed to spend money on these my kids gagged when eating them. I even tried to give them to two of my sisters to see if their kids would like them, and none of the 9 kids in our family would eat these!"
4,They're good vitamins.,"I dig that they have all the good stuff my son misses out on by being so picky. However, he won't eat them. At first, I was bummed, thinking that they were a total waste. Then I noticed that they broke down very easily. Now I crush them into powder with a spoon and add that to his PB&J. He eats it with no complaint, actually preferring a sandwich with the vitamin to one without. The powder also dissolves pretty well in applesauce, but it turns green."
5,These are great!,A whole foods vitamin and they taste yummy according to the kiddos :) They are easy to remember as they are only 1 per day too.
4,Natural and my kids love them!,"These were recommended by a friend after Melaleuca changed there kids vitamins. These vitamins taste great and my kids love taking them. (more than flintstones!) I couldn't believe all the reviews for kids who wouldn't eat them and so I new I needed to review them for others. I tried them and think they are good. They are not candy they are a vitamin and this is one of the best tasting and without all the food coloring, sugar and artificial everything."
5,My kids like them,I ordered these because of all the positive reviews and am happy with them. Both my three and one year old like them and eat them daily. They arrived quickly and none of the vitamins were broken inside due to shipping.
4,Very enjoyable recording of a Donizetti rarity,"This a very enjoyable recording of an opera by a still young Donizetti who was, at this point, developing the particular style for which he would later be admired. The music is thus closer to Rossini but the score is not a mere copy, a young Donizetti can be recognized. The star of this recording is the Peruvian tenor Juan Diego Flórez (this is I believe one of his first recordings after his debut in 1996) but the other artists in this live recording offer a good performance as well, so the overall effect is very pleasing.If you are a Flórez fan or a Donizetti admirer (specially from his first years) this is a recording you must own!"
