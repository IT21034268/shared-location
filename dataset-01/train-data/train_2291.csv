3,"If you're a ""wide-body"" like me, don't waste your time.","ObusForme by Homedics OFHB-BLK Highback Backrest SupportAs stated in a previous review, lower edges are curved too far forward and not wide enough for ""chubby"" individuals. The edges will stab you in the kidneys - even with the velcro-on lumbar pad in place. Get the upgraded ""Ultra"" model instead."
4,Obus High-back Backrest,I am very happy with this backrest. I use it in the car and it really helps my lower back.
2,The new Obus *Ultra* Forme is much better than this one,"I purchased this Obus Forme High-back Backrest and found it wanting. It helped some - but the basic design is flawed because of its concaved nature. I returned it and purchased the new Obus *Ultra* Forme Backrest and love it. It is more expensive, but the design is radically different than anything that I have seen and it works much better than this model. By the way, Amazon makes return rather easy if a product doesn't work out."
5,Best Coffee on the planet,"Ok, Starbucks is awesome too, but this coffee is an acquired taste and is without the doubt the most unique and great tasting coffee.Since it has chicory, you do not mix as much as you would normal coffee. (To be precise, you would mix about half as you normally would).However, even know it is robust, it still contains less caffeine then normal coffee. By the way, chicory is extremely healthy for you.Try it today, taste what New Orleans has had for well over 140 + years."
1,Decaffeinated Coffee,"I was send Decaffeinated Coffee which is fine if that is what you want, by the time I pay to return it ($15) and then pay to ship it again ($15) might as well keep RIGHT!!!! Beware of this vendor. Coffee shown in image is not Decaffeinated Coffee, and Decaffeinated is not mentioned in the ad any wareUpdate as of 12/14/2012I decided to try this Coffee I got from (Asian Store) because I am stuck with it. But have to report this Coffee is FAKE in my option. I had both this morning and near as I can tell there is no Chicory in this coffee. Also the can size is wrong ""Café Du Monde Coffee"" comes in a 15 oz. Can, not 13 oz., and the label font is wrong in spots (had a real can handy to compare it to). Buy this coffee from ""Café Du Monde"" directly, I will be tossing this crap"
5,Best Ball Bucket,Looks great. Solid. Padded seat.I got six of them for some reason. I thought I was paying for one. Maybe it was a mistake.
5,REAL LIFE DRAMA,"This book was very well thought out and it made you feel you knew the characters personally. As always Ms. Sims writes so vividly that you can image yourself in the story. She is blessed to be able to comfort, and entertain people with her GREAT WORK. (Ms. Sims Be Blessed)"
3,Review about this,"At first when i got it, it arrived in a pink box which i thought good because my girlfriend loves pink. I opened it up to find that the pink sapphire was really small and that the photo was just a close up on it. Just another example of be careful of what you buy. Overall, it was great but i still expected it to be a bit bigger its smaller than the tip of my pinky. I still say thank you soo much for it, it was a great gift."
2,weak design,"I purchased this scooter to ride with my 4 and 7 year olds. It was supposed to be able to handle over 300lb. I weigh 210 so I figured I was within the spec. Within the first two miles of standard riding the scooter began to bend. I estimate the structure can't handle more than 150 lbs without bending.A cheap, dissappointing product."
1,Junk,"When I first pulled this device out of the box, I could tell it was a solid machine. It rode like a dream, it had all the features I could want in a scooter; easy to open, easy to close, easy to ride.Exactly thirteen hours later, I went to unfold it again, and could not get the latch to fall in place once it was opened. I tried with my right hand, then with my left, then with both, then with my foot, then with my knees, then with a vice, then with a sledgehammer. Then the latch broke off the bike."
2,kinda boring but concept's right,"that's it. kinda boring but concept's right. two stars for the latter, and missing three+ stars for the former. lacks real touch of first class musicianship."
5,Really Cool,"Saw them open for David Byrne......a truly great band....good lyrics and a lot of musical experimentation......It's sad that really talented and passionate musicians like this you find by accident, while talentless passionless drivel like NSync, B Spears etc...we get bombarded with daily...."
5,Love the Brown color,These are just wonderful. The size and color are great. The red is a little pink. I like the matte finish of the edges. Both of the bowl sizes are great as well. Mugs are prefect size and shape.
1,Arrived broken,The Notitake Colorwave Blue Pasta Bowl arrived broken. It was merely wrapped in bubble wrap and then loosely placed within a larger cardboard box with other items. Any rough handling of the outer box will have slammed the heavy bowl down and broken it.
2,Not to impressed,I bought this camera based on some of the reviews listed on Amazon. I took some pictures and they really weren't that good. About half of them were clear and the other half kind of blurry. The colors were not bright either. I expected better from Canon. I'm not new to point and shoot camera's. I've had a Olympus and Nikon; and I never had this problem. Although the Olympus and Nikon were priced in the [price] range. I guess you get what you pay for.
4,"well done, but doesn't have the battery saving auto off",Its a wonderful camera with all the nice features. I really liked it. I have used it on a trip to Niagara Falls and the photos came out fantastic even in low light. My only negative about this is that it doesn't have the auto shutoff feature.
3,Good but...,"The camera is great. Cheap, light, sturdy and decent quality snapshots. The only drawback is, as another reviewer already mentioned, that it's sometimes tough to find the ""DX"" coded film that the camera requires. For me, an inexpensive little 35mm camera is supposed to be about convenience; when I have to go to three drug stores to find the film I need, it's decidely inconvenient."
3,"Great outdoor shots, indoor flash photos not great","This camera takes great outdoor photos. All those pictures have been beautiful. I am disappointed with my indoor flash photos. Some come out great, others are too bright, some too dark. The pictures of my white and black cat are glaringly bright. I had a Ricoh for 10 yrs, & every flash photo was perfect. I ordered the Canon mostly because I wanted a smaller, lighter camera. I am kind of sorry I sold my old one."
1,A lemon I guess,Bought this a year ago and nothing but trouble. It was overexposing and the photos with flash were overly white. Took it in to be fixed under warranty and it's better but still not that great. Looking for a new camera now...will look elsewhere.
4,"good, but no date","This is a good camera in its class, and well-rated by CR. But despite the claim made in the current ""editorial reviews"" description, this model has no date imprint feature. If you want that, try the ""sureshot 85 zoom/date""."
5,Easy for an 80 year old!,I bought this camera for my Mom and she loves it. She's 80 years old and love to take candid family shots. The Canon film loads easily and the auto advance is great too.
3,I did not receive my purchase,"please take in to consideration that I am a man who received a women sunglasses, in a purple color.ummm was a wrong shippngSince I do live overseas, what an I do now?"
3,Other books in the series may be better,"I don't think it is well-written, and it's analogies are ard to follow. ""Calvin for Armchair Theologians"" had me expecting more, but ..."
3,Pretty good.,"The Tuttles return back to Pebbles Beach for their annual summer holiday. Kelsie is depressed and sad about losing her last summer love- she wonders who the woman that shunned Peter, he ex was. When she finds out it was Ella, she completely excludes Ella from her life and makes the summer for Ella dreadful. Manipulative Ella has fallen in love with a geeky nerd- the only guy who so far hasn't fallen for her charms and Beth is madly in love with George, but will she forget all about him when a new guy pops up at the beach?This book was so much better than the previous book but there was still the flirty aroma that flaundered around in Summer Boys. Still a pretty good book."
5,This Book Rocked!,This was probably one of the best books i have ever read. Even better then the first one. I could not put it down and every teen girl should read this. Some stuff may not be approprite for ages younger than 13 but i found this book to be one of the ones that you can never put down.. Absoutly my favorite book/series of all time!
4,I couldn't put this book down!,"My friends got me hooked on the Summer Boys series, and I ended up reading both books in a day! I loved being able to see each character's story from their pont of view, as well as from the other characters'. At times I was absolutely furious at some of the girls, but the majority of the time I was just absorbed in the book, cheering Beth, Kelsi, and Ella on! Well, not really Ella, because she's too risque. But I was cheering for Beth and Kelsi. =]]]"
3,slowly getting better,"Its been a year, and its time for the Tuttle girls to head back to the beach. Kelsi still doesn't know what happened with Ella and Peter, but that changes soon upon their arrival. Furious, Kelsi shuns Ella and puts her own chance for a relationship at risk. Ella, meanwhile, is attracted to a shy, slightly geeky guy, who is the only person she's ever met who can resist her charms. Beth has a great relationship with Greg, but he's not here this summer.....will she be able to resist a tall, dark stranger at the beach?"
3,THREE and a half stars overal FIVE STAR ART,"I liked Matt Wagner's work both as writer and illustrator best in Batman VS Grendel (Hunter Rose) limited series. His artwork in Devil's Quest was outstanding and you can see more of the same by his colleague, JK Snyder.Story is so so, although tempo is good, but ART...I loved this book!!! It is not best trade/graphic novel but it is definitively good enough to buy it for Your collection."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"Wagner has come up with a new incarnation of the old Justice Society character. This man is a doctor, a surgeon, and as such is very useful to a superhero organisation. However, it is fairly standard stuff. An accident makes him blind, but he gains complete and total night vision, which leads to a bout of costumed adventuring after dark."
2,Another bland start for another bland hero...,"A very clichéd do-gooder steps on someone's toes and looses most of his eyesight from the scuffle. Now he's a do-gooder in tights who can barely see! Wonder where I've heard that one before? The writing is canned and the art, while occasionally decent, is mostly just amateurish.Don't waste your money."
3,A sharp recording,"The ensemble does have a nice edge to their sound, but I actually listened to a recording of the piece by the Amsterdam Wind Orchestra from 1990 that was recommended by a professor at the Crane School of Music. It was very musical and very moving. I believe it is also out of print, which is unfortunate because it is a wonderful recording."
3,"Great Music, Find a Better Recording","I've heard this recording. The Music is Great. De Meij is possibly the greatest if not one of the greatest composers of this time period. His use of the instruments potential is wonderful. This is truly a great work.However, I have heard a better recording. The United States Marine Corps Band. They have a recording out of the Symphony No. 1: Lord of the Rings and Stravinky's Firebird Suite. It is a live recording and simply amazing."
3,"Good music, but not Middle-Earthish","Just last night, I went to a concert that had Johan de Meij's first five on that track. Between the pieces, people dressed up as Gimli, Gandalf, Frodo, Smeagol, etc, would explain what was happening during the next piece.. LOL Smeagol kept on poking everyone in the band!I prefer Howard Shore's LotR music (from the movies), but this is also interesting. It doesn't have a Middle-Earthish feel to it, but the music is, for lack of better words, 'heroistic'. It's good music for anyone, but as I said, Tolkien fans shouldn't get their hopes up. I didn't purchase the CD, but I heard the music live last night (not that I can remember it well). Like I said, the music has lots of action; some parts can surprise you (If it's the first time you've listened to it), especially Gollum's piece."
3,It's okay.,"It's didn't really work for me, my group had already done so many of the crafts in this book, that it just wasn't helpful for me. If you need kids crafts the Internet it usually a better source with easier printables."
2,Let Down,"Considering the title, I was really excited to get to do the activities. However, when I got the book, I was a little dissapointed because out of 600 or so activities, I couldn't even get a week of lessons out of it. Partly was because some of the themes were for younger kids, and would only take up about ten minutes of circle time. Others, were thought out, but would require items that were not typical classroom materials. Another element that threw me off, was that I assumed the activities were tried by other teachers and recommended, but it seemed like they assimilated the ideas because they fit with the theme and not necessarily because they were approved by other teachers"
3,It's okay- just okay,"Ok so maybe all of you paid more attention to the fact that this is only 2.5"" in size. I knew it would be small, but it's VERY small.Also doesn't do a great job as a prism, doesn't do much in the way of rainbow colors or anything like that."
4,Wah-lah!,"This prism worked great! I have always just used a glass of water in a clear round glass using direct sunlight. This requires the room to be a little dark and you can use a flashlight. It took messing around with the angle to get it to work, but it produced a nice rainbow!"
1,doesn't really work,"I might have been expecting the cover of dark side of the moon when I put this prism to sunlight. This prism doesn't seem to work. You'll get a small rainbow at an odd angle, but it's hard to focus, or project for example on a wall. I bought this for my 2-year old daughter who loves rainbows. She won't be seeing any from this ""prism"". I'm looking for another that I hope will work better than this one."
1,Worthless reprint available free on web,"This is a reprint of a HBR article from 2000. While it outlines the concept, it is not worth a dollar. I wish I could get my money back."
4,The Peckhams are wonderful,"This book, ""On the instincts and habits of the solitary wasps,"" by George W. Peckham and Elizabeth G. Peckham, was originally published in 1898, in Madison, Wisconsin, as that state's ""Geological and Natural History Survey Bulletin, no. 2."" The Peckhams' observations are precise, and their prose simple. No nature-faking or unfounded anthropomorphism is to be found in their writing. A science classic that can be read with pleasure even today (2009). Luckily, this work is not in copyright and can be downloaded from The Biodiversity Heritage Library."
5,"Face it wanna-bes, the girl definatly CAN rock!","this is wat i love about hilary, she sing LIVE! I heard her in concert. she does NOT lip-synce, i know that for a fact. hil fans, this will be the best thing to your hilary duff collection"
5,This girl CAN SING!!,"First of all, the DVD is great. I want to direct my attention to some haters here who are saying Hilary can't sing, and who are using words like ""lip-sync"" and ""miming"". I just watched Dick Clark's New Years Rockin Eve last night, where Hilary not only hosted the Hollywood show, but sang 3 songs as well. Let me tell you there WAS NO LIP SYNCING. She sang in a clear beautiful voice. One of her songs, Wake Up, even sounded better than the CD recording! I think the haters need to move on down the line, because HILARY IS FOR REAL!So if you're reading this and trying to decide to buy one of Hilary's products, who should you believe, a few people on this website with no credentials, or some very powerful studio executives who hired Hilary to host a huge 2 hour show PLUS sing 3 songs LIVE?"
2,And The Point of This Is...,"Hilary sounds the same in concert as she does on cd. She lip syncs and her mic isn't loud. And the ""high"" notes she hits on her album she doesn't even sing.The concert is boring too. Britney usually lip syncs but at least shes entertaining and makes it fun, Hilary doesn't."
1,Milli Vanilli 3000,"This DVD is basically like a Milli Vanilli 3000. I dunno about Live. It is just Memorex. Parents, please do not buy this for your kids. It is a ripoff. A money-making machine."
3,"""Da ,Girl can Lip-sync Rock"".","First and foremost I'm also a fan of ""Hilary Duff"" but why release a Live concert if all the way she will Lip-sync 13 of her songs. That is really a drag and will also affect her credibility as a singer and take note news spread easily if she is really the real deal. Another thing the mic volume seems so small that the instruments seems to dominate her voice. What are the guys in charge of her up to? If there will be a next time please don't make the same mistake twice !!!"
4,Well Made... Not Bad for First Concert Recording,"This was a very well made recording. The video production of the concert and audio quality of the instrumental band was extremely high. Interesting editing choices: the recording is a combination of two concerts and two very different venues. The voice dubbing for Hilary was an interesting choice, and I personally wish they hadn't done the dub--Hilary's vocals rock live. The real gem of this DVD are in its behind the scenes features. Seeing her practice with her band is such a great feature, and seeing her and her sister tour the bus for the first time. The Making of ""Come Clean"" was another great feature, and I appreciate Buena Vista Home Entertainment including the full video for ""Come Clean."" I look forward to seeing Ms. Duff's next concert recording, with full live recording of vocals."
1,'The Girl Can Rock?' Hahahahahaha.,"Sorry, had to comment on the ridiculous title. 'The Girl Can Rock?' If 'The Girl' can rock then Cliff Richard can rap.Don't like her songs either. Tries to be a 'punk rock chick.' Very poor."
1,DUFF SUCKS!,"1-she can't sing.. she screechs2-she can't rock-P0SER!3-P0SER!she shouldn't be able to deserve the chance to make cds/dvds. there's many people WITH talent out there that don't even get a chance. she just has connections, not because she has talent. she has 0 talent!"
1,LOL!!!!!!!!!!,"I'm still laughing at this title? THE GIRL CAN ROCK?!?!?!?!?!? Is THAT the title? Hilary Duff can rock.......lol x1000000000000000000000000. I'm still chuckling a bit. Then again, I'm dissappointed that Disney and MTV allow this fake to destroy pop music.Like I said in my BSB review, no wonder why people don't like pop! MTV has brain-washed them into (...) like this, Sl*t Spears, Hell Hilary, J. H0, etc."
1,SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!,"God! I hate Hilary Duff! She always acts & sings so sweet(I have her first album)to trick you! She's not that much of a caring person! First of all, she only has 2 charities! 2! One is a fashion line, and the LAST ONE is just one for kids! Careless! The only person she loves and appreciates is her fricken sister!Like Lindsay Lohan instead! She's MUCH coller!P.S. HILARY SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!EVEN ASHLEE SIMPSON IS BETTER THAN HER!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,A touch of a 'lost' time..,"Music reflects the mood of the people it represents.. this CD tells the story.. nothing really new.. joy, sadness, heartbreak and hope.. The CD fits the bill and brings the listner to a place that may be far away, yet vivid in the minds eye. It is music of a land full of life.. and all its encounters! One may not understand every word.. but should be able to understand the feelings.. In my opinion.. a good representation of music of this island that has roots made form a number of transplants. Hope you enjoy and have, perhaps, a glass of Nero d'Avola, or your favorite beverage as you listen to music from a 'special' island!"
5,A Real Cute Book!,"A perfect choice for a bedtime story! I am looking forward to seeing more African-American children's books like these. Young children will love it if you imitate the animal sounds while reading. Sweet, adorable illustrations add the perfect touch! Cherlina Works - author of Jewel's Magical Christmas."
2,weak,"This is a pretty weak book, I bought it in search of more Black books for my baby, but there are better options out there, like ""Who's Toes Are These"""
2,IS THIS REALLY NON-FICTION ?,THEY ARE HOT STORIES.........BUT HOW DO WE KNOW THAT THEY ARE TRUE.IT COULD VERY WELL BE FICTION.
3,BR330T Scanner,"These are very good Hi -end scanners, Recently dis-continued, but stillavailable and very WORTHY. Massive features.They have a Huge range of frequencies, not found in any other scanner.Bottom line. AWEsome but Very Very Complex to program."
5,"""Blitz"" at his finest!",Metal but bluesy with the vocals matching perfect with the music. I wish they would keep this band/side project going as it the way side projects should be...not sounding like the original band. This is not Overkill with speed but Bobby showing off the more evil blues side. Highly recommended for any Overkill fan.
4,WOW!,"I just received ""Room Full Of Sinners"" in the mail. (I ordered it from Amazon.com)And...WOW! I LOVE Overkill, but Bobby's singing on THIS album is SOMETHING to be reckoned with.For ""fun"", Bobby should do another CD with this band. However, I cannot WAIT to hear the new Immortalis CD.Bobby, if you are ""listening"", PLEASE bring Overkill close to Indianapolis!? I have been a fan since 1988 (""In Union We Stand"" video on Headbanger's Ball got me started) and I have YET to see Overkill LIVE!I would LOVE to see you guys, and, I would pay royally to see you. Screw the new VH and their ""149.99, plus the convenient charge"" for their tickets. You guys are the real deal!"
5,A winner from start to finish!,"The Loser's Club is a face-paced, witty read from start to finish! Cal Brantley, the female private investigator, is a smart, savvy and street wise P.I. with enough compassion to know how to handle any situation that arises. The dialogue had me laughing, and I couldn't help admire how Cal dealt with her fellow investigators, including the on-the-edge, ex-L.A.P.D. detective Denny Wickerstaff.Cal's private life becomes intertwined with her investigation of the death of a young boy in a Reno casino, and the twists and turns in the plot kept me guessing. As I turned the last page I knew that I wanted more! I'm hoping I'll be reading more adventures of Cal Brantley - I like that woman!Hats off to this new writer. Lise S. Baker is on her way and I can't wait for her next book!"
3,"Great product, questionable reliability","I absolutely love the IG170 sauna and used it daily for two weeks when I first received it. However, the steamer failed and I had to pay a hefty postage fee to mail it to Canada for repair. I was disappointed that neither Amazon or Caduceus Aromatics chose to reimburse me for shipping. The unit was repaired relatively quickly and is working. But the policy of both companies toward shipping of NEW defective products should be re-evaluated."
2,Doesn't Look Right,This hat looks funny on almost anyone's head. The shape is stretched out and somewhat square. The material is thin and the hat is too short to cover one's ears. It does not fit tightly or well.
1,Not for Cats!,"I tried to put my 6 month old kitten in this carrier for a vet visit. Got her in, and she had enough strength to pop the snap on the top flap!! Not secure, and the leash clip is no good on squirming cat! Might be fine for a small dog, but not a kitten or cat."
5,Safe and Easy to Use,"Works well.My primary use is to trim large branches that are on the ground so I can feed smaller pieces into my chipper.The chain oiling 'system' is simple, trouble-free but a bit messy.Don't expect to cut branches that are 4"" -- I limit the size to about 3"".I'm happy with the unit. Works as well as I'd hoped. Feel safe when using it. Would be nearly impossible to force chain into the ground/dirt while using the saw."
4,happy with the scissor saw,"this tool is great. Seems to cut larger than 4"" diameter branches and the setup is real easy. Having it tethered to an extension cord is a bit of a hassle but the safety and usability of the tool make up for the minor annoyance."
3,Cool Tool,"The Alligator (my wife's idea)is so easy to use that my wife now volunteers to help cut the firewood. For big jobs, we still need a chainsaw, but the Alligator means the smaller stuff (3""-4"") can be more quietly and much more safely cut. Our backs and arms don't ache after an hour of cutting. And there is no gasoline smell in the air!"
1,Chain Saw for the Wife,Not very good except for very light pruning by the wife. It is safer than a real chain saw esp. when cutting above the shoulder. does jam a lot one step up from a hand saw. Stress
2,Black and Decker Alligator Lopper,"This is really a good item, my husband has used it many times..good purchase"
1,LP 1000 Alligator Lopper 4.5 Amp Electric Chain Saw,I was disappointed with the capabilities of the saw. My regular electric chain saw is more versatile.
2,Requires two-handed operation.,"I am a homeowner who uses a wide variety of cutting tools for pruning & cutting trees. At first glance at the picture, I thought I had found a one-handed operation, chain saw. I use gas-operated large & small chainsaws, as well as a lightweight electric, 14"" chainsaw. I use them on the ground and up in the trees. While the picture may have been obvious to someone with good eyesight, that it is a two-handed tool, the text is not so clear. It looks good for what it is intended to cut but doesn't suit my needs. So, my search continues."
4,It works as advertised,This produst works as advertised. I did all the pruning as well as clean up in short order. The unit was much easier to use than my small chain saw. Was able to control the logs in a safer manner. It was worth the purchase.
5,great item,This is a great product i was not going to buy at first but so glad i did it cuts everything to its specifications...
4,Not bad for what it's intended for,"This is not a full fledged chain saw but rather a glorified pruner/lopping shear. It will do the job and is easier to use than a chain saw but the oiling, clearing and tightening of the chain are a hassle."
1,Not satasfied,"I like the design of the item, but found it lacking for my needs. I was attempting to chop up a large fallen branch today, with the largest piece about 6"" in diameter. I was able to cut the branch, by making two cuts, but while working on the other limbs I had the chain fall off twice, and finally heard a metal-on-metal sound coming from the chain.I need a small chain saw, and this simply will not cut it (har har). If the chain did not fall off so often, I'd keep it for light duty work, but the product is not functional enough for me.If you are doing really light duty cutting, this may work out for you, but if you need a small chain saw, get the real thing, this simply is not adequate."
5,Great Tool,The Black and Decker Loppers work great. They are lightweight and easy to use. They cut thru branches easliy with no effort.
5,This works great for weekend type stuff...,"I've had this a couple of years now and it works great for my needs. I used it again this weekend to clean up from a big snowstorm we had a couple of weeks ago. It chewed up branches up to 5"" thick easily. Ironically, it's the little twig pieces that occasionally will cause the chain to dismount. This has only happened to me twice and was easily fixed with a 1/2"" socket wrench and a little common sense. I have a full size B&D chainsaw I no longer use because this is so much easier and frankly less intimidating. If you're a logger or frequently cutting firewood maybe you more, otherwise it's really handy to have around. I can't recall the last time I added a=oil by the way, of course that's probably not something you want to emulate."
4,Alligator Lopper did the job,"With a yard full of limbs that need to be cut in order to be picked up in the weekly collection I needed some kind of tool. Using a handsaw took too long and I was afraid of using a chain saw even a small one.I give this 4 stars because it met the criteria that I had in mind. First, it wasn't too expensive. Second, I could handle it easily even though I am not very strong. Finally, it cut 4"" branches smoothly with no jerking or hesitation.There's lots of trimming that needs to be done and now I can do it."
4,Alligator Help,"Tool was a little awkward to use at first, but easier with more use. The only draw back I have is it has a tendency to get pinched when cutting a larger branch from the side. Because you can not always have the handles above the branch. Great for small stuff."
3,Works fine,Have used it for about 10 hours of cutting. Works okay. My wife wanted me to get it so she could do some trimming as well. We have 8 acres with an orchard and have always used hand saws and clippers. She will not use the regular chain saw. For the money it works fine. Avoid pinching the blade on larger limbs. I'm not going to give it 5 stars until it makes through a few seasons.
4,THE LOPPER,"The unit performed as advertised, saving time and many muscle aches. It easy to handle, and has excellent safety features, but it takes some time to get the hang of these. Overall it is atool that will get lots of use in theis household."
4,Black & Decker Lopper,Product thus far has performed as described. Have had no problems with item and does very well in cutting branches. Plenty of power and resilence. Works well in and around down branches for cutting smaller for disposal. Would recommend to most everyone.
5,My Little Alligator,"We bought the electric version. Product is very easy to handle. Works very well on small trees, branches. Quick, clean cuts."
2,Under power/jams when cutting small branches,"Used initially to cut down holly like brush, then used it to cut downed scrubs to 12"" length sections to fit in disposal 55 gallons bin. Chain jammed when small twig like branches collected at the sprocket. 4.5 amps is too under powered to effectively cut the larger trunks without first allowing it to gain maximum rpm."
1,Not necessary,I returned this product before I used it. I have chain saws but thought this would be an easy grab-and-go item for smaller jobs. But the thing requires oil every ten minutes of use.....and it takes a little doing to uncover the oil hole and do the job.It just seemed like an expensive toy that would be more trouble than cranking up the chain saw.
1,junk,"lasted less than 5 minutes when it jammed and then broke. Unfortunate for me, it sat on the shelf for two years before I used it."
1,Buyer Beware,"This is in line with my experence with B&D tools, great idea, TERRIBLE Execution. B&D makes tools for only the lightest of use. It is not unusual to get only a year's use of one of their tools and then have to replace it. Critical componets are held in place with thin plastic. Cheap bushings are used rather than bearings. Gears are plastic, not metal. Switches break from normal use. etc. And god forbid you don't drop it, because you'll be toast. My advise is wait for a good company to copy this product and then buy it from them. Based on past history, I'll wait for someone to do this right."
2,why no gas???,"We have been told they make no gas versions of this. It's a brilliant concept and even I can cut wood now! But the power is severely limited being electric. if this ever comes out in gas, they will possibly kill the regular chain saw industry because these are so easyto use, and safe too!"
2,OILING EVERY 10 MINUTES IS RIDICULOUS!!!,"I bought this chain saw, after reading all the reviews & looking at it in action.I am 70 years old, so I was SOLD!It is all TRUE,but if I had known that, I HAVE TO STOP & OIL IT EVERY 10 MINUTES,I WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT IT.!!! Alicia"
2,Not as good as it looks,"It looks practical in the pictures, but when you pull it out of the box it is big and bulky. Quality, I think, is kinda cheesy. I would recommend an electric chain saw instead of this."
4,Heavyweight pruner,"This tool cuts anything up to 2 inches in diameter so far, it is little too heavy to use if you want to cut holding it up for long period, but if its on the gournd, it will do the job. The cutting power is excellent, it cuts without much effort.I bought this thinking it would replace my long handle pruner but like I said, it is little on the heavy side. I just used it couple of times but I am expecting to use it to trim a medium size tree for my next project."
5,Super tool,"We were concerned that the low price of this tool meant it would not do what the manufacturer claimed. We were wrong. It more than does what they claim. Great for trimming 4"" or even up to 5"" limbs off the trees and then cutting them to size and tidying up the side shoots. It has made the 14"" chainsaw that we have, nearly redundant. We are very happy with this little gadget and everyone in the family is able to use it."
4,Overall good,"The electric cord sometimes gets in the way sometimes - catching when I open the jaws (I'm left handed). But this chainsaw doesn't scare me and I don't have to wait for the Mr. to get my smaller (4-5"") limbs cut up to fit the parlor stove."
5,B&Decker Loper,"I ordered a used Loper, which was $10 off the new price. The Loper I got had never been used as near as I could tell. It came in an unopened box, with the original tape sealing it shut. It works great, but have only used it for several hours so far. Replacement chains likely would have to be obtained off the internet, as Lowes or HD don't seem to have that size."
5,A Good Invention,"I have a small gas-powered chain saw and also a gas-powered pole saw. The chain saw is heavy to hold up and I didn't need to use the pole saw for most of my pruning. Based on the reviews, I decided to give this product a try. This tool works really great! It's not super heavy and you don't have to mess with gas since it's electric powered. I've been using mine to trim oleanders with some branches 4"" thick with no problems. Even with ratchet loppers, it's not always possible to cut the thicker branches and the Alligator Lopper solves this problem. You do have to put oil into a small covered hole but you have to oil and chain saw device. The jaws shield the cutters while closed so it's pretty safe to use."
4,Codygal,The product worked very well. It was very safe to use. I am a 62 year old female and I found the loppers a bit heavy but not so heavy I could not use them safetly. I feel is reliable and I would recommend them to my friends.
2,"Great idea, poor execution","After 3 months of very light usage (maybe 20 small branches total), the chain now slips off on the first cut. The tensioner seems to be malfunctioning. Amazon won't exchange it, so I have to go through warranty repair. I would not buy this again."
5,Alligator Lopper Electric Chain Saw,Easy to use. Effective on large branches. Relatively lightweight.
4,LOVE IT!,"I could not wait to get this. Using it to help clear and maintain wooded area of yard. No problems with jamming, easy to use and heavy enough to remind you of it's ability to do damage. My only complaint is that the power cord easily detaches which can be something of a safety feature but nine times out of ten it is somewhat of a hassle. We have a no-chainsaw rule when only one of us is at home but this certainly makes short work of several jobs I would have noramlly used my gas powered chain saw for, making it very convenient to use. Affordable, so go get one today."
1,Hunk of Junk,"Item arrived promptly from Amazon. All items in the box. Followed instructions. Cut 3 branches and the chain fell off. Installing the chain in a 5 hand job. Got the chain back on, and cut 2 more branches before the chain fell off. Took the whole thing to a local hardware store, where the staff uninstalled and reinstalled the chain. They said the original chain was beyond dull. Spent $17.95 for a replacement chain. Went home and had the same problems. Tried the new chain, and again was able to cut two branches before the chain fell off. Sending this back to Amazon. I don't know if I got a completely defective device or what, but a saw that doesn't cut is worthless"
4,Great Purchase!!!,"although there are tasks which only a chain saw can handle, the 'gator is a great at the most common ones a homeowner faces... particularly if the homeowner isn't too keen on storing gasoline in the garage and the inherent dangers of a regular chain saw!!! great for major pruning and clean up... it's a bit awkward when cutting on the horizontal plane because of its center of gravity, but still manageable... would highly recommend to those of us without lumberjack aspirations!!!"
5,"Bought this for my husband, but. . .","I bought this for my husband for Christmas. I thought it looked like a great little tool for the lawn. After mowing yesterday and fighting low hanging limbs, I decided to try it out myself. The Alligator Lopper was still in the box (unopened) in the basement. I opened it up, read the manual (looked easy enough!) and then ran an extention cord to the offending tree. This was so easy even a girl could do it!! I cut the pesky limbs in about five minutes. I put it back in the basement on the shelf (not in the box). When do you think he will notice? Maybe I actually bought for myself?"
4,works good,"I bought this tool because I had a lot of big branches on the ground already; anywere from 1"" to 4"" thickthe lopers worked good. exept that I had a hard time holding the brancheswhile I was cutting, it would have worked better if I did cut them while they were still on the tree, the loper are bigger than it looks on the picand a little awkward but all and all. works good"
4,Alligator Lopper - Just What We Needed!,"This chain-driven lopper is perfect for our yard needs. We rarely need a full-size chain saw, but we have a lot of very large trees and the old-fashioned loppers I had couldn't handle some of the larger branches and limbs that we needed to cut. The Alligator went through limbs of 6 inches in diameter cleanly and quickly. The only negative thing about the Alligator is the electric motor sitting on top - it's just a little top-heavy and you have to be careful to have it at the right angle in order to make a clean cut, but that was not a bad sacrifice to make once it started doing its job. We are very satisfied with it so far."
3,Don't get rid of your chain saw,"I bought this saw to complement my 16"" electric chain saw. This saw gets little use in the end. For small branches, my long handle manual pruner works better. For everything else, my regular chain saw works just as well or better. I guess the added safety factor (perceived?) for this device is the main attraction"
3,Heavier than a small electric chain saw...,The Lopper is more tiring to use. The awkward feeling double handles also contribute to a shorter work period.This machine is safer to use because of the chain guard and the double switches but shouldn't be used after your arms grow weary.Cutting is rapid.
5,useful. well made. excellent safety features.,"Headline or summary (required) is enough, guys.xxxxx x x x x x x x x"
5,Great product,Needed help after recent storm damage to trees. This electric chainsaw stood-up to the task. Please follow oiling and tension recommendations as stated in the manual. This is an excellent light weight saw.
5,Alligator Lopper - GREAT!,"Great tool, it took me 2 hours to trim my crepe myrtles (normally a 2 day job). I can't say enough nice things about this tool. Buy one! You'll be lucky to have it. Maybe buy 2, I already have people trying to borrow this thing."
2,Whoops!,"Perhaps I did not read the description clearly or should have read the reviews. I have an interest in incense and other combustible scents for aromatherapy and atmosphere. For some reason, I thought this would have more 'recipes' but was I wrong. Being an ethnic ""Heinz 57"" I have a lot of interest in different cultures so I found it interesting from that aspect. Being a Protestant Christian however I have say that I was somewhat repelled by all the talk of 'Chakra', 'spirits', and 'Auras'. I also found the mis-spellings in several places distracting. Still, it was a fair book for all that. I will probably put it in my bookstore to resell."
1,Horrible Cinematography,I love this ballet and had high hopes. The quality of the film appears that it was done with a cell phone in the back of the auditorium.I had seen the ballet live when it came to a city near me and was horribly disappointed in this 2009 DVD.
2,Don't buy this one!,"Contained a brief entry on modernism, but not a word about postmodernism. Let alone postcolonialism...A dictionary is no good if it doesn't have the words you want to look up!"
3,More entries,"I wish I could read about the PARADOXISM, a literary avant-garde movement set up in 1980s by Florentin Smarandache and based on antitheses, antinomies, contradictions, paradoxes."
2,Incomplete and Presumptious,"This one is comical, but it lacks some of the basics and makes leaping statements. Perhaps that just makes it appropriately titled...its Debbi's notebook afterall. Readers should consider the TITLE seriously while reading. Lots of judgement based statements...."
5,"Immediate, powerful, the one book on astrology to own","Debbie Kempton Smith's Secret's from a Stargazer's Notebook is an exorcise in clarity cutting through the fuzzy and obscure descriptions found in many astrology reference books. With humor, grace and wit she takes the reader on a journey from the basics of astrology to a deeper understanding of the art. One of the many delights in the book is the way she revels an aspect of astrology through an example (a story) of how it manifested in someone's life. Astrology may have a focus on the stars but Debbie Kempton Smith brings it all down to earth. If you've ever been frustrated with the vagaries of astrology than this is the book to get. If you can get hold of a copy. I've owned two copies that now exist in other people's libraries. The next copy I get stays in my own hands. No mercy to would be borrowers! My advice is to get two copies and keep one of them a secret. I give it 6 stars."
5,Publisher: Thanks for bringing it back...,"As a psychic astrologer and astrology teacher of twenty years Ihave used this book and recommended it again and again. My clientsand students always came back thanking me for that recommendation. So imagine my dismay when I heard from some of them that it was out of print. It is so witty, so wise, and so much fun to read, it's the perfect introduction for those wanting to go a little further than the (wonderful, yes, but not really advanced) Linda Goodman. In any case, thanks to the publisher for wisely bringing it back. Now I have some calls to make - I want to tell those disappointed clients and students that they can, indeed, buy the book ""For those who don't have all day to figure out tomorrow."""
5,Works and Works well,"Ms. Kempton Smith's witty notebook is more than just entertainment - it is full of insights that would not be easily revealed by most other astrology books. Stargazer's Notebook presents its reader with practical, easy-to-use knowledge that rings true time and again. When read aloud at parties, eyebrows are arched and vigorous nods are provoked at the truisms that apply to each individual and their charts. At last, a guideline that manages to explain some of the more mysterious character traits within ourselves and others in our lives - be they family, friends or celebrity (the celeb charts contained within are especially fascinating). Both a fun read as well as a reference."
3,Suite Bergamasque....Sergei Bergamasque,"I heard only the last two pieces from the Suite Bergamasque (on the radio), and though I was impressed immediately by the pianism, I began to find myself irritated by the absence of Debussy. Where is the stillness, the sense of motionlesness, the zen-like clarity? If you like Debussy played like it were Prokofiev, this is your recording."
2,Cheap,"It's cheaper than it looks. Lucky for me it was a gag gif for a 50 year old Barbie nut who wanted a new Jewelery Box. But the drawers are sticky, and have edges. I wouldn't buy this for a child."
5,WWF Survivor Series 95,"I bought this video for 25 bucks.It's a lot of money but I thinkit's worth of buying it,if you're a huge wrestling fan.Here are the matches.Match 1.Marty Jannety,Bob Holly,Hakushi&Barry; Horowitzvs 1-2-3 Kid,Tom Prichard,Skip&Rad; Radford.8/10Match 2.Alundra Blayze,Sakie Hasegawa,Kyoko Inoue&Chapparita; Asari vs Bertha Faye,Aja Kong,Tomoko Watanabe&Lioness; Asuka.6/10Match 3.Bam Bam Bigalow vs Goldust.6/10Match 4.The Dark Side(Undertaker,Fatu,Henry Godwin&Savio; Vega)vs The Royals(King Mabel,Jerry ""the king"" Lawler,Isaac Yankem&Hunter Hearst Helmsly.8/10Match 5.The Wildcard BoutShawn Michaels,Ahmed Johnson,Sid&British; Bulldogvs Owen Hart,Yokozuna,Razor Ramon&Dean; Douglas.9/10Match 6.WWF Championship.Diesel vs Bret ""the hitman"" Hart.9/10"
3,WWF Survivor Series 1995 review,"The BodyDonnas-The Underdogs match was not great but pretty good and the same goes for the 8 Divas tag team elimination match. The Goldust-Bam Bam Bigelow match while not a bad bout,I still think of it as a match that should have happened on RAW or Superstars. The Darkside-The Royals match was nothing more then a one sided comedy flop. The ""WildCard"" match was nothing more then a ""Big Lipped Alligator Moment"". The World championship match between Bret Hart & Diesel(Kevin Nash) was a solid/hard-hitting showstealer. I give this event a 6 out of 10."
5,Must have for designers!!!!!!,Very informative and loaded with pictures of gorgeous fabrics from one of the top fabric design houses in the world. A must have for designers or anyone in the interior design business who deal with high end fabrics and trims on a regular basis. Would highly recommend this book!!!!
5,Stands out,"For those designers and high scale clientèle, who appreciate and enjoy the luxury of classical interiors."
5,Lush & beautiful,"Love this book! I was afraid it may cover too much of the fabric industry, but it doesn't. While it does start out with an introduction to the fabric house & its history, it focuses primarily on the beautiful & LUSH interiors their fabrics create. A wonderful aspiration/dream book for those of us that don't have thousands to spend on fabric alone. It's also a fantastic IDEA book! I love the large scale of this one and it's quickly become one of my favorite additions to my design library. Also great for someone like me that's in design school!"
5,Truly Inspiring,"As a veteran programmer (on *nix, MS and Mac) I have read many ""history of,"" ""biography of,"" ""story of"" books, and I've enjoyed a lot of them. However, I can think of none that inspired me as much as this book. I thought it was very well-researched, incredibly entertaining, and, as I've already mentioned, truly inspiring. I don't see how any programmer could read this book and not want to go out and immediately develop something new, unique and revolutionary. For that matter, I don't see how anyone whose just interested in computers and technology could read this book and not want to immediately want to learn how to program. While I was reading it, I couldn't shut up about how great it was. Since I finished it, I find myself still thinking about it a lot--and I still can't shut up about it! I really don't think it matters what your techno-political background is, if you love programming, computers or just technology in general, I think you'll really enjoy this book."
3,"nice title, shame about the plot","so i was surprised by this book. i thought it would venture journalist opinion about non tech matters - in fact, it takes at pretty much face value the self-evaluation of the people, and ventures opinions on tech. matters that are inappropriate - a bit like the hero-worship in the New New thing; like a couple of other reviewers, i found the slightly disjointed ""storyline"" a bit tricky (and i like thomas pynchon:-); and i agree with one of the others comments that some sort of critical comment/assessment about timeing (dotcom-ism) might have been interesting...anyhow, it was still a very well researched and interesting read, and to date, the best thing about the linux phenomenonoh, HATE the cover :-("
2,Nice cover - Couldn't care less about Linux...,"I like the cover, but nothing could interest me less than Linux or any software that ends with ..ux, ok maybe an IBM anthology of punch-card machines would be less interesting.To me the best thing about Linux is that it comes as a free CD on the cover of magazines providing me with an endless supply of coffee casters."
5,Great book!,"For those interested in the origins of free software and Linux, this is a great book to read on. It describes chronologically all the people that became involved in the developing of linux operating system, the thoughts and beliefs of these greatest hackers."
2,Not for those who have already read Keirsey's Temperament Sorter,"After readingPlease Understand Me II: Temperament, Character, Intelligence, I was excited to read other books that dealt with these concepts to help me process my new realizations about human temperament patterns. Unfortunately, I was disappointed by People Patterns because the book consisted of an oversimplified repetition of what was already contained in Keirsey's book. The only new contribution made by Montgomery is that he indicates the temperaments of a number of fictional characters (although some of his characterizations are debatable).Despite these shortcomings, I might recommend this book to someone unfamiliar with Keirsey's work, but would be more likely to recommend Keirsey's book itself due to its more comprehensive coverage on temperaments."
1,"""Please Understand Me II"" for dummies","If you've read-and understood-David Keirsey's Please Understand Me II-then don't buy this book. Don't even think about buying this book. Go read Keirsey's. If you tried to read Please Understand Me II, and couldn't understand it, then read this book.The author uses the same descriptions-often the same phrases- and really doesn't add much to Keirsey's book at all. It is just a simpler version. If Keirsey isn't getting a cut from this book, it's probably the most blatant copyright violation in the world. (And if you are getting a cut, Mr. Keirsey-then please don't leave reviews and fail to mention that fact. It's misleading).This book is simplistic and brief. It's the USA Today version of a NY Times article. It's the movie version of a literary classic. It's the cliff notes of Keirsey's book. And, in this reviewer's opinion, it's not worth buying."
3,One more way to figure us out,"I'm not sure what to say about yet another ""help"" book, but this one is interesting and gives a fun way to explain our everyday dynamics to the people with whom we work, live and play, but NOT to ""pigeon-hole"" those same people. I think the book is worth having, if only to get a better look at ourselves. I'd like to add another ""half star"" to the three I gave it."
1,disappointing book,"I was very disappointed in this book - as I was looking for a true dictionary, one that would give the definition of the word. This book would be useful only for those medical personnel who needed to learn the terms in either english or spanish. The editorial review describes this book as defining the words in it and it does not - very misleading."
4,Entertaining,Mr. Barfknecht's book is pretty entertaining. It's especially interesting when you know you've been to an area that is mentioned as a site of supernatural occurrances.
5,Great Book!,"This book is an awesome read, especially if you're a Michigan native. I learned a lot reading this book; there were lots of things I never knew happened in my great home state. I go back and read my favorite stories over and over. A must-read for all Michiganders!"
3,Tales of Oddity,"This book is an easy read - the stories are not lengthy. They are entertaining. They do however lack depth, seem lacking in some details."
5,Great Stuff!,"This book is one you won't be able to put down! If you like Ghosts, Paranormal, and a host of other unexplained mysteries...you will love this book especially if Michigan is home to you. Be sure you're not alone when you start your journey into the pages of this book. Author Gary Barfknect, in an interview I conducted with him while writing this book, explained the painstaking research that was involved in documenting the accounts he relays. One specific story about the Watersmeet Lights (aka PAULDING LIGHTS) I, after reading the book, experienced myself....incredable!"
4,More Wagner and Politics of Race,"There are people who love demolition derbeys and people who love fires and people facinated with Wagner. I am also into being Welsh and knew about Winifred Williams who represents the more innocent side of nationalism and its ideals of peoples and place. Wales is the ideal of this ideal and the heart of this many peopled book of egos and the convolutions of high art with the gutter, is the pricess and the pirate story. As a book, its the first real deal in years... inexpensive. If you are any sort of 20th century WW I and WW II era student this is of interest and value. Through Winifred we see how the Hitlers of history worm into our intellects and better natures."
3,Hark the herald . . . housekeeper?,"When widower Bret Bishop loses his trusty housekeeper to an injury right at the beginning of the Christmas season, he hardly expects her replacement to be as attractive, as mysterious, as strangely familiar as beautiful Noelle St. Nichols. Nor does he expect his youngest son to insist that Noelle is an angel . . .Which, of course, in this feel-good Christmas story, is exactly what she is. Actually, she's the angel who's presided over the Bishops' Christmas tree for years. And at the end we have the standard dilemma: go back to heaven or stay with the family (and especially the man) she has fallen for.Nice enough, but nothing exceptional, and actually a little crude in a place or two."
4,Indeed It Was An Invasion,"I remember the Turkish invasion of Cyprus and it was just that, an invasion. The island and its status has been a point of military contention between the Christian and Islamic worlds for centuries.The book may have its faults,as any book of such scope likely will, but the author's use of the term invasion is not one of them."
5,Why must I ask,"Why must park be so under rated when they are better then some bands out there... It just makes me ask why. Like why is it so hard to find and like why is it mixed amongst all these linkin park albums... That is all besides the point. Park is a great band expesically if you like the Hot Rod Circuit, because I think that they sound a lot alike. But they each have there own style that makes their music a lot better. What Im trying to say is go buy this cd by park cause if you don't you won't have it..."
5,Enchanting children's tale,"I first read this at some young age long enough ago that I can't remember exactly when, but I remember very well the sense of awe and enchantment of the story. Even now, many many years later, I can pick it up and be just as engrossed even though it's such a short read. Highly recommended for all ages, if you enjoy a magical tale that somehow seems real, along with the very real story of a young boy's emergence into adulthood."
5,"An excellent book, reccommended for all ages","the best book and an added bonus of finally finding my name, i especially love all the characters and the way that everyone in their own magical way is a beautiful character"
4,Cheap but excellent,"Maybe not the best inauguration to John Cage, but also one not to be overlooked. If you like being alone sometimes, listening to your windchimes outside the window while contemplating anything from the matter of your existence, to how to dislodge a rust encrusted cotter pin from your automatic transmission shifter -- but the wind happens to be in short supply -- put this guy on. It's seeming randomness has a likeable windchiime like quality -- only instead of lowly teak or aluminim tubes, think of a grand piano hanging from the porch being tickled by the breeze. Good for what ails you. I like it."
4,Cheap Imitation,"An interesting college appearance by Cage. The music is a very meditative, almost ethereal solo piano performance by Cage on a wonderfully-sounding piano. He lets the brilliant harmonics of the notes ring out following somewhat exotic progressions almost absent-mindedly. Truely an minimal performance that has more in common with ambient music than say, indeterminism, but it does have a bit of that as well in the progression of the pieces. There is also that wandering aspect of Satie that is, of course, prevalent throughout the recording. Not a cheap imitation, but a rich tribute.From reading the album notes, apparently there was a rainstorm pounding the roof during the performance. If you listen very closely you can hear it, but it is a very good recording so you can barely hear the rumbling and pounding in the background. A worthwhile recording, but not recommended for those new to Cage."
4,"14 Junkies , Too Weak To Work","Some sell diamonds for what their worth , down on pain street , disapointment lurks . I hope someday Neil releases this LP on CD.'Till then I'll have to get by with the CD I've burned from the vinyl. My all-time favorite Neil Young LP of all time , side one is seared into my brain.From the afformentioned first lines of ""Time Fades Away"" to ""Yonder Stands the Sinner"" ( He calls your name...without a sound ) to the mellow strains of ""L.A."" and ""Love In Mind"" , this first side is the best live Neil ever recorded. Side two serious's up a bit but still shines.This is Neil's 'Running On Empty' , a tour record of unreleased songs done live. Everybody was expecting the sequelto Harvest , they got this instead. Compared to Harvest this LP was vastly misunderstood , however on it's own it may very well be one of the top three records Neil has ever done.My favorite Neil Young album and the one I can't wait to be released on CD. Worth every effort to find on LP or cassette."
4,Free Download,"See the posts on Buddyhead.Com, they have made the whole album available for download, god bless 'em."
5,Lost Gem,"It's really a travesty that this album is not available on CD. I have an old vinyl LP that I've transferred to the computer, pops, clicks and all. As other reviewers say, this album is superior to much of what Neil released in the 1980s. My favorites here are L.A., Love in Mind, Don't Be Denied, The Bridge and Times Fade Away. I don't think there's a bad song here. The tone of the recording is pretty stripped down and raw. It's good, classic stuff. Also a great cover and liner notes. Buy this CD if it is ever released!"
3,Good but not one of his best,"I saw a concert in Long Beach during the 1973 tour when this was recorded and looked forward to the album. That said, I sold it it to used record store after about a year (along with Harvest which grew lessi interesting for other reasons). The title track is great, but compared to his still imporant post-Harvest, mid 70s albums-- Tonight's the Night, Stars and Bars, or Zuma (Let alone Rust Never Sleeps or his first solo album--albums I never would have sold and still have, it's not the classic many claim in my view. The sound was crappy as I recall. If it gets rereleased I will download the title song and Don't Be Denied and leave it at that but in this case I think Neil Young realizes it was not up to his level overall."
1,Didn't do anything,"I installed this hoping it would mollify my hot starting issue, no difference. That's it, nothing else to say about the product."
2,not worth the extra money,We have 4 girls and keeping them feed and healthy is important for my 10 yr old. He spent his allowance on what. We thought was healthier food . it was eaten in 1/2 the time as our other less expensive food .
2,Very tiny.,"Thought the quality was lacking for the price of the book. I do love Maurice Sendak, don't get me wrong."
3,Binding is not very good,The little book 4.5 x 6 is very well done for alphabet learning. I was disappointed with the binding. The pages are cut short on the bottom so that some of the letters have been cut off. I bought the more expensive binding but the soft copy may be a better buy.
2,Not age appropriate,"Of course we have ""Where the Wild Things Are"", and its fantastic. When Sendak died I looked at the reviews for Alligators All Around and thought it would be good too. The illustration is terrible. Very few things even allude to the fact that its the same person creating the books. Also, the concepts on each page are too abstract for a child learning their ABC's to understand. I would think a child would need to be 3 or 4 to start to understand the concepts of what is happening on the pages, but kids start learning ABCs before that. So, by the time they can understand the captions, they already know their ABCs. Simply using alliteration for weird actions doesn't make it clever or cute either. It is interesting that you follow the alligator family through the book, but that would also be lost on a child."
2,Need to improve their casting,"Bought these to do a complete swap out of all the brakes on a '03 Neon. Front pads were a breeze, rear shoes were ok. Once I tightened everything up, set the adjuster, put it on the ground and took it for a spin, there was a horrible grinding noise out of the right rear. Took it off, made sure I had not flipped the order of the shoes, adjusted it again, and no dice. Ended up putting the old ones back on. These had extra backing plate material that was just enough to grind into the drum."
3,Misleading Product Description,"I have not yet read this work but feel compelled to note that the statement in the editorial product description, that ""Sir Gawain and the Green Knight"" ""received acclaim from the peasantry of its time for its commentary regarding important socio-political and religious concerns"" is absurd. First, the ""peasantry"" of the time did not read chivalric romances, for they could not read. Secondly, the poem exists in the unique manuscript British Library Cotton Nero A.x, and there is no mention of it until the seventeenth century and hardly acclaimed by anyone until the nineteenth century. Information on how the poem comments on the ""socio-political and religious concerns"" of the 14th century may or may not be found in this collection of essays, but it is doubtful that the author of the product description couldn't tell us."
4,"Great little booster seat, best for dogs under 8-9lbs","This car seat is really great. It is really easy to assemble (although it doesn't fit on the double-seat of the back seat in my Jeep due to the fact that the straps wrap around the seat in two places to secure the booster). This was perfect for my yorkie-shihtzu Rocky while a puppy. He loved to sit in the seat (which has a strap that secures to his collar) as well as lay down in it and sleep. The small model says that it fits dogs up to 11 lbs, however, at 9lbs, he seemed to have outgrown it- he would get really hot trying to lay down and start panting. I have the medium-size model now which is much more appropriate for an 11lb dog. Would definitely recommend, however, try sizing-up, especially if buying for a puppy."
3,Pet Booster Seat,"My dog loves car rides..but only if he can be in the driver seat and looking out window. Knowing this I decided to purchase a car seat for him because we were going to be going on a trip and being this would be his first long car ride, I wanted him to be safe and comfortable.I liked everything about car seat except it was a little to small for him to lay down and relax so he wasn't too thrilled with it. Overall not a bad product, just not for me and my dog."
3,Not crazy about it,"I didn't care for this seat. It takes me too long to put the seat into the car and I find the clip hard to work and very cheap. My dog is small, only 6 pounds, and I have a hard time getting the clip to attach to my dog's harness. My dog is very patient and lets me fiddle around trying to get the clip hooked in. I can't imagine trying to clip in a very antsy dog. The front part of the seat doesn't stand up right even after I move around the straps. My dog can sit in it fine and it doesn't seem to bother him, but it drives me crazy that the front part of the seat won't stand up right. I originally wanted to use this seat in and out of different cars, but I just don't have the patience to fiddle with straps over and over again. Overall it does do the job but I wish it was better quality and not so annoying to put in."
5,Great Car Seat for Pet,"I purchased this car seat at a local pet store. Once my friend saw it she just had to have one. I ordered her one from PPE when I saw it on the internet. My pet loves her car seat, I just wish I had purchased on PPE, I would have save enough to purchase another item."
4,Easy in/out,"I have a yorkie mix puppy who is afraid to ride in the car and would distract me from driving I bought this seat so she could both be securely fastened into the seat along with being able to see out the window. She feels better about riding in the car now and does enjoy seeing the scenary as we drive. My only complaint is that the front of the seat does sag a little. The bottom seems sturdy and there are enough straps to be able to adjust the seat to the correct height. Once the seat is in place, it is very easy to put my dog in and take her out of the seat. There is a strap to fasten her harness to and so far she hasn't been able to jump out at ll.Overall it was a good purchase and does the job I needed it to do."
5,Terrific car seat,"I bought this for my porkie 12 pound Pomeranian and we are extraordinarily happy with it. She used to be a ridiculous nightmare in the car, because she wants to see outside and she wants to be close to me. She fits great, has room to turn around, can curl up and sleep in it, and she can easily see out the window. She always wears her harness which attaches to a clip on the device so she can't jump out. We drive for hours and she is very content and comfortable (of course we stop periodically for walkabouts). If I have a passenger, I hang the dog's car seat on the back of the passenger seat and she faces the back. That way, she's still close to me and she can still see outside. The bottom strap of the car seat has never interfered with my passengers' comfort in the front. It's lightweight, the straps are super easy to adjust, and it's secure and affordable. Terrific choice. I highly recommend this device."
2,Broke within 3 months of purchase!,"Maybe I got a lemon, but the clip that latches onto the harness/collar broke within 3 months of purchase. I originally purchased this so my dogs would not wander out of the seat while I ran errands and during roadtrips. Now that they have no way of being latched into the seat, it's completely useless, what a waste of money!"
2,Not ideal but it will do,"This car booster seat seemed promising at first, but there are many pitfalls. My rat terrier (7 lbs) is very crowded in the car seat. There is enough room for her to sit but really not enough room to get comfortable. The car seat was a hand-me-down from a Havanese (think Shiz Tsu) who was WAY too big for the car seat. The car seat gets hot. Very hot. There's not enough room for the dog to have a chew toy or anything to keep her occupied. It's not difficult to assemble, but it is difficult to dis-assemble if you need the seat. And lastly, one of the clips broke. So the seat cannot stay propped up, it sinks to the base of the chair. The car seat works fine as a place to just lock your dog in, but the dog can't see out the window."
4,FRESHWATER PEARL ANKLER,"THE ANKLET LOOKED FINE; EXCEPT, I GUESS I THOUGHT IT WAS STRUNG ON THREAD INSTEAD OF WIRE. ALL IN ALL, THEY WERE OKAY."
2,Button positions,"This would be a good alarm clock, escept for the button positions. For some reason the designer put the 24hour alarm reset button right next to the small snooze button. Everytime I tried to press snooze and get a few more minutes of sleep, I turned the alarm clock off.In the end I bought a funky rooster alarm clock with a huge snooze button and a chinese accent. It's weird, but it works great. This one has been relegated to the garage.It's a good radio; it's a good CD player; it's a good clock; it even looks cool, but it' not a good alarm clock."
5,family favorite,My husband and I have used these for many years now. And over the years this has become the most requested christmas gift from our children and grandchildren. They are durable and realible. I will be adding 2 more grandchildren to the screamer fan club this year. i would recoment this to anyone.
4,"It's loud, and reliable.","The only thing preventing me from giving this product five stars is that the alarm goes off ten minutes before the set time. Why? It seems like an unnecessary thing to think about when you're setting an alarm. Other than that, it works well."
4,Wake up call,I am hard of hearing and could not get an alarm loud enough to wake me until I found Screaming Meanie. Now I set the timer to the number of hours that would pass from the setting time until the hour I must awaken and it never fails me. I had no idea where to purchase the timer and contacted Amazon. My problem was solved.
3,WRONG COLORS,The clocks work fine so far---but---I ordered them for my son because he couldn't find any colors except green and yellow which he considers less than masculine---these were supposed to be red and/or blue with no option choice. When I received these they came surprise surprise :/ yellow and green. So we are not happy about that but we didn't want to pay to send them back so he sucked it up!
2,Listen before you buy,"I simply did not enjoy any songs on this tribute. Most of the tracks had a folky/hippy sound that just didnt fit. The music of Elliott Smith has a kind of feeling that this cd failed to capture. On the other hand, none of the tracks offered any kind of unique or interesting take on the original versions. Its nice to see the music living on but I wish I would have heard a little of this cd before I bought it."
3,"Good, but not his best",I was a bit disappointed in this entry in the House of Winslow series. Trying to fit three stories into one book seems to make all of them a bit too shallow. I never bought Esther's nickname as the Iron Lady. Even in the beginning of the book she didn't seem as hard as the characters said she was. I loved the character of Esther and her relationship with Jan. Ruth and Dr. Burns were enjoyable to read about as well. I don't enjoy Morris cramming a whole list of current events into each book. They seem out of place at times. I also really enjoyed the character of Priscilla and looked forward to reading the sequel starring her as the Silver Star.
2,Not what I expected,"This book is only for amateurs that jus want to get in a little bit shape with some techniques here and there. I recomed for the most serious warrior "" TAO OF JEET KUNE DO"" by Bruce Lee. This book is awesome, very well detail. You go from exercises to techniques to the real combat form."
4,Solo training,"It's not a book for people who trains alone, but for teachers that want the best for their students. Both volumes are very complete!"
1,Pretty useless book,I've been training martial arts of various forms for close to ten years. There is really no valuable information in this book unless you are entirely untrained in any fighting skill and have no instructor. Anyone who has trainined with a proficient instructor could train solo using whatever drills were provided by their instructor. Anyone who has trained with an instructor for 2+ years could probably make up training exercises that are more useful than the drills in this book. I was thoroughly disappointed after reading through it the first time. I put the book on the shelf and a few months later returned to it for assistance in changing around my solo training and was disappointed again.
2,"Catching Title, Interesting Observations, Lacking Validity","While Holtz's book presents itself as an eye-catching, attractive possibility to understanding the increasingly complex world of Generation X, its arguments are redudant and shallow, to the point one begins to wonder what personal agenda fuels the book's arguments. It offers some statistics, but only enough to support its current argument, and fails to consider the collective picture. There are some interesting observations that made me say ""Yeah, I could buy that with more to go on..."" but lack significant follow up or substantiation with the social, cultural, economic, or political developments of the past and present. I read this when it was published in 1995 at the age of 18 and have to admit I was disappointed. The study of the first generation of postmodern America is a burgeoning, but arduous area of study, one Holtz does not treat fairly."
3,Don't Cry For Me X Generation,"What a grim depressing litany of sorrows this book ensconces. Every possible social problem is extrapolated outwards to encompass an entire generation with its' taint. Could one group of people (referred here tongue and cheek as ""The Free,"" echoing the supposed social freedom from guilt, ect. of this group) possibly be so screwed up? I doubt it. Still if you feel Gen X needs someone to whine in a learned tone about it's woes, this is the book!"
2,Not worth 13 dollars,"Didn't particularly care for the carving kit. The tools weren't very sturdy, broke while carving and the stencils were just on plain paper like you could almost have copied it from somewhere else. Nothing special about it."
1,not what i expected,"If you're looking for traditional snowflake patterns, look elsewhere. i bought this snowflake book along with 2 others. of the 3, i didn't even use this one because i was so dissatisfied with the patterns. they don't even really look like snowflakes, and they're just not very pretty in my opinion. If you want a more traditional looking snowflake, i bought the following book and really liked it:Make Your Own Paper Snowflakes"
5,"Simply put, thsi is a great CD of rockabilly...","Though I recomend Snake Ranch as a 1st purchase for thsi artist, thsi is another exellent cd which is recomended if you like to hear waht Patsy Cline might have sounded liek had she been a rockabilly star! Great msuic great backup band, and even a Brian sezter swing tune, Your The Boss"
5,Perfection!,Absolute perfection! I have to say that Brom's voice is magical! The tone is rich and vibrant. You will be enchanted from beginning to end. Every note is like a fine wine ... and it gets better every time you listen.
1,Absolutely Dreadful!,"This is an absolutely dreadful DVD. Poor quality, washed out picture, droning narration, sad places visited and to top it off, it doesn't really cover the whole route of 66! Starts in California and ends in Arizona...what a rip off. Don't waste any money on this one."
2,Go with the 550-cord!!,Don't expect much out of this cord. Doesn't even burn right when trying to seal an end from fraying.
4,Now you too can walk on air,"The Greatest American Hero is probably one of the campiest television shows in history. I love it. I was so thrilled that I found this shirt. It is soft and comfortable.The only thing on this shirt is the logo from the ""suit"", there is nothing on the back or the sleeves. It is just the symbol from Ralph Hinkley's alter ego's disguise. This means that if someone isn't familiar with the show, this shirt might seem moot.I will wear this shirt proud and not really think twice if I lost the instructions or not."
2,Not so loving Sex,Too much talk and not enough action. You'll get more for your money elsewhere. Try renting at the adult section in your local video store or shop Adam and Eve or another site. This DVD is a waste of your money
4,Good product,"I like these pumps, but like any pump, they require cleaning every so often. The less frequently you use them, the more you need to clean them, especially with the white choc sauce. I wrap the opening to the white choc pump with plastic wrap to keep it from drying out. Just remember, you are using a sugar liquid with this... it may crystallize and need to be cleaned with hot water =)"
1,RIP OFF!!!,"If you buy these sauces directly from Ghirardelli, they send you a free pump with every bottle. Don't pay for one!"
4,bermuda triangle,book is very informative and written so that young readers can understand what is happening. grandson enjoys hearing the stories.
1,BEWARE - disturbing photos!,"I have many, many DK readers in all levels and this is the first I am dissapointed in. Yes it tells about the Bermuda Triangle, but it has some distrubing pictures. The description says for 7 and up or 2nd grade. Well I bought this for my 9 year old and am returning it because of the pictures. The most distrubing pictures are when they talk about it being a grave yard. There is a ship with blood just pooling out into the water and then on the next page is a picture of a skeleton/ghost - very distrubing. Now if you like that really freaky halloween stuff then the picture won't bother you, but as an adult I had trouble looking at the picture. I will try to post some picture so you can decide for yourself. The pictures could have been done differently."
3,Met my needs.,My wife was born in 1942 and we thought this dvd would be of interest at her birthday party. It captured key events of that year.
3,Runs out of steam halfway,A stellar ranger on an out of the way planet finds himself trying to single handedly stop a drug smuggling ring. While the concept is interesting the story peters out at about the halfway point.
4,Stellar Rangers,A rollicking space opera. High Noon in outer space. The story line is tight and completely believable. Stellar Ranger comes to town to investigate mysterious happenings and finds more than he bargained for. Finds very few will help him but is able to complete his assignment anyway. Steve Perry has a way with words and this novel follows in the tradition of his others. A good read for those who want an entertaining story without an excess of technological wizardry.
4,Cowboy Motif In Space,"Stellar Ranger by Steve PerryNote, this is not Stellar Ranger Lone Star by the same author.Steve Perry defies tradition by setting up a plot that depicts a future lawman in a western mode. Oddly enough it works.Cinch Carston is a lawman of the old school who sees himself as an arbitrator of justice not just a peace maker. One of the more appealing aspects of Perry's characters is a lack of ambivalence. Good is good and bad is bad. This is an older book that may realize a resurrection with Harrison Ford's Cowboys and Aliens movie debuting this summer.This is not a taxing read but it is entertaining.I recommend it."
4,Wanda DeJesus was great !!!!!,"That is how a mother should protect her children and she was just perfect. I like her when she was in CSI miami and didn't like when she left. The son was okay, not what I expected out of bhim. Neverthe less he was good."
5,illegal tender,"this movie was touching, and I did not see it as a venue for Puerto Rican Acting....I hav watched it more than 2x!!! The ending was moving and I lamost wanted to give her son a hug...I guess you know I am a FEMALE!!! MEN ENJOY THIS TOO.."
3,Mediocre,"I would not compare this movie to Scarface-whatsoever, Scarface was brutal-this movie was bubblegum compared to Scarface. It was just okay-there were a few moments of suspense but other than that movie was mediocre and the acting could be a bit awkard at times. However, Rick Gonzalez was pleasing to my eyes."
1,...illegle to Distribute this film.,The positive reviews must be from people involved with this film and who might profit.One of the worst films ever...does not make any sense at all.Comparing this to Scarface....please. Scarface is a msterpiece compared to this. I am not saying Scarface is a masterpiece.Terrible acting. The little boy in the film is by far the best actor of the bunch.The young girl in the film is plain irritating. I wish she had been offed.Dialogue is just terrible.....Don't waste your time or money on this 'Redemption' flick.
2,Just plain bad,"I have to agree that whoever liked this film either has a stake in it or knows very little about movies. Other than the fact that Wanda was REALLY hot, it was honestly ridiculous. The acting was terrible, the plot waa hole-ridden, and it made no sense whatever. If I were Hispanic, I'd be ashamed of this thing."
2,Bad on so many levels,"This is one of those movies that makes you wonder why you wasted 2hrs watching it. The acting is horrible, the storyline is beyond ridiculous, and I felt nothing for any of the characters. I won't give the ending away but when you finally find out why the PR mafia is after this woman and her kids you'll want your money back. I saw it for free and I feel that I was ripped off. On the plus side, the women in the movie are hot so its not a total waste but really I can't believe this was actually in theatres."
4,Legal Tender DVD,Great DVD. Full of action and suspense. I've been meaning to watch this since it was in the theater a few years ago. I was surprised to find it for under $5.00 on Amazon. I couldn't lose at that price.
4,Good Movie,I watched this movie on TV and had to buy it. Found it hear for cheap and I got it faster than I thought.
4,it wasn't that bad!,"i saw this movie for the first time about 2 years ago, and i must say that for a gory slahser movie, it was pretty good. most horror movies are cheaply made and stupid, but i really liked this one. sure, it had its mistakes(the traditional, never-die-on-the-first-300-tries routine, or trying to use fire on a scarecrow(ha ha) but it wasn't as bad as some people are making it out to be."
2,Great example of a horrible film...,"...and here at Ferncliff Hall we loved every minute of it. Some of the best death of straw incidents we've ever witnessed in a film. Many a cringe was had at the ""my seed"" parts, and the sewing shut of the mouth caused a good deal of mirth in our tiny dorm room. All and all, not a complete waste of time if not taken seriously."
1,a horrible movie,"This movie is ok but most of the movie is stupid.the movie is about a bad spirt that escapes from under a cornfeild because some kids bust open his tomb.The spirt goes inside a scarecrow and comes alive.He kills to find his book of magic spells that will change him to his human form so no one can stop him.This movie is Z rated and the fact the way the scarecrow does most of his killing by turning them into scarecrows(Making sticks,hay,or weeds come out of them.)makes this movie a peice of garbage."
1,one star- and only because I couldn't choose any lower,"This was utterly the worst movie I have ever seen. I ended up laughing more at it's stupidity than getting scared. If you would like to see a well acted, well written and scary movie rent either ""Scream"" or ""Scream 2"". But do not waste your time or money on this terrible excuse for a horror film."
2,"How about a little fire, Scarecrow","I rented this movie thinking that it might possibly be a good, low budget movie. Was I wrong!! It started out to have a good plot line, and interesting characters, but then it went down hill, and was unable to hold my interest"
3,Did I miss something,"I rented this movie a few years back with a girlfriend of mine. We were young, naive and in search of a BAD horror movie. We told the clerk at the movie store this and he directed us to Night of the Scarecrow. Scary enough for a few high school girls when *gasp* why is everyone getting naked?! HA corrupted by the video guy. This movie was so bad that we couldn't stop watching. Like the old car crash adage. We couldn't turn it off. I think it started to have a plot, as far as B movies go but the end left me wondering now what? am I the only one who didn't ""get"" it?!!! Is there a sequel??!!! does anyone care??!!!! I do! What happened to the naked chic?? why was she naked in a barn??! wasnt she itchy? all in all this is a great movie if you plan on having a few drinks before you watch it. its ten times better."
5,"Ultra-Romantic, technically a breeze","Like other reviewers I had thought the Ashkenazy recording was unbeatable but this CD arrived as if it were a secret gif from another planet. WHAT A RECORDING! The problem with the Erude-Tableaux (for me, at least) has always been those internal rhythms and secondary melodies as well as the sheet technical demands on the interpreter.I still think that Etude-Tableaux #5 (E Flat Minor) is sheer nectar in the hands of van Cliburn with his rhythmic churning but this comes close. Each note is crystal clear even in the passages that seem to overwhelm the listener. This is music for the ages and it is difficult to select a ""favorite"".Right off the bat let me say that there are NO bad recordings, no obvious errors in either interpretatin or notes. They could have issued this with a guarantee. The sound is lush, romantic to the nth degree and very sophisticated. But it!!"
4,Worthwhile,This is a beautiful picture book with a sweet message. Perfect as a gift for a new baby sibling if the the siblings are one boy and one girl as in the song and book. It may seem long to little ones the first time around but they'll ask for it again.
3,Boring Book,"It may be beautiful poetry with stunning pictures, but kids are bored by the book. I read the book once to my children and they have refused to ever listen to it again. They like fun stories, not sappy stuff."
1,What a waste of time,"This company waited over a week to cancel their order with me. They said they had the wrong sku and price on the Item but it's still listed here. Shady business or technology challenged? Sorry I used them, no breeches, no apology, no customer service tact."
2,Nothing special,"If you really want to read it, you probably will end up doing so. I read an uncomplimentry review of the book in the Washington Post, but proceeded to buy and read the book anyway. I think the concept is what is so intruiging - who has read Lolita and not wondered what was going on through little Lo's head the entire time? But having read Lo's Diary I found it terribly dissapointing, so unimaginative and lacking in great prose - especially compared to Lolita! - that it becomes worthless. I read the entire thing, and although there were a few good parts (the part that is quoted on the back of the book is one of the few exceptional lines) there is truly nothing in it that sheds any more light on Lolita."
2,Eat it up like candy!,"I wanted to love this book and hoped it would be worthy of its origins. It is not. However, it is an entertaining piece of fluff with none of the merits of Nabokov's ""Lolita"". The prose is not at all believable as the words of a teenager and there was little of the girlishness of the ""real"" Lolita. Still, I have to admit, I read it in one sitting as one does with any mindless book. Pia Pera had a brilliant concept, but she blew it. The Foreward by Dmitri Nabokov is warning enough. So, if you can put your purist literary opinions aside, this is a fun read."
2,Implausible attempt at Lo's Perspective.,"I just finished this, and I hate to say that I am disappointed. From the language in the book, I found it hard to believe that Lo was just twelve years old. This story gave the impression that the author had forgotten what it was like to be a child. Instead of writing in the mind of a child, I get the impression that the author read a ""How To"" on being a child and drafted her work based on that. I realize that Lo was sophisticated for her age, but some of her vocabulary was just too advanced for a twelve year old. Further, the style of writing was so tedious to read that I found myself wanting to skip through paragraphs."
1,One star is one too many stars,"This book was a waste of my money and is not worth my time to review.If you buy it, you'll regret it. Trust me."
2,"Controversial, yes; praiseworthy, no.","I find it exceedingly pompous of Pia Pera to fancy herself a master of prose comparable to Nabokov. Reading ""Lolita"" itself alongside ""Lo's Diary"" shows that Pera, for the most part, fails miserably in her attempt to shed new insight into the character of Dolores Maze (aka Haze.) In addition, the aforementioned maturity of voice lends incredulity to the book, as no authentic twelve-year-old, no matter how precocious, could write a diary with language like that. All in all the book was a letdown, though it does get deliciously catty at times. Its beginning chapters shone above its dreary middle and ultimately dull denouement."
3,"Entertaining on one level, but mostly drek.","It's revoltingly unfaithful to Nabokov's original text.The ""real"" names and so forth- Goatscreek, Dolores Maze, Gerry Sue Filthy- are hokey and rather unbelievable. The protagonist's diary, allegedly begun when she was about ten or eleven, is so far beyond precocious that it loses all its credibility.Pera has decided, perhaps wisely, to keep it so deeply in Lo's focus that the entire affair with Humbert seems inconsequential; a nothing. I found myself squirming and skipping through the many esoteric bits of American pre-teen lore, instead looking for some scraps of story.Oh, right- it has no ending. There is no conclusion, no closure. Even in a diary format, some kind of ending could have been scrounged up.Alone, ""Lo's Diary"" might have been a very interesting and peculiar text. However, the only purpose it currently serves is to pervert the excellent original writings."
1,Couldn't Even Begin,"I stopped at the back jacket. Today, I was at the local monstrosity of book store, and was caught by the title. The concept seemed interesting, I supposed, but in the end I tend to believe that it's being is rather fundementally -wrong-. One of the more interesting aspects of Nabokov's original masterpeice is Humbert's delusions, Lo's inaccessability, the secrets and sorrow of the situation they'd both brought themselves into. I found the very honey drips of her personality that leaked through only once or twice in Nabokov's work added so much to the tragedy of the book. This sense of quiet tragedy, the secret life of a little girl and a man with a sick mind wasm I gather, unfortunately twisted for the sake of feminist retrospect. I found what quotes I could pull from 'Lo's Diary' were dull or written in a fashion that smacked of a short feature from the glossy pages of Cosmo. 'Lolita' was a shining example of literary brilliance, and this book never needed to happen."
2,Awful,"After breezing through Lolita, I was dying to hear Lolita's side of the story and picked up Lo's Diary. Needless to say, I shouldn't have bothered. It's slow moving, wordy and quite unexceptional."
4,"Very generic, but it's okay.","This album lacks hard in what their first two did, a unique sound. It makes me sad that this band is begining to fade out it seems, but atleast I'll always have Last Night in Town and Burial Plot Bidding.Secondly, to the other person to review this album, who cares what you think? No one ever said this album was targeted to an audience, I honestly don't think music, or good music for that matter, should be ""targeted"" to certain people. It should just be the artist(s) expressing themselves and if you as an individual like it, listen to it. Also trying to keep your children away from the concepts, that you previously listed, by not letting them listen to an album is foolish. Sit down and talk to them. There are a thousand worse ways your kids could encounter these concepts compared to listening to a cd that discusses them."
4,Measurements were confusing,"Fit in my BBQ, but its too small. They should write out the exact measurements, not a range, so you know the size of the unit. Otherwise its works as it should."
4,Grill Care TH204-0238 Universal-Fit Dual-Venturi Stainless-Steel Bar Burner,"This burner is great...better than OEM. Great value. Would buy again. This is at least the 3rd burner (probably 4th) on my old Char Broil unit. It is about 2"" longer (1"" either side of centerline) than one I replaced (many years old - really bad shape). So I'll get more heat and more useable grill area. Easy to install. Rated it a 4 ONLY because I wish it was made of high nickel stainless (so it would last longer) AND wish they'd include a WING nut for the stud that attaches on the bottom of the burner for fixing to the grill. Not a big deal on the wing nut, just would make it easier to install and I can get wnut (later) from the local hardware store. Time to grill some chicken!One other thing: if you're going to buy a grill, get one with a CAST housing, not ""stamped"" stainless or carbon steel. Cast housings last SO much longer, don't hardly corrode, and stay the same color from new to aged (black!)."
2,Gas Grill Burner - Truthful Review,"The replacement burner, although very affordable, was a real challenge to install, I have done this several times with our grill, but the eight screws that must be screwed directly into the burner do not have the right size holes in the burner and are next to impossible to thread in with out a perfectly sized phillips head screwdriver and a LOT of pressere to force the screws to thread in. The only attachment for the flexible gas pipes (VENTURI's) to the grill itself is with two little springs, obviously made for some other purpose, so no adjustment is possible to acheive a true blue flame. Finally, with reddened hands from the screw driver and twisting the tiny springs on to an available screw, the unit lights fine, but with a largish yellow flame, which is O.K. - but not optimum. I will not purchase this Grill Care brand next time we need a replacement burner for our gas grill, although it is functioning at about 70%."
4,gas burner,"The product was just as advertised. The shipping charge was high. The price was low. Over all it was a good deal, with very fast shipping."
1,NOT A GOOD PRODUCT FOR OUR GRILL,"COULD NOT USE--MEASUREMENTS BEFORE HAND SOUNDED CORRECT W/MEASUREMENTS GIVEN ON PRODUCT STATS.WE KNEW WE HAD OLD GRILL AND RESEARCHING YOUR PRODUCT SEEMED LIKE RIGHT PRODUCT.HUSBAND PUT TOGETHER,LIT BURNERS,BUT HE WAS DISAPPOINTED IN QUALITY IN GENERAL.WE DID NOT SEND BACK, AS HE FELT WE HAD TRIED TO USE AND DIDN'T THINK OUR MONEY WOULD BE REFUNDED.THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE HAD A PROBLEM."
4,Grill Care drop in replacement for Char-Broil Gass BBQ,"This product drops in to the existing space on a Charbroil BBQ.Twin flexible hoses connect to the original gas outlet pipes.Some tuning is required to get enough air into the pipes with gas so the BBQ burns blue rather than smoky yellow.We found that the pipes had to be connected at the very end of the existing connector to work best with the venturi valves open to their fullest.It worked a treat saving us the cost of a new BBQ, so very pleased with it.Especially as we couldn't get a replacement part in the UK, and all the US companies wouldn't ship so Amazon.com to the rescue."
1,Look elsewhere.,"I understand that this needs to be very flexible to be able to fit most applications, but assembly is quite difficult (and I am a maintenance man by trade), and many attachments are in my opinion are less than safe (venturies are held in place on the gas valves with flimsy springs). Screw holes are too small for screws provided; venturies are flimsy foil. Also, there is not an adequate way to adjust the venturies to get a decent blue flame. I've wasted my money."
1,Really and awful recording.,I really like Strauss II and was hopeful about what would be on the collection. I should have listened to more of the samples before purchasing. It sounds like it was recorded with a child's Fisher Price play set. Truly I have never heard a worse recording - when I could actually hear it. Much of the recording drops below audio range.
3,"Definitly NOT a ""how to"" book","39 pages of this 113 page book is a copy of the poem or scripture PSALMS 1 - 150 from the Christian Bible. There are 4 pages giving a slight overview of the world history of using beads in prayer. After that, a few more prayers preceded with the instructions, ""Inhale with a double breath breathing in light, exhale with a double breath breathing out darkness"". There were some nice illustrations and couple of Christian focused chants. Don't buy this book if you are looking for real history or how-to-pray-with-beads information. It's basically a book of prayers."
1,I couldn't tell any difference...,"But I have heard rave reviews from so many others! If you have well water that is turning your hair STRANGE colors (mine was going from blonde to a bright red/rust color) and drying out, then I would suggest trying this...I was willing to try just about anything and unfortunately, this didn't do too much for me, but I've heard that it's work for others, so guess it's just the luck of the draw."
2,It's fine product,"This product is too prizy compare to it's price + shipping fee. I don't like it smell that reminded me kids liquid medicines. It made me headache. Also, I had to use it handfull to clean my long hair and have to clean at least 2 times, sometimes 3 times to shampoo my hair. You can finish this bottle easy in just a month!!"
5,Just what I needed,"The water at my house was leaving deposits in my hair, turning it a orange color in places. So, my stylist recommended that I get this product to try to get it out. This product is perfect. It recommends getting the professional malibu treatment at the salon first, and then using this product to keep the deposits out. I used the shampoo without getting the professional treatment, and it really lightened the orange color from a deep orange to a very pale orange. I am hopeful that the continued use will completely get the color out, but if not, I will go to the salon to get the professional treatment. I would definitely recommend this product if you have this same problem if you are a blonde. For people with color-treated hair, I would say to avoid this product because I used to dye my hair brown and used the product and it started stripping the color."
5,Only thing that works,I have baby fine highlighted blonde hair and well water. This is by far the only shampoo that works for me! At times when my filter needs changed or salt in the softner this shampoo feels like it may not work...I learned to mix it with distilled water to thin it out and it really works plus my bottle lasts longer. Love it!!!!
5,Great shampoo,I have unfilter well water & my hair as never been right until I used this shampoo. Now my hair is soft & feels clean!
5,A must for curly hair and well water!,I have naturally curly hair and have had problems with well water turning my hair to frizz and hardly any curl. This shampoo allows me to wear my hair curly again. It is well worth the money.
4,Awesome,My hair was such a wreck - we have a well. My hair dresser kept cutting the damaged ends and my hair got shorter and shoter (not what I want.) This truly saved my hair. When I went for my last cut my stylist couldn't believe the change. I miss the lather of my old stuff but my hair thanks me.
2,No difference,"Bought this product because I have well water and my hair was going to the dogs. I know it sometimes depends on what kind of well water you have (each can have different minerals and different levels of excess), so it might be more prudent to spend the money on a water test instead. But this product did nothing for me and I am looking to give it away.What ended up working for me is using simple baking soda to clean hair once a week followed by an apple cider vinegar rinse (sometimes with a teaspoon of honey added). Much cheaper!I do like the Malibu Packet treatments though. Use those about once a month."
4,Pretty Good at removing yellow brassy look,"This product does work as long as you continuously use it. I wish they had conditioner, too, though."
4,Not as good as her first book,This book is not the same type of book nor was it as good as the first one but it was still readable.
4,Provocative and Informative,"I've been a fan of Dalrymple's writing for years, and looked forward to his latest book. It doesn't disappoint. Dalrymple demonstrates, both with examples from his practice and citations to medical literature, that withdrawal symptoms from opiates such as heroin are comparable to the flu, and are actually far less medically serious than the DTs experienced by alcoholics (which can actually be life-threatening). Our society is nevertheless far more sympathetic to heroin addicts than alcoholics, seeing them as tragic figures in need of medical treatment who have little if any responsibility for becoming addicted in the first place. Dalrymple traces the tendency to romanticize opiate addiction from the Romantic poets up through the recent ""heroin chic."" Required reading for anyone interested in addiction."
5,"One of the Best Books on the ""Treatment"" Industry","Finally, a book that university students in my course, Drugs and Society, can read that exposes the myths surrounding addiction and treatment. Beautifully written and compellingly argued, Dr. Dalrymple's newest book is his best yet. The engaging narrative has already captured students' attention and helped them begin to question what they had taken for granted about the value of the treatment industry. While the course supplements Romancing Opiates with additional readings on the ""other side,"" many students have found the arguments expressed in this book to make the most sense."
3,Dalrymple leaks his interest in alcohol.,"Dr. Dalrymple makes an important point about addiction, that it is a moral and spiritual, not a medical, problem.However, singling out opiate users was a bizarre mistake on his part. Í've worked with alcoholics and drug addicts. Contrary to what Dalrymple says, they both have the same character. They both are irritable when they aren't using and whiny and entitled, and deflect blame all over the place.The difference between the alcoholic and the drug addict is it's so easy to get alcohol that the alcoholic can APPEAR to be more civilized and ""mature"". Obviously. His substance is available everywhere in pretty bottles, legally.I have a feeling that there's a mysterious reason he demonized the drug addict and discussed the alcoholic as if he's just good old Uncle Al with rosy cheeks and a good story to tell."
4,Strong premise,"Dalrymple is an excellent writer and, for the first half of the book, draws open an astonishingly strong premise regarding the popular fictions of addiction. While the second half wanders off into an area of no interest, this book is worth purchasing on the strength of the first half alone. Dalrymple is couragous and insightful and this book has been an eye-opener."
2,"Readable, but honest?","This book is well-written for the interested lay person, but is it trustworthy in the observations it offers or the points it makes? In the section when Russell addresses male dominance in primates and particularly in apes, he somehow fails to mention that females, not males, are dominant in bonobo social organization. This observation ought to have had a huge impact on the point he is making in this section -- actually, it would ruin the point he is making -- but he leaves it out completely. It is impossible that the author isn't aware of this aspect of bonobo social behavior. It makes me wonder: what else has Russell ignored, glossed over, or misrepresented in this book?"
3,Some sort of death frisbee?,"Why's it always the hat photograph? What kind of hat is it anyway? Is it a cap? Why's it got two fronts? How are you going to stalk deer with a hat? Are you going to throw it? Some kind of death frisbee? ...It's got flaps! Ear flaps! It's an ear hat, John!(But in all seriousness, this served its purpose as a gag gift for my friends who also watch the BBC's ""Sherlock,"" but nothing more. It's small, flimsy, and it slips. Still, it was good for a few laughs.)"
3,"Really, a review for a costume hat","If you are looking for a cheap Sherlock Holmes hat, this is fine. Cheap and does the job. Not something you would wear out in public anytime other than Halloween or if you are 7 years old and love Sherlock Holmes."
3,"small hat, great pipe","This is an ok set. I bought it for my 7 yr old son to use for halloween this year. The hat is WAY to small, it barely fits my 5 yr old daughter. The pipe is very cute though!"
1,Very flimsy and small,"We needed this for a detective costume. The hat was too small for my 8 year old. It was so flimsy and thin, it looked silly. It was only $3 so I didn't expect much."
2,OK hat,This hat was very thin but I was just using it as a tree topper for a Sherlock Holmes tree so it worked.
1,Not for a Person-shaped head,"Was disappointed with this hat, bought it for my amazing costume and not only did it not fit, it doesn't look like it could even fit a child's head properly. Flimsy and poorly made. I agree with another comment I saw, ""Death Frisby."" Not worth the price. Might work on an ugly scarecrow thing, maybe."
4,Great for a costume!,"For the price, we love this hat. It is a little snug on my husband who is about 5'10"" but it's not a big deal for a night. I did dye it brown because it looked a little too stark for my taste with the black and white houndstooth."
3,"Meh. It's okay, I guess.","I suppose that for the price I shouldn't expect any better than what I received. I'm not saying I didn't get what I ordered or anything, because that's exactly what I got: a cheap, costume hat.Again, for the price I halfway expected something like what I got. The material is thin, the stitching doesn't look like it will hold forever...it's great for a costume for one night, I guess."
1,Sherlock Holmes Cap #W39S23D,"The hat was not as substantial as it needed to be. It slipped and did not stay on well. It was somewhat thin and flimsy. From a distance, it served the purpose for use in a school play."
3,Cheap but what did you expect?,"Flimsy and cheap, as well as a little small. However, it worked out fine for a Halloween costume and I got what I paid for. If you're wearing this hat enough to be worried about long-term durability, you've got bigger problems than flimsy costumery."
4,Well done compilation,"I purchased this comp solely for the Brother To Brother selection, ""Chance With You"" and was pleasantly surprised to see it in its' full album-length version. Although the majority of tracks can be found on countless other comps, I was able to get this one for only about $7 (including S&H), so it was more than well worth it."
5,Great set of books,The most serious thought in one and the greatest of fiction in the other. A great combination to put together. These two books give us a glimse of the wide range of writing Lewis did in his lifetime.
3,He has better CD's,I Love Dan Zanes! The problem is his cd's are great and this one is just not as great.Catch That Train is a better choice for a get up and dance with your kids cd.
2,Only okay,"This CD is okay the first few times you listen to it, but it will grate on you by the 5th time. Some of the songs sound hillibilly and twangy, sing about topics that are not of special interest to kids, don't rhyme or are catchy, and don't teach anything."
5,Great music for all ages,"Dan Zanes rules! We have four of his CD's now, but this was our first. His music covers many genres, all upbeat, and is real ""move around"" music. My favorite on this CD is the Wabash Cannonball. My son loves House Party and my youngest daughter is a fan of the counting song; she has taught it to her entire pre-school class. If Dan's goal is to have everyone singing and dancing, then he has succeeded."
5,"""kids"" music for any & everyone!",We are huge fans of Dan Zanes in our house. Mostly because the kids love it & the grown-ups can stand to hear it over & over & over...unlike Barney or something of the like that makes you want to scream 2 minutes into it.I especially enjoy all the collaborations on this CD & his others...so many different types of music & sounds brought together. It teaches you about different cultures. And the folk/protest songs are a huge favorite as well. Listening to a Dan Zanes CD & reading the incredibly graphic & well written inserts that come along w/each CD are a treat that everyone w/kids should indulge in.Going on a family road-trip? Ditch the DVD player in the minivan & pop in a new Dan Zanes CD instead!!
1,Cracking the ACT:with sample test on cd rom,"This is the worst book i have ever bought. Some of the test tips helped but it was mostly just common sense that came with twenty bucks. Not only did the CD contain about a million errors, the practiced test were annoying especially on the english and reading sections because you have to scroll all the way down the screen for EACH question which takes up a chuck of your test time."
4,Neat gift: Mini Cherry Almond Biscotti,"My husband thoroughly enjoyed the cherry biscotti, a nice treat with coffee. I would purchase this item again."
5,"Wanted to wait for the trilogy, but couldn't...","I LOVE JESSICA ALBA! I really wanted to wait to get the collectors edition of the trilogy (when it comes out) but I couldn't wait. I broke down and got the 2-movie collection. Now I'll have to get the third as a loner.The first movie was a great intro to the series, and the second one was even better.A must for any SI-FI fans collection (if you can't wait)."
4,Two Movies - consistent characters,"I decided to get this 2-movie set version for the value and convenience. The original Fantastic Four movie disc offers the movie in Widescreen with a couple of featurettes. The Silver Surfer movie disc shows the movie in Full Screen format on side A and Widescreen on side B with commentary available. While I didn't expect all the bells and whistles on the second film that was offered in the other released editions, it would have been nice to have one featurette included.I enjoyed both movies as entertaining diversions. The special effects are quite good. The characters continue the first film's fun banter in the second film. However, don't expect great depth into the characters."
2,A Distinct Disappointment; Not Really a Spider Book At All!,"First off, this book's not even by Spider. I'm not vertain why he lent his name to it, much less wrote the introduction. The book itself is a loosely connected series of ramblings of a proto-typical dope-fiend from the 60's San Francisco scene. It's a bit trippy, and even mildly insightful once is a while, but was certainly not worth picking up if you're expecting anything like the quality of writing and storytelling that Spider Robinson imparts to all of _his_ works."
2,Not worth the price!!!,This is not worth the price. It feels extremely unstable after assembly. Very delicate item and not very handy.
4,adorable cradle,"This cradle is so adorable, it a bit larger than a new style bassinet but it is large enough so your newborn can get some longterm use out of it. I would recommend it to any one who like old style furniture."
4,Worth money,Works perfect but not sturdy to use for big babies and babies who start to roll over. So the use is limited to only 3 months.
4,Good Quality / Fast Shipping - thank you Amazon Mom!,"I bought this after reading many online reviews! The DaVinci Emily Mini Crib was a beautiful buy, so I did not doubt the DaVinci brand when choosing a cradle for our bedroom. Forget about the 'mattress pad' that it comes with it and just pay the price for a cradle mattress. Although my baby is not due for a few more weeks, I am anxious to see how long the cradle will hold him comfortably."
3,Low price equals low quality,"For what you pay for this furniture, you get a decent piece of wood that swings and casters that will roll. Other than that, not much pros about the product. The one support bar across the bottom is flimsy and the mattress is worthless. You are better off paying more money and buying a higer quality product."
3,Adequate,"This is a decent product, but it seems a tad overpriced for the actual quality. It's easy to assemble, that's a plus, but it's not exactly going to wow you with its sturdiness. While I understand that it's supposed to hold an infant, a little more rigidity would be nice. I don't like the way the legs seem to wobble a bit when you rock the cradle. The alignment seems a little bit off, too - the sleeping area and the legs are slightly skewed.You will want to replace the flimsy mattress that comes with it, too.It does seem adequately safe, and my child sleeps fine in it.Also, it's a nice look - a modern take on a classic idea, and that's well-accomplished with this design, so there are good points, too.If it were cheaper, I would rate this higher, because it's not bad, but for the flaws it has, it shouldn't cost as much as it does."
3,underwhelming,"This was easy to assemble, but once done, it's a little flimsier than most. A selling point of this bassinet is that it's portable but once you scoot it from one room to another more than a few times, the legs get a little wobbly.Also, the ""pin"" that is supposed to keep the cradle in place falls out too easily, and catches against the wood, which of course scratches it.Another time, the pin goes in, but the pin is so thin that the cradle moves about. So if baby rolls to the side, he will be on a slight incline, which may wake him up because the pin comes out so easily and is the wrong girth. Also, my son got his foot stuck through the slats."
3,"alright, not great.","The cradle arrived and was easy enough to assemble. The pad which comes with the crib is by no means adequate to support a baby. You will need to buy a cradle sized mattress. Also, the wheels do not stay within their sockets, and the cradle is difficult to roll around on the carpet. This is not a high quality product. I am going to try it out when baby arrives, but I would not purchase this item again, having seen it. I hope to be pleasantly surprised. The cradle is attractive."
5,This is the ultimate fantasy!,"I would recommend this to all fantasy readers! The characters and their abilities are genuine classics! If you like this book (I definately did), read the sequel! This thrilling adventure has a suprising ending... This is a fantastic novel!"
4,Of two minds,"Although I bought the book for my 12 year old niece to read for a school project I read it myself and I found it very absorbing and fun reading. As I come from a spiritual background where what Lenora was doing, materialising everything she was thinking It made me aware and I was happy to share with my niece the possibilities of the mind and spirit as well faith. I found the book refreshing and full of potential for discussion between parent and child."
4,"This book is outstanding , fun and very exciting.","A girl named Lenora has a vivid imagination.What ever she imagines comes true. A boy named Prince Coren has an ablity too. He can read peopleminds. I really enjoyed this book. It is a thinker you have to pay attention in order to know what it is about. I am not going to spoil the ending so it is a surprise when you read it.If anyone out there read it, you can post your review also. And thank-you for reading.Peace!"
5,One Mind + One Mind = Two Minds,"Lenora, a reckless princess that has the power to change whatever she imagines into reality. Coren, a timid prince that can speak with people mind to mind if they also have the power. They meet, and fall head-first into an adventure that is hilariously romantic, yet interesting. This is a great book for all ages, and I recommend it to all."
1,Bad characters,"This book had an okay premise and a semi-creative plot (basically the whole ""I didn't like the arranged marriage until I got to know him"", and also a bit of ""what kind of monster will I grow up to be?""). It could have been a good book, but the characters are just obnoxious. I was so annoyed at the princess', well, princessy attitude.The boy is just trying to help and she turns everything against him, when it's really her own fault. I don't know about you guys, but I can't sympathize with heroes who make me want to punch them."
4,Good,"I belive this book probably deserves 4.5 stars. I mean I thought it was really good, but not Outstanding. It is definitly worth the time and the money. Read It! The others are pretty good also. Check them out!"
1,Nope nope nope.,I really cant explain much of this book becuase I didnt even finish it. About halfway through i couldnt take it. I was confused and though it was very slow.
4,Beautiful for the right price,I bought this as a gift for my sister. It fits her nicely and looks amazing for the price I paid.
5,Rockwell Rocks!,"This is an oustanding recording that any belcanto lover should have on his collection.Like other guy said Rossini Tenors are now very present with Florez on the top of the list. But when Blake starts to sing at the end of the 70's there was nobody but he. His carreer was brilliant and by the end of 80's he was a really master of the voice. Ok his instrument it's not the most beauty but he can sing with a miracle technic, every coloratura was there, the ""martellato"" style, the spianato, and the fiato....what a fiato and you have to add the wonderful phrasing. He was one of those artist you have to see and hear live because he was even more electrifying on stage than in records.On The Rossini Tenor blake prove why he is the most important rossini performer of the last century and why he is still on the ear of every rossini fan. Hes a King between belcanto singers."
1,Neither pictorial nor history,"The information and pictures in this book are offered randomly and leave readers with a number of unanswered questions. The book is neither a coffee table pictorial nor a well-researched account on the nation's capital. Even though it presents some scattered information, nothing is systematic. When someone picks a book on the history of a certain city, she or he would like to learn about where the name of the city and its areas came from, what landmarks still stand today, what the stories behind them are and so on. Instead, this book pastes some random pictures and comments on them. At times, it does not even offer such commentary. I learnt a lot more about the history of Washington DC from Wikepedia than from this book. I certainly do not recommend it."
1,Old Model - Disappointed,"The swatter I received was an older model. The newer model, which I thought I was buying, has a protective guard over the unit that kills the bug. The 3 swatters I received did not have the guard, leaving the user open to injury if the burning unit is touched during operation."
3,"Scientific, Moving, Spiritual - (How about better and COLOR photographs??!!)","The book is very engaging - combining historical narative with the methodical process of scientific archeology and exploration.Several things would have made the book better and more comprehensive:1 - More exposition on the native American oral histories (details)2 - For crying out loud .. how about better, more and COLOR photographs of the site !! :-) (Esp. since it will still be years before public is granted access)"
4,Not too shabby,This CD is one of my favorites. It really captures God's amazing love for us and the Christian spirit.
3,Excellent for young adults,Many of the songs are close to the hip-hop genre. Just a little too much funk for my taste. Lyrics are nice and geared more to the personal experience of worship than the out and out praise. Teens can identify with this album very well.
5,Great for embedded development,"Most embedded devices only have a serial port connection. However, almost all modern PCs have shed these devices from their motherboards. I have used these with Windows, Linux, and OS X to communicate with all kinds of embedded devices.On Windows, Tripp Lite provides a utility for remapping the COM ports, so that you do not have to use the default name assigned by Windows. There are many circumstances in which this is useful. The utility also provides the ability to maintain the COM port name assignment no matter which USB input is used. This feature alone justifies the purchase of the product."
2,Doesn't Work with Magellan GPS,"This adapter cord did not work with my Magellan SporTrak GPS. Magellan's own cord did not work either. This one did work with a glucose meter reader. It was twice as expensive as the two cords found that did work with the GPS unit. This one had its own configuration software and allowed for faster speeds, neither of which I need. I did return this cord for a full refund, including shipping, from Amazon."
5,Keyspan 19HS,"Prompt delivery. We have used several of the 19HS and each installation went flawless with the install CD for the drivers. Reasonably priced and it WORKS!Keyspan by Tripp Lite USA-19HS Hi-Speed USB Serial Adapter, PC, MAC, supports Cisco Break Sequence"
3,decent converter,"The keyspan converter is easy to install and generally works pretty well. Unlike a lot of converters, the keyspan keeps its com port number regardless of which USB port you plug it into. It has a utility to change the com port assignments if you want and a handy capture tool that displays all the traffic going over the serial port which is very useful for debugging code that uses the serial port.The only problem with it is I get fairly regular blue screen crashes on both Win XP and Win 7. The form factor could also be quite a bit smaller."
1,Does not work with iMac OS 10.6.7,"Does not work with Imac OS 10.6.7 Tripp-Lite states it may make the unit work but no updates are being worked on for the future. Instructed to visit their website to check for updates. By then iMac will have come up with newer updates, thus this product will never catch up to iMac. I wish I never bought it."
5,it sorta works on vista,The only problem is when you tell a program (like a map program when you hook up gps) to find it ....... it wont . You have to manually go thru the ports to find it. But then it functions flawlessly
5,USB Serial Adapter rEVIEW,This is the second adapter that I have purchased. Both continue to work as advertised.
5,It just works!,"Works perfectly with windows XP pro on my Asus a8js laptop (2ghz core2 duo, 2gb 667mhz ram, etc).I needed it because my new fancy laptop didn't have a serial port, and i use my laptop to connect my OBD2 scanner to automobiles to check the engine codes.This allows COM4 to be assigned to the usb port, and the OBDCOM software can use this usb adapter perfectly to communicate with the car. It also works perfectly with VAGCOM.it's worth the money, trust me.-gavin"
5,Works perfectly with iMac/Garmin,"I bought this to connect my iMac to Garmin eTrex. Works perfectly, no issues at all. I did download and install the latest driver from the Keyspan site, which was newer than the driver on the supplied CD."
5,Keyspan High Speed USB Serial Adapter ( USA-19HS ),"Great Price - easy to install! Would say ""Yes"" if asked by someone whether to use this product. Love Amazon.com!Keyspan High Speed USB Serial Adapter ( USA-19HS )"
5,J,"If you need to connect your laptop to a Cisco switch console port, any $8 serial to USB adapter will work.However, this serial to USB adapter fully supports the RS-232 spec and will work with any serial device. I found DSC alarm panels are particularly picky about serial connections. Tripp Lite's Keyspan USB connector is recommended by DSC. It works great.Another benefit is the relatively high cost of this adapter means the other techs probably will have $8 adapters. I can tell if they borrow mine now. I prefer different and better when I can get them. This USB to serial adapter qualifies in both categories."
2,Wasn't too good,"I had already bought one of these a long time ago and it worked well. I needed another and so I recently bought the same thing. The new one, however, quit operating reliabily after about a month. It works ok for about 20-30 minutes then just quits. In the work I do, that's not acceptible. My next purchase for a Rs232 to USB will be one that's less expensive."
1,Never worked. Ever.,Tried to use it to connect my OSX 10.6.8 Mac to a Garmin Vista. Never worked. Garmin software doesn't recognize the device. Tech support was nil. A complete waste.
5,linux works just fine,"Despite the first reviewers comments, the Keyspan 19HS works just fine with linux. The driver for the 19HS was included in the kernel source a while ago. Standard off-the-shelf kernels (2.4.24 and 2.6.5) work without any patches. In addition to regular usb support, my kernels also load the keyspan and usb-serial modules.After executing ""mknod /dev/ttyUSB0 c 188 0"", I am happily communicating with Palms and GPSs using the new /dev/ttyUSB0 device."
4,Simple but worked well,"I purchased this because our vendor mentioned that it would work with Windows 7, and voila, it did. Our previous devices were only compatible with Windows XP and would only work with Windows 7 with an off-normal market driver.We have multiple of these in service now and have had no issues."
2,Driver Delay for Mac Mountain Lion,Worked great connecting my Dell Windows XP laptop to Garmin GPS72. I then installed Mac drivers supplied on CD in adapter package into my Mac (MacBook Air). Mac did not show any USB ports for the USA-19HS. Contacted Tripp-Lite technical support. They said there was no USB driver support at this time ( 8/21/12) for OSX 10.8 released last month. Coming soon but they did not know when.
1,YOU MAY NEED TO BUY THREE OF THESE TO GET ONE THAT WORKS!!,I purchased this specific model to interface with an older model Roland plotter from an IMAC - it may well work but the one I received from Amazon was DEAD AS A DOORNAIL. No light - no recognition by the computer - no nothing. I tried writing a few inquiries to the manufacturer about it but have yet to hear back. I had to buy TWO more to get one that was operational. This is a VERY flakey product in my opinion. I think the older models work better from what I heard (look for the ones with the DIP switches which are passive devices and configurable by the user). NOT RECOMMENDED.
5,Worth the money,"I've had this adapter for a few years now. I've had no issues with OSX 10.5, 10.6, or Windows XP. It used it in a NetAcad course and found that it actually performs really well with Cisco equipment. I highly recommend this product if you are looking into a quality serial adapter."
5,great product,I works real good with the decal machine I got. Connected it from it to the computer.. No problems at all works like a dream.
5,Works Great!,"Tested with an HP laptop with both Windows XP and Fedora 8. Windows XP required the installation of additional drivers (which were on the included CDROM), but the stock Fedora release worked fine without additional drivers."
5,Great device,"This is a great device....easy to use, and very reliable. I also have one of these for my work laptop."
4,Works Fine,"Not a technical review, but I installed the software and it worked as it was supposed to. I am using WindowsXP Professional SP2 and Garmin and Nobeltec GPSes."
2,Linux users be warned,"This product is advertised as working under Linux, and technically it does. Its driver, however, relies on bits of closed-source firmware that are included in the kernel source. Debian-based distributions remove this firmware for philosophical reasons, so Keyspan devices won't work out of the box on these distributions. Rather, a custom kernel compilation (or something similar) is required to get it working."
4,Would be perfect if the USB cable would stay in,"Some coworkers and I have been using this adapter model for several years. It comes with good drivers, and unlike the cheap USB to serial adapters, the COM port you set this to use stays the same every time you plug it in so you don't have to keep digging in your system to identify the random com port that been assigned to your USB/serial adapter.The biggest gripe everyone has with this is that the included USB cable is not molded to the adapter, nor is there any sort of way other than some super strong adhesive to secure the cable to the adapter. So, if you're using a laptop or have it connected to any other type of equipment that can be moved, you run the risk of accidentally disconnecting it in the middle of whatever it is you're doing."
5,Worked as Described,Had absolutely no problems working with this product after install. Does everything it says it does. Very pleased. Would definitely recommend this product.
2,Win 7 64-bit FAIL,I have owned one of these for several years and it worked OK on my Win XP PC however after upgrading to Win 7 64-bit I experienced constant BSoD's. The product description indicates that it supports Win 7 (32-64bit) however their web site only has BETA Windows 7 drivers. I also do not recommend this product if you will be using Apple Boot Camp to run any Windows OS. I switched to IOGear USB to Serial device an have had zero issues.
5,Keyspan USB to Serial Adaptor,"I use this adaptor to control my Meade LX200 ACF and LXD55 telescopes with my Mac PowerBook Pro and astronomy software. It worked the first time I installed it with no problems. I use it with Equinox 6, Starry Night Pro, and AstroPlanner."
5,"Works great for Apple IIe to Mac file transfers. Virtual II, A2V2, ADT","This adapter works perfectly for Apple IIe to Mac transfers and vice-versa using the A2V2 and ADT software included in the Virtual II Apple II emulator. I was able to connect my old Apple IIe to my G4 PPC running OSX 10.4.11 using a Super Serial Card in the Apple IIe, a DB25 to DE9/R232 straight through cable from RetroFloppy.com, and this Keyspan DE9 to USB adapter. The A2V2 and ADT apps included with the Virtual II emulator I'm using worked on the very first try after following the instructions in the A2V2 help file. Don't go cheap on the DE9/R232 to USB adapter, this is the one that works. The drivers are excellent and make this the no problem solution if you are in the small community I'm in. (Also, DE9 = DB9 in case you were wondering about connector terminology). - I highly recommend this adapter."
5,Only One I Will Use,"I have used many USB to serial adapters for working on various control systems and data interfaces and this is the only one that I will use now. I have yet to find an application it does not work with, never had any problems."
1,NO LINUX SUPPORT,"Despite linux support being explicitly stated on the packaging, there is no official linux support for this device. I called TrippLite, and they told me that they no longer have these drivers anywhere, despite advertising linux support. They also seemed surprised when I told them that it was clearly on the box, and I had to send them a picture to prove it. If you want support for linux, DO NOT BUY THIS DEVICE.That being said, it worked just fine in Windows 7."
4,usb,haven't used it much but it seem pretty durable. its used on my laptop and the cord takes a beating but so far it looks pretty durable too.
1,Will cause BSOD if used heavily,"I've used numerous 19HS for casual stuff over the years without incident; However I recently hooked two weather stations to a system running win7 x64 and now I get a BSOD (IRQL not less than...) every few days. I have two 19HS connected, running the latest drivers and latest windows updates. Google for 19HS and BSOD; It appears to be known but unresolved issue (on xp, vista, win7). I'm now looking for a new solution that wont BSOD.."
1,Don't buy it,Don't bother buying it. My USA-19HS worked initially when installed but when I unplug it from the USB port and reconnect it all it does is loop back information sent to it. It will not receive data sent to the serial side. I reloaded the drivers and it worked but as soon as I unplugged it from the USB and plugged it back in it no longer worked.All the diagnostics say everything is fine. It just does not receive data and echos back anything sent to it. Called TRIPP tech support which was totally useless. Their tech support does nothing more than read a script. I explained that it echoed back anything sent to it even when not connected to another device. Their response; the device it is connected to may not be compatible! I just told them it was not connected to anything. So I connected it to another com port on the computer with the same results. Their response; the device it is connected to may not be compatible! ITS CONNECTED TO A STANDARD PC!!!
5,Fantastic Multi-Platform Support,"I have a few of these now and they are all fantastic! I have used them on both windows and mac OS (tiger,leopard,and snow leopard) for instrument control and they installed in a few minutes. I used python to write some control software and it easily connected to the provided drivers. The plastic case is a little cheap, but the hardware and software is of high quality."
2,Could be better,"Servicing serial through USB has never been a picnic. This device installed smoothly and then mapped itself to COM9. My Garmin GPS only deals with ports COM1 through COM4, and I'm not interested in trying to update its firmware to see if it will deal with higher ports. The Keyspan user manual offered a large, unwieldy process for forcing it to service other ports - but I didn't want to deal with collisions with other devices and software. So I put it on the shelf and got a Trendnet, which worked right out of the box."
4,It works!!,"As a Control Engineer in the Automation field, I finally bought a computer without a serial port.This little gadget hasn't failed me yet, using Windows 7 32bit.So far, it has worked on old G&L; crap, old and new AB drives and PLCs.I gave it all 4 instead of 5 because there is always room for improvement."
2,Did not communicate to my device under W7,I suppose the product is fine because it works on my older laptop with WXP. For some reason it fails to communicate properly with my device under W7.
1,Does NOT work with Linux even though it's advertised,"I got the USA-19HS thinking it would be good to support a company that releases it's products with linux drivers. Well, what a disappointment this was, even though there is a picture of Tux on the box along with the Windows and Mac icons this model is not supported in Linux. I emailed Keyspan support and got an auto-repsonder that said they'll get back to me within 72 hours. It's been 4 days and still no response from them. Luckily this thing worked pretty well in OS X so I sold it to a friend of mine and bought myself another USB serial adapter, a keyspan USA-19, which is an older model with good Linux support. Although I replaced this purchase with another one of Keyspan's products I wouldn't support this company in the future and won't recommend them to anyone else."
1,Dissappointed,Could not get this to work with my device. Tech Support was slow and ultimately gave up.
1,DO NOT BUY,"Tried customer support to resolve a hook up issue and did not return emails for five day, have almost given up."
5,Works for me,"I purchased this product so that I can access the console ports on network equipment to modify their settings. After loading the drivers to the adpater and plugging it in my Windows XP laptop, it created a virtual port to which I was able to point Hyper Terminal to use."
4,Works..,"Works well with my serial based digital camera, for which I use to take remote photos on my PC. This was important because the PCI-based Netbios serial card I tried using (and logically thought would work 100%) gave constant CRC errors. No such probs here. A little pricey product is my only complaint."
4,Check Software Drivers,Works fine with Win XP and has a driver for Vista. But tech support told me there has been no decision to write a driver for Windows 7. So I have had to get a serial port card for my new desktop.
5,Great Product,"I needed a serial adapter so I could console into routers and switches and this works perfectly, does exactly what I need it to."
4,BASIC stamp 2.0,It should be noted that this product is one of the only products that will allow one to program a Parallax BASIC stamp micro-processor from a Mac. So buy it if you have a BASIC stamp and a mac!:-)
2,Platters CD,"Quick delivery but wasn't satisfied with quality of music. It didn't sound like the original platters. But will keep it and play it,"
4,"Works great, needed hose fitting","This gauge works great, the green backlight even nearly matches my stock dash! I've run it up to ~23psi and it seems to read as accurately as any other boost gauge I've used. The only gripe I have is that the fittings required to hook it up are not included. I ordered an NPT to hose barb fitting from McMaster Carr (part number 44555K123, $2.50) which worked perfectly."
2,"Says ""new"", but, clearly not. A first for an Amazon purchase","I have shopped with Amazon for over a decade. Never have I received an item marked ""new"" when it is not. This is a ""used"", previously opened (no shrink wrap, no security label, looks like a used CD from someone's collection. Not what was expected. Would appreciate accurate description of items being sold in the future. This is not standard protocol for Amazon."
4,Easy Tornado,Ordered this item for a 5th grade school project. It worked as advertised and was very easy to connect. Would recommend this product if needing to make something like this.
1,Leaky,It leaked! The plastic is too soft. I ended up putting gorilla glue in each end to seal it. One time use only...
3,Tornado Tube,"Good product, my grandson loved it but it does leak badly, I had to find washers that would fit the tube in order to stop the leaking, I did and it works fine now. Also, the shipping was extremely slow."
3,A nice little knife,"Nice little knife. Still seems long for skinning wire (at least for me).A 1"" hook blade would, in my eyes, work better.Nice to have in my pocket though"
5,Great Child book,The book tells a wonderful tale. The use of very few Finnish words allows even children with no tie to Finland to remember at least 1 or 2 finnish words. An annual book that we search for and read every March around the 16th.
4,Interesting,"Five short Christian biographies providing interesting and profitable reading: George Muller, a man of faith and prayer who established orphanages in Bristol, England in the 19th century; Isobel Kuhn, a gifted Canadian who gave her life as a missionary to the Lisu people of China and Thailand, and died of cancer in 1957; Billy Bray, a unique 19th century Cornish evangelist who lived by faith and gave a cheerful and practical witness for the Gospel; David Brainerd, 18th century missionary to the North American Indians who endured great hardship and died at the age of 29; and Robert Annan of Dundee, Scotland, who came to love Christ and needy souls above all else and was an evangelist among the poor in 19th century Scotland. Reading the accounts of these five lives is an encouragement to learn more of these well-known and lesser-known servants of God."
5,God Made Them Great,"These books by John Tallach, God Made Them Great and They Shall Be Mine, are very excellent. I've greatly profited by reading it myself, and reading it to my children."
2,Waste of Time,You can learn almost everything in this book by getting on the court 5 times and you don't have to read. It did not bring my game to a higher level.
3,housing degrading over time,"I purchased this item new in 2004 (8 years ago). Used it a lot for a year, then parked it in my desk drawer for 7 years. Just recently got it out, put in a new battery, and starting to use it again.The unit works great, and generally I like it, and would give it 4 or 5 stars, except for one thing... after 7 years in my desk drawer (climate controlled house), the plastic is degrading. The entire unit has a sticky feel to it. (Note: other things in similar storage... old calculators, slide rules, a compass, staplers, etc. are all fine.)"
2,Not quite ready for prime time,"This is an amateurishly produced video which has good information, but falls short otherwise. The presenter appears uncomfortable in front of a camera, and sounds like he has a sinus infection. I bought this to accompany my lecture, but it didn't really add much. I don't know if the other videos in the Massage Nerd series are like this, but I would be wary of buying another one."
4,Excellent for the price!,"A pretty little piece, great for little girls especially! This is a fine piece for the price! Very small and fragile!"
3,Too long,"I did not realize these earrings would be so long. I will give them to my daughter in law for her birthday. She loves long earrings. The quality is good, This is a very good company. I have ordered several pieces from them and this is the only product I was not pleased with for myself because they are too long for me."
4,"Good, but bright","I love the features, and it's easy to use, plus the numbers are nice and big. However, even though there are 2 brightness settings, the low one isn't low enough! Still a good clock, but I have to cover it at night."
4,It is a vest for MEN,"I searched amazon for ""women's denim vest"" and the following vest was displayed. I didn't realize it is for a man. I ordered a medium, but it's way too large for me. It is of good quality. I ended up giving it to my husband and he likes it very much."
5,Awesome Unique Christmas Music - Pick this up ASAP,"Found this CD years ago at a Best Buy and it has become a staple around Christmas Time at our house. The reggae spin is done really well and isn't over the top at all. If your Christmas music seems a bit stale at times, this is a sure-fire way to kick the holiday spirit into gear. Pick this CD up, well worth it."
4,I need more information,"Love stuff about Serial Killers. Just got my DVD in the mail. I have only one problem, though. While the titles of each episode are given, no other info pertaining to the case is summed up. I would like to know WHO the serial killer is, and maybe a brief bio about them before I decided which episode I'd like to watch. Call me a control freak, but I like to be prepared rather than suprised when I sit down to watch something. Maybe this is a minor flaw, but all the same, a little more info on each episide would have been nice."
3,This is just a question,"Hi, sorry this is not a review. I'd just like to know if these DVDs come with english subtitles.Thank you!"
4,"Great condition, for a great show!","I adore Forensic Files; the dvd in question came promptly and still in the packaging, the disks themselves absolutely untouched.Great seller, great condition, great show!"
5,"Uncanny X-Men, Volume 1","I love the X-Men. I always have and I always will. It's got the best characters of any comic I've ever read.This volume doesn't cover a lot of ground with the X-Men comics, which is completely understandable, but it covers enough to be enjoyable.It starts right off with Giant-Size X-Men Volume 1 which introduces a few new mutants: Storm, Wolverine, Sunfire, Thunderbird, Banshee, Colossus and Nightcrawler...the latter three being my favorites in the entire X-Men roster.I really enjoyed the illustrations and the writing of these comics, this era probably being my favorite era for the stories.I would recommend this to anyone who is an X-Men fan or a fan of 1970s Marvel."
5,WOW!,"This CD is positively a great album. At first I thought I was in a movie. The ambiance of the beginning starting with Dark Circus set the stage for for a visual and auditory experience that changes after 3 tracks into a dance sequence that produces a variety of rhythm forms starting with Agnosia, Trip Hop Thang and ends in a Miles Davis Jazz piece from another era and finally a surprise vocal in Dream a little Dream. Gratifyingly eclectic!"
4,Great Adult New Age/Electronica crossover,This is the first time I have been able to listen to a New Age/.Electronia album and liked everything. This album gave me a taste of what new music is and with a familiar flavor. If you want to know what direction new music is going get this CD! The CD will take you on a very enlightening journey you never expected.I recommend this for every age group!
3,Great bookshelf reference,"I had no previous exposure to Lotus Notes 4.6 or Domino and I needed a thorough introduction to both. This book definitely helped orientate me. The first half of the book seemed to target the Lotus Notes user, not the developer. As a result I found it overly detailed in some areas and seemingly vague in others. If you are looking for a comprehensive introduction to Lotus Notes from a development perspective, this book is a good, though not complete, reference. Besides, to date, I haven't found a better one."
3,"Good in parts, but not everything is covered","I bought this book because I had just started working for a company and been told to develop a notes application. I found the examples confusing, with some obvious features covered in depth and others barely covered. Now I know notes a little I do use it as an occasional reference, but I learnt more from pulling apart other peoples applications than I did from this book."
3,The worst album ever.,"I officially decided that this is the worst album ever, but for that, it must be heard! There is nothing amusing about it, as with some albums where it's so bad it's funny, or so bad, but reminiscent of something... nope. With this... we have just flat out, the worst thing ever recorded. There's no artistic, humorous or musical justification for any of it. And I kinda like Estep's writing.But, definitely give this a listen and tell me I'm not right."
1,"I wanna be, I wanna be, ani difranco.","Listen to fifteen seconds of any track from this CD. It's Ani DiFranco after her weight in amphetamines. And prozac. Maggie Estep is not good music, for lesbians or anyone else."
4,"Ambitious Product, but Capacity Too Low","The 2GB, 1GB versions of this MP3 player are much better. I recommend those if one is planning to store many songs on it. As for the 512, it can be used to store about the size of a single CD Album if needed."
2,could have been better...,"I was a little disappointed by this book. The first 75% of the book is all fluff. She doesn't get serious until chapter 9. If you are really serious about weight lifting, I would recommend Joyce Vedral. Her books are very helpful."
3,good idea but not easy to do follow the exercise,"Smart girls do dumbbells is a good book with great idea...but it is a waste of time flipping the book back and front to follow the 30 days schedule, plus reading a whole page to get the idea how to do one set of exercise right!!!!Because there is no index of which exercise is on which page, e.g. in the schedule it says ""today we will do S1, A3, A5, A21 and R5"", but then where can I find back the pages of those??I have to end up photocopy the schedule and stick lots and lots of (at least 30) bookmarks to help me find the right set of exercise!Great idea in the book, but with all these searching and flipping, I lost my interest!If a detachable page of the 30 days schedule can be included with a systematic index with be of great help. And either more photos when introducing the exercise or simply add a DVD will make this book prefect!"
4,excellent for a beginner!,"I'm a big fan of this book, and I think it's excellent for a beginner. I've used lots of machine weights, but I'd never really used free weights before. The book has given me lots of confidence in working with free weights and pushing my workout boundaries. I like the variety in exercises provided, and I appreciate the 30 day plan that lays out a month of workouts that alternate between upper and lower body. The author makes sure every workout balances the weight exercises so that you're working a complete set of muscles.The one downside to the book (and the reason for only four stars) is that the book does not have information for advancing further in the weight lifting. If you want to keep lifting dumbbells, it's fine, but I'd also like to move into bar weights. While I don't expect the book to cover these as well, I do wish the author had made some further recommendations for continued weight lifting."
1,Pointless stories,"I had high hopes for this book, especially after noticing that J. Stiglitz had a positive comment about it on the back cover. However, apart from being poorly written and jumping from one incoherent story to another, the book simply misses the point it tries to prove. As for the goal to explain international relations between the West and Asia, I did not even see an attempt. As for the goal to ""clarify"" the Asians mystique, I think the author added some fuel to the whole story and simply told where one can go to find plenty of cheap sex. I would classify this as a long tour guide to the sex industry in Asia coupled with several intertwined stories about women (arguably, of powerful women). However, neither part is good enough to warrant the read."
1,Feminist pap,"Written by someone who has lived a long time in Asia but has learned nothing and is still hung up on Western feminist stereotypes. Naive and presumptous, written by a grim middle-class Westerner unable to transcend her painfully obvious sophomoric limitations. Many words, no wisdom. The Chinese say ""ting bu dong"" meaning ""hear but not understand"" which is a good description of the author's perspective. Avoid and buy Ming Tan's How to Attract Asian Women instead -- a book written buy a sensitive and understanding Asian woman, filled with quotes from real Asian women, much better than this. Another great alternative is ""Foreign Babes in Beijing"" which was, like this book, written by an American woman who spent several years in Asia and starred in a Chinese soap opera. It is witty, intelligent, perceptive and gracefully written unlike this turkey. Avoid."
4,Accessible and thought provoking start to an important conversation,"This book is a very readable and dare I say entertaining introduction to important issues that most Westerners don't think about day-to-day. Great fodder for book groups that are interested in meaningful meaty discussions, but don't want to wade through heavy academic treatises."
5,"Brilliant, wise, and very readable",I've almost finished this book and I absolutely love it. Prasso combines great regional expertise with the unflinching eye of a trained anthropologist and seasoned journalist. There's nothing polemical about this book--just lots of wonderful reporting and cultural history that I honestly cannot put down. A wonderful read from an extremely talented writer--can't wait for her next book!
5,Women of color beware of the White man,"As a Black man, this book was enlightening; as long as White supremacy reigns, people-of-color will continue to suffer from the effects of White racism and White male supremacy. This should be a warning to all non-White females of the degeneracy of the White man. Don't fall into their trap!"
4,Heat Insulator,"does what it is supposed to do -- insulate carb from intake heat. Problem with material is is bonds with heat to the carb and the intake. So this makes it virtually impossible to remove and resuse as the material pulls apart. So, if you put it on make sure you do not plan on removing it later. Pretty expensive for a one shot usage."
1,Canned advice,"This books offers canned advice and can be summed up as:1. Find a good accountant2. Find a good lawyer3. Find a good business broker.The three people above are your 'team' and will carry you through the pitfalls of buying a business.Oh yes - he also spends one chapter on why lawyers are 'deal killers.'That's it - I saved you money. Three is no further detail, only a checklist. Nothing worth $19.You should only two Kiyosaki books: Cash Flow Quadrant and the Investing Guide - all else is nonsense and filler - regurgitating what he already said in previous. From his advisor series, the only person who fills the books with valuable information is Diane Kennedy's Loophols and Real Estate Loopholes. All other advisor books are filler and junk."
5,Great book for buying & selling a business,"This book will show you how to properly buy or sell a business. How to evaluate, negotiate and close the deal.I like the fact that Sutton includes scenarios and explanations.If you aspire to own your own business or looking to buy or sell a business, this is a great book to show you how.In addition you must read Own Your Own Corporation by Sutton and Rich Dad Success Stories for motivation and ideas."
1,38 minutes of boredom,"I like string music. I even like ""tribute""-Albums, but this CD really sucks. Every track is a sleeping pill on it's own."
5,Not one piece,"This looks like it is one piece in the picture, but it is actually 5 pieces. The 'X' piece, and 4 small 2"" pieces. Still works just fine."
1,If you're in college and clueless get it... otherwise...,"This book had no information that I could not have written myself and I know very little....This book may find a good home in a college career center. It gives information like, ""Find a good roommate"" - ??? Which means very little to those of us who are out of school, married and/or in the midst of our lives with no intention of finding a roommate. Not even sure how that relates to the career...."
1,Pure and total Cr@p,"Never again - not gonna buy ATT or use their service ever again. 1 out of 2-3 calls are dropped, service sucks when the call goes through, and cancelling was a nightmare.avoid them at all costs."
2,"Do not take my word for it, browse thru a copy yourself before you buy","While the topic is of great value, the structor of the book often gives readers a teaser to a subject and directs them to their website [..], (ie, for more details on how to do this goto our website) whilest it is a good business model. the irony is that as of today, none of their sites are up. which leaves the reader hanging and uninformed.so would the book be a good primer or intro to this loophole topic, and the answer is another astounding no, passages are laden with real estate jargons, especially in the Tax section that absolute beginners would find confusing, explanations are not well thoughtout.The book did achieve one goal and it is to confuse you enough that you would seek professional CPA and lawyer advice,which is generally a good rule of thumb. Other than that, the other richdad books are better written.But I believe there must be better books out there for this subject."
3,Real Estate Loopholes,"The book doesn't have alot of substance its more of an afirmation. However, it did get me interested in real estate and therefor I would recomend it to any beginner who would like to learn a little about it."
3,Incomplete and confusing,"This book was a quick read, but I found that I had more questions after reading the book than I did when I started. One of the primary thrusts of the book is to get asset protection through the use of corporate or limited partnership entities. Some of the techniques discussed in the book cannot be structured through a corporate entity without triggering adverse tax consequences. So what is a person to do? This book makes the most sense if you are -- or aspire to become -- a landlord. For more complicated situations -- or for varied approaches to working with real estate (such as flipping) -- I'm not sure what to do. I guess the bottom line is that you must get good advice from competent advisors who know your business. It's not a bad place to start, but the authors jump around alot, as not all ""loopholes"" apply to the traditional corporate structures that the authors push."
1,don't believe the hype,"Sadly, the tile ""Real Estate Loopholes"" is a misnomer -- this book is fluff and little more. Just count the ""stories"" which are basically filler (something to beef up two or three true ""loopholes,"" which, by the way, you'd be much better off reading about in the Ernst & Young tax guide 2003. Save your money...mtb"
1,Big mistake...,"I don't know what made me put these in my cart and buy them, but I did. I must have been feeling nostalgic for the early 90's when I was press on crazy. These nails must be made for people that prefer long toenails, because after I glued them on it looked like I have been growing them out for months. If you trim/file them, the white disappears so that's not an option. Aside from being way too long, they just look plain unnatural. You can see the space between nail and press on. I will stick to the nail salon, even if it does cost more. After removing them a few hours after application, my toe nails are so irritated and funny feeling I wanted to have a foot soak right away. Stay away from these nails, and all other press on's."
2,Nope not good,"This didn't work for me. After pregnancy I had trouble with ingrown nails on by big toes, so I got them permanently removed (so painful) but the nails still grew back. I really did not want to go through the procedure again so I thought I could glue these nails on (so that my nails don't dig into my skin an cause an infection like last time) and move my skin to the side for my nail to grow back properly. This did not work as I planned, I ended up going to the salon and getting acrylic on my two big toes, it coast about $10. Worked out perfectly!!!"
2,Some Bad Mistakes,"This book was a gift. I read the first section on Northwest georgia where I live. The Logue's description of the route from Chickamauga to The Pocket has serious problems. The account of the Union attack at Ship's Gap is confusing. They say that the Taylor's Ridge Trail is 0.4 mile from Ship's Gap when, in fact, the Trail is at Ship's Gap -- it is 0.4 mile from the Historic Marker about the Gap. They place Snake Creek Gap a few miles from Ship's Gap on the north side of Villanow. The Gap is actually several miles south of Villanow. Their explanation of why Federal troops were left ar Villanow (to prevent Johnson's retreat from Dalton) makes no sense. If the rest of the book is as filled with mistakes as this tour, travelers will come away from their drives with a very skewed view of history and geography. I like the tours that the Logue's offer, but I worry about their research."
2,For Beginners,"This book had some information that would be good for people thinking of getting a parakeet. But it does not give information about taming, breeding, or what to do if your bird is sick. If you buy this book, I would buy another one along with it."
4,A beautiful recording and fine introduction to his genius.,"Hariprasad Chaurasia is a serious classical musician of the very highest level. This beautifully recorded live concert version of his playing this raga is a marvelous introduction to those unaware of the beauty, extreme technical sophistication, mastery of detail but simplicity of this great musical genius. You will not regret it."
2,Brain Tricks : Coping With Your Defective Brain,I found this a very difficult book to keep motivated to keep reading. It is written more for the person that deals with various brain studies.
2,"Sounds good, but...","This book sounded great from the review and abstract, but it was a complete let down. I did not even finish it, therefore, you would be justified in nixing my review of it, but I did read most of it and it blew. It's not that I didn't agree with what it was saying, I just did not find anything new or refreshing in its content."
5,"Why do HMOs, providers, and bureaucrats behave so recklessly","Before you vote, learn more about health care issues. This book explains: What prompted HMOs? What are your rights? Bureaucrat's incentives Provider's incentives Employer's incentives Hospital's incentives HMO's incentives Alternate Solutions"
1,BlackHEAD Flashlight,"I bought one of these 'so called' blackout flashlights in Aug '07. In six months it died on the charge cord. I guess Amazon made them replace it for me. That was nice of them. But by Aug '08 is was DEAD as a door knob again! If you have money to THROW AWAY, buy one of these 'EMERGENCY' flashlights. Seriously, these should be taken off the market and it is sad that Amazon continues to allow them to sell them on their web site."
1,Viatec NOAA Blackout flashlight,this flashlight is a flimsy posI expected a decent product for this too expensive unitit's ok if you want a toy flashlight for your kidsusless as a true & hardy piece of survival euipment
5,Pan,"I love this muffin pan it's of very good quality not flimsy bakes corn muffins,muffins & cupcakes with easy cleanupI'm so glad I purchased with amazon."
1,Received with free RUST,I ordered three tins pans and the tin cookbook. 2 of the three were perfect however the traditional cupcake tin had rust spots/defects on the cooking side and underside of the tin.Not very pleased
2,"Rust, rust, rust",Who cares if it is non-stick if I can't use it because of all the rust. I will try the Wilton.
2,Great pan if you like the taste of Teflon,"This muffin pan worked great until the last time I made muffins. I'm not sure what happened, but regardless of using non stick cooking spray in addition to the non stick coating on the pan, the muffins stuck to the pan and on each and every muffin there was a grey coat of shiny teflon (or whatever the non-stick coating is) all the way around the muffin! These pans were only a year or two old. In all fairness to Baker's Secret, maybe it would have happened with any Teflon coated muffin pan, but I know one thing's for sure...I will not be buying Baker's Secret pans again!"
5,Amateur Baker,The muffin pan is excellent for making store-bought cake mix cupcakes. Just remember to line the pan with cupcake holders.
4,Baker Secret 12 cup Muffin Pan,"My wife have been wanting an additional larger muffin pan. Although she hasn't used it yet, she says it was what she wanted."
1,Cheap & Toxic!,We bought this muffin pan 6 months ago and today our muffins came out with metal flakes all over them! This pan is so cheap and unsafe! The non-stick coating will flake off in a short time frame and you will be disappointed. The flaking coating is probably a cheap Teflon which is highly toxic to the body! My mother-in-laws birds just died from heating a skillet too high which gave off toxic Teflon fumes (this was confirmed by the vet). Can't imagine what the Bakers Secret coating will do inside me for the next 30 years. Pay a little more and get something of quality. Lesson learned for me with this cheap crap.
2,It does tick,"I wouldn't recommend this pan. It says its nonstick, not true. I oiled it & still my muffins had to be pried out. I could NEVER use without greasing it first. Also the price was way too high when I compared at the store."
1,Wrong item,Ordered 6 Baker's Secret muffins pan but got only 4 of it plus 2 pans of brand Baker's Select! I should have been advised that seller replaced the 2 pans to another brand.Sad thing is how can I change them when I live in Asia!
4,An excellent choice to use as a study guide.,"This book had more than enough illustrations. Detailed and simple enough to understand. I've been working with Notes for 2.5 years and it taught me a thing here and there. It helped me create a Notes Mail workshop for my clients. It helped me explain and describe options easier, so that my clients could understand what tools were available, and where to go to use them."
3,"Good source for general info, but not very thorough.",This book is fine for someone who needs just basic information on Lotus Notes. The book is small and therefore easy to transport. My only regret is the general nature of the information.
2,Vague and not real helpful!,"Poor use of print screens, very often screens do not show what the descriptions say. Features of Lotus notes was very vague. I wanted to know the why and howcomes and you just don't get it in this book. I am now looking at other options."
5,The Reasons Why We Do What We Do,"The Study of Liturgy provides an easily readible and comprehensive history of the development of Liturgy. This study shows how such things as seasonal colors, vestments,Church calenders,and specific prayers came to be part of liturgical worship. What makes this book so useful is it's quality writing. Here, both students of Liturgy and interested laypersons can find facenating answers to their questions concerning liturgical function and ritual. How does the wearing of vestments impact worship? Why do the participants do what they do and when? What is Lent? What's up with all the bowing and hand gestures? Liturgical worship can be an awesome and majestic expierence. This wonderful book will demystify this type of worship for liturgical church goers and those of more reformed traditions alike.The authors have produced a quality work that can be read by non-technical persons and thoroughly enjoyed."
3,Not for Everyone,"This book is aimed at a very high and lofty scholarly class. It is, at times, inaccessible to casual reading and learning. If one was interested in a first step study of liturgy, they might want to look elsewhere."
3,UTI back :(,"I was so hoping it will work for my Cavalier King Charles. This was suggested by a specialist to add to the antibiotics. My dog has had resistant UTI for 2 yrs now. Along with the UTI meds, she's also taking heart meds that's why the vets think the UTI meds are being diluted with the heart meds. They suggested D-Mannose. I'm still not giving up. I believe at some point the D-Mannose will kick in!"
2,worked but hardly any in the bottle.,I purchased this not even 2 weeks ago and I'm already out of it! I used one teaspoon per day and it didn't last long at all. It did work as stated but when I opened the bottle there wasn't even a fourth of the bottle full. Even though this worked I will be shopping around to find one with a good price and better supply. Disappointed.
4,My Urologist's nurse recommended it.,"I went to my health food store to get some of this and the clerk said her mom used it, but got it from Amazon. It was cheeper and worked just as well. It has helped me not to get the ecoli bladder infection."
5,T4 Para,"Reviewed this product previously and I am still using it and have gone over three months without a UTI, where I was having one a month before."
5,D-Mannose for pets,"Guess what .......... It works great for cats, dogs, and horses. My Miniature Schnauzer had bladder stones. After surgery, I was told, it is common for them to come back. The D-Mannose powder in her food, every feeding, keeps her bladder clear."
5,It works,"I was desperate to avoid antibiotics after 2 days of chugging cranberry juice. This works. I recommend continuing for a few days after symptoms subside and avoid triggers (wine, soda, etc)."
4,"The product is fine, the delivery system not ideal","The product does not work quite as I expected it to. We had a heat wave and the day it arrived, the temperature was hot and the USPS truck was hotter...and we don't get our mail till 4pm. There is no gel pack included in the mailer to compensate for the heat. Tis is something for Amazn to consider.We have used D-Mannose before and found it very helpful."
5,Great for prevention!,"I chronically get UTI's. I noticed that they are directly related to dehydration and sex. I would 100% of the time get one when I had to take a few of the migraine pills (Tylenol, aspirin, and caffeine) or if I had too much coffee or alcohol too many days in a row. Anyway, my Dr. told me to try D-Mannose as a preventative measure. It has been 7 months since my last UTI. I was previously getting UTI's anywhere from every few days at its worst to 1 every month at its best. This may not work for everyone, but as long as I take 1 pill a day, I have not had a UTI. I recommend at the very least to give this product a try. If it doesn't work, the worst that happens is you stay on antibiotics, but if it does work it can change your life!"
5,Great for UTIs,"I actually bought this for my wife who would get UTIs fairly regularly. It has helped, better than cranberry juice or pills. Great to simply add to some juice or yogurt, no bad taste. I highly recommend trying this if you get UTIs at all, what do you have to lose."
3,am i doing it wrong?,"so i ordered this in hopes to get rid of a UTI, (i tested negative on the at home test, but i do have some slight symptoms and tmi an odor at times). i started with 1 tsp a day, and there are some days i miss. The symptoms are still there so am I just not taking it enough? any advice would be great.other than that i do like the product, it seems to help but my dr told me all it does is mask the symptoms, is she right?updated: didn't work to get rid of UTI, so I took antibiotics.got rid of the uti not I will use this as a preventative measure."
4,D-mannose Help Please,"Can anyone help. I have bought some D-Mannose, I tend to get a UTI everytime I have sex so I thought I would try this. Does anyone know if this works? Is the powder more effective? and do you have to take it before sex or can it be after?"
3,Helped with uti symptoms only,I gave this product 3 stars because it did help to relieve the symptoms of the UTI I had but it did not do anything to help clear it up. I would use it again if I was unable to get to the doctor's office for a day or two but it definately will not help to clear up a full blown UTI.
5,Shocked!,"I am in shock. I feel like a whole new person just after one day of this. Great for urinary health. I really have no other words besides awesome. I'm all about promoting health with supplements and natural substances.. and this is great. I'm not sure if anyone has made a comment about the taste, but I think the powder actually makes my water taste better.. I recommend to anyone who has frequent UTIs. Some people are blessed to never experience them, while others battle with them despite great hygeine and self care. I bought it--not having a UTI--but for a daily thing. I've read where D-mannose is great at preventing the problem before it starts!"
5,Saved me from extensive use of antibiotics,"D-Mannose along with Cranberry capsules and a daily pro-biotic has prevented the recurring urinary tract infections I have endured ever since I picked up a nasty bacteria in hospital during a surgical procedure. Three times I was given a 90-day 1X a day antibiotic in an attempt to prevent these from recurring, as prescribed by a gynocological urologist. When I said I would not risk more antibiotics at my age in fear of them becoming ineffective, the doctor finally recommended this regimen. I have not had recurring UT infections since using D-Mannose daily. If you suffer from frequent urinary tract infections, I suggest you try this compound. It works for me."
2,It did not work for me.,"I wanted this product to work! I took it exactly as suggested, but I still got a new infection within days."
1,Hopes Dashed...,"I get a UTI at least every 5 to 6 weeks and was hoping that the rave reviews I read would become a reality for me. I followed the instructions and took a tsp. daily....sometimes twice a day, to no avail."
2,Not helpful At All,It did help me at all! I took 6 capsules a day for over 3 months and I still got a bladder infection. Wish I could say that it helped me with my problem!
3,D-mannose 500mg-120 caps,"I started taking D-Mannose about two weeks ago, I have not noticed a difference yet, but hope to see a change soon!"
5,A natural miracle - it works!,"I won't repeat the explanations about how D-Mannose works, but believe me, IT DOES WORK. My story - after countless urinary tract infections in my life, I went to a new doctor with my latest UTI. He gave me Septra and then told me order some D-Mannose. He said that I could prevent UTIs myself with this natural powder with no side effects. I took the Septra but still had lingering discomfort. My D-Mannose powder arrived from Amazon and after taking a teaspoon in water every hour, in 2 hours all discomfort was gone - and stayed gone. My sister has had the same experience with it and we are SOLD COMPLETELY in the power of D-Mannose. On Amazon it is under $15, but the very same bottle by NOW is over $30 at health food stores. Do yourself a favor and stock up on D-Mannose to be FREE of UTIs forever. Rarely does a simple product deliver what it promises - rest assured, this one does!"
4,Great product!,"After much research on this product and the good reviews, I decided to go with this company NOW.I purchased this for my wife since she doesn't like to take tablets and she found the taste and effectiveness works very good so far. I've since reordered with a subscribe and save (additional 5% off). Hope this helps. Reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it's only been a week since she took it so I'd have to give an update soon."
5,Chronic UTI's,I bought this because I have had chronic UTI's since I got married. This was the only nonprescription thing that would would work at preventing my UTI's from starting and it would help clear them up if I took them upon first symptoms. I am so grateful for this product because it has helped me physically and emotionally because I don't have to stress and fret about whether I am getting a UTI or not.
5,Amazing cure for UTI right at Amazon!!!,After suffering for several years with UTI infections this natural medicine has worked a miracle. It prevents bacteria from attaching to the bladder wall. I would not have believed it if I had not tried it!!
3,Underwhelmed,"The jar is 2/3 empty when received (well beyond what one could consider normal settling) and an average dinner spoon won't fit the opening. Unless you have a thin long handled teaspoon handy, scooping this powder out will be difficult. I also found that the powder seemed to have some sediment in it. Since D-Mannose should fully dissolve pretty easily, I was left wondering if those stubborn clumpy bits were some kind of filler. I also didn't experience the miracle cures some other reviewers have experienced, but I do think it helped somewhat. I will definitely try D-Mannose again, but I'll look for another brand."
5,Great for urinary health!,"Frequent UTIs and possible Interstitial Cystitis = unhappy person!!! I take this everyday and my symptoms are almost completely gone and I rarely get UTIs anymore. If I start to feel one coming on, I take 2-3 of these a day and it goes away."
1,Doesn't Work,I was advised by my doctor to try this product to prevent recurring urinary tract infections. It did not work at all and made me sick besides. A waste of money.
2,Hid the symptoms for a day,"I'm sure that many people have had success with this product, but I just wasen't one of them. Perhaps if you caught an infection early and tried it, but mine had gone on about a week before I was SURE it was a UTI. The day I received my bottle in the mail I ripped open the package and began my doses. I took 1 heaping teaspoon every 2-3 hours, and for that day I did start to feel better. But the next morning when I woke up my symptoms were raging! So basically it hid the symptoms the previous day, but did nothing to help the infection. I'm now I antibiotics which I was trying to avoid. Wish I would have saved the money on this. Maybe it works for some, but not for all.Update: I didn't have a uti in fact. The doctors were not sure what I had actually and it just went away on it's own. I don't want to sway others with my review if in fact I had no bacteria in my bladder. For the price just try it for yourself and see if it works. So many people love it, it must work great!"
5,Awesome for UTI prevention,"I was getting a urinary tract infection every two months for over a year. Excessive antibiotic use also caused yeast infections and compromised immune system. I seen a specialist and had a cystoscopy and he could not find any issues that were causing the UTI's. He recommended that I take a low dose of antibiotics before intimacy and when I started menstration. I did not want to take the risk of over use of antibiotics with the risk of MRSA (becoming resistant to antibiotics). Someone recommended that i see a naturopath. He recommended D-mannose. I started taking one pill a day. I was very skeptical. However, it has been over two years and I have not had a UTI since I started taking these. When I feel symptoms of a UTI coming, I take a few extra pills a day and that seems to relieve the symptoms."
5,One of the best sources.,"The is the best price I have found for the product. I have used it for some time and it works if taken in proper dosages (two tablets every three hours for several days if you have a urinary track infection). I have been taking this in conjuction withRoyal Break-Stone, Kidney-Bladder Support, 400 mg, 120 Veggie Capswhich deals with kidney stones. The combination seems to work for me. The products are low priced and worth trying. Herbal medication is a cheap preventative and can lower your medical bills."
5,For chronic uti,I have been putting a scoop of D mannose in my coffee every morning. Antiboiotics don't work for me. The infection just comes back within days. This stuff keeps me comfortable.
3,It's okay,So I've been getting UTI's like crazy and this I'm not sure about if it works or not. Like I didn't even see a difference but it might work for others anyways I had to go back to my doctor to get bacterium and that stuff cleared it up within a day. You can get a UTI from not eating a lot of greens and if your under stress I knew knew that and always wipe front to back! Another tip is to START eating HEALTHY to avoid these nasty UTI's. I did notice yogurt has helped me a lot and something called UTI gone in the vitamin shop and Alfalfa works great too. I don't really like this sugar water stuff but anyways ladies and gentleman's that's my opinion.
3,Can help cats/dogs with issues,"IMPORTANT TIP: I discovered that my cats were not getting near enough water and have spent thousands at the vet. I figured out on my own, to give my cats orally by a syringe between 5-10 ml (most pharmacy will give you these for free, just ask) twice a day. Just be careful as not to force it or could get into lungs. After a few weeks, cats are used to this and almost seem to like it. I use only reverse osmosis water with added minerals (trace amount). Your vet wont like this because it means you wont be bringing your cats in for urinary problems or blockages any more."
2,Caused acid reflux...,"Can't take cranberry, because of acid reflux...this product also triggered acid reflux -- ARGH! Was hoping this would be the miracle cure, but would rather deal with infections than acid reflux. If you don't suffer from ARD, then this product is probably a godsend for you!"
4,It works. . . .,"UTI's effect elderly differently than younger people. I have learned this 1st hand taking care of two elderly disabled parents. So I'd already read about D-mannose & gotten a bottle, when I had to go to the hospital for bad spams in my lower right back. They diagnosed me with kidney stones & a long term kidney infection. The ER gave me pain meds & referred me to a specialist. My Doctor gave me three days of heavy duty antibiotics till I could make the appointment with the specialist. Simple antibiotics for ear infections can kill my digestive track for months afterward, despite asdphilious. So I was loth to use the more wide spectrum antibiotic. The article on the web stated if symptoms didn't improve w/in 24hrs to get antibiotics, so I tried this 1st. The symptoms did improve, so I kept taking it for the next 3dys to my appointment. The specialist found I had a slow draining kidney, but I tested clean for the infection the hospital said I'd had."
2,swanson brand is much better,"I first used swanson brand d mannose and when I opened the capsules and mixex with water, it healed my uti within 12 hours. Not so with this one. First of all, the big bottle is only halfway full. It disappears into the water, but swansons looks cloudy and it works. This one works too but u have to use tons of it for days..."
3,D-Mannose did not help me,"I purchased D-Mannose to help with recurring UTI's. I had read on the internet that this could help. Unfortunately it did not help me. But from what I have read, it has helped many people. At this price it is worth a try. (I found it at a herbal store for thirty bucks, I passed)"
2,Male user,"I am still hoping D-Mannose will work for me but I am losing faith. I seem to have a UT infection about every 3 months. I started taking the powder 6 months ago as maintenance, 1/day. After a month when I suspected an infection was starting I increased it to every 2-3 hours during waking hours. Still had the infection come on strong. Continued taking the D-M for 4 days, finally had to go to my Dr for an antibiotic. Now it is 3 months later and I suspect another infection is starting. Have increased intake of D-M, will update this review as things develop."
4,Serving size is suspect,"Dr. Oz only recommending 500 mg per day, while bottle has serving size of 1,500 mg. No UTI in short time used (had false positive on initial tests; culture came back negative)."
3,WITTY AND CUTE. AMEN,"Holy hosannas! Praise the word of the Lord ... and have a few hearty chuckles at the same time. Mary and David Compton's teeny tome is a sequel to their first compendium of roadsign church signs cross America. In this pocket-sized pal, they have gathered more sources of unexpected wisdom; witty, thought-provoking marquee messages that inspire and amuse. Consider it a most ""soulful"" slice of Americana. There are close to 400 messages. Our top 3 faves: ""THOSE WHO THROW DIRT, LOSE GROUND;"" ""BODY PIERCING SAVED MY LIFE"" and ""LIFE IS MORE FUN IF YOU DON'T KEEP SCORE."" Our biggest problem is that the Comptons don't attribute the messages ... which makes us pray that these phrases were actually found in their travels --- and are not acts of sales-inspired sin."
2,"The show gets 1 star, bonus features *probably* earn 1 more","I loved the premise, but boy was the show a let down. A four comic team is a real drag when 3 of the 4 comedians aren't that funny. Even this could have been countered by giving Dane a bit more face time than the rest (and with material that most fans hadn't already heard many times)...but of course that didn't happen. The bus footage wasn't very insightful or interesting. Neither were the obligatory reality show excursions that they took.I haven't seen the DVD yet (it's still on pre-order). Hopefully the bonus footage captures some of what the show itself missed. If not, count this as a 1 star review."
2,B-O-R-I-N-G!!,"Got this DVD set as a delayed Xmas present. I was under the impression, from the case, that this was going to be a lot of stand up performances of Dane and the others. All it is is a series about them going on tour. There is nothing interesting about it. Nothing rewarding about it. I love Dane's jokes and all, but you only see about one joke from each comedian per episode. And the jokes that Dane tells are the one's from Retaliation. I wouldnt recommend this. I gave this 2 stars because it comes in a metal case."
2,More Reality Show Stupidity Than Comedy,"I am a huge Dane Cook fan, but he's been disappointing me lately. My biggest complaint about this DVD is that it does not include a clip of the full stand-up act. It's mostly about their 'adventures' on tour, providing only sample bits from the show. And the bits are FUNNY! I want more stand-up comedy, less reality show."
1,A waste,"I'm also a Dane Cook fan, but not this time around. Tourgasm had potential. And despite that potential - 4 comedians traveling across the country in a tour bus - this reality TV-like concept falls flat on its face. There was no comedy throughout the entire DVD. NOTHING WAS FUNNY! The comedians in it complain more than they make jokes. This DVD was a waste of money and time. Spare yourself.Dane, if you're out there, stop with this promotional stuff and give us something with more substance. Your bits are hilarious. Your future as a reality TV-star? No so much."
1,Boring and Not Funny,It took me several tries to get through these DVDs. How could someone so funny be this unfunny... His friends are annoying... there is no real drama...Stay away.
2,Kinda lame,"Don't get me wrong, I lovelovelove Dane Cook, but this DVD was not what I expected. I apparently thought it was the comedy tour that Dane does his skit about The Price is Right and the WHEEL OF BLOOD. Instead, it was Dane watching the interaction of three guys who seemed to need an endless supply of midol and pads. Anyone want to buy this from me?"
2,Succeeds where it doesn't really matter and fails where it shouldn't,"As a reality show staring four young comics traveling across the country, each with distinct personalities, styles and levels of experience this show (I guess you'd call it) is amusing. The interactions between the four are sometimes insightful, sometimes annoying, and often entertaining if not particularily hilarious. As a reality show it's ok and worth watching maybe once. But you know what would have made this show great? If it was funny. The standup routines including Dane Cook's might make you smile once or twice but there's little in the way of side splitting hilarity to be found. In fact there isn't any. No full set is provided either, rather just edited bits and pieces, dribs and drabs. For a reality show it's not bad, for a comedy dvd it's covered in flop sweat."
3,Dane Cook's Tourgasm?????,"Found the travel segments to lack the humor I was looking for in a Dane Cook DVD. Dane's commentary and various personal segments were entertaining and even enlightening, but the travel segments were not what I was looking for in a Dane Cook DVD. The tales of their travels assists in developing and understanding each comedian, but I was looking for more stage presence. Above average overall."
3,Not really what I expected,"I was a little disappointed that there wasnt very much stand-up. However, seeing the four of them trying to make it on the road was pretty funny."
4,pretty good dvd for the price,"for a 3 dvd set this was pretty good. it was funny and interesting. I would have to say my only complaint is that there was not say one whole concert performance on the DVD, that showed their entire show of all 4 of them, the Penn State show would have been perfect for that. If you like Dane cook and liked Vicious Circle, you will like this dvd."
1,Total Hack,Dane Cook is a hack that rips off material from other comedians. Don't give this clown your money.
5,First experiences,"This is a great book to read to young children before getting ready for a trip on a plane. It's always better to prepare them and talk about what they will be doing, what to expect and where they are going. This builds good vocabulary for them also. Bring it on the plane and it will get them to talk about what just happened and what they saw and how they feel. It's wonderful and educational. Take advantage of all their learning experiences."
4,Marriage is given by God,A great book for both Christian leaders and lay persons to help understand God's intended purpose for marriage. This book is completely scriptually based.
4,Watch the return policy,"The watch is very nice, however, my husband got 2 watches for Christmas. I tried to return this watch and because I bought it in mid November, it was over 30 days and they would not let me return it. Now I am stuck with 2 identical watches. I guess I should have given my husband his Christmas present on December 1st. I thought the company would make an exception for holidays, but I was wrong."
4,Great Compliment to The Ulimate Weight Solution,If you have not bought the Ultimate Weight Solution . . . you may want to consider reading it and then purchase the cookbook. The Ultimate Weigt Solution helps you get you into the mindset needed to live a healthier lifestyle. The cookbook gives new recipes that keep the array of food choices plentiful. Each week we pull out two new recipes which keeps the mealtime full of a few surprises rather than the same old diet food.
2,Extraordinary recipes,"I purchased this cookbook and I was disappointed that all the recipes weren't conventional.Except for maybe a soup recipe, all the rest you had to go out and buy additional weird items.It took me 3 minutes to thumb thru the book and I exchanged it today for the latest Body For Life for Women.If your looking for meatloaf or an easy chicken/fish recipe, this isn't for you."
1,Very Disappointed !,"I expected better from Dr. Phil. I have all his other books, and use his weight loss food guide daily. The recipes in this book are more for the gourmet, not the average family. For $18.20, there should have been more recipes also."
3,Weight Loss Solutions,"While the theory behind the book sounds great and the recipes certainly look good, I find that this book is not a practical application for me. Both my husband and myself work full time and to have to make everything from scratch is difficult when we sometimes work opposing hours. I have tried some of the recipes, just not in the format of the diet.\"
2,Disappointed,I have a number of Dr. Phil's books and they are great. This one is disappointing. I only liked about half a dozen of the receipes and a vast majority I wouldn't even want to try. Everyone is entitled to a slip up and I still think Dr. Phil is a real asset to people wanting to change their lives but this book just leaves me disappointed.
2,Not up to his standards,I was very dissapointed in this book. Did not feel it had enough recipies. There are no more than three or four that I will even try.
1,Book not received,"It is very difficult for me to review this item since I am still waiting for it. I have heard nothing from you people about the hold up and would appreciate an update on estimated delivery time for this book.Cheers,Sue Cook"
3,Interesting. Let's see where they go.,"You know, I don't hold much to the reviews that tell you about ""blending electronic and alternative"" or put up a whole story about the history of the scene.I care how it affects me, how it feels when I listen to it. Ok, having said that: at moments like they're really going to take off, and do something great with that guitar - let that man play! At moments it's like I'm listening to the Cure. And at moments it's going somewhere into Jesus and Mary Chain universe. Guys should really make up thier mind and they would have a great album - either a compacted, guitaristic version, or stretched out landscapes. So far, they are promising. Just not quite there."
4,Meditative Feel,"Recently heard ""Like you know"" on a snowboard video. Immediately got hooked. Excellent cd to snowboard/skate to."
4,"Closer to ""The Cure"" than MBV","After reading reviews that Film School sounded like My Bloody Valentine... or some more polished version of it, I might have to disagree. Upon the first couple of listens I was thinking... is this ""The Cure"" or a new ""TV21""? The vocals and arrangements are not too far off. I guess I can see the MBV shoegazing comparison from the swirling guitars, but not much else. I could point those interested to some current shoegazing bands... Fleeting Joys, LSD and the Search for God, and Japancakes re-interpretation of Loveless, as some great examples of where this category is going. These bands mentioned here do have sites on myspace and music is available on Amazon--take a listen...."
2,Like so many books... Not what I thought,"I thought this book would provide information (it does, but very little) about the lazy scholarship and outright denial that many leftist, particularly, in academia have about communism. The book ends up being a whole lot of name calling, and very little presenting of actual facts.I recognize the schizophrenic love affair the left has with communism and am always looking for more and more (as if it was needed) facts to show how evil and devestating communism is. Instead, this book belongs on the bookshelf next to Al Franken and Ann Coulter and more ideological shrieking.Don't waste your time, this book is so much fluff. I only gave this book two stars because, it rightly points out the state of denial someone must still be in to think communism is a good government system."
1,Did not shoot well in Trail NP,"Bought these to break in my new trail NP. Understood that the first 100+ shots would not shoot well so I bought these because they were cheap. The pellets were dirty and my groups were all over an 11 inch piece of target paper evne after 150 shots. Bought crossman pointed in same weight and went form 11"" group to 2"" group immediately and about 20 shots later cut one hole at 18 yards 1 inch wide (plus one flyer/my bad). I have heard the Benji NP could be a bit finnicky. I am here to tell you there seems to be some truth in the story. Daisy Pellets were dirty and lots of small pieces coated the breach after loading. Crossman pellets were clean and every pellet fit the same when loaded. Daisy was very inconsistent sizing but if this works for you in your particular gun that's great, it was terrible in mine. Just keep trying different pellets til you find one or two your gun really likes."
1,This are not accurate or consistent!,These pellets suck! We where shooting my benjamin trail .22 cal at the river. Had crossman hollow point premier and we where hitting our leaf targets from 50 yards out. Same gun shot these crappie pellets where hitting 3ft off target and inconsistant. Dont buy these pieces of junk. Touch them and they bend way to easy. Buy the crossman brand hollow point for accuracy.
1,Now I know why they were cheap,I picked these pellets up because they are cheap. I found out that they dont group well at all. I tried them in a Gamo Big Cat .22 and my benjamin Titan Nitro Piston .22. WoW they were bad. My advice would be use the crossman hollow points. I can easy shoot 40yard with a group of 2 inch with both rifles. I would say use them as a break in pellet but they will make you feel like you bought a crap rifle. Very sad.They shoot just as bad as the nonlead pellets.
2,Cheap for breakin the gun.,cheap for the price to break in the gun. not accurate compared the hollow point. many deformed out of box.
4,QUITE GOOD!,"I bought this album with the enjoyment of the Kerrang music channel and the weekly magazine. I picked it up and thought what the hell are all these tracks.I bought and to my amazement they were all quite good. Initial thoughts were that the Kerrang album would be full of the massive alternative rock bands e.g Limp Bizkit, Blink 182, Korn e.t.c instead it was full of some great songs.The best songs are Limp Bizkit - My Generation Puddle of Mudd - ? Deftones - Back to school Mudvayne - Dig (the stars of the Ozzfest)"
3,I think this is average but my kids love it,When we opened the product and started using it I was not very impressed...thought it was kind of lamb compared to legos or other building toys...but my kids love at and use it all of the time and it does spark their creativity. My kids come up with some really cool stuff...so worth having. Should be less expensive though for what you get...
4,Fun for 3+,"I got these for my son for his 6th birthday. His brother, sister and cousins love them as well. (Ages 3-10). They are fun, a different type of building from Legos and keep their interest for good stints of time. However, for the younger kids they are sometimes difficult to unsnap the pieces. Lots of fun, though none of the kids has tried to make any of the project sheets that were included."
4,nice choice,my 5 year old son's teacher recomended us to purchase this toy cause theyuse it to work psicomotricity at school and both our sons 8 and 5 liked it a lot so far they've only made standard figures but there's a lot to work with imagination as well.
3,Pretty but fragile,"This tree was pretty but very fragile, a few pieces have already broken. Not sure if I would purchase again."
3,Not impressed,The picture is more beautiful than the product. This one came with a piece knocked off. Has scenes but they don't tell a story. Not impressed. Sorry.
1,A Bad Trip of a book..acid indigestion,"Rehashed internet dribble on the subject of LSD or ACID as the inept trying to hide their ineptitude call it, trying to sound like they are in the know.I found more information on a Google search.Fortunately, for our children, most info on making this chemical is half-baked and half-a****.Books like this will only be a threat to their wallet, not their minds."
2,dont do acid,I thaught before my first trip i would read up on the drug so i purchased thisbook. I thaught it would be informative but it didnt help at all overall if u wana learn about acid dont read this book the only good part about the book was when they talk about persona experiances on LSD
1,Produto sem brilho,"O produto no tem brilho algum, seja por conta do ouro, seja pelos ""brilhantes"".Pensei em provocar uma boa reao ao dar o presente, mas confesso a frustrao.Apesar do desconto ser bom, é como dizem: ""voc tem o que voc paga"".No recomendo a compra."
4,Great buy for the money,"Love it, great fit, real sparkle!!!!Got the braclet yesterday, it is real nice put it with another diamond gold braclet looks real good. Hope the gold over silver holds up! Will order others from this vendor."
1,Returned bracelet!,"This bracelet was broken when received. It looked so cheap, not shiny, very dull. This was a special gift from my husband, and he was angry. It didn't look anything like what was published on the Amazon page. We returned it. We are very discouraged with the jewelry from Amazon."
3,18K Gold Over Sterling Silver Diamon Accent S Tennis Bracelet,"I like my bracelet it works for me, I wear it everyday to work and it is durable. That is why I buy these types of products not for quality of gold, but the durability. I like to wear good looking gold products without spending a lot of money for them and the product last a long time."
1,poor workmanship,"Silly me, bought this bracelet on face value. Clasp is too loose to stay closed and within weeks one had link snapped, rendering it unable to be worn and too expensive to be soldered in repair. Don't waste your money on a pretty picture. Cheap junk."
5,"Helpful, Concise and Practical","This little guide is useful to Messianic Jews or Jewish Roots-oriented believers who are considering celebrating Hanukah in some way. Adaptable to church use as a teaching tool too. It contains easy to understand summaries as to what Hanukah is about, its connection to Daniel 8 and Jesus' celebration of Hanukah, and its traditional observances.Great for families, home groups, etc. Complete with directions for playing Dreidel games, making potato pancakes (latkas -- or, as we Slovaks say, latci). It even includes suggested children's programs to teach the meaning of the holiday with a menorah motif.Nice booklet."
2,Poor Quality,"I bought the Sandisk Sansa thinking that it would be a good, durable mp3 player. Boy, was I wrong. About a week after I bought this player, the LCD screen got shattered after being in my pocket. I was able to return the player, and get a new one. About 2 months after I got the second player, the same thing happened. Now I am stuck with an mp3 player with a shattered LCD screen. If I were to do it again, I'd go with the smaller Sandisk player. It's less expensive, smaller, and is much higher quality. You may have to take some extra time to organize your music, but it pays off in the end."
3,"Good for random songs, but bad for album/artist organization","The Sansa apparently pays no regard to organization of mp3s into file folders, instead playing songs in alphabetical order (rather than by album or artist). Playing an ""album"" (folder) of songs requires digging into a submenu, and even then depends on all songs having well-formatted ID3 tags. The interface is somewhat clunky, and hard to use without looking (an important consideration for listening in the car)."
4,Sansa mp3 player by SanDisk,I am very pleased with the Sansa mp3 player from SanDisk... I like the radio too. Its great at ball games with it being so light (weight) to listen to the announcers broadcast the game and watch live. The sound is excellent ... I especially like the comfortable fit of the headphones... ear phones I guess you would call them ... they fit snug and comfortable in your ears. I also like being able to put a new triple A battery in right away when it gets low on charge. And the price beats anyone else... not to mention SanDisk is the number one maker of flash memory... sweeeeeetttt!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Poor Quality,"I was quite disappointed with my purchase.Cons:1) I could not figure out how to control the order of the song playing. It would only play in random or alphabetical order. I would have to change the file names for all the music files to make sure that the files play in the same order as the CD.2) The SD slot was practically useless. I have a 1GB chip and everytime the player powered-up it would spend about 5 minutes examining the files on the SD looking for new files.3) This is the big one. I was listening to the player in the car when I dropped it on the carpetted floor - it went dark and has not worked since. New batteries could not bring it to life.After spending a hundred on this, I have a dead MP3 player."
2,Not as bad as I thought at first,"I still like the their joystick players better, but I need to modify some of my previous comments:1. The sound quality is pretty good - after you replace the headphones and fiddle with the equalizer and SRS settings. 2. The click wheel for changing volume and settings operates raggedly. 3. It is much clumsier when strapped to your arm than the joystick player. 4.It is extremely difficult to get out of its clear plastic case without damaging the case - but you can correct this by wiping a very fine layer of talcum powder on the inside (got that from a forum). 5.Most annoyingly, whenever you turn it off and back on it forgets all of it's settings. You have to reset the volume, the equalizer, and the play order - you can correct this by reformatting the flash memory. It must be formatted in FAT 32. It comes natively formatted in FAT 16I'd bump it up to 3.5 stars but they won't let me change that on an edit."
5,MP3 Player...,"This is a pretty good MP3 player. It takes both MP3s and the WMA files generated from Windows Media Player, and doesn't need you to run a program when transferring files, or for you to keep the original copies of the MP3s on your computer, saving PC space. It's pretty durable too, and very simple to use, and upgradable. It plays FM radio, though it uses the headphone cable as an aerial, so you've got to make sure they're straight when you're walking about. It's got a sleep option, which saves batteries when you fall asleep listening to music. It takes AAA batteries, so rechargables might come in handy. It also has a stopwatch...I'm really glad this is the MP3 player I own."
5,SanDisk Sensational!,I bought this for my wife and she is EXTREMELY HAPPY with the unit! She uses it daily whenever she does chores around the house or reads her magazines. Its easy to use. Uploading songs is a breeze. Battery life is great. Very Good Product...
5,overall its great!!!,"i got this product and im so glad with it!!!its very easy to use, small and tiny!! the better of allits that has a great sound i like the earphones fits perfect in my ear and the sound its 100% perfetc!!! has a great bass sound...i preffer this one for me its better than the ipod!!! ipod has a pretty bad sound and peace of sh!!! of earphones!!! i dont care about the features like video photos whatever!!! and i love this one because the sd expansive lot...i use my 1gb sd card and thats it i got everything i need....the only flaw that happens is that the volume thing sometimes gone crazy...if i turn it down so quick the volume gone's up its like a little issue with the volume thing the litlle rotor volume thin that is on the top right of the device!!!otherwise im very pleasure with my purchase!!! and im planing to buy the 1gb gray one!!"
1,Died in two weeks,"This product was a complete disappointment to me. After reading a number of positive reviews, I purchased this device to use with audiobooks from Netlibrary. The first disappointment was in discovering that although you can play wma files on the e130, it cannot bookmark them. Therefore, it is difficult to find where you left off, especially when you're listening to an 11-hour book. The next disappointment came when after only two weeks, the device will no longer power up. And finally, I am frustrated by the fact that I paid $66 for this device and two weeks later the price is $54. Buyer beware."
1,"Bad Sound Quality, Stupid Software","I have been using Creative Muvo for a while, which allow you to play songs in a folder. But this stupid Sansa only wants you to sort your music by Artist, Album and ... Anyway, I like to edit play list on my computer and selete maybe only one or two songs from an album. I like to listen to difference singers. But this become very tough with Sansa, you have to either listen to all songs or you have to edit your Tags.I hope there is a firmware upgrade soon, which allow you to play a specific folder.The sound quality is so lame, WOW is totally a joke. It is not even comparable with my old Muvo.The only good think I can say is the SD expansion, but it looks so ugly when you put a SD card in."
1,Just one word...ugly,Really ugly mp3 player. Did the Sandisk designer ever check out the ipod? Features are just average. No surprise.
2,"Bad FM radio reception, subpar sound quality",Got one from eBay for $20 (shipping included). This is my second MP3 player. My previous one is a Creative Labs MuVo TX/FM 256MB. I think the MuVo is a better MP3 player then e130 in four ways:1. Better FM radio reception.2. Better battary lift.3. Better sound quality.4. Better built.
5,very easy to use,first mp3 player for me. i am very pleased with it. easy to useand very well made. can do a lot with it for a small price.
1,BUY SOMETHING BETTER,The headphones that come with this mp3 player have very poor sound quality. The buttons are very difficult to use and the volume blasts all the way up for no reason. It also drains batteries. I decided to buy an iPod and liked it a thousand times better.
4,Very affordable basic mp3 player with expansion option to 5 X capacity,"This is very nice mp3 player. It comes with all the accesories for downloading , listening and armband for running. Very easy to download music and has decent sound quality( might need better headset than the free one that comes with it). For the price you can not beat it. It takes roughly 100-130 songs as is but you can add SD card and add 2GB to the capacity increasing the number of songs by 4-5 x. Also if you download as wma instead of mp3 it doubles the number of songs so you potentially can get to 1000 songs with it. I have not tried WMA yet but that is what the instructions says."
4,"Pretty Good Music Player, Useless for AudioBooks",The pros & cons have been covered by other reviews but one BIGsurprise was there is NO Resume or Bookmark feature on these players.Audiobooks have to be cut into 3-5 min chunks or everytimeyou stop you have to fast forward through a hour or more toget back to your spot.I recommend the older smaller Sandisk player which at lease has resume.
4,Excellent Player...,"I bought this mp3 player few days back inspite of some negative feedback about it. I personally found it pretty good considering that its a flash memory based player which can be upgraded and also has FM inbuilt. The sound quality as as good as an iPOD , creative and i dont think quality is an issue except a few small bugs which can be overcome by experimenting a bit."
3,Depends what you want it for...,"I bought this player for one reason: It's the cheapest device compatible with Audible and AudioFeast. The integration with AudioFeast isn't elegant, but it works and I'm happy I can now easily use both services without all the workarounds necessary on my other player, which I now just use for music.The interface will never be confused with that of an iPod, but with relatively limited memory that shouldn't be too much of an issue.It's a pleasure to now be able to listen to public radio programs like This American Life and Talk of the Nation whenever I want. I can highly recommend this player for users of Audible and AudioFeast, but if you don't subscribe to those services and just want it for music, there are better designed players available."
2,Nice size. Audio so-so,I liked the fact I could replace battery instead of waiting for charge. Music was not so good sounding so I used for audiobooks only.
2,Dissapointed,"While this device is easy to use and gives you the ability to increase the storage with a SD card, I found the sound quality to be poor. The equalizer function changes the way it sounds, but the result is always lacking. The reliability is also poor. When I recived it, I could not get it to turn on. I tried different bateries but it still would not work. I contacted Amazon and they sent a replacement to me right away (5 Stars to Amazon for customer service). The second one worked. It is a battery hog."
5,I would've givin it 10 stars if I could!!!,"This thing is awsome!!! Its almost like a mini mini iopd!!! I got it for my birthday, and the sound is GRRREAT, except the provided headphones stink. It has every thing except voice recorder, it even has a stopwatch. It has a navigation feature which only jukebox players (like ipods) have. IT IS AWSOMEBUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Loved Alice Faye, Book is hard to Read","Book is about one of Hollywood's sweetest gals. What a voice!Too bad this book is so hard to read and the author inputs too much of their own opinion. I couldn't finish it, sold it."
2,Don't waste your money,"Frankly, I was disappointed in this book about the late Alice Faye. I was so thrilled to finally see a biography on her and it really let me down. Check it out of the library but don't buy it!"
3,ok crib,"It is an ok crib but the mattress is very thin, not much padding. I am hoping it will last long. It was very easy to put together but the side do not go down or up."
1,not expandable,bought extra expandable for growth option and does not expand. this crib is just the right size for newborns.but the option that you can make it into a bed does not exist.no support or contact information to assist with this. otherwise decent rocking crib.further. rocking stopper item does not match the installation sheet. it looks completely different and cannot install. instructions are not thorough enough!
4,nice crib,Really nice crib..I love it and my son like being in it the only thing was when I received it..it had a scratch on it..and it really gets scratched easily but other than that it still a nice crib.
4,Great Little Crib,"I love this mini crib! It is easy to move from room to room. It is big enough to accommodate my nephew well into his first year. Only thing is the mattress pad that comes with the crib is totally insufficient if you want the baby to sleep comfortably. Definitely get another mattress. Also, it's hard to find mini crib bedding (unless you order it here) but regular crib sheets can be tucked under and pulled tight so they fit fine. Quick shipping. Overall a great purchase!"
3,DaVinci Alpha Mini Rocking Crib - Cherry,"This was a life saver when my grandson was born. I kept it at my house for his visits and with two dogs in the house, it really came in handy. I only got about 9 months use out of it and he began walking . Very expensive product for only 9 months use and I had to purchase the mattress elsewhere and it was 55.00"
5,"Solid, AND Space Efficient","When my wife and I were looking for a crib, we were living in an one bedroom apartment. We wanted something mobile, that could be wheeled out through the bedroom's door. When my wife found this one, we bought it quickly. It arrived the next week. Assembling it was not hard. Along with the size and width, we especially enjoy the rocking portion of the crib. Even though our child is still a few months away, this crib fits what we need and expect for the little guy."
4,Ok--will keep,"Baby is not here yet, so haven't tested it with the baby. Installed it myself in about an hour. Came with a 4 page manual, but the instructions for installing the crib was on one page. Read other reviews about the flimsy mattress that came with this crib, so I bought theDream On Me 3"" Spring Coil Portable Crib Mattress, White. Fits perfectly. Now have to go by many sheets and a waterproof mattress pad.Crib is light. Like that it had wheels. If you don't want wheels, just take them off, and the crib becomes a ""rocker.""I do see a potential major weakness: the mattress support board. It is a piece of thin, maybe 1/4"" MDF board, surrounded or enclosed by 4 pieces of pine wood. There's another piece of wood (2 inch X 15 inch) going across the board, acting as a brace. If for whatever reason your child jumps up and down on the board, I think either the board will snap, crack or pop. Something to consider. I've attached images."
5,truly terrific crib,"This crib is sturdy and very easy to roll from room to room. Goes thru conventional doorways with ease. Park baby anyplace that's handy for you to hear him/her. Has comfortably held baby up to nearly a year old. Can get thicker mattress if using every day. Lowers to different levels as baby gets larger/more mobile. It's quite attractive and takes up so much less space than a full size crib. Perfect if children are close in age and the older one isn't out of the crib, but a younger sibling comes along. You're good to go for almost an additional year.......... We used bumper pads with ours as soon as baby was scooting toward rails. Before baby could scoot - didn't use bumper pads because air circulation is so important for tiny ones. Easy to purchase mattress pads, bumper pads and sheets for - be sure to designate ""mini crib"" not portacrib. We love ours - one at baby's house and one at Grandma's house too. Easy to roll out of the way when not being used."
4,Mattress included does not fit according to instructions,"It was easy to assemble (took less than an hour) and seems sturdy enough but I noticed that the instruction manual says: ""CAUTION: Use ONLY mattress/pad provided by manufacturer (which must be at least 36.75 in. long by 23.75 in. wide and not more than 5 in. thick)."" Meanwhile, the tag on the mattress that came included with the crib says that it measures 36.5 inches by 23 inches. Seems pretty inconvenient for the manufacturer to include a mattress that apparently can't be safely used with the crib. You'll have to buy a separate mattress."
4,So Cool,I actually got this bed as an alternative to caging my poodle and shih-tzu. It works perfectly for them. Great find.
2,Not the best quality product,"The product is made from really mediocre quality and scratches very easily. I would not recommend this item to others, i should have paid little more to get a better quality product. The mattress that the crib came with is just horrible."
4,Solid Construction and Easy Installation,"As the title says, the crib was easy to assemble and feels quite sturdy. The rocking feature will come in handy I am sure.The finish is pretty weak. I scratched it several times with just my fingernails! There are warning labels obnoxiously located on the most visible part of the crib. These need to be scratched off, since any attempt to peel them off failed in my experience. It was very difficult removing the labels without damaging the fragile coating."
3,Hard Finding Bedding,"Over all the crib was great to manuver from one area of the house to another. It's a great buy for anyone living in a small apartment but want the baby to have thier own space and not have to worry about them out growing it quickly like a bassenett...The biggest set back was finding bedding and when you did find it, the cost was just as much as a standard crib set. If your lucky you can find some great deals at Burlington Coat Factory. Whenever their stock was replenised, I would load up on fitted sheet for about $7 a pack. Luckily my grandma knitted my boy quilts to weigh out what I was missing. The mattress that comes with the crib is very thin. I would definatly consider buying an additional mattress to place on top. I found really good deals on line for memory foam toppers that fit this size."
3,radiata pine from new zealand,"After researching this crib and the type of wood used, you can call me crazy, but they use a glue called resorcinol when making furniture from this type of wood. Resorcinol contains formaldehyde. Am I missing something? I really need something for this baby to sleep in that is chemically free....."
2,Not too happy,"The sound quality on this CD is excellent. Unfortunately, just as the Tchaikovsky begins there is a false start or skip. I can't quite figure out what it is. I would like to exchange it for another copy, if possible. Please advise. Thank you."
5,"Neat, pragmatic ideas for a messy business","Bill has filled this book with tremendous value for any one working with existing systems of any kind. He builds in the flexibility of approach by mapping many common and not-so-common methods and strategies through his exploration of specific case studies. Chapter 3 is a valuable item on its own - rarely have I seen such a thorough and clear examination of all the different 'movements' in IT in the last 10 years. Nice job, Bill."
4,Ulrich gets it.,"William Ulrich gets it, and IT professionals who work with legacy systems would be wise to keep a copy of his book close at hand. In the face of the relentless evolution of the global digital marketplace -- an evolution that current economic conditions have done little to impede -- failure to heed Ulrich's analysis and advice is a strategic blunder akin to smoking at the gas pump."
2,Looks nice but I would not recommend it,"I have had this watch for less then 2 years and it constantly runs late. I had to take it for an adjustment. I worked ok for two weeks and started running late again. The Omega repair person told me that it is normal for these automatic watches to fall beind 5 seconds every day!!! When you pay so much money for a ""coveted Swiss watch"" you would think it should do the one thing its supposed to do, show time, precisely - that's not the case. Also, if you buy this watch online you have to mail it in to Omega for repair. If you want to take it for repair to authorized repair center, you have to pay for the repair out of pocket. If you need a watch that never needs batteries get yourself a nice Kinetic Titanium Seiko. It cost 3 times less, its lightweight and always precise. I had it before the Omega and loved it."
2,not what I was hoping for,"This wasn't what I expected. The choice of plays, with a few exceptions, was bland and poor."
3,Known classics and modern plays in one compilation,Known classics and modern plays in one compilation... most people would have come across at least half of the contents from other books and resources.
4,"History, Mystery,Romance & very well written.","Interesting intelligent characters in a Dickensian England setting. The heroine, Julia, has a brain in her beautiful head and she uses it. Morgan, the hero, is physically flawed and not the complete formulaic hunky-dunk we've become accustomed to. The romance is developed in an interesting way with a marriage at the very beginning of the story and a mystery surrounding the pyromaniac who burned Morgan's mansion, leaving him scarred both physically and emotionally.I think Lynne is a good writer who knows how to weave a clever plot, create interesting characters and keep the romance alive while we find out who-dunnit!"
4,4.5 stars!! feisty Beauty and redeemed Beast,"Almost perfect. A bit too long. Not enough insecurity, longing in Morgan's introspection. Julia though is AMAZING!! Loved her will to accept nothing but the best from society, from herself, from her husband. Good backstory, mystery. Could not pin down Who-Dunnit until the author showed her hand. Too many suspects kept me guessing, good mystery. Warm love scenes, not just sex, although the author makes you wait a while for it. Would I run out and shout to the rooftops that everyone should read this book? No. If someone asked me if it was an good read? yes. For the price it was certainly worth it. My keeper shelf? EHHH?"
3,not so good,I like this book but for 2.99 its over priced. its really a 99 cent book for $3. I expect more if I pay more. I read a lot of these and expect a lot for my money
3,Don't know yet,waiting for some down time to read this one. But it looks good and the reviews were good. Best way to get it too!
4,With this Kiss,"A fantastic read, great characters,well developed plot,satisfying conclusion,will definitely read more by this author. Giving away free books is making Amazon very rich."
4,with this kiss,this a story in old england that show the hardships of the people not wealthy. but some of the lucky people can make a difference with their help. it also is a good story about love over comming lifes tragities
3,"Enjoyable story, but. . .","I am enjoying the story, but the formatting is horrendous. Throughout the book, Kindle edition, there are random changes in font size. Paragraphs are sometimes indented 2 spaces, 5 spaces or 10 spaces. The indentation has nothing to do with MLA format. It's like the story was written in several different computers and no one bothered to check for format consistency. It's frustrating, especially since the story itself is so good."
4,"Great romance, wonderful character depth","Very enjoyable novel! A fairly typical historical romance, but if that is what you enjoy, you will enjoy this one. No spoilers, but the ending left me in tears. Although the characters had moments of insufferable stiffness, it was appropriate for the era and helped to heighten the tension. The romance was sweet, steamy, and expertly handled, the hero dark and brooding, wounded, flawed and yet strong and powerfully masculine, while the heroine, steeped in the mores of her era, was smoldering with sensuality, locked tight, with a deep sense of social justice far ahead of her time. Even the antagonist pulled at the heartstrings. I didn't figure this one out until the very end.My only problem was that the formatting of the book appeared on my Kindle as erratic, with wild changes in font size throughout. Just a little sloppiness that can be easily fixed, and nothing to do with the quality of the writing."
5,Beautiful Love Story- A must read!,Totally loved it. I enjoyed how the author kept the identity of arsonist until the very end. It kept me suspecting almost everybody but Jonathan Derrick. A rake Morgan who was burned during a fire trying to safe his servants and their children and Julia who has lost her father and has to live with her aunt and uncle; writes a column for a local paper and is recieving letters from the arsonist. They get married to save her being married off to some terrible individuals and to try to find out the identity of the arsonist. The author did a fantastic job writing this book.
3,mixed results so far,"The rim-clamp works well on my old concrete laundry tub.The faucet body is cast with only one hole, so be cautious to mount in a way that the plumbing lines can't be strained by rotation.The unit comes with the neck removed (to fit in the box.) If you put the neck in 1/8"" too far than you'll be VERY unhappy for about an hour and you'll need new o-rings.Right away there was a stem leak to deal with.It's a good looking faucet which fits the genre of the tub."
2,laundry faucet,"Nice cast faucet, mounting bracket is just fair for a wall mount (I had to make a wood filler to make it work). The bracket would not work or fit on my cast sink. The faucet arm is not cast, it is made out of very thin metal... a real disapointment (it looks like heavy duty cast in the picture). I'm sure it will not last as long as the valve part."
4,AN ADVENTURE EVERYONE SHOULD EXPERIENCE,"RETURN TO LOVE was a delight to read, the main characters Kaliq Faulkner and Trisha Terrence, total opposites, Kaliq being disable and Trisha running from her partner's unfortunate mistake, finds the true meaning of love. The Wyoming surroundings described so vividly, it takes your breath away, the Falcons(for you animal lovers, which I am, lesson in Falconry) soaring in the country side, the snow falling. Ms. Carlysle did a excellent job letting us know that just because you're disable, doesn't mean you don't have the same needs as others. This is truly a wonderful book, filled with plenty of Wyoming scenery, mystery and romance. Well Done! Ms. Carlysle"
5,Anggun is Phenomenal!!!!!!,"After listing to Anggun's ""Snow on the Sahara"" album I could not wait to hear her next album. ""Chrysalis"" is absolutely beautiful. It is really difficult to pick my favorite song, I would have to say it is ""Still Reminds Me"". Anggun's voice is so powerful and inspiring. I would recommend this album to any intense music lover."
5,If you don't own this album you are missing out!,WHen i first heard of Anggun I got her first album snow of the Sahara which i thought was a great album...then cam this album! All the songs on this album are wonderful and you can't go wrong with her voice! This is a must buy for any fan of great music! Go get it!
5,Anggun never ceases to amaze me,"Her soulful, sensual voice penetrates your soul echoing through your being, and dancing in your dreams. A CD to remember, and to cherish."
2,It's good for yoga,I refer this album for those people who love yoga and to the older peeps out there.
3,AMERICAN PHOTO SUBSCRIPTION,"I CAN'T VERY WELL REVIEW SOMETHING I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED! I KNOW THE QUALITY OF THE MAGAZINE IS GOOD, SINCE I'M BUYING IT ON THE NEWS STAND. THE SERVICE IN GETTING THE SUBSCRIPTION STARTED...WELL...I'M RESERVING JUDGMENT UNTIL I FIND OUT HOW MUCH LONGER I HAVE TO WAIT BEFORE I ACTUALLY RECEIVE IT."
1,American Photo -- the worst photo magazine ever,AMERICAN PHOTO magazine is a complete waste of any photographers time. The price for this subscription is so low because you get what you pay for. They can't even give these mags away at a news stand. I just throw mine in the trash - unread. If you believe in all this global warming and going green propaganda then call all the tree huggers because this mag is wasting a lot of trees. I'll be glad when my subscription runs out.
1,HARD TO REVIEW A PRODUCT I HAVE NOT RECEIVED,"I ORDERED AND PAID FOR MAGAZINES AND I HAVE NOT RECEIVED THEM ALL. I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED THIS MAGAZINE. I ORDERED 4 MAGAZINES, AMERICAN PHOTO, DIGITAL PHOTO, PHOTO TECHNIQUES AND SHUTTERBUG. I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED DIGITAL PHOTO NOR THE AMERICAN PHOTO MAGAZINE. 2 OUT OF 4. NOONE SEEMS TO BE ABLE TO HELP ME GET MY MAGAZINES OR MY MONEY BACK. I WOULD PREFER THE MAGAZINES, BUT I WANT MY MONEY BACK IF THEY ARE NOT GOING TO SEND THEM. I CAN'T SEEM TO GET ANYONE TO ASSIST ME. ANY SUGGESTIONS?"
3,Average magazine.,"A reasonably well balanced magazine. Better than Popular Photography in terms of content in that it showcases works of pros, talented amateurs and important historic photographic artists. Be reminded this magazine is published every ***other*** month (6 issues per year)Quite often resorts to scantily clad women on the cover to get your attention."
3,Art Inspiring,"American Photo showcases master photographers and their work. Yes, this sometimes means nudity, but in many place and for many thousands of years that has simply been a form of art. If you want to see great photos, on a beautiful glossy finish, pick up this magazine. If you want to know how the photographer snapped that shot this is not the magazine for you. Personally, I find this magazine as a source of inspiration. I page through, finding ideas along the way and the magazine is priced well for this purpose."
1,American Trash,"Images of severed hands, corpes with flies on them, piles of decaying bodies, etc. all in the name of ""art""...If you are like me and find these images disturbing you'll want to avoid this magazine."
1,Seriously Lacking Photography Magazine,"Seriously lacking in any real content. Subscribed for a year and opted not to renew even when renewal was offered at a major discount. Go with Popular Photography or even Outoor Photography. Don't forget about RangeFinder, which is available for free, but geared towards professionals and semi-professionals."
3,Moderately useful for photo buffs,"The magazine is moderately useful if you are into photography, either as a photographer or just someone who appreciates looking at nice photos."
2,Still waiting,"Sorry, I have yet to receive the first issue. I know the magazine from buying it on the newsstand, and I enjoy it immensely, but it hasn't beend delivered yet."
2,Out dated,"Received my first magazine in November, but it was the Sept/Oct edition, so a couple months late, and I still haven't gotten the current edition. They must be getting rid of the old stock as part of the new subscriptions. Looks ok, but nothing in the content or photos is very spectacular in this edition."
2,Where Is It??,"The photos are interesting, although I sometimes wish they'd say how they were done. The magazine sometimes promises more information at americanphotomag.com, but when I try to reach the site, it redirects to PopPhoto. I've tried to reach them at Bonnier (the publisher) by e-mail, but no one there seeems to know what I talking about."
1,not for me,This magazine had almost no new product reviews or technical articles. It was mostly just pictures and articles about other picture books. I could not wait for my 1 year subscription to end so that I did not have to throw this away anymore.
3,If you can get it at the right price - it's worth it.,"A very thin (approx 65 pages) magazine for those who appreciate good photography. Not a ""how to"" magazine but instead a showcase for some exceptional pro photos of various types. Well worth a look if you need to be inspired."
4,"Good price, Ok magazine","There is only a few good articles every month, but if you can get it for a descent price it's great to just skim through and feed your creativity."
4,The Worst Way to Pass a Test,"Jake, Sarah, Rob, Katie, and Dan are all involved in a scheme to get through mid-terms. When they're caught, everything comes crashing down on them.

This book will take you into the lives and points of views of these five eighth graders and will leave you wanting more."
3,gets the job done,"it was affordable, and it works. the umb started messing up after a month or so. its extremely sensitive to any kind of movement and comes disconected easily. its annoying, but it still works. great sound quality."
4,Cheap & Good,"Usrobotics USB Internet Mini PhoneCheap and good what a combination! It is also very easy to install though my only concern was that it would be in conflict with my DMX audio adapter.However the DMX audio adapter automatically shuts off when the USB cable is connected and starts up again when it is taken off on the fly.Reception is great, and it is very easy to use. I am sure that the high- end ones available have a whole lot of options which would make it even easier to use but I am very content with this phone and it's simplicity.Great buy indeed!"
3,Inexpensive and good quality sound,A great and cheap alternative to a Bluetooth Skype phone. Comes with a 6+ foot USB cable to allow reasonable movement. Sound quality is better than my experience with similar Bluetooth devices. Add more privacy to a Skype phone call within an office environment over laptop/PC speakers and microphone.The only negative is you do not have the 30 foot wireless radius that Bluetooth allows.
3,My friend's mistake,"I did not notice that this is not copatible for MAC. So I just give it to my friend. so I do not know about this stuff,,,sorry."
3,They left out the music!,"The music is missing! People care most about the music, before all else! What has been the IQ, over all these years, of all these companies who hold the keys to these precious early performances? Talk about being blind to a business opportunity - for decades and decades on end. IQ = 0.0001 !These people are unintelligent."
2,Poor manufacturing quality,So glad I paid less than half the MSRP of $30 for this item. The plastic molds do not fit together correctly. The sound is muffled and the volume wheel rubs against the plastic. I do not recommend this product
2,"It works, but there's a problem","I have a problem with their earpiece, in that it doesn't want to stay in my ear sometimes. It functions well when it stays in, but it's highly annoying to fish for it when I turn my head too fast.This works well if you have very large ear openings, or if you can wear a large earbud headphone with no problems.I had to return this item."
4,A Novel to Keep You Up Late at Night,"While there are some very melodramatic moments in this novel, it is all in all, one of the best thrillers I have read this year. There might be a little trouble with following the complexities of Scots legal partnerships but I thought the author did a fair job at clarifying the essential points.The heroine is likeable and brave, the book is fast paced and engaging. More than one character in this novel is ""mad as a box of frogs""-- a great phrase. I can hardly wait to read the upcoming sequel."
1,"Melodramatic, sensational, poor","I've just finished reading the novel. The protagonist is unrelievedly nasty & ugly; it's hard to find the smallest sympathy for her--which is necessary in a plot with a Damsel in Distress. The plot itself is highly melodramatic, sensational, and confusing. The SURPRISE ending might have come from some other novel since it has no logical connection with the plot. But, yes, it IS a surprise--in stupidity. Many loose ends none of them tied up.I hope the writer quits with this one novel. I'll never read anything she writes again."
1,This company is not reputable,"I wanted to purchase this item in order to enjoy the last two games of the NFL season in comfort. I need them prior to December 23, 2006. I was promised delivery before December 18th. The item did not show up and on December 20th I contacted the company by telephone and never got a customer rep so I had to leave a message. The company did state via prerecorded message that they were having technical problems with their ordering system but would have it resolved and would contact anyone who had placed an order recently. The company never contacted me and I never received my item. I am very displeased by this purchase as the company does not call you back which means to me that they do not need your business. Find another company with a reputable name and sales history! I will not purchase anything from this company in the future."
5,40 Year Friendship,"I bought this book almost 40 years ago. I was surprised and pleased to see that it is still ""thee"" book. Everytime I get stuck for help, I go to this book. Now I am planning courses to teach pre-school teachers in Japan. ""Thee"" book is open once more. Any chance it is available in Japanese? Thanks Lowenfeld and Brittain!!!"
1,Band Sender,The sender sold as good. They sent it out good and broken. Most pages written in and the binding is broken. This book is a throw away.
3,"Quality of ""used"" book","If you insist on getting a coloured version of the book, try to contact the book-seller first and ask for more inforamion. Hopefully they will reply. For your information, I ordered one used book from a bookseller who did not reply me at all after waiting for 7 working days. Decided to risk the chance and order the book. Unfortunately, that used book is totally printed in black and white. Poor printing quality. But considering the warning that was given in year 2005, I expected this to happen anyway. Bewere buyers."
4,find inspiration in all things,This is a picture book biography of Langston Hughes. It tells us that he got inspiration for his first poem while listening to the sound of a train. He was on the way to visit his father in 1920. He starts to think of all the people who have seen these sights before him and what life might have been like for them. He writes his famous poem on a piece of scrap paper and the rest is history!The book was written in picture book/ story book form. Although it was a non-fiction book it was fun and easy to read.We would recommend this book to others who are interested in knowing more about Langston Hughes. This would be helpful to students who might be researching his life for school projects.
3,Tracking is the key to the truth.,"Narration very good. Stories as okay. We are surrounded by all kinds of virus and bacteria that drive us crazy. Learning how to deal with these organisms is very difficult, because first of all you have to find which one is the problem and maybe when you find out it's late."
5,"First class art work, a style for everyone.","I was intrigued by the cover in the book store so I decided to pick it up. Wow, was I ever impressed. I used to be into comic books and art in general while in high school, but never in my wildest dreams would I have envisioned what the medium would become. Yes, I am getting old and no, I haven't been keeping up with comics. So, there may be better out there but not with so many different styles: One in pastel, one comp. generated, another in oils, and even a more traditional pen and ink section (all executed exquisitely).If you are interested in finding out what can be accomplished stylistically and artistically in the world of graphic novels look no further. I can't wait to find volume two."
3,artbook,"came quickly enough... book wasn't in the greatest shape, but it wasn't described to be either- so it was a fair deal"
3,stove blower noisy,"Blower needed a few adjustments before working properly. Moves air nicely, however, the noise and vibration is not acceptable at any speed. I have placed a small 8 inch summer fan behind my wood stove. On slower speeds it super quiet and moves a lot of heated air."
4,Great for Kids,"I have used this for all 5 of my children. It is great for those who are just potty training - sometimes they just can't wait for an exit with a clean rest room. Small enough to ""hide"" in the car and no leaks! My only caution is be careful with the female adaptor. Not always the neatest..."
3,DISAPPOINTING CONCLUSION,"While somewhat of a struggle to get into the story, once I was in I was hooked. Yeah, Davenport is a shameless womanizer -- and a cop w/ few scruples. But I still went along, hoping for twists and turns and a tantalizing conclusion. Unfortunately, the work ran out of gas leaving me saying, 'OK, that's it?' Sandford could learn from David Baldacci and John Katzenbach for keeping his stories exciting till the very end. Thumbs down."
4,Rules of Prey by John Sanford,"This is the first book in the ""Prey"" series I've had the chance to read. With all of the books by Sanford with the word ""Prey"" in the title, I honestly didn't think they would be very good, but I was pleasantly surprised. ""Rules Of Prey"" is outstanding. I know it's an old cliche, but I found myself not wanting to put it down once I began reading it. I first started reading the Virgil Flowers books by Sanford and all three are great. Lucas Davenport is the detective, leading character, in the ""Prey"" series and in my opinion, he's as good or better than Flowers. If you enjoy reading books by Michael Connelly, James Patterson, or Lee Child, I recommend that you try the John Sanford books. ""Rules Of Prey"" will have you wanting more of Lucas Davenport. I've already bought the first eight books in the ""Prey"" series."
3,thin line,"There is a thin line between the good guy and the bad guy here.They both commit murder(thats exactly what you call how Lucas gets rid of the bad guy.And he also plants evidence;i'm sure we should'nt be cheering him on for this.He's a womanizer who has no regard for the women he beds,finding out he's going to be a daddy doesn't get in the way of the next conquest.It's an interesting thriller;but the kindle store has many books that are just as good if not better than this series for a little as 99 cents.By the time you read this whole series at 9.99 each,you will have spent 210.00 plus 17.00 tax.I just dont feel like its that good a series."
3,First Novel,I like John Sandford novels/mysteries and decided to start from the first or beginning novel. I can tell from the writing that this is his first although it is very good and keeps your interest up. I have now read two more and the writing has improved but the original characters remain true to form.
4,Kept me in the dark,"I chose to read this book for a school project. I ended up really enjoying it and wanting to read the rest of the ""prey"" series. The characters and the plot made me not want to put the book down. Lucas Davenport(the detective) was very charming and his character was very well thought out. What scared me the most was the killer who called himself maddog, was a lawyer, who everyone knew. He was a normal guy to the outside world. It really shocked me when the author mentioned Duluth MN because it just proves that it can happen anywhere, and you shouldn't trust people that may look like they have a good life and they seem normal. I think the ending could've been better if the killer would've dissappeared and it left you in suspence as to what happened to him, then have him pop up in a following novel."
4,Rules of Prey,"This book was my introduction to John Sandford. Overall, I think the book is well written and the characters well developed. I loved the way the ""bad guy"" went down."
4,A riviting read.,"Rules of Prey by John Sandford ~ Berley ~ April 1990I read this one 20 years ago when it first came out, and reading it again in 2011, I still found it to be a riviting read. Lucas Davemport is a flawed man who often crosses the line to get his man. The cast of characters are well developed and help shape our view of our hero's character. Lucas is respected by his peers and adored by the ladies."
4,Really had a interesting twist,"I wasnt sure how i was gonna like this series, never reading anything by john sanford before. I really got into the book and could not put it down toward the ending. Definally recommended and i plan on reading book 2 soon!"
1,terrible,Yeah i really dislike this book. All i have read was like 50 or so pages and it sucks so bad. I am not a fan at all of john sandford. I love james patterson books and this is nothin like his books.
2,"Overrated, with anti-NRA vitriol",I was hopeful I'd find a new mystery writer after exhausting so many others. The story line of Rules of Prey was tedious. Lucas makes Woods' Stone Barrington appear the amateur womanizer!It was astounding that this author would choose to toss in some strong anti-NRA language. That's enough to cause Sandford to be crossed off my list of preferred writers.Are there really avid cop story readers who don't appreciate the constant efforts of the NRA to ward off the gun control left? This career Mexican border law enforcement officer offers our neighbor to the south as a prime example of what can occur when law abiding citizens are denied ownership of weapons of self defense. Butchery!
1,awful,"I will never read another John Sanford book. I stopped reading Sanford's Bad Blood because it was so terrible. Rules of Prey was better, but not by much. I actually finished reading this one. John Sanford can write. I'll give him that, but writing skills is not why I gave him one star. His main character in Rules of Prey treats women despicably, and they're alright with that, like that's going to happen. Furthermore, the main character is depicted as a man who feels that the ends justifies the means. I don't feel I have to agree with everything that a character might do, but Sanford's characters leave me with a feeling of yuck. I don't like being in their heads. I don't want to have anything to do them. I don't like them -- any of them. The sooner I can forget about this book the better. I have concluded that I am not a John Sanford fan."
1,Kindle edition is more than the paperback,"Depending, of course, on where you buy it--the cost is the same from Amazon. Outrageous. Won't buy this book, or buy from Berkley/Penguin, until it's offered at a fair price. Amazon lied in promoting the Kindle as a lower cost way to read.The rating, obviously, is directed at price gouging, not artistic merit. However, it reflects on artistic merit in that Sanford, and Berkley, allow it. No shipping costs. No printing costs. Same price. What's wrong with this picture?[Edit: The rating reflects on the ethical merit of Sanford and Berkley, as opposed to artistic.]"
4,OMG - What a Rush ...,"Not your cuddle-up in front of the fire mystery thriller ...I have previously not given much thought to any of the ""Prey"" series, considering them too violent, too stereotypical, or something. Boy - was I in for a surprise! Lucas Davenport, the main character of these books, has a well developed persona from the get go. This being the first book of the series, as well as one of John Sandford's earlier works, was refreshingly riveting and I found myself not wanting to be distracted from reading more and more as I got into the book - I just finished this and have already started on the next book, ""Shadow Prey"" and it is equally as attention-getting as ""Rules of Prey"". I do love good mysteries - particularly when the characters get to evolve through development in ensuing books. Thank you Mr. Sandforda good read - not for the faint-hearted"
3,Decent read,"I had read easy prey. It remains the only book i've read in less than a day. I got this one, the 1st in the series..Pretty good cat and mouse with the maddog and his victims. Lucas the main player, a term not yet coined when the book was written, plays the main role. He, a supercop, ladies man, marksman, and game inventor, is a little much, but a good character non the less. The clever maddog is over matched. Lucas still carries on with his life, as it should be in good versus evil. The book was probably ultra-modern 12 years ago with the computer game stuff. I give Mr. Sandford credit for the start of a good series."
4,Surprise surprise it was GREAT!,"I have passed over the PREY series for some time.I thought how exciting could a detective story be set in Minnesota? However I was searching for something new and decided to give it a try. I was not sorry that I did. The story overall is excellent,it keeps you reading from the first page. Lucas is a fantastic character and his dark side is especially enjoyable(We all like to see the main charcter kick butt as well as solve the crime and save the day). Sandford's writing is right up there with James Lee Burke.I think that the most important thing is that the story flows, it does not bog down. Pick this one up you will not be sorry you did."
5,First of the Prey series,"This book introduces us to Lucas Davenport, the hard-edged Minneapolis cop with a quick mind and an even quicker trigger finger.Davenport must track a killer who tries to reason away any pattern to his killings. I hope that this will be the first Prey book you read, that way you will be able to follow Lucas Davenport as he grows as a person. And that growing process is, to me, one of the best reasons to keep reading this series. Not to mention, the great edge-of-your-seat thrills and suspense of the hunt for killer."
3,Thump Your Chest - Grab Female,"Lucas is a living breathing cliché, but at least he shoves it in your face and makes you like it. He takes the law into his own hands and isn't afraid to score chicks while he does it. Sound chest bumping and sexist? Well, it is. But for some reason, you forgive Davenport and cheer for him.I picked this book up to learn more about the Twin Cities. Sanford delivered on his lifelong relationship with the community and gave me what I wanted.The technical jargon was smothered on a little thick, but I'm sure cop geeks will love it. The serial killer was the most interesting character to me. I haven't pulled the trigger on any of Sanford's other books yet. The second in the series doesn't grab me with its premise, and I hate to move forward without reading it. That being said, I'm not willing to give up on Sanford. This book was about what I expected, but delivered above par."
4,Scary---Scary-----Scary,"This is my second Prey book. I read one and went back and read Rules, which is the first one and will read them in order. It got my attention on the fist page and held it all the way through. Lucas Davenport is excellent in his mind games with the killer. He does what ever he has to. I could actually feel chills going over my body when he finally figured out the mans name. Then could he get to the last kill on time or not????? I really did not like Jennifer Carey, I guess if the author has written a character so well you despise her he has done a good job. If you like a thriller that will hold you attention this is it."
4,Rules of Prey,"This was an exciting, intriguing and suspenseful robbery/murder mystery. It gave some insight to some of the later ""Prey"" books I have read and reinforced my opinion that Baldacci is a great mystery storyteller."
5,Just The Beggining . . .,This is the first of many John Sandford books I have read. The chapters ping-pong between detective Lucas Davenport and the killers mind. Sometimes you can't tell who's mind you're in! Very suspensefull and it really keeps you interested. I would recommend this book to people who like series books. The prey series in general is all suspensful and thought provoking.
3,I Will Continue For One More,I did not like Lucas Davenport very much. He was to perfect. He did not make many mistakes. Others enjoy the series so I will continue for one more.
5,Favorite Author,John Sandford has been my favorite for many years. I have read and/or purchased all of his books. Somehow I missed this one and was surprised to find it. It is number one in Lucas Davenport series.
2,Too many swear words,"two stars..not for the story.. but for the gratuitous profanity; i just cant get past this!! Sandford is too good a writer..and too successful to need this , so why does he do it?? I went through my copy and used whiteout on the swear words!!(and there were a lot) and then looked at the text again. Every word missing, or every phrase , was totally unneeded....did not contribute at all to the text. So.. the prey series books are very good.. easy to read etc..but be forewarned.. there is a lot of profanity. If this does not bother you then go for it. I will use library copies..not my books so it does not bother me that much.. but i will not pay $$ for these books. three stars for the story...two stars for the book. I note that sandford is not alone in this new?? trend; the later Parker books(Donald Westlake) also had unneeded words... I guess i will just have to adapt.. not like!! but adapt. Everybodies doing it(not Lee Child so far!!)."
5,Best Davenport Book I've Read So Far,"I've read and thoroughly enjoyed the Prey books, but this, the first of them, is the best so far. Sandford has created a totally authentic character in Lucas Davenport, and his action-packed plot zings along realistically with little need for contrived coincidences or phony distractions. Sandford gives us the kind of thriller that you can sink your teeth into. And as the plot turns, he gives us a lot of insight into the ways of cops, the media and, of course, a most heinous serial killer, affectionately referred to as ""maddog"". Although I still have a few more Prey books to go, I am confident that this will stand out as one of Sandford's best."
4,Well Done,"""Rules of Prey"" provides a perfect introduction to Lucas Davenport. In addition, the criminal aspects of the book work and provide the kind of action needed to keep a reader interested."
4,FIRST LT. LUCAS DAVENPORT BOOK,"I guess you could say I am a johnnie-come-lately to the world of mystery/detective genre, so years and years after publishing, I pick up the Prey series. RULES OF PREY and its hero, Lt. Lucas Davenport are great. Davenport is different being a cop with money and not being a really funny guy like some detectives. A real change of pace for me and I enjoyed it very much. Looking forward to the next book. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
3,"Evil villian and a oversexed, belligerent detective",Lucas Davenport is smarmy enough to get down and dirty with the worst villians. Wish Sanford had explained Vuillon's past and what brought him to Minneapolis from Texas. Had Louis killed elsewhere? Lucas' relationships are pretty shallow but somehow he comes across as caring for his women friends. His relationship with the nun is interesting and should be developed more. All around I liked this book but was a little disappointed in the ending.
3,This book had more to be desired,"I was hoping for more intense, mapped out killings. The murderer was not very scary compared to most novels. Where was the terror and suspense? This book was very mild in the goosepimples department. There was too much information about Davenport and not enough about the killer. The things we did know made him less threatening as the story went on. If he had had more homicidal tendancies and didn't plan everything out so carefully and had been more unpredictable, he would have scared me. The ending was the worst."
3,"""Prey"" the Rest Will Get Better","This is the first book I've read by John Sandford. I have most of the books in this series and had planned to read them consecutively, but after reading ""Rules"" I've decided to give myself a little break. Don't get me wrong, I liked the book, but it's snail's pace didn't help any. I knew more about Lucas Davenport, supercop, superlover than I did the killer. Davenport's history could have been done throughout the series. You know, a little at a time. I feel that other than him being a bed-hopping cop, there's not much else. I didn't know what drove him as a person or as a cop. The same for the killer. He was never fully developed. Instead of feeling contempt for the killer, I pitied him. Initially, maddog's parents were mentioned but nothing ever came of them that might have explained his way of choosing his victims. I didn't get my ""why"" satisfied. I'll give the other books a try. They have to move faster than ""Rules"" did."
3,"Interesting story, Uninteresting character","I can't tell a lie. Rules of Prey did keep me mildly interested throughout. So why am I bashing the book? I couldn't stand Lucas Davenport. Maybe this book was written with a male audience in mind, I don't know, but the man is a pig. He jumps into bed with every female he meets and seems to enjoy juggling completely sexual, and thoroughly unemotional relationships. Okay, Louis Vullion is kind of interesting as a serial killer, but he just didn't grab me and hold on the way I hoped he would. I kept wishing Sandford would plunge a little deeper into the psyches of both Vullion and Davenport, but it never happened. The reader is kept perpetually at arm's length, which is a shame, because this could have been a damn good book."
2,Couldn't wait for it too end!,"The main character is a womanizer who would be a modern-day Human Relations nightmare. I found myself cringing at the condescending way that he talks to and treats people. The plot was okay, but I just couldn't get past the jerk. He seems to have the common interest at heart, but comes off as a 1940's detective from a B flick."
3,"Poorly written in parts, gets good when story picks up","This book shows that, in his years as a journalist, John Sandford learned a lot about the relationship between police and the media. Unfortunately, the story is lacking at times, and the reader has to slog through lengthy portions of procedure talk - the book ends up with a lot of dialogue-heavy scenes that may sound impressive and official, but the story stands still. That said, at times when the plot picks up, it's much more enjoyable. Didn't get much out of the computer game subplot. Unnecessary character over-development. Really liked the ending. Clever writing."
4,"Good, page-turning thriller","While the plot of this book seemed a bt formulaic and predictable, Sandford still manages to keep the reader hooked using some well-written characters and an interesting plot that keeps you wanting to know what is going to happen next.I don't normally read many thrillers, but I picked this up when I was starved for something to read, and I was not disappointed. This book is definitely worth reading, but be careful, because it's possible you will get hooked. After reading Rules of Prey, I continued reading the Prey series for another 10 or 11 books before I was finally able to wrestle myself away from them."
2,The ending ruined it for me,"I was interested enough to keep reading, but I found the pacing slow in spots. There seemed to be a lot of interaction with the media.The best parts of the book were with the main character, but I still didn't really care for him. He's a playboy who has one woman pregnant while he sleeps with another, and still fantasizes of yet another. Meanwhile he had proposed to the pregnant woman...talk about morals that are out of whack.I wanted to like this book but the ending ruined it for me. The last 10-15% of a book should have the reader eagerly anticipating the ending; sadly I just wanted to reach it. Once I got there, I felt like I had wasted my time and money."
4,Standard Fare,I read this mystery because Mark Harmon starred in the made-for-TV movie. It was fast-paced and kept my attention; I'll likely read more of this series.
4,"Great characters, good story","The development of characters was completely believable. I was hoping this would be an exciting, page-turning suspense. It did not disappoint. I enjoyed the book. The storyline was somewhat predictable, but still exciting."
3,Rules Of Prey-Breaks the Rules,"Lucas Davneport, the hero of the story, proves time and time again to be as cold-blooded and violent as any killer he encounters, and this book gives the perfect example of this. To see how humans really react when they take a life (assuming they are not psychopaths, which Davenport may well be), read Dennis Lehane's books such as A Drink Before the War, featuring Patrick Kenzie and Angie Somethingorother.Aside from this little fact, this book was a very good read, filled with suspense and violence. If you're in to those things, you will probably like this very twisted novel."
4,Great start,"I got started on this series by reading a couple volumes that have been released in the last three years or so. I decided to go back to the beginning and see how Davenport started out.It was nice to see where the money came from and that he began as a tough guy. As with the other books I've read, I'm not wild about his main girlfriend/wife. The game development detail adds a lot to the character and how he works.The hunt for the maddog kept me hooked. There's nothing quite like the take-down of an obnoxious jerk, for a satisfying read."
2,long and drawn out,This book is long and drawn out and not all that interesting. I liked one of Sanford's other books and thought I would read this one. Big mistake.
5,The best study yet written of McNamara.,"A complex, meticulously researched subject is combined with an unusual and disarming writing style, which is informal and first-person. Woven throughout, in an amazingly relevant way, are the stories of the lives of five people profoundly affected by the war.The details of McNamara's disillusionment with the war are fascinating reading, and serve to indict -- and convict -- McNamara on what many think is his greatest crime: he didn't speak out against the war after he was removed from office. Hendrickson suggests, compellingly, that if McNamara had campaigned against the war after leaving office, using all his intelligence and persuasiveness, that today there may have been a ""McNamara Prize,"" similar in stature to the Nobel Peace Prize."
4,Really interesting!!,Well researched with some interesting insights. If you are fascinated by America's involvement in Vietnam then this is a must read.
2,"Excellent concept, terrible writing","This is a fascinating concept and involves fascinating research. The writing is terrible, almost unreadable. The material is very strong stuff, perhaps it overwhelmed the author. Where was the editor on this book? I would have to say that they were asleep at the wheel.This is a particular waste because so much first hand information seems to have been entrusted to the author."
2,"Well researched, badly written","I was so put off by the writer's suffocating style that I could not complete it. The best thing I can say about this book is that it is well researched, but I have to wonder if it was not just too well researched. Do we need all this detail about both McNamara's maternal and paternal antecedents and those of his wife and ex-girlfriend?The author is way too much in love with irritating literary devices such as his use of nouns when pronouns or proper names would suffice (""a secretary of defense and a Quaker"" instead of ""McNamara and Morrison""). Once or twice and it's clever, but these devices are used continuously throughout the book. The work would have been better and more readable had it been half as long."
1,"Wrong, wrong, wrong","Bothe McNamara and Hendrickson were wrong about the war then and wrong about it now. It was eminently winnable. Hendrickson's one-sided propagandistic account is biased, dull and hysterical in tone. His prose is dense and obscures rather than elucidates the subject. And Norman Morrison deserved to burn -- it's just a good thing that chance at the last moment took his daughter Emily our of harm's way. Ultra liberal pap. Pass, and buy Ron Spector's After Tet instead"
2,Cheap and Small,This magnet was much smaller than I expected. It didn't look like it was of very good quality either. I was disappointed.
5,After 15 years...,"After 15 years of searching, my cat has finally found a woobie! These cushiony sticks are easy for her to hold onto with her paws and she likes chewing on the ribbons on each end, which are easy on her teeth and gums. She likes the little bit of catnip in them but I think she really just likes the ribbon massaging her gums. She wore out her first one and when I went back to PetSmart for more, I learned that PetStages has discontinued making this item, so I ordered a few sets through Amazon while they're still available. PetStages makes a similar toy now that's a fish with catnip in it and ribbons on the tail but she couldn't hold onto it as well and quickly lost interest. In any case, I've purchased a few toys from PetStages and they make quality products."
1,Can't hear it! Wouldn't want to!,"The quality of this video seems to be very low. I have to turn the volume up all the way just to be able to hear it a little bit. I tried it in my DVD player and my computer, and I tried other DVDs just to be sure-- the problem is definitely this DVD. Additionally, the material itself is boring- my nephew (age 7) would never sit through it. I had a hard time with it, too. I thought it was going to be fun and it got great reviews from others, but overall it's just not what I expected and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
5,My Cougar purrs again!,"Needed a new fuel pump and I was told to get motorcraft since it was a Ford product! My 94' Mercury Cougar runs like new again, and the gas mileage is much better! Thanks so much Amazon for carrying this product!"
4,Cute book,"Love all the colorful pictures and monkey faces are fun for the kids to touch. Each page has the monkeys doing something different, something you can use for learning. ""That Monkey has a cookie, oh oh that money hurt his foot, etc.""Very cute and a book you can 'sing' which makes it a bit different."
5,Kids love this story,My grandchildren just love this book. So I am now buying it for baby showers & birthdays! Make sure when read you add some expressions & actions with it. They will be reading it to you after awhile.
5,eight silly monkeys,"Our grandson has enjoyed this book since he was one, he is now 20 months old. He wore the first copy out, and this is his second copy. Pappy and I know it by heart!"
1,Poor video quality,"Do your self a fovorite, buy other card for same money.this is very old card introduced in 1997.that time maybe it was a good card, but now in these days it will dissapoint you.get Rodeon 7000 or something better.I would not recomand this card for gammers!too slow , poor quality video"
3,Ok Card,This card no one chose 2 write a review for so i guess i will.Its ah good card especially for the price but if u have extra cash dont be afraid 2 use it 2 get something better.For gamers this card may be a lillte 2 soft for u.I recommend something a little higher cost. Remember Nirvana and Iron Maiden Rulez
3,Not quite what I expected,"I guess I'd hoped for some new, more creative activities and games. Many of these are just simple little things that myself, and I'm sure others, find themselves doing naturally. There were some new ideas, though, and I'm sure it might be a good resource for others."
1,"Good brush, but poor battery","I have had several toothbrushes from Braun, and so far they were all fine.Up until this one. It brushes good, although the replacements are quite expensive. Bad is bad about this is that the battery wears out way too soon in my opinion. When I bought it I was already amazed that this expensive brush had a Ni-Cd battery, while the other cheaper ones had a better Ni-Mh battery.I guess Braun needs a new major income after the patent of the rotating brushes run out. This kind of expensive toothbrush with such a short life span is just bad. The brushing is as good as the cheaper ones."
4,Good but older style of electric brush,"I've been using the Sonic Complete (with rectagular vibrating brush head) for 2-3 years now. It is a definite improvement over the various manual toothbrushes I used before. But from further discussion with the hygiene-ist, I think perhaps the newer models with round and rotating brush heads do an even better job. The cost of this one had been large enough, I decided not to change right now.I'm also a little disappointed that replacement brush heads are so costly. I use them longer than packaging recommends. Overall, because of the improved cleaning results, I can report I'm glad to be using this electric toothbrush."
2,"Nice toothbrush, poor battery life",I don't have any complaints about the performance of this toothbrush. I was happy with it until the rechargeable battery gave out 2 years and 4 months after buying it. Seems it should last longer for almost one hundred dollars. I called oral-b. They basically said to buy a new one. You cannot replace the battery. They did not come across very friendly when I spoke with them.
4,Mystery & Romance with Personal Growth,"An excellent faith-based book for teens & younger adults! Newly graduated Ashlyn Kennsington learns how to make positive life-affirming choices, to choose friends wisely, and weaves the daily elements of her faith-based outlook into this adventure of mystery & romance. Wonderful examples of application of prayer and LDS scripture reading to daily life blend naturally with the tale."
4,Easyy Read,Good introduction to using natural products/methods to heal the body. Much more information geared toward female issues than male issues.
2,Very simple home remedy book,"The book is written with very simple words. Sometimes, it feels like listening your not even grand but grand grandmother and you think how primitive but effective everything in that book can be.The book has a lot of contadictive to the common knowledge materials. Some believes presented in the book contratict with believes of other cultures (example: the theory of hot and cold, ""quick change in temperature is the root cause many physical ailments"", go and tell this story to Russians who believe that after hours of hot bath you should jump in ice water and many physical ailments will be gone???). However, even though this book definitely cannot be considered very educational, some remedies presented with such simplicity that can be effectively be used at any home."
5,Maya love,"A fabulous book, well written and so much solid information from the women who learned straight from a Maya Healer herself, Don Elijio Panti. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking/needing ""real"" healing... laughter and prayer are the best medicine!"
1,Péssima produo,"Um campeonato como este merecia um vídeo com produo profissional. Apesar de ser um apaixonado por Tango, nem isso salvou minha opinio... No gostei e no recomendo.:("
1,The New Formula Doesn't Work!,"I loved Grant's Ant Stakes until they took the arsenic out. I had great success two years ago with them, then bought the new ones and they didn't work. The ants just kept coming. Then I found on old one in the back of my cabinet and put it out and it got rid of the ants. That was 2 months ago. I scoured all the old hardware stores in town, but they had sent the arsenic ones back to the company. I think some states might still sell the old formula, but not California."
1,"Grants ""used to"" kill ants","I used these first in 2008 when I had ants everywhere. I haven't seen an ant since then. Naturally this spring when I saw ants again, I went to the store and bought another pack of grants stakes and put them where I saw ants. I noticed this time however the ants don't pay them any attention. I have yet to see one ant crawl anywhere near the stakes. I did notice they used to be metal around the bait now it is all plastic. I am not sure if that contributes to the problem or not. Either way this time they have been a complete and utter failure. I moved on to the terro stuff."
1,Ant's not interested,The ant's are not attracted to this in the least. It says on the package that the product is guaranteed- but does not give any info as to what to do to return the product. Terro works much better.
2,It Works...Too Fast For Me,"I had 2 major problems with Grant's Ant Stakes:1) The ants didn't seem particularly fond of it. It's probably just the variety of ant that I have, but they don't seem to flock to it. But, the reason for that probably is...2) It killed my ants too fast. The idea is for this to get back to the colony and the queen...but the ants that got to the poison didn't make it off the counter, let alone back to the nest. It's hard to get the line going if the scouts croak before getting back home.The ants I have are very small, even for ants (about 1/16"" long), so that probably isn't helping. So, it might work for your ants, but it really isn't having an impact on mine."
1,Ants are laughing at this.,"I bought this for ants that are in my garage. They walk around it even when I put it in their path from their hole to the garbage. I also put two around their hole and they just walk around it. None even crawl over it let alone into the hole with the bait. What a waste of money. The best thing is the dimaceous earth dust, although it doesn't kill the queen."
1,"Zero stars, does not work -- do not buy this","As others have noted, the old ones worked well. The new formulation simply does not attract the ants.If I caught each little bugger and stuffed the bait down their gullets, this might work."
1,The ants laugh at my feeble efforts.,My home is overrun with ants. It's real bad. So I took the offensive. It was between Grant's or Raid at my local grocery store. I already knew Raid didn't work so I went with this. I should have just lit my cash on fire. I threw one of these directly in the middle of an ant trail. Sure the ants were crawling over it but they were completely ignoring the bait. Back to the drawing board. I'm going to hit up a hardware store where they have a much larger selection of ant death.I live in SoCal.
3,Ants-Be-Gone,"I probably had too high expectations for this product. I thought that I would open one trap and 24 hours later all ants would be dead. This was not the case, but they did eventually work within a week. Still very pleased they worked."
2,Did not work at all,"Used the product as instructed and nothing. The ants casually passed by every stake showing zero interest in it. After doing some research online, I poked inside the opening with a toothpick. That seemed to have some effect but not much. Ended upo buying another product that started working right in front of my eyes. If Grant's product doesn't work for you, try Hot Shot Liquid Ant Bait."
1,The Ants Keep Marching,"We have always used Grants Ant Stakes with quick success, but, like many of the other reviewers, we're not happy with the new formulation. The ants had found some plants in the master bathroom that they liked, so we put down a fresh stake in their path which they quickly found and liked. We've had a steady stream of them marching to the bait for at least a week! We added a second bait stake next to the first and they've been going to both of them. It's not stopping. Clearly, these guys like the new formulation, but we don't."
2,Not sure if it works.,Have several stakes around the house. Have never seen an ant go anywhere near them. I use the Terro liquid ant baits instead and they go crazy for that...
2,Competitor traps worked better for me.. :/,"I thought these would work as good as the competitive brand, but I was wrong :( We have ""piss-ants"" at our place and the ants totally avoided these. Maybe ""piss-ants"" just love the borax/sugar mix more."
1,Save Your Money,This has got to be the worst ant poison ever! Left it out where many ants were found and NONE of them went into the hole to eat the prepared poison. Too bad I opened the box or I would have taken it back to Home Depot...
1,Hasn't stopped the problem,"We've been having an ant problem since moving into our new house, so I thought i'd try this trap and see how it goes. I placed the trap by the garbage can (the garbage can is clean and emptied regularly). The ants stopped for a day or two, but started returning randomly. Yesterday I got tired of looking at them again so I traced their path back to their source. I took a trap, with some tape on the back, and placed it right in their path. I changed the garbage bag, cleaned the garbage can, and completely wiped down the counter edge. I wouldn't be upset with this product if the ants had found a new way past this trap (which again, I put DIRECTLY IN THEIR PATH) but they are walking over it and past it and continuing on to the garbage can. The counter top is cleaned almost daily because of these ants, and this product simply does not work."
1,"What a joke, save your money",I purchased these locally to kill a colony of carpenter ants. The ant's justbypass it. Buy some other product other than this. These are a waste of money!
1,Worthless!,"Waste of $8. I've got an ant problem. They started coming into the house around fall. They are the common, small black ant you've seen a million times.Put 5 of these in my kitchen. The ants completely ignored them.See pic that I uploaded which shows a swarm of ants RIGHT NEXT TO the Grants Ants stake but not on it.I left these things around the house for about three months. NO NOTICEABLE DECREASE IN ANTS. Waste of money. Now... how about that guarantee?"
4,Worked like a charm,"Been trying to get rid of different species of ants out of my kitchen for the longest time; and have tried almost everything. Grants did the job. The product seemed to not be working at first as it seems not to really attract the ants to it. However careful placement along the trail resulted in them eventually going into it, That process took about a week. Then within another week, significantly less were seen, until none.Positives about this product is that it really works 100%. And works for a really long time.Negatives are that it require proper 'in the ants path' placement as it doesn't seem to attract them at first; and also take about 2 weeks to take effect, but worth the wait.Thanks Grants Ants."
1,WORTHLESS,"Whether stakes, bait traps, gel- Grants ant products aren't worth the money. Ants ignore all of them. I used to use COMBAT ant gel every Summer- just place a drop near the ant trail, and the little pests were on that stuff in seconds. Usually the colony was gone in a day. For some reason I can't find the good stuff in stores anymore. Guess I'll have to order online. I am absolutely not wasting any more money on Grant's crap."
1,doesn't work!,I placed 1 stake on the window box outside my bay window couple of days ago. Ants are still crawling all over my bay window seat!
4,My daughter loves it!,"We got our (then 6 year old) daughter her piggy Webkinz. She's 8 now and not a week goes by that she doesn't go online to play with ""Petunia"". I love that they can go online and play and still be safe. There are chat features, but strictly controlled. The kids can only put in preselected phrases to talk with their animal friends. I wish I had these growing up :)"
5,My kids LIVE for these animals....AWESOME.,"My daughter has this pig and also the unicorn (both the big size) and also a small white poodle. My son has the little grey cat. They LIVE on the web page for these animals. It is really a kid-friendly website that is a lot of fun. I have actually gotten addicted to the came ""Cash Cow"" where you can earn KinzCash to spend on your animals. There is lots of fun here. I highly recommend them. They are nice quality animals too. My daughter also has the purse to hold one of them. Nice toys! Great website! We will probably own 15 of them before it is all over and done!"
3,pig,"Webkinz Pig a little disapointed, smaller then I thought and it didnt look like the picture. We had to buy another one."
5,Webkinz Pig,My Sister-in-law does the Webkinz thing! So it's nice I can send her FB massages to see what ones she wants!
5,Webkinz,"My daughter was heartbroken when this little piggy was no longer available at one of our local malls. I promised her we could find it on Amazon, and we did!It came in less than 5 days, and was brand new like promised.Very happy!"
5,Great for Webkinz pig fans!,"Great quality, although not the traditional furry type of stuffed animal, it's more like thread fur on this Webkinz. Never the less it's a cute little pig and my daughter enjoys him and playing with him on Webkinz."
2,This may be a recording you either love or hate.,"I bought this CD based on its one 5-star review and was very disappointed. I suppose it depends on whose recordings you're used to listening to, but after many years of hearing Moravec's Preludes, I find Ohlsson's unbearable. The slow preludes are way too slow and the fast ones sound like he's in a race to beat every other rendition. The volume is also a problem with many parts either too soft or too loud. Judging by the previous review, some listeners will like the recording - but certainly not all will. I definitely do not."
3,"Too ""bangy""","I was dissappointed that so many pieces were played with very little ""feeling"".The left hand was rough and too loud. Chopin requires deft and agile fingering with a sweep of emotion. He just banged it out!"
1,Beware!,"This book is supposed to be the MyCompLabSeries but it DOES NOT come with the online access code. I specifically bought this book because my son needed the code for online access-hence the term ""MyCompLab"". I checked for the price to buy the code separately for this specific book and the code alone was $40. I could have bought the book with the code from the college bookstore for $56 but was trying to save money since I have 2 kids in college. Please beware."
1,YUCKK,"I bought this book because I thought I needed but my professor changed his mind, I tried to return it and they wanted to CHARGE me to return it, BEWAREE YOU CAN""T RETURN IT AND FOR THAT It is in my closet doing nothing."
4,Penny Loves Kenny Bootielicious review,"These boots are bootielicious! My only criticism is they don't have much cushioning on the soles & are a little loose on me but other than that I think they're great. Quick shipping, too."
3,Slow starting motor,Great design on this unit and it will fit nicely into my plans. I enjoy the portability and compact size.However I do have a problem with my machine as it's motor will not function on a cold morning outside. I'm in Fl.! It will chug a few seconds before it pops it's circuit breaker. Repeating this drill several times it sometimes works and sometimes not. It will also blow the house circuit breakers(20a service)if you persist. Bringing it inside or putting it into a heated car cures it's starting problem. Once running it a real jewel and fairly quiet.This is a most annoying situation and it's currently in the shop. Despite the Dewalt label this is a Chinese built unit and have seen the motor/unit in other low end machines.
3,so so,"Nailer is good but the air compressor regulator broke and you can't find a direct replacement. THere is better ones out there, but it was a decent deal."
1,Poorly designed shipping configuration,"The plastic shroud surrounding the compressor motor has arrived broken on me twice, I am sending it back again. Probably a great deWalt product, but I wouldn't really know because they keep arriving damaged. By placing the plastic housing on the outside of the box with a coil of compressor cable and a sheet of cardboard to protect it. The iron compressor tank should probably be on the outside. I didn't major in packaging, and still I know this."
2,"Cheap yes, but not enough padding","$20 - I saw that price and decided to try it out. Yeah, I mean it looks like a well-made bag - the stitching and zipper and every thing are probably ok. But I just don't feel right putting my instrument in this bag. It has pretty much no padding. Buy it if you just need something to throw over your bass, but if you are worried about people and things banging into your bass while you are carrying it around, you should go for something better. I have a World Tour deluxe bag for my GT-8 Processor, and that is great bag with lots of padding (funny too b/c the GT-8 probably doesn't need it, but I also use the bag to carry my pedals when I'm not using the GT-8). So maybe the Deluxe version of this bag is good. I don't know."
3,Good enough,"This is almost more of a dust cover than anything else. Not much in the way of padding, so you can't beat it up like a high-end gig bag or hard shell case. On the other hand, the bag itself is well made (good materials, strong seams). So if you're not too rough with you gear, this bag works just great at an affordable price."
2,Not what you expect.,"Ordered bag for acoustic Bass, but bag is a very tight fit. Not much padding in bag for instrument. Zipper keeps pulling aprt with very little tension on it."
4,GBBASS padded bass guitar gig bag,A great bag for the price; I expected it to be fairly cheap given the price but am pleased with the product. Well done chaps.
1,my review,My review about this bag is sincery that is NOT what I expected. It is very simple I hope that last more than I expect now.
3,Vista users be careful with this item.,"I have been using WordPerfect since the 1980s when is was THE word processor and I still think it is a better word processor than MS Word. However.... although the box has the ready-for-Vista stamp, Corel has not done a very good job of making the software easy to install. I purchased the ""Home Edition"" which required that I visit the Corel website and download an update installer and SP2 before this edition could be used with Vista. It did some nasty things to Vista the first time around and Vista had to be restored to a checkpoint before the WordPerfect installation. All this updating, restoring, etc. was a nuisance and time consuming. The software came with a ""bundle"" of utilites which is pretty useless, in my opinion, and I did not install any of the extras."
1,Very Bias- obviously feminist (which is just fine) but way too subjective,"The first half of the book was valuable to my coursework and very informative. However, the more I read the more I began to realize how subjective the text was and its failure to be objective as possible. I believe that every human has dignity and deserves respect, but the author of this book seems to aim at identifying women as the greater sex instead of treating them equally. The text also looked at many issues from just one side, rather than looking at the issues at hand from multiple perspectives. For instance, while the book barely covered contraceptives and the benefits of sexual experience, it didn't look at the benefits of abstaining. It also seemed to take aim at the Catholic Church quite a bit. While I am not Catholic, I still find this unnecessary."
5,L-Carnosine,"Product is said to be good for the eyes, and to give energy. I was experiencing some problems reading fine print and since taking this product it is much better. My energy level is high, I used to go to bed around 7.30 - 8.00pm and now I can stay up as late as 11.00pm without feeling sluggish. Thanks to L-Carnosine, I will recommend to others."
3,Anti-aging?,"This seems to help a bit with my energy. After the first few days, I also felt as if the dark circles under my eyes were lessened, but probably only enough that I would notice. I have read enough about l-carnosine's long term health and anti-aging benefits that I plan to stick with it for now, more as a preventative than with any expectations of immediate observable benefits."
3,Beautiful but frustrating,The images on this DVD are as beautiful as advertised but other than knowing they are of National Parks going in as you watch you have no idea wich ones you are looking at. I watched this with two other people we all felt a small indication of what parks you are seeing would have made this much more enjoyable
5,This cartoon needs a dvd release,Disney needs to put MB Onto dvd. What is probably keeping them from putting MB onto dvd is all of the video clips and photos used in the cartoon. Disney is too cheap to pay money to get th copyrights so they can release this great cartoon onto dvd. BIG Mistake. They can make up they money with dvd sales. This cartoon would be a BIG hit on dvd. It was cool in 2004 when there were plush dolls with dvds but those were disappointing because there were only 4 dolls and only 1 episode per dvd. This cartoon needs to be on dvd. It would be a BIG money maker
2,Not my cup of tea...,"I just picked it up off the shelf at the library and I don't think this book was meant for me. It is about several mens' reaction to war and the disgusting men that it made them. I am not sure why I finished it. I think you need a good understanding of the Vietnam War to get some of it. I don't think that it was poorly written, but I just didn't see much of a point to the book and didn't find any real resolution. I am not sure any of the characters changed either which was odd."
4,Got what I expected,"I purchased this hard drive enclosure based solely on price. So being that I chose the cheapest one that Amazon had at the time, I wasn't expecting too much. The enclosure works as it should. I have had no compatibility issues with either my vista desktop or my XP laptop. the workmanship seams kinda cheap and there doesn't seem to be anyway to secure the hard drive while in the enclosure. One last issue was that the instructions inside the box were for the wrong product which was a little irritating but I pretty much knew what I was doing. It works and thats all that matters in the end."
3,It does the job for the price!,"We had a hard drive from a previous version of Microsoft that our latest PC would not recognise (don't know why!). It was SO simple to remove the drive, place it into the enclosure and attach to the USB of our new PC tower...and the best thing of all - a much cheaper option than having to go to BestBuy for them to ""make a copy of the hard drive"" at $99!!!!"
2,Continually Unmounts,"I bought two of these Sabrent external enclosures and both of them worked fine up until about 3 day's use. They both have the same problem, they keep unmounting from the computer. I believe the problem is due to the power plug. I have tried using them on both a Mac and multiple PC's, but I still see the same problem. I tried using different power cords and different hard drives, but the problem persists.I own an significantly older version of the Sabrent external enclosure, and it works great! Maybe I just got two lemons, but two bad cases out of two isn't a good sign.Besides the faulty enclosure information, the case is also very tight. You will need to keep the wires very tidy to fit everything in there. I already knew this before purchasing these cases because my old Sabrent is the same way. It is not much of a problem. It is just a small hinderance."
2,Need to reformat to make it work,"It is a snap to install the hard drive in the case, but to make the usb work require proper re-formatting of the hard drive. Since it does not come with fan, it can get pretty hot if used for a long time."
1,JUNK! DON'T BUY,"THIS IS NOT MY FIRST ENCLOSURE! ive done dozens of enclosures. but this one is plain junk! i hooked everything up flipped the switch,it worked for fifteen seconds till i turned it off then it never worked again! the connections are very poor,the AC connection wouldnt stay in. the workmanship cheap,not worth even a penny."
3,Build quality issue,"Certianly a good cheap and cheerfu external enclosure to let you make use of old IDE drives you might have lying around.I'm a bit concerned there was no assembly instructions. Took me a while to work out you have to slide out the plastic strips on the sides to get at the holes to secure the drive in the case. After i'd worked that out, it was very easy indeed to install.One major problem, though - went to plug in power, but the socket dropped through the plastic case. Turns out one of the two tiny screws that secure the little circuit board to the end piece was the wrong size and had slipped out. Had to put it in and secure with a blob of glue. I know this is a cheapo unit, but at least this could have been picked up at quality control."
1,Unimpressive,"I purchased two. Both were defective. On the first one, the device was not recognized by Windows. The second one worked, sort of. Windows always recognized it, but then it would flake out while accessing the drive. These problems occurred with two different drives, so it wasn't the drives, it was the enclosures.Fit is poor (OK, its cheap), and the manufacturing tolerances on the aluminum part of the case seem to vary widely. Some reviewers claim their drives don't fit (case too small), while my cases were too large, allowing too much slop. Screws held that in check, but that isn't what the screws on a drive are meant to do. Eventually they will strip out.Access on the one unit that worked was slow. There was a 7200 RPM screamer in there, but you'd never know.Others have noted the lack of ventilation and the lack of power down timers. Ditto here.Stay away. If your data is worth anything at all, then buy something you think will work. This one won't."
1,Bad product,"This product is hard to use, a piece of junk, and is not worth the 18.99 that they ask. When you connect your hard drive to it and connect it to your computer, it doesn't recognize that there is a hard drive connected to it. It would be much easer, and better in the long run to just buy the more expensive external hard drive enclosure, instead of looking to save a buck."
1,Cheap product,The power supply crashed after one day of use ... the delivery was fast though ... it's not the merchant's fault
3,Not the best!,"I admit that I got this case because it was inexpensive. But upon getting it I soon realized that it was just cheap. Yes there is a difference. The ends of the case do not want to stay on and I need to use a binder to hold the thing together. Other than that this drive has worked fine, it seems a little slow but I'm using it over a USB 1.0 port, so that is my fault. Overall I have been satisfied with this drive for the price. The fact that it does not want to stay in one piece is an inconvenience but nothing more. So it's a good drive, but I would recommend spending a little more for a nicer one."
1,USB Fail.,"An amazingly useless piece of crap. The first time I plugged the connector in, one of the prongs bent, and it never worked correctly afterward. For a month or two, I was able to obtain my data when physically holding the connector in place. Eventually, one of the prongs snapped completely off and now it is worthless. So worthless, in fact, I felt compelled to make this my first Amazon product review ever. Don't buy this."
4,Great tool!,I've recovered quite a bit of data from laptop hard drives using this. I also always have a portable hard drive laying around somewhere now.
2,eh ... it's ok,"Overall I would recommend a different brand enclosure. Had to read reviews here to get it up and going (needed to switch off the included usb cable). I had a storm with a power outage and the firmware quit working. 1 day after my 30 day return window with Amazon. Tried contacting Sabrent support and received a very generic response to my questions. If anyone figures out how to correct a Cypress AT2LP RC58 error, let me know!"
5,worth the wait and twice the price,"The product is sturdy easy to install. I use it for multiple hard drives I have lying around. Notable: comes with baby phillips screwdriver and was just instantaneous to set up. I did have to wait for it but only a few days compared to what it said on the screen. I bought another model that was more money but available now and it is a royal pain in the you know what to work with. This unit, however, was worth the wait and twice the price."
4,"Definately worth it, for the price","The price may be cheap on this, but it gets the job done. I had my motherboard go out on my computer, and needed a way to get all the stuff I had saved on my hard drive. Bought one of these, and now I have a portable hard drive. Easy to get started. I changed my drive to slave mode, plugged it in, and I was good to go (I have Windows Vista).As I said, this is perfect for a cheap solution for having your own external hard drive."
4,so far so good,"don't really like the desktop adapter, or the white ""3.5"" USB2.0 HARD DRIVE ENCLOSURE"" lettering and usb 2.0 logo on BOTH sides. however, those are pretty minor. most importantly, it's cheap and it works."
4,good deal,The goodVERY easy to use.Looks good.The badNo cooling fan or vents.My unit did not come with the inner sleeve.So I have no way to mount the drive.I bought this to recover data from crashed computers.I've only used it once and I just pluged in thecables and laid the drive on the table.For the price it's a good deal.
4,Nice Product. Easy to assemble.,It took me all of 3 minutes to put this unit together. I can't see how others were having such issues with assembling them. I don't have little hands or anything odd that gave me any advantage. Yes the plastic end is a little cheap but look at the cost of it. This case disapates the heat very well. I wouldn't suggest using this as a mobile unit because I don't think it can handle that kind of abuse. Since that was not the type of enclosure I was looking for this enclosure fit the bill perfectly. I have two other enclosures from Sabrent for 2.5 drives and they work great. Gotta say I am getting the most bang for my buck with them.
1,Buyer Beware!,"I would have given this product zero star if I could. I've been using couple Sabrent ECS-U35K for couple months now without any problem until last week. I had both enclosures plugged into the same power strip. Had both of them turned on and running when I hear a loud pop! then both LED started flashing follow by and really strong odor. I shut both of them off immediately, but it was already too late.To make a long story short, Two dead hard drives and one dead enclosure. I've lost so much on the two hard drives that I will never use another Sabrent enclosure again. E-mail Sabrent tech support with no response. You know what you have to lose if this cheap enclosure kill your hard drive. Buy and use at your own risk!"
1,Garbage... Beware!,"Well, I just assembled this drive about ten minutes ago. I then plugged it up, and Vista recognized it immediately. Before I knew it, I was browsing all those files that I thought I had lost. I was elated! I thought to myself, ""For only $18.99, I have recovered my data..."" That thought was short-lived, since the drive came to a crashing halt just moments later. I don't know if I'll ever forget that ""pop"" and power down. I'm imagining that the data is all gone now, and, considering that it is five years' worth of data, I'll be beside myself if it is. I'm going to buy another 3.5"" IDE to USB conversion kit to find out--you better believe that it will not be one from Sabrent!"
1,Not a good choice,I figured getting a cheap case would not be a problem but that was a mistake. I tried a 500gb and a 120gb drive with the case. They both work fine with another case that I own. They were both set to master and the drive light flashed green but neither drive would appear on either of my XP machines. I tried every other jumper setting to no avail. The front of the case is flimsy but I wasn't planning on moving it around a lot so that would have been irrelevant. The drive activity light is mounted on the same side as the cable connectors. Finally the cord from the case to the power supply is short so if the drive is on a desk the power supply dangles. Basically you have a weight hanging from the drive which will make it easy to pull off the desk when hit. I just sent it back.
2,Sabrent External Oven,This product does allow you to put an internal iide Hardrive into it but it has no cooling features (as in no cooling holes) Hardrive get really really hot in this enclosure. It is cheap but don't be this cheap!
3,It may or may not work,"I have four hard drives, and wanted to protect them against dust and accidental crashes, so I bought two of this enclosure. I armed and installed the first one, and it was a success, it works as expected; but the second one did ot work at all. You can hear that the hard drive powers on, and the green led tells you that, but there is no communication at all."
2,cheep,"this product is the worst made enclosure i have seen. it doesnt go together right, the screws are to short, but for the price i guess what can u expect; at least it works."
4,Happy Happy,Works Great no problems other than putting it together factory a bit sloppy but I worked it out.
2,USB,"I spent several hours trying to get this product to work and kept getting error saying ""unknown USB device"". I tried using this product on multiple computers and always got the same error message. Right before packing it up for return I tried using a different USB cord and this solved the problem. Luckily I had an extra USB cord other wise I would never had solved this problem. The USB cord was completely defective!!!"
1,Poorly made piece of junk.,"This enclosure is poorly made, drives don't fit well so they slide around, the connections are poor, the cables are too short, the top doesn't fit properly and has to be taped down, and before long, it won't even turn on. Pure garbage. I have to imagine that pretty much any other enclosure would be better but from now on, I'm sticking with externals for my back-ups."
1,JUNK,"Sabrent ECS-U35K Ultra Slim USB 2.0 3.5-inch IDE/PATA Hard Drive Enclosure (Black)cables very short to the extent not serviceable. i have FIVE EXTERNAL DRIVE ENCLOSURE, THIS IS THE ONLY ONE I HAVE PURCHASED THAT DID NOT WORK. PURE JUNK."
4,"Cheap, but it works.","The item was what I expected and after reading the reviews from other buyers, I had no problems. The instructions that come with the unit are alright, but the HD must be set as Single and not Master as instructed. Everything screwed together fine and XP recognized it with no problems. I leave it plugged in and when I turn it on, XP recognizes that something has been plugged into the USB port. I click on the safely remove hardware icon and when it says that it's OK; I turn it off."
3,Works But Handle With Care,"The first one I bought was defective -- the internal ribbon connecting cable had a tear in it. The replacement works fine but the power outlet didn't line up with the hole where the cord goes. And when I gave the cord a little extra push the connector snapped (of course). The unit still powers up but the connector is loose. Aside from that my PC detected it automatically with no problem. So it does what it's supposed to do, it's just not very rugged (despite the metal case). I wouldn't advise taking it on the road -- just stick a drive into it (carefully!) plug it into your desktop PC and don't mess with it."
4,"Inexpensive, durable, reliable","My laptop harddrive recently died, about 6 months before my PhD Dissertation Defense. Luckily I had time to back the computer up onto about 20 CD's (it was a chore). I learned about enclosures then, when a friend let me borrow his to access my old harddrive and recover anything that I possibly missed. So I bought the enclosure in this review and drag and drop my whole hard drive on it about twice a week. This enclosue is fast, I've never had any problems with reliability, it holds a large harddrive which is relativly cheap per megabyte compared with a laptop hardrive. Finally I like this one because it has a metal case."
5,Great buy for the money.,"I got mine a few day's ago and to be honest I wish it had a status light on the front, but really I can't complain. It's a great unit. Installation time took less then 2 minuets.If you have the slightest technical ability you can assemble this product and get it working. The The ribbon cable and power wires went in easily with a simple fold in them and fairly easily.It comes with all the required parts to assemble and looks rather snazzy on my desk. Actually I'm thinking of mounting them inside my case and picking up a few more of these units. (I have a 4 port usb pci card that has the ports inside my case)."
1,This Product is under Recall for power supply,Item worked for all of about 5 minutes. My new iMac would not recognize the hard drive through this item. After doing some research it turns out there was a recall on this product because of a faulty power supply. Amazon was great in allowing us to return the product. This review is only a knock against the product and not Amazon. Their return policy was smooth with no hassles.
1,does not fit a 5.25 drive,"The item title is wrong, plain and simple. It is not large enough to accomodate a 5.25 inch drive. If I wanted a 3.5 inch drive enclosure I could have gone to any big box electronics store. Very disspointed!"
1,Junk - don't buy,"Fell apart when I unboxed it. Circuit board was not attached, making it almost impossible to use. Not worth the hassle to return. Went to Frys and got a better one for the same price."
1,Broken!,"Broken upon receipt. The circuit board was not attached to the front panel and the screws don't fit. I tried to attach the circuit board back into place but I couldn't and decided rather than to try and glue it together and possibly ruin it, to just return it."
2,It broke right out of the box,"So, I got this item and when installing my HD, there are small screws that attach the female usb to the casing, these screws screw into a tiny plastic plate which broke the day I got it. What a bad move on Sabrent! That said, I have had the enclosure for one year now and it is working ok, even though the back of the case hangs with wires and small circuit board well exposed. I would not buy this item again because of it's cheap build quality. Also, the usb cable seems to fall out too often. I almost never move it, so why would it fall out anyway? I really would buy something else for this price. Think about it..."
3,Easy to use but power supply is a problem,"This enclosure was extremely easy to set up and transferring files was a snap. However, the power supply failed on day two and I had to return the unit for a new one. I received the new unit and power supply and everything seems to be working well."
4,Save that old hard drive,"I got a new computer w/Windows Vista and it didn't support IDE-type hard drives. I had a 250 Gb IDE secondary drive in my old system and didn't want to have to transfer all the data to the new machine, and not be able to re-use the drive. I tried using a conversion cable (SATA to IDE) but couldn't get that to work. The Sabrent enclosure was just what I needed. Setup was just a matter of putting the drive in the box, attaching the drive to the internal cable, plugging the enclosure into a USB port, and powering things up. It worked right away, and the transfer speeds with the USB2 port are plenty fast since the drive is mostly used for backing up MP3 files and photos. I like the fact that the enclosure has its own power switch."
4,Met my requirements,"I have two old IDE hard disks with lot of information from my previous machine. Got a new machine but it was not IDE compatible, so I bought this device from Amazon (free delivery). I am happy so far, it attends my requirements, it was pretty easy to mount and put HD in device, no need to use the small CD, windows XP (laptop) and vista (desktop) recognized on first connection. I am avoiding to leave this device turned on for long periods, but I forgot to turn off one night and it was not too hot next morning, so heat does not seem to be a problem. As long as you follow the short installation instructions, you should be fine.Product picture has only comestic difference in the device base, but its nothing to worry about.Only problem is that I would need to buy two devices to avoid switching/installing HDs each time I need one of them. :P"
2,"Works, but could be much better","One of the threaded inserts (in one of the two enclosures I bought) wasn't threaded, so I could only put one screw in to hold the front plate to the enclosure. The instructions didn't say that the screw holes to mount the drive were covered by a slide-in extruded plastic strip, so it took me awhile to find how to fasten it in. During the several hours of formatting, the case got really hot--almost too hot to touch; but, this shouldn't be a problem in my application since it won't be powered except when I'm adding files. All in all, a pretty poor design & implementation--but, it was cheap & it does work."
1,Couldn't get it working,"I spent about an hour experimenting with the enclosure, different computers and operating systems, various hard drives, etc. with no luck. The green light would come on, and occasionally the computer would recognize that a USB device was attached, but I would never get a drive letter.The documentation is mercifully short but unhelpful."
4,A side of James Taylor I had not seen before,"I thoroughly enjoy this DVD and highly recommend it. Admittedly, this is the first James Taylor DVD I had ever seen and have never seen him in person before. That being said the performance is what you would expect AND he is quite open and entertaining in the introductions leading up to the songs which I found illuminating. A peek into a side of him I had never seen before."
5,Fantastic sandals,"However, you need to be careful when choosing the size as they are made in China. The pair I got is slightly smaller than expected."
2,Basic Portuguese,"I was disappointed in this book because it isn't nearly as comprehensive as the ""Basic...for travelers"" books I purchased earlier for German, French, Spanish and Italian. For example, nowhere in this book is there a word for bathroom, restroom, etc. And I think it's pretty important to know how to ask that question in a foreign land!!"
3,"TIght fit, but works well when you find the driver.","The cable fits really tight, almost like pins will bend if you keep forcing it in.One problem was the disc that came with didn't have the driver for AX8600, had to dig for it on the web."
1,Not for the LG Chocolate,This USB cable is NOT for the LG Choc or the enV2...the end that should plug into the phone is the wrong size!!!
3,Usb data cable,I was all over happy with the product except I am unable to use the product because the software does not work. :(
3,Light Duty Jobs only,"I purchased this for the intent of indoor and outdoor uses. It works great for labeling metal tool drawers, but doesn't have a strong enough magnet for heavier jobs. Also the laminate doesn't withstand nature. I had it outside for 3 days to label dock doors and the front laminate pealed from the back. In short it is recommended for light jobs and nothing more."
3,The wall plug is buggy but the base is good,Im using a different charger to plug into it because the little wall plug was unreliable but with the different charger this base works great.
5,Excelente,"EXCELENTE TranscripcionLa verdad, Para mi ESTE es el Mejor Album de Dream Theatery tenerlo en libro es lo mejor que he tenidoSe los recomiendo mucho, esta muy completo no le falta nadaSolo practicar y practicar hasta que salga la Magia :DMaRtYnMTY-MEX"
3,"Simmers, should have boiled","Not having read the first installment in Mr. Grover's series, I found the going a bit rough in the beginning, not knowing much about the characters. I'm also not a big fan of the ""techno-thriller,"" but found this one to be fairly easy to follow. Sadly, where it falls apart is where it shouldn't, namely the big climax. Disarming a nuclear warhead in a page-and-a-half without the hero breaking a sweat? I don't think so. There are also a couple of plot twists alluded to early on, but never delivered. Not bad overall, but maybe the next one will be better."
1,Could Have Been So Much Better,"I didn't read the first book in this series, and I would advise anyone who plans to read this book to start with the first one. I give this 1 star because there are too many distractors. It has the makings of a good technothriller, but lacks character development, leaves questions unanswered, the writing goes from pretty good to pretty awful, and the grammatical mistakes and lack of a good editor are glaring."
2,aqua mix eff ex,I tried this today with no luck.It didn't even lighten the efforescense at all.I even tried it again with same result.DON;T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON IT I really don't think any thing can get rid of it.
5,Very Good,I have always love ritz and can have them now and then. The one thing I hate the product is very expensive.
1,Not As Good As Before,"The new Ritz is not the cracker of old. Poorer taste, and so crumbly you'll be lucky to find anything but crumbs when you open the box. And forget putting peanut butter or soft cheese on the cracker, you'll break/crumble the cracker trying that."
1,Where's the fat?,"Like so many products these days the new recipes are not like the old. Due to the removal of trans fats the bakery products have taken a hit and Ritz crackers was one of them. The crackers can't seem to hold together. Try to spread anything on them and they fall apart. The taste is off and not like I remember and I am no the only person who feels this way. Shortening filled the bill when it came to many bakery products. And the new replacements can't fill the bill. These crackers were so bad the only thing they were good for was feeding the crows. I would give this product zero stars, but since it fed the crows I will give it one."
4,"Lots of fun, Exactly what you'd expect","It's bluegrass Metallica, Fun, upbeat, a little silly. No drums, so some of the original songs (One) are almost unrecognizable, but still fun. Great interpretations of the other songs, Unforgiven, Ride the Lightning are GREAT as bluegrass."
2,Vocals,This album would have been great as a pure instrumental but the vocals ruined it for me. I have nothing against vocals I just wish the they didn't exist in this particular album. The instruments sound great but I opted for the Celtic Tribute to Metallica. There are no vocals in the Celtic Tribute to Metallica.
2,Not as good as the AC/DC Bluegrass tribute,"They SING in this one..... (horribly, I must say) ......I LOVED the AC/DC Bluegrass Tribute so much I came back for the Metallica version.....I listed to the first minute of each song...then skipped to the next...and haven't played it again since....I personally thought it was awful...but looks like others liked it based on the below reviews....so if you can handle the bad singing the whole way through each song....you might like it!"
1,Bluegrass bullets to the band,"I am a big fan of Metallica, and I know that if you are doing a tribute album you should at least honor their music. In the case of Fade to Bluegrass, its more like bullets to the bands' dignity. Songs like ""Enter Sandman,"" will go down in history. But a bluegrass version of it? It sounds silly and ridiculous. If you enjoy Metallica, you will definetly hate this album. This only gets 1 star, because there wasn't a .5 or -5 option available. This review has been brought to you by Kris10. Email me at WwKris10wW@aol.com"
1,What Was Metallica Thinking,"This has to be the worst thing ever to happen in music history. I can not think of anything worse then turning perfectly good music into bluegrass. Why would Metallica let this happen? I hope that they are not that driven by the power of making money to sell their heavy metal soul. Wait a minute, I do hope they were driven by money, because any other reason would not be acceptable or believable. To hear the music of Metallica in bluegrass form is like having someone running their fingernails down a blackboard, Michael Bolton doing anything dealing with music, and a knife and fork being scratch on a china plate all at the same time. Why Metallica? WHY?"
3,Surprisingly good match,"I'm a bluegrass fan and an old Metallica fan. When I first heard tracks from this album, I was surprised at how well the bluegrass sound fit Metallica so I bought the album. The album is quite good with one exception -- there aren't any fiddles. There's nothing like a long, drawn-out violin note to evoke the same raw emotion that is Metallica."
1,Trash,Who thought it would be a good idea to make this CD? This is absolutely dreadful. This is an insult to Metallica and all the fans of Metallica. I can't believe how butchered these songs are on this CD. I would recommend to anyone who is considering buying this CD to not waste their money.
3,Pioneer cookbook,"It's an ok little book, nothing special. If you have interests in thistype of cooking, you may like it."
3,"Okay, but with problems","This is easy to use and does not smell like polish (also dries fast), but it does get sort of cloudy looking on your nails and chips off unattractively."
5,Hooked in one application!,"I found this product yesterday and used it and was instantly hooked. Not only did my nails look and feel natural (I got the buffed sheen), they also felt instantly strong, without smell or smudges. This is the best product I've found in 2006."
5,Fantastic read...,"about a murderer who pretends to be a journalist (Finkel) while being on the run in Mexico. Finkel contacts Longo when he is returned to the U.S. and put in jail, and correspondance and phone calls flow from there.Both Finkel (the writer) and Longo (the murderer) have personality disorders, in this reviewer's opinion. Finkel tends to be unrepentant about his faults and blames others for his shortcomings, as does Longo.What bothers me is that there does not seem to be a motive for what Finkel did (falsify a story) or Longo did (murder his family). A horribly true story but fascinating."
5,Best Book for 2010 for Me.,"This book was amazing. I wish I could elaborate more but I'm still trying to find some resolve with the actual story. As an average reader, I typically read 45 minutes before I go to sleep at night. This book arrived yesterday afternoon from Amazon.com. As I began to eat dinner, I peered into the book and just began reading the first chapter. I read the book in-full until 5 am this morning. I could not put the book down for nothing. I have never read a book with so much interest and sincere concern for both the author and the subjects in this book. I would HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone."
2,Disappointed,"I thought ""True Story"" was ponderous ,egoitistic and much too long.The philosophical musings were poor."
2,I thought this book was about the Christian Longo murders,Apparently no one cared to hear Michael Finkel's excuses for his fraudulent story in the NY Times and therefore he decided to slip it into a a horrendous murder story that would catch peoples attention. I was expecting to read the true story of the Christian Longo murders not whining from Michael Finkel over his firing. I did not learn of anything about Christian Longo or his trial that wasn't already covered in the newscasts on TV from this book. I still don't think Mr. Finkel gets it! Readers don't like having the wool pulled over their eyes!
3,"Great Read, but Some Tasteless Content","Very captivating. Would have given 5 stars, but author included some swear words and some sexually graphic content that was not necessary."
4,A quiet surprise,"John is HIV+, and with the new drug cocktails and his new workout regiment, he's finding himself with a hot new look and attitude toward life. He and his boyfriend having a falling out, and John unleashes himself into the party culture. His boyfriend realizes he still wants John, and begins to change his own behavior in the hopes of getting John back. I didn't expect much from this romance novel, but I was pleasantly surprised to find how intelligent the commentary on gay culture is. Outland's book is a joyful, smart, fun read."
1,Save your money. Return this book to the shelf.,"I was really disappointed with this novel. The characters were paper thin and the dialogue was so unrealistic, tedious and boring. The author spent a whole page having two characters discuss the ingredients of those GNC supplements. How boring. The plot was uneven but at the same time predictable. I won't pick up another Outland novel. I was half way through this book before I realized I had read one of the authors murder mysteries which was just as disjointed as this novel."
1,Worst book I have read in a long time,"This book was terrible. I am glad I checked it out from the library. I knew it was bad when I had finished half of the book and skipped to the end, realized that it wasn't going anywhere and returned it. The writing is horrible. The characters were flat, and very uninteresting. The plot was contrived and to be honest I really didn't care what happened to the main character. (Well, I was hoping for a grisly accident, a shooting from a jealous ex-lover, ANYTHING that might make the book exciting. Alas, that was not to be. It seemed like he made some of the characters historians, but they acted in stereotypical manner and didn't seem to know all that much about history. A little research and character development goes along way."
3,A good book to spend an afternoon with.,"Okay, so it's not literature, but it did keep me turning the pages and it was better than some gay novels I've recently read. I'd read his next one."
1,"Oh, Yeah!","The title says it all -- this author is out to get your money. If you don't like that...well, you know the rest, honey. I agree with the previous reviewer who rated this 1-star, and for all the right reasons. This book is a phenomenally negative and juvenile work, certainly not worth the time for people who read books. There is too much ""been there, done that"" about this book, and not enough plot for more than a short story. Save your money."
3,OUTLAND KNOWS THE LAY OF THE LAND IN SF,"Mr Outland certainly understands his home city of San Francisco...the street cruising, the looks based culture, the drug culture. The transformation of the main character from 'invisible boy' to 'sought after stud' is completely believable. He totally shows you how looks and body are the entrance ticket to the 'fast lane' of gay society in SF but how dangerous driving in the fast lane can be. I recommend this book to anyone who wants an insight into urban gay life in the 90s in SF (or any other city)."
5,Love it!,"I love this high chair cover! It folds up nice and small for easy travel and sets up in seconds. You have enough to carry around, this is small enough to fit in your diaper bag. This will be one of the must haves that I will purchase for a baby shower gift."
4,Okay until kids figure it out,"I used this all the time when I first got it b/c the restaurant chairs are just not clean. It was great until my kids (I have two) figured out that if they pull on the edges they can get it off the highchair, bunch it in their laps, and now make a bigger mess. Now, I just wipe down the parts of the highchairs they can reach with an antibacterial wipe. I would recommend this for smaller kids or maybe older ones who understand they shouldn't try to remove it. One great perk is that you can change how you use the straps to make a seat belt since the ones that come on the highchairs are almost always broke."
4,looking for something really different ?,"Corvus Corax may be the band for you . For this release , they teamed up to perform live with a orchestra , so it's not the typical cd for them either . Basically they wrote their own version of music based of the Carmina Burana ( not the Orff piece ) . And this it played live . The one not so great things about this recording would be the placement of the microphones . Some of the playing is totally unheard due to it being drown out by other instruments . Even though this is a problem , I'd still recommend giving it a listen . I like Corvus Corax's other releases better then this one , but they are hard to find in the USA for the most part . A simple explanation of the music would be it's very heavy on drums & bag pipes with a Renn Faire feel to it ."
5,The Divine Kay,"This was a book I eagerly anticipated and I was not let down. Entertaining show biz author Eve Golden weaves a fun story around show business's most glamorous comedienne. From day one, Kay Kendall lived a fast-paced, fun-filled life, mixed with a semi-successful career filled with interesting and witty friends.As the world knows, Kay Kendall's life was cut short following a losing battle with leukemia, a disease everyone swears she never knew she had. Her marriage to Rex Harrison is honestly told and the author manages to bring Kay's story to print in a slender volume that is filled with reminiscences from family and friends.A fun read, a delightful tribute to the Divine Kay."
3,Nice but missing some features,"I have had this for a couple years now.PROSeasy to installgreat interfacegreat pictureCONSdoes not have a TV out so you can use your TV as a montiorYou can set a time to record (so you can use your pc like a tivothe screen captures and video captures even with the settings at the highest possible could be a little betterIn conclusion i thought this would be the coolest thing but i really don't use it that much, its nice for watching tv at your pc when there is not one around and has a nice channel surfing option that gives you a thumbnail of each channel, but if you want to capture a picture or video it will have to be pretty small if you want a good resolution. Even for the web you need small pictures like 320 x 320"
3,received defective dvd--TWICE!!!,"I purchased from Amazon and loved the video itself, the concert, the music videos, the behind the scenes footage; BUT towards the end of the concert (can't remember the track number)with only like 4 songs left, the video stops playing. It just stops, doesn't move, and you can't get to the last songs of the concert. Amazon was very good about exchanging it for another, but it did the same exact thing. I ended up keeping the video just because I love the rest of it so much. I found the last 4 concert tracks on youtube so that helps. hopefully the problem has been corrected, but just beware because I made my purchase not long ago."
4,He recommends,"I bought this product at the request of another person. But I can say That the delivery was on time, he bought because he liked the price and I think he liked the product"
3,watch the region codes,"Amazon says it is NTSC for all regions, but the description of the disc says it is PAL region o. be careful. But as usual WESTLIFE delivers an amazing show. These men are spectacular to watch."
4,Works great -- but wire it to the cage,"This feeder works great. I like the steel mesh design in the bottom, which allows the fines/powder drop through (as opposed to collecting in the bottom of the feed trough).. We found the we had to use extra tie wires to hold it securely to the cage wall -- otherwise our rabbit would grab the feeder with its teeth and shake the built-in cage clips loose."
1,No top so rain ruins the food,"The bigger models of this unit have tops; this one has no top, so the rain ruins the feed unless you make your own top. Bad idea."
4,Don't put off reading this one,"I finally finished this book after putting it off several times, and I'm a terrible procrastinator. I think it is helpful to learn why we procrastinate in order to understand these behaviors and then change them. I recognized myself in so many of the sample situations desribed and the explanations behind such actions.The second part contains a lot of helpful techniques, such as breaking a big project into more manageable chunks, or deciding to work on one chapter of a book at a time that needs to be finished.I really have to reread the second part though (What to Do About [Procrastination]) because I unfortunately haven't changed my habits yet. (In fact, I should be working right now but I'm writing this review.) So until then I can't really say if it helps or not, but Part one was eye opening to me. I also appreciate that the book was written by two die-hard procrastinators who were able to overcome the habit."
4,Investing for life,"I believe the most valuable contribution by Diana Newman is the Endowment Action Plan. It is critical that the organization -- board, staff, advisors -- agree that endowment-building is an invaluable step in capacity-building and sustainability. This means that there is buy-in across the organization for a program focused on deferred gifts; in my experience this is not easy to accomplish because it means spending money and time on ""something"" that won't be immediately apparent on the annual bottom line.Newman goes on to offer many ideas about prospects, plans and marketing and provides appendices with great tools. This book would be a wonderful investment for your organization in building a great future."
5,For all farm girls in the Midwest (and everywhere),"This book has cute patterns with lots of illustrations in color. If you like applique with a farmlandtheme, this book is for you. The patterns range from simple to advanced, from potholders toa 38"" by 53"" wall hanging featured on the cover. The style is whimsical and fun. I'm a transplantedcity girl, and I love everything in the book."
4,Captures an Era,"Klingaman lucidly describes the various political and cultural plots in different parts of the world and how actions in one place have ramifications elsewhere. The personalities of the newsmakers of the era are covered including two who were starting their rise to power during the period, Benito Mussolini and Adlof Hitler. Interpersonal communication between the ""big four"", (Lloyd George, Vittorio Orlando, Georges Clenmenceau, and Woodrow Wilson) is included. Klingaman includes in his overview, stories of aviators Harry Hawker and MacKenzie Grieve, who tried to make the first nonstop Atlantic crossing. In terms of popular culture he looks at the career of Charlie Chaplin. On the sports front he describes the infamous Chicago Black Sox matter. Generally speaking this book effectively captures a broad sweep of what was happening in 1919."
4,Red Cross Sailing Book,One of the best basic sailing training books I've ever used. It's good for the basics. Teaches sailing basics in an understandable mannor. Good for people age 9 to 90.
2,Weights didn't hold up against the wind,"I think the concept is good, but the tablecloth blew off the table with some of the weights still attached and some of the weights fell off and were on the ground. I purposely bought 2 packages to increase the weight amount but it didn't keep it down well enough. Not good for a windy day and I think that's what the purpose should be for."
3,Cute table weights!,"I happened to receive the lemon variety of these table cloth weights. I bought these for a 4th of July party thinking that they would be perfect. I however underestimated the monsoon winds that we have here in AZ. I wish that I had bought clamps instead of weights, but that it only because crazy winds that come out of no where can keep any table cloth down. Now if it was only a small breeze type of day I think that it would have been fine. In retrospect, I forgot that I don't live in the mid-west anymore and thought that these would be perfect for any weather. Anyway, the actual weights have some weight to them and clamp on the tablecloth nicely and would have been a hit had there not been the crazy winds."
3,When you are in the mood for it...,"Disaster Films Collector Set is one of those must haves for the days when it's snowing sideways on Saturday morning and you just want to grab your hot chocolate, stay in your pj's and watch a good old disaster flick. Don't expect a likeness to the higher budget movies from this genre, but all in all it is good entertainment."
2,I Only Say This to be Honest,"Would that it were true that family relationships came down to the words we use when we talk to one another. Tannen tries to wrestle complex family dynamics into conversational styles, and fails dismally. Much of the ""insights"" are superficial, suggestions for improving relationships minimal, and the examples provided are tedious and boring. I had high hopes for this book but it provided little that was useful to me."
5,Fabulous new insights to relationships of all kinds,"Chapter 1 of Tannen's latest book provides some fabulous new insights to relationships of all kinds. Her discussions of the connection-control schema and meta-messages concept allow the reader to gain new perspectives on those sometimes frustrating interactions with loved ones (or coworkers, or strangers...). The rest of the book is really just ""gravy"" on top of the information in Chapter 1. Wow, I loved this book-- a definite recommendation to anyone interested in better understanding relationship communication (I see my mother's ""advice,"" formerly a source of frustration/anger, in a whole new light!)."
2,It will sure make your forearms get tired,"I am so tired after finishing this game this is what I found hard about it:1. Fighting- it is a fighting game, but boy do the computer have some cheats and can get you frustrated. This unique fighting system of just smashing buttons gives you the cramps and blocking does not exist, its more like dodging and believe me you get hit a lot but your enemies can block.2. Graphics/music- really good but if the game is so frustrating what does it matters?3. Storyline- Its allright, you got to complete a series of missions4. Over all Fun Factor- you only get one to amax of three points to built your character fighting power and defense, it takes long, the missions can be frustrating and at the end it seems like no matter how tought you built your character it still sucks...Golem can be very dificult. If you find getting your finger and forearms tired then you will find this fun."
4,Great looking game,"Urban Reign is sort of a combination of Power Stone and Kunio and Mac with some character customization thrown in between levels. It is set on the streets, and you fight gang member after gang member in various stages with different objectives. Some are timed, some have enemies just there to distract you from the real target, and most have interactive environments where objects can be picked up and used in battle. The graphics are smooth looking, the controls are decent, and the music fits the mood of the game. Between levels, you may increase different abilities of your character with experience points. There are no real special abilities or anything; this is not a science fiction themed game, just straight up street fighting."
3,"Do not buy the Kindle version! Well, maybe.","As a text, the content is solid and backed by empirical research. However, the Kindle eBook does not display the graphics which, are an integral part of understanding the material. Save yourself from frustration. Buy the paper copy!Ok. Update to my review. I had been reading the ebook on the Cloud reader and had issues with the graphics not displaying. Tech support suggested that I re-download the book. So, I downloaded the Kindle for PC app and sent the book to my PC. All the graphics appear normally and the hyperlinks function. I will change to rating to three stars. I am not giving this book four stars because there are still spelling errors and formatting issues.Best of luck!H."
1,"Military form, difficult reading, originally written in 1947",This book has been assigned as a textbook and it is one of the top 3 on my list of awful books in my lifetime of reading. It is full of errors and written with a dryness only a military procedure can match. It reads like a procedure to support systems training... another military wonder... and I bet this text was once used in training soldiers to become instructional designers. I cannot recommend this book to anyone in the modern world. The book was written in 1947 contrary to the recent publishing date.
3,Good karaoke cd,"I have to say that I expected more from this cd. I ordered it from B&N and received it like a week or two later. I sang the songs as soon as I got home and i just expected it to be better. I thought ""WOIW THIS IS GONNA BE A GR8 KARAOKE CD CUZ ITS RASCAL FLATTS!"" but it was good, not great. but ive only sang the songs like twice through so mayb it will be gr8 with my friends even though they think that rascal flatts suck and nelly and d4l rock. Ya, it said ""Here's to You"" would be on there and ""Skin"" was on there, but i like skin so I was fine with that............worth the money just be careful...dont expect high standards......"
1,Software issue with HP C5280,"I received this printer on March 10 and from the beginning have been unable to open the HP Solution Center. Initially I received some help from HP customer support, but for almost 3 weeks now I have just gotten promises that the issue would be sent to the Advance Support Group and repeats of the advice already provided. I am happy with the printing I have done, but overall am extremely disappointed with customer support and am not willing to keep the printer if I can't access the software."
2,"Good, until it spreads ink, instead of printing.","We purchased this printer in January, 2008 from Amazon. We wanted a printer for one of the execs, that printed and scanned documents quickly. It has been working great for the money, until this week (May 19, 2008). All of a sudden, when we print a document, it would just spread ink onto the paper, instead of printing. We have only used HP ink cartriges, and we tried cleaning and deep cleaning with the HP Tool box. We even talked with the HP online support for an hour. They couldn't suggest a solution to the problem, either. So now it is a piece of junk, and I am shopping for a new printer."
4,"Fantastic scanning, okay printing","I bought this printer because I needed to have good scanning quality and not so much print quality. The scans are fantastic! However, the regular printing is not very clean. It does print color photos much better than I expected though. I've only had this for a bit over a month so I haven't tried out all its features yet. It seems to eat ink but I don't have to pay for ink (company reimbursed) so I'm not concerned about that so much. It was very easy to set up and I've had no troubles using it. Just turn it on and go--only takes a few seconds to warm up. All in all, I'd recommend it for a decent all-in-one in this price range. But if clean sharp document printing is your priority, I'd go with a laser printer."
1,Don't waste your money,"I've had this printer for a little over a month. Today was the SECOND time that I've spent well over an hour on the phone with customer support. To make things worse, the man was so hard to understand that it took 15 minutes just to get my personal information inputed! By far the WORST printer I have ever bought. Constantly jamming. Not worth the trouble for AVERAGE print quality. Buyer beware!!!"
1,Trash,"HP was always my favourite printer brand name...no more. I bought the 5280 because I liked the dvd/cd printer feature. The installation of the software took forever, my computer is mildly slow by todays standards and it took over 45 minutes to finish. I set everything up properly and the only thing that worked was the photo scan and print. The printer will not print anything i send it, it won't make copies or print dvd's. It sux. And on top of all that it keeps popping up error messages that according to the tech support, which sux too, says that there is something wrong with the power supply. Returning this junk tomorrow."
1,Uselless with a Mac,"Don't buy this printer if you own a Mac. It's a nightmare to get it going.HP clearly put more effort in getting a commercial for their products on the display than making it work.As the other reviewers say, the quality of HP printers isn't that good anymore...I will never buy a HP product again... Big dissapointment!"
1,Don't even know why it stopped working properly,"At first we loved this printer, it was fast and quiet and the printouts were aok.Then at some point, when you would try to print, the printer would make a loudmetallic chattering sound. Deafening if your were sitting next to it.We believe that the problem was related to the CD printer compartment.As my child was the primary user of this printer, that was unacceptable.I ended up purchasing an HP Protosmart Premium, and we have been VERY happy withthat printer.All things told, I wish I had been able to wait for the HP Protosmart Premium instead of thisprinter."
3,Not thrilled with this item,"I've never had a bad thing to say about HP printers; they've always been reliable and long lived. I've had the 660, 697, 5150, Photosmart P1000 to date. I love my Photosmart P1000, but it occasionally acts up, which it's entitled to, considering I've had it for years, but the 4x6 tray feed doesn't work well. I had the opportunity to get the C5280 for a great price so I jumped on it.PROS:-Setup was painless.-Documents look fine.-Photos look fantastic.-Great price ($70).CONS:-When I hit print, it tells me there's a paper jam, each & every time. Hit OK and print resumes.-Very loud just trying to get the paper fed.-Takes longer to get that paper fed too.-Tried to print on a printable CD; printed over the hole, so information was missing. Might just be me though; I have never done that before. I have no intentions of ever printing onto a CD so this option I can do without.I can live with the minor inconveniences, until something better comes my way..."
1,Buyer Beware,This printer worked for about 2 months. I have been sent 2 replacement units with the same problem. I have spent over 5 hours on the phone with tech support.The photos have lines across the entire picture. I have even been told by tech support that this model has many problems & that they would send me a different model. Surprise when I got the replacement it was the same useless model. Do not buy this printer unless you do not need to print photos.
4,Great Printer For The Money,I own this printer now and couldn't be happier.For little money you get a great AIO that provides excellent pictures and documents.Good luck!Sheila
3,Best Buy,I have this printer and it sure as heck doesnt cost $400.00! I bought mine brand new from best buy for $100.00
3,Just a question.....,"I'm looking for a new all in one printer because I'm done fighting with our HP 1401. I have not yet found a way to ""cancel"" the print. I've tried opening the active printer window and telling it to delete all pending documents, turning it off, unplugging from both the power and pc, restarting pc...nothing works. When it comes back on it will still try to print the document (this machine has a better memory than I do:) it is impossible to clear it) After reading many reviews on Amazon I've not seen any mention of ""cancel print"" issues. This C5280 looks to have the features I want but would like to know if anyone has had a ""cancel print"" problem with it."
2,"Printing DVD is okay, but forget scanning","I should have known better than to buy a low-end HP printer, but the features sucked me in. I need to print at least 2 test pages before the colors print correctly, which wastes A LOT of ink. The scanner is worthless. The only positive feature is the ability to print on DVDs, but again I need to print test pages before I can get a simple black and white label. If I don't, the labels come out purple or pink. This is the last HP color print I will EVER buy. Don't make the same mistake I did."
4,Genuinely Easy,This Printer was easier to use even with the length of timepabout 30 mins-it actually takes to install(Vista OS)to my laptop.The instructions are clear. It is a little noisy.
2,lwoelfel@satx.rr.com,"Installation was very easy, however it could not do every thing I needed it to do. Could not print card envelopes, the user define feature was not complete. HP chat line was of no help in correcting this problem. Scanning was below average, printing a document was below average compared to a Epson. I returned the C5280 back to Best Buy and got another epson, I am very happy with my epson. I've owned Epson before, though I'd try HP, but that was a waste of my time."
1,Worked well until warranty ran out - Then it Died,Actually...pretty good photos. Never tried printing on CDs. The problem came 7 days after the warranty expired and the printer stopped working (had only been used for occasional photos and papers). I tried to get HP to stand behind their product (I'm a repeat customer) but to no avail. HP does not care about the customer once the dollars are in the company's pocket.
2,Good printer but the drivers suck,Good printer but... the installer keeps running all the time on Vista and do you think I can find out how to fix it? The Installer Clean-up utility doesn't help. Very annoying. Do HP actually test these things?
2,not for occasional use,"This machine is made to be used on a regular basis, so it is not good if it's going to sit for days or weeks without printing. I had trouble from the start with color balance too; in fact HP sent a replacement because eveything came out yellowish and it oculd not be adjusted. DO NOT RUN if any of the inks is empty you will dry out the tubes and then it's toast."
2,HP5520,Disappointed. Easy to install. Great size and was hopeful because have done pretty well with HP in past. But scanner results are poor. Loosing detail fromoriginal documents.
1,Ugh.,"This is the worst product I have ever seen -- everything is broken, software installation took years, nothing works, the bloatware is _very_ hard to use, . I have a degree in experimental physics, and know whereof I speak. I will never again buy an HP product."
2,Don't Buy This,"I have two of these printers (wish I didn't have any). They seemed fine at first, but then started breaking down (continual paper jams - both of them) within a year, and they gobble up expensive ink cartridges as well. I've had other HP printers that I was satisfied with, but not this model. Don't buy it."
1,I HATE THIS PRINTER!!!!,"I've had this printer for over a year now. At first it was good, but now it keeps asking me to install the disk for it. I don't know where it is. I've move since then & have misplaced it. Somehow I got it to work, but it's asking for it again. So annoying. Printed fine yesterday, but I can't print a thing from my computer today. It also keeps asking to do updates & when I do it has nothing to update. What a pain. It does this everytime I am on the computer."
1,AVOID,"I have had this printer for over a year now and have regretted my purchase from day 1.Pros:All in One, when they work properlyCons:Burns through ink faster than BP leaks oilScanner freezes when trying to scan multiple pagesIf anything hiccups, you have to shut down everything and start overAvoid this specific printer, HP in general"
1,Good luck if you have Window 7,"This printer used to work when I had Vista, since upgrading to WIndows 7, it no longer works.I have updated, installed, re-installed, diagnosed, every piece of HP software available for this product for windows 7 and nothing works.Easily spent 15 hours doing this.NEVER, again. Not to mention the amount of bloatware they install on your computer if you use their drivers."
1,WORST PRINTER DO NOT BUY!!,We bought this printer in 2007-08? We had trouble with it the first couple months. It would always have paper jams. We called CS and they replaced it for us. This newer one sucks just as much as the other one. It says there are paper jams when there isn't and it won't print. It also has trouble grabbing the paper and photo paper. The Attention light flashes and tells you to put in the paper. Save your money and buy something else!
4,Great all in one and VERY easy to use,"This all in one is very easy to use. I am using it with Vista (no problems installing). I have printed great prints (and I compared them to the exact ones I had printed at labs). I also printed onto Cd's and it was nothing but ridiculously easy.The only reason I have giving it 4 stars is that it is not wireless .. that would have made it an all in one perfect system. However, there are ways to make is wireless so don't let that deter you if you need the cd/dvd printing.The inks are priced much less that other printers I was looking at (epson and canon in particular). We have had all HP printers and once again, this exceeds expectations.You will not be dissapointed. All problems people have written about are because of user or configuration problems. But don't take my work for it..try it yourself."
2,Cannot Print To CDs & DVDs under Mac OS X Snow Leopard,"I've had this printer for 9-12 months and it has been pretty good in general. However, with the recent Snow Leopard release (OS X 10.6), the HP Photosmart Create software displays a message stating ""Direct CD/DVD printing error - The currently selected printer does not support direct printing to a CD or DVD"". This worked very well prior to the Snow Leopard release.HP needs to step up and update their software/drivers! It's not like this OS X release was a surprise to them!"
3,HP PHOTOSMART C5280,"I bought this printer to make CD labels. The CD software doesn't seem to work with a MAC. I have asked HP for help, but have not received any response. Other than that the printer,scanner, copier works well.Earl Kidder"
1,Not reliable,"This printer worked alright for a couple of years, now it seems like I'm troubleshooting every time I want to print anything. Even for this price, there are much better options; pass on this one."
2,"looks good, runs bad",Fisrt of all it was a pain to put together. I ordered two of these because they looked fairly plain and modern. Have had them for about three weeks and one of them just froze up and is not running any more. Will order something more substantial next time.
5,Easily replaced lost output jack bolt on Gibson SG,Somewhere along the way I lost the bolt that fits over the output jack on my Gibson SG... quickly added one of these to my cart just to get that bolt back over the output jack so it would be more secure. It fit perfectly over the Gibson SG standard jack's threads without a hitch!(plus I have the rest of the parts in case they ever need to be replaced)
5,tetherball pole,This was as sturdy a pole as I've ever seen. Easy to put together and my kids and hubby and I have had a lot of fun with it. Worth the money!
1,Might be nice for some but not for me,"I've used this shampoo twice and I won't be using it again; I'm tossing it. It left my hair in abominable condition. I mean it was horrible. I had to use a ton of conditioner to get it all untangled. Plus I had to use a large amount of shampoo too to get a good lather, much more shampoo than even my cheap Suave shampoos, that incidentally have always been good to my hair. But I had to stray from them, didn't I?I always brush my thick, wavy, medium length hair before I wash it, and did no different this time, but after washing my hair it was a complete ratted, tangly straw-like mess. I'm serious, my hair felt exactly like straw.I'm not suggesting everyone will have this issue. I'm just saying this shampoo and I do not a match make."
4,An improving series.,"This book is the second title in the ""Scions of Arrabar"" trilogy, and is an improvement over it's predescessor, ""The Sapphire Crescent"". The plot revealed in the first book is expanded upon here, and expands onto a larger world stage. As the characters struggle simply to survive, I found my interest growing as their misfortune increased. The rather sad plot device used in the first volume having been done away with, this second book succeeds where the first one failed. A truly solid offering."
4,A book for all aside from the jaded and the cynical. Jump!Ju,"Forget the critics' jaded slant. Ahmed is a wonderful story, chock full of inspiration and guidance in bounds.Do keep in mind however that this is a ""fable"" and not one of his longer, more in depth novels.Although steeped in sometimes confusing philosophical banter, Ahmed is more than worth the extra time spent reading very closely as to carefully digest all the hidden wonderment and life inspiring shouts. Each read through, should provide for only more clarity and understanding of Mr. Bradburys' secret recipe for living life as it should be, to it's fullest.A great book to help remind you during times of despair what living is all about.There! Take that BOOKLIST and others. Poke, stab, poke!"
4,A really unusual Fable,"I picked up this book because I'm a fan of Ray Bradbury, and it was one of the featured books around Christmastime. It's a short book, which is nice, Bradbury gives the fable without a lot of excess writing.There is something about the book that really drew me in while I was reading it. Maybe it was the wonderful black and while drawings that are scattered through the book, illustration various scenes. Maybe it was just the story itself, the story of a young boy who learns to think and feel with his heart and mind, and learns to fly with the help of a most unusual god. Whatever the reason the book drew me in, it was a valid one. The book is a good one, with an important moral, provided you take the time to sit down and read it."
1,A big waste of time,"If you have to return anything to Amazon, they are fantastic in their response to any problem and prompt to make your purchase satisfactory. Because, ---this is all you will be doing by purchasing this product as it is very inferior. After a few hours of frustration in trying to download pictures to this item, I realized it was not going to work at all and was a complete waste of my time. I was sorry I ever bought it but Amazon made the return simple and very satisfactory. That was the only good part about the transaction."
1,fake name decieving title,the correct name is PERSIAN GULF. UNITED NATIONS says so in resolutions ratified in 1971 and 1983. dirty arab dollars cannot change history
4,Nice quality and good value,"I got 3 pairs to send as gifts and they were a great value, very high quality in all aspects, a little smaller than I had envisioned, but very satisfied. They also came with an adorable gift box!"
4,"OK, not as good as the Bigelow","Amazon sent me a shipment of this by mistake when I ordered a different Stash flavor (the carton was mis-labeled), and I got to keep it. It's OK, but I'm finding that I really prefer the Bigelow pumpkin spice brand instead. Perhaps because it's a decaf, the Stash seems weak-flavored by comparison.Update: I ordered another box, and this batch seems to have a stronger flavor. Judging by other reviews here as well, Stash might have some issues with consistent strength/flavor in this product."
2,Dusty and bland taste,"Usually I like Stash brand tea, but not this one! It doesn't taste like pumpkin, and both the ""spice"" element and the black tea taste old in a bad way. It's bland and dusty. The spice seems mainly cinnamon and clove. I tried one and gave the rest away to my workplace, it was so bad. Now I'm curious to see if anyone drinks it there!"
5,Tastey tea,"I don't drink coffee, but really like different types of tea. This tea is definitely a keeper."
3,myspace.com/barropanama,"very good, but id rather hear her younger voice. look for her old stuff, but still beautiful.chao, BARRO. COMBATE Fight Club. [...]"
4,Good! Different though!,"so new jaci cd was supposed to come out nov 9 last year, and no wmay 3rd 2005 its finally out, being a big fan orf UNSPOKEN i ve been looking forward to this release for awhile and remember being even more so when she said it would be more organic and instrumental and mor eof the typ eof music shes personally listenign too! it is! its more rocky edgy differenty type of sound, has a couple misses but mostly very well produced and well worth the wait since its not just unspoken songs regergitated with ew lyrics.! hope u purchase and enjoy!"
2,"Same Music, Different Package","I read several different on-line reviews for this CD before I purchased it. Each seemed to imply that this CD was a new direction for Jaci, that her lyrics were bolder and the overall sound was much more independent in nature. Strange. I must have purchsed the Prozac copy of this CD because there is nothing new here from her. Like my title line to this review states, it's the exact same music she has always sang, just in a different package. Now the CD just collects dust. What a shame."
5,#1 diet advice,Great book if your really want to lose weight. It's as easy as 1-2-3! More writers should boil it down to the essence as Mr. Sullivan has done. This book is common sense with a smile!
2,Dissapointed!,"Very poor quality! I purchased this as a Christmas gift and was very disappointed with the color, clarity, and movement on the CD. The picture was very jumpy which was very distracting! I would never buy from this seller again!!! If not for the fact it is the recipient¡s favorite, I would have returned it. It looked like it was recorded from the TV with a hand held camcorder."
3,Yesteryear,"I remembered watching this movie as a child so I decided to get it. It's not quite like I remembered, there are a lot of songs sung in this movie, which it definitely not my thing. It could be compared to a bad disney sequel, however, I still love how John and his brother try to get their dad to let them open presents at midnight, because technically it's the 25th. My favorite parts are usually revolved around Odie, especially when he makes the back scratcher for Garfield."
5,A Christmas Tradition!,"I am 20 years old and my mom taped this for me when I was about 4. This tape has been viewed at least 20 times per Christmas every single year. I adore Garfield, my whole bedroom theme is Garfield along with every Garfield comic book and movie. This one is one that truly warms the heart. Garfield can make anyone laugh with his grumpy sarcasm and adoration for harrassing dogs and teasing Jon, but it will warm your heart to see the grumpiest cat turn into the worlds biggest softie. I love to see Garfield so happy and loving. He's so sweet to befriend Gramma, and give her a Christmas gift, and to hug Odie. I always tear up seeing him and Odie dancing at the end! This is the cutest movie ever made, and it's a family tradition to watch it. I even have my 6 year old niece addicted to Garfield now! This one brings the holiday spirit every time."
2,Garfield Chistmast,"It was great to finally share a wonderful story I remember with my kids. I've been looking for this tv special for ages and don't know why it's not on any more. Unfortunately, the quality is poor. Fades from a bright color to almost black in white several times."
1,Garfield Christmas,I remember watching this every year and was surprised it was so hard to find. I was happy that I found it and then not so happy after watching it. The whole dvd was in pink and green only. Its not the same watching Garfield as a hot pink cat! Will be returning it!
4,good stuff,"This plumper has a good burn. It is a clear neutral red. I wish it had a tad more pigment, but you can see some red."
4,"Harry Potter, newspaper man investigates kid suicides.","(Cover Blurb) All over America thousands of kids were jumping off buildings. Ace reporter Harry Porter had the only lead. All he knew was that it somehow involved the Church of the Ancient Astronauts, a conspiracy to kill the President, and the imminent threat of nuclear war. Harry Porter was the last of a dying breed, a hard-drinking, womanizing print journalist in an age of tranx bars and ""happy news"" video. He had the biggest scoop of his checkered career- if he lived long enough to file it.I have read the book five or six times. The story of Harry and his friends(one of them a household computer) coming together to save the country, never fails to hold me. It is one of the few story lines that I have combed the book shelfs for, in vain."
4,"A large fast hard drive, but maybe not worth the money","I was running (2) 75gig Raptor hard drives with the OP system on one and other programs on the other, and a third for storage of documents but it would get sluggish when searching for files. So I went to the one 300 gig Velociraptor and combined the two Raptors on it. Oddly enough it seems to me that the Single drive is acually a bit slower than the two drives in day to day switching between files and programs, but it no longer freezes during the start of a search. If I had to do it over again I would probably opt for the cheaper high quality 7000rpm drives. Six months and it still works well. It is definately a lot faster than your basic budget hardrive. So if your looking for a speed boost and you don't want to fool around with several drives this is the way to go."
5,love the rhythm,My baby and I LOVE the captivating rhythms of this music. You can't help but get up and dance along!
5,Great! It's the only thing that stops my son from crying in the car!,"I put on the music, and he either smiles or sleeps. Can't beat that!"
4,"Addictive CD, would have liked more background information","I bought this to teach students more about music in different African countries and found the music very addictive and upbeat. One thing that would have made this (and many other Putumayo CDs) better would be if Putumayo provided full translation of the lyrics. Some songs (e.g. Jambo Bwana, Battu, etc.) only had translations for one paragraph of the lyrics while other songs did not have any translations at all (e.g. Mbube, Hello Hello)."
5,Upbeat and funky,"Love this music. My children love this music. Play it when the weather is wet to cheer yourself up, or play it when the weather is warm and feel even more upbeat! Great for dancing too, and doing the housework too as well."
2,Was OK,"I expected a lot more, so I was mildly disappointed. There were a least 3 songs that I kept in constant replay."
3,comfortable shoe,A very comfortable shoe but a little to high for me. I keep them in the office and wear them in the summer.
5,I LOVE THIS GUY!! :),"I'm a huge Harry Connick, Jr. fan, and I heard this guy's voice and was intrigued by the similarity. However, at closer review, I realized that where Harry is N'awlin's jazzy, Michael is Sinatra classy, and it's nice to have a change. This album is even better than his first (which was great), and I can't stop listening to it. The duet with Nelly Furtado was not good, but everything else was highly enjoyable and I would recommend it to anyone who likes smooth big band sound!"
5,love this cd,"This CD is filled with great songs both old and new. Michael Buble's style is very Sinatra, and yet he also incorporates a new updated sound to his music. I love the whole disc."
5,it's time....to enjoy this instant classic.,"I loved every song. It's really that simple, he's a true vocalist.When I first heard his songs I didn't know if I was listening to Frank Sinatra, Bobby Darin, or Harry Connick, Jr.Songs that standout:1) feeling good2) a foggy day3) you don't know me4) quando, quando, quando w/nelly furtado5) home - my favorite6) can't buy me love7) the more I see you8) save the last dance for me9) try a little tenderness10) how sweet it is11) song for you w/chris botti12) i've got you under my skin13) you and IOH wait, that's every song!!!"
3,Bit disappointed,"I greatly anticipated this album, but was sort of disappointed. The songs are good, but not nearly as good as his first two albums. They are starting to sound a bit... overproduced and cheesy Vegas lounge style. His voice is still great though. I did enjoy ""Feelin' Good"", and ""Quando Quando Quando"". ""Home"" nearly makes me cry. The rest of the album... just kind of blah.I also was very disappointed to find that when trying to convert these songs to mp3 format for my Dell DJ, they sound like they are ""skipping"", making them nearly impossible to listen to. It plays just fine in the regular cd player though."
3,covers,He can sing yes. But he has no originality! Almost every song is a cover and Try a little tenderness is such a classic. Total rock and he slows it down and makes to song boring.
2,It's not really time.,"According to this CD, it's time. But it isn't. I checked. This CD might be a liar. I'll let you know when it's time.Murph"
1,Spend your money on the originals,"Buble is pure record company hype and more the work of a publicist than any musical accomplishment. It sells and that's all that matters. The deceased original artists are light years better but marketing magic has put Buble in everyone's faces. At some point, Buble will flame out through overexposure or the teeny boppers grow up. Buble represents why music is in such disarray through monopolistic practices that emphasize star making marketing over artistry, which retards the development of new sounds and talent. The day will come when people will toss their Buble, Brittany Spears, and Ashlee Simpson CDs in the trash heap wondering, ""What was I thinking when I bought this schlock?"""
1,My Poor Ears,"I have this Japanese restaurant I like (a lot) near my workplace that assaults my ears with M Buble CD's during my lunch... What a horrid way to ruin a dining experience for a customer. I can't believe how terrible the arrangements are! This muses is boring, mutinous, predictable, and just plain irritating"
4,Great singer not so great,"Much as it pains me to say it, this album is a distinct falling off from Michael Bublé's debut disc.Once again he covers all too often, not just his idols' songs, but even their arrangements -- including one of the most legendary, the Nelson Riddle setting for Sinatra's ""I've Got You Under My Skin."" I'd prefer to hear Bublé update the standards, not just echo them. But much more troubling, Bublé seldom sings with the sustained open tone and long line that made his earlier performances such a delight. Still, don't let this keep you from catching Bublé live. That's where he's always been at his best."
3,He just can't do the blues....only slightly convincing,"I like Mike. He's a talented guy, but this, and the Call Me Irresponsible CD are just ok. He makes a few attempts in areas where he is not proficient, doesn't have the training, or the voice, but makes a decent go of it. However, the end result simply isn't convincing. He should stick with covers as he did in his opener, and even then, try not to make them his own by changing the musical accompaniment vastly. Good Jazz/Crooner, stick with it! Don't let the producers get in your way."
3,So-so,This is a so-so group of renditions - it kind of puts you to sleep at times - but not too bad.
3,He Needs To Sing Some More Originals,"Their isn't much I can add to the numerous reviews that were written before this one. Yeah, he's got a great voice, he's a crooner.....and so on. I just wish that they would let this guy sing some more original songs. Most of us are tired of remakes. I know it's because the studios and copyright holders make money...but, all that being said...HOME is the best song on this CD. I bought it for that song only and really don't care about all the remakes."
2,dissapointed,I bought this CD for the song HOME and expected the same type of music for the remainder of the CD. To my dissapointment the CD had all remakes of music I didn't care for. But with his twist on the oldies crap we're all so sick of it was enjoyable....but I sill threw it away! Sorry!
5,"Impeccable credentials, impeccable performance","The glowing accolades that have been bestowed on this artist for his singing style and ability are well deserved. I sat captivated by this Wiltern Theater (it's a magnificent venue) experience and for once it's pleasing to see all the hype and media exposure surrounding an artist be of his down home qualities and not some tabloid making exploits. Apparently he's a warm man with family values and hasn't let his success go to his head. If nothing else this dvd lets you glimpse the real man and his amazing voice, and the glimpse leaves me impressed and wanting to hear and see more of him."
5,Never gets old!,"More favorites from Michael. Sooo easy to listen to and selections take me back to times when young people actually danced together...not like today...doing their ""own thing""."
4,It's a new day for a fabulous CD,"Love this CD. I had heard his music on a PBS concert program and loved his voice. Did not know much of his music but this CD has some remakes that sound great! If you like the Frank Sinatra sound, you will love this CD."
3,"Great arrangements, but this is not Sinatra","I decided to check out Michael Buble's album ""It's Time"" to see what all the fuzz about him was about. No matter how many times I heard the album: what I found was a young Canadian artist singing 13 standards rearranged to fit into a big band feel. Buble's singing was above average, but the abundant comparisons to Frank Sinatra are frankly an overstatement. For the most part, it is the arrangements by legendary producer David Foster that truly carry the weight in the album, including the surprising jazz version of The Beatles' ""Can't Buy Me Love"". Overall, the album deserves three stars, not more. If you want to listen to some recent amazing singing of standars, I would instead recommend ""Songs from the Last Century"" by George Michael, released in 1999."
4,Another Wonderful Album,"Michael Buble has already proven himself as an accomplished, mature crooner with just a few albums. As I mentioned in my review of his first, eponymous album, his voice is flawless. However, especially in this genre, his choice of material is crucial to his success. As in his first album, he succeeds wonderfully with some songs and he falls flat with others. ""Feeling Good"" and ""You And I"" are gems; I have never heard them sung better. However, ""Can't Buy Me Love"" goes over the top; it is pure lounge and kitsch, and it does not succeed. Covering a Beatles song is daunting in itself, but doing so in this manner is just silly. But even though all the tracks are not impeccable, I highly recommend this album because most of it is first-rate."
5,Pleasantly Surprised!!!,"I probably would not have bought this CD if a friend hadn't mentioned he was going to be in the audience when Michael Buble performed on The Today Show. I decided to tune in and watch the show and once Michael started to perform, I became an instant fan. This CD is great, I thought I might like some of the tracks, but now I can't decide which one I like the best, as they are all great!"
4,very enjoyable,"very enjoyable, this is very easy to listen to, If you like Tony Bennett, Natalie Cole you will enjoy this CD."
5,A fine collection for all ages,"This contains a mixture of traditional vocals and lively jazz interpretations of songs previously made popular by the likes of Frank Sinatra and Karen Carpenter. I was pleased when my 19 year old girl, formerly into rap, fell in love with this album."
5,"Sultry, silky and the smoothest voice I've ever heard","Call me infatuated by Michael Buble. Where has he been all my life? Since discovering his music at my health club after the holidays, I just can't get enough of his silky smooth stylings.Buble's on in my spin class and in my car and in my office and in my library. Never have I felt this way about a singer before.I couldn't choose one favorite song, but I can't help but feel great every time Feeling Good plays."
5,Spectacular!,"I decided to pick up this CD which is my introduction to Buble. There was nothing but incredible romance, love and music with meaningful lyrics. I was so happy and pleased. My favorite is ""Feeling Good"" which will definitely make you feel great! I also love the modern remakes of ""You & I"", Can't Buy Me Love"", and ""How Sweet It Is"". Overall the CD is incredible and touching."
4,nice CD,i actually picked this CD up at a local starbucks after seeing the starbucks add on tv.I took it home and listened to it and i loved it. Micheal has a great flawless voice. My favorite song on it is Fly away.A perfect gift for christmas.
5,Great music,"This is the best collection you can get.I enjoyed every song.My friends from different age all enjoyed his songs too.Very classic, very relaxing."
2,ok CD,"I love the songs ""Home"" and ""Save the last dance"" but everything else is different. Had I known, I would have just downloaded those two songs. I'd pass on the cd."
5,Buble Review,Loved it!! Love his style of singing and his voice is magnificent and not bad to look at either!!
2,Disappointed,"This is my first Michael Buble CD, and I gotta say I was disappointed. After all the hype, I was expecting something really great, but Frank Sinatra leaves Buble in the dust (as does the rest of the ratpack). When I was listening to the CD, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was in some cheap hotel lounge. I kept expecting to hear the clinking and clanking of glasses and silverware during the music. I think this singer has some talent, but there is nothing special here so far that distinguishes him from every other lounge singer. I also did not like the female who did the duet with him. Her voice sounds kind of nasally to me, and I keep skipping over that song so I don't have to hear her.I mean, this CD is all right if you want some background music at a cocktail party or something, but it's not so great for just listening to."
2,"Flawed, may have moments","When you do songs that are associated with classic artists such as Frank Sinatra, you should at least try to surpass and transcend what came before. Mr. Buble really does not succeed. There are too many uncomfortable sequences within songs, where I felt he was ""walking through it"", rather than selling it. The album does have a shining moment. ""You and I"", known only to me as sung by Barbra Streisand, is a masterpiece of phrasing and restraint; what a cut!"
1,Boring,I have listened to this CD twice. Once to see what all the fuss was about and the second time was because it was being played at a wedding reception. I guess the DJ played this CD because he knew it is so vanilla it wouldn't offend anybody. There is nothing about this gentleman's voice or the arrangements that jump out at me. I will commend him for the great song selection. But I just felt bored while listening. Very bland.
1,It's Time this guy stopped churning out cheese,"This, like Buble's previous cd, is TERRIBLE!!!!!! I am a jazz musician, and to have this joker claim to represent jazz is enough to make me sick. He is pure cheese, lacks taste, and I hope his career is extremely short. Surely no one can continue success like this, based on such garbage."
2,So so album.,"Not that great. his voice is something to be desired. One or two songs ok, the rest mostly stink. Wish I had passed."
4,My sister loved it.,This was a gift for my sister. She was pleased to get the CD of her favorite vocalist. She enjoys it while driving all of the time.
5,"REFRESHINGLY GOOD, BUBLE' REIGNS SUPREME!","JUST A JOYFUL CD FROM END TO END. THE VARIETY IS AWESOME AND SWEET SOUNDING WITH WONDERFUL ARRANGEMENTS AND PERFORMED BY OBVIOUSLY VERY TALENTED MUSICIANS.I WISH MR. BUBLE' LUCK IN HIS CAREER ----- THIS IS THE TYPE OF MUSIC THAT NEEDS TO BE ENCOURAGED TODAY ----- SONGS THAT HAVE WARM LYRICS, THE RIGHT MESSAGES AND SUNG WITH A PASSION AND RICH STYLE THAT WILL PLEASE EVERY AGE........."
5,AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The best, so far. more than Sinatra, Buble evokes the memory & style of the great Bobby Darin. Not since Darin has a singer come along that can carry the torch in the tradition of Sinatra & all the greats!! Watch out Connick, because Buble WILL leave you in the dust!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! A first rate album. BRAVO!!"
5,A Great CD,"Michael Buble, singing in the classic style that hearkens back to Ole Blue Eyes and Dean Martin, is in fine form on It's Time. A great CD that gets even better with repeated listenings. The following are song by song reviews:1. Feeling Good 4/52. A Foggy Day (In London Town) 5/53. You Don't Know Me 3/54. Quando, Quando, Quando 3/55. Home 5/56. Can't Buy Me Love 3/57. The More I See You 4/58. Save The Last Dance For Me 5/59. Try A Little Tenderness 5/510. How Sweet It Is 4/511. Song For You (Featuring Chris Botti) 5/512. I've Got You Under My Skin 5/513. You And I 4/5"
5,Michael Buble reigns,This cd is excellent. Michael sounds asthough he could have been one of Frank Sinatra's friends. So smooth and jazzy. I recommend this cd to anyone looking for awesome vocals and duets. Listening to Michael sing takes me back to a time when the music touched your heart and soul.
5,Wonderful dancing and listening music!,"As a dancer and lover of exquisite music I really appreciate the ballroom music as Michael Buble presents and executes it.So very romantic. The tempo, beat, cadence - all superbly done. His rich vocal tember renders the musical chords with a richness I've never heard before. If he had been Sinatra - Sinatra would have been alot more popular. While those of us from the older generation loved some of those songs, Mr. Buble represents them with a fresh new blending of passion and committment that Sinatra never had. Bravo Mr. Buble! When will the next album be out?"
5,In the Mood,Michael Buble sings great songs with intonations and a voice that makes them even better. Great arrangements complement his singular voice. His duet with Nellie Furtado on 'Quando Quando Quando' is fantastic. 'You and I' is the best song on the album. The kind of music that makes you feel you are on vacation at a swanky bar and grill overlooking the water on a warm summer evening while you are enjoying a cocktail and the company of the most enchanting woman you've ever had the pleasure to meet - it really gets and keeps you 'in the mood'
5,Great,"Great cd. I had a chance to see him this weekend Feb 12, 2006 for his first ever Las Vegas appearance. He is tremendous, killer band, plays to the audience. I thought he was good on cd, seeing him in person. he is great. I had the oppurtunity to see a special performer. I can look back and say, I saw him in Vegas when he first appeared there. If you get the chance to see him in person,do not miis him. A major talent!"
3,This is my first Buble cd,"My favorite A song for you, I bought the disc because I listened it, I did not like the others as much, even when I forced myself to listen them a lot, anyway I agree the disc is great."
3,Great hit single,"I bought this cd for the single ""Home"" which i thought was great. ""Home"" was the only song of its kind on this album. Buble is very jazzy and sounds much like Sinatra. I like the rest of the album was was disappointed that many of the songs are covers, would like to have heard more original works."
2,Bright future for young song stylist...,"On the recommendation of a friend, I recently purchased the second CD, ""It's Time,"" of a young Canadian song stylist by the name of Michael Buble. Having a rather eclectic musical taste I didn't expect much from the CD, certain my friend had over-hyped it. Was I ever surprised! This is, without doubt, the single best CD that I have ever purchased. Buble's voice, his phrasing and the song selections on this CD make this a listening experience that should be shared with the world. I hope for nothing but great success and continued production from this rising star."
3,Underwhelmed,"I had heard an interview with Michael Buble in which they played the first track, ""Feeling Good."" It was jazzy, full of big band sounds and great original-sounding vocal styling. I bought the CD thinking it would all be like that. I was just underwhelmed. The covers are not as good as others that have done them, e.g.,""Try a Little Tenderness"" is like a kitten mewing compared to Michael Bolton's lion roaring. His ""I Get a Kick Out of You"" was a complete rip off of Sinatra, virtually in every detail, including orchestration. It's okay, but not what I was expecting based on that first track."
2,Least Essential Album of 2005?,"There is simply no reason for this album to exist. It will be all over the bargain bins within a year. There is no added spark or anything but by-the-numbers arrangements-- it sometimes sounds like parody. Who will seek this stuff out in 5 years? No one. Buy the originals instead. Unless you like imitation swing like Rod Stewart-- then this is for you. If you'd like to hear Beatles songs with a jazz/swing twist, listen to John Pizzarelli Meets the Beatles."
5,Incredible Incredible and better than Incredible!!!,"What a phenomenal singer. This guy is pure magic!!!!!To cover each and every song with such positive energy and life is an inspiration to those of us who enjoy good music.Highlights are Home, Save the last Dance and Quando Quando.Can't buy me love would make the Beatles proud and You and I moved me beyond words.Try it, buy it and you will be uplifted with each play.........."
4,Over the top...,"I honestly have to say I prefer Michael's first album ""Michael Buble"" over his second, it's just a much more heartfelt effort, while the song selection and execution of ""It's time"" is somewhat uneven.Don't get me wrong, I think ""Home"" is a great song, but I felt a bit deceived after listening to the full album, which I fully expected to be more of a pop record (at least that's what the single made you believe).I don't think Michael's follow-up effort quite matches his first album in terms of vocal charm (he sounds horrible when he shouts as he doesn't quite have the breadth and depth of voice) or intimacy of the musical arrangements.But what really gets me is the appalling degree of commercialization that this album comes with. I mean how many more bonus tracks and special editions do we really need to satisfy an artists/record label's greed?"
2,It Aint Got That Swing,"This is my first Michael Bulé album. This guy has a great voice, but the arrangements and his phrasing are all plain vanilla and boring, in my opinion. This is the kind of music a middle-aged White woman who goes to the Meyerson hall in Dallas likes. I put this in the same category as Michael Bolton or Kenny G.In my opinion, it's all very formula, very predictable, and has no soul.This is the kind of act I'd expect at Disney World or a cruise ship."
5,It's Time Review,"I am so glad I purchased this CD. I absolutely love it. I heard Michael's song, ""Home"" and couldn't wait to find the CD it was on. He has a great voice and the songs he chose to represent on his recent CD was other favorites of ours as well.Cheers!"
5,Michael Buble,"IF you love Frank Sinatra, you'll love his music. Bought it for a Xmas gift, based on listening to the samples provided by Amazon. Many of his songs are from the early era and refined. My mother in law loves it, but so do I. This is the 4th CD I bought."
3,"In the shuffle, but not on top.","I love man, sexy man, singing main stream stuff.I like this one, but he's not on top of the shuffle.Keep on trying Michael, you just might need a betterproducer. This one sounds good, but I maybe he needs hisheart broken by a Ava Gardner..."
1,This will not import in itunes for playing on an ipod,"This was good when I listened on my stereo to a couple of songs, but when I went to import it into itunes for playing on ipod, it will not see the CD. If you are interested in putting this on your ipod don't buy this CD. (Windows Media Play will not recognise this CD either)"
3,Mediocre,"Very Nice recording. But that's what happens when you sing the standards and have a good voice. It just doesn't sparkle. The voice is competent but a bit flat. Did these songs need to be covered again? Rather than buy this CD, one might do better to buy the originals."
2,Not like the last !!!!,"No, I didn't like the new CD at all.He is going off 'the mark' of what works for him. Someone needs to tell Michael that he can't take ANYTHING and make it work for him. He has a niche in a certin type of music (big band, Sinatra, Darin, etc.). THAT is his niche where he thrives not a remake of the Beetles and pop music! AGHHHH!"
2,A fine whine,"I've tried to listen to 'Home' all the way through when it comes on an easy listening station. I haven't been able to make it through yet. Awful stuff. Whiney, pitying, 'poor me' glop."
4,Good Stuff,Buble is cool and smooth. The more you listen the more you appreciate his talent. I would recommend to anyone.
3,My words were cold and flat,"I'm not ashamed to say it: ""Home"" is beautiful. As much as I despise the American Idol movement for reducing much of modern music to little more than a competition to see whose vocals carry the farthest, here, in ""Home,"" there is some delicious fruit off of that hideous vine.The rest of the album? A pleasant singing voice dubbed over harmless melodies. Yep."
1,Poor Design,"This looks to be a good design. A metal wheel, large number display and built-in sidekick to hold it upright.However, the plastic hinge system is fragile and breaks easily. On the second day after delivery, the hinge broke when pushing it over a curb.This unit is for very light duty applications around the house or office. I would look elesewhere for units to be used in the field."
2,Ugh,"This book was poorly organized, and I couldn't seem to figure out why it was organized the way that it was. Directions were often confusing, or not forthcoming, and there were multiple occasions where the definitions in the book weren't correct, as I was able to verify through two French majors, a native French speaker, and several dictionaries. The exercises often have the same issues. Contained a fairly substantial amount of vocab, most of which was correct. Definitely didn't help me learn to communicate about anything of great importance (e.g. booking a hotel room, detailed directions, food, beverages, etc)."
5,Great picks.,These are the only picks I use. They're Fender thins and the quality is one thing that Fender has kept consistent. They arrived on time and I will order them again.
1,THAT NOT SAMPLING THAT'S RIPPING OFF,"Total rip off.You can't event call that an art of sampling.Lots of cuts,remixes,remakes,textures that has already been sampled by truth genius, T.Corp just rip off identically the cuts already sampled , No credit in that at all cause there almost no layer added by them.For sure they're real thieves! and they have a good sense of sound marketing.Doesn't deserve to be bought."
1,The Outernational Sound (Theivery Corporation),"Outernational Sound was disappointing to me because it contained NO NEW TUNES by Thievery Corporation. Instead of innovative, original compositions, as in The Richest Man in Babylon (""All songs written and produced by Rob Garza and Eric Hilton...""), this CD is a compilation of other works (""Thievery Corporation would like to thank all of the artists who created this music""), as well as 1 rehash of the title tune from The Richest Man in Babylon. I bought this CD under false pretenses--I was not looking for a DJ mix. I hope these musicians haven't retired from creativity permanently."
4,Lounge music,"This CD is great! Just play, lay back and chill. The beats are melow and invigorating. I can't take this out of my CD player."
1,POOR Choice,"If you live in an area where static electricity is present, you will not be happy with this phone. I paid $150 for this phone in Aug/2007 and it has been disabled 3 times in that period due to static, each time, requiring replacement parts. Today it was knocked out again and I have thrown it in the garbage. I will not throw away my money again on products made by this company."
2,Kindle E-Book Has No Images,"This is a review for the Kindle E-Book rather than the book itself. The content seems interesting enough but there are NO IMAGES due to copyright reasons in the electronic version, negating any usefulness the this format may offer. I mean seriously, a textbook with no diagrams? When I purchased the book, there was an alert telling me that Kindle E-Books may or may not contain all images, but I couldn't imagine this. I called customer support and after making my case, they made an exception of their return policy and refunded me."
4,Good intro book,"Excellent overview of a field that is growing. I started out in biofeedback but had been out of it for 20 years. Went to a workshop reviewing the latest in QEEG and neurofeedback, so I wanted to learn more. This book has given me a good sense of what I will need to do to get back into this area of treatment and analysis."
1,No images,"Disappointing that there were no images -- graphs, diagrams, photos, etc. -- included in the Kindle version that I bought for my iPad."
3,Not basic!,"Having no experience with neuroscience, I began this book as a preparation for training in Neurofeedback. I took the title at it's word, ""Getting Started"". While I learned a lot reading the book, it assumes a certain level of knowledge of brain science and is quite badly organized for a beginner. I found myself slogging through very difficult, unexplained material which was then somewhat clarified in later chapters. I found myself wondering why the author didn't organize the material with the introductory material at the beginning and work up to the more complex theories and technical details. The author is obviously very versed in the subject, but the material is not user friendly. It's probably worth reading with the caveat that you'll have to go back and forth to figure out what he's talking about. In retrospect, I wish I'd read ""Symphony in the Brain"" first which is a history of neurofeedback."
5,Fabulous Book!,"While I'm new to the topic of neurofeedback and EEG training, this book provided a solid grounding on the subject. While this book is NOT for the lighthearted newbie, I can honestly say that I learned a tremendous amount. Even though there is considerable material to digest, I'm reading the book very slowly (and with a highlighter next to me). I know I'll read it again and continue to use it as a reference."
4,Good get-started manual,"This is the only book that I have seen that doesn't just give a theoretical overview of the field of neurofeedback but actually gives a workable, usable protocol which the reader can follow to get started with their equipment. I have found out the hard way that although one's intentions to work w/NF can be good the task of actually using it can be daunting. Unless you enjoy writing computer code and designing programs you will have a tough time getting started in this field. This manual gives you a streamlined method for step-by-step process of beginning to measure neurofeedback. I have used it successfully to measure basic neuro-quotients, where previously I was lost.Jonathan Golden"
4,OK from an historical point of view,"The book is well done, clear and a comprehensive introduction to neurofeedback. I enjoyed reading (studying) it. I must say I mostly appreciated it from an historical point of view though. It describes the old way of doing neurofeedback -- still much in use -- and for instance doesn't mention that qEEG as a basis for neurofeedback has been outdated for several years now. Unfortunately there are no books detailing the more recent neurofeedback tools..."
2,Not what was expected.,"This book is not about synchronicity. The word ""synchronicity"" does not appear anywhere in the book. I found this book on a website called The Synchronicity Times. And I like the web site. I clicked on Recommended Reading and got this book. But this book is about, as I see it, the author's feelings on how we should dissolve social sexual mores. Bascially the Sixties Sexual Revolution plus some Hindu philosophy plus some New Age ideas. Pretty impractical in real life, and a bit childish. Just my opinion. If this is your thing, groovy."
5,Very cute!,I bought this for my nephew who absolutely loved it! He couldn't wait until after his party to register it on the computer. They are just the cutest things!
5,Webkniz Lion,I think Webkinz is a wonderful tool to teach kids the meaning of a dollar and responsibility at a young age. And has a good educational value when it comes to some of the games the kids can play to earn kinz cash.
5,Super Cute,He is very cute and cuddly and my little girl loves him. The shipping was very quick and it arrived in time for the holidays. Good value also.
4,Cute animal.,I do like this one but some of the coloring was too pale yellow so it was a bit not what I expected overall.
2,Ok for kids,My daughter wanted this when she was about 10 years old. It was as described and came in a reasonable amount of time.
5,Fun Fun Fun,The dolls are really cute and fun. It is really fun with the first birthday playset. The cute little kids sized table and other Birthday gifts go well with the other birthday fun. I like the cute little toddler size of the dolls. It was great to add something so fun to my Barbie collection.
2,Leaves out much,"While the premise of this book is to use BY to show how the American west expanded, it is deeply flawed by being largely uncritical of the absurd foundations of the Mormon ""church"". The author lays out what Joseph Smith made up out of whole cloth and called a religion, but then does not go in depth about how preposterous it is, and never really gets into why BY bought into the whole fraud."
5,Solid Choice,"This is a great watch that gives accurate time every day - looks good and functions flawlessly. After a year in a sometimes dirty, sweaty, physical environment, my Deville looks brand new. The crystal hasn't a scratch. A light soap and water rinse and I'm ready for dinner out with the better half. In terms of appearance and performance the watch is a great value. My other Omega purchased in 1967 (yes, I'm old) still works perfectly but I'm saving it for my grandkids. The difference in the crystals is interesting as this Deville doesnt scratch while the '67 does easily. After 41 years of using/wearing Omega I've learned that it's the world standard"
2,Not the worst book I've ever read,"At least the author seems to try her hand in making sense of her lyric thrust. The first section of the book is overly ornate with teutonic diction, the others tepid with unimpassioned verse. Echolocations is best read with the lights off for there is little imagery to be seen, or for what matters, located."
5,No holds barred.,"This is another Fiona FitzGerald mystery that closely resembles the Levy/Condit story. (See my review under Warren Adler's Senator Love.) This time, it's a young intern to a Supreme Court Justice who is found brutally murdered. In my opinion, this is the best Fiona mystery to date. Intelligent, engrossing, and with no holds barred."
1,Musica!,"This DVD is too commercial; it lacks real fun and enthusiasm and the ""music"" does not make you feel like getting up to dance.Too 1,2,3 1,2,3 not lively enough. Sorry...."
1,Just awful,"I thought this DVD was so bad, I barely made it through 10 minutes. The warm-up was ridiculously slow; so slow that I skipped to the first work-out segment and again was so disappointed, I quickly turned it off and put in my favorite work-out tape instead. If you really enjoy dancing (specically latin-style dancing), you may like this DVD better than I did. If I could review an item and give it no stars, then this DVD would receive 0 stars."
2,Hmmmmm....,"The ProVista is a very sturdy tripod that is fantastic for taking still photos, or for static video capture... (great price as well) Where the ProVista fails...and it fails in a very, VERY big way is real-time panning. Jerky....ugly....messy.... if you plan on doing any 'live' video work, avoid this tripod at all costs."
1,All Show No Go,"This Tripod looked great out of the box. Very sturdy ... but after one day of work, the leg clamps to hold position started slipping. Pan on head never worked. 4 months later after limping along with this junk the leg clamps just broke off during a shoot.Do Not Buy This Junk.REVISED 9/30/09-I contacted Tiffen about this and they gave me a RMA and I shipped it back at my expense for repairs. It arrived back today. Same tripod, seems to work better in head movement and the leg clamps are holding. I'll update after a couple of shoots.REVISED 10/12/09-OK I've used the dang thing now and it is a lot better after the repairs. So, Not a bad cheapy tripod, and Tiffen stood up for the repairs, but it seemed like a long road for such a minor purchase."
4,Samsung SyncMaster 940N,"After lot of research, I decided to buy Samsung's SyncMaster 940N monitor. I could install it without any problem in a matter of minutes. The pictures are clear and sharp and the size (19 inches) is just right for my home office. With its 3 year warranty I am looking forward to a much better performance than my old CRT model."
5,A great monitor!,"This monitor replaced a 17"" CRT. I have been very pleased with it so far. The picture is clear and bright, colors are very good, side visibility is good. At first, text doesn't seem as clear as a CRT, but your eyes adjust to it after using for a while.And, it sure cleared a lot of space on my desk!"
4,Durable but...,"As a high school tennis coach who feeds balls most of the time and plays students once in a while, I find this string more durable than others that I have used. However, as a former serve-and-volleyer during my younger days, I do find a lack of feel. But that's always the trade off: durability for feel. Still, it does the job for me in my current role."
3,"""Q"" The Autobiography of Quincy Jones","God knows he was blessed with musicial talent. God knows his beginnings were bad, but, you would think folks would try to leave some kind of legacy (not music).He name drops all through the book. I know you have to tell the story of your life, but, some of these people I just did'nt care about!! These are back round folks. I mean way in the back round who cares!!! Check this out. Nadia Boulanger turned down George Gershwin, but took ""Q"" as her student.I don't think he was a good jazz musician, so that's why he chose a different path musically. Some Jazz greats did get hungry from time- to- time, but they stayed with it. They might not have as much money, but some of them can sleep at night.I hope his Kids find Love and Happiness!!"
4,Fascinating View into the Jazz world of the 50's & 60's,"Q's autobiography gives you an insider's look at the jazz scene in the 50's and 60's. Q has met quite a cast of characters in his day and played with the best of them. I found the book very entertaining, but wished it would give more details into the technical aspects of his productions. I would have liked to have read more about his recording techniques and how he put together all those pop albums in the 70's, and 80's.The book is also an excellent source book vis a vis his work with Sinatra, Dizzy, and Basie in the late 50's and 60's."
4,Cool Q,Quincy Jones is amazing. He has done everything in the music business and it's easy to understand why after reading this book. His tough childhood and struggle with relationships shaped his music. He is very very honest and that is what I liked best about the book. He is the kind of guy you would like to meet and have lunch with because he has a million stories about everyone famous in the music world.
4,Book for someone else,"This was ordered as a gift for someone else. It arrived on time as promised. I am not into this whole manga thing, but the gift was appreciated!"
4,Cultural Mystery,"Understanding of the challenges Deaf children face has always been a strength of Jean Andrews work. Matt and his friends once again face the unknown together, and this time they learn about differences between Mexican and American culture. This book is easey for middle graders to read, and will stimulate discussion of different ways of dealing with problems."
4,wrong author,"This set was written and revised by Fathers Hugo Hoever and Thomas J. Donaghy, not by Father Lawrence G. Lovasik. Great set of books about the Catholic Saints."
3,"We are all called to be saints, to lead by virtue and example","This edition from 1955-1974 certainly could be revised again and again. Nevertheless, there is still a certain mystery in the pages of this book.Saints that you probably didn't know about come alive in a very dramatic way, sometimes too dramatic. Many of the saints in the book lived in the early years of Christianity.Because most of the saints of the earlier centuries are revealed in gory details the commentaries should be more relevant to today's teachings from Vatican II.Documents of Vatican II.The modern day saints such as Elizabeth Seton and John Neumann are more appealing, in that they are not glorified as typical martyrs. They lead us by example and virtue."
5,Beautiful!,"Beautiful leather bound books with great short daily readings of the daily Saint, plus a short prayer daily, some also have illustrations. Great way to educated myself and the kids with one only page a day. So beautiful that I bought a set for myself, then for a friend. Would definitely buy again."
3,lovely little book,"Lovely little book of the Saints for the price you pay. For Ten dollars you get what you paid for it but, I would not recommend the book for children though, because the paper probably would not hold up under the abuse of a twelve year old or younger, and the illustrations are plain black and white and very small. I am happy with it but am not going to give it to my niece."
1,Failed Twice!,This is the second fake fish tank I have purchase through Brands for Sale. And both of them the pump does not work correctly. I am truly surprised to see so many good reviews. I dont know if I just have really bad luck but I just wanted to make others aware of the issues I have encountered.
4,Genius Invention,"Just got mine about a week ago and have no complaints. the fish really move around constantly and use a cool system of magnets to avoid banging into each other and promote motion. i love magnets so to me this is almost more fun than watching real fish. i'd be curious to know how much electricity it uses though considering its fairly loud, which is also a good thing. i like having white noise because i live in a small apartment and dont want to annoy neighbors. i just dont want to be wasteful if its using a ton of energy but ideally i'd like to leave it on because it looks kindof boring and dull when its off."
2,agreed,"I agree with the majority of the reviews - these recordings are too passive, the balance is out of proportion much of the time. My only question is (to the powers that be at Polygram) when will we see a re-release of the Iona Brown recordings? They are far superior, and have a 1st-rate continuo ensemble backing her up (the ASMIF Chamber Ensemble)."
3,Not the best recording I own,"Same here. I bought it under the advice of a vendor, but it's quite annoying. I could never listen to it with real pleasure. It just runs in the background and the music doesn't grasp me. Not mentionning the fact that the violin sounds harsh on most systems and without excellent digital equipment, it makes the ear bleed."
3,Complete Works?,"I agree with the ratings above with similar number of stars. The timbre of the violin seems to have an edge to it. But my problem rests in another area. I did not know that there are a number of works attributed to G.F. Handel, but possible not written by him. As the father of a violinist, my task was to get a CD that included the G minor, opus 1, no.10. When I saw ""Complete Violin Sonatas"" I was thrilled and relieved... but I now find, after opening the package, that this specific work is not there and is thought of as ""doubtful"" (as noted in another CD listing on Amazon[.com]). Well, this was my mistake for being quick to accept the claim on the cover. It may sound like an advertisement, but this points out the value of searching Amazon[.com] first to make certain that you get what you need. For providing the information, Amazon[.com} deserves the purchase."
2,Unpleasant frenzy,"Andrew Manze is an amazing violinist. But he's too amazing for his own good. He doesn't know when to hold back. His frantic sawing of these sonatas is really unpleasant. Where it should be lyrical, he is frenetic. If he could just calm down he is capable of playing beautifully. But not here. A major disappointment."
5,More Super Sheppard,"Simon Sheppard's new collection of short fiction ""In Deep"" is further proof that Sheppard is one of the finest writers of erotica that the LGBT community has today. These stories are complex, arousing, poignant, and occasionally unforgettable. There is a delicious perversity to many of these tales that BDSM fans will surely savor. His historical novella about the San Francisco earthquake is fascinating....especially for cowboy enthusiasts like myself. The combination of eroticism and intelligence throughout the collection reminds me of other erotica greats like M. Christian, Patrick Califia, Greg Wharton, and Ian Philips."
2,Technically proficient but not much more,"I was disappointed in this book of erotica, because frankly no story ever felt very erotic to me. The book felt as though it was the result of the author making a list of possible sexual situations and setting a deadline and as each piece was finished, checking off that item on a list.Short stories are always difficult as they require the author to establish scene and characters very quickly as well as to equally quickly invest us emotionally in the characters and their relationship. The author fails to do that -- the writing feels continually detached from the characters and renders them two dimensional.Failing that, the sex in an erotica book needs to be hot. Truthfully, I have read far hotter sex scenes for free on internet erotica sites."
4,"Old School, Madcap Comedy","I discovered Joe Keenan's second novel ""Putting on the Ritz"" at a GLBT library sale and bought it for $1. I loved it so much I immediately went to buy ""Blue Heaven."" Joe Keenan writes with the wit of Cole Porter and the humor of David Sedaris. Both novels are truly funny (I confess to laughing aloud) with unpredictable plot lines, well-drawn characters, and a charm reminiscent of days past. A great read--I am so delighted to see he has another book coming."
1,SO WACKY AND INSANE!!!!! HA HA HA,"What, are these reviewers Joe Keenan's personal friends? This book reads like a really lame sitcom. Plenty of hit-me-with-a-brick foreshadowing, clever quips paced every two pages, wacky characters. I think Mr. Keenan clearly envisioned this piece to be made into some sort of movie (most likely, CBS Sunday Movie sort of thing). Maybe the old group from Three's Company is still available. This would be an ideal John Ritter vehicle."
5,Not enough books like this,"Funny, witty, and well written. It is a lot like Wodehouse, but translated into a different period, and with enough about it that is different that it merits its own accolades.When travelling I long for books like these, and there are very few that meet this level of quality.My only criticism is that he has only written two books. He'll need to do at least 8 more before BBC would ever consider turning them into a series."
5,Laugh-out-loud funny,"I took a chance on this book through a paperback book club I belong to back when it was first published. It is an absolute riot. People looked at me like I was nuts when I would suddenly break out laughing. The gay aspect is not explicit. Joe Keenan, whom I believe is now the head writer for ""Fraser,"" is one talented fellow."
5,"Joe, Please Write Another One!","OK...so it's not Proust. But I defy you to find a more entertaining, funny book! It is a guaranteed laugh-outloud gay romp. In fact, some of the lines are so memorable that I pick up the book and re-read them (which I, of course, have highlighted) when I need a pick-me-up. I just wish that Joe Keenan would dump TV's ""Frasier"" and give us another book as terrific as ""Blue Heaven"" and, to a slighly lesser extent, ""Putting on the Ritz."""
3,Snap in soaker,"I had previously been very impressed with a small bamboozle which worked very well for our newborn daughter. When it was time to size up I ordered these and found that while the small diaper had a sewn in soaker, this diaper had a snap in soaker. I personally detest ""diaper assembly"" after the wash is done and promptly resold them. I agree that these diapers are delightfully soft but thinner than any other fitted diaper I have tried. I do not recommend them to parents planning to cloth diaper."
1,"Not worth the money, snaps fall off before even using them","They are super soft but as I opened them up to toss them in the wash before using I had 3 diapers that the snaps just popped off and flew across the floor. I would hate for my toddler to put broken snaps in her mouth. Besides, $18.50 is a lot for a diaper that seems thinner that I expected and snaps wont last. These might carry the Bummis name but once you get them (and u can see it in the Amazon picture, look closely) the little blue tag says TotsBots which is in the UK and they don't make any diaper I have tried that is any good. USA made diapers are much better and WAHM make much better diapers. I will stick with Ebay and WAHM's diapers. What a waste of money for 5 diapers here!!!"
4,Blackberry Bold,"I purchased this phone and at first was having a lot of trouble, I contacted Amazon about the problem and they immediately shipped me out a new phone. I was very satisfied by how fast they handled my issue. I would definetly order from them again."
3,"Not bad, worth the read or listen","Good story and I love Farouk..but I was a bit disappointed at the story line regarding Mary Magdalene and Jesus. It was shades of Baigent and Lincoln's garbage in the book, HOLY BLOOD, HOLY GRAIL, which was copied and made into a bestseller by another fiction author. Nevertheless the story line was pretty good. Frank is such a depressing character but now there's a new twist that could make him into a new man..can't wait to read the next book!"
3,saduku ?,"never heard of this game before, until i played it on brain age 2, this version is however not as great.its hard to figure out how to play, if you already have brain age 2 or a different version of suduku , stay away from this one"
1,Do not buy this bad game!,"I agree with the other current reviewer. I really was hoping this would be a good Sudoku game, but not being able to put in small numerical notations is just unbelievable. Plus the user interface in not that great either. The people that programmed this should be ashamed of creating this bad game. I am really sorry I bought this! I should have waited for reviews, but was hoping for better. Brain Age Sudoku still beats the pants off of every other such game for the DS so far. That is sad! :("
1,This Kakuro has multiple solutions which should never happen!,Any good Kakuro game has only 1 unique solution. I've tried several in the easy section that have multiple solutions. Why would the game developer not understand the first and most important rule in Sudoku and Kakuro? Had I known this before I bought it - I would have saved my money. I'd give it 0 stars if there was that option!
1,Very Disappointing,"I pre-purchased this game after going through all the Sudoku in Brain Age. This couldn't be farther from the quality and playability of Brain Age if it tried. The game doesn't allow for guesses in the square and you can't see the numbers unless you have VERY good eyesight and it just isn't fun to play. If you liked the Sudoku in Brain Age, you will be very disappointed."
2,Could have been better,This could have been a great game for Kakuro alone. Unfortunately the interface isn't very good. It doesn't allow you to place potential answers in the blocks and that is essential for any Kakuro puzzle to solve. Try Brain Buster Puzzle Pak for the DS or import a Kakuro game [..] for a better game experience.
2,Very disappointed!!,"I don't want to repeat what the other reviewers said, but they are absolutely right. I was really disappointed in this game and, like the others, wish that I had waited for the reviews.Why any of these developers can't come up with a Sudoko and/or a Kakuro game with a similar interface to Brain Age is beyond me.The worst part is that the game board is on the non-touch screen and moving around is extremely cumbersome. Whoops!! I'm repeating what the other reviews said -- sorry!!"
1,do not waste your money on this game,"it is the most boring, non-user friendly game i have ever played! Don't waste your money"
4,Back to '68 in Time for 2008.,"Again tough to rate. I choose 4 Stars when 3 1/2 stars may be more accurate. I just want to comment on the Dates used in the Book, because no one else has. In another book by Hoyt (The one co-written with the Congressman), there were complaints about the dates used. In ""Vivienne"", Munich obviously was not in 1939. WWII was already in effect in September of 1939. Also Dien Bien Phu fell in 1954, not 1956! How could any responsible writer (not to mention editors) make these obvious mistakes?"
1,puh-lease,"this has to be the dumbest thing usher could have done. why does he want to be like michael jackson so much? smh, even michael jackson pissed me off this this kind of crap. some people just love to much attention."
4,"Usher Fans, Right Here!","If you a fan of Usher, you got to get this DVD. I seen it on MTV and it's corny like this other cat say, but I still ordered it. If you like seeing Usher dance and seduce the laydeez then you gonna like this. He acting too."
3,Not A Rhythm City,"I love Usher in ever way.Eyes,body,voice,teeth,lips,everthing.But this DVD and music video (or mini movie) don't work for me.I love all his video but this one the video that I don't like in""Caught Up"" is the video ""Caught Up"" and when I saw the video on t.v on New Years I said ""this is stupid, if Usher know me it would 1,000 % better.'Cause the beginnin' of the ""mini movie"" the song "" Take My Hand "" wasn't the way I so in my mind, I didn't picture it in a ""modern club"" I thought I would be tight if it was in black & white, oldy type of tape, and dress like in the 20's or 30's.That is how I feel people might think she ain't a true Usher fan but this my opinion.I think he his acting more like Michael Jackson. Come on not a lot of people can make music video like ""Thriller"". Don't even think about getting this one. It ain't worther it .AND I'M STICKIN' 2 IT!"
2,Horrible,"Usher's new DVD movie thing is absolutely horrible. I downloaded it from an Usher fansite and watched it and deleted it. The video is so dumb, Usher can't act but hey he's still sexxy!"
3,the blade is on the wrong side for a right handed person,When I bought this saw I did not realize the blade is on the wrong side. I used it to tear down a deck and the motor blew up. If you are left handed and use this saw for small jobs I think will be ok. For heavy jobs I do not recomended it.
4,I may look stupid wearing it.... but...,"We have some nasty biting flies on our island from mid-June to early August. This sure puts a damper on the daily dog walking. With the help of the head net I've been able to enjoy, although looking like a doofus, my daily walks. It certainly did the trick (although my wife won't walk with me anymore)!"
2,Too small,"I am a petite female, and the net rests on my nose because the diameter of the hat and supporting hoop is too small. Cheaply made; broke on second use.Get something better."
3,"Not Exactly Like Picture, but Still Good Value.","It gets the job done, which for me means keeping biting flies (such as deer flies) off of my head.The image shows the net hanging at some distance away from the face. I find that the net sits much closer to the skin; it is not like being comfortably encompassed by netting, but more like being closed in on.Overall, it should protect you from bugs like biting flies. Although, mosquitoes may be able to get through it when the net rests against the skin.(P.S. you may suffer embarassment, because this thing really is not attractive to wear. :D)"
1,I don't recommend this one,"The material on top is very thin cotton that is not tightly woven. As I am bald, it will make the top of my head a target for mosquitoes, which can easily bite through the material. The size of the ""hat"" portion is so small that I cannot put another hat inside. Not my best buy.Glenn"
2,"Fleisher's the whole show, I'm afraid","It's a bit baffling to find that this disc dates from 1996, since Leon Fleisher's well-publicized recovery from the dystonia that had severely weakened his right hand didn't occur until a few years ago. I think the secret is that he could attempt these very short piano accompaniments with rest in between. He achieves lovely, rather soft-grained playing with beautiful phrasing.Is that enough to salvage the singing of two artists in their sixties? I'm afraid not. Despite many touches of their former selves, both Shirley-Quirk and Bryn-Julson are understandably cautious, and both sound old, not to put too fine a point on it."
3,Does the job,"Bought this set for my son who says you need a good sturdy pair of boots to use the climbers. I thought the belt looked a little mediocre, but apparently it's tougher than it looks. Overall, does what he needs it to do."
3,Needs more padding and support,"I bought these to climb and top about 15-20 trees. They work great but the spurs sit low and apply a lot of pressure to your ankle making them uncomfortable after a while. The safety belt and lanyard is ok, but only being 1 3/4"" wide cuts into your sides and it could be a little longer (it's only 7'). So short term use just up and down there great, but not so for extended use."
3,Better if higher up,"The spikes worked well when climbing if you put them on at the tree. But if you have to walk a bit, the ground will dull the spikes, and it takes a little more effort to spear the tree for a solid foot hold."
1,terrible,"These things will kill you. I do not trust them. They hrt your ankle unless, I thought they would be good for a one time job and they are a waste."
1,A list of steps but no more,"This book walks through the features of Dreamweaver MX and shows some impressive things that others have done with it.I didn't see any discussion of design principles or techniques. In short, this was a complete waste. If you can't read on-line help, perhaps you will benefit. If you can and want to learn about website design using Dreamweaver, look elsewhere."
1,Sick Puppy,"Never has an author perennially engaged in such transparent self-aggrandizement to the extent of oddball Art Lee. When he tires of it, he tries to elevate his aberrant little partner Galen to hero status. [the worlds best two-weight angler].Gag me with a whitefish."
1,You'll hate it... or love it,"If you're the typical target audience of Putumayo and appreciate the label for bringing excellent lesser-known world musicians to the forefront, then you'll probably find these compilations offensive to the ear. Speaking as someone who adores Putumayo, I found this cd so bad that I felt I had to write a review to warn other Putumayo fans. That being said, if you're just interested in hearing some bizarre and quirky arrangements of popular songs, then you might like it. Do yourself a favor and if you think you might be interested in this album, go to Putumayo's website first and listen to the samples. You'll either love it or hate it."
1,Gets old PDQ!,"I used to work at a store in the mall, that often circulated several putumayo titles on our sound system which we also sold. We had Cuba, Samba Bossa Nova, Asian Groove, Arabic Groove, Zydeco, World Lounge, African Groove, Euro Lounge, Global Soul, just to name a few! I loved them all, even after listening to them every time I worked for almost a year...except one! Cover the world, drove me up the wall the first few times I heard it. Now, there are a few good songs on here (""Ain't no sunshine"", is my fav) but overall, not for long term listening in my opinion. Hearing Asian women sing ""No woman no cry"" gets flat out annoying after awhile! Would recommend the titles I stated above, over this one."
2,Good Idea but ....,"This could have been a good CD but there are just too many tracks that are too close to the originals eg Toto, Phil Collins to make it worthwhile. Hit the Road Jack swings and No Woman No cry is a good interpretation of the Marley song but other than that it plods along. There is just so much more interesting 'world' music out there to explore than this."
4,"Zwilich superb, the rest mediocre",I first heard the Zwilich trio a dozen or so years ago when the Kalichstein-Laredo-Robinson group played it in a series of inaugural performances. I was blown away by it. This disc is a pleasant reminder of that experience. This work is worth hearing if you have any interest at all in late-20th century serious Americal music.The other works are much less interesting. But the disc is worth the price simply for the Zwilich.
5,A great book by a great player,"This is perhaps the greatest tournament book ever written. Bronstein's his psychological insights into the thinking processes of strong GMs make this book a must-have for players of all strengths.In particular, players of sub-2200 rating will find this book a treasure and a careful study will certainly enhance your understanding of the game. For a creative and tactical genius, Bronstein does not weigh down the book with detailed variation analyses, but focusses on the broad thinking of positional and strategic matters.Kotov in his classic ""Think Like a Gramdmaster"" quotes freely from this book.The easy, conversational style of the annotations makes it a pleasure. Witness this (I am not quoting from memory here) - ""It is time to introduce the reader to the secret of the backward d6 pawn in the King's India Defence..."". The paragraph that follows is a deep insight into one of the fundamental positions of the KID.Buy this book. You will be much the better player for it."
5,"More than a Tournament Book, A Middle Game Book","If you were allowed to read but one book on your path to becoming a chess master, this would be it [In fact, a good friend of mine reached the 2200+ elo level having read only this chess book and Chess Life articles]. This book was written to be more than a series of annotations to the games of an excellent tournament but to be an all inclusive book on the game of chess. Focusing especially on the middle game, this book could also be entitled: David Bronstein on Chess, Using Examples from Zurich 1953. It could even be called: Middle Game Play Circa 1953. It is a truly marvelous book. Don't be stingy: Buy it!"
3,Good Games but sometimes analysis is hard to follow,"I like the games in this book. They are from some of the strongest players in one of the strongest tournaments. Though the analysis to the games seems accurate, I found that some times there was no explanation of things that I had a question about. And the analysis and ideas would lose me at times. Not all that clear."
5,Bronstein's admissions,"Many chess authorities consider this the best tournament book of all and they may be right. Bronstein, however, when asked about it noted that while he was responsible for the analysis, the text was largely written by someone named Vainstein. Mentioning that his feelings toward the Zurich tournament were mostly negative, he gave the impression that his estimate of the merits of this book were not quite so high as that of the reviewers. While it's comforting to see that this title remains readily available, I'd like to see it joined by Alekhine's efforts and Hastings 1895 perhaps."
4,One of the greatest chess tournaments!,"I liked going over the games in the book. They were very interesting and gave good instruction for the strategies. A very strong tournament with great players!!I would have given it 5 stars instead of four if the analysis of the games was written so a lower rated player could benefit. I am somewhat higher rated, and still had a few difficulties. But this book belongs in most libraries. I got Unbeatable Chess Lessons for Juniors which was written more for my level and very good. I also liked Logical Chess Move by Move."
5,A very good teaching chess book,"This book is about the best tournament of all time (in my opinion). It teaches players how to use their pieces, how to sacrifice to gain initiative, and many more things. It has some fascinating and beautiful positions I have ever seen. The author, David Bronstein, has made it clear what each player is trying to accomplish without doing in depth variation calculating. If you enjoy reading about chess history and how the chess world was shaped, or even just have a passion for great chess games, this would be a great book to read."
3,Good but needs to be in Algebraic Chess Notation,The games are good and so is the analysis of the games. There are a few mistakes I found and typos. But this book needs to not be in Descriptive notation and be changed over to Algebraic Chess Notation which is used nowadays.
3,Good games but book could be improved,"I enjoyed the games in this book. The annotations of the games are reasonably good (a few mistakes that I as a 1300 rated player found, tested on my computer, which agreed with me) though somewhat lacking in certain areas. The book uses a very long form of Algebraic notation, which is more difficult to read than the short form.Books on games that I like even more are 500 GAMES OF CHESS (by Tartakower and DuMont) and UNBEATABLE CHESS LESSONS FOR JUNIORS (by Snyder)."
1,A comprehensive collection of drivel,"I regret being the sole contrarian on the list of five-star reviews but feel compelled to give the book no more than one star. The essays are filled with platitudes and are marred with choppy writing & terrible grammar. Overall, the stories have the content of a 3rd grade essay assignment.Perhaps there is a theme to the compendium but it is gleaned at a most painful use of one's time."
5,Wonderful and Refreshing,"This is a wonderful CD of Baroque music from 17th Century Italy. I enjoyed many of the pieces including Sonata De Basso Solo performed by Gregorio Strozzi.The music was refreshingly different from the ""ordinarily wonderful"" Baroque I listen to. This collection is truly worth the purchase."
3,Good replacment,"This replaced my old Canon i560 printer. Considering the basic functions of that printer compared to this one I am blown out of the water. It prints quickly and has not smeared or destroyed any documents yet. I have a few complaints though. The printer requires a ink wasting test page every time you load paper or install new ink. The ink is more expensive than the Canon ink but it lasts longer. I cannot get this printer to work wirelessly though my desktop. The scanner quality is average at best. All in all, considering my old printer was printing in blue only for awhile, this printer makes me a happy camper. I will defiantly buy a Lexmark again."
3,decent printer,"This is a good printer. It does everything that it is supposed to to do. HOWEVER: it constantly emits a high pitched ""eeeeeeee"" sound. even when it is turned off you still here this annoying sound. it takes a while to get used to."
2,Huge Missed Opportunity: DVD Review,"This is a 5 star movie, but only a 2 star DVD.This DVD could have been just amazing, but it is completely bare, not a single extra to be had. If only it had an audio commentary or a good retrospective documentary on the making of the film. This is one of those films that Criterion should get a hold of and really treat right, it's a classic.It's a big missed opportunity to me, such a shame. Hopefully it will be corrected with Blu-ray"
