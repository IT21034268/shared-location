3,Un sac de billes.,"The story is about two young boys : Joe and Maurice, they are French and Jews, it's in Paris during world War 2. So they must avoid. they went to the south, near the Italian border.The story is touching and well writing, but sometimes it's very boring, because there isn't a lot of action."
5,FUN TO READ BOOK,TO ALL ENOY THE BOOK. HE STARTED TO ANSWER SOME ONE WINGMAN QUESTIONS. I ALSO ENOJYED HOW HE UPDATED THE BOOK WITH CURRENT EVENTS FROM ARE TIME. MACK WHEN WILL THE NEXT BOOK BE OUT.
2,Choppy Formatting,"I just received my new Kindle and am learning how to use it. I ""bought"" War and Peace as it was free just to see how it appeared. I read the book years ago and thought it would be handy to have on the Kindle to dip into. I find the spacing is off. It seems to be grouped in blocks of lines that don't scroll to the end of the line. The line stops halfway across the page and one or two words appear in the next line. I tried various adjustment and font changes but the problem persists. It is still readable, but disconcerting. I bought another, more recent book and it does not have the same problem. Dp others have this problem; any solutions?"
2,"No xray!,,","Reading that the book is ""best navigation,"" i downloaded YET ANOTHER copy of this book, only to find that it, like all of the other copies, lacks XRAY, which is the only reason one would purchase ""best navigation,"" therefore, once again, it falls very short."
4,enjoyed it,I thought this book was some good light reading. would have enjoyed a little more in depth exploration of the main protagonists.
1,Pages missing from my purchased edition.,Any company selling supposedly high quality high brow novels at least should hire someone to make sure all the pages are there. In Book 11 of this novel of my purchase (not with Amazon and in store plastic wrapped) pages 727 through 758 are simply not there. Second edition too. If purchasing make sure your edition has no similar errors or it will be a headache. I found out after my receipt was lost and decided to keep it on account of the commentary in the back and perhaps some undiscovered goodies. If this happens again it will be Dosvidanya to Norton.
1,MISSING PAGES,"I would like to give a review of this book, unfortunately while reading I realized there was over 50 pages missing. Since this book is about 1400 pages it took me a while to get to the point in the book where the pages were missing and now it is past the return period."
2,Not the Briggs translation,"This is a review of the Kindle edition, not the novel itself. The Amazon page indicates it is the newer Briggs translation. Actually it is the Maude translation from 1920. The Maude translation however is very good and would make this well worth downloading except for one unfortunate thing: the notes have not been hypertexted. I'm afraid that kind of puts the Wordsworth Classics into the ""not interested"" bin for me. If notes are included, make them accessible!"
2,not what I ordered; binding has no words; inside text in modern font,"I have resolved to ""read the classics"" this year. I've read or am reading Jane Austen's Mansfield Park, and Dickens' Little Doritt, Great Expectations, and David Copperfield. Next will be Moby Dick, and then War and Peace. I was disappointed to open the box with War and Peace inside, to find a blue binding with no identifying marks. And inside an unappealing modern font which looks to me like it was computer-generated and not type set. It appears to have been bound in a home publishing set up. On the title page, it says ""Lits[copyright symbol]2010"". This is not what I saw when I ordered the book."
3,Not what I expected,"Picked this cd up after reading in some AVS forums about the enhanced digital mastering of this cd to do a blind audio test. Can't say I dig the music, or appreciate the 'better quality' though.Interesting album coverart."
4,Classic,"Classic tennis shoe. Love the look. Flat sole, logo not too big, style not too flashy. They don't look like the walking shoes you see on the seniors making a trip around the mall, or trying to impress everyone with what you're wearing. They were a little tight at the ankle initially, but this was just the break-in. I normally wear 9 to 9 1/2, and sized up to a 10 for these with no problem. Plenty of grip, but the arch support feels like less than others. Great all-around shoe!"
2,Also missing blanket,"Like other reviwers have mentioned, our kit came with only water and food but NO blanket. The water and food does have a long expiration date (8/2016) though. Even though the blanket is rather cheap (< $1), I am surpised at the lack of QA on the packaging. It would be a problem if people are depending on it during an emergency (that's why we buy these kits?)"
4,Quake kit,"I havent used this yet as it was purchased for our emergency kit (so I hope to never use it) but, it seems to be good quality and true to description."
4,Exactly as described. Fast shipper!,I feel safer knowing I have the minimum recommended amount of survival supplies on hand.
1,Expired item,"I just recieved this to upgrade my car kit. The box was damaged in transit, which I didn't think was going to be a problem, but when I opened it up, I discovered that one of the water pouches was empty (due to the shipping damage?). Then I discovered that the empty pouch was the only one with an extended expiration date: the other 5 pounchs all expired 3/2010. I have returned it for replacement; I'll have to see if the replacement is in better condition."
4,Nice starter or car kit,"This is a nice basic kit, with all the basics you need for a few days. I gave these as gifts to family and friends to promote awareness of being prepared. Only problem was that one of the water containers was broke and had leaked."
3,Just Okay,"The bar is a 2400 cal bar. So not sure if that is really enough for 3 days. I think you can build this for about the same price or cheaper but get a 3600 cal Mainstay bar. The box isn't really the best either. Just regular cardboard. I would recommend you build a ""survival"" kit yourself instead of buying this."
5,Good kit for the car!,"I ordered 2 of these kits for my wife's vehicle and they are exactly what I was looking for. Each kit comes with (6)Six pouches filled with water, (1)One 2400 calorie meal bar(that is vacuumed sealed), and a mylar blanket. Expiration date on both kits showing January 2017(This review was made in July 2012)The meal bar is a Datrex 2400F bar, the overall approximate size is 4"" wide, 2"" thick, and 3"" high. It is packaged in a very sturdy mylar bag that is vacuum sealed. This meal bar contains 12 smaller bars/rations(200 calories each) that are to be consumed every 6 hours (Giving you 800 calories a day)and has enough to supply one person for 3 days.Overall, its a good kit with the basics... For the price, I plan on ordering a few more in the near future."
1,Overpriced! you can get it at Big 5 for less than this $,Overpriced!! You can get this at big 5 for less half of the price! Junk!
4,Pepe,I remember seeing this movie when I was growing up. I've only been able to find this film on VHS only in Spanish. I would like to beable to find one in English. If anyone can help me I would appreciate it.
4,Back to the basics of song and dance and comedy,"Recently saw this movie on cable encore. wonderful music, dancing and comedy. Cantiflas the sidekick in Around the World, probably Shirley Jones first, Dan Daley always good. The movie is full of cameos by the ""Rat Pack"" Sinatra et al. 1961 issue but they don't make them like this anymore, unfotunately. Almost 2 hrs of sheer deligful entertainment. ."
1,Keep your money instead of buying this book!!,Survival Bartering is a very elementary book. Everything contained in its covers should already be common knowledge and common sense..The best survival bartering you can do is to KEEP YOUR MONEY and buy something else!
2,needs lots of explanation for people who don't sign,"Our daughter uses ASL to communicate and I bought this book for her nurses, thinking that it would give them some basic vocabulary to use with her. The pictures are very basic and it is hard to understand what kind of movement is going on. There are no written explanations for performing each movement. This makes it difficult for someone to know if the sign is correct. (Not important if you are using signs short term, but important in our case.) I highly recommend the Signing Time video series. Lots of very useful signs and the videos are just as interesting as Elmo or Barney to our daughter!"
3,An Interesting Look at Societal Change,"A book about the demographics of Canadians? Although the title doesn't immediately suggest it, that is what Sex in the Snow is all about. Michael Adams has delineated the divisions of modern Canadian society into three generational groups and a dozen ""social values tribes."" What makes the book especially interesting is the way he highlights connections and tensions between the various tribes and then extrapolates what it all means to Canadian society. The central message is that ""demography is no longer destiny,"" that the contribution/influence of any group or tribe is not intrinsically tied to their numbers, and that self-determination and self-identification plays a powerful role in constructing society. Although the thrust of the book is Canadian demographics, those south of the border will find the comparison between Canadians and their counterparts in the U.S. quite enlightening, too."
4,Excellent mix of house and african music,"If you liked Cheb I Sabbah's ""La Kahena"" you'll probably dig this too."
3,Diamond Willow sticks,"I bought three of these walking sticks in hopes of making canes. Unfortunately the sticks were quite large in diameter for what I needed. I was able to get one to work for me, but the other two are just too large. I could strip them down to a smaller size, but I would remove most or all of the diamonds and bark, and it would look just like another stick. It would be nice if they would offer a smaller version just for canes."
2,Not too good,"I wanted a diamond willow walking stick to carve like I used to do in Alaska. The stick arrived promptly, but there were hardly any burls to carve around . Just straight willow, very boring."
1,Treeline surpassed my expectations with the stick I received,I ordered a stick and and was surprised by the the quality of the service and the stick . I will be ordering more sticks from Treeline in the future. Amazon has now and in the past has provided nothing but the best product and service.
3,Difficult but worth while,"Well this was my first Charles Dickens book. I found it difficult at times to read, a lot of flowery descriptions and some English expressions I wasn't familiar with. BUT, I did enjoy reading it and found the characters interesting. I found some of the events that happened were to coincidental, but then again that's how the author brings some zest to the story. This book is long. I did appreciate Modern Library Classics little extra touches like discussion points, even the front of the books art work is nice."
3,a bit slow for such a thick book,"I am a fairly well-read individual who (in my opinion) really enjoys a well written work. I had never read David Copperfield and decided to read it because I was looking to gain a better understanding of England's culture of the day - and the praise it receives made it hard to resist. I suppose I did get a well-rounded picture of the time period through this and Oliver Twist combined, but I would have preferred to do so through a much thinner book. The story was simply the ups and downs of David Copperfield's ""ordinary"" life. In my opinion, it was not exceptionally written."
2,Jester's hat please....,"This David Copperfield is given more breaks than any two China Shops with the proverbial BULL !!!Granted he gets his share of treachery as a child, but all the swindling in the world would not teach this fool to run from a madman swinging an Ax.Truly - everything he loves perishes - everyone who is kind to him suffers misey - and it is 500 pages of frustration waiting for the boy to grow a backbone or at least to learn from his mistakes or the mistakes of the many fantastic personalities that surround him.It is confounding to say the least, when a stable boy outwits him out of the life for which he is destined. (or does he?)I feel like a hard hearted wench, but the hardships he endures after the age of 10 are not only deserved they are well earned.And any clever insights gained in the end bring little comfort for having read an excess of 500 pages.Dickens however does great justice to the characters the voices and the personalities of the far ranging characters he invents."
5,My favorite book!!!!,"I really love this book, I cried, and laughed with it a lot, I have read it at least three times, I always read a Dicken's book if I can find one, and that it's hard in Mexico, althought I have read eight of them, and I can say that this one is the best"
5,I think it is the best book by C.Dickens!,"This is a story about life of David Copperfield . C.Dickens`s ""D.C."" is his own biography,when he showed us the life of David,his opinions about the world , he(C.Dickens) showed us his childhood."
4,Good Book,"I found this book to be so much easier to read than Great Expectations. This novel, set in Victorian England, details the life of David Copperfield, a young boy who suffers many hardships in his life. These include a dominating stepfather, the death of his mother, and his homelessness. Since the book contains several mini-plots you are not bored with the same subject throughout the whole book. There are also many interesting characters in the book that contribute to the mood, humor, tragedy, and life of David Coppefield."
2,Poor print quality for the price,"For the price of the Everyman edition, one would expect the pages to be cleanly printed. Instead, the letters are faded and weak on many pages. On many pages, parts of some letters are missing altogether."
5,Great book,David Copperfield is worth reading and re-reading. It is great fun to cheer the heroes and boo the bad guys. The plot ties up neatly in the end.
2,Dickens' magic is sporadic,"Although Dickens may have liked this book best, it doesn't come close to Hard Times, Christmas Carol, or Tale of Two Cities. David Copperfield drags. The first few chapters were interesting--and the characters of Mr.Dick, Betsey Trotwood, and Uriah Heep are priceless--but skip the rest and move on to some truly GREAT works! Dickens has plenty from which to choose."
2,One of the secondary novels of a great 19th century novelist,"David Copperfield is one of the least memorable of the dickens novels. It is NOT the first Dickens novel you should read, but if you enjoyed his other works, then this should satisfy your Dickens fix."
5,great,Great Perfect great unbeilievable person love the book love charles dickins arrived on time will buy again and again wow
4,Very Pleased to Have Read David Copperfield,"This is the third Dickens novel that I have read (Great Expectations and A Tale of Two Cities being the others). Copperfield's story hit on the full range of emotions. You'll find yourself turning each page saying, ""what is going to happen to this kid next?"" Dickens finds a way to introduce over 30 major characters, each of which is a little more interesting than our hero. He ties up all of his loose ends and the result is a 64 chapter book that leaves your appetite for a good classic very satisfied. If you are trying to decide which Dickens to read first, Great Expectations would be a better pick, but once you have read that 5* classic you should be ready to spend a few weeks getting to know Copperfield and his friends."
5,One of my all-time favorite books,"I love to read new books, but there are 3 or 4 books that I read over and over and are like dear friends to me. ""David Copperfield"" is one of them. Yes, I relish the engaging plot but it is Dickens' characters that I adore. Who can resist Aunt Betsey (who was initially disappointed that David was a boy because she planned on naming a niece after herself - ""Your sister Betsey Trotwood would have told me what she thought of any one, directly. Be as like your sister as you can, and speak out !"" Never mind that David never did have a sister, you know what she means.) There is the verbose but endearing Mr. Micawber who constantly struggled with finances, but was always certain that ""Something would turn up."" And the villainous, Uriah Heep is masterfully described in all his writhing, false humility. The list goes on and on. If you'd like an introduction to Dickens' writing, this is the novel I would recommend. I hope this book becomes your friend as well."
2,Victorian Trash,"A potentially exciting tale of a young mans trials through life, which is ruined by oversentimentality. I found the characters very thin, and lacking in comic relief- with the notable exception of Betsey Trotwood and Uriah Heep. The plot itself is unimaginative with a very predictable ending. As a female reader, one of my dislikes of this book is the unmemorable female characters, who are either weak or full of undying patience and gratitude. If you are looking for a book to put you to sleep at bedtime - this one's for you!"
1,David copper field,This is a very boring story. Pale. Nonsense. Unable to complete the reading. Don't recommend anyone to spend time on this
3,This is a novel?,"I am trying to read the world's greatest novels as found on internet lists. David Copperfield seems to be less of a novel than a long series of episodes that are thinly related to each other. Few of the episodes propel the plot forward. I know that Dickens wrote serially for magazines and it shows. Many of the characters seem like two dimensional caricatures rather than real human beings. The plots seems melodramatic. Still, Dickens can write movingly. I don't think that this is a great novel but it is readable and allows some good insight into what Victorian England was like."
2,It's an OKAY book,i thought that this book was a little boring but also i'm a teenager and am not really into this kind of stuff to read. i gave it two stars though becasue i thought that some of it was funny and made me like the book more. i think what makes me dislike the book was that it was really long and at a lot of times didn't make sense! Also i have to do a lot of school work with this book and don't like that! but other wise the book was okay.
3,"David Copperfield, The Modern Library Classics","I love the soft cover feel and introduction, but the cost is too much for this classic."
5,dickens,whats not to like?? dickens? digital copy you can take anywhere?:)i love this book!!if you never tried dickens before' start with this one.
4,"A wonderful story, engagingly told","I suspect that hearing this book read to me (I think from Audible.com) made all the difference.Dickens takes you right inside a fascinating, vivid character and surrounds you with a compelling world and cast of friends, acquaintances, and enemies. Master Copperfield is a marvelous story teller, who carries you along.Compared with Middlemarch, Dickens has most of Eliot's psychological penetration but a more melodramatic, less realistic approach. For the most part, this was not a major weakness, although at times it was; for instance, the romantic conclusion lacked much of the persuasive reality of the the rest of the story.I suppose Dickens wrote each chapter as a separately published magazine piece, which sometimes gives the story an uncertain rhythm.Overall, I enjoyed almost every minute with Master Copperfield and look forward to taking the voyage with him again some day."
4,Well written but long and tedius,"David Copperfield isn't the easiest book to get through, but it has nothing to do with being hard to follow. Unlike the reviewer who notes that there are a lot of flowery descriptions and some English expressions they weren't familiar with, I found no expressions I didn't understand and am curious to know what ""flowery descriptions"" might mean to the reviewer as I am at a loss as to where they might be found in the book. The only reason I have for saying the book is hard to get through is because unless you find yourself connecting with Copperfield on a personal level, reading every detail of his life story (from birth on) could turn into quite a drag.That said, the book is not all boring in fact within it's pages I stumbled upon the BEST most well written, hilarious and accurate scene of a drunken stupor I've yet to read, and THAT my friends makes it all worth while in the end."
5,my favorite Dickens,"I tried Dickens a few times in my life, but I didn't really ""get"" him until I was in my 40's (I'm another decade along, now. . .). David Copperfield is my favorite Dickens novel (followed closely by Nicholas Nickleby). I've read 5 of his novels, and it's great to know that there are many more to be enjoyed.Others have pointed out that the title character of Dickens' novels is usually less interesting than the characters surrounding him. I agree: David is mostly a passive, naieve boy/young man, who learns about the world from the generous, selfish, moody, funny, deluded people that he encounters.I think we love Dickens because he understands that, deep down, most of us never stop feeling like David (regardless of how old and ""wise"" we have become).Was this review helpful to you?"
5,Classic,"I remember reading this many years ago. This may not appeal to people who do not like 'old-fashioned writing', and yes, this book is different than many of the 'easy' novels you will find today, it is still a solid and die-hard classic with a cast of good characters and a story with enough twists and turns to keep it good. Charles Dickens wrote many fine books, and this is definitely one of them."
4,I'm not finished yet.. but...,"I have not finished the book yet, but I've been asked to review it.. Wow, how can I quickly do a review of Dickens favorite, almost biographical book that hasn't been said before. I'm not going to do that. Just that it's one of the highlites of literature. As for the book format on my kindle reader, it's quite excellent."
4,"Great Value for the price, cat wouldn't eat it though :(","I was very hopeful for this cat food, since I have been using Hill's Science Diet Oral Care to control my cats teeth and breath.This cat food does have the larger ball shapes which forces them to chew down on it to clean the teeth. However, my cat was not a big fan of the taste. As soon as I would put it out, he would smell it a little, and walk away, only eating it later in the day when he figured this was going to be his only food. Maybe if I gave him more time, he wouldn't mind soo much but after a week he still wouldn't eat it at first.This is most likely due in part of him getting used to the Hill's Science Diet quality of food, which is alot much more pricey than this food. However, my cat ABSOLUTELY LOVES the Hill's Science Diet food and goes nuts when he knows I'm getting it out.This cat food will work for your cat's oral healthcare and the price is great!"
5,My cats forced me to the Internet to find it!,"When the last shop in my area stopped carrying Dental Diet, and the dish where it usually was placed sat empty, my kitties mourned. So I went fishing here on the Internet and found it at my favorite store, Amazon. Thanks Big A! I have one cat, a Himalayan, who will eat very little else, and he is aged and very slender. Another cat poaches from next door whenever he can. And my other 2 cats will never have dental work done again, I have sworn (unless an emergence like an abscess,) because(a) they suffer so after the anesthesia and(b) the Dental Diet rollies really do work.Order loads of these goodies, actually one could use them as treats!Friskies, your Marketing Department has fallen on its backside. This is a good product. Get out there and sell it!"
5,Swear by the stuff!,"Before I began using this as my four cats' only food, the annual dental bill ($200 each), not to mention the stress of the vet visit and anesthesia on both them and me was too much. This is the primary food, except for a special treat now and then, for all of them now and none have needed a dental cleaning in five years!They all like it just fine, and one of them even prefers to have a bit more of an adventure and serve himself right through the unopened bag if I don't make sure it's in a closed cabinet. (Even when there's some in the dish - must be a real do-it-yourselfer!)As another reviewer mentioned it's been getting more difficult to find in the grocery stores - don't know why - it's great. With multiple cats, the larger bag is even more useful. Used to be I had a hard time finding the 6.3 lb bag, but lately, some of my local stores don't even have the smaller sizes.So psyched to find it here -- thanks, Amazon!"
3,Cats wouldn't touch it,"That said, I guess it depends on your cat's taste. I desperately tried to get our cats to eat this stuff but the pellets are fairly large, so I think they hurt their mouths when they tried to eat them (one is a Persian and they typically have smaller mouths than most cats). Our ""Tom"" cat didn't care for it either for some reason. So, since we couldn't get past the taste in our house, the dental portion didn't work. Sure wish it did though. That $200 teeth cleaning bill yearly is quite ridiculous! Good luck with this but I guess it's just like any other food for cats. Try it because it is a GREAT idea but ultimately, it will be up to your cat if he/she decides to eat it."
2,not what I thought,"I should have spent a few dollars more and gone with the furry one. This one is disappointing and although it has bean bag type sides, not as comfortable."
3,a tad bulky but does the job,i got this for a friend but it was a tad bulky for her taste. it works.
3,Slips,"I think for the price, you can do better. Go to your local auto parts store and get one cheaper. I bought the leather one, but after using it, a cloth one would do the job just as well as the leather one. Actually the leather one makes my shoulder sweaty after awhile.It needs to be longer or it needs someting to keep it in place, as it slips down and I have to constantly re-adjust as I'm driving. Overall, it does what it is supposed to do I guess."
5,Super soft and safe,"My friend in Thailand had a small car accident. Everything was fine except the big scratch from seatbelt on her neck and shoulder, which took long long time to be healed. I think it's a must to have shoulder pad while driving. This product is very very soft on my skin. I always wear tank top. Sometimes the pad slides onto my arm or chest. I love the feeling. Strongly recommended."
1,Worked well for about a year,"I bought this scale from Bed Bath & Beyond. It worked very accurately for about 1.5 yrs. and I did love the memory function. Lately it started showing the ERR sign every time I stepped on. Instructions said to reset it which I did. But when I'd weigh myself it would be off by quite a bit. Each day it got worse until it wouldn't read anything but ERR. I replaced the battery and it wouldn't turn on at all. I put the old battery back in and still won't come on. It seems to be completely dead. If I thought buying a new one would mean 1.5 more years of accurate use I would do it but after reading the other reviews here where some scales didn't work from the start, I will try a different brand."
1,Totally worthless! How can they still be allowed to sell these?,"First off, I wish I could give this scale a ZERO star rating. I bought this scale for its features and large, strong platform. I've had it for less than 24hrs and I'm taking it back. I've weighed myself about 15 times, and each time I was given a different weight. I've owned other scales, so I know that foot placement, surface, and movement, is important. Nothing helped. So aside from from a different weight everytime, now its decided to start displaying the too much weight for scale ""EE"" reading every time I step on it. I weight 230lbs, and the limit is 400lbs. So this scale is just plain crappy. After reading other reviews from people saying the exact same thing, I'm not going to waste my time calling Homedics for help. What I will do, is complain to Bed Bath and Beyond for carrying this piece of crap in their stores.Do not waste your money on this scale!"
1,Inconsistent and inaccurate,"I've had it about a week. It gives different measurements within a single minute. It has told me I weigh the same with or without clothes on. (The clothes weigh 600g according to my kitchen scales.)The BMI and user features are good (i.e. it remembers your last weight, for up to four people), but it fails to do the basics: tell you what you actually weigh!"
1,Another piece of Chinese crap...,"Just bought this peice of crap because I returned a Taylor unit. Both made in China, both pieces of crap that vary 20 pounds at a time."
3,It's not bad.,"Hot girls Sasha Singleton, Flo Jalin, and Miss Becky head up this DVD. The DVD follows the models through random activities like rollerblading, talking at a diner, dancing at a club, etc. The video was excellently produced. The graphics are excellent. The video really has no point other than to showcase these hot babes in the smallest of clothing. There is no complete nudity in this video which kind of disappointed me. There is a scene where Flo Jalin is having a bikini airbrused on her naked body, but the good stuf is blurred. It's not a bad video at all, but if this will become a series, I would hope they do include more nudity."
4,This is a great CD for all you lovers out there!!!!!!!,This is a great single featuring Roger Troutman and Mister Niles. We have had the pleasure of listening to Wendal Brown full album and we think it was one the best albums of '98 and '99. This is the kind of music we would love to here on the radio more. We're telling you that this brother is going to be hot for the millenium!!!
5,Rings true ...,"This book is as funny as it is true. If you've spent any time selling, you'll find yourself giggling in one moment and slapping yourself on the forehead in the next. Duncan's anecdotes and admonitions ring true and his advice is generally simple to implement. Worth the read."
5,"Their best was in the 80s, but this is good Southern Rock","This is quite possibly the best of the 90's, but I wish Amazon had ""Doc Holliday Rides Again"", which is their best album (IMHO). My 5 stars would have been 3.5 stars, but with an arguably unfair 1 star rating out there (rating attitude rather than the music), I'm just pulling up the score to a still light 3 stars."
1,where's rick,"ok ego riders. why did you leave rick skelton off the cover. he has as much to do with your sound as anyone. ok bruce maybe not you.still do what's right or don't do it. oh by the way, the music is cool, but the one star is for attitude (yours)"
5,One of the best books for people with fibromyalgia,"This book and Dr. St. Amand's other book, What Your Doctor May Not Tell YouAbout Fibromyalgia, have changed the quality of my life for the better.I strongly recommend both books for anyone diagnosed with Fibromyalgia.I went from a low quality of life, before the books, to a high quality almost normal life, after the books. To benefit from the suggested information a person must follow all of the advice given and not pick and choose. To learn more about Dr. St. Amand,his protocol and diet for fibromyalgia visit his website."
5,WARNING!!!!!,"If you plan on buying this book, you can get it direct from Ciaffone himself for $16 plus shipping and he will sign it too.Don't pay these other scabs their inflated prices!!!!!!"
3,Steely Dan's dissapointing album,"At first look at the tracks many people would say ""This is the album with Babylon Sisters and Hey Nineteen, and the rest is just filler."" Well, I kind of have to agree with them.Don't get me wrong though, ""Gaucho"" is the epic track on the album and it's not that bad. Plus, it has ""Time Out of Mind"" and ""Third World Man"" which are decent tracks that were featured on the Show Biz Kids compilation."
3,NOT THEIR BEST,"I REALLY ENJOYED THIS EFFORT BY STEELY DAN. THIS, TO ME, IS A FAR CRY FROM THEIR BETTER STUFF(RECALL COUNTDOWN TO ECSTACY AND PREZTEL LOGIC), BUT IT STILL HAS SOME VERY ENJOYABLE SONGS. A SONG I PARTICULARLY LOVE IS 3RD WORLD MAN, WHICH I GOT TO LISTEN TO LIVE ON THEIR CD ALIVE IN AMERICA. THE TITLE CUT IS EXCELLENT, TOO."
2,"Steely Dan, Neutered","Basically, this album is a tame version of all the classic Steely Dan albums. Stick to ""Katy Lied,"" ""Aja,"" ""Can't Buy a Thrill;"" really any Dan album save for this one. No teeth, no edge... just smooth, adult contemporary radio fare."
2,Everything that made Aja great...,"...makes Gaucho unbearable. Both Aja and Gaucho have excellent studio production and should be studied by audio engineers (I know I test out stereos using Steely Dan albums). But the perfectionism that makes Aja so vibrant makes Gaucho seem lifeless by comparison. There are exceptions, I found Time Out of Mind and Hey Nineteen to be as good as anything on Aja. But ultimately they are just that, exceptions to the normally bland material. The only reason I bought this album was to complete my Steely Dan collection; and the only other reason to buy it, Hey Nineteen, is on Classic Rock radio enough that you don't have to spend the money to buy the rest of the album."
3,because,"nobody else gave it 3 stars- take this for what its worth Ive listened to this at least a half dozen times, couldnt tell you 1 song on it, but after a day of working in hell I enjoyed putting it on and relaxing"
1,Making sure they wouldn't be missed,"Anyone who objects to describing this mess as elevator muzak has no defense - the sad fact is that Gaucho is playing in elevators and restrooms around the world at this very moment!Where to begin? The backup singing is absolutely atrocious, the piano tinkling so lame you find yourself swallowing hard to keep from vomiting, and the list goes on and on. Mark Knopfler was apparently in the studio for one song but the only evidence of it is the song credits. To top it off, this CD finally concludes the series of new liner notes by Becker and Fagen written for the re-mastered discs. Following the trend from the previous CDs, these notes are pretentious, uninformative, and too cute by several orders of magnitude.Thanks to Aja and Gaucho, few in the late 80's or 90's bothered to wonder where Steely Dan had disappeared to - the concensus was that if this was all they had to offer then thanks for the first five albums and so long - it's been good to know ya."
2,Going Down?,"This is the worst Steely Dan Album. Period.Babylon Sisters is a great opener, but the rest of the album can be heard playing on elevators everywhere....Overly polished and stale sounding overall.Don't Bother."
2,not a dvd,Great music.... cant be beat....... not a dvd..... just looks like the back of an album cover with the song listings... and i cannot burn the songs.... a dvd should show the band performing......period......
5,A classic,"Jazz, rock, pure transcendent bliss...the Dan tell stories in their unique way, little tone poems of startling insights, bodacious cowboys, Szechuan dumplings, direct from Lhasa. If forced to take only one CD to a desert island, this would be the one. Buy it now!"
5,Drive west on Sunset,"This is another album of timeless music. Must be heard on a killer system to appreciate all the fine points, vocal harmonies etc. Try to listen to it whilst driving west on Sunset- LA decadence and drugs (Not an endorsement by this writer!) is what inspired Gaucho. Two thumbs way up."
3,Sounds great ; material just ok...,"This DTS recording is a worthwhile purchase. But it is definitely not their best work. 2 or 3 good tracks and several other mediocre ones; (and its a short album too!) Some of the playing seems too restrained. Specifically, the drums and percussion tend to be very uninspired. (Its clear who's the boss and who's the hired hand)But the sound is tremendously clear and crisp! The 5 channel mix tends to put the horn sections and backup vocals in the rear channels and the main instruments up front. nothing too radical, but it works fine fro this music.Since there aren't a lot of DTS albums yet, I'd say buy this one if you want to hear how good DTS can sound. I wish all music was available in this format"
5,Might be their best album!,"If you can only buy one Steely Dan disc, well this might be the one. As always, the muscians are top shelf and the production is state of the art! Third World Man is becoming one of my all time favorite songs."
4,Really Good Album,"I have this Disc&I still enjoy Bumping the Grooves of ""Glamour Profession""&Time Out of Mind.those Jams are so cool when I'm riding my Bike in the wind of Spring or the Warmth of Summer time.the title cut has a interesting Chant thing quality about it for me.I dig the Vibe of ""Hey Nineteen"".there Trademark Sound&Vibe is all over here.Fagen&Becker made a Really Cool Album here."
5,The zenith of Steely Dan's star.,"For those who thought it impossible, this CD is the cherry on top of Aja. Each cut is a tasty little world unto itself; each compelling in its own flavor; each tied to the rest by its pungent reflection of the times in which we live. The guitar in particular, both rhythm and solo, are so pristine (we're able to hear picks across strings especially well on Glamour Profession and My Rival) and well conceived as to be fascinating. None but Donald Fagen's voice would fit so perfectly. Gaucho is Steely Dan at its zenith. Sublime! This is the pop CD I'd put in a time capsule as a gift to future listeners."
5,Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs - Gaucho Steely Dan Superb Sound,The attached is arguably the best CD Steely Dan completed prior to their breakup or since.This is the Mobile Fidelity 24Karat Gold Version in the orignial shrink wrap.A truly outstanding piece of jazz inflected rock/pop that is simply hard to beat if you are a fan. The sound is superb thanks to MFSL technology and remastering and ranks right up there with the Super Audio Version on the SACD Layer.This item is a collectible and you may find it periodically on Ebay for significantly more money and in U.S. $'s.
2,Waste of money,"This 180 gram vinyl reissue was made from the digital master they use to make the CD's. It sounds just like the CD, dull and flat. All the imperfections from the CD are on here also. On Time Out Of Mind the sound drops out in several spots just like the CD. If you want this LP just hunt down an original pressing from 1980. Don't waste your money like I did. Its sad because this is one the greatest albums ever."
5,Best surround disc I own!,"if you have a surround sound setup and Super Audio player,do yourself a favor and purchase this Hybrid SACD of Gaucho.Not only is the original recording hi-fi, but the surround mix is thoughtful, daring, dynamic, and balanced.i've heard many albums done well in surround (The Who's Tommy, Roxy Music's Avalon), but this one is the best sounding.i find myself listening to this a lot."
2,Great Production! Bland Material!,"This album finds the dynamic duo of Becker and Fagen putting out a bad album(gasp)!!!!!!!! Yes it is unfortunately true. This record has immaculate production (like Aja). Gaucho, like Aja, has great wordplay, excellent arrangements, and top notch players, but something is missing! Fagen sings like he's bored and most of the songs go on and on with nothing even remotely memorable in the music. 'Hey nineteen' (one of the Dan's best) is the exception to the rule. But the rest is just plain boring. Oh well, I am willing to forgive Becker and Fagen because they have given us so many other great album's like 'Pretzel Logic', 'Aja', and 'Countdown to Ecstasy'."
3,The sonic segregation of Steely Dan,"While Dolby Digital and DTS can create intensely accurate sound-staging for motion pictures, I don't necessarily believe we're to the point of accepting 5.1 channel music, just yet. My initial hopes for this disc were pretty much dashed by the intentional 'scattering' of the musicians between the five full-range channels. It's somewhat disconcerting to abruptly have female backing vocals blurt out behind you from nowhere; and the idea of placing primary guitar parts in the rear channels is absurd. The bass extension on this disc is incredible, bordering on ridiculous. The team that's responsible for re-mixing this obviously loves 'boom-car' bass....it's simply too loud, compared with the rest of the mix. It's easily possible to wrangle it under control with a tweak of the bass management controls on the receiver....my point being: you shouldn't have to. All said, it IS an interesting treatment of the tracks.....worth owning, only if you're a die-hard Dan Fan."
3,SACD = new remix,"First of all I need to say that I am commenting on this particular mix and not the performance. I have the original CD and I have the Mobile Fidelity with it's remix. This new SACD is a totally different mix altogether and I must say I am not impressed. Gaucho is a great album make no mistake but so much of the intent of the original mix has been violated. Fagen's voice is now in front of the speakers and very dry (no reverb at all). At one point in Babylon Sisters, a very subtle vocal aside has become an in-your-face ""squeal"" of sorts. It's actually humorous. The drums are much more impressive than the 44.1 version but that's about all that's better. I was really hoping that the SACD version would be as fantastic as we were led to believe but sadly it isn't. Try and find a copy of the MFSL version. It's by far the best."
5,gaucho is fantastic,"5.1 surround sound cd is great, met or exceeded my expactations. Wish I could find some more Steely Dan of the 5.1 surround sound quality!"
1,not what I expected,This item had nice tools but the wood seemed very cheap. Drawer slid in and out too easily. Seemed flimsy.
4,Great for the RV,Cutlery worked well even though on the small side. Easy to clean. Easy to store. Practical item which doesnt take up much room.
4,A Good Compilation CD,"Some of this stuff I already have on other CDs in my collection but this is an excellent sampler for fans of chill-out music. Along with the now overplayed ""Here With Me"" by Dido, there are some real gems on this CD set, something for everybody."
1,Big Mistake,"Did I make a big mistake. I bought the robe as a birthday present. My sister did not want it because it was the wrong style and the wrong color. I sent it back, and now I'm only getting $37.00 back when I paid $47.00. Besides I paid $9.00 for shipping when I received it, and $10.00 shipping when I sent it back.What does that mean. It had hardly been taken from the plastic bag because she saw immediately it wasn't what she wanted.How can a company reduce the refund by that much? Altogether it cost me $66.00, and I'm receiving a credit card refund of $37.00.I disgusted and am a lot smarter now. No more ordering from Amazon or from their website."
1,This was an affront to women..do not rent this film!,Not only did this film truly have a stupid plot and low grade 'actors'. It continued to assault the viewer with its derogatory view of women. I don't mind watching mindless B movies but I want my money back on this one. It was insulting. I hope the cameraman got his rocks off on all the ass shots.
5,"Not Just a Recipe Book - Great Stories, Photos and History","This was a most interesting book, especially with all the stories about Southern Appalachia. I have used many of the recipes, but I find the ""other"" information on the area and it's people the very best part of the book!"
4,Fabulous Food Folklore,"Dabney captures the culinary culture of the Appalachians. Wonderful anecdotes and reminiscing carry the reader along. The Michie Tavern Apple Cobbler recipe is excellent (Almost like dining there again!). There is a factual error relating to Kentucky Burgoo. Dabney writes that this was first introduced to Kentucky by Col. Jaubert in 1810. Jaubert wasn't born until about 1840 according to census records and his grave marker. This error was no fault of the writer, though. Marion Flexner's 'Out of Kentucky Kitchens', which was sourced, also includes this error."
4,Steeples: Poetry to top any seasons list,"I first read STEEPLES 25 years ago and it continues to be a favorite for me and the entire family, friends and acquaintences with whom I've shared these wonderful poems.Ogletree's poetic craftsmanship through rhyme and metered verse is a true joy that makes the reading aloud of his poems a shared pleasure. The themes and imagry stay in the mind and heart long after you've closed the slim volume.""Come To Christmas,"" the second section of STEEPLES, is inspirational, to say the least. ""The Legend of the Robin,"" has become, over the last two decades, a favorite; ""The First Christmas Bell"" still astounds; and ""The First Holly Wreath,"" and ""Legend of the Poinsettia"" remain spiritual inspirations!Along with STEEPLES, Ogletree's second volume, WEAVINGS, continues the tradition and both collections of verse make wonderful, lasting gifts to anyone including yourself."
4,Be prepared,"If you've read Mr. Roeder's books in order and have become close to his characters then you must prepare yourself for some shocking events in this one. I felt that the entire book was filled with one tragedy after another almost none stop. The total mood of the book was just as negative as it could be. There were times I simply had to just put the book away because it was just too sad to read on especially where Ethan is involved. I'm not trying to dissuade anyone from reading the book, far from it. It is well written and if you've read his previous books this one is a must read. Just be prepared for some unpleasant events that befall your favorite characters. Also, keep in mind that there is a reason it's called ""Altered Realities""."
2,Not Real Widescreen,"Sigh. The concert was shot in Widescreen, but they didn't make the DVD anamorphic!!! Meaning, it's letterboxed!Such a dissapointment! (If you watch this on a widescreen tv, you get black bars on top, bottom, left and right of your screen. Unless you Zoom in with your tv/player.This is ridiculous"
2,Could Have Been Way Better!,"Nelly Furtado had one of the greatest years of her career from early 2006 to late 2007. This concert came out recently, showcasing a number of hits from her Loose album and some older ones. I brought this concert because of the simple fact that I love the Loose album and wanted to see it come to life in front of my eyes. I was disappointed!!!! Nelly's performance was so boring, I almost had to force myself to keep watching. With songs like ""Wait for You"", ""Afraid"", ""Say It Right"", and ""Give it to Me"" being performed, I expected nothing short of an amazing concert. She absolutly murderered her own songs making me hate the live version of them. At times, even the crowd was silent and appeared stunned at what they were looking at. Stick to the CD and do not purchase this DVD, you'll regret it! I've brought some pretty crappy things in my life, but this is by far one of the top of that list."
2,Extremely Disappointing,"First off I love Nelly Furtado, she is an extremely talented musician and very beautiful. But this DVD was so disappointing. Let's start with how every song is completely different than the studio recordings now in some cases this is a good thing but here it's not. Nelly's performance is so-so but the thing that really ruined it was the band and her dancers. Also you can tell that the song's were doubled-over, meaning that the studio song is playing in the background and they are singing in harmony with them which is lame. So over all: Don't buy this DVD just watch a couple of clips on youtube and see for yourself."
2,not good,"Loose CD is great. This concert is most definately not. Others are correct that the aspect ratio is not anamorphic and is not good on a widescreen tv, especially with an upconverting dvd player. Stretches out the picture and makes her look short and fat.Performance is also very sub par. I don't know how you put out such a great CD and then butcher it in concert then release a dvd of it so everybody can see how bad you did it live.And what's with the poodle hairdoo? Blah"
2,"""as of first time viewing""","Not a big fan, just caught her music video at the gym and picked up the concert dvd as nelly is talented and catchy but I have to say this show is lethargic. i own over 150 dvd's and like to show them off but this one is not a rocker. check out pink's ""i'm not dead yet""."
4,"Content great, format too high-tech.","Although I thoroughly enjoy the music on Pavarotti & Friends For War Child, I could not play the CD as purchased on either of my CD players because it was in a 5.1 format. A friend copied it onto a disc I can play.I feel that CD's purchased through your company should be in formats able to be used be the masses, instead of a select few that are able to have state-of-the-art machinery.Other than that, I am extremely happy with your service (I was a first-time buyer), and with the CD as a whole. Thanks."
4,nocturne voices,"Love the album, double CD, only 2 tracks I dislike by the same artist otherwise very happy and arrived quickly"
3,Fatal flaw,"Well, I don't look down a lot while I'm typing, but, my, is that an ugly keyboard with all those characters all over the place. Other than that -- feels quite sturdy, but definitely much louder clicking than other recent keyboards. One fatal flaw, and the reason it's going back -- no equals sign on the numpad! Not sure how they can call it a Mac keyboard and leave that out. The reason it's so important to me is that I use Finale for music notation, and it requires easy access to the equals sign. Back it goes."
1,not so good,"Melvins are rock stars and have been since the early 90s , alas they dont really have it anymore . Jello is well , a spoken word artist these days . This record here falls short of anything great . It is very generic and there is really nothing special here . Just stick with your old DK records or some of the post industrial stuff he did . As for the MELVINS go no further than BULLHEAD ,OZMA,or GLUEY PORCH TREEATMENTS ."
5,"FABULOUS, GREAT.. Have to see it!","It is one of the greatest musical videos ever! The numerous performers finally do this great song justice. Eric Clapton (instrumetal), MerriAnne Faithful (singing in a smoky bar), a young boxer's father singing about Danny, his dead son... and many others are just out of this world. Impossible to find this video so far... but if you find it, get it!"
4,"Out of Print, but a keeper if you can find it","I own this on VHS tape. I purchased it from PBS over 10 years ago. It probably cost thirty bucks then! LOL Looks like this is still the only way to see it (no DVD release yet). I posted a photo here on amazon, and if it helps, the PBS item # is DBSS-901.Danny Boy provides a historical context for the song and its importance in music as well as significance for Ireland. Many musicians, both popular and unknown, put their own mark on Danny Boy.A nice video, although I found the repeated cuts to the pretty girl playing a harp in the field a bit much. Conversely, Shane MacGowan can sing but boy is he tough to look at!40 minutes."
1,Was NOT FOR ME.,"This product came highly recommended for my chronic joint pain. I began taking the product and by day two I had a severe headache. Since I am prone to headaches, I continued to take the product for another four days. The headache never subsided for the entire five days, so I discontinued the product. Within 24-hours, the headache was completely gone. However, I do know this product has 'worked miracles' for others. It just was NOT for me. I suggest you try this product but discontinue it immediately if you get an uncontrollable headache. Amazon did allow me to return the product for a full refund. As always, Amazon is THE GREATEST! Thank you."
3,not enough paintings,"This large, well-produced book features far more reproductions of photographs by Eakins and his circle than reproductions of his paintings. All reproductions of images are excellent, but, again, far too few paintings are included. There is some interesting scholarship concerning Eakins' use of photography. The book is arranged chronologically, with images scattered throughout; this scattering reduces the accessibility of the relatively few reproductions of the paintings. This book provides some fresh, interesting scholarship on a significant American artist, but it may be a disappointment for those who want primarily to look at Eakins' paintings."
3,Not Suede and Not Bad,"This debut from the reconstituted Bernard Butler and Brett Anderson has a lot of expectations to overcome before even listening to it. Is it as good as old Suede? Are the boys getting on? Will they reinvent rock? Well, after nearly five or so listens, Here Come the Tears strikes me as a solid debut; not in the same class as Suede's debut -- it's not as fresh as that -- but an honorable start over. The song structures hue closer in spirit to late Suede than anything. Anderson's voice is fraying at the edges but full of character. And their lyrical pursuits haven't changed much. Outcasts on society's edges haunt every song, and the old tropes are tired. But when they stray from the tried and true, there are standouts: ""Two Creatures"", ""Lovers"", and ""Co-Stars"" especially. Even better: the b-sides on the recent single for ""Refugees"". Welcome back, boys."
5,Beauty long lost,"I'm not going to repeat what other reviewers have written so succinctly. In short, this album exudes heartwrenching beauty that has long been lost in popular music- pain, love, lust, animosity all put to the fore in the intricate sonic picture that was B&B's. Afterall, Bernard and Brett each found what they've been missing as far as music is concerned. I hope they're gonna do it again, again and again."
3,sturdy but not high enough,"I like the look of this stool, the width, the size that it takes up is good but it just isn't tall enough for a toddler. That is a big deal for a stool, thus only 3 stars. My son is 3 and he is finally able to use it to wash his hands from the sink but still has to stand on his tippy toes to turn the water on and he is not a shorty! It is however an okay height for helping toddlers on and off the potty. We have had the stool since the very beginning of potty training and it has held up well and is easy to clean. It just isn't high enough!"
3,Good for the price. Inexpensive so we essentially got what we paid for.,"Not bad but not great. A bit flimsy but good for the price. My son uses it whenever he uses the guest bathroom and it works fine. For $9, I can't complain too much."
2,Not my cup of Tea,"Good sound and recording quality but Svetlanov has done these works more idiomatically in the past.All 3 symphony recordings from this time - not just the Rach 2nd - feature unusual tempos and exaggerations and are not recommended. Not everyone will agree and there ARE good reviews of these recordings (on MusicWeb International) so to each their own, I guess.Perhaps this conducting style would better suit the Scriabin symphonies but I haven't heard Svetlanov's recordings of those yet (from this same Warner anthology recorded during the 1990's) but OK I'm talking Scriabin and this is supposedly a review of the Rachmaninov.But before I sign off, one more thing slightly off-topic regarding unusual tempos, its not that I don't like them, take for example an iconic example where this works - check out Willem Mengelberg conducting Mahler Symphony 4..."
5,LOVE this watch !,I absolutely love this watch ! It is a perfect size. I was previously looking at the Bulova Chronograph similar to this but when I saw it in the store... it was alittle too fancy. This fits my needs for everything. It's dressy enough to wear with nice clothes and casual enough to wear with jeans. I LOVE IT !
5,Communication Catalyst,This is an excellent book that gives a way for individuals to take difficult problems/situations involving people and use communication to resolve the problem. It is well written with good illustrations.
2,Not Exactly an Encyclopedia,"The book was OK, some good ideas, some very elaborate ones. I think the scale was too extreme. It's not an encyclopedia by any means, wrong word to have in the title. Good book to flip through in the bookstore, not sure you need to own it."
4,Worth the money,"This product saved me from having to either replace my motherboard or get a whole new computer. Well worth the $20. Worked fine right from install, no fuss no muss."
4,Great read,"I am currently reading through this with a friend who was actually a student of the author's. So far we both are really enjoying the book, and find what the author has to say to be very interesting. I have to admit that it's opened my eyes quite a bit, and I always enjoy a book that can do that."
5,Excellent,Excellent biography of a man who was not recognized for his lifelong acomplishments. Little did I know what he acomplished until I read this book. He also never forgot the people along his lifes journey. A good read for everyone.
4,Chrysler,"Enjoyed the book, as former CEO, Chairman of Mack Trucks and a close personal friend of Lee Iaccoca. Also would like to know from the auther his family background. Had a Uncle, a half brother of my dad, named Vicent Curcio. Want to know if he is any relation??Jack Curcio doept@islc.net"
3,Very Well Done,"I've been a Smokie fan ever since I have heard them first back in 1977. This album is miles away from their great releases from the seventies and early eighties. Gone are the times where Smokie ripped through songs like 'Pass it Around' or 'Going Tomorrow'. But overall it is a very nice surprise. Even there is only one member of the original group left, every song still sounds like Smokie. That includes the beautiful background vocals. Of course Mike Craft has added his personal touch to the band but I consider this a plus - he does not try to imitate Chris Norman. Overall, I like this album better than the first 'Uncovered'. Smokie do an excellent job on songs like 'Only you', 'Lodi' or 'Everytime you go away'. It's a nice 'easy listening' album and I am definitely looking forward to the next release with hopefully new original songs."
4,Clearing the smoke!,"After what has seemed an age, Smokie have shown that age does not diminish quality of the product!Even with a new lead singer (Mike Craft)- for both this and ""Uncovered""- the distinctive Smokie sound remains!I particularly enjoyed""Every Time You Go Away"",""Only You"", and the cover of the Jeff Lynne/Tom Petty song..""I Won't back Down""There is a certain intensity attached to the track ""No Matter What""...but the best track of all..in my humble opinion..is""(I Just) Died In Your Arms Tonight""Mike Craft has come up trumps with ""The Voice"" of Smokie.Well done.And there is no stinting on quality on this CD either.Average track length is 4 mins, with track 5 approaching a full 5 minutes!Buy it...Now!"
5,A Nonverbal Must-read,"Without question, this is the seminal research on how people receive your nonverbal signals. Yes, it does drift into academic language (the author, after all, is a renowned professor of psychology at UCLA). Still, its practical implications are many for business executives, speakers, salespeople -- anyone who wants to gain a better understanding of human interactions."
5,very good scientific study,This is a top quality scientific study of non-verbal communications. The author is well-renowned for his expertise in the area. He sets forth his knowledge with all due precision and professionalism.
5,My 5 year old son loves this game and so do we.,"This is my son's favorite board game, he plays it over and over! It's simple and fun and doesn't require reading skills. My husband and I both enjoy playing it with him. I would say it's probably my favorite game of his also. Each game takes about 10 minutes, but the more players you have, the longer it will take.I was surprised to see the other reviews that commented on the difficulty of connecting the pieces together. My son goes to occupational therapy for fine motor skill development delays and he fits the pieces together easily."
4,Nutrafin Pro Feed Fish Feeder,"I'm glad to have this product, which was highly recommended to me by the man who services my 200gal home tank. It installed easily, 'though I will need to have my cover cut (an extra expense because I can't do it) so that I don't lose so much water to evaporation (by keeping lid off to accomodate the feeder). Seems to work as intended, but it is a little awkward to remove (for loading or battery changes), and more awkward to fill. Yet, it's a life saver! (For fish and me!)"
1,Drags badly...,"While the Vlad books aren't great literature by a long shot, they are usually lively and complex. However, here Brust decides to get psychological and does it very badly. Either Vlad or Brust needs a major course of anti-depressants and perhaps an intro to abnormal psych. *sigh* Just goes to prove Brust is just another sword&dagger fantasist. The other books are still good reading, though, except for Orca."
2,"The weakest of the Vlad novels, but still worth reading...","I wasn't very fond of the switch to the third person point of view. You never get to ""see"" Vlad's thought process which is one of the greatest things about the other books in the series. And you never hear Loiosh say one word! However, it is a Vlad book and if you enjoyed the others you should still read this one to keep you up on ""current events."" I had to give this book two stars instead of one because, it IS a Vlad novel and because, if nothing else, it makes a really great (if long) prologue to Orca!"
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Vlad has been living the wandering life for a couple of years, not being an assassin and just generally trying to keep himself together.He meets a young apprentice, and decides to teach him a few things, for his own reasons. However, his past Jhereg life catches up with him, and he and the boy Savn are put to the test to get out of it alive."
4,Vlad runs into a little unfinished business,"A lot of people don't like this installment in the series because it is such a departure from the others. It is written in third-person style and it features the new, conscience-wracked, green- and brown-clad Vlad trying to run from his past through the bucolic countryside of Smallcliff. While completely out of keeping with its fellows, it is all the stronger for it. Stylistically it is the strongest and most cohesive of the books, with a totally new flavor to the language lent by the change of perspective. It also provides a needed glimpse into the daily life of the Teckla, whom we had only seen as filthy ignoramuses or fiery revolutionaries until now. It does not, however, receive the same exemplary ratings as some of its bedfellows due to its plot, which, while tremendously entertaining, is in fact Brust going back to a meal he'd already finished. Still, I'm tremendously fond of it, and like it better with each subsequent rereading."
4,A continuation of the Taltos series..but a little different,"In Athyra, Brust continues the adventures of Vlad Taltos,sorcerer and (ex-)assassin. This book is written in a differentstyle that the others(jhereg,yendi,teckla,taltos,and pheonix),and Vlad is no longer the principal narrator.As a result,this book is not quite as enjoyable as the others, but it isstill a definate read if you read the others."
5,Another excellent novel from Brust!,"If you haven't read Phoenix and Teckla, you probably won't get much out of this book. If you have read Phoenix and Teckla, then I'm sure you'll love Athyra! Athyra is a stark contrast to Brust's earlier novels. Instead of being a story of epic proportions, Athyra is instead the story of Vlad's visit to a small farming village. Instead of changing the outcome of the succession of the Imperial Orb, Vlad manages to make a change for for the town. The change of pace is great, and I recommend Athyra to any avid Taltos fan!"
1,Awful.,"568 pages of elementary material that could have been covered in less than 100. The author shamelessly pads every chapter and every topic to add bulk, but not information, to the book. For instance, the chapter on searching is 34 pages for a topic that could have been extensively handled in 10. A waste of money in my opinion - and definitely not a good advertisement for any MIS Press title. Jerry"
1,Packaging,"Packaging on this item was poor and it arrived with a broken case. CD was okay, but I'd like a replacement on the CD case."
5,Amor (Spanish Version) Andrea Bocelli,"Beautiful, Gorgeous, the best CD I had heard in years. Bravo! Andrea Bocelli!"
4,"Best so far, almost perfect.","I cannot say enough about the beam color (white, not blue which is so common), intensity and the switch logic (most likely micro processor controlled) on the Palm Blaze 3C. I wish it felt more like the Streamlight, but they got the most important part right.I previously bought a Streamlight 51002 TT-3C 3 C-Cell Xenon/6-LED Twin-Task Flashlight and was immediately impressed by the construction and how it felt in hand. The honeymoon was over quickly as I pushed the switch (too stiff), experienced the beam (not bright by today's standards, three modes: blue, more blue and yellowish), and the need to cycle through all three modes any time the flashlight is used.On the Palm Blaze 3C you push the switch once for high, again quickly for low, or press and hold until it enters flash mode. Once you are in any mode for a few seconds, press once for off. Simple. The switch itself could be more pronounced #as on the Streamlight), but tactily, it's just right.A great value overall."
5,"Bright, solid build, bright, good weight, bright, nice design, and bright","In concurrence with previous reviews, it has two brightness levels: bright as hell, and over 9000. It's an extremely bright flashlight, it feels good in your hand, and you don't need to sell a small country to pay for the batteries. The lens projects a concentrated square of light but also disperses the classic circle of light around the square, just less concentrated. Push the button once for ""over 9000"" mode, again within 3 seconds for ""bright as hell"" mode, and hold for 3 seconds for the strobe mode. Excellent flashlight, if this is the first flashlight you've looked at while shopping for flashlights, stop shopping and buy it, you wont find a better one for your money."
3,Limited DVD,"This DVD is a great addition to any fan's collection, but it is very limited. For a series that ran for 26 episodes you would expect to get more than just three episodes on this disk. Especially considering that most incomplete DVD releases for animated series contain at least 5 episodes. One good alternative to this DVD is that the Amazon Unbox offers the entire series for download.The three episodes in this release are the first three produced for the series: The Tears of Sadness, The Meek and the Mighty, and The Purple Buffalo."
4,"Mavis Staples, outstanding.","I bought this CD for the Mavis Staples 'Hard Times' recording, however on hearing the rest of the recordings I was quite impressed. If you are interested in this type of music you can not go wrong with this CD."
4,Pretty good,"Mostly well done and creative interpretations of Stephen Foster classics with a few more obscure gems included. Great quality recordings, as I would expect, and fine performances from well known artists like John Prine and Yo Yo Ma. Some bowdlerization of Foster's lyrics, now deemed racist, are to be expected, and in some cases, it gives the songs a more universal appeal. Foster's ability to capture universal emotions in his lyrics are part of what made him so popular anyway. One unfortunate omission is ""Old Black Joe"", a beautiful song that just wouldn't make any sense if it were de-racialized. My one big musical beef is that the title song, one of the most gorgeous and amazing melodies ever written in 9/8 time, has been dumbed down to 3/4. Otherwise, I really like this collection, and it's various artists help show how relevant and wonderful these Stephen Foster songs remain."
4,Stellar effort,"Tribute CDs come and go, but very few are anything special and have much lasting power. For the most part, you hear one and think, ""Hmmm... it's nothing compared to the 'original'."" I have been disappointed by tribute albums more than I have been thrilled by them. The same goes for covers of historical songs by modern artists. But like ""Oh, Brother, Where Art Thou"" and ""Tulare Dust"", this tribute brings to life the energy and richness of songs you might have thought of as tired or outdated. I had never heard of this CD when I bought it in September -- I was just looking for a fourth CD to get free at Borders, and found it on a special display. So this gem came as a complete surprise. I haven't listened to one CD so often in a long, long time. Absolutely delightful. My only qualm is that I wish at least one more cover on this CD had been done as upbeat and fun. The ballads are scrumptious, but need the balance of at least one more bouncy song."
4,Beautiful Dreamer CD,I needed for a video montage and had seen play as a little girl. Great and personalized service. The songs are actually quite catchy.
5,Outstanding no BS guide to starting a business,"This book is a true gem. So many books on starting a business of your own are filled with fluff and pie in the sky pseudo-motivational junk. Not this one. It describes a business virtually anyone in reasonably good health can start for very little capital. The work is hard, but the pay is good, and you learn everything you need to know to start working for yourself. Outstanding and highly recommended."
5,Good,"This book is a very good resource for making money using a truck. Even if you already have a job, reading this book will provide valuable information on making extra money."
1,Save your money,The writer of this book has an amazing grasp of the obvious. There is nothing in this book that anyone wouldn't think of on their own.
3,"Nice, but very WEAK!!!","Quality cologne is a scent that lasts all day long. They will even adjust throughout the day. THIS cologne smells nice when you first spray it, but within a couple of hours, there is no trace left. Take Dolce Gabana for men.. this cologne is not only noticeable for hours, but after a night out, your shirt will smell like the cologne (and that is a good thing). With Chanel on the other hand, you can't even detect any traces on your own shirt.For over $125, why would anyone buy this, when you can buy a much stronger and nicer cologne like Dolce for half the price?!"
4,Good,"Ok for dental lab purposes, the pressure gauge came with 20plus psi reading when it should have been set to 0 psi. Nevertheless it is fully functional"
3,They run big,"I bought these for my daughter who is a toddler size 8. I bought the right size according to the size chart, but when I got them they were almost a size too big on her foot."
1,Blister-inducer,The water shoes wore blisters on my daughter's heels after the first wear. No thanks!
3,Must have for toddler feet,"These shoes are great for the pool. Kept by 3 year old from slipping, stayed on tightly.They were good for the beach - especially a rocky one. Only problem, tough to remove the sand."
1,Gave my daughter sores on her feet.,"She has worn water shoes multiple times in the past, these rubbed her poor little feet raw in one day."
3,It's alright.,"The shoe seems to hold up alright so far. The elastic is hard to keep in place. However, my son is super sensitive about shoes and the inside step really bothers him. The plastic rubs his instep. If you have a sensitive child, it may be hard to keep him or her in them."
3,"Sole lining unglues easily, otherwise good.","Bought this in blue for a three-year-old. They are comfortable, easy enough to get on and off and grippy enough. They do get logged with sand at the beach and are a bit hard to clean out, but that's not a showstopper. I find the lining on the inside sole of the shoe comes unglued pretty easily though (just a handful of wears), and although the padding/sole underneath is thick, sand sticks to it even more than to the other surfaces of the shoe, making it uncomfortable to wear without the lining. I have had the same experience with the Babies R Us water shoes (which are less expensive, and otherwise just as adequate). Still looking for a closed-toe kids' water shoe that will protect against rocks at the beach but won't fall apart on me!"
2,Dislike!,"After reading the reviews, I bought my 2 yr old a size 5. Didnt want to get them too big. They are difficult to get on, and I had to cut the elastic. the sole is right, its the mesh around it that is too tight. I like the cheaper Kmart style water shoes MUCH better. and they are half the price!!! dislike!"
2,The sizing chart is wrong,"The sizing chart indicated that a size 5 Toddler is 4.75 inches long. However, when I ordered these, the 5T size was longer than 6 inches. I had to return the shoe, because it was too big for my toddler.Do not trust the sizing chart on the shoe. The shoe itself looks nice, but unfortunately, I didnt get to try it out on my child."
1,Right Shoe is not properly stitched right.,I bought two different pairs to see if the first one was defective but its the way the shoe is made. The right shoe will give your child blisters because the inside stitching indents into the left side of the right foot causing the skin to rub against it and causing blisters. Weird how the left side is perfectly fine and doesnt touch the skin!! Do not buy!!!!!
1,Blisters on my baby's feet!,"These shoes are cute and seemed to fit well, but the seam and tag in the insole left blisters on both of my two-year-old's feet! I've returned them and am ordering some from a different brand."
3,Wore out quickly,We really like these shoes but I have to order another pair since my child has already worn a hole through one of the shoes (after only 1 month). Better the shoe take a beating than his foot though. Found them to be easy to get on and off and my son doesn't mind wearing them. Agree that they run a bit big.
5,the perfection,"this is one of the best album I ever listen to. Her voice takes you on a wonderful journey. Best tracks ""Love never dies""; ""Go talk to Mary""; ""Te amo"".Hope to see her perform very soon."
5,Cute lil accessory,"Adorable little litter bag...LOOKS GREAT. Velvet like material on front looks black, but in sunlight is a glittery dark blue. Very cool!"
3,"Cute, But Small","IT's smaller than I imagined -- gotta read the details closely! But the design is good & keeps some trash off the floor That's the whole idea, right?"
2,Too many cuts!,"This is a great TV novela, I watched in Mexico a few years ago. The story is great, and I remember it had a lot of success. However, the edit is not well done. I'm very dissapointed because the story has too many cuts, it's difficult to follow up!"
4,Not like the Mystic Moods of the 70's,"If you are looking for a re-released version of the Mystic Moods of the 70's, look elsewhere. If you aren't familiar with the original orchestra...This DTS CD has merit. The sounds of nature combined with the beautiful melodies allow the listener to relax and become transported to the world of your imagination. While disappointed in the beginning I am quickly becoming a fan."
2,"for me, disappointing","let me preface this by saying that Philip K. Dick is one of my favorite writers. this is the 14th of his books that i've read and it is so far my least favorite. i don't want to spoil anything for anyone who reads the book so i'll merely say that it starts off interestingly enough, but for me it degenerates into what feels like a plodding episode of night gallery. and then it ends with an anti-communist storyline that seems silly to me, speaking from 2005. i've also read most of his non-scifi from this period and would say that i like his 60's work best. happy reading to you."
4,a very original piece of early science fiction,"'Eye in the Sky', written years before Philip K. Dick's golden era (late 1960s/early 1970s), is a forgotten jewel. And it is one of the few novels by the author that might appeal to folks who don't care for science fiction since the story doesn't involve space travel, time travel or aliens.The clever story involves an accident at a scientific lab where several unconscious folks are absorbed into the minds of another victim who is conscious. So in effect they live in the world of how another person sees it - distorted, bizarre, and often dangerous. Yes, it all sounds a bit daft. And in the beginning I wasn't sure if this story line would hold. But actually the story gets more and more engaging. I think 'Eye in the Sky' should be viewed as one of Philip K. Dick's best works, along with 'Ubik' and 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"".Bottom line: a must read for Philip K. Dick fans (present and future). Recommended."
5,Touches the timeless question of what is reality,"A group of persons are visiting a strange machine (what is it good for nobody knows or cares) when suddenly that thing goes berserk and kaboooom it explodes leaving some of the tourist unconscious, but with enough mental activity, that in turns allows, the most alert of them to be capable of forcing the others into the former's view of reality. A fantastic science fiction novel in which the story line never takes an obvious turn and will keep you amused until the last page."
5,Beautiful Cello Music,"Different than what other people say, this is an extremely beautiful Cello CD; check it out for yourself."
3,Smooth Sound,This CD is very smooth and relaxing as the title suggests. A little disapointing as The 12 Cellos of The Berlin Philharmonic are only on a couple of tracks and thats what you buy this CD to hear their fabulous sound. Its all too brief.
2,cello mudiv,I was disappointed in the music. It was not beautiful or relaxing. it was boring and depressing. not the seller's fault unless they were the musician..
4,I like it very much!,"This book was hard to put down. The pictures are adorable (especially of Clint Conley!) and the interviews kept me reading ahead. It made me want to start doing aerobic exercises again, having shunned them for years due to the creepy workout culture. Big credits to Hilken and Maura for spreading the word that you don't have to spend a pile of money to be fit or buy into a bulls**t philosophy about punk or a choke down a corporate spin on health. I am also relieved to know that there is a class I can take that plays the music I like where I won't feel like a Bally's reject. I will recommend this book to all my friends."
5,Fun moves + DIY attitude,"For the aerobic phobic: I checked out the classes and had a lot of fun, so bought the book for a kick - and ended up doing it at home, putting old punk compilations to perfect use! These girls have stayed true to their roots but the results are clear - and their advice works. Bonus are the exercise testimonials from people like Mike Watt and Robyn Hitchcock... great photos... and excellent lists of books and music for people who want to dive into punk history. No other book like it! Looking forward to a DVD..."
2,A Ho-Hum Groundbreaker,"Credited with being one of the earliest and most influential examples of noir gone British, this first of the ""Factory Series"" didn't work for me. The nameless policeman who works in the ""Department of Unexplained Deaths"" is a loner who lives for his work in the classic sense of the fictional detective. His investigation into the brutal murder of a apparently poor man is given depth and resonance when he finds the dead man's rambling audio journals. The tapes slowly reveal a series of clues and serve to help the detective identify with and empathize with the victim. It's not particularly convincing, nor is his method of getting close to the murderer, and the ending is totally weird and over-the-top. This did not encourage me to sample further books in the series."
2,I made myself finish this book,"I made myself finish this book wondering where the author was going. Trying to put a ""style"" to his writing - it was like watching a movie from the 1940's. If you like those movies you will like this book."
4,James M. Cain...on octane,"I can't believe I never knew about this writer until recently...havingaccidentally discovered him on the Net.The only warning here is: once you start reading, you can't stop.Also, I gave his I WAS DORA SUAREZ five stars. The book is so strongit just might make a few people vomit.Would love to get The Hidden Files, only it seems tough to locate here in theU.S.Lastly, you might be bummed out to know Raymond died back in l994. Atleast we have the books.Powerful stuff indeed."
2,Largely a disappointment,"GHOSTS OF BERLIN is certainly not what I had hoped it would be. It features poor quality paper, rather poorly reproduced photos (one gets the sense it was created on a good personal printer), and captions that, for the most part, are fairly uninformative: I knew what I was looking at, but I am pretty familiar with Berlin's recent history. If you are not, you won't have your world enlightened by the captions. Taken as a whole or in parts, I would never have bought this book if I had know how inadequate it would prove to be. Save your money, seriously."
5,Terrific,I am using the dual language books to refresh my German and they are a tremendous help. This particular volume is lovely and came in great condition. I would like to see some dual language Schiller and Heym but for now am happy there is some selection at Amazon.
2,Not The Tracy Brown I Know,"I have read all of Tracy's books up to date and I was not impressed with the story of Lamin, Lucky,Dream, Olivia,Zion and Curtis. This was not a pageturner it took me a week to read it. I kept thinking it would get better but to me it never did. I don't know what book the other reviewrs were reading but the Tracy Brown that I am used to keeps my emotions on high and my boold pumping. It's all good though I won't give up on this author because I simply loved Black and I truly enjoyed Dimepiece."
3,why do people give this book five stars?,Let me start off by saying it was an ok book. First and For most I wasn't really that big a fan of black but i listened to allt hese crazy reviews and bought it. I was in Borders and i just couldn't find the book that i was looking for. So i went through tons of book and stumbled across this one. I was like Hey maybe this would be better than black. Well it was an ok read. I probably wouldn't have even tried to finish it and I probably wouldn't even give it three stars if it wasn't for Olivia. Olivia was to real and so cool reminded me of myself. I wasn't feeling Lucky at all maybe because she was of Asian decent but whatever it was I was not into her at all. If you ain't got nothin else to read then I would suggest you buy it but if not trust ti aint worth your time nor money.
4,Another great one for Tracy!!!,I am a huge tracy Brown fan and loved all of her books so far and this one was great as well. The characters were well developed and the story line was great! This is another must read!
4,A good read,"First off let me say that I have read two of tracey browns novels so far and I am hooked on her books. I loved how the story was narrated so that we could explore all of the characters thoughts and emotions. I loved how real lamin and lucky relationship was, but I was said that it did not end well. This book is a must read."
1,"Boring and STUPID ""Don't be afraid of the Dark"" is AWFUL!","Moral of the story is this: The NAME ""Guillermo Del Toro"" does NOT guarantee a good movie. I seen his name and I wasted $10 at Wal-Mart for this piece of garbage. It wasn't even frightening-but stupid and idiotic. Oddball creatures that looked like ""Critters"" with legs wants to eat little girl's teeth. I'm still shaking my head how terrible this movie was, and I will NEVER AGAIN trust the name ""Guillermo Del Toro"" again. I hated the movie so much I THREW IT IN THE TRASH. SAVE YOUR MONEY-DON'T BUY THIS ONE. IT'S SERIOUSLY *AWFUL*, STUPID, BORING--A VERY BAD MOVIE!"
1,Horrible.,"This movie was probably the worst of its genre I have ever seen. It wasn't scary. The actions of the characters were nonsensical. And the the continuity was beyond horrendous. I could go into more detail, but I'm so pissed off for watching it that I don't wish to honor it with anymore of my time."
5,don't be afraid of the dark,"This movie was absolute awlsome. It's very scary in some part's of it through out the movie, I would tell everyone I know to buy this movie. I wanted to go see it at the movies at the time it came out but didn't have the money to go see it. I bought this movie from Amazon.Marlene"
4,"5 stars for Atmosphere, acting so-so, great story.","Love Del Torro, and his hand is obvious in this film. Katie Holmes is her usual blah self, but the atmosphere and story are examples a great horror-fantasy story."
1,Rats on steroids that wanna kill!,"Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark!? It really should've been titled ""Good actors Who Were Bored."" This movie is HORRIBLE! Katie Holmes and Guy Pearce must of been bored or needed a rent check. I'm a huge fan of horror movies, but this one definitely belongs somewhere else. Don't waste your money on this movie. It could've had so much potential to be a really good horror movie, but like many movies go, it ends up going in a different direction then you thought and gets really long, boring, and predictable."
3,Entertaining!,"I thought it was pretty good! Kinda reminded me of ""Gremlins"", but a much meaner and darker movie. Besides the ""Why are they still in the house???!"" question, there were quite a few things in the plot that don't make sense and never get explained. Rated ""R"", but should be ok for most teens. I give it 3 1/2 out of 5."
1,more funny than anything else,"there are no words to describe how pathetic an attempt for a scary movie this was. i seriously knew it was a dud 5 minutes into it, yet my mom, who was watching it with me, wanted us to give it a try. less than halfway through, we were both making our own commentary, laughing out loud, and fast forwarding (this thing is soooo freaking slow, adding to the absurdity of the story) to the end just to see what happens. compared to katie holmes' other movies (this one isn't even comparable to any of her others), it makes one think if she was really hard up for a role when she did this. avoid like the plague, or rent for a good laugh."
2,Wow-What a waste of my time and money,"I have to say, I had high hopes for this one. I am a Horror/Thriller movie junkie, and this one just really didn't do anything for me. I thought it was all very predictable, and the ending was a joke! Sorry, I have to say if that was me, I would've been out long before, but of course that's not how it works in Hollywood and that's why this bomb of a movie was made. Ugh. Glad I rented and didn't buy."
1,Dreadful!,The idea of this movie would have been okay if it had been done as the cover implies it would be. Instead if creepy shadowy figures we get poorly done CG monsters so early in the movie that they are more boring than anything by the end.
2,"Rent it cheap, don't buy it","If you like Gremlins, or Critters, or Ghoulies, then you might like the little creatures in this movie. Not good overall though. HORRIBLE ending. I gave it 2 stars because the creatures are kinda funny. Don't buy this movie, rent it for no more than $1 and you won't feel too bad. I don't like giving negative reviews, but I was seriously angry when it ended. I've read reviews where people are really trying hard to fill the plot holes, but no, I think the editors closed their eyes and removed sections of the film. Especially the ending."
2,The Trailer Was Scarier,"I was actually looking forward to this film when I first saw the trailer. The trailer, IMO, was VERY scary. The film is not. The only reason I didn't give this 1 star was b/c of the young actress. She's very good in the film and essentially carries it. The story is ridiculous, the visual effects are over the top and the acting done by Katie Holmes is just bad. She's out acted by a nine year old."
3,It was actually OK!,A good movie and at a good price. Definately worth it!! And I am a very picky renter too. so go ahead and sit back and relax your in for a bit of a scare!!!!!!!!
3,ok if you can fully suspend disbelief,how many times do these knuckleheads have to be given chances to get away before they leave....and then not to take them out after you know where they live cmon...
1,"Huge disappointment, TERRIBLE acting, poorly written script",I will start off by saying that the cinematography is wonderful and the child actress was a pleasant surprise. I was also impressed by the computer generated creatures.Negatives:Guy Pearce and Katie Holmes are beyond terrible at their craft. I cannot believe that someone actually paid them to do this movie.The script is full of holes and whoever edited the movie should be ashamed. Perhaps the biggest inconsistencies are the frequent scenes at night when the camera cuts to a window and it appears to be broad daylight outside.
3,Katie Holmes cant act,"I was let down by this film, the atmosphere and whimsical music seemed contrived, and Katie Holmes's acting is on par with a high school or junior high drama student..Every time I would get into the movie I would get distracted by her cue card acting style.I would of rated this movie higher if she was not so distracting."
2,"Less Monsters, More House.","I thought this was going to be a great haunted/monster house movie. I was sold that Del Toro produced it as I am a big fan of his work, but for some reason this film did not deliver. It felt too much like an Adult ""Are You Afraid of the Dark"" episode. I also didn't like that the monsters were so in your face through most of the third act. One's mind makes a movie scary, but seeing the terror over kills it and take away from the audiences own fears. Not to mention to CG looked really bad. Katie Holmes was terrible and the kid was unlikeable, so two out of the three main characters suck......Anyways, all this movie did was make me want to see the original because I hear that is a lot better. There was a lot of missed potential I felt. But hey, you win some you loose some right?"
1,Gremlins 3 gone wrong!,"OK, I'm a fan of Del Toro and he produced this garbage so that made me interested enough to watch it.Yes to a pretty cool Gothic feel to it, although the mansion interior is a total copy of ""drag me to hell"" (which was a MUCH better movie anyway).Every time I watch ""Pieces of April"" I just can't believe how GREAT Katie Holmes was in it, but here she is a complete mess..she has absolutely NO idea of what she's doing...btw, what else has she done even close to that first movie???Guy Pierce is another talent who's a total waste here...btw, what else has he done even close to ""Memento""???The girl Bailee is just OK...actually annoying so I couldn't wait for the creatures to get rid of her.This is an attempt to do a Gremlins part 3, but that has gone totally wrong!NO humor at all, and absolutely FULL of plot holes.I couldn't believe about how bad it was 99% of the time (and I REALLY wanted to like it! I mean it!)DO NOT waste your time."
3,don't know about this,Never saw this one. I have no strong opinion about it. I see Katie Holmes is in it. Not good.
3,Okay,"I was interested in this movie as I like the horror genre and the cast seemed decent. The movie was fun, it was entertaining but I wasn't surprised or impressed with anything. It was a usual story, with usual acting, and a somewhat disappointing ending."
2,"Pretty to look at, fairly awful otherwise - especially if you like the original!","The look of the film is top-notch; breathtaking sets, gloomy atmosphere, beautiful cinematography - everything you'd expect with Guillermo del Toro co-producing. Too bad the movie's a mess, not very scary, and full of illogical character reactions or actions that will have you yelling ""What the HELL are you doing? Just turn on the freaking LIGHTS!"" more than once. The original TV-movie remains the best, so creepy it will have you looking over your shoulder after a viewing; this one, not even close."
2,Region code 2 does not work in US DVD players,"This movie is in Region code 2 and does not work in US DVD players, did not know this when i purchased the movie. Region number was not given on web site. will try to return it..."
2,I've seen scarier,"I liked the movie and all, but I've seen scarier. Like Bag Of Bones, that was scary. Tense and freaky, Not scary."
3,"Not Bad, But Not Great","My wife sat down and watched this movie together, and we were both in agreement that it had some fair production value and acting, and the concept wasn't bad. However, as my wife and I both also agreed, it wasn't really all that scary to us, and we both decided that it was perhaps maybe worth a watch but not much more. Rent this one first."
3,guy pearce !,"this movie was well made,cgi etc, good performance by child actress, guy pearce is great actor...spoiler alert!.........................................................................................................................................katie holmes get eatin!"
3,Common sense can be the greatest weapon!,"The most irritating thing about scary movies is when, seemingly intelligent, people make the most ridiculous choices, especially when the obvious decisions are staring them in the face. If you know there are little monkey/rat/demon fairies that like to eat children and are afraid of light, roaming freely through your home, then you don't give your child a sedative, leave her in a dark room, BY HERSELF, and not expect the little critters to come a sniffin. You put her somewhere that is not easily locked, filled with lights that are not easily extinguished, strap several flashlights to the kid with FRESH batteries, and give her a mallet, so she can squash the little beasties, at will. OR better yet! Take her out of the house and never return, again. It was suspenseful. I will grant it that. Aaaaaand all of the actors did very well, but come ON!! Grow some common sense for crying out loud!"
1,Awful. Or is it a spoof?,"Wow. That was the worst ""horror"" flick I've ever seen, at least among those which are not spoofs. The acting was awful, and actually made me laugh out loud a couple times. Now I know why I've never seen Katie Holmes in a movie before. By the end, I really did question whether this was supposed to be along the lines of Scary Movie. I believe I read somewhere that this was a remake of a made-for-tv movie. That should have been warning enough. And the writing?? Look, I'm no movie critic and don't pretend to have a better sense of acting or storylines than the next person. But, just by way of example (without giving anything away-which wouldn't matter anyway because it's all totally predictable), something tragic happens in the house, the police show up, and then everyone goes about their business like nothing happened. You've been warned, watch if you dare! And that last sentence is scarier than anything you'll see in this tv knockoff."
1,horribly horrible,this movie was just plain stupid. totally predictable with unbelievably poor acting. don't waste your money on it. it wouldn't even work as a parody of the genre.
1,Placing the Blame,"In reading this book, I would have to say that the issues brought forth by the author poses an issue of placing the blame. While the subject of possessing spiritual faith was highly valid, the author however, in his argument about our current black leaders scaming the american black public is just holding forth a revolving cycle of pointing the finger. In my opinion, I think this book will make for a great debate on the views and beliefs of all Americans, not just African Americans."
1,Right Wing Propaganda and Hate,"Manufactured ""facts"" abound and are used to prop up the usual sneering, thinly-veiled racist arguments. This is what the right has come to in America: dirty tricks, lies and hate. So called ""black"" sources are the usual rich Republicans who are completely out of touch with the black community. If you believe this guy I've got a bridge to sell you."
1,"Very narrow,not well thought out","It reads as far right as Michael Moore is left. The point about reparations having already been paid. Through civil war deaths is absurd at best. That is akin to robbing a bank, and that a shootout with the police is repayment.He also states that those to whom repayment would be given cannot be found.The fact is that, Black people, any opressed people must help themselves for their own sake. This does not however relieve the opressor of any human obligation. Both need to happen.Also, it's not just slavery that African Americans have suffered, but Jim Crow laws as well. These laws kept them from receiving the fruits of their ancestors labor. This continued in many places till after 1970. These victims of legislated deprivation can be found. The sooner our country owns up to it's history. The sooner we can all move on.Neither denial by the established classes or anger, frustration, and laziness by the victims of racism will acomplish a solution."
4,I Liked The Book,"I just got finished reading this book. It was a real eye opener. At first, I thought the author lost his mind. After reading the actual sources he got these facts from. I felt Jesse Lee Peterson was right.It is a shame how we as African-Americans allow men and women who claim to be our leaders get away with being wrong and not hold them accountable for their actions. Here is one of many people who exposes the hidden agenda behind the modern civil rights movement.I like the fact that Rev. Peterson is honest about the issues in the Black community. As a Black male I feel most Blacks are not suffering due to racism but,as he says in the book,""lack of moral character."" Our ancesters fought hard and died so we can go to school;go out and vote;and get good jobs. Not all, but most of us take that for granted.I know the stand Rev.Peterson is taking isn't a popular one but his message is right for all Americans to read.D.M. New York"
5,One Star?,Who is posting these reviews? Somebody dosen't have an open mind or not being completely honest. Great Book! We need to bridge the race gap. Don't be a hater.
1,THIS AUTHOR HAS AN AXE TOO GRIND!!,I read this Book & Did some research of my Own. The man who Wrote this Book did so out of MALICE!... I am Not Defending the people he wrote about. The Truth is Obvious as This Man goes On a Campaign too Distort and Riducle his Own Race..... Starting with His own BackGround. The Book is Full of SENSATIONALISM. ANYONE Who wants The Equivalent of a Movie based on Trail & Error....By all means Have at this one for the Sake of ENTERTAINMENT!!
2,Some problems,"The basic premise of the book is a good one, that is, that blacks as a group do not need their own ""leaders"" per se and he exposes the evils and trickery of the current so-called leaders such as Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton and Louis Farrakhan. But I must agree with the reviewer who said that the book is poorly written. It sounds amateurish and Peterson devalues his own ideas by calling others ""stupid"" or ""crazy."" I found this unprofessional even when I disliked the same people.He also gets into peripheral issues that don't pertain to the issue of black leaders, for example, blaming homosexuality as a force in weakening black culture, anachronistic arguments that the man is the president of the house and the woman the vice-president or that Jesus Christ should be the basis of black men's values. These are his own values and don't necessarily pertain to the premise of the title."
1,"Homophobic, Self-loathing Drivel","I read this book cover-to-cover in one sitting at a bookstore. It's a lightweight, quick read. It took me 90 minutes (and I'm not a speed reader).Peterson makes a number of good and supported insights, but his credibility suffers when he talks about how white ""homosexuals are recruiting African Americans"" to engage in homosexual sex and spread AIDS. He espouses ridiculous, anachronistic and ignorant homophobic ideas. He suggests, in fact, that African Americans would not include gay people in their community absent the corruption of militant white gays. Say what?! Quite unfortunate given that other parts of his book are worth reading."
1,If he hates Nelson Mandela...,"In chapter one, Blacks Need No Leaders, Peterson writes, ""The last time I looked, Nelson Mandela was a communist-socialist pig.""If that's Peterson's opinion of Mandela, you can imagine his hatred for any other black people."
2,Who is Jesse Peterson working for?,"Let me start out by saying the book have good point of views about how blacks can be successful in American.However you can also put up on his one sided anti-blacks feeling.You can tell he is just a puppet.So who is the puppeteer pulling his strings.The question I like to ask who's funding his B.O.N.D. Organization?He continuous make the statement ""racial hatred against whites"".To be honest I think Jesse hate blacks.He is very confused.He stated in his book ""If white Americans were to leave the country tomorrow, in ten years America would be a ghetto.You can see the truth of this when you look at many of our major cities that are run by black mayors,black-dominated city councils,and black police chiefs"".If that isn't a hate statement then what is.Black police chief come that's a disgrace to a police chiefs period.Seem to me that is a racial statement and its definitely not patriotic.I'm not going to bad mouth him get the book and see for yourself."
5,What a Refreshing Read!,"As a life-long Democratic, I am saddened that our party leadership ignores men like Rev. Peterson. The message in his book is insightful and right on target. Unfortunately, our party leaders suffer much like the folks who once said that ""the emperor had no clothes."" I am embarrassed that we exalt the likes of Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton and totally discount other black leaders of Rev. Peterson's ilk."
5,Goes into territory few choose to tread,"Finally a book that lays out the real story in the black community without flinching. The courage that it must have taken for a black man to confront these things is unbelieveable! Rev. Jesse Lee Peterson goes right for the top leaders like Jackson, Sharpton, Farrakhan. But he goes way beyond that, getting into territory few choose to tread. Like the crooked preachers. They've been untouchable till now. He deals with fearful whites, angry black men, and dare I say--real angry black women--now that's real courage! All in all a fantastic read--real truth--even potentially life changing truth."
4,The Meaning of Company Accounts Reid & Myddelton,I am using this book as reading material for an MBA. I felt it could explore the deaper meaning of ratio analysis and its relevance within more industries. The size looks unitidy in my bookcase. But the soft cover certainly brought the price down and it hs proved invaluable as I have very little in the way of accounting knowledge.
4,As an Outline...,"This is not a book to learn tensor calculus from. It is an outline only, no greath depth or insight is presented. This book works perfectly as a supplement to a course in tensor calculus, or as a quick reference for the various techniques and concepts involved, provided one is already somewhat familiar with the material. It would be possible to learn the basics of tensor calculus from this book with some effort, and reflection on the implications of the concepts dealt with, however as a complete course in the subject it is insufficient, and I believe intentionally so.The more modern aspects of tensor analysis on manifolds are largely ignored in this treatment, but also intentionally so, an approach which I found useful practically.The book does not aim to be an all-inclusive course in the applications of tensor concepts to all areas of mathmatics, but rather a quick-reference guide supplementing more complete treatments, and as such, is largely successful."
4,Helpful in Learning Relativity,I have been studying a textbook in general relativity. A lot of the material that they gloss over is detailed in an understandable way in this volume.
5,Tensor calculus,"One of the best books you'll find covering the tensor analysis. Full of exercises, theory well explained and curious theory applications. Good purchase."
4,Tensor Calculus made Easy,"For those, like me, who want an easy and short way to learn the basics of TC, this is an excellent book. If you want a short and precise review, this is it. The section on applications to Relativity, which was my major interest, was good. Could have been better. Overall, very good."
5,Great book,This is a very usefull book for those one who want to learn tensor calculus with a lot of applications of Relativity.I enjoy it. An of course Amazon.com rules!!!!!
4,Claro y contundente,"Este libro te lleva de la mano, como cualquiera de la serie, para un mejor entendimiento del calculo tensorial, no lo recomendaría para se el texto principal de un curso, sino un apoyo para ejercitar y repasar, es bastante claro y de gran ayuda, ya que sus ejemplos y desarrollo son de utilidad para poder desarrollar habilidad en el manejo de la notaciòn tensorial. Puede ser de gran ayuda para un curso de metodos matemàticos de la fisica."
1,most confusing book,"it seems like the author do't know the difference between theorom and proof, ""proof: see the theorom, end of proof.""the book is ful of mistakes. it make me very tired reading that book"
5,Perfect basic camera,"I bought the A400 after many hours of research, where I debated the balance of features to price. In the end I got the A400 because it looked like a low cost, basic camera that would be easy to use in the everyday life situations I wanted it for. It has not disappointed. Perfect for those quick snapshots of life, when all you want is to point and shoot, not worry about activating the superFeature 500000A."
4,Good deal,"Good camera for the $129 I paid. Does everything pretty well, and your picture modes are pretty customizable. Only qualm is it takes a second or two longer than I wish when the camera saves/loads pictures to the memory card. Might be a problem when trying to shoot consecutive pictures-- but probably wouldn't be doing it with this type of camera anyways."
3,Canon camera and printer,well still having problems finding Ink.so it hasn't been used yet.I already gifted it.they have not used it yet.
2,"Great pictures & resolution. LCD died after 57 days, 3 hours","I bought this piece of junk in December, by March the LCD was history. Took excellent pictures and the videos were fine (all is relative...fine video from a 3.2MP digital camera)."
3,ok,"the camera worked fine but the printer never printed out a pic. it always came out blank then the ink was empty, i just did not understand how if nothing printed how the ink could run out. if i could do it again i would just get the camera"
3,bland songs from great artists,"This collection is not very inspiring. Though the artists are well known (deservedly) the trcks seems to be selected to be as inoffensive as possible. I have cd's of several of the artists, and it could have been a lot better. Try a Putomayo or Rough Guide compilation for a more sophisticated selection. Only get it for your gran, or nephew, or if you're only ever going to buy one cd of African music in your lifetme."
2,DJ EVIL DEE NEEDS TO SHUT UP!,"this is a great album that has been turned into something far less than that. I'd love this album if Evil Dee didn't have the same intro on almost every friggin' track ""...DJ Evil Dee is on the cut, come on kick it..."" or some crap like that. The Mos Def tracks are especially good, but sometimes the DJ just needs to stop self-promoting so f**king much!"
2,don't believe the hype,"Great songs, but DJ Evil Dee puts in your typically self-promotional mixing effort which isn't very impressive - and worse - is totally self-aggrandizing. Mixtapes are meant to convey a message from DJ to audience via the music but on Soundbombing, the DJ overshadows the music itself, reducing quality Rawkus jams to background filler for Evil Dee's excessive egocentrism. Soundbombing indeed - more like bombed sound."
2,230 Bismark cake tip,Great for inserting pudding and other sweet surprises into cake or cupcakes. I always wondered how doughnut makers do this and now I know.
2,phone cradle poor,battery charges okay but phone cradle connection poor fit and phone does not charge most of the time.
2,Broke after just three weeks,"I would've given this one star but the spare battery charger still works. It's a great idea, but the male receiver that the Treo sits on has now recessed itself into the plastic base and no longer sits up high enough for me to plug the treo in. I have two batteries which I now continually swap out with each other.And that blue light is obnoxious. They should have something more subtle."
2,not quite worth $20.00,"I had the same experience as another reviewer, it's easy to overlook in the description the detail that your phone will NOT charge with this product just by plugging into the wall, it must also be connected by USB into your computer, and your computer must be on, and then, buried in wires, it will charge. The real convenience of this product is that it holds my phone upright even in its protective cover, and it charges & stores my additional battery, which is small and easy to misplace. With all of its drawbacks, if you do a lot of work at your desk, especially using bluetooth, it eventually comes in handy to have your screen displayed upright & out of the clutter. Overall, this product is puzzling, it comes with no manual, arrives in just a plastic bag, and, while it's certainly cheaper than the $40 models out there, it's hard to tell if it's really worth 20 bucks."
2,Battery slot didn't work,"I bought this because my treo has problems charging -- nearly every time I plug it in, the light goes from red to green right away and it stops charging. The battery has actually run down entirely while plugged in. So I got an extra battery and this charger, in the hopes that I could charge one battery while using the other. The cradle actually worked better for charging the phone than the charger that came with the phone, though it still has the same problem. However, the slot for charging the battery simply did not work (and that was the main thing for which I wanted this item). I did have the cradle plugged into the USB port, and I did have the other line plugged into the wall. I took the thing apart to see if there were any loose wires, but I couldn't find any; the solder connections all looked solid, and the wires were all in place. It seems to have worked for other people, but the one I got was a piece of junk."
5,ACABO DE TENER A MI PRIMER BEBÉ,"y este libro, comenzó a ser mi cimpañero desde que supe que estaba embarazada...Me resolvió todas mis dudas y disolvió mis temores..Maravilloso si vas a tener un bebé ! Lo vas a amar ( Al bebé y al libro !)"
5,UN LIBRO INDISPENSABLE EN EL EMBARAZO!,"Está lleno de informacion, de la que jamás tienen tiempo los ginecólogos de darnos...Nos resuelve todas las dudas y nos acompaña desde la concepcion del bebé hasta su feliz llegada !Este fue mi libro de cabecera cuando nació MI TERCER HIJO...Y me hizo darme cuenta de QUE CIEGA ESTUVE DURANTE MIS DOS PRIMEROS EMBARAZOS !Ahora que nuestro primer nieto viene en camino, SERÁ UN FARO DE LUZ PARA EL EMBARAZO DE MI HIJA LUISITA !Se los recomiendo muchísimo...No importa que no sea su primer embarazo: Por primera vez contemplarán el proceso de dar vida en todo su esplendor !"
5,"Excellent, very readable text book","After being very frusterated with the assigned text for my EM class, Field and Wave Electromagnetics by Cheng (for me it was a bit like reading a conference proceeding, great if you are already familiar with the field of study, but not for a new student to it), I was leant this book by another professor. It is extremely readable, and it feels like a fellow human being is explaining these topics. Very comprehensible, and it seems a good deal of intelligence and thought went into the way in which the topics are explained. It has some archaic references (not problematic, though) and apparently at least one relatively minor typo. Overall, though, this is the kind of book that one should read in a first/second semester EM class. After partly reading this, Cheng seemed much more tractable. I have not yet finished the book, so I can only assume that the rest of it remains as good as the first 112 or so pages (the whole book being about 240 pages)."
4,vintage,This is vintage J Mascis stuff. Todays kids should check out this guy and forget about those louzy Radioheads and Coldplays of them. Shame on you todays kids!
3,"Average, only average....","Due to the fact of many good, already existing leopard gecko books on the market i expected a lot more ...it's a good book for beginners, for it is very easy and clear to understand, but nothing worth spending the money if you already own or have read books on the subject!"
2,Hit or Miss?,"My mother-in-law gave me this cookbook and I was anxious to try out some of the recipes to show my appreciation for the gift. However, many of the recipes seem overly exotic to me - and I am used to a wide variety of international cuisines. It seems to me that perhaps the author has sacrificed authenticity on the altar of innovation. I most recently attempted the banana cheese empanadas, despite my initial misgivings at the absence of fat in the dough. This is the first time I've seen a recipe for empanadas in which the dough consists of only flour and water. Needless to say, it was tough and flavourless. I have not had much more luck with the other recipes I tried, either. What I find especially irritating is the author's decision not to include photographs of finished dishes or diagrams of cooking techniques, but to showcase her own original, and completely irrelevant, artwork."
5,Wonderful recipes,These recipes are just wonderful. They are beautiful and easy. The artwork is delightful. Mollie Katzen is one of my favorite cookbook authors and TV chefs. Neat person - great books.
2,"Great idea, poor execution","I loved the idea of this thing, since sometimes I don't record notes in my Palm if the circumstances prevent me from opening it, turning it on, switching apps and writing them down. Unfortunately, they didn't quite get it right; I was prepared for it to be a bit thicker than the OEM cover, but the molding was badly designed so it was hard to open and close, and didn't even close fully. That might have been dealable, but the buttons are raised, and on the outside, which is convenient for using it but means any pressure on the front, even through the heavy neoprene case I bought, randomly presses the buttons and messes up your stored messages. I lost a few before I figured out what was going on. So, two stars for the idea, but I'd really, really like to see a version with the buttons on the *inside*, lockable, or somehow protected, and a better-molded case."
2,I really wish it was better.,"I agree completely with the previous reviewer. I love the ideaof voice recording quick memos and ideas instead of writing them down,and I think this function is sorely lacking on the Palm III. This attachment adds surprisingly little bulk to my Palm III. BUT, the exposed buttons are activated when it's inside my briefcase pocket (there is no off switch to prevent accidental operation), the fit is too tight and it does not completely close. I also think the speaker volume is a bit too loud and there is no volume control. As much as I'd like to have voice recorder capability, this product just isn't there yet. I'm hopeful Landware (or someone) can improve on this great idea."
2,Stop the beep.,"I've only had this device for a day but have comments. On the plus side, it has better voice quality and more memory than the Voice It Recorder I used to own. On the negative side, It's hard to flip the cover open. It makes a snapping sound while being opened and doesn't open as smoothly as the orginal Palm cover. The other negative--and my biggest comlaint--is the beeping noise when the buttons are pushed. I use the GoVox most often in a library, where I make voice notes from newspapers and magazines that I read. I speak softly into the device so as not to annoy other library patrons, but I can't supress the beep, although I try to by covering the speaker. Too bad the beep can't be turned off."
4,Good Item...but perhaps mine was defective...,"This urinal lasted all of 6 months while I was temporarily disabled. I got tired of throwing the cheep-o plastic urinals away. So I purchased this item hoping it would last. Unfortunately the handle ""broke"" where the handle was welded to the urinal. Mine may have been defective??? I do not know. I just thought a nice metal one like this would have lasted a lifetime...but it clearly did not!"
4,Great sneaker for an over pronater,As someone with problems with pronation - these sneakers have been great. My orthodics fit in them perfectly.I actually picked these sneakers before I went to the foot/knee dr - and when I went to see him he looked at my feet and said 'Oh the 854s - perfect'.
3,Hmmm. . .can we all be THAT ignorant?,"Maybe if you go to the regular ""STILLS"" album. . . there will be a listing of songs there.Do you think?3 Stars for the 3 overwhelmingly quick individuals listed below."
2,"Donnie Dacus, where have you gone?","This is that dead-dog Stills album that no one bought when it came out (for good reason) and they had a ""quad"" master laying around from the old SQ mixing. It really stinks. Its mostly Steve's newly discovered now washup/has-been Donnie Dacus. I am going off the LP; the CD must blow equally. As always, ""Your mileage may vary""."
3,"So, What?","There are albums that you hear, that you never forget. This is clearly not one of those. It is mediocre stoner rock, with the exception of the Opening Track ""Turn Back The Pages"", which is THE SHIZZLE and ""Shuffle Just as Bad"" which is passable, albeit certainly most retarded, but it's all scratched up. Stephen Stills brought his old CSNY buddies, Donnie Dacus and Dallas Taylor along for a ride, but instead they didn't ride anywhere... they just made a crappy album. My synopsis: So,What.-Ben Bitter, PresidentBen Bitter Music Express"
4,The highpoint the second trio achieved,"Different from other famous recordings by the Bill Evans Trio, you will feel the pleasure of listening to their plays in more relaxed atmosphere from this album. ""Isn't it Romantic?"" and ""The Boy Next Door"" are really good examples. These two tunes certainly posses something special that you seldom encounter in other Bill's albums. No doubt, ""At Shelly's Manne-Hole"" captured one of the Bill's best plays with the bassist, Chuck Israels, and the drummer, Larry Bunker. Although people tend to undervalue the second trio compared to the first one, this album explains that this perception is not always true. Listen to ""The Boy Next Door"" (this tune was played by the first trio when ""Explorations"" was recorded), then you will understand what the second trio achieved."
3,WARNING: This is NOT a brewing hydrometer!,Even though this shows up under the search terms 'brewing hydrometer' it is a SALINE hydrometer. It will NOT measure specific gravity of wort for home brewing.
4,my niece's christmas present,"not sure if she's had a chance to read it yet, but she seemed excited by it... I read it and think she will enjoy it."
4,Fantastic Story,"I love to read this book. It is quick and the jokes can be corny, but it is truly an entertaining story that is sure to amuse anyone in your life and I know that I enjoyed it for certain. However, I have only one complaint about this book: the pages give off a strong, unpleasant scent that sort of reminds me of cheese. (I am sorry, Marissa Moss, I know that it is not your fault). I am guessing that it is the glue used in the binding, but I don't always like to open up the book for this reason. I love it, and I don't think that the other books in this series bear the same smell, but otherwise you should definitely give this book a try."
4,first in the series,"Start here to be inspired. A variation on the graphic novel that appeals to upper elementary girls, especially."
5,Amelia writes everything.,Amelia writes everything in her jounal.Her mom gave her the journal the day they were moving.I think it is a great book.
5,This is a MARVELOUS book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is one of the most real books I've read in a long time! I can actually relate to it. Some people say it is not good for your kids. That is how kids are at that age, it's something they can relate to. They will not feel so alone. I wish she would just write TEN more books so I could read them all!!!!!!!!"
3,"Notebooks, Notebooks","Amelia's Notebook is a great book. It is about a nine-year-old girl named Amelia. Her mother gave Amelia a notebook to record her thoughts in. In this notebook, Amelia writes all sorts of things like: her family (especially her older sister, Cleo), her friends, and Amelia draws pictures in her notebook. When her family has to move, Amelia writes about her trip and leaving her best friend. I recommend this book to girls ages 9-12. I hope you read it!"
4,What's in this? Great food though,"I wish I knew what was really in this variety. It doesn't say much on the can. I toss this one in for a little variety, but it's not his favorite. He loves the carved versions the best, but he tolerates this one as one of those I use for a little change of pace for my cat. He appreciates it some, I think, but seldom eats the entire can. But I really would like to know what it consists of so I know what he's eating. The gravy sure looks nice and the pieces are a nice size as well - not too big so he can get it into his small mouth."
5,Love it,I am hooked. I had a friend that was using this product and had to try it. I love the sent of this shower gel/shampoo/bath. I love using it everyday. I can't explain the sent but it's sweet and heavenly.
5,Love it !,"It was a blind buy. I really didn't know the smell and I was very pleased when I received it. It's a scent I've never smelled before, but I love it !It smells fresh air, flowers, clean skin.Some people say that the smell doesn't last. I've only used it in my bath, and the smell stays in my bathroom for several days. Even when I take daily showers with another shower gel. Each time I enter my bathroom, it's the Amazing Grace scent that I smell ! On my skin, after a bath, it stays long enough for me : the evening (because in the morning, i take a shower anyway).What I must say is that I love Philosophy bottles. It's always written some nice stuff on it. Definitions, lessons of life, etc. I like reading them."
2,No longer the same product,"I love this product, but since I bought this on Amazon, Philosophy has changed the formula of this soap and it doesn't smell the same. I'm not a fan of the new smell at all and have stopped buying the product. Too bad because I really loved it."
3,ok but won't buy again,"Before purchasing this item, I did read the earlier reviews so I cannot say I wasn't warned. I found it true that the fragrance, however lovely, did not last. I did find it lathered well, using my shower pouf. What I did not expect was the astringent quality of this product.After using this product daily for awhile, I found my skin becoming very dry and requiring additional application of lotion (which also killed this product's fragrance).I don't need to wash my hair every day but after a few applications, my hair began to frizz out, as it was very dry. I guess the ingredients label says it all, not much but chemicals in there."
3,Drying,Love the scent because it smells so clean but this does dry my skin out. I could tell even after I used it the first time. Plus not very sudsy.
5,Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm,This product has the most femanine scent and all women need to pamper themselves and you should start with this product line!
5,Love philosophy body washes,Im always looking forward to my day beginning with philosophy body wash in the shower as it is the only body wash I found to be absolutely moisturizing and leaves a mild clean scent that lasts the entire day. I have extremely dry skin and these shower gels are nothing short of amazing of keeping and locking moisture in all day long. I have tried various scents and this one is among my favorites.
5,Great products!!,I love these Amazing Grace products. Great way to keep my skin conditioned and smelling wonderful.
5,Amazing Grace shampoo and shower gel,"My husband just loves this product. I bought it for myself, but we both use it. Smells great!"
2,Where is the fragrance?,"I was very excited when I received my order containing Philiosphy Amazing Grace Shower Gel; however, as soon as I opened the bottle I was in tears. The shower gel is odorless!!! I'm angry because I wasted money and time by ordering this from Amazon."
4,Philosophy - Amazing Grace,"Love the light fgagrance and how cool that it's a shampoo as well as a bath and shower gel. Will definitely order it again.Linda B.Camarillo, CA"
2,"It's O.K., but not worth the hype","It's O.K., but not worth the cost. It smells nice, but I found the scent didn't last on my skin or hair. The lather is not very rich either. The only thing that really stood out about this product to me, was the packaging. I like what it says on the bottle. I don't see myself purchasing it again."
3,"I really thought this would be ""Amazing""","After watching too many Philosohy promos on a popular shopping network, I finally decided to try some of their products. This was jus so so. Pretty color, which I can do by adding mica to any clear shower gel. Smell was nice, but doesn't last past the point of drying off. Small amount for the money. Did NOT leave my skin feeling moisturized. My Tone body wash leaves a much nicer feel, for a much nicer price."
3,Doesn't moisturize very well,"I like shower gels that make my skin feel hydrated after I get out of the shower... this one didn't deliver. It's a 3-in-1 combo (shampoo/bath gel/bubble bath) which I usually stay away from but it was priced right and Philosophy is a pretty good brand. Also, I know it's pink so I didn't expect it to smell masculine, but it smells really girly."
3,I gave this as a gift so...,I really did not get back much feedback from the person I gave it to so I do not not if that is a reflection on the product or the person to whom I gave it. Sorry
5,One,"I originally got this from iTunes because Azam Ali was one of the artists. I was not disappointed, it has all the mystery that I look for in Sufi music. It has the creativity of Mercan Dede's Nar, Very haunting."
5,"Best of 98. If you buy 1 CD this year, get this.","This is as groundbreaking for Hip Hop as the discovery of LSD was for Timothy Leary. Big Jus and El-P are badass...delivery is incredible. If you don't like this CD, you don't like hip hop. Fat, fat beats, big up to graff and NYC."
5,Headphone Hip-Hop at its best,"If you call yourself a fan of hip-hop and you don't own this album then shut up.This is the sort of music that would make your average eminem, or Jay-z fan screw their face up in disgust. It'll take about 10 listens before you even start to understand this but after you do it is up there with the best albums of all timeFor a ground breaking underground album by a nearly unknown group to win album of the year in HHC magazine speaks volumes.The beats are EL-p's finest ever, just as an instrumental album this would be genius, but the lyrics provide something fresh every time you press play. BUY THIS ALBUM NOW"
5,NO OTHER IS GREATER!,"co- flow is the definition of dope. big juss and el-p combine together to create the ultimate lyrical mastermind and mr.len hits us with some incredible cuts. these ""krazy kings"" are ahead of their time but will not be dismissed."
2,woooo in-de-pen-dent,"I bought this album, thinking it was cool...... I liked it for a while, probably too long. anyways it's not cool. or good for that matter. they aren't saying anything that hasn't been said before, people are just confused by all the big and nonsensical words el-p uses. big juss is pretty good, and mr.len has more talent than I want to give him credit for. but what more than ruins the album is elp's little doesn't-make-any-sense-but-sounds-'cool' pop culture referring whatevers, and the sound of the vocals is just numblingly horrible.. you may like it, but you'll come to your senses"
5,Crusher Plus it's Fun,This album is a definant banger from beginning to end.There is some great rapping on this album and there is some of El-P's best work to date on this album.This is one of the three biggest albums on the entire label with Black Star-Train of Thought.as all of the other reviewers have said the production is priceless and just banger after banger.Lyrics 10/10 Production10/10 X Factor9/10 Classic 10/10 Replay9Total=9.5 out of 10 Fingers
5,funcrusher plus indeed,"company flow? what the heck is that? sounds like some kind of newfangled farmin' equipment.... really, this is a tight album. it really begins to grow on you after a few listens. fire in which you burn has the sweetest beat you ever did see.. it hurts so good. the lyrics are interesting as well. check it out"
4,A great first-time read,"This was my first introduction to the wonderful Old English poem known as ""Beowulf."" I read it my senior year in high school and fell in love with it immediately. Its masterful handlings of such themes as honor, duty, fatalism, and death have a profound ring even so many centuries after its writing. This translation is very easy to read, but the one possible problem (depending on the reader) is that, while accurately translating the text, Raffel does not do very well rendering the poetic devices, namely Old English-style alliteration, into his verse lines. Still, you get the story and the themes, and for most readers that is enough. I highly suggest that anyone who reads this also read J.R.R. Tolkien's essay ""The Monsters and the Critics,"" a piece from the 1930s that explains just about everything about the poem, and is responsible for the place it now holds in English literature."
1,This book was very dissapointing and tiresome.,"Do not read the book. It is very boring, there are many confusing names and the content is weak. Beowulf is no hero but tries to be heroic.This book is an embarrasment to all readers young and old."
5,Killing the Dragon,"BR's translation in meter is awesome; the style of the book is neat, very slick and easy to carry around. The end is spectacular! Although it was written a long time ago, Beowulf's struggle and defeat over death resonates in many different ways even today."
3,"very confusing, but a good story",there are so many similar names which means it gets extremely confusing at times. don't let this review scare you. it is an excellent book that has a wonderful plo
2,Not the complete Beowulf I was looking for,"This wasn't the complete Beowulf that I was looking for. I read Beowulf when I was in school and I was looking for that version which was a very big book and the full, long version. Yes, it was a somewhat difficult read, but well worth it in the long run and I've been wanting to reread it for some time. Reading the reviews I had thought that this was the closest thing to it, but this isn't even close. This is a small paperback that is quite short."
2,so-so,"This book really wasn't that bad. I didn't exactly dread it, but I didn't look forward to it. There are 2 million names, and they all start with H, along with every building and country. It really doesn't have an interesting plot. Some dude comes and fights a dragon, then stuff happens that I zoned out during. But of course, it is an old poem and it has history involved. So if you want to read it, that will be ok. you will survive. I just don't recommend it to everyone."
2,Beowulf is boring,"This book is well written and a classic, but like most, it is extremely boring! If you want a book with the same them, but better, get Le Morte D'Arthur by Sir Thomas Mallory or Eaters of the Dead by Michael Crichton, which is based on Beowulf, but is more exciting."
3,"Beowulf, signet edition","Ehh, it was alright. I did like the vocab, and the description. Burton Raffel did a GOOD job with this book. (Although I suggest having a dictionary at hand.)"
5,Good work from NOTTY & Cheka,"Very good productions mostly from NOTTY & Cheka. 30 Tracks with the most important people of today`s reggaeton: Cheka, NOTTY, Don Omar, Baby Rasta y Gringo, Zion y Lennox, Yaga y Mackie, Ivy Queen.......The Tracks are mixed into another so there is no silence between them which is very good. I think it is a clean version because some words of 2 Tracks are ""reversed"". I don`t speek spanish so it`s OK to me.When you buy this CD don`t buy ""Reggaeton Biggest Hits"" because all of these Tracks (except 2) are also on the ""heavy hitters"" because it is the same label ""New Records"".Greetz from Germany"
2,Sammy Davis,The songs are okay but not what I expected. Most songs are from a live show and I wanted original recordings.
1,Not Sammy's greatest.,"This is just my opinion. I am a great fan of Sammy Davis, Jr. I believe he is one of the most complte artists of his century plus being a person whose pluses and minuses can be understod by all of us. I have most of his recordings. I think that this one was produced to ""catch the Croud"" and does him little benefit. The sngs are humdrum and the imitations are sophmoric. There are other recordings which better demonstrte his genius."
1,Sammy Davis Greatest Songs,The album was not what I had hoped for. The songs appeared to be recorded in a night club or similar atmosphere. The songs were not done the way the writer of the songs intended they be performed. They are Sammy's version for a night club crowd. I did not like what I received.
1,not for tai chi,So this would be great massage or maybe even Nia music but it is NOT FOR TAI CHI. As someone else already said it 'competes' with the movements of the form. Way too much middle eastern/indian influence. Too flashy with way too much synthesizer.
3,Spirit of Tai Chi?????,"Some of the tracks are alittle distracting while perfroming the Tai Chi form. They compete with the movements. It is not bad by any means a vote of 3 stars is appropriate. The ""Tao of Peace"" holds the number one spot for Tai Chi music."
3,not exactly what i wanted,these were not what i wanted and kind of flimsy ..but its hard to tell what things really look like online or in a picture...fast service getting it though..
2,Different from my expectation,"I don't know. I expect this book to have more information than it is. There's not much content but too many interview. In fact the whole book is all about the interview from different people in different architecture backgrounds.It may be a good book to those who want to knwo more about architecture, to architecture students who have never had internship before. Since I already worked for more than one year in architecture firms, I feel this book contains much less information than I expect.Anyway, it's just my personal opinion. Hope it helps."
5,Outstanding Career Source for Those New to the Field,"If you are exploring design careers for the first time, this book is a must read! Waldrep skillfully coalesces insights from various faculty, students, and practitioners in order to provide a depth and breadth that is normally missing from typical career guides. There is advice on everything from the definition of architecture to establishing a design career, and everything in between; this advice cemented my intent to apply to a graduate program in architecture and urban planning.I really loved the diversity of viewpoints expressed in the book. Modernists, neo-traditionalists, nontraditional students, traditional students, deans, and admissions professionals all have their own ideas about what attributes are necessary for a good architect, how to choose an academic program, and what employers look for. Finally, the text was so fun to read that I finished it the same day I received it and plan to read it again."
5,Very Pretty,"This is a very nice CD visor. The ""sprite"" is pretty, and it seems to be universal. I've used it in a little Nissan Sentra, and also in my Grand Prix. Good deal for the price."
5,I agree-- great teaching tool!,"We also homeschool and I found this series at a conference. My son and I just finished reading/discussing another in this series and loved it. We start this one tomorrow (but since I've read it, I'm reviewing it now).One *small* caveat: One of the cases is The Twinkie Defense/Harvey Milk shooting. Because Milk was openly homosexual, it is mentioned in the story. If this is problematic for you, you can easily skip that chapter. It's very matter of fact, though, so I don't expect it to be a problem for me when I read this with my 14 year old."
2,"Ok, but SBM-200 is better","This massager is alright, I bought it prior to buying a Homedics SBM-200. I find that the stationary massage points leave much to be desired. For double the money you get a much better massage with the SBM-200 since it moves up and down your back."
2,heat setting,I wish I knew ahead of time that you can only use the heat when the massage is on. My husband for instance just wants HEAT and he can't have just the HEAT. If I would of known I would of purchased a different one. So I could use HEAT alone!!!Other than that I guess it's ok.
5,Great Inspiration to both young and old christian women,This book was even better than the first and I can't wait to get copies of the rest of the series. A great read for young christians and older ones as well. Buy it for your daughters...they will love it.
1,Dated and Dull,I do not recommend this book at all! If you are going to start with a good Buddhist book start with The Joy of Living by Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche or A Path With Heart by Jack Kornfield.
1,"Missing first chapter, pages all mixed up but 5 stars for content and Amazon customer service","I'm not sure if this is just a quirk of my book or indicative of a wider problem but I just received this and the first page is page 37-68 then it goes right into chapter 2. So I went to page 36 hoping to retrieve chapter 1 from there with no luck... pages 37 - 68 are right there in their rightful place. So, be careful if you get this, make sure and check the pages before sticking it on your shelf to read later because by the time you get around to discovering the error it might be too late to make the return. Otherwise, content-wise, it looks like a great book and thankfully Amazon customer service has been very helpful about replacing it."
5,A clear understanding of eastern culture and philosohy,This book will hold your interest in a subject that most people wish to know more about..It takes the mystery out of the average persons understanding of Buddhism and Yoga...It is well written and hard to put down once you start to read it.It is a must reading for any one interested in eastern traditions..I highly recommend this clearly written text..
4,Error on box...,Upon careful inspection of the back of the box you'll notice that the box has an error - lists the episodes numbers contained as those for set #6. Too bad they ruined an otherwise flawless set with a typo at the tail end :( Maybe A&E will offer replacement covers???
3,Average,"This is a pretty decent flick. The acting is a little spotty in places, but is made up for by the leads. The special effects are suprisingly good given the budget. The story would've worked just as well without zombies, in my opinion, but being a zombie fan I won't argue at their inclusion.Before you sit down to watch this, just be aware of what you are getting. This is not a big-budget Hollywood movie, so don't expect it to be.PS: A note to reviewer J. Kramer - I'd say the acting and humor are more checkersy or backgammony than chessy. Or perhaps they're just a little cheesy. :)"
1,This movie was a stink of a DVD,"If you like zombie movies like Dawn of the Dead and Night of the Livining Dead. Avoid this movie. It has zombies. But that cant make up for the bad acting, stupid story plot, cheesy zombie fist fights, retarded girl with a fake looking head on her side that has no reason to be in the movie. And on a side note no one would want to have sex with a zombie for fear of contracting what ever the zombie had that turned them into a zombie. The only thing that I found interesting was the fact that the director added some of his movies he made in highschool."
2,Could have been better!,I agree with another reviewer below that this film could have had the same point without the zombies. It was a good try but in my opinion failed at a few levels. The zombie make up was pretty good but the pace and overall acting left a lot to de desired. Was it just me or did they not explain why the older sister had that living fact/head on her body?
1,AWFUL,I took a chance on an unknown film and boy do I want my money back! This film is awful from begining to end. The only good thing about this movie is that you can turn it off!! Save your money!!
3,Buy it for the pictures,"This is one of the very few books with an extensive collection of tansu photos. The cabinets are well categorized by their functions. Also very nice are the enlarged photos of tansu hardwares. I find the text to be somewhat poorly written and organized, and the authors' knowledge on tansu joinery/construction lacking. The hand-colored Japanese vintage photographs are also a little distracting. If you're looking for some nice tansu pictures though, this book will probably serve well."
5,"Prompt, fast, and exactly what I was looking for","The title pretty much says it all. I got it today, and I ordered it maybe yesterday or two days ago, and it was exactly what I was looking for. Thanks<33"
2,Not my style,"I really couldn't get into this book. I have read other books by H.G. Wells and found him to be an interesting writer, but for some reason this was not for me. I read a few pages and then gave up on it. Just really didn't want to read on."
4,Fiesta for the eyes!,"This teapot is just another lovely addition to my collection of cinnabar Fiestaware pieces. It is attractive as well as functional, and just the right size!"
2,Surprisingly shallow,"I had great expectations for this book, and it disappointed me to be quite honest. I expected the author to go much more in depth about her personal journey- instaed only a few pages are devoted to how it happened. Her ""humor"" is lost on me; she is judgmental of non-Orthodox: ""..only a half hour for Easter services"" line is an example. I am disappointed mainly at her chance to persuade and draw others to her faith. As someone searching myself, I am repelled by her attitude that permeates throughout the book. It left an impression on me like this was a really bad sitcom script. Her cast of charaters (parishnors) might be disappointed at her characterization of them. Finally, if you stripped away the borrowed prayer passages and song lyrics, this book could be cut in half. Could we not find these passages in other sources and instead focus on the building of her faith and her church a little more? We'll see if her next title is different."
5,An excellent resource.,"It all began when my roommate started dating an Orthodox guy. I was intrigued. I had never heard much about the Orthodox church, never thought much about the Orthodox Church. However, since that time I have visited their church a few times, including once during Pascha (Orthodox Easter). I was still intrigued, but I had a lot of questions, and nobody to answer them. ""Facing East"" helped. It didn't answer all of my questions, but it gave me a place to start. I'm not going to tell you that I'm going to convert to Orthodoxy because of this book. I don't know yet what I'm supposed to do about the Orthodox church. However, for those who are looking for something that will give you more of an idea of what being Orthodox is all about without having to struggle through heavy theological texts, this book may be just what you're looking for. It's light enough to keep one's interest, yet serious enough to answer some major questions. I highly recommend this book."
3,Wordy but Worthwhile,"This books shares a year in the life of an Orthodox mission church from a first-person perspective. It is certainly not a weighty theological treatise, and though a bit ""chatty"" at times (especially the first half of the book), it provides the reader a good look at an Orthodox congregation in action. If you want to know about the doctrines and apologetics of Orthodoxy, this is not the book for you."
2,Damaged book,Book was not properly wrapped. Its only protection was brown paper. Book was damaged through the mail.
1,Pure Junk,"I purchased two of these for my deck. They worked for 1 week, filled with water and shorted out.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
2,solar lights,"I ordered 6 lights, happy to find a discontinued item to finish our deck lighting. 3 out of six lights were new, 3 out of six were used. How do I know they were used? The parts were in a baggie not the original shipping bag. One had corroded battery compartment.After replacing the solar batteries, 5 work and one is faulty and lets in water from rain and won't work. We recycled the original shipping boxes and therefore could not return.So my review is mixed. Happy to find it, but not happy with receiving USED items when paying for new."
5,best of the bunch,"I've got all of ROllins' performances on tape, and this is by far the best in the group. If you've never heard his act before or if you're trying to decide which performance to buy, this is a good one to start with."
5,great product,really thick and good conditioner. it's specially good for course hair. the price was way great compared to the price in stores.
5,Pretty shaker set,Not much to review here. The shaker set is pretty and stable. Our old set used to fall over a lot and spill salt/pepper all over the table. The platinum band matches nicely with our stainless steel appliances.
2,Good but the diffactly messes it up.,Frist of all there is two resoans why this game got me mad. Frist the diffaclty you only get one or rarely get 2 cheack points and the levels are long and if you die you start either from the beging or you have to start by the check points and the cheack points are your 1/4 through the level. The other reason is to start all over when you die or go th the middle beging of the level. Then when you keep dieing and keep on doing the same parts and levels in the game you get sick of it and dont play it. Good try for a good shoter on the ds. Buy splinter cell caois thery for ds than golden eye.
1,What the...,"When I first bought this I thought ""Woah this must be cool"". But when I played it I lost so many times and it killed half of my brain cells so now I don't know what 1 + 1 is... Then I got so angry I poured water on it, stomped on it, threw it at the wall, then snapped it in half! So save your money and buy Kirby: Canvas Curse!"
2,"What smells?! I'll tell you, it's Goldeneye: Rogue Agent!!!","This game sucks!!! The gameplay is so very boring! It would be fun if it wasn't for (...) controls! The controls are a 0 out of 10!!! How can you honestly play a game with one of the worst controls I have ever seen... and I have the Nintendo 64, Super NES, and even the NES!!! (First Nintendo System Ever!!!) I also have GBA and GBC! Do you like moving and not seeing you are even going!!! It takes about a minute to move the (...) camera!!!"
1,Worst Game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I tried to play this game. the controls dont make sense. i think it is a bogus game.dont waste your money on it.
4,nintendo ds game Goldeneye Rogue Agent,This was for a 12 year old boy who looked all over town for it and couldn't find it so we checked amazon and found it.He was thrilled and couldn't wait to receive it.It arrived earlier then expected and he loves the game.
4,Great Game!!!!!!!!,Golden Eye Rouge Agent is a really exciting and fun game!! I recommend it highly!! Only downside is that it is kinda short and the music is ify......
1,Worst OO7 Game,"This is a bad game! Horrible greaphics,terrible gameplay, and many more!Good's:-Kinda fun killing-Thats it!Bad's:-Bad graphics-Horrible controls-missoions boringcant think!"
5,"Content great, condition less so","The heart of Christian doctrine, justification by grace, is expounded in Galatians and Luther is at his best. The book has much underlining and many comments in the margins which was disappointing."
2,an old version with not much currwnt info. Not described as so!,Didn't know it was an old version. Cruising guides are dependent on good info.
1,Holiday Miracles: A Christmas/Hanukkah Story,"This book was dissapointing not to mention BORING. There was no religious inspiration or insight. The story itself was pointless and dull. A child gets sick, the mother is feeling guilty. End of story. Save your money and give it to your place of worship. Better yet, give it to a food pantry."
5,"Coping In New Territory, A Handbook for Children of Aging Pa","This book saved my family. I read it, then got copies for my four siblings. When we came home to meet with my parents, we were all in agreement about how to support them, but keep them safe. Every chapter talked to us. It was as though Suzanne had been one of our family describing what we had all experienced. Thank heaven for this book. Our parents are accepting in home care and we can breathe easily about their safety."
2,How Does A Jersey Girl Know That A Guy Likes Her On A Date? He Pays The Toll! *2 1/2 Rounded Down,"VERY MINOR SPOILERS:Jersey jokes abound. Everything from ""Real Housewife's"" cracks to too much make-up and hair spray! All that is OK and even moderately funny, though the supposed Jersey accent is so over the top that it is annoying, not to mention closer to a Staten Island accent. Janet Ruth Montgomery who plays Martina Garretti, is actually a Brit (you may remember her as Eric Murphy's Assistant in ""Entourage"").While the show is un-offensive and mildly interesting, the reason I decided to DVR the 2nd episode is because of Janet Montgomery in a short skirt with heels and legs that go on.... Seriously, there is room for some improvement, though if I had decided to budget 44-minutes a week to a soft legal drama with a smoking hot raven haired lead, I would go with Sarah Shahi in ""Fairly Legal"""
1,IT DESERVED TO BE CANCELLED!,"I don't see any good reason for all these positive feedback...Am I missing something? Average actors, below average screenplay and below average directing."
2,"Good for bookshelf, not for learners","First of all, I never understood why the name of the book is ""How To ...."". All you get here some nice and spectacular pictures which contain some sort of water. This book never explained how to photograph various styles like stucco effect, rococo or cloudy effects. What are suitable film speed, shutter speed and weather condition required for a particular style. All you get here are what camera, what lens and what film used for the pictures. For taking water pictures, especially moving water, the most important thing is shutter speed. Choosing the shutter speed makes the style. Surprisingly the writer ignored it. If you want to get a book with beautiful pictures from all over the world, go ahead and buy it. If you want to learn HOW TO photograph water, DO NOT buy this book."
2,How to look at photographs of Water,"This book contains some nice photographs of water-based landscapes, but teaches little about technique, composition, shutter speed etc. for photographing water.Living close to the beach and waterfalls, I was somewhat disapointed in the content. Too much of the early chapters were taken up with general photographic principles and not enough specifics were provided on the actual subject - how to photograph water. Good pictures, but if you are looking for a comprehensive instructional source, this is not it."
3,as a recent parapalegic,the observations were more clinical than personal but I still was able to gain some understanding about the things I am experiencing and that was my goal when I bought the book.
4,Eye-opening and thought provoking,"I purchased this when I became friends with a man in a chair. I think it helped me understand better some of what he has had to deal with, and I hope it has made me a better friend to him."
1,Still Lives! How condescending!,"Right off the mark - What a ridiculous and condescending title. I'm a quad and my life is not ""still"". Not when I'm going to work as a physician & not when I'm chasing around my two year old! People with weakness or paralysis are not ""in chairs"" - many need to USE wheelchairs to get around - just like someone without a spinal cord injury might use a bike to go a long distance.Maybe we should leave the writing about people with spinal cord injuries to those who've had one - say, Christopher Reeves for example!"
3,I was satisfied,"As the seller had said, there was slight damage to the Dvd's case. But the DVD's themselves were in perfect condition. I was a little worried that they would be scratched or would skip. But they never did. :)I understand that cases get damaged, having damaged more than a few of my own, so really that was no problem. I was really happy to get such a product, with all the DVD's working just like new, and for a really good price."
4,Good collection,"I never mind humor in a serious anime but there are just some things in this movie that are so cheesy that make you wonder ""WTF?!"". An example is a guy creating a program to guess what underwear the main character was wearing and being able to use this program to help defeat a monster.....Other than too many cheesy moments, there was plenty of action, a good (though somewhat complicated) plot, and good character development."
2,Ring not so impressive,"The ring looks a little off--something with the metallic work. It's light in weight and the black onyx is not very shiny. I'd recommend you check around jewelry stores for rings that you like, since buying something that's going to be around your finger should be a perfect fit -- in size and in style. It's too hard to find on the Internet, I think."
5,Wow!!!,I have taken great pleasure in the Greatest Hits CD by the Thompson Twins. It had a song on it that I have wanted for a very long time.... One of the best CDs I have purchased. You won't regret spending a few dollars on buying it.
3,Another of the slender volumes in this series: A nice quick read,"Randall Bedwell has created an interesting set of slender volumes, collecting quotations of key Civil War generals and those who knew them. The volumes are quite brief, but--nonetheless--interesting to read.This is one of two volumes about Robert E. Lee. The quotations from Lee and others provide context. Lee's resignation from the U. S. Army? Here is the pithy quotation (Page 7): ""I cannot raise my hand against my birthplace, my home, my children."" As to his aggressiveness at Gettysburg (Page 18): ""If he is there tomorrow, I will attack him.""And so on. The quotations run from the outset of the war, through the Confederate defeat, and continuing through Lee's post-Civil War career.It's fun to read, although quite brief. A nice bagatelle!"
4,Real West Virginia Wild Food and Game Cooking,"Author Anna Lee Robe-Terry is a distant cousin of mine, who has written not just a book of recipes, but an evocation of the atmosphere of our northern West Virginia roots. Disabled by a chronic disease, she lost home, job and possessions until she moved onto the old Robe homestead in Marion County determined to survive. ""If life gives you wild grapes, then make jelly"" is her philosophy. She began investigating the wild plants that she had grown up with and educating herself in botany and the ways of the old settlers. Her recipes are wonderful just to read. I have tried the Snapping Turtle soup recipe myself and can recommend it as a definite change of pace from clam chowder. She also has a recipe for skunk (!) that resulted from a hilarious end to a hunting trip. I would recommend this book not only to people in the area, but those interested in its pioneer culture and folklore."
3,Missing an important point,"A beautifully presented book with many excellent drawings. However, the book cannot be accepted as authoritative, since the author completely ignores the work of the New Zealander Richard Pearse, who successfully flew and landed his heavier-than air machine in March 1903, well before the Wright brothers."
1,NOT for dyslexic children,"I think this book was originally called ""How to Teach Your Child to Read"" (or, probably, ""How I, Bernice Baumer the Great, Taught Your Poor Neglected Child to Read""). The ""information"" consists of a number of chapters that read like testimonials to her ""method."" The method, once revealed, has little or nothing to do with Orton-Gillingham, Wilson, or any other MSL technique. The method could in fact be very damaging to children who actually do have dyslexia. The author's attitude could be very damaging to parental confidence, since the author doesn't seem to recognise that dyslexia is any different from a ""slow"" reader, and posits that dyslexia can be cured in a few ""simple"" steps. As any parent of a dyslexic child knows, dyslexia is a lifelong disability that can be corrected and dealt with to some extent, but that will never be ""cured"" or go away entirely.(...)"
5,Great value,"I was looking for an Easter Gift for the boys since 2 of the 3 have Sugar diabetes, So i found these Converse Men's Team Respect style sneakers. So i bought them for 19.99 and the value was 79.99.Boys were happy and so was I.Great quality also."
5,A five-star compilation of old Ruben Blades work,"Most of the songs from this compilation of Ruben Blades music are from his ""Salsa Brava"" period, when he used to play alongside Willie Colon and other greats from the Fania All Stars lineup. There isn't a single weak song in here. The only thing that could deter you from picking up a copy would be if you already own the originals. Basically, if you have a copy of the ""Siembra"" album, you are better off skipping this one. Otherwise, it's a fantastic tribute to a great time in Latin music!"
3,Nice but didn't solve my problem...,"I've been getting some noise on my audio analog in to my home theater. It is coming from my HDMI cable, as when that is plugged into the system the noise starts. I was hoping this nicer cable would have better shielding and as such eliminate the problem. No luck; still getting noise (hum). Oh well. Otherwise seem like nice cables"
5,I Use These For My Samsung LCD TV Sound,"I plug these into the headphone out from my Samsung LCD TV into my M-Audio AV40 powered monitor speakers. Now I have very good TV sound with volume control from my TV remote. I DJ with some very fine top-of-the-line JBL speakers. All my line connections are Monster's. I am a big Monster fan. I spend more. I get more. My customers love my sound. When I want big sound from my TV, I connect my Monster Studio-Links from the L/R audio out into my mixer. Great for those music DVDs."
5,Great Cable...,"Overall really really great cable; very balanced. have them going from my pc to an onkyo m-282 amplifier to 2 JBL 2060's and the sound quality is of the utmost, i would even use these for monitoring for music production and i do sometimes. everything comes through crystal clear and no noise or feedback at all. all nuances come through ect ect...over all.......Great Cable"
4,"Good sound, don't expect to use 2 of them close together though.","These work wonderfully except for a single, major problem. All laptops have a mic and headphone jack placed about a 1/2 inch apart. These are so bulbous (round) that 2 of these cords can't fit next to each other. I'm going to have to shave off some of the plastic on each one just to get it to fit."
5,Perfect solution,Want to play your mp3 player at home without purchasing an expensive docking station/player? Use this inexpensive cable and play it through your home stereo! Can take it to other's houses as well. A great little product.
5,Great RCA Cable...Love the 90degree angle 1/8stereo plug,Great RCA Cable...Love the 90 degree angle 1/8 stereo plug AND the RCA inserts REALLY fit nice tight! I really recommend purchasing and using this item if you're a KJ or DJ
4,No difference in sound quality compared to generic,"I use these interconnects in place of generic one connecting Samsung Galaxy S with my NAD C326 amp with Polk Audio TSi 300 speakers.Please keep in mind that I am not an audiophile but I found no difference in sound quality comparing these cables to generic $2 interconnects.Regarding build quality, these cables are very thick and heavy with good solid thick connectors. In fact these cables are so thick that they require a little extra effort handling them in confined spaces like cabinets. I like especially the round male 3.5' connector. They look very premium and so I am not disappointed with spending money on these interconnects as expensive hifi system demands good loooking interconnects as well."
3,it works,i bought this product because i desired a connection btwn my stereo and ipod. i was a little confused by the options i had so i ordered one of both connections : the headphone connection { this one } and a competitors dock connection cables. i preferred the competitors simply for the fact that i did not have to fool with two volume controls. i did not like the connectors again cause on my stereo ( Sony lbtzx9) the largeness of these cable heads simply means a tight fit ) the positive were i could charge my ipod using the dock connection while playing it on the stereo- these cables using the headphone slot and the charger using the other one... so its your choice i liked these better -> --> --->Cables To Go 35507 - iPod Dock Connector To 2 RCA Cable
2,HOW LONG IS THIS CABLE???,"How the hell can you list a cable and not mention the length of it??? The ""8"" at the end of the item number might suggest that it is 8' long, but there is no way to know this for sure. For crying out loud."
2,Well made but treble roll-off on my system,"This is an *extremely* thick cable for RCA audio. It looks very durable, but noticeably colored the sound with a loss of treble. I was connecting an Echo indigo sound card (through the line out) to a Little Dot MK V Headphone amp. Stuck with the stock mini-rack to RCA adapter that came with the Echo Indigo and sound was much better. It may be that if you have an exceptionally powerful line-out you won't experience a treble rolloff, but I sure did."
2,Big Plugs,I have had trouble with both mini plug and RCA plugs. They are too large to use with my MP3 player and my receiver. They plug in part way and the connections are not tight enough to use. I think it is due to the large cable size.
1,LOL,"THX certification for a stereo to RCA connection?!?!?!?! what type of content are you using this THX certification for? an mp3 player?!spend your money elsewhere.... not on a 14 dollar 1/8th to rca splitter. only if the average consumer knew when they actually needed to buy a ""quality"" product"
4,Monster Cable thx mini to rca,Product arrived quickly and it is exactly what I was hoping for. Excellent sound quality.
4,maybe is too expensive? but is worth it.,i bought this for my Pentel pencil. is expensive but seems like this is the best one i can choose
5,PENTEL,This is good lead for fine lines and is hard to find in art supply stores. This tiny lead when used in high quality drafting pencils is amazing for drawing comic strips and yonkoma manga on standard copy paper to scan into a computer.
1,Pure Filth!!!,"This is unquestionably the worst reggae album I have ever heard. The only good song is ""Love Them Bad"", and that's only because of Buju. So the solution is; buy Inna Heights by Buju Banton and avoid this album at all costs!!! Do you hear me? For the love of Lucifer, don't buy this album!!!!!!!"
5,Oh Nooo,"Ich denke das diese Album eines der geilsten Dancehall-Alben überhaupt ist. Ich frag mich immer, wie kann so ein Junge so einen Flow und so eine Kraft in seinen Songs tragen und die Lyrics sind ja so wieso der Oberhammer. Ich jedenfalls kann es nicht verstehen, wenn man die rote Rate als Kleinkind oder als kranke Sau bezeichnet, wie ich es schon öfter in meinem Umfeld mitbekommen habe, und fiebere schon seinem nächsten Album entgegen,welches ja bald auf den Markt kommen soll."
2,WHAT CAN I SAY?,"THE MUSHROOMS ARE HUGE, AND DO COME IN A LARGE JAR, BUT MINE WAS ONLY 2/3 FULL.TO USE, TAKE OUT 1 OR 2 MUSHROOMS, SLICE THEM TO SIZE WANTED (REMEMBERING THEY WILL SWELL UP) AND REHYDRATE THEM IN COLD WATER.THEY ARE AN ODDITY, AND HANDY, BUT QU9TE EXPENSIVE, AS COMPARED TO THE CANS OF SLICED MUSHROOMS."
2,Not AT All what I was expecting,"They are great to look at. Beyond that...Eww! Them smell when you open the container is odd. I soaked some for chopping for pizza. While soaking them, my entire house was engulfed in this horrible smell. Thinking this was normal, as I have never used dried mushrooms before, I went ahead and used them in my recipes and had to throw the entire thing away. It tasted like the odor that was whafting through my house."
1,Volume being sold??? Pints or Quarts?,I know this is a great product but how much is being sold here? 2-pints or 2-quarts?
3,Not bad,"Not a bad product considering the limited amount of choices in Slovenian language products. The booklet is quite helpful, but the CDs progress too rapidly for a complete beginner. Very satisfied with condition of product, however, and with the speedy dellivery."
2,"Understocked, overpriced","I've used the book as a reference in neurology a number of times. On each occasion the contents provided a very nice general summary of the more basic information on the topic. Also in each case, critical and well established aspects of the clinical condition --- essential to decisionmaking --- were omitted from the text without even the slightest implied reference. Some of the missing information was ""new"" (last 4-5 years), much of it was not. A well written general survey of neurology for the medical student, the level of omission of significant or critical information suggests that even the family practitioner should exercise great caution in using it as a decision-making guide. Books that appear less complete, in the end, provide at least equal information and utility. Rated as high as 2* because the text is well written and the minimum of basic information is provided, though not at a level appropriate to a skilled neurologist."
3,Interesting reading for the train,"Good book for reading to pass the time, but not truly the career resource it claims to be. Many chapters are way too repetitive, and the organization of the book does leave something to be desired. The final chapter is the best part of the book (The web resources). Also, writer tends to use many abbreviations that a non-pilot wouldn't know, without explaining them. Found myself saying... ""Huh? What does that stand for?... and what does this section have to do with the chapter topic?"" and ""Ok... got the point already, can we move on?!"""
5,Really good Hip Hop album,Really dope album. Like 'Alkaholics' but better because solo album. Not bling bling at all but underground !!!! grab this one !
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed in this product. The signs were difficult to understand and the pictures were not great. Also, some of these were not the most common Mother Goose poems and there were only a few anyway."
3,Mother Goose in Sign,"Nice book, just not all familiar Mother Goose rhymes. Solomon Grundy, Thirty Days Has September, One, Two, Buckle My Shoe, Old Mother Goose, and The Crooked Sixpence. This isn't for babies. It would be fine for older kids."
1,Never heard of these nursery rhymes,"Solomon Grundy, 30 days has September, The crooked sixpence, Old Mother goose, One two buckle my shoe--I was looking for Mary had a little lamb, etc. I returned the book. (The sign pictures are fine--I was just looking for common nursery rhymes)"
4,Very entertaining,"A wonderfully entertaining and somewhat thought provoking work of ""tounge-in-cheek"" science fiction. Kind of reminiscent of some of Heinlein's work."
3,"Not bad, but not great either","I thought that this book was decent, but only decent. I can't really say specifically why, but I found the writing style to be a touch sophomoric. I never really got the sense that the protagonist was in real danger, and everything he wanted to do seemed to come too easy for him; I didn't find the villains terribly well-realized either.That being said, the entire book can be read for free, courtesy of Baen's Free Library, and it was at least diverting and entertaining enough to be worth ""free"". I probably wouldn't pay money for it, though."
4,"Real Good, not Great but a fine game","The sounds and graphice are quite well done, on par with other first person shooters like Splinter Cell and others. The AI is quite better than most making squad control a bit easier and not frustating as your troops don't run off and hide or do something stupid. There is NO XBOX LIVE which is a big letdown as it would have been wonderful to deploy and entire squad of troops together, or even two teams square off on each other. The overall presentation of the game is very well, done. Easy controls and extra attention to detail and physics really add to the game. no more unloading an M-16 into an enemy and having to reload as 1 shot kills you. Multiplayer is lacking as with most FPS nowadays. As said in another eview no ""bots"". This game is close to greatness but just misses the mark. Its still a good play and good replayability."
2,Please dont buy this game,"Send a message to the makers of MOH to stop putting out these crappy games buy not getting this game. Only Frontline was any good, and they seem to be resting on their laurels now. European Assault is repetetive, the AI reacts predictably, and the squad commands are limited and pointless. The areas of combat are based in reality, but the missions and battlefields are made up, id rather play Wolfenstein if i wanted that crap. Look, 5 years ago this might be a decent game, but since all the other WW2 games have come out like Call Of Duty, and the phenomenal and authentic Brothers In Arms have come out, it makes it seem that much worse. I dont usually write reviews for anything, but i felt especially passionate about this game."
5,One of the best blues album of the last ten years.,"Voted best blues album of 2000 by several european blues magazines, how come such a great record is so underestimated here ? This CD is definitly the best blues cd Mel Brown has ever made : stingin guitar, deep voice, original covers of great songs, very good band ; try not to surrender to ""Woman's wanted"", ""In the mood"" or the incredible ""I believe to my soul"". Please take a listen, you won't regret it !"
2,Largely disappointed,"Simply put, the music in this CD does not represent the songs/music in the movie. There are a few good tracks, but there's more rap than I care for. Hence, if you are a big fan of rap music, this might appeal to you, but I felt this ""soundtrack"" to be misleading and not particularly good since I naturally expected to hear more tunes from the show."
3,Great for Any Given Sport....,"The perfect CD for the athlete who need a boost of sonic ardenaline, who otherwise would have to settle for a compilation like, ugh...Jock Jams. Artistically, the closest thing to original on this CD is the Goodie Mob/Outkast gem, best described as Dirty South hip-hop for the next millenium. But it works...the only time this soundtrack slows the tempo is for the title track (produced by Jamie Foxx, with obvious reverence for the Nate Dogg/Warren G classic, ""Regulate"") Nothing too cerebral on here, but if you just wanna get pumped or get down, it's perfect."
2,I HAD THIS....ALSO I RECORDED... OVER THIS!!!!,ONLY ONE OR MAY BE THREE SONG'S...I ENJOYED...THAT'S ALL.
5,Best Soundtrack So Far This Year,Great songs. Put together very well. Deserves better reviews. I guess you just have to be a real rap or heavy metal fan.
2,Not Even Half-Time is This Dull,"After the quick moving, blood pounding way in which the music is presented in the movie, I was looking forward to having this CD in my car to roll and bounce down the highway. Alas, that was not to be. With the exception of the throbbingly insistent rhythm of Jamie Foxx' Any Given Sunday, the disc has no continuity. Apparently, the best cuts from all these tunes appeared in the film. On the CD, it just sounds like a mish-mash, with no purpose other than to sell these not-even-the-best-of tunes from otherwise dynamic artists."
3,str8,it was a nice cd...goodie mob with outkast? you know it's bangin...nore's track is slammin.....kid rock is wildin and mystical...ya'll ain't ready!
2,Where's the Willy Beamen Song?,"This soundtrack would be made if the Willy Beamen song was included. You know the one I mean, it was featured in the Met-Rx commercial and sung by Willy himself. It's too bad this fantastic song was trashed for something else."
1,"This is supposed to be a ""soundtrack?""","After seeing the movie, I was eager to get ahold of the soundtrack. Boy was I wrong. This soundtrack captures only a few of the songs that were actually used in the movie. I was extremely upset at what was a clear attempt to ""market"" this soundtrack as a rap/hard rock album than what it should have been, a soundtrack that stays true to the movie. What a commercial sellout by whoever put the soundtrack album together. I heard several songs by Moby and other dance/techno artists throughout the film, but none of their songs were included on the CD. If you are a fan of rap, which I'm not, then I'd recommend the album. If you saw the movie and liked the music from the movie, don't buy the soundtrack."
4,"Bless Me, Father","That song you guys are referring to is an extremely rare, unreleased song by P.O.D. entitled ""Bless Me, Father"". Unfortunately, it's only appearance is in the movie. They also recorded a cover of the Beatles' ""Eleanor Rigby"", however it too remains unreleased..."
2,disappointed,"where is all the techno/electronic music they played throughout the whole movie, (like fatboy slim's ""right here right now"" from the opening football scene)? This cd has way too much rap, and not the techno that was played throughout the movie."
1,Do they want us to buy our music used?,"Seriously, I came here to download ""Be A Man"" by the band Hole, and you're telling me that I have to download the entire album? Ridiculous!The only other songs from the movie that I even like are ""Party Up"" by DMX and ""**** That"" by Kid Rock, and I have those on their own releases."
1,Don't waste your money...,"Fer cryin' out loud. The big songs IN THE FILM aren't on this cd or on ""Volume 2"". Maybe there will be a ""Volume 3: The Songs You Expected and Paid For"" edition."
2,Not At All What I Expected,"I didn't realize that limited edition meant they were pulling this out of the vault!! The video appears to have been produced prior to the advanced technology in graphics and animation that we have today. Actually, I would say it is not animated at all, just still pictures and props with voiceover. Very disappointed."
2,Redesigned,Redesigned to be lite. Very good. The problem is the belt clip does not stay clipped. The old version was much better.
5,HAPPY,Couldn't be happier with the tire was quick to receive order it only took 5 days including weekend not bad. Very Happy! :)
4,"It was ok, a little confusing","I found this book to be helpful in some ways and in other ways, not so much. The sections on Mechanics were very simple and easy to understand. The Fluid Mechanics and Thermal Physics and the Waves and Optics sections were all easy for me to comprehend. This book was a big help in the Waves and Optics section because we didn't even go over that in class, but I was able to teach myself how to do it. As far as the Electricity and Magnetism, I thought it was extremely difficult to understand and after a while I didn't even bother with it, because I just didn't get it. I don't know if this would be my first suggestion for an AP Physics B review book, but it was ok, just a little confusing."
2,Barcode?,I don't know why but I guess it was from a LIBRARY and had its barcode on it. I thought its quality was VERY GOOD.
5,Chock full of info helpful for genealogists and those researching their family lines,"Great book with lots of information on organizations to contact regarding your genealogy research in every state. From government agencies, historical societies and others."
2,Ok for the price,It's a single panel since I see a few people putting that as a negative so I just want to be sure people know that. The door is flimsy I have had it for a few months now it's still holding up pretty well. The magnet that is suppose to close the door really isn't that strong you have to almost push it hard for it to close. But really what do you expect I paid like $15 I guess it was a deal then it's now $30 but it served it's purpose to seal my closet that had no door. Also like many reviewers here have said mine also came with a tear it's barely noticeable but it is their but it's not big deal. I really wouldn't recommend this product unless you want something basic it looks good just the functionality is not so good.
2,flimsy,"very flimsy ""door"". arrived ripped, exchanged it...and it arrived ripped again...didn't bother exchanging it after that. doesn't really stay closed well, if something brushes by it, it opens."
3,Cheap but working,"You get what you pay for. It is easy to mount and works, but does not seem solid.My major complain is that it arrived partially damaged (a cut near one edge), since it was cheap I did not bother to send it back and wait for a replacement."
1,Not worthy,"I didn't realize this was a single panel instead of double panel, so it is very thin. It was not packaged or shipped well and the top has pieces chipped off and the frame is cracked. Other than the breakage, this should only be used for closets or utility rooms that just need hidden from view. I'll be going to our local Lowe's or Menard's for my next one. (No Home Depot in my area, so I don't know about their selection/availability.)This was shipped from a 3rd party, not Amazon, and I continue to be happy with all my other Amazon purchases."
3,"Very attractive, but flimsy","This folding door is very attractive and easy to install. The door arrives ckaked and splitted at the botton edge, very bad packing shipping nohing protective, i didnt return to replacement becouse its not worthy, I installed it but I guess its not a durable material, I do not recommend this product."
1,Good Enough for Rental Property,"Purchased doors for a bedroom closet in a rental unit. Upon opening the package, I found the quality of the material to be very cheap. The material was split and cracked on the folds in the doors. I returned the doors for replacement. It is good enough for rental units."
4,Awwwwwweeeessssooommmeee,"This was a great movie from beginning to end , one of the ones not talked about but should - ( like bondock saints ) had a mix of everything well thought out movie a must have for any collector"
2,KEEP RUNNING,"I PURCHASE THIS MOVIE JUST BECAUSE I SEEN CURTIS JACKSON ""50 CENT"" IN THE LINE UP. I REALLY WISHED I HAD JUST KEEP RUNNING MY NET BY IT BECAUSE THE MOVIE SUCKS. I SEE OTHER VIEWS LIKE IT BUT TO ME THE ACTIONS WASNT GOOD AT ALL. AND CURTIS PERM REALLY NEEDED TO BE CUT DOWN MORE."
5,Work great and look nice.,"Easy install, insert the two screws (picture shows counter sunk but I got hex cap screws which I much prefer) into the spools and tighten, word of advice put Locktite in just to help put your mind at ease. Bought them to go with the Venom Sport Bike Lift Stands and they work great. Perfect for chain adjustment and rear tire removal. Recommend to anyone. Extremely fast delivery but the company was only located less than 100 miles from my house."
5,no. 1 health problem cured:carbohydrate addictions,"although kinesiology muscle testing techniques are not addressed, this is the most important medical book written to date on giving the body what it needs re minerals, oils, and organ meats such as liver to stop the vicious cycle of processed food addictions and mental illness leading to severe diseases. I hope to write a more comprehensive book on this subject soon."
5,Bounty continues to create the beat....,"First off, I wouldn't take to heart whatever MO has to say, especially when they cannot spell ""there"" correct. Bounty does and continues to bust it up......from me to MO..you a Battieman..."
4,"rise against the chillis ""bedouin soundclash is actually really good:""",I think bedouin soundclash is areally good band compared to other bands. Any who doesn't agree sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,mediocre soundclash,"i had bought this cd because i really liked a song on it. i had heard a couple other songs from other cd's and thought it would be a safe bet. it turns out this cd is very midiocre. there is one really kool song, but the rest just don't seem to evolve into anything interesting. the music becomes very 2 dimensional and lacks any real depth to it. i wish i had listened to this more thoroughly before purchasing. i wouldn't recommend this...."
2,Hey where is the light,"Well I will tell you the technology behind this is first class, but the point of a flashlight is..............LIGHT.this flashlight has enough light to the ground at your feet. THATS IT. VERY VERY DIM, any other light source drownds this and ensures you cant see it on. BUMMER this is a cool light."
4,As advertised,"Good flashlight overall. It's about the size of a 2D cell light with a nice white round spotlight, not as bright as regular flashlights. The light diminishes after about four or five minutes and continues to dim until almost 20 minutes. Only wished they added some more storage capacitors to make the light last longer since there's so much room."
4,A perfect addition to your emergency kit,"I picked-up one of these flashlights at a boat show for slightly less than the Amazon price, and am quite satisfied with it. Construction quality is very high, and it really does work as advertised. The clear case provides a ""cool-factor"", too.The ""bulb"" is a blue-white LED, and isn't quite as bright as a regular flashlight (hence, four stars). Still, it is quite adequate for general use. The brightness deminishes slowly over about a half-hour, but a few shakes brings it back to full power."
4,"Average, durable flashlight.","I bought this several years ago.It is not very bright, but it stillworks. Even in sub-zero weatherthe light works. There are brighterflashlights available, so 4 stars."
5,brings back wonderful memories,"During the late fifties and early sixties I went to school in Md and used to listen to the Harley show on WBAL. Harley played songs from his extensive collection of jazz, blues, and dixieland His theme song ""Sailing down the Chesapeake Bay"" was taken from this album and he drew heavily from the rest of the album in many of his shows. Harley moved to a different station in the 70's and I never heard his show again. I would love to buy some tapes of his show but I contacted WBAL and they couldn't help me locate any. Back to the album It is full of happy foot stomping music and I recommend it highly."
1,There are so many better choices,"I purchased this West Bend as an upgrade and a complement to my 'ancient' Rival, which still works well. The oval shape and removable pot give a lot more versatility, and ease of cleaning too. The stainless outer skin looks good.Well, the second time I used it (and it always seemed too hot, even on low) the switch sparked and it was fried. So, I called their 800 number - they don't want you to return it to the store - and they sent me a prompt replacement, along with a FedEx call tag. (I had to drive to a Kinkos to drop it off, because their call tag doesn't include residential pickup.)First time I used the new one, it boiled the contents in a matter of a few hours, and when I switched it off, it would not turn on again, even after it had completely cooled. When I returned it to the store it was originally purchased at, they didn't seem the least bit surprised.I think I would avoid this one!"
4,Good choice,I previously owned a Corning Ware Crockpot and had to replace it because my son broke it! This crockpot is wonderful! It is big enough for a family of 5. I use it for soups and stews every week. It looks nice enough to leave on the counter.
3,I don't know why she leaves him,"Spoilers**********This book shows how much un-pc the older HP books were willing to be. Although I still don't quite understand why Charlotte feels she has to leave, she does leave the island while Logan is away and actually leaves behind her son. She tells herself that her son deserves to have a father now and so returns to London alone. It's quite unheard of in today's HPs. Obviously everything works out, this being the HP universe.But really, 11 years? Ms. Mather often reunites her h/h after prolonged periods. But sometimes that time seems stretched too much."
1,Would not hold calibration.,"I have reloaded for years and have always used RCBS equipment. I have wanted an electronic scale for some time but was told the new electronic florescent ballasts were causing some problems with all scales of this type. I was told that this was no longer a problem. I purchased this item, read the directions and plugged it in. The next day I went through the setup and calibration procedure, as I started my reloaded scession I weighted each powder charge, toward the end of 50 rounds I noticed that the negative weight of the powder pan had increased. I then recaliberated and rezeroed the scale and remeasured all of the rounds, I found that I had powder charges up to 6 grains when I needed a 4.5 grain charge. Maximum charge for this load is 5 grains. This happened twice. I have returned this item to RCBS at thier request, I have not gotten it back. I hope I can change my rating then. All the rest of my new RCBS equipment is great."
3,"Excellent music, poor recording.","If you like Los Incas, you will like this. The music is excellent, but full of light pops and crackles like an LP. I still like it. If you get this, don't getGold CollectionThis has 14 of the same songs, with the same sound quality issues."
5,BEST ALBUM!,"One of the best jazz albums - heck, ANY albums - ever recorded. I don't understand why it's not available on CD, or as a download. PLEASE!"
1,Save your money. This thing is no good,"I do a lot of bacon, with a Taylor & Ng cast iron press on a 12.5"" T-Fal non-stick skillet.It occurred to me that this RR product -- designed for just the above purpose -- might be useful to have, so I bought one.Bad mistake!I did my bacon (as usual, on relatively low heat, for about 45 minutes slow roast) and after washing my new RR skillet, I found the non-stick coating already deeply split and falling apart in 3 places. The cast iron press has a metal handle that will burn your hand. With all her trademark orange silicone handles, couldn't she have given one to this cast iron press? That;'s a no brainer! My old reliable Taylor & Ng press has a wooden handle.So I just wrote this off as a bad purchase, after this single use.Save your money. Get a high-quality T-Fal non-stick skillet and a traditional cast iron press with wooden handle."
5,Sweet & Colourful,"A delightful collection of colourful country designs. Each chart offers a variety of small designs that can be mixed and matched to suit you. Because they are cheerful and bright, they are fun to stitch. I loved this book, the presentation is refreshing."
5,Simply country,I bought this book few years back and still flip it through from time to time. It is a lovable country cross stitch book. The instruction is clear with beautiful colors and all designs are really eye catching. You will not regret buying this book. It is perfect for someone who is really into 'country' home decoration.
2,stopped working 2 months after the purchase,This stopped working 2 months after the purchase.Amazon does not accept returns after 30 days. Ill try to reach out to COBY
5,Happy with mine.,"Very good price, and does everything I need.No problems yet with my older 28"" tvthe 5.1 sound is a nice perk for such a low cost unit, and it's compact which I likethis is the first real dvd player i've owned, beats the ps2 dvd player I had a few years ago hands down"
1,PAL doesn't work,"I specifically bought this because it said it would play not only NTSC discs but PAL. But I put in my PAL disc, and changed the setting to PAL and it told me it was the incorrect region. Which would be fine if it didn't say it was a PAL compatible player. My disc was from a different region but it was a PAL disc. All I want is to play my English movies but instead I have to return this thing. Sucks."
5,Cannot be put down!,"I first read this book when it came out in 1980. Recently, I reread it and was as enthralled with it now as I was then. Spanning nearly 40 years, this is saga at its best, weaving the story of a young daughter of a cook, Kelly, raised in Australia who marries the son of the family her mother works for. Some years after his death, she marries a prominent politician with 2 daughters - one an up and coming dancer and the other a political activist. Life for Kelly - and indeed, the reader - REALLY takes off from here, building to a really amazing and unexpected series of climaxes which left me wishing there had been a sequel AND a miniseries starring Lindsey Wagner!"
4,Great TV,"This television is a great example of Sony's quality. The 36"" set is big and heavy (approx. 220 lbs), but once installed the picture and sound quality are impressive. The color is accurate, and the set has several picture settings such as movie and sports which help tweak the picture to what is being watched. What is especially surprising is the superior sound quality from the two side speakers. I have the television hooked up to a component audio system, and in many cases, the TV's audio is as good as the component stereo's output, with the exception of a deeper and more resonant bass.This television has an analog tuner so it will not receive over-the-air signals when the conversion occurs in 2009, but it will continue to work perfectly for cable TV.I highly recommend this set. Probably all of these are now on the used market, but a well-cared-for model should be a great investment."
4,Excellent Quality,The product has excellent quality.Range of the remote is pretty good. The device was decently priced.Sound quality was pretty good.
3,Nice little product which lacks bass,"First of all I'm a big time JBL fan. I recently replaced all my car speakers with JBL and just love them.Coming back to the ""JBL On Stage II""... this is a nice little product. Wanted something to actually hook my ipod into after getting back from work to charge it. The unit is simple to setup and I did not find the adapter too bulky. It comes with an remote and has a nice feature to lock it if you are not using the remote.I have 2 complaints against this product:#1. This unit lacks bass. I played songs heavy on bass and was not impressed.#2. The equalizer settings on my ipod does not have any effect when playing music through this system.Something else I noticed was unusual... I have this unit hooked to my computer. When I switch the unit OFF (with my computer being ON) the ipod still remains ON showing that it is being charged."
5,Small sound system and fills up an appartment nice!,"JBL 2 is really nice for small spaces to play music. Would be greatly enjoyed at parties and does play well outside if you are not going to far away. The speakers can get very loud inside and if you do not shut off the remote when you are not using it, it looks like you can wear it down. Just follow the directions and you'll love it! I live on sail boat and it's really nice for sails as well. SPEAKERS HAVE AMAZING SOUND!"
4,"Nice product, good sound","We are very happy with this item. The only problem is that it does not charge the latest generations of Ipods. Unfortunately, this is a Apple issue and is a problem with most docking stations."
3,"Great speaker, but it do no charge my Ipod.","I have a Ipod Nano 4th generation. At the moment I insert my Ipod, a message is shown telling me my Ipod can not been charged."
5,Amazing speakers,"The JBL On Stage II Speaker and Docking Station for I pod has a great sound and in addition is very easy to carry on. Is a very good price for the quality of the sound. My friends and I, are very happy with this."
5,Excellent Ipod docking station and speakers,"I bought this unit in Dec. 08. I like the sound quality and easy of use greatly. The built seems to be very solid and I have no issues with the unit at all.Good: price - I paid $47 for it. I felt that it was a great bargainsound quality - clear in all the range, volume can be all way up without losing fidelityEase of use - simple and responsive buttons for changing volumeLook - clean and functional not bulky or square/old lookingLike to have: Control - Will be nice to have light on the button, can not see it in darkColor - Hope to have more color selection, black/silver is ok but not exciting at allOverall, it is great quality and good buy."
4,Great sound,"I bought 2 sets on black Friday. One of the AC adaptor had poor connection and won't work. I tried to call JBL's warranty service but the complicated phone system really confused me. Finally, I e-mailed their service department and surprisingly received very quick response (within a few hours) from a ""real person"". He ordered a new AC adaptor and arrived my home 5 days later. This speaker is small but the sound is clear and powerful. Do not expect a lot of base. You must plug into the wall outlet in order to turn it on (no battery powered). Even you turn off the power button, it can still charge your i-Pod."
4,Satisfied Customer,I was really satisfied with this product. I had a really small space that I wanted to put it in and it fits perfectly. Don't let the size fool you..it packs a lot of power. And it is very versatile as it works with every type of Ipod.
4,bought as a gift,"small and sleek, sound is good, takes up little space, bought as a gift for someone who already has a dresser full of things like telephone, cd player, alarm clock/radio. no space for a big ipod speakers. we shopped around and this was definitely the best for what we needed"
1,Should Be Pulled From the Shelves,"This won't charge newer ipods or iphones or the itouch. 3 were bought as Christmas presents, they are all being returned because it won't charge our ipods. I called JBL, they said I should have gotten the On Stage III. It charges new and old models. If there is a new model out, why is this still being sold? It's especially troubling when the package clearly states that it charges all ipod models. At the very least, slap a sticker on the front of the box showing what models it is compatible with."
4,Excelente producto,"El producto es de excelente calidad, su sonido es de una calidad media ya que no podemos darle volumen adecuado porque se ahoga y el sonido baja de calidad.Debe venir para uso con baterias tambien."
3,Not disapointed at all,"I cannot say its an outstanding amplifier but compared with the similar from other brands, the JBL is great. Good bass, good volume. It distorts if you push the volume too much but is a very good ambient sound. The remote is not very good though it demands a little pacience.If you're looking for an ambient sound with no hi-end expectations it's the one. If you want to power a party look for something else."
4,"cool sound, easy to carry","Very good sound from my ipod, and low weight, but the remote doesn't work well if the docking station is near to something metallic or an electric device. Despite that, i'm very happy."
1,"Nice Sound, Poorly constructed.","I have been through two of these speaker docks so far, and both have had something break. The first dock's remote control stopped working within 2 weeks of me buying it. I exchanged it for another one at the Apple Store, and it worked fine for 4 months. Then the dock stopped working properly, meaning when I attempted to use either of my iPods on the dock, the sound would be fuzzy unless the iPod was held in a certain position. Disappointing."
2,50%,"I bought one. Worked great. Still works great. Bought a 2nd, which crapped out 3 months after purchase. Just stopped working one day. Didn't fill out warranty so it's not Amazon's fault."
3,Sounds great but doesn't charge new iPods,"Great unit, sounds great for such a small unit, but didn't realize it was an older model and won't charge the newer ipod's and iTouch. Says it charges all iPods, but that was at the time it was sold, so it doesn't charge the newer models, plays them fine but won't charge them. Bummer"
5,the BEST ipod accessory EVER!,"this is hte best ipod speakers you will ever get. JBL sound is amazing! i take mine everywhere, sure I wish it could be battery operated, but its nothing to deter you from getting this one. with video ipod it works like a tv! we use it in hotels, on cruises, anywhere you want to watch your videos, either outloud or plugged into headphones. the sound quality is amazing!!! sure the only one that has better sound is BOSE but that one is about $400 and its huge! this one is small and compact, the remote works great and clips onto your belt, shirt or pocket, this little system is so sleek, and it charges your ipod instead of having to connect it to the computer! if you are looking for ipod speakers these are the only ones to get!"
4,works well,This is not to be your main speaker. It is small and the sound is a bit screechy. But for small tasks -- like background music for falling asleep or having a cozy dinner -- it will do well. Main problem is the bass. Cannot possibly deliver good bass. But it is a very good system if your expectation matches its size.
2,Doesn't charge newest ipods,"I returned this and got the 'P' version (all black including the speaker screen). The new version charges the new ipods (new nano 4G, itouch, iphones). Plus it's shielded so it doesnt screech when u have an iphone attached to it and u get a call."
4,GOOD SOUND,This has a good sound. I'm not sure I love the shape. I do have a different speaker system for my ipod that I use at work and I like the shape of that better but this one has a better sound. When you are close though most of them have a good sound but if you want to go across the room or use in a large room this one has the sound for that.
3,Great sound / does not charge new nano,"Great sound for such a small system. VERY upset that it does NOT charge the Nano 4th gen. I would not have bought if I knew. It says ""charges ALL docking ipods"" Well I called tech support and they said that this is an older model and it does NOT charge the new ipod nano. Other than that, this is really a great product, sound and quality."
3,Does not charge new ipods!!,"Good sound, but I am VERY disappointed that it doesn't charge the newer nano. I wouldn't have bought it if I'd have known that."
1,don't buy it,"This product worked well for 2 months and then it just stopped working. It won't play any music at all and is essentially the biggest waste of money. When it worked, the sound was very good but alas it did not last long. Don't be fooled - it's not reliable."
2,Software problem,"I purchased this item and an Ipod for my mother for Christmas. The sound is great on the item and she loves the ease of use.However, this item will not charge the newest generation of Ipod. When I asked JLB they explained that Apple changed their software so it wont charge. To add to my frustration, they didn't offer any assistance on this matter but blamed Apple for the problem.This defeats half the purpose for this item, so the Ipod just dies on the speaker system. With the level of service I received from them I plan on never purchasing their products again."
4,Good Sound Quality,I was very surprised for the price how good this speaker sounds. Even at high volumes the sound is crisp and clear. The only down fall is that it does not charge my IPOD 5th generation Nano while it is playing. If your looking for something that isn't too overly priced this is a good buy.
5,Psychonauts bible...,"I have to disagree with the ""other"" reviewer who no doubt works at the Salvia Shoppe. Salvia must be concentrated in order to give a strong effect as the leaves are just not potent enough. Personally, I'm not crazy about the stuff...it doesn't have the spiritual feeling that other plant materials have for me. Traveling is something I do when out of the US as other countries are not as rabid about legality.If you're looking for the SHAMANIC info (which is key as this isn't a psychedelic enclyclorpia here) on plants this will awe, entertain, and inspire some journeys across the border and elsewhere. Many plants are not ""schedule"" as they are in the good ol' US so may be easier to obtain and explore without worry. There are actually Ibogaine clinics for heroin addicts in the UK and Mexico, and other such viable places to explore a full on Shamanic experience. This isn't the recreational users type of stuff here. Much more depth than that!"
5,Dated But Still Useful,"First published fourteen years ago, this guide is in obvious need of an update, as other reviewers have pointed out. I still have my old copy, worn and dog eared and value it as an encouragement for the individual to take control of his or her spiritual quest through time and shamanic honored cultivation of plant allies. A new addition might take into account ""ayahuasca tourism,"" which I recently observed in Cusco, Peru. Lots of folks down there are hanging out their Shaman shingles come one come all, which brings up the question of authenticity vs. cheap exploitation of an ancient native ceremony."
3,Modestly useful book.,This is a nice book giving a general overview of the subject matter. There are however more sophisticated and complete books on the subject. Since the book was written in the nineties this is no surprise.
3,Decent Price,I wish I could find a chain coated with industrial diamond. At least these are not the very low kick back design so you can cut when they are sharp.
4,does well,dont know where they are made but they seem to hold up well even with my abuse hate this word addeding
1,dull,THIS CHAIN SAW BLADE IS SO DULL IT WOULD NOT CUT HOT BUTTER. I USUALLY DO NOT COMPLAIN ABOUT A PRODUCT. I ALWAYS SAY BUYER BEWARE. BUT THIS ONE IS SO BAD I HAD TO SAY SOMETHING.
1,Terrible Fit,"Do not but, it totally misses the fit in my Odyssey.Web site stated it was for this carbut it is not true,I will have to go get other brand."
5,Delco Gas Cap,"If you drive a foreign car, then this might be the cap for you. Works nicely for cars that it fits. Delco is the same one who makes all of those wonderful car parts and car batteries.I like to stick with companies that I know."
4,check for the O-ring gasket....,"These are great for Chevy's. Just check that it has a O-ring inside the gas cap above the threaded area. Some cars require a complete sealing gas cap or you will get a ""Check Engine Soon"" light on your gage in no time. And this could lead to costly repairs in the emissions control systems."
4,Good gas cap at a decent price,I needed a new gas cap for my 2003 toyota tacoma and since I park it outside I went with a locking gas cap. It's a perfect fit and comes with 2 keys.
5,Great history reference,"A single huge book that outlines world history in chronoligical order with all civilizations represented. Events are recorded in news article format. One can turn to a given date in time and read articles about what was going on in Constantinople, Tikal Bangalore and Rome in that year. All matter of fact with little or no modern revisionist bias."
4,very entertaining 70's tv,"What a great show this was and is. Set 7 includes Bringers Of Wonder in which really gross and goopy aliens take over the base by appearing to be the loved ones of the people on the base, but Koenig can see them for the slimy creatures they really are. Landau gives a wonderful performance of reacting to their true disgusting forms. This is not serious science fiction, but Landau is excellent, and the other cast members give it their best too. The goopy monsters are amusing and also pretty darn disgusting and creepy. The glops of slime oozing down the eyes of the aliens is a great touch."
3,The Second To Last Of The Sets...Space:1999!,"SPACE 1999: Set Number 7 is the second to last in a series of the episodes for the second season. I must admit these episodes are interesting but the overall acting needs a little to be desired. Catherine Schell and Tony Anholt really are trying, but with all the fake monster outfits and bad one-liners - its almost funny.Technically again the show looks good. The costumes got colorful and they try and shoot lasers almost every episode. Its is interesting how the try to FORCE the humor in the show and it doesn't come naturally with the characters.The comlocks, eagles and Stun Guns are still cool. See my reviews of the other 6 sets and the one to follow. I really did love the first season - and fell out of love in the second. You decide."
2,Needs improved,"I haven't had a cat yet that liked this one. It's just a little too interesting for them I think. It smells nasty but I think it's just the taste that really gets them. My current cat just won't touch it - he might eat a couple of bites if he's REALLY hungry, but I always wind up throwing it out. This one is ground so if your cat likes pieces, don't try this one."
4,An excellent read.,"""Pincher Martin"" might be any man who has sailed the seas or been in combat within 360 degrees of nothing. I've been a fan of Mr. Golding and recently revisited his ""Pincher Martin"". It is a book about struggle, and survival and perhaps the inevitable outcome of war but it is mostly about a man, one man, and his overwhelming need to live. I found, while reading the book for the second time, that the story has lost none of its vitality nor its ability to terrify. I felt the motion of the boat, the bite of the weather and the stark reality of the island. This book proved to me Mr. Golding is a master story teller. I recall, when first I read this book, wondering why it wasn't on the best seller lists. I still wonder about that."
3,What Happened?,"This is one of those novels which, when you finish reading it, will leave you wondering: what happened? What does the ending mean? Which of two realities/possibilities occurred? Some people enjoy books and movies of this nature: they like the twist or trick, perhaps. Me, I hate books and movies of this nature. I don't like being left hanging. I like to know the answer to ""What happened next?""On top of not liking the ending (if you can call it an ending), I didn't find the main (only) character sympathetic, so I didn't enjoy spending the entire novel in his company. But Golding is a great writer, able to create a vivid, believable world and to show people trying to survive under the most dire of circumstances. Because of that I have to give this book three stars rather than one. And I note that others like this book, so for some readers it's a very good book. If you're considering reading this, I suggest you read several reviews of it beforehand."
3,Great reference or information read,Book was just what I needed: a reference book. Became interesting and informative about the great state of Arkansas with many things many do not know!
4,"Silly title, great content!","This is my favorite basic book on wine, the title is silly, Id feel better carrying it around if it was something more serious, but the content is great. The information is good and its layout in an easy to understand way, there are also fun recipes and things."
1,Will not charge after only ~10 charges - Money down the drain,"I bought this along with my D80 Kit in Circuity City. I hardly used this as I was always using the original Nikon battery. I used this only when I put the Nikon battery on charger. I would have charged this maximum of 10 times and always followed the instructions (do not leave it on the charger, do not let it completely drain etc).Now, it won't charge. When I put it on my Nikon charger, the light blinks for some 5 min and goes off. I can shoot some 5 pictures with whatever charge it gets and the battery is fully drained.I would highly recommend staying away from this product"
2,Incompatible with Nikon D300,"Charged with Nikon's charger overnight, unloaded voltage at 8.25V (nominally rated 7.4V), yet if I insert it into either the Nikon D300's battery compartment or into the D300's MB-D10 battery pack the D300 displays the ""low battery"" icon and refuses to turn on. Have tried specifying the D300's battery has priority and the MB-D10 has priority, to no avail.I've read the Nikon EN-EL3e has additional circuitry to determine battery lifetime, I am guessing there's additional circuitry to identify a genuine Nikon EN-EL3e, and that the D300 will refuse to work with 3rd party equivalents."
1,died after little use,"I have two other batteries for my Nikon D90. Both perform well, but this off brand died after little use.I am going to try a Pearlstone replacement which has received good reviews."
1,Battery died after 3 recharges,"I have purchased Nikon D80 from ebay and this battery (last time buying non original batteries) from BestBuy. After first charge battery life was pretty short (less than 100 photos without flash). I told myself ""fine, you can't expect non original battery to be perfect"". After 3 recharging cycles battery died completely. Still I was not sure who is culprit: my used camera or the brand new battery. I searched Internet, cleaned the battery and camera as people advised. Nothing helped. Then I ordered new original battery from Hong Kong for $60 (compared to $100 in Toronto). In couple of weeks new battery arrived. After 3 weeks of extensive use no problems. Therefore, there is nothing wrong with the camera. Sadly, it is too late for returning it to bestbuy.Conclusion: stay away from non original batteries, in case you can't afford the price in Canada do shopping in Asia."
3,Bob Scobey's Frisco Band with Clancy Hayes,"Although the music was great, I am not much for vocals with Dixieland music. Do you have any Scobey music without the v ocals?"
4,More roles for women,"True argues that the rapid and massive changes in Czech society after communism fell also included new roles for women. The change from a statist economy, mostly plugged into other countries in the Warsaw Pact, to a free market economy, exposed to global trends, was abrupt and severe.She suggests that women could now expand their gender roles by taking initiatives in a capitalist system. Changes in how families were viewed, and in the political system, and what this meant for women are also discussed."
1,jan powell a song in the air cd,I ORDERED THIS ITEM AND WAS SENT A CD WITH NOTHING ON IT. I CONTACTED AMAZON AND REQUESTED THEY SEND A REPLACEMENT AND CHECK THE CD FOR CONTENT BEFORE SHIPPING. THEY SAID THEY WOULD I RECEIVED THE REPLACEMENT CD AND DISCOVERED I HAD BEEN SENT ANOTHER BLANK CD. THIS IS A CD I WANTED AND STILL WANT BUT AMAZON'S FAILURE TO CORRECT A KNOWN PROBLEM AND THE MANUFACTIURER'S SHIPPING OF BLANK DISKS MAKES THIS AN ITEM TO BE VERY LEERY OF TRYING TO BUY.
5,This is a book that I take out and use every Christmas,"I am now ordering my third copy of this book to give to another relative who wishes a copy. I have had the book for more than 5 years and use it every year for Christmas cooking. Every Christmas Eve, I prepare one of Susan Branch's recipes and everyone's mouth waters in anticipation. This is the best book a Christmas lover could have. It's also a wonderful recipe book for those who are not fond of complicated Christmas recipes. This year, I made the Bread Pudding with Whiskey sauce for the first time and it was out of this world. The illustrations are fun and by now, I know the text better than Ms. Branch. Highly recommended."
4,Christmas from the Heart of the Home,"I already own this book and wanted one for my mom. It arrived in almost ""hot off the press"" condition.Susan Branch's books are always delightful. Christmas From the Heart of the Home provides not onlythe charming art work but some very good recipes that are easy to make. It is filled with Christmas joyas well. Touches the child in all of us."
4,Yum...,I've had this book for years and used it every holiday. Wonder recipes the family loves. Great ideas for you home. I like the art work in the book also. A must have for the family and a book to pass along.
3,.,"The book is just what I wanted, although when I ordered, it was pictured with the book jacket, however it arrived without one, which was disappointing. I think I should have known that the jacket was not included."
3,a bit disappointed,"I was disappointed because I ordered a new book and paid quite a bit for it; but, when it came, the cover had several large scratch marks across it and the edges were slightly upturned, which dimishes the attractive cover designs."
4,Excellent buy.,"When I first received the package in the mail, I was pleased to find everything well protected and boxed nicely. Upon cutting open the box, I found the pentacle inside a black velvet bag, which was kind of a nice surprise even if the bag was sorta cheap. Anyway, after pulling out the pentacle I found that it is actually very visually pleasing and not as cheaply made as some of the reviews make it out to be. It does however, rattle very softly, but that is an easy fix you can do by bending the clip that holds the stone in. It is moderately weighted and I find it comfortable for daily wear. Honestly, I love it and I'm really glad that I bought this pentacle in particular instead of one of the plain punched steel ones. It has a lot more character and the stone is beautiful by itself. The pentagram is well made and the details on it's face are clearly visible. I'm already really fond of it and I do plan to wear it everyday. Blessed be."
4,Dodging some aspects of Dodgson,"This is a very erudite book and Cohen knows a huge amount. I would have given it five stars except that I do think he dodges the issue of Carroll's sexuality. Cohen tries to tie up the unhappy diary entries Carroll made around 1860s with the contacts he had (or didn't have) with Alice at that time. But they just DON'T tie up, and it reduces Cohen's credibility that he tries. Carroll was a very unusual man and very much part of his historical era, so hard for us to understand, but now Karoline Leach has put 2 & 2 together (not necessarily making 4) it does seem time to move on from the old Victorian vision of asexual ""Lewis Carroll"" . (And, as a fan of Carroll's works, I'd be glad for the world to move on from seeing him as some sort of paedophile!)So I really wish Cohen had addressed this."
3,What now?,"This book seems dated now and we need a new edition as another reviewer has said. The commentary on Alice Liddell needs to be updated following Leach's work. Some of the claims he makes have been shown to be based on dubious data or to be mistaken, and he needs to modify his text to take account of that. But in many other ways this book is indispensible."
3,very sturdy handles but easy to wear through,I bought two of these for two different size griddles I bought. The griddles are so heavy and have edges that will wear through this canvas material in no time at all if you have items stacked on top or below the griddles. The bag handles are strong enough to support the weight of the griddle though so just be careful if you have objects stacked on the griddle that wil rub on the canvas
5,The perfect roasting dish,"I previously owned a corningware, which was accidently broken, so I was extremely excited after unsuccessfully looking for a replacement; I finally found one with a bonus casserole dish also for less than my original dish cost alone. Yes I've been cooking up a storm with it, and more than pleased."
5,Cute Thanksgiving Book,"This is a cute Thanksgiving book patterned after the old ""Twas the Night Before Christmas"" story. It is in rhyming verse, yet flows nicely.It starts with the Thanksgiving preparations the night before, then moves on to the morning parade, family arriving, playing football, making pilgrim hats, preparing food, eating, and leftovers.There is an entire series of these books for various holidays. I also have the Halloween one, and it's just as cute.My children enjoy reading this book, and so do I."
3,Good Fun Video,The video is English over Japanese with script. But good footage and some good driving. Probably OK for the price.
3,"Good, but quite dated...","A clear, well-written and easy to understand guide for the student or practitioner of the law of Employment Discrimination. Now the bad news: it's v-e-r-y dated; this guide was published in 1986, before the 1991 Civil Rights Act, before the Americans with Disabilities Act, and before many groundbreaking Supreme Court decisions that have reshaped how courts look at employment discrimination law. I would recommend either Prof. Lewis' ""Civil Rights and Employment Discrimination"" or Prof. White's ""Employment Law and Employment Discrimination"" hornbooks, which are just as accessible and much more recent."
5,The best book on Lebanon,"This piece of historical literature is perhaps the best book to date on the history of ""Lebanon"". Professor Salibi's synthesis is an essential read for anyone who's seriously motivated to understand, however, for all of those fuelled by bigotry and hatred, it would only add rage to ignorance."
3,History that took alot of research,"It is a good insight to Lebanon and its history. This book has mix followers, however all would agree that the writer is well reputed."
1,Don't waste your time or money on this book,"Salibi writes from a defeatist point of view. He does not support many of his claims with reference but gives a personal opinion. Thanks to modern genetics, Salibi made a fool of himself by making seriously unfounded claims in this book. It is a shame that a person who is supposed to be scholar wrote irresponsibly. Don't waste your time or money on this useless book."
4,Deconstrcution of classical maronite Lebanist arguments,"At the same time, a very professional scholarly work and an enjoyable read. Good at setting the middle eastern context of Lebanese history.However, the author seems to take sides when he is deconstructing the classical Lebanist version of history (such as the muslim religious persecutions, the mountain refuge, and the Shehabi state), as all his arguments go in the same anti-Lebanist direction."
2,"Very few new facts, disappointing.","A good account of the modern history of Lebanon. The author shows he is clearly an expert on 20th century Lebanon and the intricacies of modern lebanese politics. A major flaw, however, is the abscence of any significant reference to the massacres of 1860 (an attempt perhaps to minimalize them). More importantly, his reinterpretation of the history of the Maronites before the 19th century is not based on any new facts, which strips it of its scholarly value. In this regard the book becomes a vehicle for the author's opinions without adding much to what is known about lebanese or maronite history. He would have done better had he concentrated on Lebanon in the modern times."
1,Biased Point of View,"Mr. Salibi is known to create his own history and dismiss facts that might not serve his point of view. In this book, the events that took place in 1860s are not mentioned, which is very strange. These events are a turning point in the modern history of Lebanon, however since they create a justification for the creation of Lebanon in its current state and borders, Mr. Salibi chooses to omit them.I found it also ""funny"" that Mr. Salibi made a great effort to prove that the Maronites are Arabs while it is widely known and acknowledged that they are direct descendants of the Assyrians and still use the language of their ancestors in their mass.For any serious reader interested in the history of Lebanon, I suggest instead: The Breakdown of the State in Lebanon, 1967-1976 by Farid El Khazen (a very objective and serious piece of work)."
5,A great read for pet lovers anywhere,"I just purchased this book a couple of weeks ago and I read it in one night. Mr. Gethers does a great job telling us about ""his little guy"". He is honest and interesting, and he is very funny. (I was laughing out loud while reading about Norton's first plane trip). Most importantly, he is a very faithful friend to Norton. Norton gives a lot in return. It is impossible not to fall in love with Norton while reading this book. So, I raced out to purchase the next two Norton books but only the third book was in stock. I am almost done with it, and I have to say it is just as good as this book, if not better. I highly recommend both books. Read them - You will not be sorry. I have the feeling the 2nd book in the series is another winner, and I will pick it up ASAP."
5,What does a Cat hating Baseball Writer know about life?,"Well he learns a lot, from Norton. Who is Norton why the cat who went to Paris.This book is a must for those who do have cats, and those who claim to dislike them (but we know they secretly like them)This story chronicles a part of Gethers life, and how he is able to deal with things, and how many people feel about their pets.Norton, becomes such an intergral part of his life that he chooses the Cat over women, places to travel to and where to stay. Not bad for a cat hater.You will find that not only is Norton a cool kitty, but his owner thinks so too.The book is a must!"
3,Cat owners will understand,"What Peter Gethers shows here is the extent to which man (or woman)and cat can bond, and how surprising such a connection is for a person who has previously disliked cats. The feline just may be the ultimate pet, and for those who don't own cats or fear them, this story of Norton and his adventures might be a little too cute (and incomprehensible). It's a very personal book, and not everyone may like Gethers. My biggest complaint concerns the blue squiggly lines at the bottom of each page on my copy of the book.Definitely not deep reading, but funny if you can relate."
2,Cheetos for your brain,"I have the deepest sympathy for those reviewers who felt this was the best book they have ever read. Those types of remarks speak volumes about the reviewer (!), but nothing about this book. While it was pleasant enough, only someone raised on a diet of American network television could mistake this for literature. Having four cats in my own home, I could identify with Norton - who was by far the most appealing character. Unfortunately, the author fills most of the book with the descriptions of and anecdotes about a vast array of seemingly vacuous and self-absorbed ""beautiful people"". Who wouldn't prefer a cat to this crowd?I suggest if you really are a cat lover, buy a supply of Pounce, get down on the floor and spend some real quality time with your ouwn feline(s), or donate the cost of the book to your local humane society."
4,The Travels Of Norton,"Norton, is a credit to Scotish Folds. And Mr. Gethers know excatly how fortunate he is in having the most Purr-fect of friends. This a joyful read of a cat who just can't help be lovable, and who loves the people he meets. Apparently some cats do on some level know exactly what's going on."
4,Perfect for my Powerbook,These sound so much better than I thought they were going to! I'm so stoked to have a solution/alternative to my Powerbook's crappy little speakers. And can't beat the price!
5,Better than expected for the price,"I was looking for speakers to play my MP3 player on at work. The speakes designed specifally for MP3 players were smaller, had less audio power and were more expensive. But then again those speakers are designed to run on batteries and since I plan on keeping these near a power outlet that wasn't a necessity for me.These speakers plug right into my MP3 players headphone jack and the sound is wonderful. Plus they look great to boot."
3,good but with a few important reservations,"1. There's no treble or bass controls, just volume2. There's no headphone jack3. You REALLY need to use your computers software graphic equalizer to get the best sound out of these speakers.If you use an equalizer with a little effort you will get great, clear sound from them.That's a lot of reasons why these speakers may not be best for everyone. The price is a bit high for speakers that have no controls on them."
4,Perfect for an office,"These are a perfect set of speakers for an office where you're not looking to blow anyone out, but still looking for decent clarity and sound. Not heavy on bass, so definitely not the pair for heavy bumping, but who's looking for that in an office."
4,Great Sound!!!,These speakers are amazing!!! they are very high quality and have a very nice sound and also ger very loud.I HIGHLY RECOMEND THESE SPEAKERS!!!
1,lasted approx 2 weeks,"i really liked these speakers for the first 2 weeks, then they started crackling and the sound became more and more muffled until finally, after a few months there was a ""pop"" and they just stopped working all together. they look pretty, though. i am bummed and wonder how i am going to return them since i no longer have the box. i knew the price was too good to be true!!!!"
1,Blah sound overall,"I was really excited for these affordable speakers after reading the rave reviews, however, I have been extremely disappointed in them. I may have had too high of expectations, but these things put out NO bass whatsoever (it just sounds muffled and cruddy), and the overall sound is extremely poor. I'm really surprised as I've owned JBL speakers in my car that I was extremely pleased with, so I'm amazed at the lacking quality in these. I would recommend either finding another similarly priced set with good reviews or paying a little extra and getting something with a sub included."
1,Don't Buy!!,"The JBL Speakers worked fine for 3 weeks and all of a sudden, they quit. In the future, I will buy this type of merchandise locally so that I have some recourse."
5,*Para Grupo Bryndis*,Me encanta el Grupo Bryndis!!!!!!!!!!duermo y hago todo con su musica ha todo vuelo*I LOVE EL GRUPO BRYNDIS*
1,Bush take christianity and twists it into a weapon,"Christianity is based on peace, love, etc. (I happen to not be Christian though)According to Bush god told him to become president. This man must be hearing things from taking a little to many drinks or god wants the apocolypse to be now. Bush takes his faith and twists it into a weapon. He bases everything in what i call ""Insane Conservative Christianity"" in which the only rule is, if your christian you can do whatever you want and god forgives you. This man must be stopped."
1,a naive book,"A man can pray and think he walks with God and stilltake the country into an unnecessary war with Iraqfrequently lie that the war somehow makes America safer when the National Intelligence Estimates tell us our occupation serves to recruit and train jihadistssponsor policies and legislation that degrade the environmentfavor the rich over the poor---and this despite Jesus' frequent condemnations of the wealthy, especially the selfish and wealthy.As long as there are enough Americans who believe that religious automatically means good, there will be a market for silly books like this."
1,A joke,"Blessed are the peacemakersLove thy enemiesThe meek will inherit the earth.It will be easier for a camel to walk thorough the eye of a needle than a rich man to get into heaven.These arent direct quotes but are some ideas expressed by Jesus Christ, the same man this hypocrite claims to follow. To say that George Bush is a faithful man is so blatantly stupid. Its sad that people in this country can be subdued into believing that this man is a Christian. It seems to me that people who claim themselves to be religious have chosen nationalism over religion. If it makes you feel better to vote for someone who has murdered thousands and thousands of people by saying he is a christian, fine, answer to it when you die."
1,Actions speak louder than words,"Formalized/organized religion is great if/when it leads one to true spirituality. For many however it seems to simply be a list of dos and don't prescribed to them by previous generations. A connection to god is reflected in ones connections to humanity. It is shown in ones abilities to give of themselves to others and in ones ability to empathize with others. Bush may have gone through some transformations in his life and he certainly knows the ""religiously correct"" way to speak, but I don't see evidence of a true spiritual journey within his actions. I hope for his sake and for ours he is someday able to find his way."
2,painfully boring,"I love W, but hated the book. There are enough snippets and stories that I hadn't heard before to keep me mildly interested, but the author writes in such a dull style that I couldn't read more than 5-10 pages at a time. It's like he can't relate an anecdote in less than 3 pages. Plus, he's so obviously a Bush fan that the book reads more like campaign literature than a real work of biography.I had really high hopes for the book, but was disappointed. Somewhere out there is a ""Faith of W"" book that's as well-written as ""A Charge to Keep."""
1,MAKING MONEY OFF GOD,Its is unreal that you sell and try to make a quick buck of a BIBLE that is free in the kingdom halls or given if asked for free from Jehovah's Witnesses preaching door to door. Shame on you!
1,Chasing the Mountain of Light : Across India on the Trail of the Koh-i-Noor Diamond,"The author should have added the words ""MY MODERN DAY DESCRIPTION"" before the title.Not only is this book typically a westerner's view of India, it has all the historical facts probably gleaned off Google itself. The inter-personal activity with the different people who helped on his ""so-called"" journey feels more like a Merchant Ivory movie plot than anything substantial which is not available on the web.Don't buy this unless you don't have access to the internet or can't type ""Kohinoor"" on the Google or Bing search engine. Total waste"
4,strange story,"great travel book and weird subject. I've seen the koh-i-noor in the tower of london, but i didn't know about its history. Rushby's travel writing is excellent [check out his other book on the yemen for another weird treck with the arabs], and the diamond bits were very interesting - looks like Queen Elizabeth might be getting a few indians at her palace door asking for it back soon!"
3,"i enjoyed it, but where can i find more on the diamond?","this was a really interesting book about india and the story of the koh-i-noor diamond which is in the british crown jewels. I really enjoyed it, particularly the historical detail on the diamond's amazing history, but i'd love to know where i could find out more about it. I'm going to london next year , so maybe i'll go see it."
2,Good for beginners,"If you are an experienced clinician who has been in the field for some time, this book will not tell you anything new. This is a great book for graduate students still learning about creating a safe environment and reporting but does not offer anything new to the experienced clinician. The activites are also focused for group sessions, which was disappointing since there was not any creative interventions for working with boys on an individual level."
5,IT gets no better,This has to be the very finest in reasonable priced beautiful watches. The parts areswiss and very fine.Assembly is in Germany.The catch is magnificent.Worth all of 1500.Justin.
1,Do Not Buy This Watch,"The very first time I wore this watch the claps on the band feel apart.I contacted the seller requesting a replacement band.After a week I have heard nothing from the seller.Since the watch is now unwearable (unless I go to a jeweler and replace the band at additional cost) I now want to return it foa arefund.I am very concerned that if the band is so badly constructed, then so is the watch.I am also disappointed in the lack of a response from the seller - this is unacceptable customer attention."
1,don't spend the money,"I agree with the other reviewers. This is a good movie, good cast and story, but this DVD version is awful. The picture is grainy and the sound is barely audible, not worth the time or money , wait for a new issue."
1,CLASSIC MOVIES,VERY DISAPPOINTED. THIS VIDEO IS VERY HARD TO HEAR AS IT IS MUFFLED AND SOME AUDIO SKIPS FOR MORE THAN 2 MINS. EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. NOT A GOOD PRODUCT .
2,Charming Story Deserves Better,"This is a charming, well-acted, warm story that deserves better than the poor quality reproduction here. The color is washed out, the sound dull. Too bad, because it could be a real joy to own."
2,Madacy Strikes Again!,"I don't understand how Madacy got the rights to make this DVD. Everyone knows that their quality contol is non-existent. But the movie is a wonderful classic and it is watchable; although the video is washed out and the audio muffled. For the price, and if you're not too picky, you might consider buying it anyway."
1,Shoddy,"LIFE WITH FATHER is a great play, and this movie version is good, but this DVD is of poor quality. For one thing, the sound track is not synchronous with the movie, which makes it exasperating to watch."
1,Life with Father dvd,The quality of this dvd is very poor. Picture was not clear and color was faded. I had been trying to locate this movie for some time but was disappointed in it's quality.
2,This DVD is of very poor quality,"Although this is a great old-time movie, don't buy the current DVDs of Life With Father.From what I read of other reviews, there is no current DVD version of any good quality.When we tried to watch this, it was blurry like you were watching it through a frostedTV screen, and the sound track was so muffled we couldn't make out half the words. The sellerwas nice enough to send me a refund. Maybe some day they will produce a quality edition ofthis classic movie, but till then, don't buy this one."
3,This film should get restored,I really liked this movie when I saw it on cable a number of years ago and have been hoping to find a good quality DVD of it. bought a DVD copy that was unwatchable (not through Amazon).Much to my surprise yesterday I saw I could watch it on Netflix using their 'Watch Instantly' feature. Thoroughly enjoyed the content of the film but sound quality still was below average. Picture quality was a little better than the audio. Like I said I hope this movie gets restored someday. In my opinion it is that special.
2,Love the movie-Hate this copy,This was a replacement for the movie that I wore out. The quality was really bad and I had to return it.
1,Life with Father,This movie was very disappointing. We were expecting a good old classic. This is a very silly movie with little plot. Even the 'big names' don't help at all.
2,life with father,"Love this old movie. But the copy I got wasn't very good. The picture quality was bad, very dark in some places. Also in one scene, for about 5 minutes, there was no sound."
4,"""Life With Father"" a fun romp in days gone by.","""Life With Father"" is found to be more funny with each viewing. A nostalgic and fun romp in days gone by, William Powell and Irene Dunne are the Lucy and Desi of yesteryear. I recommend everyone see it with their children, so the younger set can glimpse what life was like ""back in the day"" and gain an appreciation for the conveniences and lifestyle of today.Life With Father - 1947 Color (Digitally Remastered Version)"
2,Terrible transfer and sound,"Although this is better than the unwatchable Madacy DVD, it still is horrible. There is 60 Hz hum throughout the audio, audio that is distorted and clipped, and a rather grainy, noise full video print. Max Steiner's inventive variation-on-a-theme music score is ruined.If this is the best that can be done with this delightful movie, it is a true pity.Someone, please restore this to glory."
1,Hey Criterion! Where are you when we need you?,"I agree with the other negative reviews on here. The film itself is a delightful 5-star classic, but the DVD by Madacy Entertainment is inexcusable. I paid just $4.00, but I still felt ripped off because I only watched 6 minutes and 44 seconds before I had to turn it off. It's unwatchable. The picture is grainy, the colors are washed out and the sound is a garbled mess.Save your money until a proper release or if you still want a copy email me and I'll send you my copy via a catapult."
1,"Unhappy with ""Life with Father""","I really expected a studio copy of this great movie. Instead I received what appeared to be a cheap copy of a copy. Poor sound, picture quality. It didn't even rate a 1 star rating. We returned it and were pleased with how fast our refund was posted to my credit card.Sincerely,Erik D. Gosswiller"
3,Movie gets 5/Madacy gets 1=average 3,"This is such a great movie. I jumped at the dvd soon after seeing a beatiful broadcast on satellite a few years ago. Print was immaculate. The Madacy dvd is just class-action criminal. I will never buy another Madacy anything. Everyone here seems to agree, but I see evidence of at least one good print. Can anyone point us in the right direction? It's tough to turn someone on to this movie with out of synch noisy audio and laughable color reproduction."
1,Terrible quality DVD!,"The movie is WONDERful - but this particular DVD is horrible!! It's very fuzzy and the sound is so muffled. It really has the qualities of a 'bootleg' dvd. You can find the movie by other distributers in much cleaner, clearer condition. The movie itself is timeless, adorable and so charming - just purchase it from another distributer."
1,subtitles,"This DVD had terrible sound quality. An Englich speaking movie should not need subtitles!!It was very difficult to hear any conversations. What a shame because it this was one of my all time favorite movies!"""
1,cheap subtitled movie,"this dvd did not meet the quality of other dvd's purchased. the sound quality was poor,at best. Unclear and did not match the characters lined"
3,Better Than My VHS,"I bought this DVD because my VHS format is awful, but I HAVE to have this movie!! The sound quality is a little muffled-ish. It reminds me a lot of the normal ""old movie"" sound quality. Don't freak out when it arrives in a black and white case. The DVD IS in color. I absolutely love this film, and I'm quite happy to own it on DVD."
4,"excellent,funny movie","william powell is great.myrna loy is fantastic in this story of a family run by a strict dad..but really run by a not so strict,but smart mom"
1,Get the digitally remastered version,"The audio on this version is atrocious, warbly, hardly understandable most of the time, and even drops out in one part of the movie. So I splurged and bought the digitally remastered version, and it has fantastic audio. So don't buy this version - ONLY BUY THE DIGITALLY REMASTERED VERSION. Let my lesson save us all some money - then it's worth it to me."
1,What a waste of money,"Anyone considering buying this version of this wonderful movie, DON'T DO IT. The sound quality was so bad I could not understand anything being said. The picture quality was also poor - the colors were washed out. I guess you could say I learned my lesson - I won't buy anything again without reading the reviews written by others who bought the product."
2,Life with Father,"I ordered 3 dvds of the movie Life with Father. I bought these as Christmas gifts and I watched one myself and I was dissappointed. The quality was as if it had been taped right off the tv. I asked the about the other 2 copies and was told the same thing. What are you going to do about this?Sinerely, Pat Bedson"
2,Poorest Quality,"This movie although old, is of the poorest quality of all the old movies I ever purchase. If I had known it was going to look and sound like it does, I would not have bought it."
1,QUALITY,"The video and audio are so poor, it is unwatchable. It is like to a 10th level copy. I have seen the movie on TV with an infinitely better quality, so such does exist."
2,Not worth it!,"I was so looking forward to watching this wonderful old movie again. Stay clear! The sound quality is awful! Made trying to watch a real chore, not an enjoyment. Don't buy until there is a better version. Video quality no the greatest either."
1,Life With Father,"I received the DVD is a timely manner. I was anxiously waiting for the right time in order towatch the movie. When that time arrived I put the movie in to view and to my surprise, thequality of the movie was very, very poor ! Needless to say, I was disappointed !!! I don'tthink I've purchased a movie before with this result. I would like to receive another copyof this movie because I've always purchased items from Amazon.com and have been very pleasedwith my purchases. Sorry but I have to review it as the POOR QUALITY THAT THIS MOVIE WASRECEIVED !!!!!DISAPPOINTED BUYER"
1,Sounds and looks like a bootleg!,This movie is a beautiful classic but this DVD version is quite shoddy. It looks like somebody pointed a video camera at a theater screen and pressed record. The sound doesn't even seem to be synchronized with the picture!
1,Buyer Beware!,"This movie is transferred so badly, that it is definetly unwatchable...it is a big distorted pan and scan mess! While some reviewers find it ""watchable"" wait until you hear the sound! This movie is not worth the 4 bucks it sells used for...What a pity for such a great film. Shame on you, Madacy Entertainment!"
4,See what a lady a young Elizabeth Taylor was!,"I've always liked William Powell films...there always highly entertaining and contain nothing objectionable. Even his mermaid film was okay for children. This film is very clean. It's about upper-middle class family life in New York, 1883. Everything is top-notch. With suberb acting and a delightful musical score.See what a lady a young Elizabeth Taylor was!Only problem is, the video transfer and sound are aweful.**** 4 Stars! Highly recommended family viewing."
4,"Great Movie, poor soundtrack","This is a funny and entertaining movie, but (surprisingly for a DVD) the sound is distorted and takes some of the joy out of watching it."
1,William Powell: Life with Father,It is a great story but the DVD was terrible. The sound got worse and worse until we couldn't understand it. There were no subtitles so we couldn't even put those on to know what was going on. It was just a very bad copy.
1,Poor Quality,I've always loved the movie and couldn't wait to see the DVD. I was EXTREMELY disappointed. It looked like a poor vhs taping off of the TV. The sound was worse. That must account for the low price...
1,"Great movie, but unfortunately a terrible DVD","Because this is my mother's favorite movie, I grew up watching it countless times. I love this movie and can recite it line by line, which is good because a section of this DVD has no sound. I thought it was a defective DVD, but the second one sent to me had the same problem. The sound and picture quality in general is not good. It looks as if it was recorded from an old VHS. It's a great movie, but I suggest getting it on VHS or recording it next time it's on TV. You'll get much better quality, I'm sure."
2,"Great Story, Bad Video","Life with father brings back the traditional homefront from days gone by. In this movie, Clarence Day, played by William Powell, adds a stern, business-like, head of the house-hold type of character. Irene Dunne who plays his wife is a dutiful, constantly-pleasing yet constantly confusing her husband in day to day events. Delightful and up-lifting, viewers will enjoy the story. The video was not at all clear, rather, fuzzy and it was hard to hear as it tended toward a base-like quality. If anyone out there has a good quality VHS of this movie, I'd like to hear about it."
1,Speaking from a well,"I love this movie, but this DVD has horrible sound quality. The actors sound as though they were speaking from a well, and the louder anyone speaks, the worst the garbled effect. I ordered this to replace my VHS copy, but have since discarded the DVD. The VHS is a far superior product."
1,Where Is The Film Preservation Society When You Need Them?,"Everything good you've read about this wonderful film is true. Unfortunately, everything you've read about the Madacy transfer to DVD is also true... it is TERRIBLE. I indict you, Madacy! You shameful, profit-hungry swindlers! My family viewed only ten minutes and gave up on this blurry, incomprehensible waste of time and money. Afterwards we signed a pact NEVER to buy anything from Madacy again! Then we broke out an old VHS copy of ""The Man Who Came To Dinner"" and the night was saved."
1,DON'T BUY THIS DVD FROM MADACY - TERRIBLE TRANSFER,"Had I only known that this DVD - of a wonderful film - was released by MADACY ENTERTAINMENT, I never would have considered purchasing it. Madacy Entertainment is renowned for the terrible quality of its DVDs.This charming film was broadcast on Turner Classic Movies, recently, which reminded me what a delicious script, with razor-sharp performances, direction and technicolor, it is. What turned up in the mail, from Madacy, is a transfer taken from a television broadcast, not even a film print! Its audio and video are blurry and almost unintelligble.Wait for anyone else to release this beloved film on DVD - and stay away from Madacy Entertainment at any cost."
1,Very dissapointed!,"This is a terrible DVD. A lousy transfer, with lousy sound. It is on par with a disc you would buy in a 99 cent store. I should have returned it, but my husband said that by the time I paid for the shipping, it wouldn't have been worth the trouble. It's a shame really, because it's a sweet film, and deserves better."
1,Stay away from Madacy Entertainment,"Such a great movie, such a great way to watch a movie. What happened? Poor DVD digital quality (or lack of). The reason people have DVD players is to watch the best possible picture you can at home. I could have rented this movie on VHS and enjoyed it more if it was taped in SLP (or EP) mode. Buyer beware on this one."
3,Best available--but is DVD-R Media,"This is infinitely superior to the other versions available (they are unwatchable). However, I think this fell into public domain and Warner had no hand in restoring it. More is the pity.I subtract a star because this is not a pressed DVD.....this is a DVD-R with a thermal printed label.This was done in a cheap production facility. There are no chapter stops or other niceties...One could have done this on home equipment.At least the sound is decent (for once we can hear the rather inventively orchestrated Steiner score) and the picture settings are stable. The film color scheme was designed to be mostly pastels, thus it appears somewhat washed out (it almost looks colorized)."
2,Good enough for Laptops.,"The video transfer is poor, but I thought that the audio quality, which is very muddy, is what really mars this DVD. It appeared to be nearly unviewable on my big screen TV. However, it is tolerable on my laptop computer DVD, due to the small screen size, and using headphones to help the audio. All in all, good enough for $6.00 to $8.00."
1,Life With Father by UAV,Very poor reproduction...sound quality VERY POOR! Pick another brand other that the UAV Corp. version.
1,Life With Father - Digitally Remastered,"Yes, other DVD's of this title may be much worse, but this one is unwatchable--a major disappointment and a rip-off--with a pale, dull look to it. Also unlistenable. As another reviewer said, the voice pitch is noticeably higher, perhaps to shrink the running time so it would fit on a DVD-R. Also, the words sound clipped, in a botched attempt at noise reduction. The version shown on TCM has good sound and good enough color, so I should have stuck with that instead of wasting too much money on this so-called digitally remastered version. This film deserves better, but until it gets properly restored, turn on TCM and enjoy the show."
3,"The best version yet, but...","Some of the customer reviews of this DVD (the DigiCom TV ""Digitally Remastered"" version) are hyperbolic. This is no perfect transfer. The colors are pastel--not what one would expect from a three-strip Technicolor production of the 1940s, and not at all like the brilliant tones I have seen in showings of this movie on TCM. Skin looks a little odd; everyone has a pink face. However, this disk is by far the best DVD of ""Life with Father"" that has yet been offered. The picture is quite sharp and clean, and the sound is good. Unlike the many worthless public domain versions, this one is watchable and well worth the modest price, until a truly restored Warner Bros. version becomes available."
1,wonderful film and story - horrible video transfer,"This is a wonderful period piece of a Victorian family in New York. However, the transfer to DVD is a disaster. It is almost impossible to hear or understand the dialog as it sounds like it was done with a scratched record. It is so disturbing that my students stopped paying attention and asked me to shut it off, which I did. I haven't watched it since. It's too bad because it is a great film. If you can find the VHS version you will be thrilled."
1,BOO!,LIFE WITH FATHER is one of my favorite movies. This DVD version is very poor. I have just read the other costumer reviews about this movie. They agree with me. I will read the costumer reviews before I order another DVD.
2,"Good movie, weak video, poor sound","""Life With Father"" is an enjoyable movie. Unfortunately, the video on the DVD is not that good (though better than a VHS version I've seen). What makes this DVD a real disappointment is the sound quality. Aside from only coming through the left channel, the sound is rather muddled and fuzzy. I suppose one shouldn't complain too much given the low price, but it was still dissappointing."
1,Don't be tempted to buy this product.,"The DVD version is a disappointment indeed. The picture quality is very poor, the sound quality likewise so; approximately 58 minutes into the film the sound drops out completely, leaving about a 4 second gap in the dialogue. What reliable company could have offered this product for sale to the public, knowing that these flaws were obvious? Do not buy the DVD version at any price."
3,"Cute flic, fuzzy pic (and sound)","William Powell as an overbearing, perfectionist father, totally makes this movie happen. Interesting to see the demure side of Elizabeth Taylor. Not great drama, but a good 'dessert' movie. Too bad picture is so fuzzy, although I can live with that. The sound, however, was so distorted that it made it hard to interpret a lot of the dialog. There is about 5 seconds of sound missing on my copy. Don't know if that is an anomaly or if all DVDs have that. Still glad I bought it."
1,A horrible DVD transfer of a wonderful film!,"STOP!! Don't waste your money on this or anything by this company (MADACY ENTERTAINMENT). The picture's blurry and the sound is so muffled you can't hear most of it. No wonder it's so inexpensive- IT""S WORTHLESS! Weren't DVD's supposed to be a better quality than VHS?!"
1,Love the movie . . . Horrible transfer,"This is a warm, engaging film - a true delight to watch from start to finish IF you catch it on TV. This DVD transfer is terrible. The picture is bad and the sound is even worse."
1,Don't waste you money - a good movie trashed.,This edition is a tragedy. Video quality is mediocre at best with pixelation and blurry source material (looks like 16MM film) and the audio is muddy beyond all standards for modern day transfers.You will do better to record it on VHS tape off of AMC or Turner Classic Movies.No kidding.
2,Good movie made unwatchable by POOR DVD production,"Life w/ Father was an enjoyable film but the production of this DVD is beyond bad. The color was washed out, the sound muffled and in one portion of the film the sound completely dropped out for 10 seconds. It's unfortunate that these great old films are getting distributed in such poor quality. It may technically be in the DVD format, but there has been no effort taken to present a superior product."
5,Yum-o!,"I just got this pan and so far am very pleased with it! It was inexpensive, it heats well and evenly, plus I love the orange! The reasons I chose it are the price, the style, and most importantly in addition to those is that it is oven safe to 400 degrees. I believe that if you go any less expensive they are not oven safe. Great buy!!!"
1,Nonstick finish Peeling,"Bought this pan in August really loved it but suddenly the finish is peeling off - its totally ruined. I took good care of it, didn't use any metal on it and cleaned it with the proper pot cleaner as well. I'm hoping they will honor their warranty."
5,great,"pan - it cleans so well, lots of times these types of pans get marks that cannot be cleaned, not this one it is great."
3,Inexpensive or cheap?,"This pan will perform well for the money. However, it's appearance is cheap looking. The handle flexes when picking up empty. It feels very lightweight, and does not have much thickness in the bottom. It's a cheap pan at a cheap price, and no big bargain. It looks like something out of a ""Bigmart"" set."
5,A RARE FIND,I just read the The Folk Keeper for the second time. It's so rare to find a book one can thoroughly enjoy reading again and again. She reminds me of McKillip.
4,the folk keeper by: franny billingsley,"when you first start reading this book it is sort of confusing but once you get to the second or third chapter you start to understand what's happening and you get hooked!this is a great book to read if your interested in mystery/fantasy novelsthe setting takes place at the rhysbridge estateit's about a girl trying to find out who she really is and why certain things are happening to her: like why her hair grows 2"" a night and why is she attracted to the seawhen she finds out why she has to choose between the land and the water. which will she choose?you have to read the book to find out!!!i recommend this book to all who enjoy a great book!"
1,IT IS A RIP OFF,I NEVER RECEIVED IT AND THEY KEPT MY MONEY. NO BODY HAS DONE ANY THING FOR ME. I PLACED A COMPLAIN AND I HAVE NOT GOTTEN ANY RESPONCE
4,Easy Read,"This book was darned easy to follow. I liked the full code samples in the book, and they all worked!! I found JFC to be remarkably easy to understand with this book. So why not five stars? Well I have two complaints:Its too short, and too costly. I say revise it, add another 100 pages, and drop five or ten off the price,then I will call it a five star book!"
3,Not any different than regular Friskies,"I honestly cannot say that I saw any difference whatsoever in this variety compared to Friskies regular sliced beef version. Actually, my cat preferred the regular Friskies over this one. He's not really all that jazzed over these Fancy Feast varieties anyway, so if you're going to buy this one or the chicken, save your money and buy the regular Friskies versions. They seem to taste better to the cat and it saves you money. I've never had a cat that ever got too thrilled over this variety over the years so I guess I'll get the special ones instead."
4,Easy Listening,"Short Review:All-around easy listening. Nice arrangements, nothing complicated, and sticks to the original intent of the songs - nothing unrecognizable (the bain of so many instrumental albums). There's nothing amazing or musically profound, but if you're looking for some soft, adult-rock to chill by or entertain with, this is a great album. (Great date-nite music!!);-)"
4,Very good,"This a John Tesh Project disc, and even he would make the arranements, the main core of each melody is from the sax player who are several of them (some of them VERY recognized in the sax world as Everette Harp, Warren Hill, Etc.). That's why you will find several styles and kind of sax sounds, some of them with more passion and feeling, others more simple (without much feeling). All the arrangments are original (not a compilation with arrangments distributed in dozens of sax discs). In general terms it is a very good disc for sax and instrumental music lovers."
4,Don't laugh at the name !!!,When I first heard the name of this CD I laughed. Who wouldn't? But it's a great CD to pick up if you want background soothing music for any reason. Makes for a great conversation piece when you tell people what the CD is named. I really enjoy the sax and the songs are all well known which is a plus.
1,Ok CD for Sax lovers.,"The only song of this CD worth sampling is the ""Broken Wings"" track. Save your money! The SAX ON THE BEACH CD is better in my opinion."
2,bare-bones version by HardPress publishing,"I am reviewing the paperback version published by HardPress (green and gray cover). This version has no figures, and the non-English passages are not translated anywhere. This is absolutely the most bare-bones possible.The content itself by Darwin is, as usual, amazing. But do not buy this version."
3,Not the favorite in our house,"Once or twice a year for a little variety and that's about enough for my cat of this particular variety. He likes it for a change from his chicken, turkey and beef, but not very often. He will eat about 3/4 of the can and then he's had enough. He's not a huge fish fan anyway, but this stuff looks to be about the best out there in the fish varieties. The chunks are bit sized so if your cat has a small mouth like mine does, it will be easier to chew. Don't know why my cat doesn't like this type of fish, but he really could care less about it."
2,Tetherball Set,My biggest problem with this set was the ball. It was too light. The material the ball was made from was not at all like the tether balls at the schools. I bought it for my children for Christmas and they have played with it only once.
3,not perfect,"pretty good for the price. However, the ball is harder than I expected and the pole slides around in the shelve that the pole is put in, so it is not very stable. You really want a soft ball so that children don't hurt their hands."
5,Must have! Great desk reference!,It is invaluable when writing articles and helping customers.Keep up the good work !!When is the next edition coming out?
2,Clean up is a problem,I have had this product for 10 months and it made good desserts and was able to make a nice froth for coffee. The downside is that the milk or sauce sticks to the bottom and it is hard to clean even when it is soaked. If you have a large group of people it can only froth milk enough for about 5 people. Once it is done you have to wash the container to cool it down otherwise the machine will not start. You also have to be very careful not to get the underside of the container wet. If you do you must immediately dry it. I used it for a few months and now it sits on my counter somewhat forlorn. If I was able to I would rate it 4 stars for ease of use and quality of desserts but 1 star for keeping it clean.
1,A Spoiler,"Maybe the frother works as a sauce maker.But that's not why I bought it. However, the froth I looked forward to adding to my espresso is not possible. The milk remains liquidy and continues to pour as milk rather than as froth to be spooned on top of the coffee. This machine clearly rates as a ""non-buy""."
3,it's okay,but i never used this book. It sits on the shelf though and asa study of the Roots of western speech i suppose it is ok. It is compact.
1,Awful. This book will help anyone fall right to sleep.,"This book was painfully slow. The twists and turns of the plot could have been compelling if the author kept the story interesting. Instead, it was pitiful."
1,Don't you just want to tell these folks to GET A GRIP!,"OK, OK, I am only abut 400 pages into this (overly) publicized book. From the reviews I've read here, it was a ""must read""...I just want to say to these people: get a grip...communicate; talk it out! I am hoping that when I write again with my final thoughts upon completion, I/we will all feel better!"
2,oy,"885 pages of Murphy's Law death, tragedy, and angst. Throw in a silly wabbit (two, actually). 15 final pages of th-th-that's all folks--and you have this tedious mess."
1,I don't know what the fuss is about!,"I've seen a lot of great reviews for I Know This Much Is True but I don't agree with most people. I loved Wally's first book, She's Come Undone but I can't say the same for this. It seemed to go on forever saying nothing in particular. It may have had the same style as She's Come Undone but I didn't like it. I thought there was no point to it & that all those like 800 pages were full of babble. I gave it 2 stars because it wasn't horrible, just boring. If you want something that will motivate you to read....God, don't choose I Know This Much Is True."
4,It's going to be made into a movie,"The last time I'd cried over a father and son story was after reading 'Death of a Salesman'. This time I cried again. The story is full of emotion. It is also very dramatic. Too dramatic in some parts: brother is suspected of getting HIV, girlfriend dies from HIV and then the other brother has to be tested for HIV. But although the story ends with a Hollywood ending, I liked the story because it's a story about forgiveness and forgiving the sins others have committed against you. It's also about being humble and admitting your own sins."
5,this was the best book i've ever read,This was the best book i've ever read. I was glued to it and the author really captivates you with not just the story of Dominic & his brother but with lots of stories that are intricately interwoven to create this masterpiece of a novel. This is an extremely long book - the longest book i've ever read - I finished it quickly and I would read it again and again. It was absolutely fantastic - JUST READ IT - you'll see.
2,She's come undone was much better.,It is slow to get into. Feel She's come undone was much more interesting. Almost gave up on it 2 or 3 times but did manage to finish it
5,Should Go Down in History as a Classic,"An astounding work! This one rates with Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment. Fascinating characters, great story, interesting twists, authentic dialoge that rings true. At times, you may believe you're reading an autobiography.Also well researched. It is apparent that Wally Lamb did his homework on paranoid schizophrenics, the relationships of twins, and more. Hope to read it again.There's a valid reason why over 1000 people have rated it at 4 1/2 stars. Take the plunge! Read the book!!!!"
1,interminable,"To start with the ending: What a fortuitous turn of coincidental fate! Coincidence in real life happens all the time. In fiction it is totally unbelievable. The rest of the book I found to be extremely uneven, repetitious, and sometimes obscured by its own convoluted language. The bouncing from past to present was occasionally confusing, The ""Domenico"" papers were written very unevenly until I was saying to myself, is this the old man or the grandson talking here? I was not sorry I read the book, but it took me a long time, a chapter a day as it were, and ALWAYS I was wondering... (I am a writer) How did he ever get a publisher to read his original manuscript?"
1,Dysfunction Central,"I didn't think this book was worth the trip to library and hours I spent reading it. First, it was similar to Lamb's first novel ""She's Come Undone"" in that it throws in every possible form of dysfunction into one small family. What bothered me even more were the stereotypes of every race/group (Italians, Jews, Feminists, American Indians to name a few). I would not recommend this one."
5,Wow!,"This has to be one of the best fiction stories I have read, and so was She Comes Undone which I read about six months earlier. I had just finished reading this book this afternoon. While reading, I found myself flipping page after page. Non-stop. The flash back of memories and strong imageries that Wally Lamb writes was the reason why I read on. It was just like stories within another story which covered three generations of history. The ending was nothing like what I expected. This was a hefty book, took me a week and worth while. This has to be one of the best fiction stories I have read, and so was She Comes Undone which I read about six months earlier.Just the first chapter alone will get you hooked."
5,patience is a virtue,"This review is really for those of you that are feeling the dread of another 400 pages of drawn out storytelling. Lamb makes up for it in the end.I absolutely LOVED ""She's Come Undone"" and figured this would be as good. I was right! BUT the 1st 75% of the book really dragged for me and I was ready to put it down - for the 2nd time.....but I persisted and WOW- I was completely in awe by the end of the book, I wanted more! It's like one of those movies (or books) you can't stop thinking about and wanting to rewatch (or reread). I'm REALLY glad I was determined to finish it this time - persistance pays off!"
2,Felt more like an assigned read ....,"Shame on Wally Lamb for enticing his readers with a somewhat enjoyable first half....only letting them down with a droll, lackluster second half. The only reason I finished the book was due to my desire to ""finish what I've started"". After tossing the book to the wayside after attempting to comprehend what I had just wasted two weeks reading, I could only surmise that Wally Lamb didn't want to continue with the book either...that's why he took the easy way out with the second half, allowing his characters to become inconsistent and shapeless and the plot to take a serious nosedive. ONE BIG LETDOWN!"
3,Couldn't put it down & then was disappointed at the ending.,"I was eagerly awaiting my Amazon delivery of this book. Got it Monday afternoon, started reading Monday evening, made the remainder of the weeks plans around my read. It was compelling. I was giving daily updates to my co-workers. I couldn't wait to pass it on. AND, then the end! I felt like Lamb got tired and just opted out. The tension he had created was so exciting and then it ends up like a Danielle Steel mini-series - they all live happily, prosperously, everafter. Quite disappointing after all of the complex character and plot developments."
4,"900 pages read like 300, I LOVED IT.",I enjoyed this book from beginning to end. I could not put it down. I loved She's Come Undone and when I Know This Much Is True came out I was intimidated by the # of pages and did not want to read it. A lady at my book club said it didnt read like 900 pages and she was right. I am going to recomend this book to everyone this summer and I look forward to Mr. Lamb's next novel.
4,This book was wonderful!,"I enjoyed this book very much. It has many pages, but keeps you interested until the end. There was one part of the book (when the main character starts reading his grandfather's ""story"")that I was starting to lose interest. But then, I became interested in what he was reading about his grandfather. It opened up my eyes to several things-such as what it would be like to be a twin of a schizophrenic. I think what I enjoyed most about this book was the fact that the main character encountered every thing that could possibly go wrong in one's life-and he overcame them all! At one point I was thinking ""wow-this guy has so many problems-I am surprised that he was not more depressed, suicidal, etc."""
5,I Loved It!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book from start to finish, really, I couldn't put it down. Mr. Lamb envokes compassion in even the most unlikeable of characters. He leads the reader on a fascinating journey of analysis, growth, and ultimately, peace.This is a truly rewarding read."
4,Amazing Book,"When I first picked up the book, the weight of the pages was very intimidating. I never thought I would be able to read a 900 page book. I ended up reading it in two weeks - I couldn't put it down. I must admit that the ending was probably the weakest part of the story, but the rest of the book was very powerful. All in all, I would highly recommended it to all."
4,Very well written,"I could not put this book down! It held my interest all the way through. The ending, however, came together a bit too perfectly. The book is definitely worth a read, though."
5,"EVEN BETTER THAN ""SHE'S COME UNDONE""!","Wonderful story. Great character development. I could not put this book down. Read all 800+ pages in two sitting. Please write more, Mr. Lamb! Can't wait to read the next one."
3,A very insightful story of family discovery,Although I enjoyed his first novel more than this one I sitll think it was a well written story and the content was very interesting. I found it a little slow going at first but I am sure glad I didn't give up on it. I is a wonderful story of family ties and self discovery. I believe that the history from the gradfathers perspecitve was a necessary and integral part of the book. The similarities in his story to that of his daughters and grandsons are important in Dominicks search of himself. After all history repeats itself. I admired Dominicks vigor in helping his brother although I beleive his reasons were not even clear to himself mainly his need to do good for his dead mother.
4,A pick-it-up-when-you-can book!,"I loved ""She's Come Undone""... it made me want more. Now I get it with this great story of Dominick and Thomas (and their grandfather!) I kept this book with me everywhere I went these past 2 weeks so I could read every chance I got. Now, all I want to know is when is Mr. Lamb's next book coming, cause I'm ready for even more!!!"
5,Wally Lamb - true to himself,"After having read ""She's come undone"" twice when it first came out, I was extremely anxious for another book by this amazing author. One Friday night, my weekly jaunt to the bookstore, made me so very happy - There was his new book and a whole 900 pages! I was not disappointed and savored every line. Powerful, more than just a novel - Plan on reading this one again too. Very poignant, quirky, loved all the characters. Surprising turns. Just wonderful! Thank-you, Mr. Lamb."
5,Absolutely wonderful!,"Can't say enough or more than what's already been said here. The story is wonderfully told. The book is big, the story long, you meet many characters, BUT you invest in them. You like them, you even feel close to them, flaws and all. I highly recommend this book. Hint: there's even a story within the story and I couldn't tell where I liked being more! It was THAT good!"
5,don't silence this lamb!,"after finishing both,""I know this much is true"",and ""shes come undone"", i have found a new favorite author. lamb has spun a yarn that carries one from laughter to tears,from contemporary america to old country europe. the characters are believable,and the premise as real as the five o'clock news. the book gets a little heavy only when the voice of papa dominates the story for too long. fortunately for us, lamb does'nt spend too much time on any one subject, he has too much to say.i think this book can be enjoyed by anyone,especially if you find yourself on your own journey to self-discovery."
3,Kinda Sorta,"I kinda liked I KNOW THIS MUCH IS TRUE and I sorta didn't! =) There were times in this book where the rambling just went on and on. I could have cut out about a third of this book and it still would have maintained it's good meaty parts that steal a readers heart. I loved She's Come Undone and while I did LIKE this book, I would never recommend it highly on my things to read list. I would say read it purely for the sake of reading it because there are some twists and unsuspecting turns that are worth talking about but I was sometimes thumbing through parts that were unnecessary."
4,"Outstanding, I couldn't put it down.","I thought the story was very well developed. The lenght of the book only allows the reader to become intimately involved with the characters. The only part that I felt got in the way of the overall story at times, was the grandfather's story, it could have been a bit shorter."
4,"A VERY COMPELLING,INTENSE READ","WOW,,What a life,Wally Lamb captured one familys' tortured,complex life with such honesty and gave it so much gripping humanity,,,it made me grateful for my comparatively boring family life. I was so entrenched with this novel..that I could'nt sleep for 3 nights,and 3 days...untill I finished it. Alas the ending was just too neat and packaged too perfectly.But will be remembered on my list as one of my all time favorites."
5,FANTASTIC!!,"I'm a 15-year-old girl. I read the book when I was 14- and although it's almost 900 pages, I read it in 9 days. Every time I reread the last part, I cry. BEST BOOK I'VE EVER READ!! Email me to discuss it."
2,"Dissapointed, it was too slow and the point was...","I was very disappointed after reading for hours and hours about all the tragedies the character is faced with. By the end I was tired and depressed from all the predictaments the poor man was in. I kept waiting for a climax or a revelation that would make my heat leap and it never happened. The hand removal and the monkey scene were shocking to an extent. Although, I didn't feel the author really went anywhere with all of the shocking events. Due to the topics Oprah was covering on her program I was really hoping for a more positive story or a least a more meaningful one. I was expecting a really great book because it was recommended on Oprah's book club but I came away leary of her recommendations."
5,What a great read,"I was in two minds (no pun intended!) whether or not to read this book, but I am so glad that I did.It was so good to read and so hard to put down.I'm sure I'll read it again, once I get it back from my friends."
4,A captivating page-turner,"It is rare to read a book and after you've finished the last page, want to start at the beginning and read it again, that's how enthralling it was. I myself am an identical twin, and Lamb did some serious homework to capture the ""twin-ness"" that he cannot know firsthand. Sure this particular family had as much dysfunction to deal with that is bordered on the unbelieveable, but the story kept moving. I would compare it to Victor Hugo's literature: how all the disparate threads were neatly woven together at the end, very satisfying. Sure, the narrating twin is the strongest character; Unlike Dostoevskis Brothers Karamozov where each brother represented something higher, other stronger characters voices would have diluted and perhaps even confused the tale."
3,Only after 850 pages---a chick flick screenplay!,"I cried, ""FOUL!"" after slugging through 850 pages (and not finding one developed male character)to reach an extremely dissatisfying ending. Note to Lamb: hire someone else to re-do the last ten pages. Aw man, I was snookered."
5,Love the book!!!,I specifically waited till the weather turned colder to start reading I KNOW THIS MUCH IS TRUE. And I loved every word of it. Mr. Lamb is a great writer. Can't wait for his next book!!!
4,"Remarkable, reminds you that forgiving is not that simple.","Wally Lamb was brilliant; although it was a lengthy book I could not stop reading it. It was a book that emphasized in how important your first years of life shape up the rest of it. I really didn't care much about a lot of the extra people that were mentioned in his granfathers biography, especially the monkey and her witchcraft. In overall I understand that by Dominick reading that biography he learned to find himself. I also wished that the biography wouldn't jump from chapter to chapter. It would make me get into the biography and then it would stop and another chapter would be about what was going on in the present; get used to that and then have to read more about the biography. The near end of the book was so addicting that I kept reading it until I finished it at three thirty in the morning. Great book I highly recommend it!!"
2,Predictable,"Bouncing back and forth from past to present makes for some pretty fast reading. Is this the same book as She's Come Undone, just different characters? Hey, Wally, it would be interesting if you stretched yourself and tried a different approach for your third book. I've found both of Lamb's novels to be highly predictable -- in fact, I was on an island in the South Pacific reading She's Come Undone, and found 3 critical chapters in my book completely blank. Never fear, I made up my own conclusions and never missed a beat. She's Come Undone is way more fun than these two cry-baby's story. Besides, I won't hurt my back picking up She's Come Undone. There should be rules about how long and drawn out a book should be. Was the Editor in the South Pacific without a red marker? Also to the Editor, typos are not acceptable."
3,Bit long winded & predictable American ending,The book could have been condensed into 500pages. The only reprive in the second half of the book was his grandfathers diary. One felt that the ending was very cliched with the hero getting the girl back.
4,"Long, but worth the read","When I finally was the lucky recipient of getting this book after four months of reserve at my library, I started the book with a feeling of trepidation that this seemingly interminable book would be 898 pages of dullness. Instead, I was totally engrossed of the story of Dominick Birdsey, a 40 year-old housepainter. Except for the revealing excerpts of his grandfather's autobiography, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and most definitely recommend it."
5,Absolutely AWESOME!!,"Wow! What a crazy ride. I started this book Friday night, finished (in tears) on Tuesday afternoon. I'm not sure I've ever felt so connected to the characters in a book before--total empathy, and hopefully some insights into my own past. Don't be intimated by the length--I would have read on for another 900 pages! Can't wait to see what Mr. Lamb produces next."
5,I am addicted to this novel!,"After reading Wally Lamb's first novel, She's Come Undone my thoughts were consumed by it. I told everyone I knew to read the book. I was so addicted to it that I would literally walk down the hallways reading it. Well, the addiction has happened again. I started I Know This Much is True, a 900 pg. book on a Tuesday and could not rest until I could finish it. It made me laugh out loud, cry, cheer, thank the Lord for my life, and in the end cry again because I had to say goodbye to the characters that I felt I had such a bond with. This book has truly done something to me and I have taken some of the many life lessons the book has taught me and tried to apply them in my own life. I recommend this to everyone. It is honestly one of the best books I have ever read."
3,"Great read, but hold the therapy, please!","This book is an admirable follow-up to the splendid She's Come Undone. Wally can definitely spin a good yarn, we know this much is true. The characters are vivid and likeable. The range of emotions is vast, and Wally shows a deeper understanding of the complexity of human nature than most novelists. But the countless therapy sessions are too much for a reader to bear. Introspection, yes. Overblown psychotherapy, no. The conclusion, however, is sweetly satisfying. Stick with it."
5,Excellent Summer Reading!,Great book. Gives you great insight to your own thoughts about your family of origin. Couldn't put it down!
3,Very long,"I am reading this book and find it has too much detail, I am wondering where this is going, what is the actual story about?"
4,Never read a book this fast..,"I thought this book would be dreadful considering it was 900 pages, but I loved it. I never read a book as fast as I read this one. It was taken in a first person's account, and it drew you into the lives of Dominick, Thomas, and their family and friends. This book kept me up for many nights. A great read!! Oprah was right!!! I can't say more without giving away some good stuff.. But, you'll enjoy it.."
4,A treatise on self-discovery.,The first 800 pages are really tough going. Then it lets go of your windpipe just enough for you to take a breath. The struggle is worth the effort--the structure of the novel is probably a metaphor for the story.
5,Fabulous -- Begs for discussion in a lit class or book club,"Twins, monkeys, (twin monkeys?). I loved this book. The 900 pages went by like nothing, and as Oprah said on her show, ""It just keeps going."" Trite ending? Maybe, but I think it was the right ending. Kudos to Oprah for finally choosing a book about something other than a weak woman who makes bad choices and whines about them for pages and pages. I live reasonably close to the College where Lamb teaches -- boy would Ilove to take one of his classes, but I bet by now they're impossible to get into. Buy it, read it, love it, pass it on!"
5,It will stay with you,"I almost didn't finish this book. I hated Dominick, the main character. He was self-centered, cruel, angry...I really could not understand how he had any friends, much less a live-in girlfriend and an ex-wife who still cared about him. It seemed that any woman with a shred of common sense would stay as far away from him as possible.But the book is about more than Dominick. It is about the importance of family and the role that each member plays. It is about Dominick's struggle for redemption, and in reading about his struggle one realizes that his friends, family members, and the women in his life are all flawed and struggling too. The characters are so real and well defined, the scenes are so well written, that I could see the sterile walls of the institution where his brother was taken. I could see Dr. Patel in her sari as she tried to help Dominick come to terms with the person that he was and the person that he could be.It is a good story. One that should not be missed."
5,This Looooong book is worth every minute it takes to read it,"This is another deep and emotion-provoking novel by bestselling author Wally Lamb, author of She's Come Undone, another one of my favorites. This book is worthy to be called a ""saga"" because it explores so many aspects of life and has different stories which cross time periods, generations, and cultures. People Magazine called it ""a gratifying saga of loss and redemption"", and I definitely agree. This is only a small part of the story, and a small example of Wally's great writing. If you know how complicated life can get, if you ever feel like re-examining your own life, or if you just love a good story that keeps getting more intriguing just when you think it can't possibly be more so, then you will love I Know This Much Is True."
5,An inspiring novel of a man's journey to self-understanding,"In this novel Wally Lamb had shown us the capacity we have to both understand and change ourselves. It is the struggle of one man to learn and accept who he is and where he came from, and to come to terms with the fact that he somehow escaped the mental illness that has consumed his twin brother. One of the best books I've ever read, and everyone I've talked to agrees."
3,a mixed bag with a compelling storyline,"As a clinician who works with schizophrenics, is fluent in Italian, and was a huge fan of _She's Come Undone_, I wanted to enjoy Lamb's book much more than I did.Although he paints a believable picture of both the twins and the schizophrenia, he veers far from course when writing the translation of his grandfather's diaries. The translation does not read ""true"" from a translators point and distracts from the base story rather than adds to it. The entire middle of the book appears unnecessary.When exploring the psyches of the twins and their intricately linked lives, the book shines. I think it meanders too much through the middle and loses some of its raw power by taking the long way around the story."
5,Domenico grows up while telling his life story...,"Loved this book. Wally Lamb is an incredible story teller. I am typically not interested in fiction (at all!), but mr Lamb has possibly changed this for me. Possibly. There was a point in the book where I slammed the book on my lap and screamed aloud. If I had witnessed this behavior from another human being, I would have thought many unfavorable things about them. I have a dry, no drama personality (typically) and this book had me sucked into this (fictitious...gasp!) man's life and emotionally reacting to every page!"
5,love love love,This is a great book....just finished it..and was sad for it to end....its long but worth it..... Does not disappoint.
1,"I thought this was a biography of the band, Spandau Ballet..","...just kidding. Actually, I thought that this book is incredibly slow moving. The characters are not likable. What's even worse is that they're not even hatable. I felt like the book was like a dimly lit black and white movie. I'm 75% complete with this book and I just don't have it in me to finish it. Life's too short for depressing and uninteresting characters that don't help a plot to develop."
2,I Know This Much is True,"I read Wally Lamb's first book ""She's Come Undone"" and thoroughly enjoyed it - couldn't put it down.However, ""I Know This Much is True"" is a disappointment in comparison. I can easily put it down and walk away for a few days and not want to know what happens yet. The story is slow with too many flashbacks, confusing and generally, it doesn't feel like it's worth getting into."
1,Don't waste your time with this one.,"I have to say that this is one of the worst books I have ever read. The characters are stereotyped and insipid, the prose mediocre at best. This is pop literature. In reading it, I was reminded of a Lifetime television film.The world is full of amazing literature. There's little sense, therefore, in wasting one's praise on this more lacking piece."
1,I gave the book away,"I did not finish the book, but gave it to my County Library. I could not wade through the large amounts of inappropriate language and activities. Definately an 'R' rated book and one I cannot recommend to my friends for this reason."
1,miserable,"I would bet my last dollar that Wally Lamb is an absolutely miserable, depressed person. I'm quite sure that all the money he made from this piece of garbage hasn't even got him out of the dark place he is in. I feel sorry for his three sons growing up around the kind of man who would spend his days trying to pass off cartoonish obcenity as literary genius."
1,This book is awful,"If you enjoyed ""She Comes Undone"", you will not like this book. Reading this book was an arduous experience. Do not waste your money or time on this book."
5,Wow...,"I'm exhausted! I feel that I have lived the characters' lives with them. I have just finished this extraordinary novel, and I am in awe of Wally Lamb. He is a truely talented and imaginative man. I have never read a novel that could keep so many lives, stories, and happenings, so connected AND interesting until the last paragraph on the last page. I was sceptical at first and thought I would never get through the book, but before I knew it, I was on the home straight and wanting more.Please do yourselves a favor...grab a G&T, sit back and enjoy the book. You may then realise, as I have, how wonderfully uncomplicated your own life really is!! I'll definitely read more of his writing in the near future. Now back to my abandoned housework!!"
5,THEE most profound stories I have ever read.,"I didn't know how he could top She's Come Undone but he did with I Know This Much is True. I didn't want the book to end. I cannot express how moved I am. Congratulations, Mr. Lamb, and I send you my heartfelt thanks for your creation! I have not enjoyed a book so much since Prince of Tides. Write another one real soon! I await your next work with great anticipation."
4,Well developed plot and subplots,"I really liked this book. It was great reading and the characters pocesses quite alot of depth. The only complaint I have is that it seemed to me that that loose ends were tied up too neatly and quickly with less thought given to it than to the original story line. For example, the translation of PaPa's story just fell into Dominick's lap so conveniently and Thomas's death was so simple and quick........Dominicks life turned out predictably wonderful .....marrying his true love and combining the good of both himself and Thomas in his personality. All said, I would recommend this book and truely enjoyed it, in spite of the few aforementioned exceptions."
5,I couldn't put this book down!,"I had read Wally Lamb's first book, ""She's Come Undone"". It was so bizarre that I couldn't put it down. But this book was so much better!! It was twisted and bizarre too, but I kept yearning to read more... to find out the truth. It also made me realize that no matter what has happened in my life, there are those who have had it worse. I absolutely loved the ending. Most books I read, I hate the endings, they leave you hanging and wanting to know more. With too many loose ends hanging. I felt so good when I finished this book. A must-read that I will recommend to many!!"
3,"Good, but not great","I enjoyed reading this book; however, the ""book within the book"" was unnecessary and, well, frankly boring. I would have skipped over this bit but Mr. Lamb puts it in the final half of the book so I felt obligated to read it since I had already invested so much time in the story. Also the ending is too pat... The ends of the story are tidied up too nicely. I didn't buy it."
5,"I CAN ONLY SAY, LISTEN TO ME AND READ IT, IT'S WONDERFUL!","I JUST FINISHED IT. I AM SAD I AM THROUGH WITH IT AS I FELT LIKE I KNOW ALL THE PEOPLE AND HAD TO SAY GOOD-BYE. IT WAS A GREAT BOOK AND A WONDERFUL EXPERIANCE. I TRULY FELT SAD BUT HAPPY FOR DOMINICK. AND YES, I DID CRY AT THE END AS IF IT WERE A MOVIE AND I WAS IN IT! BEST BOOK YET!"
2,"I agreed with every other 1, 2 and 3 star rating listed!","The novel was long-winded, foul-mouthed and downright depressing. While it obviously had appeal to those who gave it 4 or 5 star reviews, I found no beauty or depth in the characters, plot or writing style. Mr. Lamb obviously sought to shock his readers throughout the novel, but with street-language and sexual references that would only entertain an adolescent with raging hormones."
2,Not one of my favorites...,I simply found it boring and had to stop about half way through. It's just not my kind of book.
2,Sad life story,"Well written but incredibly depressing. Dragged out a bit. It's just one crappy thing after the other for the main character, and its exhausting."
5,An Instant Contemporary Classic,"Mark my words--this novel WILL be taught in universities someday. It's brilliant prose, and yet, unlike many contemporary novels, the writing does NOT contest with the plot and character. I wanted more. 900 pages was not enough.I look forward to reading more of Mr. Lamb's writing. It's not often that I find a novel I shove into the hands of friends and family. This is one of them."
3,Good for the first 500 pages,"I had no trouble getting into the book, and flew through the first 500 pages, then I hit the tedious last 400 like a brick wall. Dominick's many meetings with Dr Patel dragged on too long, it seemed they just kept reiterating the same thing throughout each session. Then the whole Papa's biography bit, what can I say, each time a new section of his history started I had to flip through the pages to see how much reading I had to go through to get back to the good stuff, not to mention it was totally unrealistic. There is no way someone recollecting memoirs would go into such detail in descibing Prosperines childhood adventures. Overall, it was a good book, and could have been a great book had it been edited down 3-400 pages. She's Come Undone was much better."
5,A Break Through!,"Although I love to read, I have been having trouble lately getting into a book. I would read the first chapter and get bored. This book has been the key! Finally! I felt I really got to know the characters and even found myself dreaming about them when I slept! I wish it didn't have to end."
5,Please Read the Book!,This book is truly amazing! Wally Lamb has sewn a blanket of life in I Know This Much Is True. Each piece of the blanket is joined together by life's trials and tribulations so that by the end of the book I was afforded an opportunity to wrap myself up and feel secure despite many of my own fears. Thanks Wally!
3,Realistic fiction - until the ending!,"The best part about this book are the complex characters. Iwould find myself disgusted with Dominick - his arrogance, his filthymouth, and his weakness. But then his goodness would shine through and I would have to re-evaluate my feelings towards him. While the plot kept the novel going, the characters were the reason for reading it.However, when I finished the book I could envision Mr. Lamb saying to himself, ""Oh my goodness - I am on page 870 and haven't gotten close to the ending yet! I had better hurry this thing up!"" Because that was what I felt happened to the ending. It wasn't closure - it was tidying up the characters and their messy lives. Way too happy-endingish for the complexity of these people, especially Dominick. The pages wasted on his grandfather's memoirs (the highlights would have sufficed) could have been used to develop a more realistic reuniting with Dessa and his psychological rehabilitation."
5,Outstanding and a Touch of Magical Realism to Boot!,"I thoroughly enjoyed the book and would highly recommend it! I completely agree with all of the other comments concerning the depth and richness of the characters and themes. While reading, I was also reminded of another one of my favorite authors, Gabriel Garcia Marquez (in fact, Marquez is mentioned in the book as one of the authors that Dominick reads). As I read the ""story within a story"" as told by Dominick's deceased grandfather, I couldn't help but be reminded of some of the incredible characters and events of a Marquez novel. This was truly a fascinating, touching and well-written book!"
1,So depressing,"This book was compelling, but SO depressing. The premise was interesting, and I liked the characters, but the sheer amount of tragedy was just too much. I skimmed the last half, hoping for something good to happen.. and after 900 pages of pain and anguish, it all turns out rosy in the last chapter?! Ugh.."
4,Pretty Good,"This book was pretty good. I enjoyed the fact that we got to delve into Dominick Birdsey's trials and tribulations both as a child and as an adult. The only problem is that there were just way too many bad things happening to him and thus, made it unbelievable. I know that sometimes these things happen (and believe me, I've had my fair share) BUT there were just too many. From abusive father, to schizophrenic twin, to wacko girlfriend, to suicide, it just got to be a bit much. The length was a bit much too. But I must say that Wally Lamb is an awesome writer and totally brings you into the character. TO make a character that in one way or another, everyone can relate to, makes it an easy read. Keep peeling out the books, Mr. Lamb!!"
3,"I wanted to like this book, but in the end I didn't care","After reading the countless customer reviews raving about this book, I really ""wanted"" to like this book. A friend of mine advised me to just get past the first bloody part and then I would be hooked. Sadly, I never got hooked. I did plod through 200 pages and decided if I still wasn't hooked, it was time to move on to something else. I felt the story was too bleak and depressing to continue on for hundreds and hundreds of pages. I read Angela's Ashes which was also bleak and depressing, but for some reason I really cared about the characters. I never really cared about the characters in this book."
1,"String of abusive and self-destructive events followed by a quick ""happy ever after""","I read this book for a book group discussion otherwise I would not have gotten past the first 200 pages. It consists of a parade of relentlessly mean-spirited and depressing events strung together for a glacial 900 pages. The protagonist is a self-absorbed and immature jerk who, in the last few pages, wises up, gains some social skills, reunites with his ex-wife, and becomes a millionaire. I don't think so."
5,I KNOW THIS MUCH IS TRUE,"great book. easy to read. i couldn't put it down. time passed very quickly while reading this one. it was surprising, riviting and believeable. a must read!"
5,This book was hard to put down,"When I tried to find a stopping place to take a break from I Know This Much Is True, Lamb kept giving teasers to keep me reading. It was easy to relate and empathize with Dominick as he went through sessions with the therapist. I knew things were going to really get suspenseful and complicated when the therapist told him there were two lost brothers, not just Thomas. Anyone interested in the workings of the human mind would find the book fascinating. Reading the book was like a good friend telling me the story. Lamb has a true talent of writing conversation. After I completed I Know This Much Is True, I immediately downloaded Lamb's first novel."
5,I know this much is true.,"This was the best book I have read. I just finished it (as slowly as I could possibly could), and I can't stop thinking about Dominick and his family. What a strange way to wrap up the story......anyway, can anyone recommend any online discussion groups I can check out?"
4,"Hard reading, worth the time","It took me several months to get through this book. The story sometimes drags, especially when he tells stories about working for the city. But each time I picked it up, I easily slid back into the world Wally Lamb created. I've read a lot of books, and this one amazed me because as soon as I thought I knew where the story was going, I found a new curve in the road. I loved the ending and how it brought everything full circle. No matter if you are a twin or have someone in your family with a mental disorder, you need to read this book. Lamb has something in this story that you will relate to and be moved by."
3,"Hits everything, Touches nothing.","Child porn. Bestiality. Child abuse. Adultery. AIDS. Mental illness. Illegitimacy. Infertility. SIDS. Homosexuality. Racism. Incest. Poverty. Classism. Spousal Abuse. Monkey Abuse. Sodomy. Prisoner Rape. Blackmail. Political corruption. Witchcraft. Holy crap, Wally Lamb, you managed to touch just about every controversial subject known to woman without making me care about any of it, accept the monkey whore. I loved the monkey whore.Yeah, read the book, but go ahead and skip all the BS about Leo and how he meets Dessa. Skip the old Papa's 'manuscript, too, if your pressed for time. It reveals nothing. It's pretty much filler. Also, I would have preferred the book be written from Thomas' point of view. Lastly, the only bit of this book that was off...Thomas acts like he's not even being treated for schizophrenia all the way through the book, yet supposedly he's on all kinds of meds to control it, it's not realistic at all. I should know, as crazy s I am."
1,I know this much is tr,"The book was captivating . I was given this book in hard copy. I had to travel and did not want to carry such a large/heavy book along with a backpack and luggage. I downloaded it from Amazon, I could not stop reading, ""I know this much is true""."
5,"Excellent - a ""page-turner""","Definitely a book that is a wonderful addition to your reading collection.The writing is intense and memorable.As with all of Lamb's writing the characters are well developed and it is impossible to not feel after reading that you have ""known"" the main characters of the book.Only negative comment is that it seemed as if a lot of time and events transpired in the last chapter(s) of the book. Felt a bit rushed and not as developed as the rest of the writing."
5,"Even Better Than ""She's Come Undone""","Wally Lamb takes on many different topics in ""I Know This Much Is True"", and towards the end, juggles many different storylines, but he does it without dropping any of it or letting anything sag, which is a danger in a novel of this size. I thoroughly recommend this book!"
4,"Characters Unforgettable...Story Line, a Bit Hazy","In this book as well as She's Come Undone, Wally Lamb introduces these characters that become so engrained in your mind that you feel as if they are your long-lost friends from high school. You cannot forget the trials and triumphs that they encounter. The real drawback that I found in this book was the ever-compiling plot, at times I felt like it would never end. This not only becomes monotonous, the reader cannot physically remember important ideas from the beginning of the book. Coming from an English background it is hard to find literary theories and themes however Lamb may not have been targeting that kind of audience.Overall the book was interesting if taken in small doses but there was nothing in the book that moved me."
4,Wow!,"I read Mr. Lamb's ""She's Come Undone"" and didn't really expect what I read here.I will have to tell you that sometimes, the story gets too wordy, but once you get started, it becomes hard not to get wrapped up in the Twin's life.Takes a while to read, but if you make it through, I think you'll like it."
1,How dysfunctional can a family get?,I don't enjoy reading about all the tragedies that can happen to one family! The first 880 pages delineate each one in painful detail. Then all is wrapped up in the last 20 pages and everything works out peach keen for the main character. I wish I would have spent my time reading 2 or 3 good books!
2,XXXX,What a shame such a heartwarming story had to be ruined with excessive vulgarity. If I had wanted to read an X-rated book I would have went to an adult book store. After the third chapter I threatened to throw the book in the trash. I will never buy another Wally Lamb book.
5,Just When I Thought It Couldn't Get Better....,"You know what? The first Wally Lamb book that I read was ""She's Come Undone"" and I thought that that was THE best book I ever read. Of course, I couldn't just stop there... I wanted more of Wally Lamb. Then I finally got my hands on ""I Know This Much is True."" And I was blown away. Lamb knows how to keep you HOOKED! The story is so intricate and intertwined with other little stories and so well-thought out it is unbelievable.Now, I must admit, I was a little bit disappointed with the ending. It seemed to rushed and far-fetched... as if Lamb was just wanted to put everything to an end. But other than that, this is a FANTASTIC book that I highly recommend that you read. I laughed and cried... and cried some more (and I promise you'll do the same...), and I spent a while reading it (its as thick as a dictionary!), but it was really worth all of that. If you liked ""She's Come Undone"" you MUST read ""I Know this Much Is True."""
5,Oh my gosh!!,"What a great book! Oh my gosh, it's huge, but it's wonderful.I can't wait until Wally Lamb writes more...This is one of Oprah's best books."
3,OK...readable but lacking realism,"The book pulls you in because the story is like a soap opera. Most of the characters have horrible childhoods and/or are being constantly bombarded with crisis after crisis. Yet I found this tolerable because of the bigger questions that Lamb is addressing: the point of our existence, faith & God, fate, etc. However, I was disappointed with the ""answers"" Dominick comes to find. I didn't care for the ending of the book at all...totally unrealistic and ridiculous."
5,AMAZING,"This book is almost nine hundred pages and i had absolutely no problem reading it and couldn't put it down in the three days it took me to read it. This book is awesome. The author some how draws you into Dominick's world with no turning back. Just when you think you know whats going to happen he gives you something completely different and it all ties together to make one of the best, if not the best book I've ever read. I've read both of this authors works and loved them both. I think this is the better of the two although the first one SHE'S COME UNDONE is almost just as good. I CAN'T WAIT 'till his next work comes out."
5,I know THIS much is true...,"This book ranks in the top 10 of my favorites. As a person who knows too well how mental illness can control someone's world (I have a family member who has been struggling with this for 40 years), it is obvious Wally Lamb has done his homework. A bi-polar personality can be treated, but the life of that person and those around him are always on the edge. Most true is the fact that , although modern medical science has provided wonderful treatments for schizophrenia, all too often the patient stops taking medication when he feels he has been cured. This makes for a vicious cycle of treatment, hospitalization,and false security. I was caught up in this book, and almost felt as if it was taking a toll on my own sanity. That is how good this book is. It was not too long of a read, and I highly recommend it to anyone who would like a glimpse of what dealing with mental illness is like. More tea, Mrs. Calabash?"
4,Fractured American Male?,"Is this the tale of the stereotypical emotionally unavailable male that we continue to raise in the US?Crazy things happen to people in the course of everyday life. Anger and arrogance seem to compound the difficulties Dominick faces. If he can move from the problem to destruction to resurrection to wholeness, will his problems be smoothed out? Lamb seems to think so.There is a ton of plot in this book and I am not one of those sophisticated readers that understood all the stuff about rabbits and monkeys, so I gave _I Know This Much Is True_ a four instead of a five. It remains one of the better books that I have read."
3,Haven't finished yet.....,"Help!! I have really struggled through the first 300 pages of this book but because of the rave reviews and all of these 5 star ratings I don't want to give up. Can anyone give me some motivation to keep going? Did anyone here have a hard time getting ""into"" this book?"
3,A five star story that was 300 pages too long,"I found the second half of this book to be the most interesting. It took me days to get through the first half, but I zipped through the second half in just one. Just a few chapters into the book I knew exactly where it was going to end up - I thought it was somewhat predictable - but I truly did enjoy the second half of the book and watching how we got to that predictable conclusion. The most fascinating parts for me were the portions of the book where his grandfather's story and his own were interwoven. Even though the first half of the book set the stage for the second, I think it could have been streamlined. Unlike most of the other reviews, I enjoyed Lamb's first book a great deal. I look forward to seeing what comes next from this writer."
3,"Great writing, but very poor and trivial ending","Dear Lamb. Next time, please follow through with the book and don't make such a commercial ending. You are an excellent writer who really knows how to capture the characters, but the ending just seems so trivial. If you had followed through this would have been a masterpiece"
4,Excellent recounting of the emotions we feel as we grow old,What I partuclarly like about Wally Lamb's books are their ability to evoke the quality of the feelings most of us go through growing up. This book has helped me to be a better parent by putting me in touch with the way I felt as a kid and how I wished my parents had reacted to those feelings. In addtion to all of this - its a great story.
3,Possibly 3.5??,"Wow. This book is long, and perhaps a slightly drawn out. I am just thrilled at finishing it finally. I felt this novel was at times tedious and badly edited, with the story up until the ending being a very dispondent and uninspiring look at life. This would not have mattered, as this is rectified at the ending, however 900 pages is a long time to glimpse into such a negitive and saddening piece. Like 'Shes come undone', all was resolved in a complete and circle like manner, which was can be construed as idealist and fairytale like, however also as inspiring and hopeful. A decent novel, but only for the patient. I prefered 'Shes come undone', however there were marked similarities between the pieces."
3,I know this much to be true--this book had to many words,"I found the first half a struggle, it seemed repetitive and Domonick isn't a very engrossing character. His trials and tribulations just seemed to go on and on. If I hadn't read the comments about the last half of the book, I probably wouldn't have finished it. I thought the supporting cast much more interesting. Once I arrived at the story of that dreadful grandfather, I was fascinated. I agree that the ending was a let down and not very interesting. I am also disappointed that some reviewers revealed the end of the book on-line. I loved ""She's Come Undone"" and look forward to Lamb's next book."
4,Great Book!,"I didn't get a thing done the 2 days it took me to read this book. The ending was a bit anti-climactic, but everything else was worth it. The way Wally Lamb guides us through ""poor"" Domenick's life was great. There were a few predictable moments but mostly I was glued to the page anticipating what would happen next. I also read She's Come Undone and this book is right up there."
3,"Tedious, VERY tedious. Soul searching the last few chapters","It's strange to be saying this about a book I actually read to the end. I didn't want to finish it but I HAD to. The last three to four chapters made a real impact on me but the rest, it was..........was..................TEDIOUS!!!! I can't say I didn't like it but I can say it's not a book I would recommend to many people. I think there was more than enough detail about ""old"" Dominick and his life story. Although it did shed light on things, I think it could have been done in a much less TEDIOUS way!"
5,Outstanding,"One of the best books I have ever read. I loved the writing style of this book and got deeply into it right away. The set up of plots in this story were so creative and all fell together so well. The characters were all so incredible and real life. When it came to the part of the book that began as Domenico Tempesta's story, I was upset to have to leave Domenic's story. Then once I would finish the portions of his grandfather's story, I was upset to have to leave that story to go back to Domenic's because they both take you right in and would stop with such cliffhangers! I was very sad to reach the end of the book. This book stays with you and seems so well written, that you can't help but wonder if some of it could be true. What an imaginitive and talented writer. I could have happily read another books worth of this story."
5,"I KNOW THIS MUCH IS TRUE, ITS A GREAT BOOK","I HEARD A LOT ABOUT THIS BOOK AND I HAD READ SHES COME UNDONE SO I GOT THIS ONE. I WAS INTIMIDATED AT FIRST BECAUSE IT WAS SO LONG, BUT I GOT HOOKED WITHIN THE FIRST PARAGRAPH. I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN.THE CHARACTERS ARE SO REAL AND LIKABLE (IT TAKES A WHILE FOR SOME). I THOROUGHLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE."
3,a bit too long...most interesting was the Grandfather's life,"Had to read for my book club. A little too long and a little too contrived. The ending was very neatly sewn up with all the parties coming out ahead emotioinally and financially. Maybe too neat of a tie up of loose ends to ring true or at least believable and it lost my sympathy for the narrator. Don't know why, but I had a tough time staying with it. Kept putting it down when it dragged but still was happy to pick it up again. My fellow club members liked it for the most part."
2,OOH CHILD!,"This book reminds me of ""Girl You Know It's True"" by Milli Vanilli, only it's a little longer."
5,Sensitive story very well written,One of those stories that builds slowly and brings the reader along on a journey into the emotional battery of the protagonist with a mentally ill brother. Worth reading; worth buying.
3,Stop me if you've heard this before...,"...identical twins, one mentally ill and suicidal, the other twin is a wise-cracking former teacher who quits that job after an emotional breakdown, Each twin has a borderline oedipal/hate relationship with their mother, an abusive father, etc., etc.Hmmm, could it be ""Prince of Tides""?While this book wasn't nearly as emotionally involving nor thereby as good as ""PoT"", it was still a good summer read. I breezed through the 900 pages in a week. I'll probably skip ""She's Come Undone"" but I would certainly read Lamb's next offering."
4,A good story with excellent closure.,"This is not the best book I've ever read, but I found myself almost obsessed with it. It was a lot of fun.I found the first part of the book rather depressing, but things picked up about 1/3 of the way through. It really could have been shorter, but most of the time it kept a good pace.Some of the twists and turns were a bit too remarkable, but I enjoyed the escape of reading something that wasn't exactly like real life. To me, the best part of the book was the end because it provided true closure. I was satisfied."
5,Psychology and Psychological Health,"Of course, this is a wonderful, moving novel, as many of you know. From a clinical psychologist's perspective, I found this book satisfying for a number of reasons. The book includes vivid pictures of schizophrenia, twins, abuse, depression, narcissism, cultural issues, effective clinical interventions, and personal growth. It paints a dramatic picture, but it also gives readers a more general image of how we can improve our own lives in sophisticated ways."
3,"A quick, fast paced read","I picked this book up on a Friday evening and finished it on the following Monday. The story itself was enjoyable but I agree with a previous reviewer who thought the ending was just a little too neat. Dominick's life did need to make a turn for the better since for a few months everything seems to be going against him, however, Lamb didn't leave much for the imagination.I wouldn't call this the best book I've ever read, not by a long shot, but it was worth spending a weekend with and then forgetting."
3,"COMPELLING PREMISE,TENDER IN SPOTS, YET SOMEWHAT CONTRIVED","I guess SHE'S COME UNDONE really set me up for a quirky off the wall, well told story, and don't get me wrong, Lamb is an excellent writer. I think he just got a little overambitious in this erffort. It appears that as he was nearing the end of the novel, he fell back on convention to tie up plot threads as neatly as Thomas' arm flap was sewn over. For such a big sprawling, messy novel (so like life!) the ending disappoints. But I will still take a disappointment from Lamb vs. a home run by a lesser writer."
5,"The best book I've read in a long, long time.","I consider myself to be well-read. If a new book comes out, I generally read it. This book, without a doubt is the best book I've read in a long, long time. The characters are real, completely developed. Whether it is mental illness or some other socially unacceptable disease ( e.g. addiction, etc.), we all know families ( or just our own) that have battled, both emotionally and socially with the plight. I know I can relate, I'm sure so many other people can as well.The only possble negative comment is the overly long distribes from his grandfather. It could have been shorter without losing any plot.This book touched me as no other has. Thank you Mr. Lamb for sharing your gifts."
5,Totally Awesome and moving! A MUST READ! Highly recommended,"This book's characters grabbed me from the beginning and I had a difficult time putting the story down, actually looking forward to what was going on in Dominck's life. This is a great show of emotion--all emotions!--and if find yourself not liking this book, you must be taking something out of context! This is real life situtation drama that had me laughing, crying, feeling frustration, anger, love, joy--you name it, I felt it. What I didn't like? That the fantastic story had to end! It's going to be awhile before I find a book of this magnitude to grab me and make me keep reading as this did. My hat's off to you, Mr. Lamb, on a book well written!"
2,"I read it to the end, but I wouldn't recommend it.","I was slightly disappointed when I finished I Know This Much Is True, and as more time passes, the more disappointed I am. I thought the ending too pat (the Native American connection, the ex-wife connection, the girlfriend connection), as if Lamb is attempting to make up for all the horrible anger throughout the rest of the book. In addition, some of the important characters (the social worker, the psychiatrist) were empty. Perhaps I was came with too many preconceived notions--I would have liked to read more from Thomas' perspective."
3,Brotherhood,"I liked this book, but as one of the other reviewers eluded to the length of the book....I, too, think just as much could have been said and said as good in fewer pages. There were times in the book that it really appeared the author was grasping for something to say. However, Mr. Lamb is definitely a good writer. He has a way of enticing you to quickly develop feelings and emotions regarding characters. If you are looking for an indepth book regarding family life and the emotional baggage that can be accompanied by being brothers....this is the book for you. This is not one of the best stories I have ever read regarding families, but the author was outstanding in his writing techniques. Kudos to Mr. Lamb for knowing how to hold the attention of the reader in regards to the story as well as the characters."
4,pretty interesting,"I actually overhear someone at work describe this book and expressed an interest in reading it afterward. Many weeks passed by so I bought my own copy. I had a newborn at the time and we were staying on our boat for the summer and I buzzed through it in a week (after work and while nursing) It was a fascinating look inside the mind of someone dealing with mental illness and how fine a line is drawn between sanity and insanity. I wouldn't call it a classic, but I sure enjoyed the book and felt challenged."
5,This book touched my Soul,"This book touched my heart and after I finished it, I thought about it for days. The characters became a part of me as I read this book, in a mere 5 days. I couldn't put it down. The ending made me cry, for Dominik, for Thomas, for Ray. I loved this book, one of the best I have ever read."
4,Beautiful book - even with that end.,"After reading this book, I was felt slightly let down. Only because of the way, as has been pointed out before, that everything was neatly tied up in the end. However, if we were to ignore the last chapter, this would rank as the best book I have ever read. This book is emotional, telling, and captivating. Every person could identify with at least one character, and the beauty of that is that no character is perfect. Each character's flaws are presented in an objective manner - which leaves the reader responsible for deciding who the hero is. Told in Mr. Lambs typical style of heavy slang, this is a wonderful book."
5,An author beyond compare,"In this novel, Mr. Lamb has provided an example of the best that literary fiction has to offer. It is THE best book that I have had the woderful good fortune to read. He uses complex literary devices seamlessly. He presents multiple levels of meaning in a challenging, but not pretentious, way. The plot has bizarre elements, but it is never hard to believe. He presents a multitude of opportunities for the imagination to wander, but he also keeps a tight rein on the events ensuring that they are all relevant. His characters are excruciatingly real. I cannot imagine how he is able to weave the elements of this complicated story together so effectively. I am anxiously awaiting his next creation!"
2,"Truth is, its brutal.","Violent, oppressive, and perverse. Woven into its lunatic fabric are at least four murders, a like number of suicides, and dozens of other ugly crimes against humanity. An encyclopedic variety of aberrant sexual behavior is featured throughout. Most characters are disturbed, unstable, or abusive. Death seems the best solution to many problems.Well crafted descriptions of turn of the century Italian customs, immigration, and living conditions are welcome relief, so is nostalgia from 50's and 60's. Discussion of the unique psychological makeup of identical twins is interesting.On balance, dark and ugly. An easy pick for Oprah because it is chock full of talk show loser types to whom her industry owes its existence."
4,Worth the effort!!,"This is the first book of Wally's that I have read - and now I'll go back to ""She's Come Undone"". As I am currently living in New Zealand, there are a great deal of American Writers that we do not have access to - Amazon.com has changed that for me, I am very glad to say - PLUS, of course, Oprah's recommendations. This book was an effort - mainly because 'life' did not allow me time to spend endless hours lapping up the wonderful and inspiration words. It has really made me take a look at my life - and appreciate the joy and beauty that I am surrounded with on a daily basis. They say that you don't appreciate what is around you - but I must say that Wally's truly fabulous book has made me appreciate how blessed I am - and not to take anything for granted anymore. THANK YOU!!"
4,A slow start to a great novel,"When I first started reading I Know This Much is True, I wasn't sure how I would make it through the 900+ pages. However, perserverance paid off! When the plot really gets going, it's hard to put this one down. Lamb does an excellent job of building his characters and weaving a detailed plot. I Know This Much is True is a realistic look at modern family life and the struggles between siblings."
2,"Oh come on, seriously!?!?!?","So, I read this book because I heard that it was supposed to be amazing, and Wally Lamb's other book was pretty good. So when I started reading this, I could that it was his style... written well enough for me to keep turning the page. But after the first 300 pages, I was so over listening to the main character whine about how everything in his life sucks and it's not his fault. The ridiculousness of what continued on with this story resembles a storyline from Days of our Lives. And as I kept reading, the more outrageous the things that happened. HOW could this book be so popular and considered one of the BEST books? I think it makes a mockery of what happens in families with mental disease is hit, who DON'T have the craziest of overly dramatic lives and live day to day for REAL. I'm giving it two just because Wally Lamb puts good sentences together. The thing is, there's far too many of them that gets you nowhere, except further in his unbelieveable soap opera."
1,Could not proceed after one fourth of the book.,"I bought this book because of the subject matter, thinking it could be fascinating and if I could have gotten past the terrible language and the taking of diety's name in vain every sentence, I might have found some merit. Why could'nt the author just have told the story without the garbage. This book is going in the trash. Sorry."
1,A potentially good book that gets lost in the foul language.,"I really enjoyed Lamb's ""She's Come Undone"" which is why I picked up this book. However, I was very disappointed in the authur's excessive and gratuitous use of four letter words among other expletives. He is such a talented writer that I'm sure he would have a much more effective way to have his narrator communicate. The excessive use of foul language does not fit the character who is narrating the story nor does it propel the story line."
3,I Recuse Myself From This Book,"Why is it that in order to sell books, authors these days have to debase themselves by hawking their tomes on Oprah?By definition, that means the book is written for sub-literate soccer moms and other assorted half-wits.Even if this were a great book (it just may well be), I have only so much money in my budget for buying books.Therefore, I will have to take a pass.Authors: Think about the company you keep! Not all of us admire the bovine goddess of daytime TV."
1,"If I'm not into it 100 pages in, will I ever be?","I am also reading Tom Wolfe's new book, and there is no comparison. Lamb's book reminds me of a college creative writing effort, full of whining nonsense and what I consider a meandering story line. Everybody says it's so great, but I guess it's not my type of book. Everybody also said Prince of Tides was great, and I found it the same as Lamb's: a male author with a feminine style, a stream of consciousness tome from the perspective of an individual that I really don't like. Maybe I'll skip to the end to see if there ever was a point."
5,I read the negative reviews.,"People who thought it has too much sex and vulgarity. I'm an adult who's okay with reading about lots of sex and vulgarity. People who thought that it was too long, could have been a few hundred pages shorter, needed a better editor, etc. I never thought I'd have the attention span to read a 900 page book, the not once did I think to myself ""this is too long."" People who didn't like any of the characters with the exception of his therapist. I'm okay with unlikeable characters. I don't have to like a character as a person to enjoy reading about them. People who thought that it was unrealistic, too depressing, melodramatic, etc. I can see that. But for me personally, it wasn't. The ending was a little disappointing but I enjoyed the rest of it so much that I don't even care."
5,I know this much is true...,"This book reminded me in many ways of Steinbeck's East of Eden. It is truly epic, gripping, with subtle hints of magic realism. After staying up until 2:30am to finish, it left me crying for about half an hour - for myself and for the characters (all of them) the same way I did when I read EoE in highschool. This book absolutely has the power to transform the reader. This book will, or should, be studied in years to come."
3,I was compelled to finish it despite its weaknesses.,"Within this book of epic proportion is a deep and moving story that compelled me to pursue my reading to the very end. Had this novel's contents been edited more thoroughly, and the author's choice of words pertaining to sex been less course and adolescent, the book certainly would have had been 5 star. I often found myself skipping entire paragraphs, and at times pages, when reading papa's memoirs. Unfortunately, its weaknesses did interfere with my ability to truly cherish and enjoy the story. Do I feel like I have lost a friend now that its finished? No. I was a bit relieved."
5,A MUST READ!,"Do not be turned away from this book because of its size. After reading only the first couple pages i couldnt put it down! This book is about a man named Dominick and his schizophrenic twin brother. Living in a family and a life that is on the edge of falling apart, this novel will lead your through the memories and tragedies of Dominicks journey from childhood into adulthood. Dominick struggles to find his own identity. The main theme of this book is that life is full of tears and laughter, loss and gain, joy and sorrow. Wally captivates the reader through the emotions and compelling life that this family endured."
2,What's the allure?,"I dutiflly plowed through all 900 or so pages of this book andjust do not understand why it is considered worthwhile. The book wasso full of unlikely and wholesale turmoil -- even including the improbable life of the dead grandfather (one brother killed for adultery, the other for falling off a roof while seeking to comfort his monkey-mistress) -- that after a while each plot ""turn"" just made me laugh. Consider this: if you described this book to someone who had not read it, what would he or she say to you? They'd say, I suspect, that it sounded like a bad Jerry Springer show. The ridiculous ""plot"" -- if any there was -- combined with the gratuitous adolescent descriptions of sex and needless profanity, made this book banal at best. The only redeeming feature was the Indian psychiatrist, who was a delight. For my two cents -- use your reading time of 900 pages on something more realistic or at least better written."
3,"three and a half stars: Abusive men, twins, rabbits and monkeys","Obviously, Wally Lamb can write well. Anyone who can write a cohesive 900 page novel that manages to hold one's interest throughout must have talent. But, for me, ""I Know This Much is True,"" is overwritten and overbloated with metaphor and (especially) parallelism. The Yin/Yang of Dominic and Thomas, the generational spanning connection between Dominic and his grandfather -- it all became just a bit too much. And the way things tie up in the end, especially the redemption of Dominic's abusive stepfather, made me roll my eyes and yell out loud ""Oh come on!"" It's as if the author tries to push the envelope with the reader -- perhaps unlike others, I just had trouble buying the whole thing.If you're interested in reading this author, you should probably start with the considerably shorter ""She's Come Undone."" If you really like that one, read this one."
2,"C'mon, people, get a grip on yourselves","Months after finishing this book, I like it much less in retrospect. I'm also appalled at the large number of 5-star reviews it's garnered here--obviously, Oprah inspires a lot of people to read particular titles who don't very often read books in general. Five stars?!? You've got to be kidding me. This book wears its very considerable flaws on its sleeve; the _deux ex machina_ are hokey and unrelenting; and, as writing, the whole soppy mess is practically the definition of ""undisciplined."" I think a lot of people may have discovered to their wonderment that hey, yes, it *is* possible to locate an analog of their favorite sappy TV show between hardcovers, but they ought to get a grip. This may be way-above-average trash, but it's still firmly anchored in that genre. If you're a real reader, you might well do better elsewhere--despite the torrent of gushy responses here."
2,Pretty boring,"I loved She's Come Undone, and had heard good things about I Know This Much is True so I picked it up at the library. Despite the size, I got through it pretty quickly and wasn't really satisfied at the end. This book was in severe need of an editor. Once he got into putting in every part of his grandfather's book I lost interest in the novel and it just dragged on until the end, with nothing really happening until the very end of the book. I wouldn't really reccomend this book. If you want to read a great book by Wally Lamb, go read She's Come Undone instead."
1,I tried I honestly tried...,"I just couldn't get through it. Not one to ever put down a book even if it has lost me the first 15 pages in, I had to give up on this one. Perhaps I am at a time in my life when dark and dreary and down right depressing just isn't what I am looking for. But I promise I will try again, just at a different point in time when I can tackle the horrific imagary Lamb conjures up and get by the social realities I sometimes perfer not to be reminded of."
1,Congratuations To Us!,"One can only surmise that the bewildering proliferation of five stars here relates mostly to the Self Congratulations effect, whereby the readers-- many having just finished their first ""big book""-- are, in effect, slapping themselves on the back for trudging through this monstrosity in dire need of a lucid editor. Reminds me of that weird psycho-syndrome in which kidnapping victims fall in love with their kidnappers."
1,Skip the audiobook this time!,I love Wally Lamb but this abridgement left a string of tragic events behind and took away all of the detail and character development. I actually grew to hate the reader!
4,Very Good,"I don't want to be one of those who compare books, because that isn't fair, but his first one, I feel was better. I could relate to the character more (1992's She's Come Undone). Yet Wally Lamb still wows me with his prose and his incredible portrait of the perfectly imperfect Dominick Birdsey. Thomas was an excellent character, too. What I love about Mr. Lamb is that he makes you care, whether you want to or not. This book is incredibly deep. The 900+ pages shouldn't scare anyone off..the content more than makes up for the length. And the length is needed. What is also needed is more books like these. Today's flimsy pop-fiction bestsellers cannot compare to the intelligence and depth this book contains. More authors should spend the time crafting their work as exquisitely as Mr. Lamb."
5,To all you freightened by the 900 page-length!,"Don't let the length of this tome scare you. The story is so engaging that you will want to take the week off from work and just read it in one marathon sitting.The protagonist is a neoclassical hero who not only needs to protect his brother but also needs to look inside himself and discover how to trust, how to forgive and how to love. In the act of destroying his mind set he saves the most imporatant person in his life (read to find out who).So, call your boss, brew a pot of coffee, and settle down to a great book."
5,Wally Lamb is a truly gifted writer.,"I was drawn into this book from the first page and, although it is a long book, it goes pretty quickly because it's impossible to put down. I was amazed at how Domenico (the grandfather) had a voice so different from Dominick's I could even hear his Italian accent! I can only hope Mr. Lamb writes another book soon because after this book and SHE'S COME UNDONE I am a devoted fan forever."
5,A novel that delivers,I tend to prefer non-fiction but this novel was so complete and vivid that my suspension of disbelief was easily upheld. I could not put it down.
5,"Entertaining, as always","This is the 2nd novel I have read from Wally Lamb, and he really is an incredible author. The way he writes makes you feel like you are right there with him, and the words he chooses make you feel like you just might be talking to your friend. He doesn't like to choose words that are over your head; he chooses words and phrases that are carried on in normal every day conversations. A very good read and highly recommended for someone who loves to curl up with an excellent, BIG book."
3,"Interesting themes, but far too many","I am shocked by the number of people who say this is one of their favorite novels, a classic, deserves six stars, etc., etc. For me, it was a solid three stars. Lamb's prose is unremarkable, but consistant. The last two hundred pages or so are simply unnecessary. If he'd stopped there, this book would have been a thoughtful meditation on family, twinhood, and mental illness. My biggest complaint is, as previous reviewers have mentioned, Lamb simply lays it on too thick. Just when the story's come together, he throws in every wrench known to mankind. The sentimental come-to-God ending is both implausible and disappointing after 800 pages of build-up. I probably wouldn't recommend this one."
4,totally compelling read,"I was thoroughly engrossed by this book. This is an extremely compassionate, insightful book. I was slightly letdown in the last 100 pages as the book moved swiftly ( a bit too neat and clean in my opinion ) to bring the various threads to resolution. Wally lamb is a superb writer with a great deal of insight into the interior lives of people."
5,"Captivating, Incredible... definite ""BUY IT""","This book is one of the few books that had me completely hooked from the beginning. I had not read ""She's Come Undone"" at the time I read this, so was totally unfamiliar with the author. Wow....The character development is incredible, the intertwining stories amazingly done. I shed more than a few tears!Definite read...."
5,Can't put down!!,"This is a fantastic book! However reader beware..this isn't about pixie dust and beautiful faries..the book does throw the reader into the depressed world of Dominick Birdsey, brother of Thomas Birdsey who is a schizophrenic. But you really learn to love Dominick despite his rough edges. The manuscript about Dominick's grandfather is almost like reading two books in one...a fantastic tale of pain and secrecy. But be assured, despite a sad beginning you will feel satisfied by the end."
5,I know this one is great,"Just finished this marathon...wonderfully and warmly written with less of the somewhat disjointed prose which characterized his first book. Mr. Lamb is developing into an easily readable author who possesses that great quality sought for by those of us with hectic lives...namely his books are easily readable, easy to put down for another day, while not missing a beat, and written in the prose which we baby boomers can relate to. Like a Mahler symphony...our main character spends most of the opus in hell...only to recover in a blaze of glory at the end..kinda gives you goose-pimples and warm fuzzies, that last chapter. My only criticism..too much hell, not enough heaven...you'll see...one of my favorite reads of all time..not to be missed by anyone."
4,Didn't want to put it down.,"Didn't want it too end, got tired of reading the Grandfather's history, & was sad when it the whole story did end. I know people who have gone through difficult times in their lives & was able to become stronger because of it once they dealt with the horrible things of there past. It's probably more true to life then people realize!"
4,Thought provoking and insightful.,"I throughly enjoyed this book for a number of reasons. I found the characters to be believable and honest. Having grown up in a household with a mentally ill brother an immigrant father, and a socially deprived mother, I related to many of Dominick's feelings. Mr. Lamb has created very memorable characters. It was well written and kept my interest throughout."
5,A MASTERPIECE,I have just finshed this book and at the same time have wiped my tears. The chacters are real and I feel I know them. I see that the main problems that the other reviewers have with the book is the tidy ending and the subject matter. I had a problem with neither. I felt myself going back in to my own childhood and rememebering events that seem so distant and so far away. Mr. Lamb you are incredible and this book NEEDS to be taught in schools around the world. Thank you for writing this and enhancing my life.
4,A wonderful journey culminating in a mediocre destination,"I was thoroughly sucked into this book, including the story within a story of the main character's grandfather. I loved the imperfections of Dominick, et al., but was very disappointed in the neatly wrapped-up ending. Life doesn't all work out in the end and I was not expecting it here. Everything leading up to the last few pages, however, was exquisite."
5,Brilliant!,"Worth every one of the 900 pages... and more. The ending was a bit to tidy, but I welcome happy endings when I can get them!!!"
4,A book worth taking the time to read,"This book kept me interested through all of its almost 900 pages. I really felt the pain and confusion of the main character. I even got annoyed with him when he lashed out against people in the ""system"" and when he blamed himself for his brother's behavior. I felt his humiliation at the ""bus"" incident and found myself thinking about this book long after I had finished reading it. Wally Lamb had written another winner."
4,Couldn't put it down,"It is a good thing that my husband was out of town when I read this, because I would only have ignored him. I couldn't put this book down. The length might turn some readers off, but it was totally worth it. Excellent, excellent story. You experience the struggle right along with Dominick. I couldn't wait to reach the end, but was sorry to leave the characters when I finished."
3,Not as good as his first one,"I didn't think this book was as his good as his first novel, ""She's Come Undone."" It has a lot of the same themes, and the title character is actually a little bit better, but Lamb's attempts to make the plot more mystical with all that stuff about the old Italian grandfather--A) it was boring and childish, B) it took up too much space. I did like the characters and the narrative flow was quite good, but overall it was just too unseemly and, at times, immature."
4,A good read,"I had a really hard time getting into this book, but persisted. By about page 200 or so it finally started clicking and I decided to stick with it. Good choice, as it did indeed get better. A good read all around."
2,I wanted to like it. Really.,"There are 200 pages of meat and 700 pages of hamburger helper in this tome of angst. The occasional sparkling line, gem of dialouge and the great ending in ""She's Come Undone"" were the things that kept me reading. I quickly grew tired of the sex, the recriminations about sex, the variety of sex, the endless descriptions of sex and, finally, the sex. The other thing I tired of was the analysis, the recriminations about analysis, the variety of analysis, the endless descriptions of analysis and, finally, the analysis. Those horses, while not beaten dead, were certainly on life support.I look forward to the next Lamb book now that he has this out of his system."
1,"Trendy, overated","I picked up this book, expecting to enjoy it as much as I enjoyed ""She's Come Undone"". This story reads like too many ""Jerry Springer"" or ""Oprah Winfrey"" shows. Enough about child abuse. I could not even finish it, I was so bored by it."
1,Too Long !!!!,"I bought this book as soon as it came out because I had read ""She's Come Undone"" and liked it . I have tried many a time to try to read this book. But each time I try I feel as though it will never end. I would like to read the whole book or at least know how it ends but, everytime I try I get so bored I fall asleep. This book moves way too slow for me! I feel they take way too long to get a point across in this book. I hope his next book is shorter or at least faster paced. I gave up on it. Maybe his next book will be better."
5,Wally Lamb has done it again!,"Wally Lamb tells the story of Dominick Birdsey, a middle-aged man whose identical twin suffers from schizophrenia. Throughout the novel Dominick is learning to accept his brother's illness and trying to discover who he is by looking to the people closest to him and finding out who they are. As the reader you are drawn into Dominick's world of love, anger, confusion, and frustration.Do not let the size of this novel intimidate you. I found myself disappointed when I reached the final page! Wally Lamb has once again created a masterpiece."
5,Takes one to know one,"Being a twin myself, I have always found myself short of words in describing just how deep, complicated and haunting it is. Now it seems like all I have to do is hand out this book to whom ever asks me for the upteenth time - ""What is it like to be a twin ?"" (as if I know any different...). This books tells it as it - the competition, the fear, the struggle for independence, the love and the hate, the push and the pull. When I finished this book I felt drained out. Its like the book put a mirror at my face and made me confront my true self. Besides being a wonderful, well written novel on the test of faith, this is a must read for twins and anyone who wants to understand what being a twin is really about. Now all I have to do is gather the courage to let my twin read it..."
5,Powerful book,"Wow- a major novel, a powerful book, about an ordinary guy. Wally Lamb is a superb writer. I even liked how it ended. I read it a couple of years ago, and still think about it. It is the kind of book that stays with you."
1,"It was so bad, I couldn't even finish it","The dialogue in the book was totally unbelievable, the characters were unlikable, and Wally Lamb was entirely too wordy. I found myself skimming paragraphs and saying blah, blah, blah, get to the point already. A very disappointing read, considering how good ""She's Come Undone"" was."
1,"depressing, definitely not light summer reading","Depicts the worst depravities of life: suicide, murder, AIDS, SIDS, self-mutilation, spousal abuse, ad nauseum. Is this a case of the emporer's new clothes, because it was recommended by Oprah?"
3,Disappointed,"First, let me just say that I loved ""She's Come Undone."" Wouldn't have changed a word. So, with great anticipation, I bought ""I Know This Much Is True.""Unfortunately, although the dialogue does ring true to life in this one as well, there's way too much of it. I kept thinking, ""Where is Wally Lamb's editor?"" Furthermore, I wonder what the deal is with all the italics. Everyone's dialogue includes frequent italics (not just one hysterical character), which annoyed me a great deal. I would like to be able to hear the dialogue in my head the way I want to hear it, and not have it forced on me. I must agree with other reviewers, who say that there is too much going on here. Too much in-depth analysis of too many characters with too many issues.The story is interesting, though, and I think it's worth reading. I just wish I had checked it out from the library instead of buying it."
5,A Wonderful Tale,"Wow, a truly amazing story. Once I began reading about Dominick and Thomas's saga I couldn't put the book down. It has to be one of the best books I've read. Mr. Lamb has a truly sincere and heart wrenching way of letting you in on his character's mind and emotions. ""I Know This Much is True"" weaves a tale that has you clinging onto to its every strand, never letting go."
2,300 Pages to Long,"I enjoyed Wally Lamb's ""She's Come Undone""--even though I felt by the end of the book it had gone on about 50 pages too long. Now, with ""I Know This Much is True,"" the author really goes on too long. You spend hundreds of pages with the main angst ridden character, who just churns through his same problems and thoughts over and over and over, with no progress in sight. The character becames stagnant and all I wanted to do was shout out, ""Get over it!"" By the time I reached page 500, all I kept thinking was, ""this book needs to be edited down badly."" I couldn't even finish the last 200+ pages. Instead, I skipped to the end just to see what, if anything, is finally resolved. Several of my friends and family read the book and felt the same way. In fact, my mother said she lost interest half way through, put it down, and has yet to pick it back up."
1,Don't waste your time with this book,"Unless you want to be sad every minute you open this book- do not read it. Just when you thought things would get better for ANY of the characters, terrible things continued to ravage and destroy them emotionally and physically. This book was the most depressing book I have ever read.I finished the book only to be rewarded with an unbelievable happy (BAD) ending that in no way matched the miserable rhythm of the story. The cheap ending made me angry that I had wasted my time getting through the gloomy story with hopes of a ""reader reward"" that did not come.Don't waste your time and money."
4,A Must Read,"This is an excellent book. Wally Lamb has really done it this time. It takes a while for this book to really get going (about 300pgs. in), but once it takes off hold on to your hat. It is a wonderful tale of self discovery, acceptance, and forgiveness. Three things we all need to find in our own lives."
4,"heavy (litterally, :-P) but over all it's worth it","This is a very captivating novel, a read page-turner, despite it's enourmousness. With it's well portrayed characters, and personalized greif, you really feel like you are in the book and can relate to the main character, Dominick Birdsey. He's a man of all seasons; he can be coragous, loving, protective, and most importantly, he has a great sense of responsibility. He's a real noble character. Even though the central plot is really depressing at times, Dominick's sardonic tone and over-all self-deprication make the novel extremely interesting. I'd recommend this book to anyone who's looking for profound reading in fiction."
4,I couldn't put this book down!!,"Wally Lamb is a wonderful writer. I was so impressed with his first book, She's Come Undone, that I had to run out and get this one!! It's a change from the previous but just as enjoyable. Not only did I enjoy the book, but I was also able to learn from it. I am anxious to see what Mr. Lamb is working on next......"
5,Excellent character development,I love books that take time to introduce the reader to characters and really let us get to know them. I've read both of Mr. Lamb's books now - She's Come Undone and I Know This Much is True - and thought they were great.
4,Read this book!,"When I began to read this book I asked myself why I was entering such a dysfunctional and depressing world. The answer was quickly delivered to me with the richness and humaness that Wally Lamb delivers so well.As in She Comes Undone, Lamb speaks out loud that which we tend to keep hush-hush, the screwed up family unit. We are transported into the heart and soul of Domenick Birdsey, an average guy trying to come to terms with his illegitimate birth, twinness and slim escape from mental illness. His struggle offers hope to those of us who wonder if we can escape the legacy of our births.I would recommend this book to anyone who feels that they are alone in their questioning of self. A great read.Since every book review must be objective, I must also add that I was a bit disappointed in Lamb's pat clean-up at the end. Real life does not work that way. And this is a real life read."
5,OUTSTANDING!,"First time I'm motivated to write a review... This book was captivating, moving, creative, authentic... a joy to read, every word."
4,The characters live!,"Wally Lamb's characters live. I don't think I have ever read such a lenghty book that was so evenly metered. Never once did I lose interest! I especially liked the way the book tied together past and present. And, for me, the ending of the book in which Dominick told us what he learned from life was wonderful. It was great to read something which dealt with realistic, painful themes and yet ended so hopeful. I highly recommend this book."
4,Amazing,Enjoyed the 900 pages. An incredible story and well written. Wally Lamb detailed one's man journey through his life and encountering many challenges that one did not speak of in their time.
3,Great Story But Painfully Long,I decided to give this book a shot because everyone at my local Barnes and Noble was raving about it but I'm a little disappointed. The story itself is great but it would be just as great 200 pages shorter. The main character is also very hard to like because he is so arrogant and cynical. I also did not care for the Grandfather's Autobiography. I don't feel it added much to the story and he's the most unlikable character of them all.
3,too long,"This was an ok read, I just feel like it was waaaaaay too long. I think the story could have been told in half of the pages. There were alot of good parts, but they came after a lot of wording that could have been left out. I am so glad to be done with it. I am going to try and read She's Come Undone. I hope it's not as daunting as this one."
5,ignore the oprah stigma;,"instead, immerse yourself in wally lamb's sea of words. i started this book as a joke, largely; i had read ""she's come undone"" and quite liked it, if only because, no joke, i dated a girl, once upon a time, who was much like that novel's protagonist, although i quite enjoyed lamb's style. i figured i'd dip into his new one occasionally, like every other huge novel that comes into the store ready for a reader.two days later, i was returning it to the stack, every word read, amazed at the experience i had had. i hope that lamb's next novel is a bit shorter (and that this time, he learns how to devise a plausible denouement), but i know for a fact that i'll read it the day it comes out. he's that good. he's nowhere near pynchon's neighborhood- he's not even in pynchon's borough- but if we need to anoint a new dickens, he's a pretty fine candidate."
4,alluring and shallow all at once,"I had a hard time putting this book down, and didn't know why. Nothing real ""specific"" was there to grasp on to. None the less, he really grabbed my attention and wouldn't let go. I would only hope that the underlinings of the book weren't made so obvious. I didn't get the opportunity to figure them out on my own."
3,Fascinating story,"There were parts of this book that were so moving, so descriptive. I really love Wally Lamb's style and his gift of description. However, there were 2 things that bothered me about this book--1, in the Grandfathers memoirs, the overuse of the Italian words. Everything else is translated, why does he leave a few words here and there in Italian? To show his (Mr. Lamb's) knowledge of Italian? Certainly these words are translateable and certainly the woman in the story translating the italian and sicilian knew these words. It just got annoying after a while. 2, I had so, so many questions about this book and would love to talk them over with someone. I think this book is best for a book club or in a group, not solo."
3,Coulda Used Some Choppin',"I listened to the unabridged recording of this gargantuan novel -- read by George Guidall, 23 cassettes, 32 hours! It took me like two months to get through the whole thing, and it was barely worth it. Had I'd been reading instead of listening to it, I have a feeling I would have skipped a page here and there.I fully believe a good editor could have knocked off a good 200-300 pages off of this novel. There are many moments where the main character, Dominick, just goes on and on about the same thing he'd just said a chapter ago.The section I found most interesting was the story within a story, the tale of Dominick's grandfather. It was wacky, funny, and fantastic, and the voice of the Italian immigrant was done very nicely (probably more Guidall than Lamb). The ending was my least favorite -- everything wrapping up a little too nicely. Oh, and I also liked Joy -- her story is also out there and quite good."
5,This is one of the best books I've ever read!!,I identified with this book because I have a schizophrenic brother. The book held my interest right from the beginning through the very end. I feel this is a must read!
4,Wonderful!,"I loved this book! The author did a wonderful job of making sure that his readers were feeling the pain and joy of each character. (The only reason I'm giving this book 4 stars, instead of 5 is that I got a little lost on the ""monkey"" part of the book)."
5,The best book I have read in a long time,"What can I say I loved this book. I felt for all the characters. I could not put it down, although it was a large book the time went so quickly and it was so sad when it ended. I found it spoiled me for another book for quite a while."
2,Couldn't wait for the book to end,"I couldn't wait for this book to end. To me, the quality of a great book is that you are sorry that it is ending; this book made me wish it would just be over. I can't understand why so many people are raving about it."
5,My best book of 1998,"I was truly sad when this book ended. As one of a set of fraternal twins, I was touched by many of the situations described in this book. Mr. Lamb has a rare and valuable skill for knowing and describing the gamut of human conditions and emotions. He clearly did his research for 'I Know This Much Is True'."
4,Frustratingly Delicious!,"After a slow beginning, I locked in about one third of the way through. A beautifully written profile of family dysfunction and how we have the power to turn it around if only we can forgive others and ourselves. My biggest complaint is the constant, not just occasional abuse of the Lord's name. Was that necessary every other sentence? No one else was disturbed? I am sure Wally Lamb wanted to portray a ""Godless"" man, but, oh please!! Take out the bad language it was a perfect read!!"
4,A solid sophomore outing,"I confess that I was unprepared for Lamb's second novel. After ""Undone"" I was expecting another girl growing up tome, which while effective, never quite had me convinced that Lamb understood the female mind. This book layers one bad event over the other and yet, although not quite John Irving, manages to maintain a sense of humor. A bit long , the flashback fascinates those of us who think a twin is merely another sibling. Worth the money."
4,"A GOOD BOOK, WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!",I thought this was a very good book. I think there could have been a little more to the ending but other than that it was excellent!
2,Couldn't finish it.,"I'm usually not a quitter, but this book bored the heck out of me about 2/3rds of the way through and I just had to stop. It was sooooo slow and boring. I can't really think of anything good to say about it."
3,"Long, so boring, slow read, just sooo DULL","I have to tell you, I got to half way through this novel and came downstairs to re-read the reviews. They gave me hope that the book was worth it.OHMYGOSH it's SO SLOW and so drawn out. I've read a lot of books and this is by far one of the most overrated. It's so slow and boring. The first half could have taken place over four pages.I hate reading a review written by someone who never finished the book, but ohmygosh this is dull and just horrid. If you read two chapters and have little more than a failing interest in the book, drop it. Dump it. Go read Pillars of The Earth..a long, drawn out book that is totally worth every page."
2,Hollywood pulp,"Wally Lamb did his research then through it all into the book in the worst cliched characters I've come across in a while. Cliched twins, cliched, cliched scizophrenic character, cliched stepfather, cliched institution, cliched Italian immigrant and the list goes on.This is not to say this was,nt a page turner, it was, but it doesn't deserve any literary recognition. He should take out the last chapter, it just such a hollywood wrap up and takes all our imagination away. This book won,t drag me into reading an American book for a while ."
1,This book was trashy and I hated it.,"I can't figure out what all the hype is about. I found this book offensive, filled with foul language and a deffinite waste of my time. If this is the sort of trash people think is a fabulous must read, I fear for the moral decay of our civilization. I was disappointed that Oprah would suggest such a depressing and lousy book."
2,bleh,"This book--not so great. I'm not impressed with Oprah's track record so far. I know I will meet alot of opposition to this, but this book is not interesting, especially considering the fact that you have to wade through 5 million pages of it.I am a twin, and found the book smacked with insincerity as far as that relationship. The writing style was annoying, and the ending a completely unrealistic letdown. Don't buy this book unless you have bad taste."
3,i never got it,I'm sorry but my book was sent to an old address and i never got it. Amazon has my correct address. I do not think the vendor checked my address with amazon
3,Pretty good,"A good book. I'd recommend it to anyone thinking of buying it. Its very interesting seeing the life of twins, one of which has a mental illness."
2,"Ugh, I Thought It Would Never End","This is the most overrated book I have ever read. I kept waiting for it to get interesting and it just never did. I agree with one critic when he said: ""This is not writing. This is typing."" Unless you like the classic writers of the Russian genre, where every little detail is set down and tramped on, you will not like this book."
3,Well worth reading,"Yes, you've heard already that this monster is over 900 pages. But, rest assured, it's not hard to read. I don't regret buying it for a moment. The voice of the narrator is particularly strong, and there is no one character or episode that seems unbelievable. But somehow, at times, I'd consider the odds of all these particular events happening to this particular person, and my credibility was stretched a little thin. But even so, reading this book is a fine way to spend a day. Very imaginative."
2,Badly in need of editing.,"Tempted by the wonderful memories of Lamb's first book, ""She's Come Undone"", I dove into this needlessly thick second book. The main character was a rambling loser, which could have been interesting. Instead, I kept wishing he would gain some insight, or say something clever, or perhaps die. Rather, there was a great deal of cluttering free association and meaningless chit chat."
2,Much ado about very little,"Again, I am appalled at the outrageous support this novel has received from so many. I bought it with a lot of anticipation, having enjoyed She's Come Undone, even though that book was flawed, it was at least an entertaining read. This tome however, is a depressing mishmash of pschobabble, dysfunctional family memoir, and boring, unnecessary Italian immigrant history lesson."
2,"Loved ""She's Come Undone"" but skipped chapters in this one.","I was so stoked when this book came out because I loved ""She's Come Undone"" and recommended it to everyone I know. When I started this book I was intrigued by the first chapters - Thomas cutting off his hand and learning about the history of the Birdsey's. But, nothing about this book ever drew me in. I liked Dominick but this book was like a bad joke where one bad thing after another happens. There was no real substance to this and after a while it was so predictable that I could have written chapters myself. Also, I thought the grandfather's story did nothing for the book and could have cut down the size considerably."
2,Fatally flawed,"I wanted to like this book......I tried to like this book......I really liked large chunks of this book....The subject is interesting, I liked the main character, Dominick, and his brother Thomas, and all of their bizzare friends, family and situations. I don't have trouble with lengthy books. I was buying the whole thing.....until the ""text-in-text;"" it didn't work. I know lots of Italians and none of them are obsessed with monkeys. I was really disappointed. I cried at the end...it was touching, but mostly I was discouraged. I thought Lamb had potential as a writer but I'm starting to think maybe not. If you want to read a really well-written ""text-in-text"" with plenty of dysfunction to go around, try Posession by A.S. Byatt."
3,Western type revenge theme with female lead & social theme,"This is a western with a theme familiar to fans of American westerns: revenge. But it is a bit different in that it has a female as the hero and deals with a problem that to this day is still ongoing in Brazil: the unequal distribution of land and the killing of squatters by rich ranchers. Undoubtedly the social theme strikes some resonance in the hearts of socially sensitive Brazilians, but is less interesting to Americans no doubt.Luzia's parents are killed by ranchers and she seeks her revenge. She is the strong, silent hero similar to the American tradition, but the ""revenge"" is very uneven and somewhat unsatisfactory. Dr. Patrick L. Cooney, Ph.D. sociology"
4,a cute slip,This slip is very cute with elaborate embroidery. The material feels a little more polyestery rather than silky. It is very comfortable as a nightgown.
2,Book too basic,Cover of book indicates it is for all levels. Actually the book is very basic and does not adequately go into the advanced features of PowerPoint. I teach PP and need procedures for customizing presentations and resolving problems caused by students random pointing and clicking. The only reason I bought it sight unseen was I could not find a Que book and the publication date was the latest of the titles found in the Amazon data base.
2,Keep looking,"Glad I got this book from the library insteadof spending money. Almost impossible to use thisas a reference, and it isn't a very good tutorialeither. A disappointment."
3,Meh,"I like this stuff, but you have to use a LOT to get much flavor. But maybe that's just a personal preference thing."
5,Torani Coconut Syrup,It was exactly as I ordered it and was and is perfect. Will be ordering it again soon. I highly recommend it.
4,well worth a listen,"This collection of great tracks will introduce the listener to many of the modern forces in the dancehall/reggae/ragga movements. Spearheaded by excellent efforts from Bounty Killer, Beenie Man, Luciano, and Simpleton, and featuring a track from 80's legend Cocoa Tea, this lp is powerful and guaranteed to keep you going back for more."
1,Mine broke quickly! Software is terrible.,"I agree with all the other feedback saying this product is faulty. The on/off button is terrible. It takes 5 tries to turn the unit off. After 5 months of using this, the unit would no longer ""talk"" with the satellites. I sent it back to DeLorme. It tested bad. Now I have waited 6 weeks for a replacement that is backordered. Customer service rep will not refund your purchase after 30 days! The software claims it will compute driving routes for you...but it will crash your PDA instead. I had to buy INav IGuidance software (which is outstanding) to get software that will actually compute road routes for me. I would not recommend this product to anyone. It has been a complete waste of money for me."
1,On/Off,"It is the year 2005. The 21st Century. We've put men on the moon. We've launched space probes to the edges of our solar system. We can even remotely drive little vehicles along the surfaces of other planets.But we can't design a simply on/off button.The on/off button for the Blue Logger is one of the most insanely stupid things I've ever encountered. Some mentally-challenged engineer somewhere decided that you have to hold the button 2-4 seconds to turn it on, and 2-4 seconds to turn it off.It doesn't *sound* that difficult to do, but in practice it is infuriating, especially when you are trying to turn it on but end up turning it off. Right now the Blue Logger is sitting in front of me and I cannot turn it off. It simply will not turn off.Oh, and I've had lots of problems connecting it to my Bluetooth adapter, and have yet to get Street Atlas USA 2005 to recognize it."
3,Good buy,"My only problem with these batteries are the poorly made ""end-caps"" on them. One of my small knobs that rotates on the end cap to lock it in place broke, within two weeks. Thankfully, I still had the old, worn out Canon caps and I replaced the broken cap with the much stronger and durable Canon cap.No problem since then and about $70 cheaper than the Canon brand."
1,without options...,"I'm a Photojournalist in Mexico, in my work borrow me a Mk IIN but the battery who came with the camera it was too old and lose the charge too fast.I think in buy one but here in Mexico are too expensive like 200 dlls or more and it's impossible find a gereric.I order this item whit my family in usa, then they send me this to my house in mexico.i put to charge in my original canon charger and when i disconect one of the tiny tubes who came in the contact space broke's and fall, the charger not charge de battery anymore, i try to fix it whit a cuprum litle tube for make contact and doesn't worki loose my mind and broke the battery..."
3,"Crummy-but-usable fit, good capacity, better than other aftermarket NP-E3s","It fits in my 1dsII, but just barely--it takes considerable force plus some wiggling to get it in far enough to latch. My genuine Canon battery is comparatively effortless.The release handle is less sturdy than its Canon counterpart; combined with the very tight fit it feels very much like I'm going to break it off every time.But it does seem to hold a decent charge, and too tight is better than sloppy and prone to losing contact like I've seen from others.So it's still better than any other aftermarket NP-E3 I've tried.If you've got the dough, get the real thing. If not, well, this unit's shortcomings are inconveniences, not showstoppers, and completely bearable at this price. Get it and get back to shooting."
2,Caution,"I ordered two of these. One of them worked fine, lasting as long as the Canon brand. The other would not lock into the the body. I returned the dud for a full refund.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007CIWZG/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_img"
2,1 out of the 2 won't hold the charge,I bought 2 of these battery and 1 the them will only be good for 1 hour of shooting. Disappointed.
3,Lenmar DMCE3,"Bought two of these battries, one was great the second one would not hold a charge, so I had to go through the hasel of returning it to Amazon which was no problem they were great in reimburseing my account, Lenmar all so talk about the fit of the battery being tight and no gaps, it was no tight fit had a gap between the camera body and the battery. But for the price it was okay if both batteries had worked okay I would have given them four stars, the one battery I do have just keeps going, I have fired off about 800 pictures and it still says it has a full charge, so if you can live with the little gap and hope that you get a good battery I would recomend this battery"
1,It doesn't fit,"OK, so it is much cheaper and someone said you can always switch your old cover if it doesn't fit. But the problem is that the screw holes in the base are not in the right place so even switching the canon cover didn't close the gap. In other words, my nice waterproof Canon EOS 1D mkII would not be water proof even if I was willing to put up with the poor fit, hard to install battery. It is packed up and going back. I am about to order a genuine Canon battery."
5,Good aftermarket item,"This battery seems to hold a charge as long as the standard Canon battery, at a much lower cost. So far I'm very happy with it..."
3,Hit or Miss???,Like some others the battery I purchased May-1st didn't fit my MkII because of the end cap/latching mechanism. When I first bought my 1D I read somewhere to never throw out an old battery for just this reason. Luckily I had one around with a good end cap that I knew worked. Two screws later the battery was in and working fine. Now let's see how long the cells lasts.If Lenmar is anything like most other companies these days that don't actually manufacture anything themselves but just find the cheapest vendor they can to put their brand name on they need to find another vendor!
4,Good value for the money,"I bought this battery because it was substantially cheaper than the OEM battery. When the manufacturer's battery is nearly four times more expensive, it's worth the risk of buying an aftermarket battery.So far this has been a very successful choice. I have been using this with a Canon 1DMk2 and have been getting a full week's worth of use without any noticeable loss of power. I'm a photojournalist at a smaller daily paper, shooting between 3 an 5 assignments per day.The battery fits the camera without any issue and it hasn't even shown the half-used symbol after a week of shooting. With the significant cost difference between this and the manufacturer's battery, this is well worth a shot. If you're paying out of an expense account, buy the OEM battery."
5,Works Great Canon 1D Classic,"I am not a big fan of aftermarket anything but decided to try this battery. Wow...glad I did, fit and finish is superb with my 1D and I'm getting 800 shots per charge on it.Went and ordered 2 more...great product!"
1,this is awful!! do not buy!,"If you could give this bassinet 0 stars I would. I am so unhappy with it. The picture of it is very misleading. To start the lace does not go as far as it is shown in the picture and there is a warning label very large right in the front of the bassinet in orange and the lace does not cover it up either so it is the first thing you see on the bassinet. A really bad place to put the warning sign. It is sewed very well on there too, we were able to get it off thankfully. Also the music box feature with music and light and vibration is underneath the lace on the front. Which makes having the light pointless because with the light on under the lace you can not see the light even on. If this bassinet didn't cost so much for shipping and to ship it back I would send it back but it is not worth the money wasted. Please don't waste your money I can't see how anyone would be happy with this product."
3,disappointed,"A fair amount of background hiss. I bought this for the office to listen through headphones or at low volume. Unfortunately, on CD there is annoying background noise which will only go away with increased volume. The situation is even worse for the line in (minidisc in my case).I had the previous gen Sony boombox, which sounded MUCH better, but its CD player broke!"
3,"Excellent sound and great FM, but not very compact","I love the sound from this box especially because the base has three levels. That round section in the middle of the front is a subwoofer. I had expected it to be the CD player. The CD player is on the top which makes this a rather deep boom box. You're not going to heft this one on your shoulder and strut down the lane. I wanted to put it on a shelf but it turned out to be too deep. Otherwise it is great. And it has great FM reception, which has been a problem for me with other boomboxes."
2,Problems,"This was the only boom box I could find with a line-in. (I want to be able to plug in my iPod). The line-in feature has a hum/buzz that will not go away. It even hums/buzzes when nothing is plugged in.Also, there are not enough clear, crisp highs on any of the settings. The bass is muddy. This one's going back. Wouldn't recommend."
5,Can't beat it!!,"As a electronic systems engineer, I design audio systems with speakers using Bi-amp technology. This gives you more flexibility of the highs, and lows of multiple speaker boxes. I just bought one of these boxes because of that technology. I was impressed with the sound quality of this box. The remote is great, and unless you are pprimary a tape player/recorder user,(uses mechanical buttons instead of soft touch)who is still using tape anyway?? This is the best box for the money hands own. I also like the line in flexibility, it added theater quality sound to my 20&quot; television in my room."
3,saw chain,it is what it is. this oregon chain is generally accepted as an acceptable stock replacement for any chain saw.
1,Didn't fit,"Said it fit Stihl 16"" chain saw. Didn't fit mine. The guide the chain travels on was too thin for the chain to sit in. I have a Stihl MS 211C."
1,Doesn't fit as advertized,Does not fit my Stihl MS211 though it says it will. That would be an error on the manufacturer (Oregon). The seller won't take it back since I didn't open it within 30 days. (Shame on the seller).
3,Different Product Than Displayed,"Ordered chain saw chain as depicted in Oregon package and described as an L67. However, the chains I received were in a quite different Oregon package. They work well on my saw, however, the grinding wheel width required to sharpen on my Oregon chain shapener is different and the top plate angle is different. This required me to purchase a 3/16"" wide grinding wheel ($20) versus the 1/8"" required by the L67 chain pictured when ordered. If I order more chains in the future, I will insist on the item pictured. To receive something different is not acceptable."
3,Good for people like us,"All of us are hurrying everyday, and it is good that we can sit back and be happy. ""Don't Hurry, Be Happy!"" also taught us how to enjoy simple things in life, like having a longer time at the bath tub, laughing with our children, and doing silly things in the office once in a week.I'll recommend this book to all those that have not been happy for a long while because they are too busy."
3,How did I get so old??,"Bought this to use on a new to me 2011 RZR. Previous owner had removed stock exaust and put Big Gun on ... I like the look of the Big Gun, but was too loud for my liking.The Vortex did quiet it down a bit .. but not enough for my liking .. I did not see any change in performance? I've added a 90 elbow pointing exaust down toward ground and that helped more that the insert. ... however I used the insert to weld the 90 elbow to.Tractor on"
2,Waste of Money,"I am using this book for a MBA class at a Top 20 school. Our class is focused on students who have not had any formal background in statistics. This book lacks in depth explanations for its problems. Its solutions manual is marginally helpful because it also does not explain how it reaches the answers.Granted this book is mean to be used with excel, but it relies too much on Excel to do the computation. Thus the student is limited in building a strong basis in statistics.Unfortunately, my whole MBA class is going through is agony with this book."
3,Great but...,"Content great. Unfortunately, pages smelled so bad (ink or paper?) that I can't even use it in a small, enclosed space."
5,Another Classic Dub Record,"Prince Jammy (these days ""King"" Jammy, in the late King Tubby's honour) was the mixing engineer and Crucial Bunny engineer, responsible for the dub/mixing of this 1979 work of tracks played by 'The Revolutionaires' and all in the hallowed 'Channel One' studios in Kingston, Jamaica.So with these credentials in mind, it is hard to imagine this album as being anything other than heavy, classic, roots dub; which it is.Highly recommended for fans of '70s era Jamaican Reggae Dub."
3,"24"" hemostat forceps",Too heavyI bought them to take care of my fish tank. Takes a big load on your fingers and wrist. Stop using it after a while and just use my hands to remove or fix stuff in it.
4,Stairwell: Central European Experience,"This historical-fictional story throws a spotlight upon what seems so distant to most Americans, ordinary life in central Europe following the past half century. It is a fine story which keeps your attention to the end."
5,Farmers love this book,"I have only flipped through this book, but I wanted to balance the past few reviews with what I've heard from organic farmers in Northern California, who have expressed positive words that this is a Great, practical beginner resource about sustainable farming. To me, that's pretty convincing feedback."
3,Not for the average gardener..,"It doesn't need to be this hard or this complicated.If you really want to grow lots of vegetables in a small space, get ""square foot gardening"" by Mel Bartholomew. Simple, easy and productive. This is just too much work for too little return IMHO.Good luck and go out there and get your hands dirty!"
2,California Vegetarians,"I have gardened organically for over 30 years, and always love to read good gardening books hoping to learn more. Unfortunately this book is so very focused on being totally vegetarian that they do not even recommend animal manures to be used in compost. I feel that they have totally ignored the natural cycles of birth - death - decomposition - and rebirth. A quote that says it all is, ""Everything that eats is in turn eaten"". That includes plants that feed on the remains of other plants, insects, or algae and bacteria. The author overlooks the fact that there are no total vegetarians in nature. Even grazers, gorillas, and great whales ingest insects or micro-fauna along with their grass, leaves, and plankton."
1,Not what I expected ....,"I simply love Butler's ""Blues after sunset"" and his New Orleans boogie piano work. This is an attempt for him to reach a broader / younger crowd. Good grief. If you're looking for classic Butler then look elsewhere. If you're willing to work and perhaps come up empty handed then proceed."
3,Groovin CD- change of pace,"This CD was not what I expected, but didn't leave me dissapointed- Henry Butler is a talented player and composer as this CD proves-I was most impressed, however with Mac Daddy Henry- featuring the incredible Shane Theriot on guitar- (although the credits say otherwise- the sound is undeniably Shane on this track- I know his sound well)-Henry constantly goes for different sounds, feels and tunes and this CD should be a welcome change for fans of his-"
1,STAY AWAY!!!!! BAD STAND!!!!,Who ever made this thing must hate X-MAS. 1. This thing leaks!! 2. It's so hard to screw in the bolts you need a hand tool. 3. Leveling a tree is an evening event. 4. If you need more resons not to buy this... then buy it and post what you hate about it here too.
1,Stay away,This stand doesn't hold right 6ft tree. I am not sure what's wrong with this design but even with 4 screws it is impossible to secure the tree. My tree tipped over twice and came crashing down to the ground where it broke most of the ornaments.
2,An album I can't get tired of!,"Great album all the way through-like good country music, it is soulful, introspective even, but keeps a steady pace and rich texture. I have listened to it almost every day for several months and am not tired of it yet. I can't say that many other albums have survived 100 listens as far as I am concerned.I came rather warily to this album; for many years, all I ever heard of ""Irish music"" was either the folk stuff with tin whistle, fiddle, harp, and pipes; or the old-school tenors ala John McCormick and Morton Downey Sr; or else the sleep-inducing New Agey stuff ala Enya. But Mary Black, with The Pogues and a few others, is opening up a new horizon in world music for me. I expect this album to survive another 100 listens and keep going strong."
4,It is good but...,"I am a real big fan of the show and like tring to figure who did it. The only problme I have with THIS DVD is that starts with ep.s 68,69,&73, what happen to the other ep.s. Ep.s 70-72 is a three part ep. my question is why did they (people who put the DVD together)skip over that case? There is about 200+ ep.s to this show and I would like to have all of them, so again why was that ep. skipped over."
5,Great Stir Fry Pan,I think this is one of better quality pans around for the price If you like to cook chinese stir fry its the right pan for the job.
4,Good Enough To Read !,"I did not read Gingerbread, but Shrimp is a very good book. It is about this girl named Cyd Charisse and she is in her last year of high school and it just explains her relationship with her boyfriend Shrimp and new friendships with really unique friends. I especially like this book because I think it is well written and any teenager who reads it will relate to it. She describes the problems she has as she decides what she will do with the rest of her life. I would like to read a sequel to this book that tells how her life is going in college and to see if she finds a boy like shrimp. I definitely recommend this book for ages 15 and up."
3,Wrong one,I wanted the shrimp book with the new cover so it could go with my collection. But instead I got the old cover. I still like the book but I wanted that one.
4,Cyd and company,"I loved this book. I loved the realistic twist and the funny humor. (This book has some great one-liners!) The characters are what really pulled me in. The are so funny, cool, and I just wanted to get to know them even more then the author, Rachel Cohn, would let me.Overall, this book is about a senior in high school, once again getting to know her boyfriend, Shrimp. Yes, she has a past with being pregnant with hottie Justin's baby. Cyd is just someone trying to find her way before she leaves high school, not to her dismay, and have a life with her boyfriend or maybe not. :) She learns what happens when she makes bad and good choices. Cyd is just a girl, like you and me, being in love and not really knowing how to deal with it.I give Rachel Cohn a big hug because this book rocked!! This was almost as good as the Gingerbread, Shrimp's sequel!"
3,Shrimp,"I was a big fan of Gingerbread, and the thing that I liked most about it was its substance. However, Shrimp was lacking that particular feature. I did not like how Cyd Charisse seemed to change her mind about things every chapter, and I think that Autumn and Helen could have been better defined as characters. I think that the ending was just an excuse to write another book in the series. Also, some of the ""slang terms"" were a little out-dated. All in all, I don't think this book lived up to its potential, but it was not the worst thing I have ever read."
3,Fishy,I am not that into these kind of teenage stories but when I picked up Gingerbread and loved that I thought this would be as good or better. But It was dissapointing and a let down. I think that it was too longwinded and not very welll written.
4,"Very utilitarian, works as advertise, quality of metal, cuttings not as refined.","Very pratical! This is a good lighter, wind-resistant-not proof, however, the metal quality, cutting/finish/polish/grind is of a lower standard compared to that of a Zippo. Seems as is made from a stamped steel/tin alloy, easily bendable in areas and can corrode if not protected from elements. Some thin edges are sharp enough to cut if not careful. I like the feature of removable bottom, which acts as a candle, a plus. Press/flip switch sometimes awkward to press; slips at times with greasy/wet finger. Simple adjustable wind screen, I like. Mechanism for the flint/flint-lock/springs are designed very well! Robust build, but can be improved for beefiness. Lights 95% of the time."
4,a differant lighter,"the price of 8 dollars was very inexpensive for a lighter so i didn't really exspect to much. i read the reviews and most seemed to like the lighter. i have colleced lighteer for years, from surf board lighters to world war 1 trench lighters. this lighter is differant then any other one i have, the side flips up for the flint to go into and the flame pulls out on the bottom to light a candle or cigar. i wish they had raised the price even by 10 dollars and made it out of a silver, copper, or any stronger metal rather then tin. it has the feel of a flimsy lighter but it has not broken even after neing dropped and used a lot. this lighter is worth the money and i would buy another if i ever lost this one. it wa shipped on time and with no problem buy it without any worries."
3,Not A Pipe lighter,"I purchased this lighter to use primarily for pipe smoking and secondly for around the camp fire. I have not been able to test it for camping, however, this pipe is not a pipe lighter.While metal, of an aluminum or tin type of material, it can easily be bent, so put it somewhere safe.While theoretically the removable insert allows you to light a pipe, this is a tricky and hot task to perform. I went ahead and bought a Zippo pipe lighter instead and not only received an instrument which is more durable, but easier to use and more reliable. As well, the Zippo is a true pipe lighter. Spend the extra $4 and get the Zippo pipe lighter."
4,Way Over Priced! Decent Lighter.,"I've had many of these.. used to sell them at gunshows. A good lighter, but not the best. However, you can get these 2 for $14 if you look around. $24 each is a major rip-off!"
2,Not a butane lighter. Not sure what is windproof about it,"This is just a regular lighter. It takes lighter fluid. It was a waste of money. I bought it because I thought ""windproof"" meant a butane torch lighter. I was wrong. Save your money, get something else."
1,disappointed,"Right out of the box, the product does not work. I took a chance on this lighter and I am sorry I did. Its nice that sparks come out when I hit the ignition but no fire. It means either this product was shipped broken or came with no fuel to begin with. Either way, this is not how a lighter should be shipped to a customer. I did not bother to ship it back as my time is worth money and for me to pay for shipping for a $12 lighter is not worth it. Besides how it looks, this lighter does deliver what it promises. At least the lighter should come filled with fuel or not broken. Don't fall for the slick looks. I am bit suspicious that maybe all the past rave reviews are posted by the employees of the seller."
5,"Good lighter, NOT windproof","IMCO is a great lighter. A little bit complex than Zippo, but more trustworthy (at least it doesn't evaporate fuel like mad).The only complain about description is that it has nothing to do with windproof. It doesn't keep light better than cheap Chinese lighters while the wind is blowing.Overall it's a great purchase."
2,mediocre at best,This is simply not a very good lighter. Bought one for myself and my brother in law and we both have moved on to a zippo. For a couple dollars more just get a zippo.
1,Does not do it,I purchased this lighter because I believed it would light in the wind as advertised. IT DOES NOT! A light wind blows it out. So I would not buy this lighter again.
1,all around not worth it,"first thing you notice is it smaller then it looked in picture. next wasnt that practical got very hot if lit for over 10 sec and moving peices got jammed easly. in my opinion just get a zippo, heck a disposable bic is better than this."
3,No package or instructions,"Was disappointed that the lighter didn't come in a package or include any basic instructions, like requiring lighter fluid instead of butane (which I bought instead) or that you could use it as a candle, but again, no instructions. Made out of light tin that could dent easily, definitely has one heck of a spark. Old school style and make."
2,MEH,"This is an inexpensive lighter, and cheaply made, I think I would have preferred a Zippo. IT works but, MEH!"
2,Lighter without the fluid?,"It is an okay item but at the same time I had one big problem. I hear others saying something about fluid, and when I got mine I had constantly kept lighting it, all i did with the wick was just catch red, it never stayed as lit as near as close as the shown picture. It just came with the metal part, the flint, and the cotton thing to keep it lit. I didn't get any liquid in mine or fuel, I would at least have expected it to. And if it does it should at least say ""Product does not come with fluid"".I don't know where to get the cotton after taking it all out since the cotton it came with, after constantly trying to get it lit, had ran out. That is my current and possibly only reason for 2 stars."
1,Buy elsewhere,"I purchased this lighter to replace the IMCO lighter that I lost. IMCO makes great lighters and I loved my old one, however, the one I received from this distributor was not acceptable.The lighter was shipped in a small brown envelope that was not even properly sealed. The package was labeled ""Austrian Windproof Lighter New"" which seemed sketchy to me. My suspicions were correct when I looked at the lighter and realized it is not the lighter advertised or the original IMCO Triplex. The lighter I was shipped has five raised stars down the side, not what I had ordered.I will be returning this item immediately and purchasing elsewhere."
5,"Absorbing, Amazing, Awe Inspiring","Robert Vivian has taken the personal essay to new heights, expanding poetic language into a deeply inspirational journey into the human experience. If ever you believed the essay genre to be dull and pedantic, Vivian will change your mind forever with his gorgeous language and important insights. The essay is boring no longer"
5,A Golden State of Mind,"A rolicking good read. Full of witty humor and surprising plot twists. Evokes the wacky and turbulent '60's at America's greatest public University on the eve of the Free Speech Movement. I've given copies to numerous friends, and they all loved it too!"
5,"Doc Martin, Season 4",Excellent series. Esy to download. Enjoyable and hard to stop at one episode as a marathon watch is great. The characters draw you in and are consistent from one episode to the next. They make you want to know them better.
3,Doc Moartin movies,"I am a fan of the Doc Martin British tv series so thought I'd take a look at these movies. The entire premise of the movies is different so not as good as the tv show, but ok to watch."
5,Addictive entertainment!,"Absolutely, top notch entertainment. My husband and I have gotten addicted to Doc Martin and can't wait until the next season starts!"
4,Doc Martin really pulled me in,"My husband and I got very caught up in the story of Doc Martin's little village. There were crazy characters, and moving characters. We always wanted to know what was coming next."
5,Doc Martin: Series 4,"I love the entire cast, especially the pairing of Martin & Louisa and love their accents. Louisa calls herself ""Louiser"" and so does Police Officer Penhale. Love it! The exchange between Louisa/Martin almost certainly makes me feel like they'll never make it, yet somehow this unusual couple come through and I'm not sure what makes them tick. Much humor and fun to watch. Love the fact that there's no violence, sex, or fowl language. Will always be missing Stephanie Cole. What a great character she played in the series."
4,Fun characters,Fun characters! Some of the medical cases seem a little too odd rather than the more routine. Of course it is a movie! I loved making a gastric tube out of what??Louisa is very well played.
5,Great Series,"I have really enjoyed this unique TV series, watching on my Kindle Fire HD. Love the village setting and all the characters."
5,Doc Martin is the kind of doctor i would love to have,"Doc Martin is the kind of doctor I wouldn't mind having as a doctor, he tells you like it is doesn't beat around the bus. He is very very funny."
5,Brilliant,I have watched the entire series and loved every minute of it! The characters are rich and well played. The acting is suberb... He somewhat reminds me of the Brittish equivalent of House.... grumpy but you come to love him!
4,Last season of Doc?,"Having seen all of season 1 and 2 on PBS, I just had to see the rest. Doc Martin did not disappoint, but I wish his character had grown beyond being just a doctor. Maybe the new episodes filming in 2011 will allow him to grow, but then that might not make for the silliness we have become used to in British comedy."
4,Great food!,"This version is ground. NOt my current cat's favorite version, but he really likes the taste. I do wish they'd make this one not ground but in the pieces variety too. My previous cat really liked this one and usually licked the bowl clean. But, neither wanted it more than once or twice a month. Why, I don't know but it seems to be a little richer than the others."
4,Very informative and comprehensive.,"This has to be one of my favorite books because it covers a lot of hard to find information about some of the world's most famous, amazing and exotic munitions. It did miss some of the classics, but over all it was great. It was worth every cent and I STRONGLY recomend this book. Ian V. Hog did a lot of reaserch on this one and it realy shows up when you read it. Because of this book, I am going to check out some other books by Ian V.Hog."
1,Not an actual Cisco part.,"I spoke to customer service about these. Despite what the description seems to say, these are ""Cisco-compatible"" NOT actual Cisco parts. They should probably fix the title AND drop the ""by Cisco"" in the description so they don't mislead anyone else. I'm sure they probably work just fine and I will revise my review if they correct the description of this item."
4,Sweet Memories,"I purchased this CD the day I heard that Shearing had passed. It was a bitter sweet moment as George Shearing was the one who inspired me to be a fan of Jazz more than 50 years ago. I had purchased the albums on this CD way back when. Shearing was also a great influence on one of my favorite pianists, the late Jack Wilson. The Shearing sound is still as melliflous as ever. But time has advanced music as everything else so although I enjoy his sound, the recording and music dynamics have changed greatly over the years so that this music is now not as complex or as driving as today's jazz,be that the smooth variety or the more traditional style.That being said, George is George and as such there will always be a place for him in any jazz collection."
2,Cool Cayenne still hot,"I don't understand; I tried the cool cayenne, and it was still hot hot hot in my stomach.Has anyone else experienced the same thing?I read somewhere that if your mouth experiences the hotness first, it somewhat prepares your stomach for the cayenne. I just swallowed the capsules because I didn't want the hot burning in my mouth."
4,Simple and Fast Game,This is a simple and quick game that is great for two people with a few minutes to spare. The concept is easy enough for kids and the equipment is durable. I would recommend this game for a parent and child or two equal-minded individuals looking to waste a few minutes.
4,Superb collection,"As Keith Allen Daniels says in his introduction ""most of these sonnets have a past life"" but this reviewer found them all fresh and new and worth more than one visit. These three poets are clearly masters of this poetic form--which lends itself well to the diverse themes of horror and dark fantasy as envisioned by the individual authors.But it is the distinctive storytelling of Ann K. Schwader that truly shines in ""Pages from a Paperback Imagination"". Her technique of overlaying contemporary heroes (Avalon, Avalon, Do You Read?) with the stuff of myth and legend is unique. The 14 lines of ""Dead Girls Don't Cry"" are filled with an in-depth characterization this reviewer usually only finds in novels -- and her monsters (Poraymos/The Devouring) are too real to ever be forgotten.Powerful poetry here. Highly recommended."
1,Unlistenable,I loved Hamish Moore's Steppin' on the Bridge. But whohad the bright idea that bagpipes and trombones and saxophones mix???? They mix like oil and water...After listening to thisI threw away the CD and used the jewel case to replace anotherthat was cracked. Yuk! If you want a great smallpipe CD checkout Steppin' on the Bridge...pass this dog by.
5,"Gran libro, un clásico. De un personaje ambiguo.","Aunque Eric Gill es un personaje de grandes claroscuros, su trabajo como artista es impresionante. Este libro no solo toca el tema tipográfico, sino sus ideas del arte y la relación con la industria de su época.Es un poco difícil separar los grandes ideales que escribe y la realidad de su vida, en algunos momentos suena falso y vacío.Aun así es un gran libro, un clásico de la tipografía. Escrito por alguien que no logró integrar en su vida lo que decía y lo que hacia."
4,It's cool,"Scooby doo is awesome! Go back in time, and prepare to have a great time with Scooby and his pals!"
4,"Groovy, Scooby, groovy!!!","A real treat to finally hear all of those Danny Janssen classics in their entirety. Plus, Jimmy Reed's ""Pretty Mary Sunlite"" is worth the cost of the whole cd. I've been singin' that damn tune since I was 6. The early songs are much better than the later Scoob tunes. Although, ""Scooby's Mystery Mix"" is pretty incredible - matching a vocal collage from the cartoon with electronic/rave music. A must have for any true Scooby fan."
5,The Cd to remember,"This Cd is the best. It brings back all the memories of watching the show as a kid. I played it at work and people continually commented happily about it. It brought many memories back for many people. Thank you Rhino for letting me beable to listen to the music from my favorite show when I'm unable to watch the show itself. I recently moved and do not have cable any more so now I've started making a collection of all the videos that are still available and this made my collection even better. Anyone who liked Scooby would love this Cd it has all the theme songs from the different series and many songs from the show. Of course it doesn't have all the songs, but that would take many Cd's. For this Cd though I think they picked the ones most people would remember and the best ones. Can't wait for more Scooby stuff to come out."
2,"If you are looking for Scooby Doo music, keep looking.",This is not at all what I expected. We bought this for Scooby party for my son's 5th birthday and were very disapointed. There are very few songs that I have ever heard on Scooby. I would not recommend this CD.
4,Great for fans of the show! Fans will love it!,This cd is a must for fans of the TV series! There's lots of sons from the serioes too! i love this cd because all the songs I remember hearing on the show are on this cd! This cd is great for fans of the show(and who grew up watching the original Scooby Doo! ) The fans will love this cd ! Plus I like the way the cd is set! This cd is must for anyone who wants to go back to their childhood!
2,Waste of a rental,"Having just seen Ratt in concert, I was interested in seeing Stephen Pearcy's ""acting debut"" in Camp Utopia. He's fine unfortunately this is a real waste of a rental due to the poor dialoge, bad acting, low quality film. This movie is the epitome of low budget in every respect."
1,Had it for a week and it broke,Followed instructions.. after a week the machine did not grind any longer and could not turn the dial adjustment. Returned to Amazon with no issues. I have had a Gaggia gringer for 16 years and boight the Rocky to match my silvia 3. Needless to say my gaggia is my go to and grinds perfect!!!
5,no comparison,Prior to purchasing my ROCKY Grinder I used a Kitchen Aid Grinder with a limited number of fine grind settings. I could never get the specific espresso taste desired. With the ROCKY Grinder settings are almost unlimited. The quality of my espresso drinks is now on par with any cup of espresso available commercially. Actually better according to the wife and who wants to argue with that testimony. This machine is the ultimate coffee grinder and is a top quality product. I am completely satisfied and there simply is no comparison.
5,Markus Makes It Happen,"Markus Schulz is one of the best, but least known, Trance DJs in the world. This production by Schulz does not fail to disappoint. He captures what Ibiza is and what one imagines it to be."
3,Ibiza 06 - weaker than previous Ibiza,I was a bit disappointed by this CD. It is more mellow than the previous Ibiza CD considering it is supposed to be a techno-dance CD. It is still a decent effort and should not be discounted if you like techno.
2,Only if u like soft or mellow choons,"i purchased this album hopin to hear markus' gdjb style but ended up almost listenin 2 the sounds of the ocean. now dont get me wrong, the sounds of the ocean is great 2 relax the mind, but I was expectin more energy from this album. ne ways, if ur more into ambient trance, this may b a good album 4 ya. great flow, some great tracks (mellow wise) but just way 2 mellow 4 me."
3,Not as applicable as it seems,"If you are truly planning on pursuing the study of Tibetan medicine as a vocation, this book is for you. If you are hoping to glean a few practical tidbits to apply toward a healthy life, it is possible...however, few is the key word. Chapter 11 was the most informative chapter in the book, talking about behavior. It's a great book explaining Tibetan medicine, not applying it."
4,Exceptionally short review.,"Garth Ennis, Preacher: Until the End of the World (DC Comics, 1997)Ennis' landmark series continues with its second installment, in which questions get answered, more enemies pop up, and, not surprisingly, lots of stuff blows up. We get a good deal of insight into Jesse's character, which is all well and good, and meet a bunch of new bad guys (and Jesse's family are the least of the lot, to be sure). If you've already read Gone to Texas, this is a must; if not, do so at your earliest convenience. Preacher is good readin'."
4,bought as a gift,I had read the series before I did like it. bought the set for a good friend who also really liked the series.
5,"It really is ""more fun than going to the movies.""","That high praise came from CLERKS director Kevin Smith. He is dead on about PREACHER, especially this, the second collection, which introduces Jesse's severely dysfunctional family and Herr Starr, the series' main villain. The 2 best moments here: the Preacher's fight with Jody, the sadistic farmhand who killed his father, and the orgy/party thrown by Jesus deSade, who must be read to be believed."
4,As advertised,Looks good and seems to work well - can not find these in stores so I was glad to find one here
1,JUNK,bought mine at a auto store it lasted about a year before the bag itself started tearing. stay away. do not buy.
2,Impractical,"I found it impractical; it would fold into itself too easily. I liked that there were bags included, but they were very flimsy. You're better off buying these at the grocery store. Returned."
5,Blaxuede lyrics are smooth as suede,"The cd is great....every song on there bustingI can see awards in the making for ""Da Sheetz"" and ""The Only Lady"" fa sho. ""Feel it Coming"" and ""About the Paper"" great messages there....And the hot single ""Bring da Pain"" great bounce.All of the songs were the bomb. The Skit was new and original it shows that Blaxuede is a very versatile entertainer. Actor/ Rapper....sounds familiar..hint..hint...Blaxuede,you've got a winner here. If you miss it, you've missed it. This was 15.00 that was well spent. As it was quoted in the November issue of Grooveline Magazine..""For the first time in history DARKNESS will SHINE."""
5,WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?,"Where has this guy been. Tight lyrics, tight tracks, and he actually makes sense. You don't usually find artist like that, Blaxuede is definately an original. Plus his voice is a Classic. You must hear the c.d to know what I mean....."
2,Tragically flawed,"What's your data worth? If it's not much you probably don't need to carry it with you. If it's actually valuable, then this drive is not for you.I had the 512 MB version of this drive and loved it for the first couple of months. Then the problems surfaced. The housing and keyring attachment on this drive are so flimsy you'll get maybe 3 months use before it falls apart. If you're lucky you'll notice as soon as it happens. If not, you'll just notice that the drive has fallen out of the housing somewhere, or else the housing has separated from your keychain.I'd recommend getting something more solid."
4,For Modern talking-fans,"Okay,this album includes some good songs,and you will adore this album...if you're a Modern Talking-fan.Some of the songs have a too 80's-style for me,and the male rapping that appears in some of the songs doesn't work out so good.But beside of that,it's worth buying if you like that kind of music.In fact,there's many good tracks on this album..."
3,"I found this guide useful, but ...","I used this book in Peru & Bolivia in August 1998, and it was useful, but there are better guides around, at least for Peru. I give it only three stars because it is unnecessarily large and inconvenient as a use-on-the-trail guide; the maps aren't very comprehensive; and the incidental information on flora, fauna, etc, is superficial."
4,Thorough and informative book for the South American trekker,"I found 'Backpacking and Trekking...' a worthwhile read. I've spent six years running tours into the Andes and this latest edition offered me some good tips on some great hikes. Like any guide of its kind some of the information is no longer accurate, but the Bolivia section was particularly useful, since it is the area I know least."
4,Good Technical Understanding,"What I like most about this book is how it explains the underlying data structures and stored procedures that are used to develop Commerce Server 2002. I appreciate the fact that they go through each aspect of Commerce Server 2002 and explains it in enough detail that a good developer can further extend.Probably, the only thing that I would have added to this book is a section on doing development within C2K2 with large teams. This section would talk about the relative difficulties of large team development with C2K2.A second edition to this book would be a complete site using C2K2 with the type of extensions that most development teams will have to make.The next edition could be something like ""C2K2 by Example"" or ""The C2K2 Cookbook""."
2,This book lacks depth,"This book was a nice overview of the product and its general capabilities. It lacks the depth in real world examples and particularly in the sample code area. Many times it is mentioned that the solution sites provided by Microsoft are not good designs for production, highly scaleable stores, yet most of the actual code samples are stripped straight from the solution site code. It would have been nice to see the author(s) invest some effort in writing some code themselves and showing alternatives to the methods Microsoft has already shown us. If you are looking for a book to help you build sites using Commerce Server 2002, skip this one."
4,"Reba, that rare breed for today. A sitcom that is actually funny.","""Reba"" debuted on the WB in the fall of 2001 and was the WB's number 1 sitcom for five years. We all knew that Reba McEntire was a talented singer and she had done some acting before, but who knew she could carry a sitcom. And be good at it. Unlike some other sitcoms that are on the air, ex. ""According to Jim"" and ""Still Standing"", ""Reba"" is actually funny. The cast is excellent and the writing is superb. I don't know why Reba McEntire hasn't been nominated for an Emmy.Season 4 aired during the 2004-2005 season with 22 episodes. Unlike seasons 1-3, season 4 does not have any special features on it. That is why I gave it 4 stars. The other sets have cast commentaries on certain episodes and featurettes. Other than that, this is an excellent dvd set. You will be happy with this one."
5,good dvd,"love reba, so glad i got it, its in really good shape, and good price, ill enjoy it for a long time thank you"
3,Reba rocks - - DVD's do not.,"I love this show. It is one of the only 2 sitcoms on television that I can actually watch.This DVD set however, was a big dissappointment.The packaging is smaller than the sets for the first 3 seasons (which totally ruins the prettiness of my shelf), and there are NO extras on this set at all. . . . which was really annoying.Worth the purchase if you're a huge fan of the show though. This is quality television =)"
3,reba series,"I really dont know about this product being I bought it for a gift,,I know it came in perfect condition,,and I am happy for the Amazon website being so great!"
2,Great Series BUT Will They Ever Release the Rest?,"We like this series but the problem is the same one that other series on DVD have run into. They quit releasing the later seasons if sales are what they consider too low. If sales are low at least put out the episodes with no extras to finish. Season four has been out a long, long time. Where is season five? Will it ever come? Not holding my breath."
4,Missing special features,I love this show and am so happy that I could finally order season 5 and hopefully soon season 6. The only thing keeping this from getting all five stars is the lack of any special features. I loved listening to the comentaries on the other seasons
1,Worked great...for a couple weeks,Then it started giving wildly inaccurate readings and shutting off randomly during use. Don't buy it!
1,Anne,"Have had the 2610 for less than a year with no problems, then the paper jammed. I replaced the cartridges, talked to the foreign web support, did everything I knew to do before taking it in for repair. Well, they can't repair it because they say they don't have the ""parts"" and want to sell me a cheaper refurbished all-in-one. I am thoroughly disgusted. Why can't they repair it? I don't want a cheaper refurbished printer that I can buy online new for less than what they are asking for the refurbished one they are offering me. I am really disappointed with HP."
3,Poor interface with Powerbook G4,"I give it 5 stars for performance and only 2 stars for interface capability with my Powerbook G4, particularly Word for Mac. If you are a Mac user look elsewhere."
2,Problems,"I have no complaints about the print quality, speed or software. My main complaint is that the paper will not feed properly. I think it's problem may be in the inherent technological deficiency in ""sniffer"" paper feeders, which this one is. I have an old Epson Stylus which is a ""feeder"" type tray with the paper in the back rather than under the printer and it works like a charm. I have tried less paper, more paper in the tray. I have tried adjusting the guides and the paper in tiny steps a hundred different ways and the printer still will not feed the paper properly. I have to babysit every print job, feeding individual sheets into the printer. If it is allowed more than one page in the tray it will invariably pull in three sheets then give me a paper jam error message. Overall it's printing performance has been good and the ink cartridges last a long time. But I would not recommend this printer."
5,For an all in one this is a good machine,It gets the job done. For day to day use it's fast and out prints many others I know of and is one of the fastest ink jets I have seen especially for text. It has convenient feature too with the built in card readers and such.The scan quality leaves a little to be desired sometimes but for most stuff it is more than good enough.I recommend this to anyone looking for an in home bang for their buck all in one.
3,HP can we get some decent software?,"I have no complaints about the hardware. The most important part, the print quality is quite impressive.The software, on the other hand, is a different story. I have Windows XP Service Pack 2 and the HP software has been a nightmare. I have twice uninstalled and reinstalled the software because it caused Windows Explorer to take about 45 seconds to open. Reinstalling the software works for a while and then when the HP software updates itself over the internet, things get bad again.Lest you think this user error, I'm a software engineer and my computer is a late model with 1.2 GB of RAM. I cannot recommend this product because the software is huge and buggy and the self-updates make the problem worse.This is a huge disappoitment after my troublefree experience with the HP LaserJet 1012 monochrome laser printer and its clean bug-free software."
1,(WATCHOUT) HP Soft ware sucks,"Never had a computer printer with so many software problems. My 30 days to return are almost up so I gotta get moving. Many of my other programs don't even work any more like paint shop pro and I get a dozen errors popping up.Spoke with HP Rep barely could understand his english God help Malaysian made products bring em back to America!!!After speaking with rep he talked me into holding onto it for one more day and downloading the latest drivers and software from HP. I Have road runner, Fast cable, its gonna take me 10 hours. They trying to save money by cutting there download speed by a third of everyone else??? My epson may have fried itself out after 3 years but at least it worked. HP please don't release hardware without proper software!!! If this don't work I'm gonna try Lexmark and read my Amazon reviews more often."
2,Major problems with software,"I just bought the Photosmart 2610xi and I have had 2 days worth of headaches trying to get the software installed. I've received one fatal error after another only to be told how to correct it by an HP technician THEN only to have MORE errors pop up. After spending an hour and a half on the phone w/ a technician again today and downloading updates, I was told to expect to spend another FOUR TO FIVE HOURS on the phone with a technician to install all of the downloads. I'm sorry, but I don't have time for this....HP you need to figure out how computers work b/c mine is a basic Dell. I am not sure that I'll ever buy HP again b/c of the software."
4,Happy to find this printer,"I bought the HP PhotoSmart 2610 All-in-One Printer to replace one that was 9 years old. Hewlett Packard has made some improvements to it since then. I love the printer. The only problem I encountered was the installation disc that came with the printer did not have instructions for Windows 7. MacIntosh and Windows Vista were the only choices. After several attempts to install it, I went to the HP website and found instructions for installing it using Windows 7.It is faster and much quieter than my old one."
4,2610xi is a good all-in-one unit,"Prints fast. Scans fast. Copies fast. Output is pretty decent. Photo scanning with both color and black & white is less than perfect. Hooks up directly to local network. Network software install is a big job especially when you're dealing with several systems having different OS's. I was a bit surprised HP would release the s/w with a major bug that slowed everything down, but HP's posted patch (which currently isn't included in their updates) resolves the problem. One thing I discovered which is nice is that when you hook up the unit to a phone line, you can fax right from any system (e.g. wireless) on the network much the same as if that system is connected to a modem."
1,DISMAL.,"Last fall I made the unfortunate mistake of purchasing this all-in-one unit. The software and hardware installation were not problematic, but the performance of the printer itself is absolutely abysmal. Over my network connection, it takes over five hours to transmit a simple 2-page Word document. I've triple-checked all network conditions, requirements and connectivity, with no change in performance.You'd think that connecting directly via the supplied ethernet cable would fix the problem. Alas, no. The direct cable connection yielded AN HOUR to print a two-page text-only Word document. Unbelievable.HP, this is the last product I buy from you, which is saying something given just how much equipment you produce. My 7-year-old Epson Stylus can take down your HP 2610 any day."
1,Don't buy this printer,"As other reviewers have noted, the print quality is good, but the reliability is very poor. It took forever to install the software successfully, was very difficult to get network printing working. Now that it is about 3 years old, it requires frequent resets and the scanner has recently failed. I won't buy another HP."
2,SHOULD HAVE STUCK WITH AN EPSON!,"Purchased from Apple store and wouldn't recommend. Can't get fax function to work automatically because of answering machine and therefore still have to switch on and off to receive faxes. Scanning ability is not user friendly as far as switching quality of scan and then editing image. Copy function is fine for 1 page. Sound's harsh I know and it prints fine, just so many better/more user friendly options out there."
4,great All in One,Hey guys! I just bought this 2610 and it works very well scanning is a little slow. I had no problems with the software you just stick the CD in and connect online and it will update itself. I had know Idea my tech was foriegn he had me fooled. I tested the fax and It spit out a hard copy reply in maybe 4 minutes If you don't uninstall your old printer you may get an automatic start up icon by the clock that says remove hardware with the only option being the 2610. I removed my old printing software and it went away. I give it a four. It is a space saver too about six or seven inches lower that the 7210. I don't know how much ink it will soak up yet. All I can say is lexmark is a guzzler and I wanted to try the HP.
1,HELP!,"I have had nothing but problems with this printer, particularly with the networking feature. When it works, it's great to be able to print from the laptop. I'll emphasize 'when it works.' Most of the time, the printer indicates it's connected but the networked features, such as downloading photos, don't actually work."
1,HP SOFTWARE IS AWEFUL,"HP Software is the worst I have ever dealt with. I will never buy another HP product, nor should you.I've uninstalled and re-installed this printer so many times. I'm 2 more installs from throwing it out the window."
2,Worst purchase I ever made,The print quality is great - the software from HP is...is...is.. I can't even think of the right word. I have to reinstall the software every other month. Sometimes it prints sometimes it doesn't. It constantly errors for some reason or another. I find myself on the HP troubleshooting section more than I check my e-mail. I would recommend a pass on this printer. Unless you like troubleshooting.
3,lasted less than a year,"I bought this printer in June of last year and unfortunately once when I was printing, the paper jammed and ever since then I have not been able to print with this machine even after clearing the jam and installing new cartridges. The scanner and fax still works. But I would think that for the price, they could have made something more sturdy and paper jam proof."
4,Great features in a small package,"This is the first ""All in One"" I've purchased, and I'm very pleased so far.It was easy to set up, and I've had no software problems (Mac user).The strealined, compact overall size is a plus, copy speeds excellent, photo colorstrue and crisp (especially with proper photo paper). The flip-up read-outwindow is a nice and useful touch. Excellent overall for under $300."
1,STAY AWAY,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!I have had this Printer/Scanner/Copier a little over 3 years. Eventually it started having problems starting up, making a crunching sound before failing to boot up. At first the problem would occur off and on, but now it never starts up. I did some searching online and as it turns out most other users have the same problem with no solution in sight (look it up yourself if you have any doubts).This is obviously a defective product that HP needs to recall and replace for all its owners. Unfortunately they don't seem to recognize this problem.Stay away from all HP all in one products, especially this one. There must be better models elsewhere."
5,Love this Sharpener!,"I have had an Edge maker knife sharpener for years. You don't have to change any blades, just turn the rods when they get well used. I recently lost mine and was devastated. So I ordered another one and am very, very happy. Thanks for having this available."
5,This is for everyone who thinks they know all about sex.,"Ms Hollander tells all in this book. If you think you know all there is to know about enjoying sex, you should read this book. Women will learn how to make their men and themselves happier and men will learn what they've only dreamed they've been missing. Even if you're not interested in better sex, this book is witty and will give you a chuckle."
2,Don't like,The 1st couple of chapters were interesting but it turned into be a bore very quick. Once I was 1/2 way through I couldn't wait to be finished with it since the lost of interest turned sour. I wouldn't recommend getting this book. It's very outdated and sounds totally unbelievable.
5,Great Purchase on many levels,"1) The saw is fantastic.....it is everything you expect out of Dewalt. With everything in life you get what you pay for. Couldnt be happier.2) Amazons deal on this saw with all the promotions applied made this one of the best purchases I have made in quite awhile. For the price I would have paid at the large national chain I recieved the saw,optional laser guide,Freud blade and a Dewalt recipricating saw AND the saws were at my house in 3 days......please. If you arent shopping on this site you arent paying attention.3) Also by using spare change lying around the house I was able to cash them in for free at the local Coinstar by selecting the Amazon option....it was like a rebate in itself."
5,Solid & Accurate,"This is a very solid and accurate performing miter saw. Well made, plenty of power, and relatively lightweight and easy to transport. The stock blade was much better than expected, and I used it to install 450 sq ft of engineered flooring with virtually no tearout. Dust collection, as with every miter saw I've used, is non-existant. If you find this saw on sale or with a promotional offer, as I did, don't hesitate to make the purchase. This is one of, if not the best, non-sliders on the market."
4,Nice and simple,"This would have received 5 stars instead of 4, but it doesn't have a laser guide light; otherwise, it's ready to use right out of the box and works great."
4,Good So Far,"So far so good. The machined faces are poorly faced, but flat. Also found it for 50 less while shopping in my local hardware store today."
1,Incompatible with LED,"I wish I had read the other reviews first as other people note the same problem. It would seem Dewalt updated the DW715 miter saw and failed to mention they removed hardware that made it compatible with their DW715 product line, but of course left the model intact and unscathed. This, if anything, is false advertising as you cannot couple this device with the handy dandy LED system which is specifically why I ordered this affordable saw.Infuriating to wait for the post-Christmas gift to myself and discover I have to package this heavy item up and ship it back. I'm returning the saw blades, LED system, and Dewalt miter saw all in one go. Why buy products that work together if the main piece of hardware is not going to cut it?"
4,Excellent saw,"Just wanted to echo the same comments that have been made. The new version of this saw will NOT support the LED or Light system that DeWalt sells. Went to a local store and they happened to have the new version and old version on display. It's very clear why the new version won't fit the accessories. The area in between the saw and the plastic covering is essentially nothing on the new version. They happened to have the old one in stock (it had a sticker on it dated July/2012) so I grabbed it.The saw itself is a great saw, as mentioned in other reviews."
4,Jessica The Odd One,Jessica's so weird!She is so fed up with her brother Steven(when he draws cross eyes on Johnny Buck its the last straw)that she decides to make a voodoo doll of him.
1,This totally sucks rotten eggs!!!,"This cd is one of the worst cd ever produced. It should win the ""worst cd award"" !!!! Pitiful, useless, waste of time!!!"
2,Terrible periodic static,"These headphones have an automatic sleep feature that make the receiver produce ear piercing static if it hasn't gotten a signal in 5 minutes. For me this is a huge deal breaker because I use them on my computer for voice communication in which there can be long periods without a person talking. I'm really starting to regret my purchase. Now, the overall quality of the sound and signal are fine. If you use them to listen to music or for watching TV or any other function where they are in constant use then you may not ever encounter this grating cacophony. I'd say other than this horrible ""feature"" they actually deserve about a three or four star rating but for what I use them for they are incredibly frustrating to deal with. I will not be making another Sennheiser purchase."
5,GREAT SOUND,GREAT HEADPHONES. HAVE ANOTHER TV NOT TO FAR AWAY NOW I CAN WATCH MINE WHILE NOT BOTHERING ANYONE ELSE OF THEM BOTHERING ME. LOVE IT.
5,Exceeds Expectations,"I bought a low cost Wal-Mart version of this product for $25. This proved to be a waste of time.I bought the RS-120 off the internet and am quite pleased with the performance. Other posts have complained about hissing - I have only experienced this when the sending unit, in my case the computer, is idle and not playing anything.Again I am quite pleased with this model and would recommend it to anyone who wants to go cordless for a distance of 40-50 feet."
2,The hissing will drive you mad!,"I bought these headphones, hoping that they will allow me the freedom to move around the house while still being able to hear the stereo. These headphones do have great range: I was 50 feet from the base, with two walls of separation, and could still hear the sound as clearly as when I was right in front of the base. Unfortunately, the clarity of the sound, even when you're right next to the base, is not very good. A high-pitched whistle pierces my ears, and I just had to return the headphones. I don't recommend them."
2,Died...,"I had these headphones for about a year before they stopped working. I simply cant keep all boxes and so no longer have this one, after at least 6 months good useage I just cant justify the storage space. They worked fantastically, anywhere in the house, comfortable, great sound quality, I loved them. But for some reason, the transmitter light has stopped working (That is the one which comes on when you turn on the headphones I believe) and now all I get is static, I have tried all levels of tuning and taken advice from reviews on here but just cant get them back working. I have tried everything I can think of, but to no avail. Extremely disappointed about the staying power of what was otherwise a super product for me."
3,Broke costs more to repair then buy new,It has good sound but my husband says it pinches his head and ears and when it fell off his head the system board inside of the one ear piece the corner of it broke off making it not work. I looked at repairing it and it cost more then I paid for it.So the system board is too fragile or needs some kind of protection around it to make it less apt to break. So my husband doesn't want me to buy another one because they are not that comfortable on his head and too expensive if it breaks so easily.I will just have to listen to his TV being too loud for me to hear myself think.If anyone has any better idea for my problem send me an email markleyfam@aol.comKit
3,the article badly engineered?,"I am not using the earphones, since they seem to be badly planned or thought out. If one has the earphones on, and wishes to change the volume, it is easy to move the tuner control instead of the volume control.I suggest that the volume control be placed further away from the tuning control. Could it not be switched with the on/off button?"
3,Bad engineering,"Simple complaint. If I tilt my head forward, the headphones slip off. The foam Sennheiser selected to cover the ear is smooth and slippery. So you have to keep your head upright--perhaps good for posture but Sennheiser simply goofed, or were careless. There is no way to ""tighten"" the fit either. Duh!"
1,Disappointing Product!! Sennheiser HDR 120 Supplemental HiFi Wireless Headphone,"I received the Sennheiser HDR 120 Supplemental HiFi Wireless Headphone before Christmas. I truly believe the Sennheiser HDR 120 Supplemental HiFi Wireless Headphone would last longer than 90 days. However, the headphones stop working. Now, I must replace the headphone, therefore I am out of $59.00. Wow, Amazon's 30 day policy is a joke!! It is a shame in today's economy customers are ripped off!!"
4,Great headphones,"Our son's bedroom is next to our bedroom so television watching always disturbed him. We purchased two of these headphones and so far they are working great. As the charge begins to diminish, you do have difficulty with sound and static so we have tried to just routinely pop them on the charger. We don't use them any where else in the house so I can't speak to working distance but for tv viewing from bed, they work great - better sound than the television without headphones. Just wish they weren't so pricey."
3,Too Pricey,"For the price, I was expecting far better comfort and cushioning. After 30 min's your ears start to hurt badly.I have used other cheaper products from SONY and regret not going back for them. Other sound quality parameters are good, nothing exceptional."
1,Bad Decision,"I was expecting a much better sound quality based on the manufacturer's name, the signal is poor. I am using it at 10 feet distance from the transmitter and there is a hiss on the background. If you adjust the tuning knob you can reduce the hiss but also reduce the volume and viceversa.This product seem to use old analog transmission, look for digital (Bluetooth) technology which pairs transmiter to receptor.Also, the pads gets your ears hot when using it at movie average time (1.5 hours)No good!"
4,Our finicky eater's favorite food,"This flavor of Fancy Feast is decidedly the favorite of our waif of a cat. She is usually a very picky eater, but this trout flavor really gets her excited.The local store ran out of this flavor and may not restock it, so I ordered online. We got a good price and the case of food arrived in good condition.I was a little confused by the old label image that was on the web site that is just different enough from the new label that I had to double check that I was getting the item that I was expecting.It turned out to be the correct item, so all was well."
3,don't have book yet,"I will not be able to review this book untill late October because i'm in Wyoming and the book was sent to Indiana, we are going to Maine before going back to Southeast indiana, where the book had to be sent for me to get it."
3,Great Title Song,"I actually bought this soundtrack after hearing the song ""Across 110th Street"" on Entourage (during the credits). I had forgotten how good a song it is by Bobby Womack, so I explored further. I don't believe it is on his greatest hits, but if it is, I suggest getting that over this soundtrack. The disk is pretty short in length and at times really felt like a soundtrack minus the movie, which of course changes the music.However, not bad music and would not be a bad pick up if you like seventies style music (think police or chase scene music from the seventies)."
4,An good source for those with CFIDS and their families,I found this book to be very well written with an style that was casual and easy to read. The information is through when needed yet doesn't overwhelm. It has been the best on the subject of CFIDS I have read.
1,"music part worked at store, but not one week later when I gave gift","When I gave the gift to friends they said ""Oh great, we had this and our daughter loved it, but the music button stopped working. how perfect to have a new one."" Imagine the disappointment when the music button on the gift I'd just given them did not work."
2,Music Part did not work...,"could be just the one I purchased, but was one of the reasons I got it. Was not worth buying without."
3,Access 2000 for Windows: Visual QuickStart Guide,"I find this book too light even for beginners. Each chapter barely skims the meat of Access. The interface itself is quite intuitive so the book merely walks the user through each section and lightly touches on building a simple table, form or report. If you know Excel, the Access interface isn't that much different but to really take advantage of Access' DB utilities, you would want a deepr book."
5,A wildlife conservation story to inspire,"Dr. Richard Leakey has authored a compelling account of his time at the helm of Kenya Wildlife Services. The book recounts the bush war against poaching, and contains a very vivid description of Kenyan political life. Sadly - and ironically - the success of Dr. Leakey's management of KWS created a long list of political adversaries that eventually forced Leaky to resign from the post.There can be no doubt that Dr. Leakey has been the chief architect behind the saving of the African elephant from extinction by the hands of poachers. Dr. Leakey's work stands as one of the most important wildlife conservation achievements of all time. Finally, I believe Dr. Leakey is one of the - perhaps last? - great Kenyan patriots. This story inspires. If there were ever a Nobel Prize for bravery and commitment, surely it would be his."
1,Smokie,"Item came in on time without much delay, but the songs in the CD were different from the list of what it said it would.What a disappointment!The picture on the cover is also different from advertisement and even the picture is not so clear making the CD look quite cheap.Now I think that the seller sent me a wrong one, although it is also ""The Best of Smokie"", but another one that I don't like much.Bad experience."
1,Poorly Written with little insight,One could conceivably embark on several trajectories of inquiry as a means to review the complex issue of ethnomusicology. Sadly Kingsbury's work lacks any clear methodological point of departure and the reader is left with one big middle. The work has the core information and research needed for a great book but lacks a clear direction. Save your money do not buy this book!
4,A good basic kit,"I only need to deal with Coax cables occasionally, so I didn't want to purchase an expensive name brand tool, but this kit comes with everything you need to do the job well, and seems to produce good results consistently. All the cables I've made are working great. The instructions are terse, but just look up a good howto online if you don't already know how to use the tools."
4,good value,"This kit is a great value for someone who simply needs to make the occasional repair or adjustment to their home cable or satellite setup. I've used it to replace connectors on a DirecTV hookup that is exposed to the elements and tends to rust. It takes very little time and effort to remove the old connectors, strip the wires, and attach new connectors. If you're a professional, obviously look elsewhere for sturdier tools. But for the casual DIY person, this kit is everything you need."
5,games,"great product, great price, fast shipping, my grand-daughter loves all the putt-putt games-when-ever I can't find a product locally I go to Amazon"
5,We love Putt-putt,"This game is a huge favorite at our house. My 3 year old son absolutely loves it! We played it once together all the way through (rescued all the baby animals) and now he enjoys playing it by himself. Even though the game doesn't change, he plays it over and over (3 times through today alone)! I also purchased another Putt-putt game as well as a Freddi the Fish game but I'm waiting for my son to get tired of Putt-putt Saves the Zoo...so far he hasn't!"
1,Bad Design -- Look Elseware!,"Sony really should stop making alarm clocks. This is the third SONY alarm clock I have purchased, and I have really not been happy with them. I don't know why I keep buying them! I bought this one as a gift for a friend, and feel guilty about it. The volume control is analog, and it is difficult to locate on the side. The controls are in general difficult to use. As far as I can tell, there is no battery backup. When the power goes out...you have to reset the clock...and set the radio stations from scratch!The TIMEX T309T is a much better option. The pop-out CD mechanism is a little weird, but overall it is WAY better than the Sony version. You can pretty much access the controls in the dark, and there are two digital volumes (sleep, and alarm/regular). Plus, it has battery backup!"
4,Getting to choose my own music to wake to - touchdown,"CD has been waking me up 5 days a week for 8 years - The sound isn't Bose but neither is the priceNo battery back up -It has 3 different wake up times which you can set for all or one to go off.The open/close for the CD is easyThe print on the buttons is too small - resetting the clock is always an adventureDisplay is normal with 3 settings for bright, not so bright and sleep - it looks exactly like the picture you see here"
