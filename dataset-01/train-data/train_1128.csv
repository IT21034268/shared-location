5,A great gift of love for Valentine's or any other day,"Very well written, easy to read. Fun to participate in. Sexy and non-threatening. It's sensual/cerebral enough to give to a woman and sexual/physical enough to give to a man. Sexy box houses an easy to follow guide and tarot deck."
4,"Umm, it's a for dummies book, Dummy","It's a book to serve as cursory intro and overview to nanotechnology. As someone not involved in the sciences since school days, thus far it's proven to be interesting and readable. I'm not done though, so we'll see."
1,If You're Serious About Learning Nanotechnology...Look Elsewhere,"If you want a 'fluff laden' book, then this one is for you; however, if you want to know more than just how to spell 'nanotechnology' you may want to look elsewhere. Remember, it is for Dummies."
4,Single Principies,Made Nanotechnology clear and easy to understand. Provides a pointed introduction to the fascinating subject of nano-techlogy with emphasis on the applications.Juan Carlos M. Escobar-remolina
3,Good info but the writing could be better...,"When I saw this book, I thought it would finally satisfy my thirst for knowledge about this subject since I knew next to nothing about nanotechnology. This book has some great information of what this technology can do and some companies that are working on making our lives better through the use of these machines. The problem that I had with this book was that it repeated itself. They talk about the properties about gold (for example) a lot throughout the book, which is fine if it was different information each time. However, they mention the same properties over and over in different chapters... Sometimes I swear they must have copied and pasted the same sentences into other parts of the chapter while changing just a few words. It is almost like each chapter is its own book that has to remind you of the things discussed in the previous or the next book. It has good information but the repetition of phrases and information annoyed me..."
3,User friendly,User friendly guide to nanotech. Easy to read. Fun to read. Did get a bit repetitive at times. Overall informative.
4,"Pretty good....still naughty, with a lil twist","This is a pretty decent song actually. I wasn't too sure at first because I couldn't picture 3LW with Naughty By Nature. It turns out that 3LW's hook saves the song, just because the verses aren't as good as they used to be. It's kinda like a party type of song, and its pretty good. Make sure you check it out."
1,Painfully Disappointing,"This is a terrible cd, I've tried to listen to it several times and each time I get a headache. Just a poorly produced cd with a little bit of everything thrown in like a Chagall painting but with no success. , my goodness you are better off listening to Youtube."
4,cute movie,"This is a nice, easy to watch movie. I like John and Joan Cusak and they are both in this! Brought tears to my eyes once and laughter several times. I liked it!"
4,Good movie,"It is a good movie of a father's love. But is not any father, is an adoptive father's love. Great movie."
4,Martian Schmartian,"I'm a John Cusack fan but don't normally like PG movies. Yet this movie grabs onto you from the beginning - thanks to Cusack's performance, and no thanks to Amanda Peet's - with a fine screen play and some great directing that follows a story of an adoption of a little boy who really thinks he's from Mars. The story ends dramatically and lets you wonder if the boy is indeed from outer space or not. I'd have rated this movie PG-13... I think some scenes could be disturbing to smaller children."
5,Great Movie for the family or friends,"This is a story about a man who opens up his heart and life to a child who was lost and confused in his identity. I loved it, my daughters friends loved it and even the seniors living in my building love it. I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. I really enjoyed it and was so glad when I found it here on sale"
5,I was in tears at the end!,"I began watching this thinking ""ok this will not be one of his best efforts""...was I ever wrong! He is powerful, sensitive, and just amazing! By the end of this movie, I was in tears; and trust me it is not easy to get that result! This is 2nd on my all-time favorite list by Cusack! I will be purchasing this one so I can watch it over again. He is simply amazing!"
3,heartwarming,"this was a funny, yet sadly heartwarming movie. I could only imagine the challenges of going through an adoption, let alone adopting such a ""special"" child. My wife was laughing one moment and crying the next. Was definately interesting enough to keep me awake."
3,A movie or a PSA?,"A very nice family movie that is great for those looking to get into/already involved with adoption. Felt that it was almost more of a ""adopt-a-child"" drama-mentary rather than an ingenious piece of film making. Don't get me wrong, it was a nice attempt at a movie, and did a great job at displaying the trials of adopting kids...but was so light in anything of substance that I almost forgot I was watching a movie and started to reach for the phone to donate to a local adoption agency. That might be the point of the movie, and if so, it succeeded. Great for soccer mom's and family's, and I'm sure Lifetime will enjoy replaying this movie on their network until it becomes more stale than ""Golden Girls."""
5,*Think With Your Heart!*,A movie that shows how important it is to feel like you belong and are loved.I love John Cusack and I think he was perfect in this movie.Bobby Coleman did very well as the martian child.
3,If you are thinking about adopting a kid...........,"watch this movie. Good movie, well done and good stars. Kinda hard listening tothe martian kid, he whispers all the time. They should send him to a speech therapist.No special effects; except eating M&M;'s. Just an outcasted eccentric little kid, who haveloss his parent's and is trying to find himself. Good performances."
3,Family movie,I received this movie in a very timely manner. This is important.The movie is a nice family movie.
2,Sickly sweet,"Sticky sweet story about a widower who adopts a kid that no one wants (and who thinks he's from Mars). If this wasn't John Cusack, I wouldn't have made it through the first 15 minutes without throwing up. By-the-book storytelling, cliches abounding, and sappy, happy ending. Cuscack is so watchable though that he can make even this dreck seem okay. This was the perfect airplane movie - it passed the time, but I'm glad I didn't watch it at home when I could be doing something else."
2,Not what I was expecting,"Definately not what I was expecting. The child is not really from Mars. I couldn't even watch the whole movie, I really don't like it. It was a waste of money renting it. Oh, and I would like to meet the idiots that wrote the summary on the back of the box and in the info that it shows on Dish Network Pay-Per-View."
4,"If he is a Martian, so am I!","A well written novel becomes a very good movie in which we get to know a very disturbed child.The adoptive parent is himself a very strange fellow.This is a good chick flick and very heart warmingand tear jerking. I think kids will like this movie as well, so it is a good family movie."
4,Good source on the German high command organization,"The book is interesting for the student of World War II, since it gives a good account of life at Hitler's headquarters, the ambiance and the point of view of the general staff on the strategic situation. However, there is a lot of emphasis on the bureaucracy and organization of the German Army, and on the power struggles inside the General Staff, which I found not very interesting. You often get the impression that the author views the war more as a professional challenge, without expressing his opinion on its political and strategic implications."
2,Limited Historical Interest,The book is one of a large number written by German Officers after the war. All of these books were of some interest but had one fatal flaw. That was that the germans had little knowledge of what was happening in Russia and the dynamics of its defence. Most books from this time tend to have a common theme. Masses of Russians coming from every where and it was all Hitlers fault.The book has large slabs of Hitlers dialogue in it. This was fairly interesting. The inclusion of the dialogue was included to show his irrationality. The reality is somewhat different with Hitler appearing from time to time a bit obsessed but in general terms having an idea of what was happening and a quick mind for detail.The book fails at times trys to limit the armies responsability for a number of war crimes including he order to execute without trial Russian party officials. This part of the book lacks any conviction.The book is of some historic interest but scholarship has passed it by.
2,I loved the premise but the payoff failed,"I really wanted to like this video. However I fell asleep twice. I did go back and re-watch those areas but found very little. The video was just to slow in developing the story and ""like"" of the characters. and forgive me, but it was very boring. Rent maybe, if you have insomnia, but... ."
1,????,"WTF ? That's what you'll be asking yourself watching this movie, as in Why The F*** don't I turn this movie off. No story development, 3/4 of the time you have no idea of what or why things are happening, the other 1/4 you don't care. Stare at a blank TV screen for 90 minutes or so, it'll be better than watching this dog."
1,Across the line,"don't waste your money. the acting, the story, the whole movie sucked the movie doesn't deserve the time to type the review"
3,Just waiting to die ...,"Compared to the first movie, this was tepid.Characters were waiting to die.The plot was weak.Good for passing time only ..."
2,"Good cast, but film miss the mark.","This film had a lot of potential; the plot was jump started and became a moving target never making its point. The good cast held this film together and nice scenes in Mexico were good---but the film never seem completed to me. The script must of been chopped up from the original or something, in the end this film makes for a remake in the future with a top action director to get it going instead of wasting time with facial cream (a nice touch but overkill in film) and other useless scenes."
3,Krudler,"The quality is ok, but my big beef is that the segment with the musical guests has been taken out! What why would you take that out it makes no sense all those classic snipets like Simon and Garfunkel. Total jipe it was in the original airing on TV, lame!"
3,"Medicore hero, medicore book","It is an interesting formula for literary success. Take a man whose career was a footnote to momentous events and produce a book which mirrors this relationship. Is the book ""balanced"" or just muddled? We will never know, because Mr. Thomas could not refrain from bombarding us with his opinions and conjectures at every possible opportunity. Next time, Mr. Thomas stick with the facts."
1,One Battle Wonder,"Mr. Thomas provided great in sight into his subject, John Paul Jones. However, instead of taking over 300 pages he should have submitted it to a weekly journal. Like Washington's revolutionary battlefield experience Mr. Jones, the myth, is greater than reality. It's sad to think the American Navy has given him such a predominant place in its archives. If you are struggling in trying to find a good biography I recommend McCullough's Adams or Truman or Brand's ""The First American"" on Franklin. Come on Evan pick a better subject for your next book."
3,"Hero, flawed","With great attributes come great flaws. An interesting look at the""father"" of the US Navy. Thank your lucky stars, you did not fight in this era."
2,Disconnected from the Revolution,"If based on Thomas' account, it's a wonder that the US Naval Academy found Jones worthy to take up space underneath the chapel. Thomas went to great pain to portray Jones as a tragic figure and not the brilliant patriot that he was. Descriptions of romantic interludes (again failed tragic relationships) took up more pages than did his epic battles. Book was a bummer."
4,Background to US Navy Traditions,"John Paul Jones was a historical figure, but I really did know much about him until reading this very well written story. I gave this book to a number of friends this year as a holiday gift. Jones made two voyages around England during the Revolutionary War sailing ships procured for him from France. There have been modern ships in the Navy named Ranger and Bon Homme Richard, but I did not know until reading this that those were the names of Jones ships during those famous voyages. After reading this you will know the answer to a great quiz show question which is who is the patron, that the ship, Bon Home Richard was named after. I look forward to reading the story that Evan Thomas just released describing American naval heroes of WWII."
3,john paul jones,"when i ordered i thought i was getting the movie with Robert Stack,it was nice , but not what i expected.."
3,Good read despite incorrect references,"Two things about the book bothered me...1) The incorrect reference to George Patton's revolvers as PEARL handled. They were IVORY not PEARL...this was dispelled in the movie. As I recall from the movie Patton (George C. Scott) said only a New Orleans pimp would own a PEARL handled revolver. Sad he perpetuates the myth.2) Thomas' use of jury-rig (which is when a court jury is seen as deciding, on a legal decision, despite and counter to the facts presented). I assume he ment jerry (gerry) rig which is World War 2 American slang for german 'creative engineering' when using available supplies to suffice when appropriate supplies are unavailable.Aside from those annoyances, I found the book a good read."
3,OK for a quick read,"Must confess I bought this book for $2.00 at a yard sale (with illegibly scrawled dedication that might be by the author) not directly from Amazon. However, it motivates me to buy a used copy of Samuel Eliot Morrison's biography of JPJ from Amazon.The book is good for a quick read, since I start by knowing nothing about JPJ's life. I would not want to have lived a life such as his or to have died so young (45).The main issue I have with Evan Thomas, is that he is one of those writers who very actively imagines what his subject saw and felt. Once you become conscious of that feature of his writing, it is present on nearly every page. I won't call it a flaw, but it is not the approach a prefer a historian to take. So I'm now very curious to see how the much-praised biography of JPJ by Morrison reads by comparison."
1,SHABBY ATTEMPT TO LOWER!!!,"This biography by Evan Thomas of John Paul Jones, an Icon in the history of America, is a shabby attempt to present him as less than a true naval hero and seeks to demean him in very unnecessary ways throughout the biography. Then, belatedly, retracing his comments in a half-hearted retraction. Thruout the book, one must read between the lines to discern the true man, rather than the pained juvenile described by the author. If Evan Thomas needs to write books, I hope he next chooses a fiction base, as his ability to communicate a true portrait of a lasting American Patriot is nonexistent. One wonders why he choose to attempt to lower a true Naval Hero in our eyes."
1,Not the Father of the US Navy...,"While an important Captain in the American Revolution, this guy left to Sail for the Russians... The TRUE FATHER OF THE USA NAVY IS JOHN BARRY!!!"
5,Very very good,"Very good album, amazing guitars in this album, and unique vocals. Sounds some what like Children of Bodom."
4,Great if you're looking for a melodic onslaught,"Ok, like many others have said, Norther does sound like Children of Bodom in many ways, but they do have their own sound, it just doesn't jump out at you right away. But if you listen closely and more than once, you will find that Norther is not a ""Bodom ripoff"" as some have said. The keyboards are used for more than just dueling solos and the guitars are not tuned down on this album, as opposed to COB who does tune lower. There is a lot of melodic riffing and soloing, with some very harsh vocals to boot. Petri Lindroos is a strong vocalist in the vein of Alexi Laiho, but again, with a few listens, you'll be able to distinguish his voice from Alexi's. Overall, a good listen and worth your money - I still prefer Children of Bodom over this band, but that doesn't take away from the skill that this Finnish band has. Check 'em out."
5,The best,I have been a subscriber for about 5 years and have enjoyed every single issue. Oprah has it all!
5,o review,I was very happy to find such a great deal on one of my favorite magazines. I can't believe I have gotten two issues so soon.
3,LLH,I still haven't received the magazine. I think it's scheduled to start delivery in March.I am only interested in magazines that are the special prices. The regular price of a subscription magazine is too high.
4,Better than average magazine,Enjoyed seeing it in my mailbox when I got home but not the one I took in the bath with me.
2,Oprah,This is a typical magazine. Lots of ads. Simple mainstream articles. I glance at it and give it to the local hospital. It is good for people who don't have the energy to concentrate but want a distraction.
3,O Magazine,I still have not received my first issue and it's been 2 months since I placed the order.
2,Disappointed,"Ugh. I've been a fan of her show for years (and I'm only 33), and I'll be honest, when the magazine fist came out I could care less. But the past couple seasons of her show have been ... I don't know... (cringe) I know it's harsh -- she just felt disingenuous, out of touch, unrelatable. When I saw a sale on her magazine for $5 I jumped on it, thinking it'll humanize her content more, fill in the gaps that I felt from watching her show. It doesn't, it reads like a play by play of her tv show segments.I am disappointed with her magazine."
2,Too soon to review,"I love Oprah and her web site but still am patiently waiting for my first magazine to arrive. I did go out and buy the May magazine from then news stand, and now see the June one is out as well on the stands. I get my exercize by going out to the mail box everyday looking for that coveted subscription to start home delivery... sigh... guess I have to be patient. This was a gift to myself so if you are giving it as a gift to someone, I would recommend getting them their first magazine from the news stand to tide them over until the subscription actually starts....."
5,It's as good as you think,"If you like Oprah, you'll like this magazine. I got it for my birthday, then gave it for Christmas. There are wonderful articles with practical insights and advice. Loads of advertising space, but isn't that how the television show is?"
1,Caution: Never received a single issue,"Just a caution: I ordered this 3 months ago and haven't seen a single issue yet. Magazine debited my account right away, but failed to show the same diligence in sending the product. Stay away unless you can afford to lose your money."
1,Didn't start receiving it yet.,"I usually enjoy this magazine, which is why I renewed, but the renewal process is not seamless, and I have not started getting the 2013 issues yet."
4,All my friends love it!!,"My Oprah magazine goes through about 8 of my friends and their families, passed from one to another. They all enjoy it as much as I do. We laugh about how much mileage we can get from one magazine."
1,o,I have not even received the ordered item and it was ordered over a month ago. Kinda tough to rate or get excited about it.
1,NEVER RECEIVED!,"I ordered this magazine 12-13-2009 and have never received it as of yet. You wanted my review, so here it is!"
4,better than expected,The first few pages are nothing but ads. But there are several good articles. I would reorder this magazine.
1,just okay,mag not all that good. not even good enough to go through a second time as I usually do with mags.
2,Disappointing,"I thought this would be a great mag, but have been disappointed and wouldn't renew. Most of thefashion recommendations are too expensive for me or any of my friends or family. The advice isnothing new. No great tips or tidbits. Overall, I expected more from Oprah."
1,Oprah magazine,"Made a big mistake by renewing this way.I had hoped to renew my subscription and a gift subscription, both for one year. The company ended up just renewing my subscription for TWO years. I won't make this mistake again."
3,Too many adds,"Now I know why Oprah has so much money! All the advertisements in her magazines! It is literally flooded, and it's hard to find the next article."
5,Oprah Magazine,I am very happy with the service I received on this purchase. I sure that I will make more purchases with amazon in the near future. I couldn't be more satisified with service your organization provided.
2,Magazine Is Sent Unwrapped,"Great magazine, but for some reason Hearst send it unwrapped - not even in an paper envelope. As a result magazine often arrives in mail with dog ears on the pages or creases on the cover before I've even had a chance to touch it, let alone read it. Not to mention, without being able to tell if anyone else read it before it arrived...very disappointed."
4,O magazine,"I for the most part like O magazine, the articles are usually interesting and informative. I also really liked the great deal Amazon was offering."
3,Love this magazine! Beware of Amazon!!,"It is easy to look back and see one's history when getting magazine subscriptions on Amazon. I received a bill in the mail for a one year subscription to Oprah, but wait!?!! I paid for a full year's subscription in December 2010? So, Amazon, and anyone else who might know? Why am I being billed again already???"
1,You can never cancel!!,"I have been trying to get rid of this subscription for two years now, DO NOT ORDER THIS MAGAZINE!!! The magazine itself is only mediocre, maybe that's why they ignore cancellation requests? I don't know but I will never order anything from Hearst Magazines again."
3,good magazine overall,"Lets face it, Unless you have Oprah money no one can afford ""Oprah's Favorite"" anything. But the graphics are clear. And when the magazine does a fashion spread they tend to do a woman of varying size ranges."
1,NEVER RECEIVED AN ISSUE,"I ordered this one-year magazine subscription on Amazon.com. The first issue was to arrive between January 15 and 29, 2010. It is now February 12, and I have not received an issue yet. My credit card was charged on December 16, 2009. I would like my money back. I will not order magazines from Amazon.com again."
1,"a month later, still have not received the magazine","I ordered this magazine with the auto-renewal on March 5, 2011, and here it is a month later, still nothing in the mail. Will wait to get my credit card statement and hope that I was not charged."
1,"if yoou want advertisements, this is for you","There is probably 300 pages in this magazine, and 3 that are articles. This is one of the worst ""magazines"" i have ever come across. If you have no interest in learning or reading and love advertisements, then this is the magazine for you!"
2,why is she on the cover every time???,"This magazine is not interesting at all....Actually it is very boring and I'm a big fan of the show. Oprah is on the cover of every magazine ??? Why? I will not be ordering this again ,it is a waste of money."
1,Do NOT accept the $5 special price,"Last night, I ordered O as a gift for my mother. When I went to check out, I saw there was a special price of $5.This morning, I see I was charged FOUR time at the $5 rate. Called customer service, and the rep said there is nothing they can do... can't cancel, and he couldn't even explain to me how it happened. So now, I don't know if I'm getting four copies of the magazine, or if I paid more than full price for the mag.The customer service rep said if I get four copies, I can bundle them up and send them back to Amazon for a refund... but this is a gift. Not really the way I wanted my mom's birthday to go.I'm not sure if this is an Amazon glitch or something from the publisher, but I'm not happy about my experience with O magazine so far."
2,A bit disappointing...,"Everything that Oprah does, she seems to do so well. That's why I find her magazine disappointing. I frequently pick it up at the newsstand, at a friend's, or in a waiting room. And every time I keep hoping I'm going to experience an ah-ha moment when the magazine profoundly affects me. Never happens. It's all too similar to the other big-name women's magazines. Tons of ads, watered-down content, little useful advice."
3,I've been asked to write a review....,"I've been asked by Amazon to write a review of my subscription to ""O"" magazine. HOW can I write a review to something I haven't even received yet?! I ordered AND paid for this magazine on December 13, 2009 and have yet to receive a single issue! When I asked about it recently, I was told I wouldn't receive my first issue until March!! Needless to say, I'm not happy with the service of Hearst Amazon, can't say how I like the magazine!"
3,"have not received the item, so can't review it.","I don't know why I've been sent this request for a review, as I have not received the first issue yet. The rating I gave it is just to get this printed"
3,anitcipating,"I have enjoyed the O magazines that I have purchased before. I am sure I will these also, but the first magazine has still not arrived. The price is great however. I look for it any day now."
1,No Magazine,Ordered in December. I have yet to get a magazine. I think I made a big mistake. No answer as to why I have no magazine.
1,Still have not received my first issue,So far not very satisfied! I am still waiting for my first issue to arrive. Paid for it on 12/6/12 - almost 2 months ago.
1,O MAGAZINE,i CANNOT TELL YOU HOW THIS MAGAZINE IS AS ALL i GOT WAS A LETTER THAT THEY WERE BACKED UP ON ORDERS AND WOULD RECIEVE IT LATER. THAT WAS MONTHS AGO. WHAT HAPPENED.
5,A gift,This was a gift for my ex mother in-law. I don't know if she ever opened it up. What a waste. I would have loved to read it each month. It is a good magazine.
1,Don't Order Magazines from Amazon!,"I placed an order for this magazine over 3 months ago, and still have not received my first issue yet! I contacted Amazon and Hearst, and no one has been helpful! Good magazine, but I would suggest using one of those tear-out cards and mailing that in for quicker delivery. If this is how long it takes, I will never order magazines from Amazon again."
3,Getting Old,"Now that Oprah Show is officially off the air, maybe this magazine ought to be retired also. It seems to be getting old. Every issue there she is on the front cover.all airbrushed and made miraculously thin. Occasionally we get a glimpse of Mrs. Obama or Ellen with her but its usually her out there grandstanding and taking your money again so she can tell you what she knows for sure and what items she likes best.Well, after she basically came out against Christianity, I'm not sure if I care for her opinions. And, I sure can't afford most of the things she likes best. So, retire OPRAH. Come out with a OWN magazine with a new format and let's see what you got.P.S. She does usually have some good book reviews.Belloccio Airbrush Makeup Bag Airbrushing Cosmetic Bag"
3,"It is decent, but...","What I found to be a total letdown was the complete absence of bikini or lingerie photos of Ms. Winfrey. Other than that, all the recipes for low-calorie desserts were fabulous."
1,Can't Review,I can not review something that i have not received. I thought I would have received my first issue by now but have not.If and when i receive the magazien i order i will be happy to review.
3,OLD WOMEN WILL *LOVE* THIS MAGAZINE!!,"IF I LIVED IN A WORLD WHERE I DIDN'T KNOW OPRAH EXISTED AND JUST SAW THIS MAGAZINE SOMEWHERE LIKE ON THE GROUND OR IN THE TRASH, I WOULD ASSUME THE ""O"" IN ""O MAGAZINE"" STOOD FOR ""OLD""WHY? BECAUSE THIS MAGAZINE IS FULL OF STORIES AND LIES AND MYTHS, MOSTLY ABOUT TECHNOLOGY, TO TERRORIZE AND FRIGHTEN OLD WOMEN INTERSPERSED WITH TONS OF ADVERTISEMENTS FOR PRODUCTS THEY NEED TO BUY TO STOP THE AGING PROCESS (TO THAT I SAY ""GOOD LUCK!"" LOL!)I HAVE BEEN BUYING THIS MAGAZINE SUBSCRIPTION FOR MY MOM FOR THE PAST 5 YEARS, MOSTLY BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO GET HER, BUT SHE LOVES IT AND RECEIVING THIS IN THE MAIL EACH MONTH IS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST PERK FOR HER. SO IN SUMMATION I GUESS BUY THIS IF YOU WANT A GOOD CHEAP YEAR-ROUND GIFT FOR AN OLD LADY YOU LOVE BUT DONT KNOW MUCH ABOUT!!"
1,No show O,I ordered O magazine quite a long time ago like some of the other reviewers and it's still a no-show (the only reason for the 1 star rating). It's very frustrating because I really like the magazine. I emailed Amazon but they weren't able to help. Can anyone help us out?
1,I HAVE NOT RECEIVED A COPY OF THE MAGAZINE YET!,"SINCE I HAVE YET TO RECEIVE THE 1ST ISSUE OF ""O MAGAZINE"" IT IS DIFFICULT TO REVIEW IT..I HAVE LOOKED AT THE MAGAZINE BEFORE AND THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE WORTH TAKING IT FOR A YEAR THRU AMAZON. I HAVE YET TO RECEIVE IT--SO THE RATING FOR AMAZON IN THIS CASE MUST BE A ""0""..I AM SURE THE MAGAZINE IS FINE!"
1,Still haven't received the magazine,"According to my records I should have received my first copy of O magazine between January 13 - January 27, 2010. And I still have not received it! I'm not sure what step I should take next to receive the subscription -- which has been paid in full. I purchased the subscription on Amazon.com."
1,where's the magazing?,receiver of this gift has not received the gift and it's been more than 30days from ordering and paying for the gift by me.
1,Not that great a magazine,Hard to recommend. Way too much advertising. Content wasnt all that interesting to me.
1,Not received!!!!!,"I ordered this mag. since it was on sale as a gift for my mother in Dec. 2009. It's now mid-Feb., I've been requested to provide feedback, but she still hasn't received the mag. All other mags. I've ordered have arrived. Plus, it says the subscription expires Jan. 2011, but I ordered 12 issues and haven't received the first yet."
2,"December purchase, haven't received first magazine yet!","When I purchased a subscription to O Magazine in December, I logged onto the magazine's website and was told I would receive my first magazine by February 4. Now when I log in, I'm told my first issue should come by March 4. I'm a little frustrated that it's taking this long to get my first issue."
2,Oprah Magazine,"My only complaint is that I have still not rceived my Oprah magazine and considering that I paid for this in the middle of December, I am a little disappointed as today is February 12th. Hopefully it will be here soon.PS I don't hate the magazine, actually I really like it, but would like to be able to read it."
1,Disappointed with Amazon Order,All these weeks and I still haven't received my first issue. I am very disappointed with this whole experience.
2,Not happy,Ordered this mid december and it is now February 3rd and I still have not recieved my magazine.
1,Where is it?,"I'm sure it will be great when it show's up, but as of January 17 there's no sign of it."
3,Oprah Magazine,I suppose it is ok. I ordered it on Dec 15th and have not received it as of Jan 17. I have paid for it so I guess it will show up soon.
5,Oprah is Oprah,Still the same read. Lost my interest in her mag and will not be subscribing again this year. Needs to keep it real.
3,delivery failure,I purchased a subscription on 12/18/2009 and as of 2/15/2010 I have only received 1 issue. The issue I received was for January and now February is half over and I have not received the February issue. I will not renew when the time comes.
4,The price is nice,"I always wanted to subscribe to O magazine. When I saw that Amazon deal for $5 a year, I jump on it."
1,Oprah magazine has NOT BEEN RECEIVED AS YET,"I have NOT YET RECEIVED MY FIRST ISSUE OF Oprah magazine as promised. It was to arrive during January 2011, but has not shown up. Please explain!!!SO how can I review something I have not received. PLEASE REPLY AS TO WHY I HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY SUBSCRIPTION FORCLAIRE ELLIOTT903 FAIRMONT DRIVEGEORGETOWN, TX 78628"
3,Just another woman's magazine to read. Cancelled my subscription....,"When I first began reading O magazine, it was worthwhile. However, as with other magazines, the quality and quanitity of this magazine have gone downhill. It is okay, just another one of the many woman's magazines out there. I didn't bother renewing my subscription. I don't even read it anymore when sitting in a waiting room, if that gives you any idea of it. All in all, I wouldn't recommend this one."
4,O magazine & inspiration,"Oprah Winfrey's magazine has a lot of inspiration and practical advice for readers - 20's to 80's. I share when done at my local library. I see it snapped up almost as soon as I add it to the pile. I love that ""O"" will not show ads of real fur, which I believe is based on animal cruelty."
4,O! magazine,"I'm not sure how I got this so cheap ($5), and I hope there's not a catch, but I'm liking it! It's a good magazine to read a little at a time, and has a variety of articles."
5,The Oprah Magazine,The O Magazine is great. We purchased 50 subscriptions at the sale price as Christmas gifts. Everyone is thoroughly enjoying the magazine. The promptness of delivery was excellent.
5,O Mag,"I got this subscription for my daughter - who loves the mag. Got this as a Christmas present, but didn't get first issue until after Valentine's Day - guess there were troubles at the publishers."
4,O's balance getting better!.,"The balance between advertisements and features has gotten better. There was a time when there were just too many ads, it made the magazine unappealing to me. I realize ads pay the bills, but why not charge a premium rate and limit the number? Make them pay for the privilige of being in your magazine. I really like the articles and contributors and the info about the latest gadgets, etc."
3,too many advertisements,"Now I know why I paid $5 for the subscription. There are more ads in it than stories. I love real life stories, not look at things I can't buy."
1,No Magazine as of yet,"Ordered two subscriptions in December, here it is Feb 8th and I still have not recieved a copy."
4,I Love This Mag....,"I'm not a huge Oprah fan but I do love this magazine. In fact, I gave it away a few years ago as a gift subscription and the folks were upset that I didn't renew for them. I read A LOT of magazines but this one is the best. It talks about different things for everyday people and it seems to stick to it's demographic. If you want a magazine with a little substance - not just the same old recycled hair, make-up, clothes and sex tips - this is it. The only thing I don't like is Oprah's Favorite Things (I'm not sure if that's the title of the section). Oprah's ""picks"" are always very nice but they are way over the average person's budget."
4,what is at issue ?,"I always read the bad reviews first, to know the other side of the hype. But this time I found that none of those reviews that give only one star is on the magazine itself, but they all are complaining matters of delivery. While I can feel that those revievers are angry, they definitely are not revieving the magazine itself for its qualities, but the delivery process, which is not the same. It's like saying that Shakespeare is a bad author because the book with his dramas did not arrive in time. It's ridiculous, but the editor is to blame for this."
2,Step back from the cover Oprah,"Regardless of the quality of the magazine, it is really annoying to see Oprah on every single cover! and to make it worst, she does not pick ""regular Oprah shots"", instead you look at every issue's front cover and ask yourself ""How did they take that picture? She doesn't even look like her!"" It's as if Oprah is telling all of us ""See how I can look like?"" Every month is just a new testimony from Oprah, that money does do wonders.On the top of that, Oprah's personal thoughts, things, favorites, ideas, even more pictures are all over the few pages that are not advertisement.I still gave it 2 stars because from time to time you can find a good article, but the bottom line is the question: Is this a magazine or a show off ?"
1,I HAVE NOT RECEIVED IT YET!!!!!!!,WHERE IS MY SUBSCRIPTION? - I WANT TO REVIEW IT BUT I HAVENOT RECEIVED IT AS YET!!! - PLEASE HELP!!!
1,This magazine stinks,"I used to like Oprah, until I got a real idea of what she was all about. First of all, why would you put out a magazine with yourself on the cover of every issue? Second of all, Oprah doesn't care about anyone, but herself. She does nothing but exploit people and their mishaps, sadness, and struggle in life to make herself rich. I thought it was absurd that she would talk down on a certain fashion store because they wouldn't let her in after hours. I thought Oprah came from poverty. She should remember where she came from and start practicing some REAL humanitarian work. Oprah is just another money hungry selfish person and I don't see why anyone likes her. As far as the magazine goes, the only thing in it is ads. Oprah, please do something with yourself."
1,CAN'T REVIEW 'CAUSE I DON'T HAVE,"I AM STILL NOT RECEIVING THIS MAGAZINE. AND I HAD A GIFT SUBSCRIPTION ON THAT ORDER, TOO. I'VE BEEN MEANING TO GET IN TOUCH. THOUGHT IT HAD BEEN MORE THAN LONG ENOUGH FOR SUBSCRIPTION TO START."
5,Fabulous in every way !!,"I have had a subscription since the first issue. I enjoy everything about this magazine, the articles, and fashion,are always relevant and up to date. It speaks to those of us ""baby boomers"" who are not ready to slow down yet. It is a large magazine and takes a while to get through but you will pick it up again and again during the month. I never get a chance to recycle it I just pass it on to others who are not fortunate to have a subscription yet.It ties in nicely with her daily show and provides more information on the topics she covers, or just more on the entertainers she features. I always look forward to the next issue."
2,Trying to stop magazine delivery and charge,I signed up for this magazine two years ago. They keep billing me and sending them to me even though I have went to the website and click that I do not want to renew subscription. I now am getting invoices from the Billing Dept. that have no phone number to call and the website has no phone number. I feel like I am being scammed and will never ever renew my subscription once I finally get out of this. Very disappointed about my experience.
1,Boring!,"I love Oprah. I watch her show whenever I get the chance and for the most part, I find her to be insightful and meaningful. I was excited when I received a subscription to her magazine as a gift, but soon after I was disapointed. This magazine is boring and there are many ""filler"" pages. I have been scanning through pages and pages to try to find an article that I find interesting enough to read, but I have yet to come across one. At this point, I can't wait until my subscription ends because I see it as just a waste of paper. Watch Oprah on TV, but trust me, skip the magazine!!"
4,Always interesting and fun!,I like this magazine. I was stranded one night in a hotel with no reading material except an issue of this magazine. After thoroughly reading it cover to cover I was hooked.
3,It's nice,The magazine is nice-some good articles & ideas. Fun for a relaxing read. Paper quality is nice-not thin like some magazines that rip easy.
5,Look forward to it every month,"I love magazines and have many subscriptions. If I could keep only one magazine subscription, this would be it, followed by Real Simple as my second favorite. I order all my magazines through Amazon. I like being able to see all my subscriptions in one place - makes it so much easier to manage. I've never had a problem ordering through Amazon."
5,"Awesome magazine, the best price ever!","I love reading Oprah, the magazine is beautiful with all kinds of ideas for just you. I love the price that Amazon has to offer. it is better than the Oprah price, why pay it? save your money and purchase magazines here."
5,Best Magazine,"I have subscriptions to over 30 (yes, 30) magazines. I love to read and love to be informed of the lastest trends, findings, etc and magazines do it the best. But, of all the mags I receive, Oprah is the best. It is the best for the writing style, information covered and presented, pertinence and practicality (without being condescending, overly sweet or too vague). The other thing I enjoy about this magazine is that it is not afraid to publish articles that may be considered foolish or ""fringe"". It is a good and entertaining read with great articles that appeal to everyone. It is written with intelligence and humor."
2,Surprise Island,"This book takes me back to my chilhood which I have shut out all these years. I have always loved The Boxcar Children seires. I like to have the hardback copies because I can handle them much better. Amazon has come into my life many times and always has a high reccomendation from me, as do many sellers on Amazon."
1,Weird Island,"Okay, this book is so weird in today's context. There is a mysterious young man rooming with the Captain on an island that the childrens' grandfather will choose to let them live on for the summer. The grandfather knows about this mysterious guy but doesn't go check him out on his own. He relies instead on the opinion of Dr. Moore from the first book. And, weirdly, Dr. Moore chooses to keep this mysterious man's secret rather than let everyone know who in the heck is living on the island with a bunch of unchaperoned children. Kids probably won't pick up on this, but I found it wholly creepy that this guy was living under an assumed identity the whole time he pursues getting closer to the kids. In today's time of sexual predators on children, it is actually quite a troubling character. The whole time he lies about who he is as he gets closer and closer to the children. It is sort of a questionable storyline and character."
3,"Generally okay, but mixed","Warner's second in the Boxcar series is pretty much more of the same. Gone however is any real novelty or discovery.This time around it gets a little creepy by modern, postfeminist standards. The girls delight in nonstrenuous domesticity, whereas the boys do the heavy lifting and shop work. Henry assumes the role of Father Knows Best autocrat for the little family, the rich grandfather being mostly absent again.Not too surprising, given that Warner's generation also made the infamous mental hygiene classroom films and social engineering initiatives of the post-WWII era.If traditional, rigidly-defined, sex-linked roles taught by example are okay with readers' parents, go for it. Progressives and modern liberals will surely be appalled. The enigmatic character of Joe could never be written into modern stories.The artwork in this edition of Surprise Island is wretched, nothing at all like the first book's."
2,From Good to Horribly Bad. Watch at your own RISK of wasting your time.,"The 1st half is decent as it explores what happens when long term relationships fail, such as marriages. It tells the truth that many relationships fail because men treat women as sexual objects. So during the second half I was expecting a lot of character growth in the woman's role, which there wasn't. She still ends up a sexual object, just more accepting of that fact.Once the painter with an annoying English accent comes into the picture the movie gets VERY annoying and lame. And if they had a real relationship in life it would definitely fail since he was a grand WUSSBAG! There was no emotional connection between the two characters, which is why it seems that the painter is also using her as a sexual object just as all the other men in her life. She just accepts her sexuality, but at the cost of not growing as a person mentally or spiritually.A movie that started out good but went horribly bad."
1,"Boring, absurd and it dragged.","I bought this film because of a film I saw years ago with Jill Clayburgh and Burt Reynolds called ""Starting Over"". That film was enchanting and humorous. Sorry, this one was neither."
4,"Dated, but relevant","The sometimes sad and sometimes funny story of a woman going through divorce. The movie does a good job developing the relationship as a married couple and the aftermath of relationships, feelings, etc. We especially liked seeing some views of NYC of 30 years ago- how some things have changed so little (Rockafeller ctr) and some a lot (WTC). A good movie, which you probably won't find uplifting, but will find entertaining!"
5,Great rides!!!,"Wow I love spinning and this is a great workout, Very challenging, and the best you can mix you workouts. Very recomended. Great great DVD."
2,Extremely boring and dull!!!,"I was excited to try this but once I did, I realized that I wasted my money. This is so boring!!!! And the backgroung music is uninspiring. She also keeps on talking, talking, talking......I strongly recommend this for elderly folk, say 70 and over."
4,Better than Super Cycle,"Just received this DVD and like it much better than Mindy's Super Cycle video. There are three separate workouts: hills, intervals, and flats. You can also choose a combination of any two or to do all three. The main menu also allows you to choose just the warm up, the workout, or the stretch from any of the three but doesn't allow you to set up a combination and then run the program like some other exercise videos. So if you want to do a combo, you have to get on and off the bike to choose the next segment. Mindy has the decency to look like she's working hard too."
2,"Boring, Bad Music","This video was pretty disappointing. The music is bad, the scenery is cheesey, and the ride overall is boring. It was tough to finish the first ride and I haven't watched it since; I'd rather direct my own ride with music that gets me pumped up! It is nice that you can mix and match rides, but it's very choppy and not well edited. Wouldn't recommend it, but I'm sure it works for some people."
3,"""A Real Workout Not for Beginners""","This DVD Trycicle: Pick Your ride Cycle with Mindy Mylrea is a real workout. However, it is not for a beginner which is what I wished I knew. She doesn't explain enough when you are a beginner. Therefore, I would only recommend this for advit cyclers."
2,Defective tape,The video tape was defective. I was riding along with the tape and it stopped and then jumped back to an earlier position on the tape. The tape then continued from that point. I could never get the tape to complete to the end of the ride. I will not buy any of her tapes again.
1,What were they thinking.....????,"I've seen these movies, have them on VHS. But was looking forward to the DVDs. Whats up with this? This should have cost [less] for how little effort went into these. And this is just a personal but I like the VHS packaging UNIVERSAL did before they when with the ""movie poster"" packaging. Maybe someday well be luckey enough to get a deffinitive collectors eddition box set with some super cool packaging. But as for these double features... the only benifit is the space youll save over VHS. therefore... ONE STAR."
3,The Mummy's Ghost/The Mummy's Curse,"Hokey sequels to the original Mummy movie but for those of you who enjoy the old Universal monster movies, not bad. Good quality reproduction."
4,The Mummy's Ghost/The Mummy's Curse,"The Mummy's Ghost has the mummy kidnapping the girl, and having the whole town come to track them down. There is more to that, but the thing that makes these mummy movies of this era so great, is they a alike, but also different. The Mummy's Curse is probably the odd one out, but in a good way, The Mummy and Princess Ananka come up from an old swamp. Both these movies are a must for mummy movie lovers."
3,So bad it's good,"I've only seen the Mummy's Curse so far but it's amazingly bad.Still, it has that cool, B&W Universal vibe, and if you like that, you'll like this. Actress Virginia Christine looks like a very contemporary alternative bohemian girl (sort of a wavy-haired Betty Page) and the DVD Bio reveals what well-known personality she became in later decades. It's by no means a great film, but I liked it."
1,Getting tired of Mummies,They overdid the Mummy thing at Universal. Nice to see some old character actors but why dosen't someone just trip the lumbering punk and dump gasoline on him or something??? Universal should have quit whith Tomb.
2,Looks cool,"Very cool looking, I put them on my bike and they are sweet. Fast shipping. Good product!"
1,Didn't work for me,This product did not work for me. It made my hip and back hurt worse. I loss my receipt and thru away the packing materials feeling that it was going to be a winner for me or otherwise I would have returned it.
1,Love the idea but it is just too big,"I was really excited to get the pillow. I thought for sure the pillow would fit because I'm tall. I ordered it even though other reviews had indicated the pillow was just too big to fit comfortably for any extended period. But it really is massive and just too big to use comfortably. I took one of the pillows out and it felt so much better but now of course the case doesn't fit. Its a good idea, but the execution could use some more thought and testing before putting it on the market."
3,Size is for average person - no small or large person should order.,"It was a good quality product, but was not usable for me. It would need to be ordered by someone of average size."
1,Leg Spacer Pillow,"The leg spacer pillow didn't work at all for me, I wished I hadn't bought it. It didn't fit on my leg properly so I am unable to use it."
1,Too wide and NON-RETURNABLE,"The product arrived all right, but when folded in half to use as a knee pillow, it became immediately apparent that the pillow is too wide to fit comfortably between an average woman's knees without torquing hips and back. Also, the two sides do not lay flush together as shown in the photo. Only the cheap velcro bits hold it partially together.More distressing was discovering after the fact that I can't return this unused product. I finally found the seller's ""no returns"" policy buried in the AB page; it is NOT mentioned on the Amazon sell page, but it ought to be! This thing is brand new, but I got absolutely no response when I tried to contact AB's non-existent customer service. This is a classic case of ""buyer beware""--I will avoid this seller in future!"
1,Did not work for us,"We bought two of these for our elderly moms who both have back and hip problems. One is a petite lady and the other is tall, medium frame. They both tried numerous times, but neither of them could use the wedge, leg & knee pillow. I think they were TOO thick when folded together to fit comfortably between their knees and help align their backs. This was not a good purchase for our needs."
3,An Interesting Tale,"I rate this one three stars. The plot is fanciful and far-fetched. It sort of lurches along with the action being overly contrived at times, with the characters acting as if they had not a shred of intelligence or common sense. In one scene the characters are shrewdly plotting, in the next, they act with a foolishness that stretches your credulity.Overall this is an interesting read, if not exactly compelling. I have read some of F. M. Whites other works that I enjoyed more. The Crimson Blind comes to mind as a far better novel by this author."
4,A great who dunnit!!,I love mysteries and this one was no exception. Good story and characters. It was an easy read and never boring.
4,At times bewildering motivation but a good read,"Doyle used an American mining camp, as I recall, this author a Mexican gold mine, but the theme is the same, vengeance out of the past. Sometimes a year 2010 perspective hinders sympathetic reception of some of the behavior of featured participants, but on the whole, this is a good read of an essentially Victorian novel. I listened using the Kindle robot reader. I am accustomed to robot readers and am rapidly acclimating to Amazons, so my comments are not those of a novice listener. I found it easy and interesting listening; however, there are simple adjustments to the articulation possible which would measurably improve the verisimilitude of the voice. There are two voices, one each, male and female. I have used only the male, the female being less satisfactory because of losses in higher registers common with aging. It really makes little difference since I find the male voice when reading a woman's part sounds adequately female."
2,Fun while it lasted,"We got this water fall as a gift for my kids 2&4. They had fun with it while it last, but that wasn't long. The ball filled with water, and won't work any more."
2,Wish I read the reviews before I bought,"My son loved this sprinkler, and considering some of the other reviews here, our's lasted longer than most. The 1st 2 days were fine, on the 3rd day it started filling up with water but the sprinklers still worked. On the 4th day the sprinklers stopped working so the only thing it did was fill up with water. Good idea but it needs to be way more durable to work."
2,Might have been fun...,"This ball broke the very first time we used it, within a minute or so. The ball started filling up with water and there is no apparent way to fix it or empty the water out. What a bummer, and a waste of money!"
2,Great until it filled with water & EXPLODED!,"The kids really had fun with this- twice. Then the interior filled with water where it wasn't supposed to be. We tried to drain it, and the damn thing EXPLODED like a water balloon! Watch out for this one!"
1,Mkelley9,"The second time we used the ball something broke inside and the ball filled up with water. I tried, but couldnt get the water to drain out. Total waste of money."
1,money pit,Bought this for my son's 5th birthday party. It lasted 10 minutes then got hung up on a sprinkler head in the yard. The weight of the water inside this toy makes it heavy enough that anything it lands on becomes like a dagger. The three inch hole from the sprinkler head rendered this toy a complete waste of money!
1,Waste of money!,"I purchased this for my 6 & 4 year olds to play with.... we followed product instructions, but after only 15 minutes of play, the ball stopped spraying, and began to fill with water.... my husband was afraid it would burst and hurt the children! I contacted Little Tykes and got NO response! Don't WASTE your money!"
5,what a great toy for summer!,I run a daycare out of my home and wanted a way for my daycare children to be able to cool off for the summer. This water ball is awesome! It is much more attractive than a plain old sprinkler and the children absolutely love it! So far it has held up well. It has been a great investment and the children are having a great time with it.
1,One hit wonder,"Cute idea, and great fun for about 10 minutes. Then it broke. Pretty much a waste of money."
2,Filled with water... and have no idea how to get it out.,"I bought this sprinkler last year... and we got lots of great use out of it. It was very inexpensive so I hate to complain but today was the third time this year we used it. It is now filled with water about half way up. And I have no idea how to get it out! After reading other reviews, I see others have had the same problem. Looks like if I am able to get the water out (still not sure how to do that part) it seems like it will take a long time. Totally bummed since both my kids, 3 and 1, love it!"
2,Great for short term,"Like everyone else has said this ball starts off great. I am on the 3rd use and the ball is already half full of water. No idea how to get it out. After seeing the rest of the reviews I see it's death is imminent. So if you paid $5 for this it's great....anymore than that and you have been ripped off.After trying again: if you open the part you blow air into and roll the ball so it's on the bottom the water will start to drip out. Squeeze it and it goes a bit faster. Maybe the ball got a reprieve after all. Not the big round plug, but the small one."
1,sprinkler ball,This is toy acumulates a lot of water inside and it is almost impossible take the water out.I am very desapointed
2,Did not really work at all,"My son received this toy as a gift for his birthday. It looks like a great idea! However, we hooked it up according to the directions and it didn't work at all. It filled with water right away and only a few small sprays of water came out. It didn't roll around and was just not fun at all for my kids (ages 7 and 4). After a frustrating 15 minutes, we hooked up the regular lawn sprinkler and the kids had a blast."
3,Little Tikes Beach Ball Sprinkler,"This is a great toy and lots of fun for the kids, but only lasted about a week before the water started seeping into the ball and it filled up with water. This made it very hard to put away as the water does not come back out easily because it is actually in the air portion of the ball. The hose connection also keeps popping off, but this may be because of the weight of the water on it."
4,My daughter loves it.,"I got this for my 4 year old daughter. She enjoys playing with balls, so she does enjoy playing with it. The water has a long spraying range. If you are out watching your kids, be careful if the wind changes, because I did find myself getting sprayed once or twice, when the wind change.It has survived two summers, so as long as you take decent care of it, especially if you deflate it and store it away during the winter months, it should last."
1,Not very fun,"When you look at this it looks so fun, but think about it, it is attached to a heavy hose. It is basically a sprinkler shaped like a ball. My kids played with it for literally 5 minutes, and then we went and got one of those crazy sprinklers that sprays water everywhere. That was a lot more fun, and half the price.I will say that the ball was durable, and it would work as a great ball, but it is pretty pricey to not use it for its said purpose."
4,Neat summer toy,"We really like the sprinkler ball. The spray isn't too harsh and the kids all love to just run through the water really fast. The ball can move on its own a little if you put it on a slope and make sure you have extra hose slack. Great summer fun in this one, especially for the price!"
1,Poorest Design I've Ever Seen,"My son wanted and received this for his birthday. It was the worst design I've ever seen. The ball filled up with water within a few minutes of using it, which meant it couldn't be rolled around or played with as shown. To get the water out, it practically had to be ""milked,"" which took hours (seriously) and even then, not all of it came out, so it grew mold and mildew on the inside, which then blocked the sprinkler holes, preventing it from ever being used again. Ended up slashing it open to fit it in the trash can. Total Junk."
1,Wanted to love it but it kept filling up with water,"This was a gift for my son's 3rd Birthday. It looked so nice when we got it and the kids were so excited to play in it. I was disappointed, it only worked for a few minutes and then filled up with water and stopped spraying the water out. My husband emptied it which takes a long time to try to use it again. I would not recommend this sprinkler. They kids only got to play with it twice."
5,Sprinkler Ball big hit at our house,"I purchased our first sprinkler ball in May. Have to be honest, didn't know how long it might last. My concerns were put aside once my three year old daughter and the neighborhood children started playing with the ball, they all had a blast! They played for hours. It is a great way to cool off. We live at the shore and it's great to use for rinsing off after the beach, too. Just had to purchase a new one, someone stole it out of our yard last weekend! We have had no problems with this product at all. Can't wait to get our replacement and start having fun again!"
1,Total Piece of Garbage - Bad Manufacturing,It arrived brand new in its original packaging with two huge holes. Horrible. The product is too cheap for me to bother to send it back - its going straight in the dumpster. Boo on you Little Tikes!
1,WASTE OF MONEY,I thought this would be a great sprinkler for my 6 yr old and 18 month old. Within 5 minutes of play something broke inside and the whole ball started filling with water. I thought it was going to burst! Then it was a fiasco trying to get all the water out. I had to open the air valve and put a stick in it to keep that valve open and squeeze down to let water come out of the water hole. I have since read other reviews that had the same problem. My kids didn't have enough time to see if they even liked the toy. Waste of money.
1,Do not buy....,This toy broke after 5 minutes of use. The tube that sends water to the sprinkler detached and filled the ball with water. There is no way to empty the water out of the ball (except through the air valve)so this toy was ruined before my kids even got a chance to play with it. I also can't take it back to the store because I will have to cut it to get all of the water out of it. Don't waste your money - find another sprinkler that works.
3,decent,"Entertaining enough. I was looking for a good ghost story and that is what this book is. Character development isn't strong, but I didn't expect it."
3,Okay read.,"I was actually suprised that I liked this book. I picked it up on the baragin shelf at wal-mart and thought I'd give it a shot. The story was interesting and kept a good pace. The characters were believable and I didn't think the mystery was too easy to solve. I liked that it was about two people who could see and communicate with ghosts. I don't see many paranormal romances that feature people with that ability, which made this book a bit refreshing. It was set in New Orleans and I loved that. I think it was a good setting for this kind of plot and Graham did an okay job in describing the city. All around this was an alright read."
1,The Ending Is Disappointing,I enjoyed this book because I love any story that involves New Orleans. The characters were good and so was the story line. But where did the ending come from....OUT OF THIN AIR. I waited and waited for a good ending and was thoroughly disappointed. The author seemed to make up the ending just to get the book over with. Everything was settled in the last couple of pages. Don't pay full price...wait for the bargain bin.
2,Some suspense but very disappointing ending,"I like Graham, although her yarns meander and wrap up too abruptly with new characters that appear on the last pages. My biggest gripe is her romances have no heat. There is zero chemistry between heroes and heroines because they are not drawn fully. Ultimately, there is little to hold the book together and remember after it's done. There are far superior romantic suspense writers."
5,Probably my favorite by Heather Graham,"This was the first book by Heather Graham that I picked up and read, and is still my favorite after reading several more. I loved the story, loved the paranormal aspects, loved the characters. I would truly enjoy seeing a sequel; another adventure with this group of people."
5,GOOD MYSTERY,I thought this story was very good. Heather Graham's books always have great dialogue and the character in this book were wonderful. I recommend it.
5,New Orleans Nostalgia,"I thoroughly enjoyed visiting the old New Orleans as I read this book. It's Heather Graham at her best. The characters -- especially Nikki -- were involving and I could easily imagine her mixed feelings when she discovers that she can ""see"" ghosts. A fun read and an excellent, spooky story just in time for Halloween."
2,Ghost Walk,"There is perhaps some irony in the manager of a haunted house tour company being haunted herself. However, Nikki du Monde fails to see it and just wants to know what to do to put the ghost of her newest employee where ever the departed are supposed to depart to. As it turns out, the young woman, Andy, was brutally murdered and it's up to Nikki and Brent Blackhawk to solve the case. Brent is able to communicate with the dead, and from all he's hearing, someone wants to make Nikki one of their number. To keep Nikki safe as well as bring peace to the restless spirits, the killer must be found and stopped.** While the dead were fairly interesting, it was hard to care about what the living characters were doing. The romance seemed a bit forced, and it would have been much more fascinating to see more of what Brent does than focus on Nikki. **Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."
2,Not at all what I expected,When they said used book they meant it. Not in any good condition I have received better.
4,"Book was great, but the ending needed work","I loved this book. I loved hearing about New Orleans. I starting reading it after a trip to New Orleans - the book made me feel like I was there again. I loved the supernatural element of it. However, the ending just came out of nowhere - one minute it was an interesting read; the next minute everything was revealed out of the blue - the ending really needed more work before being released. I was disappointed in that aspect, but the rest of the book was great!"
2,Simple book for those who enjoy easy reads,"This was an ok novel, I thought it would some how be deeper, and a quicker read, however it turned out to be little more then a sheet grabber. A term I use to refer to books that start out with a good idea but end up copying bad romance novels with cliched haunting stories. The writer does not try to grab the reader, instead it cuts from one scene to the next like a bad made for TV movie. I wish I could have stopped reading it, but I am one of the few who cannot stop reading a novel simply because I don't like it. If the story starts, I must know the ending, for this I pity myself. Simple book and possibly fun, for those who like the easy read, and occasionally steamy books... though not for me."
3,Pleasing,This is for anyone who used to watch the old horror movies. A must-have for old horror movie buffs.
5,With All My Heart,"This single CD is so awesome. ""With All My Heart"" is a great song and hearing the guys voices so deeper than they were is so amazing. The medley is cool, too. The trailer on the CD-ROM makes me want to see the movie soo much more. Too bad I live here in Louisiana. I won't be able to see the movie 'til a whole while later."
5,GREAT SONG!!,"I don't have this yet, but it is my new favorite song! It has all the talent of the younger Dream Street, with the flair of deeper voices. And if you think ""Dream Street sounds like a bunch of girls..."" Think again! All of their voices have changed. Their new sound is an NSYNC mixed with a broadway. They are so talented, and this cd is more than worth it!"
4,See your life from the sky,"Well-organized book that is easy to understand, very helpful and provides a thorough understanding of planetary cycles and their influence. Good for people who want to see their life from the perspective of planetary influences and how being aware of them helps in life planning."
1,Keep the propaganda away from my children,"This tape is very popular with children and has lots of neat catchy dinosaur songs. However it is heavily laced with the lie of evolution. It has a song about turtles being evolved earlier than other modern animals as well as numerous other references to evolution and the evolutionary time frame. If you want to keep this type of propaganda away from your children, skip this one."
3,Real life choices we all have to make.,Refreshing to find someone who puts into words the fears and ambiguities that all daughters live with and dread. It is nice to be understood and not judged.
2,Truly a bad daughter,"I purchased this book because I thought I would find solace in the story of another young girl who had a difficult time with her mother, and suffered throughout life with the emotions attached to that. Instead I found Ms. Hilden's style and attitude more akin to a law brief than a memoir of a painful time in her life. She is cold and emotionless and does not draw the reader into the story, except to dislike the daughter. Believe me, I wanted to like this book. I wanted to believe Ms. Hilden when she said her mother hurt her. I wanted to feel her justification for abandoning her mother as she lay dying, but the book simply did not do that. This woman may have every ivy league degree in the world and certainly sounds couragious in overcoming poverty, but it seems she either has never learned to feel emotion or never learned to put it on paper so the reader can feel it too."
2,Uninsightful and Self-Serving,"I was looking forward to reading this book because I, too, feel like a ""bad daughter;"" I feel that I didn't do enough to help my alcoholic mother. Also, like Ms. Hilden, I am an attorney. I found, however, that Ms. Hilden offered no insight into WHY she acted as she did--she simply used her feelings of unworthiness as an excuse to behave badly."
2,"Typical, not bad just typical","I've met a lot of Yale Law grad students over the years. Believe it or not, Hilden seems to be probably middle ground in terms of charm and empathy. You should enjoy some quality time with the truly bad sons and daughters of Eli.Moderately intersting book, good for the ""writing as therapy"" set and those looking for another turn on the Confessions motif available from Augustine to Rousseau down to the self help shelves. Hilden's is better written than the self help books, but not much deeper. If you like this kind of book, you'll like this one.If you don't like this kind of book, I suggest you spend your ducets on the natural opposite of The Bad Daughter. Check out The Good Son by Nick Cave. More interesting and insightful by multiples, and you get to tap your foot."
1,Quite tedious,"The author comes across as almost completely unlikeable. Perhaps this is brave (I certainly wouldn't write a book that made me look this unsympathetic), but the author's complete self-absorbtion and ambition, at the apparent expense of maintaining any meaningful relationships, made me wince."
1,she and her mother are a pair.,"yes, her mother was horrible -- but so is the author, who sounds like one of the most selfish people ever. the writing is very good, and it's thought-provoking, but you will close the book being glad you do not know julie hilden."
1,Too much information,"Ms. Hilden writes this book to cure her own demons and appease her own guilt. She is brave to write it, but inconsiderate to the reader as some details go too far. While she titles the book 'the bad daughter' she never owns up to her own responsibility.I think she was a daughter who did the best she could. I wish she would write a sequel in which she forgives herself. This book made be glad I did not know the author. I hope writing is has helped her find solace."
1,Total turnoff,This book is nothing but one long and tedious account of a self absorbed daughter of a difficult mother. It could have been an engrossing memoir if the author had shown any depth or insight.
5,A well-written emotional tour de force,Ms. Hilden's searching memoir yeilds unsparing insight into the relationship between parent and child. Her elegant narrative grips the reader from start to finish. Ms. Hilden's treatment of Alzheimer's should be read by every relative of every person afflicted with the disease. Such a honest book is a rare gem.
3,Pure Candy,"I've run into the odd mention of humorous vampire novels so I sought this out. I haven't yet read the first in the series, but this was amusing and quick -- altogether a very nice distraction. The ending felt rushed."
2,The only one I could put down,"I've read several of Christopher Moore's books and loved every one! This is the only one I could put down. Based on the reviews, maybe I should pick it up again, but so far it's blather. Two characters insulting one another...where's the humor?"
5,Hysterically funny,"I purchased the audiobook from another website, after listening to a couple of other Chistopher Moore novels. I find them extremely humourous, and this novel was no exception.After beginning this novel, I realized that it had to be a continuation of a previous story (which it is, ""Bloodsucking Fiends"", I will buying that one soon). However, the characters are so well developed, you can easily read this book without reading the prior one.The story is hilarious, laugh-out-load funny, which earned some strange looks in the supermarket as I listened to it. The best character by far is the little Goth girl, Abby Normal. Her goth vamp wannabe ways are hilarious, especially when mixed in with her ""perkiness"", which she see as a definite flaw.I really cannot reccommend this book enough."
2,Too many typos,The only reason for the low rating is because there are a lot of typos in this e copy of the book.For example To night = tonight
4,"You Suck, a love story","Christopher Moore is a wonderful and witty writer. This is the second book in the series,"" Best Fiends;a Love Story"", being the first. I enjoyed this book, but,not as much as the first.However,I am looking forward to a third in the series."
4,Fun Read,"I didn't know this was a book about vampires until I started reading it, or else I would not have started. It's a very good book, well written, great characters (especially Abby), fun to read, cohesive, and smart. The fact that it is about vampires is secondary to it's sheer entertainment value."
4,"Excellent Writing, Stunning Delivery!","I really loved this audiobook. Not only are Moore's writings hilarious (which they are), but they're loaded with references to his other books - a charactaristic I love.The reader (Susan Bennett) is absolutely brilliant. Her talent shines throughout this audio book. Rarely do I laugh out loud - but this one did it."
3,"Cute, but it's all been done before, right?","I've been reading reviews about this being new stuff. But in every vampire comedy I've read, most in the romance and fantasy genre lists, the fake tan thing is there, as are the questions about vampiric ablutions, other bodily functions, and possible antidotes for the ""problem"" of vampirism. So are the wanna-be vamps, the problems with updating the vampire gear, the groupies, etc.So though this is fast-paced and very quirky book - (I did like the duct tape)- and worthy of a read, it is not ground-breaking in any way.BUT it sure is FUN."
5,This book sucks - NOT!,"Mr. Moore continues the adventures of the reluctant San Francisco vampire and her thrall in this very fun book. What's great for me, as someone who works in San Francisco, is imagining the characters as I walk the streets. Mr. Moore's style of writing is very much about the internal monologue (or, with a heavily conflicted person, dialog) and much of what makes his books so much fun is ""hearing"" the thoughts of the characters. Nothing new, I suppose, in terms of style, but what those people are thinking will leave you howling."
4,A good read that will make you laugh out loud,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was funny, well-written and although not overly cerebral, held my interest well into the night. The characters are developed enough to envision and the structure of the book is interesting, especially the journal entries of Abbe Normal. I've read most of Moore's books and haven't been disappointed, and this one continues the trend. I enthusiastically recommend it."
4,Doesn't Suck,This is another great Christopher Moore book. One word of caution however; You will want to read most of his other books first. Not only because you are sure to enjoy them - but because there are a lot of recurring characters.
4,A Non-Grating Modern Vampire Tale!,"Okay, that's a back-handed compliment and bit unfair. Moore's vampires aren't as shiny, undersexed, and banal as his contemporaries, but I hesitated for a while before reading this because, ugh, vampires...Of course, it was excellent. As always, Moore is witty, outrageous, endearing, and mildly poignant. I don't know that this ranks among his best work, but it's certainly fun and charming enough to be worth the read. Especially if you want a break from the ""other vampires""."
4,Good Summertime Read,"This is a light, humorous book, typical of Christopher Moore's hand. Lacking any didactic, socially redeeming values, nor any attempts to elucidate any great truths, it is excellent escapist literature, as it was intended to be. Enjoy."
4,Nothing Beats Christopher Moore Except Christopher Moore,"This is not Christopher Moore's best book. In fact, it's not even in his Top 8. However, even when he's not up to form, there is no one better than Christopher Moore. He's a brilliant writer with not boundaries, and few peers. If you haven't read Bloodsucking Fiends yet, put this book down and finish up the first book. This one, in its opening sentence, spoils the ending of the first one. Christopher Moore is a genius, in the best, most insane way imaginable. You won't be disappointed."
4,You Suck...didn't Suck,"I'm reviewing the audio CD of You Suck. The reader was excellent. The story was funny and interesting. And I loved the way he linked some of the characters and story lines from a previous book "" A Dirty Job"". My favorite character has to be Abby Normal. Maybe we will get a visit from her in a future book. I must say that I was sad when the book was over. I still wanted more of these characters and their stories."
3,A bit of a disappointing sequel,"I am a huge fan of Christopher Moore's books, generally finding his warped humor to be side-splitting. Bloodsucking Fiends and Lamb are my two favorites.You Suck is a sort of sequel to Bloodsucking Fiends. Like many movie sequels, it simply does not measure up to the original. The story line isn't particularly fresh and the humor is largely iterative of that in Fiends. This is the first Moore book that hasn't held my interest enough that I finished reading it over the course of an evening or two.That said, new character ""Abby Normal"" (terrible play on words) and her diary entries are worth the price of the book."
2,usually love his books,"first off let me just say that i love christopher moore's books. if you have not read anything else by him please do not start with this book. fluke, lamb, dirty job, any of those are a great place to start. You Suck was a bummer for me and did not live up to my expectations. I knew all of the characters before i read the story and i still just did not get into it. moore is usually so good with fast, snappy conversations that keep me interested. Plus i just did not laugh out loud while reading this one. this book does not suck, but definitely is not a good representation of what this author is capable of."
3,Good but not great,"This was a bit of a slow starter for me, but it picked up about halfway through. If you weren't a fan of Tommy's whining in the 1st book (Bloodsucking Fiends), then you'll definitely not be happy with his whining in You Suck. Tack on the whining of Abby in this book, and you're in for an all out whine-fest. You Suck still had the same Moore humor though, which seems to be his strong point and why I continued reading his books. All in all, I liked the book, but not as much as the 1st."
3,"Overall, a good story","I love the characters that have been developed throughout all of his books, so I think that's what left me a little disappointed. As fun as Goth Girl is, I think that her journal sections were a bit rushed. Moore took these moments to rush through parts of the story that could have been developed in wonderful ways. I get that it was from the teen-ager perspective, but I feel let down that Moore didn't seem to put the same effort into this book as he did Bloodsucking Fiends and A Dirty Job."
1,New Low,"I read Dirty Job and finished it but didn't like it at all. My wife recently bought two more of Moore's books (thankfully at a bargain bin) without knowing how I felt about the author. I tried this one and it is worse than Dirty Job, it makes Dirty Job look like 1976 Woody Allen. In this book a bunch of slacker vampires and a bunch of slacker vampire hunters wander around not doing much of anything. It goes on and on. The reader yearns for something new and different like a plot or interesting characters. I gave up less than half way through and it is in my DNA to finish all books I start. Anybody want to buy the author's Sequined Nun book cheap? It's unread."
3,This one doesn't suck,"If you loved Bloodsucking Fiends and want to see what happens next, naturally you will want to find out what happens to the Vampire Timothy...Though a big Christopher Moore fan, I hadn't read Bloodsucking Fiends, and so I found about a third of this book really baffling. Moore does work to set out some of the events from Fiends, but a one-page synopsis would have been handy.Overall, I enjoyed reading this one, because Moore is a delightful writer. But I did feel a tad disappointed that most of the really cool stuff had happened in the first book."
3,Funny but Flat,"I like Christopher Moore's style, have enjoyed every one of his books including this one, but ""You Suck"" is my least favorite so far. Through irreverent humor and snappy dialog, Moore has been able to draw laughs from the surface while weaving some deeper themes into the story. His characters, although outrageous, seem fully formed and almost possible in the real world of coastal California.But not so in ""You Suck"". Jody and Tommy Flood don't really seem to belong together, the Animals are just filler to move the story along, and Elijah comes off as more lecherous than threatening. Abby's character was a lot of fun, but the picture I drew in my mind was of that laboratory girl on the TV show, NCIS. And what's up with the Blue girl?Look, ""You Suck"" was a fun read but it felt like a weak sequel squeezed in between ""Bloodsucking Fiends"" and the future exploits of Abby Normal and the Blue girl."
4,Great Beach Read,"Great Beach Read: Considering I am not a fan of anything scary or vampire-esqe, this book was a quirky, humorous & enjoyable story about recently turned vampires in love coping in the world of the living and the drama that ensues. It reminded me of a funny version of the HBO show ""True Blood"". However, I couldn't help, but feel I was dropped into the story midway as I began reading the book; I later discovered this book is a sequel to Moore's ""Bloodsucking Fiends: a love story"", which I wish I had read first."
3,"Good book, but stick with it to see how good","So this was next on the list of a book club I belong to. And, coincidentally, the hard cover was only $3 at the local Borders, so I picked it up. When I started reading I smacked my forehead and said ""This is just a silly young adult novel trying to be adult with the 'F-Bomb' dropped around in it.""But I kept reading, determined to finish it. And I don't know what happened - about 1/3 of the way through it, I quit hating it... and by the 2/3 point I was really liking it.The characters are well drawn, if a bit one dimensional and the plot is fun but not over-complex. Much of the book seems to be filler, to be honest... but entertaining filler. This book is trash - but enjoyable trash in the end."
4,You Suck - doesn't!!!,"I'm a little new to critiquing things on Amazon, but Mr. Moore's story has me looking at the city with a new set of eyes.It's good to see some familiar characters return in new adventures, which continue to be outlandish but funny. If you liked Abby Normal from Dirty Job, you'll enjoy her in this.If you're not familiar with his writing, but you like Terry Pratchett, you should enjoy this book, especially if you're familiar with San Francisco.It's consistently a pleasure to read his writing"
4,Good sequel,"Read ""Bloodsucking Fiends"" in the late 90's - found it very funny (chuckle out loud funny in places) and have read it more than once. This is an enjoyable sequel that picks up where 'Fiends' leaves off. It continues along in the same fashion - funny. This makes the Sookie Stackhouse books read like drama. You'll need to read 'fiends' first before this one for it to make sense. Almost worth the read just for the title alone. Had a few folks raise an eyebrow when they saw this one peeking out of the top of my purse."
4,"Entertaining to read, but the first is still my favorite","This book reminded me a LOT of the movie, ""Back to the Future"". My analogy here is that the first installment in the series was amazing (""Bloodsucking Fiends""/""Back to the Future""). Although it was exciting to discover that a sequel was coming out when you didn't expect one, reading/watching it when it did was somewhat disappointing. The first one was so good, it could exist on a stand-alone basis and no sequel was necessary. But now that it has one, you have to read/watch the third, or you're left hanging, wondering what the fate will be of the main characters.I love Moore's books, but wish he had just left these characters be. Still, I recommend it if for no other reason than the ability to read Moore's writing again."
3,It's ok,"I really enjoyed Bloodsucking Fiends, so I was looking forward to this despite the reviews.Anyway, it's just an ok book. I didn't find it as entertaining or funny as BSF. One of the new characters Abby Normal has diary entries in the book and while cute at first, they quickly became annoying and a bit of a chore to read through. Her slang and pharses, i.e 'I was like and then he was like' were annoying. I realize that how some teenagers and even adult talk but that doesn't make it any less grating. At least for me. Decent book but I was hoping for better."
4,"Life on the Lower East Side: Photographs by Rebecca Lepkoff, 1937-1950","This is a book of photographs one feels truthfully captures the atmosphere, the way of life, experienced by the people living on the Lower East Side during this period of time. The text is a bit difficult to read as it is not a very dark print but all in all the book is worthwhile for just the photographs alone."
4,Superchick 2 please!,What didn't it remind me of! I laughed out loud as it struck a chord with the brilliant and honest description of the characters. I was sorry to get to the end that left me waiting patiently for Superchick 2.
3,so disappointed with the ending,"I found this book to be hilariously funny, and i just LOVED the sarcasm and humour in it. It was a great storyline and i fell in love with the characters. Being from Australia, I didn't understand a lot of the Irish sayings ""That's grand"" etc. But the book had me hanging out for more!The only thing i hated was the ending!! It was as bad an ending as those books that end with ""and then i woke up, and it was all a dream"".I was bitterly disappointed, and didn't feel that the character of Kayleigh came across to be a criminal at all. (which i know was the point) but still, everyone likes a happy ending, but this book left me trying to search for missing pages that said it was all a joke, and Kayleigh was ok!I really did enjoy this book, but the ending was so so bad, that I don't think I could read another of Martin's books, to save myself being left in pure disappointment."
4,Fast Read,It was a good fast read. Most people in my book club felt the ending was a good twist but I felt the ending somehow belittled the story.
5,A MUST READ!,"OMG, at times this book was so painful to read, I just wanted to cry and then I got to the end and the ending was nothing like I imagined and left me amazed. Don't finish this book right before bed because you will be up half the night thinking out this book (I made that mistake and am only 1/2 awake today). I won't give away the ending because that would spoil the beauty of the book. All I want to say is READ THIS BOOK, then READ IT AGAIN once you know the ending. This has become my favorite book of all time and I cannot recommend it highly enough!!!!!"
1,Horrendous,"I bought this for two reasons: I'd read reviews about it and people seemed to be raving over it and because there was a 3 for 2 offer at WHSmiths and I needed to pick the 3rd book.God, it's terrible. I'm not from the States so I can't really say about the dialogue, but come on. How ridiculous. The plot is basically surreal and I don't know any 8 year olds that are as articulate as Carrie.It's totally unbelieable. I wouldn't waste your money."
2,The last 3 pages of this book ruin the entire experience,"I won't spoil it for those of you who choose to read it but the ending of this book is akin to a murder mystery in which an unknown character is introduced in the last 3 pages and is the killer. Or a novel in which the author ends with ""it was all a dream"". It is nicely written, characters are well developed and it moved me to tears more than once so I feel duped, cheated. What is revealed those last 3 pages make everything that comes before it ridiculous, implausible, impossible. Flock has a real talent with words, I just wish someone had edited her and kept her ""surprise ending"" off. Without it I probably would have given it 4 stars."
1,What a waste-it was almost insulting!,"What a disappointment. This book was ridiculous, but unfortunately not to the point of making me laugh. The ""voice"" of the character Carrie was such a caricature of what someone with little imagination and maybe no experience down South might use-lots of ""ain'ts, cain'ts, reckons."" The plot was what made me pick it up; abused child trying to cope; however, I would characterize the book as like a ""paint by numbers""-so obvious. The minute the author threw in eccentric neighbor Mr. Wilson, who gave the little girl target practice, I knew what was coming and checked the end to be sure. As far as the plot ""twist,"" which was especially ridiculous since I don't think mama would have given much weight to the recommendations of a therapist, it has been done before, and so much better in ""Prince of Lost Places"" and others. This book was so awful that I wish I did not have to give it a full star."
4,I had a little sister too!,"The title of the book caught my attention first. As the oldest of 5 children, I thought the book would be about 2 sisters and I wondered if they would be anything like my siser(s) and me.When the book starts off with an 8-year-old telling the story of how wonderful she though life WAS when her daddy was alive compared to how life IS, living with her stepfather, I was caught up in the dialogue. I also had a stepfather. But the similarities in my own life ended there! The way Carrie tells the story of her young life was very interesting to me. I liked the surprise ending and now want to re-read the book to see if I missed some ""hints"" to the ending! Maybe not the MOST interesting book I've ever read, but a nice ""summer break"". I'd recommend it to my friends with sisters."
4,Surprising heart-wrenching,"I liked this novel for the writing style---from the voice of a little girl who conveyed, in a voice that was convincingly that of a little girl but had the heart of someone who knew there was something wrong with her world yet survived it by standing on the outside of it. I won't give anything away and I never saw it coming but I will say, I was surprised and a little disappointed in the twist. I had to put it aside for a moment to be able to continue reading the scenes with Richard and the hard-edged grief her mother took on after ""Daddy's"" death--it seems difficult to believe anyone could survive so much heartache, yet ""Me and Emma"" seem to tell their story in a way that is convincingly confident that all will be ok--their hope is hearbreaking--so...Flock must have done an excellent job in developing her characters for me to become so invested in their lives."
4,"Also read the sequel ""What Happened to my Sister?""","I made a mistake and read ""What Happened to My Sister?"" first. This was still a good book, even though I knew the ending."
4,Me & Emma,"Without giving too much away, the end was a little predictable with respect to Richard and I have to say, I'm disappointed about Emma, but it makes so much sense in retrospect and makes me all the more sad for Carrie. A very heavy read but a very engaging novel. I couldn't put it down. This is another story where so many knew what was going on and yet did nothing to stop it, but such was the time when people didn't make it their business. Carrie is such a strong character, and to be in her mind and see how she thinks...the author makes it her story tragic, believable and realistic. She is such a great big sister, taking amazing care of Emma through the entire book. The one person who cared for this little girl."
5,A Great Book!!!,"I would recommend this book to anyone and I will be ordering more of this writers books, she is an excellent writer. This book will keep you coming back for me and not wanting the story to end. There is a huge surprise at the end"
2,very disappointing.Exploitation of a serious subject for entertainment,"Basically, this is a story of horrific child and spousal abuse, for children and woman with no way out with no other redeeming quality. Mid way through the book I was able to figure out the"" big reveal""ending, which was not a big surprise.There is nothing interesting or new about this story in terms of literature.The only reason I gave it 2 stars was that the writer was able to convey the absolutely despicable and desparate situation in which the female characters find themselves, so the 2 stars goes to the writing style- but otherwise this is exploitation of a very serious issue for entertainment's sake. Very disappointing."
5,"An ""all-nighter"" kind of book......",It's been a long while since I've read a book that intrigues me so much that I just can't put it down. Make sure you have a good block of time set aside to read this one....it keeps you on edge. I can't wait to read more books by Elizabeth Flock.
3,Can't complain,"While this book left me completely puzzled at times, I did enjoy it for the most part. The ending was a true surprise for me."
1,Transparent Secret,"Like many others, I was intrigued by the ""spectacular finish"" promised. On page 16, I was positive I knew what the big secret was, and I let myself keep reading to about page 45, trying to second guess myself because maybe it was just too simple. Then frustration kicked in, and I skipped to the last 10 pages. Surprise! I had it all figured out and didn't need to suffer through the gruesome details. I'm a bit saddened by the fact that authors and screenwriters (this reminded me a lot of a big movie a few years ago with regard to the ""surprise"") feel that in order to have a big, surprising finish, they have to lay out clues the size of elephants from the first chapter on. It was just too obvious and since the subject matter was so depressing, it just didn't make sense to read it all the way through. Too bad. Initially I thought of purchasing her first book, but have thought better of that now."
3,Not impressed,"I was able to figure out the ""twist"" by the second chapter so I was not really surprised by the ending. While this book was entertaining at times I did not find the characters to be particulaly believable and the author's attempts at using southern dialouge were just plain awkward. The author Dorothy Allison did it better with Bastard out of Carolina."
1,Hated it,"Maybe I'm the only one. I rarely put a book down once I've started but this one couldn't get me past page 75. I hated the characters, the story and the writing and had the ""surprise"" and the ending figured out by then. Don't waste your time."
2,Well-written melodrama,"Flock is excellent at getting inside the head of her main character, Carrie. However, the places she takes Carrie will feel cliched to anyone who's ever read Southern fiction or seen an M. Night Shyamalan movie. You have the abusive, dirt-poor stepfather, the charming but feckless dead papa, the careworn mama, the kindly neighbors -- nothing you haven't seen. I figured out the twist about thirty pages in and spent most of the rest of the book waiting for my suspicion to be confirmed. (I'm pretty sure Flock cheats a few times to try to disguise it, but that could be defended as being a POV issue. She's also inconsistent with the timing of the backstory -- but, again, that could be a POV issue.) It was depressing going, and not so much worth it.It's not a bad book by any means, but you've seen it all done better before."
4,Engrossing,"I couldn't put this book down from the moment I picked it up. This was a BJ's Book Club Selection. I was surpised at the end. I don't know what I was expecting to happen but it wasn't that.Good Job, Elizabeth on keeping me in suspense."
2,So predictable!,"Unfortunately, I realized about 2 chapters in the ""big plot twist"" at the end! It is a well written book, and it almost makes the abuse sections all the more devastating, as the narrator is extremely naive in her view of it. I won't give away any spoilers, but I simply couldn't get beyond how obvious it was what was going to be revealed. (I also didn't care for the ""cloudy"" nature of the plot climax.)"
3,Kritters Ramblings,"Check out the full review at Kritters RamblingsThe first of two books, which kept me confused to the bitter end. Caroline Parker is growing up in a rough home with both parents creating a hostile environment and from the start I cringed reading about the abuse that she had to endure at such a young age. Throughout the book she has her sister by her side, Emma and without her she would be utterly alone in this sad situation."
5,Great book,"Very interesting book, takes you in and makes you feel like you really get to know characters. You just have to like Carrie, she is so good and tries so hard to be good. It is not a happy story so it might not be for everyone. There is a twist at the end I was pleasantly surprised that I had no idea that there would be this kind of twist! It made me stop and think about the whole book from the beginning! I would definitely recommend this book."
5,Couldn't put down,I could not put this book down. It had me addicted from the first chapter. It is an emotional book that makes you want to scream and yell at the characters in the story especially the parents. I became attached to Carrie's character so much that immediately after finishing this book I purchased the next book What Happened to My Sister. I recommend reading this book.
5,THIS BOOK PLAYED A HUGE MIND GAME!!!,"Emotionally charged, heart wrenching, mind shattering, and soul exploding...that is how I would describe this book. I am honestly awe-stricken at the author's ability to capture the mind of a broken child. This is a beautiful book that will remain imbedded upon my mind for a very long time. Saying that I loved it would not even begin to explain how I felt about it. There are not enough stars to hand out for this one!"
4,Heartbreaking,"Finishing this book made me as sad as some of the scenes in the novel itself did. Elizabeth Flock's prose flows like poetry. It was not always the easiest book to read, but a fulfilling novel to finish that left me wanting to know more about the characters in it, and also to pick up Flock's other books. I kept this book in my office to read while taking lunch breaks, and I never put the book down without relunctance, never picked it back up again without that little spark of excited anticipation to see what would happen to Carrie and Emma next."
2,I bought this book because of the great reviews...,"...and I was extremely disappointed. First, I agree with many others, the ending was too obvious. I saw it coming from the beginning. I won't delve further because I don't want to ruin it for the people that dare waste their time reading it. Second, the author's attempt to capture Southern dialect is horrible. It's so bad that, in my opinion, it distracts from the flow of the book. Third, Carrie is supposed to be an eight-year old girl, but she has the vocabulary and thought of a twenty something. I know this book is a work of fiction, but if the author wanted the characters to seem real (which I think she did) Carrie's vocabulary didn't fit that of a ""real"" eight-year old girl. Finally, overall the book was really, really, really slow until the last 25 pages. If the author wrote the entire book like she did the last 25 pages, I probably would've given the book 4 stars."
5,bookamania,One of the best. This book kept you on the edge of your seat. I've recommended it to my daughters and friends. A twist at the end that I could not have imagined.
3,Just okay for me,"Emma and Me by Elizabeth Flock was about two sisters, Emma and Carrie. Age 6 and 8. They've fallen upon some hard times. Their mother seems depressed and at your wits end and their stepfather is an abusive drunk.I thought this book was going to be one of those books that you finish and you say, WOW. I can't believe that was such a good book. I expected a lot more than what I actually got out of this one. Was it emotional, yes. Was it amazing, no.I was really into this book, I thought it was going places, and then it sorted of drifted into me just watching two little girls go about life. It actually got repetitive and boring after a little bit. Not to mention the ending that I really didn't like. Maybe because there seemed to be no growth.For me this was just an alright book"
5,wonderfully writen and probing,"this book is one of my favorites out of the hudreds i have ever read. in this book, carrie and her sister rely on eachother to withstand their stepfathers constant abuse and lack of a mother. when thier stepfather makes them move to a new town, carrie suddenly finds herself liked and popular. emma becomes more of a burden and less of a friend until it comes time to go back home.at home, thier dad is dinking more and more, and his abuse is getting worse. thier mother, already emotialy absent, becomes merly a shell. however the author shows in some parts the suprising extent to which the mother tries to protect her children.flock does a wonderful job of providing subtle hints at how carries mental and emotinal health are warped by her constant abuse. the ending leaves you wondering, but also satisfied. flock truly did a masterpiece writing this. :)"
5,Highly recommended,"If you are looking for an uplifting book, this isn't it. Rather this novel depicts the traumas of death, poverty, and abuse from the eyes of an 8 year-old little girl, Carrie. The author very adeptly made the characters come alive, so much so that I even found myself wanting to reach through the pages of the book to help this little girl! I became so involved with the characters that it was difficult to put the book down, even at 2:00 am in the morning. The ending was completely unexpected, adding a whole other layer of compassion to the story. In sum, this is an excellent novel, one that I would highly recommend to discerning readers."
5,AWESOME!!!,"This book was heartwreanching and beautiful the characters were portrayed wonderfully...everyone says that they had the ""twist"" figured out withing the first 100 pages THIS IS NOT TRUE this twist is undeniably the best surprise ending of any book i've ever read, and it does not become apparent until the last few chapters dont listen to other people. BUY THIS BOOK!!! $$$"
5,Good c.d,I liked this c.d because it has a good beat and the message is good. If you want this c.d go to bmg.com It has this c.d
5,Awsome Idea book,"This magazine is great for the cake decorator or bride to get ideas of some fabulous cakes to make. It isn't a ""how to"" magazine, it contains so many photos of cakes and chocolates, that you can get unlimited ideas for your own creations. I think that every cake decorator should collect these magazines."
1,This CD sounds like it was recorded in a trashcan,"The sound quality is on this disc would be laughable except that I paid money for it. Besides that, the track selection is really boring. I thought I liked hard house, but this CD has me wondering if I was wrong. Try Tony De Vit ""Tokyo"" instead."
5,The Best Read you will ever buy!,"This book has turned around PTS victims...IT REALLY WORKS! If you know someone suffering, buy it for him / her. I need to read it again - gave away my copies!"
1,Not Essential,"Even Queen completists can pass up this instrumental CD, which offers cheap-sounding ""productions"" of some Queen songs. There's no comparison to the originals, and even the Royal Philharmonic's ""Classically Queen"" was better than this low-budget ""home recording studio"" sounding collection, which is dominated by tacky synth sounds and obsolete drum machine patterns. One can only hope that the surviving members of Queen had nothing to do with this mess."
3,Good reference for Leaf fans,"Although there is very little writing involved, the authour did his work on this one. An impressive compilation of stats and tidbits about the Toronto Maple Leafs. Worth a pickup, but a bit out of date. However, if you are looking for neat anecdotes on the Leafs, look elsewhere."
4,Another nik-nak for my wife,"Very cool, but would have been cooler if a little bigger. She loved the gift, so my work here is done."
2,Dissappointing,They look better in the images here than they do in person. I was very dissappointed by their size and quality. They are not 4 inches tall they are more like 3 inches. Very tiny and not worth 25.00. These should be sold for no more than 5.00 a set as they are no more than dollar store quality.
1,Terrible!,I cannot believe that I bought these. I agree with the former reviewer that these are not quality-looking at all. This does look like it came out of the dollar store and I have been looking for a place to put them and they look good NOWHERE! I am either going to give them away or just throw them away. They are embarrassing to have around the house and take away from any sophisticated decor that you may have.
5,Small but well made and gorgeous!,"Sure they are small, but I wasn't disappointed, the ones I received were well crafted and nicely hand painted. These are cold cast resin, each one of the heads has a plastic tip stopper. These are perfect for small amounts of perfume or fragrance. These are also perfect for any kids project about the Egyptians. A great show and tell item. These are also popular with Rosicrucian members and folks who have an interest in Egyptology. I've never seen a poorly made set of these ever."
1,Ripped Off,"I was trying to replace two jars I had bought two years ago. They were 7"" tall and cost the same as these ONE inch jars. I should have read reviews first but they looked the same in the pictures. Boy was I wrong Totally disappointed. well my fault for not looking at the reviews. Not anymore. Just awful product. Plua the upc stickers were on the bottom and stuck to the sides. Pain to get them off."
3,Not worth 25.00,"Jars are VERY small, I should have read the reviews better! Still really neat but certainly NOT worth 25.00!"
5,"Thank you, thank you!","Thanks for the fast shipping! My daughter got an A on her assignment, thanks to these jars!"
3,Could have been better,"Not really typical of the series in that it is not particularly detailed. Whilst no records really exist of this vessel it is somewhat of a generalisation in its' line drawings. When you compare this to the fantastic details Marquardt goes into with `Endeavour' and `Beagle', particularly in respect of rigging, as such I find this book quite disappointing. Lavery does do good research and his history is impeccable, I still would have liked to have seen more detail in his drawings."
5,ARCTIC ANTLERS,"An enjoyable video on moose and caribou hunting, I love Alaska and all the open spaces and the natural beauty it has."
2,Don't bother,"I carried the speaker system around the world. At first, it worked well enough. After a month or two, it developed a buzz as if something inside came loose and the speaker buzzed at low and high frequencies. I lost it in a hotel room somewhere and didn't bother trying to retrieve it. Logitech made a looser this time.I replaced it with Sony speakers but they aren't much better. It seems that no one can make a portable speaker system that can handle international travel demands."
1,Gag me with a spoon...,"I had such high hopes when I saw these guys...then I heard the music. Insipid, un-inspired, pedantic...what can I say. Talk about re-inventing the wheel. Chin up backstreet...these guys pose no threat to the pop landscape. In fact, the fumes from the fake blond highlights on their jaunty little heads only add to the misery of listening to screeching attempts at harmony. But for the 8 year old in all of us...they are cute. Hope that's enough...if not, save 10 quid and go for Moby 18. Sorry....."
1,This is NOT The Starlite Orchestra,"Anyone searching for CDs by The Starlite Orchestra, a really fine, small (16 piece) 'big band' sound orchestra, will be disappointed by this one. Not a single song on this CD was actually played by THE Starlite Orchestra I was looking for. They all sound more like some guy on an electronic keyboard. If you're looking for bearable music of a guy playing songs that Frank Sinatra made famous, on an electronic keyboard, it MIGHT be worth a buck. But you will likely be VERY disappointed if you're buying it because you have other CDs by the real Starlite Orchestra, because this CD is either bogus or the guy playing the electronic keyboard on this CD has decided to call himself by the same name. Either way, stay away from this one."
1,a disturbing comeback?,"This book, reviewing all the accessible recipes for comitting suicide, was cause of a great scandal in France in the 70' and the subject of a law edicted in the french parliament which forbids not only this book to be sold in France but any medium giving tips or recipes on the way to kill oneself! How did it come with recommendations to me?"
4,Well-written,"Durant's book of 900+ pages is interesting, well-written reading. He is a gifted story teller who knows his material well. He does a good job of showing the human side of his subject."
4,Kindle conversion is a disgrace--shame!,"Durant's books have been, and will be, read for many years. He is a master historian who knows how to write commanding prose. But truly, what a disgrace this Kindle download is. There is a typographical/conversion error on virtually every page. Some make the text all but incomprehensible.Durant's memory is poorly served with this shabbily done digital conversion. Yes, I confess it's a lot easier to hold in my hand a Kindle or (in my case) an iPad than that heavy 900-page volume, but the conversion is truly reprehensible.Shame on the company who released this!"
2,Better than nothing...,"I believe that the reader from Greece summed this feeble attempt at a Georgian-English/English-Georgian lexicon quite well. As with most attempts, this one is bad. I suggest looking for the late Thamar and Isidore Gvarjaladze's dictionary. It is very rare, perhaps only 10,000 copies were made back in the 70s, but believe it or not, I have seen a new 2003 edition. Some things are inevitably wrong, but I believe this was a valiant attempt by the authors."
2,Let Me List the Ways,"The concept of this book was interesting. The Archangel Michael relays the coming of the second flood to Mr. White and his not-so-bright companions. Mr. White sets out to build a 20th century Ark out of an overturned barn.While there are some good points to this book, they are quickly overshadowed by pages and pages and pages of lists. The author goes on long winded tangents about what items are in a room, and what has been packed into the makeshift Ark. People in one small town, thinking that Mr. White is some kind of savior, attempt to follow him in makeshift boats. A 313 word sentence is used to describe the various people, their appearances, professions, and other stuff I could care less about. By the time I got near the end of this book, I was just ready for it to be over.If there had been more periods in this book, and less commas, I would have liked it enough to give it 3 stars."
2,"I wanted to like this CD, I really did","I wanted to like this CD, I really did, but I just couldn't. Andy Griffith is a good singer, who can rattle off those blue-grass songs making them just spring to life. The problem is that in this CD he takes a group of hymns and tries to sing them like he's an opera singer. His voice is good, but doesn't match this style. As such, the songs come off a little irritating, like when you sit in church next to a repressed opera singer.Worse, you'll notice that while the title mentions 25 hymns, there are only 14 tracks here. For each track he sings just a bit of the hymn, leaving you feeling like there should be more but you somehow got ripped off. It's very nice to hear old Andy singing again, and in spite of everything that does make this a pretty fair CD, but that's it, fair = 2 stars."
2,The Joys of Protestantism,"I gave this CD a chance when it first came out. Being a non-Christian, one would wonder why a guy like me would bother with it. But most of the hymns I was familiar with from my Baptist upbringing, and I knew that they could sound nice if sung right. Still, Griffith is not really cut out for this sort of thing. His voice is steady and not that unplesant, but it's just rather dull. You may like it if you are an older person and these songs bring back memories of endless hours of genuflecting in church on Sunday mornings, but apart from that, I see little of real musical value here. May be of use also to musicologists studying the evolution of hymns or something of the sort."
5,Enjoyable and Uplifting,"I rate this 5 stars for overall listening (and singing) pleasure. If you don't know these songs, they are wonderful, uplifting and meaningful. You will enjoy the messages of the songs and you will enjoy them musically. Andy Griffith sings in a relaxed, unaffected manner and the gospel harmony and instrumental accompaniment makes this CD a joy to listen to. If you do know the songs, the CD is even more enjoyable, because you will be singing along. This is a great CD and I feel great every time I listen/sing to it."
4,4 stars because its universal horror,"bottom line-draculas daughter stinks....son of dracula brings back late sat. nite 60's fright shows. if you love universal horror buy it-if not that big a fan...buy the wolfman, its the best"
4,Dracula's Daughter A+; Son of Dracula C,"Dracula's Daughter is a very nice movie. The plot is solid, and the actors and costumes really shine. The main actors in particular are all impeccable and fabulously adorned. The actors themselves seem to embody the true emotions of their characters. This is much better than the trite and see-through acting of many similar movies from the same time period. Dracula's daughter is also not gory or extremely scary, which seems quaint these days. I would give Dracula's Daughter 5 stars by itself.Son of Dracula is a fun movie for the period, but it doesn't seem overly serious. The acting and scenes are rather desultory - nothing too clever to uncover here. Of course, Son of Dracula is not even the first sequel after Dracula, so this is no surprise. I would give Son of Dracula 3 stars by itself."
3,wrong size,"Too wide for my acoustic guitar. It was loose and touched the back of my strings. I think the opening is about 2 3/4"" wide when flat. Hard to rate because I couldn't use it but it does seem well made."
5,Great Strap!!!,Quality leather & Great strap button... it is a perfect choice vs. screwing in another strap button on your acoustic guitar... I'd buy again if I get another guitar without hesitation!!!
1,It is not a strap!!,"I need to buy a strap. I don't know why but, it bought this thinking it was an actual guitar strap. when i get a strap I'll update my review to reflect how well this works. smh."
5,neat idea,"Why didn't I think of this? Is what it is and does what it says its does. From Martin, nuff said!"
5,Greeeeaaaat!!!!,These things are the greatest invention since the guitar! Wonderful for acoustics without a button for the front. Keeps you from having to tie a string around the headstock!
2,"Good Idea, But...","This is a great idea. I was excited enough to order two. Unfortunately, the leather is a little too thin and, even more important, the button is not deep enough for either of my straps. You need a really thin strap to secure it on this. I'm using one for my little travel guitar (thin strap). The other one is still in the package."
4,"Great on function, mediocre looks","I bought this strap button for my Yamaha acoustic guitar after realizing I had no way to attach my new strap. It fits my guitar well. It was a little tricky to button/unbutton, but at least I know it's on securely. I had no problems attaching my Planet Waves woven guitar strap to the button. I haven't tried playing yet, but it doesn't seem like it will interfere with the strings or my hands.The only downside is how it looks on the guitar. The leather seems to be a pretty good quality and it looks nice with my strap and guitar, but it doesn't seem to sit prettily on my guitar. I'm not sure if the loop is a little bigger than my head stock, but the button sits awkwardly off to the side. It's not a huge deal and it doesn't look terrible, it just doesn't look as slick as I thought it would when I purchased it.Overall, I'm pretty happy with my purchase. This strap button will definitely get the job done for me, and that's all I need!"
3,Dificult to put on,"Ok, I admit I am clumsy and not very dexterous finger-wise, but I think you need to have fingers the size of a pixie's with the strength of a blacksmith! It took me almost half an hour, yes, half-an-hour to get that tiny button onto the strap and I thought I may have damaged the neck and the body of the guitar a number of times because I kept knocking these parts in my struggle to get the button into the slot.Now, it may not be the button, it could have been the slot on the strap that was too small or the leather was too stiff, I did have to corkscrew a dull butterknife in the slot. But even after than it was difficult to get the button in. You would think with its rounded head it would slide through easily.Anyway, it's in, and I do know that the strap is never going to come off! And that's really good as the guitar was bought for a young child."
2,Didn't work for me on a slotted headstock Martin,"Purchased it to use on a 00-28 slotted headstock Martin and it just didn't fit well for me. Also found it extremely difficult to attach and remove. A string style worked a lot better, was a lot easier to attach and remove, and provided a lot more options for where it good be placed."
5,Martin Guitar Leather Strap Button,"This is hugely better than a string tie, and allows a strap to be put on or taken off from the headstock easily without fiddling with a tied string. In addition, I am betting that the soft leather inside will be alot easier on the finish than a small string, also. leather quality is good, and it looks good on a guitar"
4,the correct strap,"twenty words about this absolute item, ""20"". This item if you've ever used is the correct strap to use for...any guitar. for the price you can't do better."
3,OK for the price,"Got this for our ""starter"" guitar. It works most of the time, but if we move the guitar too much or hold it at the wrong angle, the strap touches the guitar strings and affects the sound. I'm not sure if the problem is the cheap guitar or the strap itself. Since we really don't know how to play the guitar (yet), the strap suits our needs for now. We'll probably upgrade to a better one once we can actually play!"
2,it doesn't fit any of my straps,"The pictures were very pretty but the actual product wasn't. Quality wise it looks light, still I think it'll hold your guitar well. It was quite surprising that even after trying hard, it coudn't go though my guitar strap hole. It's a standard size leather strap, so i refuse to blame that. The clip is too big for most of the guitar straps."
2,Does Not Fit on Planet Waves World Tour Collection Straps,"I purchased this to go with my Planet Waves World Tour Collection Strap, and this did NOT fit. I had to buy another leather strap button to fit. I recommend the Planet Waves quick release guitar strap button. It seems to fit with more guitar straps than this one. Save yourself the frustration of trying to grapple with large strap button and go with a more universally compatible one. This strap button is WAY larger than most."
4,Exactly as Described,I purchased this for my Yamaha acoustic and this product does the job. That's all there is to say. ...
2,Button doesn't have enough depth,"I was excited to buy this product, but upon receiving it I was disappointed. It fits around the neck of my guitar fine, but there is not enough space under the button to properly put the strap onto it. The strap I was trying to connect is a Levi Leathers strap, and I like the strap a lot. The strap ends are made of leather, and are not ""light-duty."" The end that attaches to the base of my guitar works fine, but the other end would not strap onto the Martin Strap Button. The button does not have enough clearance for the strap to sit in the groove provided. Could be good, but bad design unless you have a flimsy strap."
2,Eh,I have three cats. One of them will eat these but only half-heartedly and I find the remains of some left behind so they are not a big hit.
1,Worst product EVER,"Do NOT buy this! My cats wouldn't eat it, and within two days, I figured out why. I took it out of the bag, and there was MOLD ALL OVER IT!!"
4,Kawaii!,"This anime is very kawaii (cute).Of course it's got the normal perverted teenage guy (Tomokazu) surrounded by gorgeous girls. The poor boy even has a thing for his cousin Nanase.However, in comes Mone, a cute girl from Tomokazu's dream who takes him and his friend Mizuki to a strange world. With the help of Silk, a young woman in this dream world, and both Neneko (a girl obsessed with neko (cats) and who continually says ""No da"" (which reminds me of Chichiri from ""Fushigi Yuugi""), her pet neko Koneko, and Kuyou (Nanase's little sister fresh in from America), they may just save the world from the impending threat of the Faydoom (evil nightmares).The animation style is bright and cheery, and both the opening and ending themes are fun to listen to.I'd recommend this anime to anyone who's a fan of ""Tenchi Muyo"" or ""Martian Successor Nadesico""."
3,I only saw the first two episodes..............,"and they were okay, this series looks a bit predictable, maybe I should watch all of this dvd first......"
4,Darklands revisited in 2010,"I never played this game when it originally came out, but recently found it on an abandon-ware website (it's free / public domain now). The only reason to pay is if you want the manual, box, etc. I run it on DOSBOX and it works fine. For a game made 16 years ago, this one is really phenomenal. Huge map, tactical combat w/ pause, great story / setting, etc. While new games have better graphics and more complex quests, Darklands has a few excellent things going for it: your strength is also your HP / health, so when you are injured, you do less damage yourself and also cannot wear as much gear. Also, your attributes don't really increase with levels, meaning you avoid both becoming uber-powerful and crushing everything in the game, and also the obnoxious auto-leveling in games today where creatures scale to the party's level of difficulty. Highly recommended."
5,I wish we had one for every travel destination!,"We bought this book for my 6 year old before a trip to D.C. He had just started reading over the previous year, and he read it during the entire drive and during our stay. He was able to look up all of the sites we planned to visit, and was so proud to share facts he learned with us. It was perfectly targeted to a young child, and he has picked it up to read many times since. He did not actually complete many of the activities (he is much more of a reader than a writer at this point). I only wish there was a book like this for every one of our trips! I would highly recommend!"
2,"A Kid's Guide to Washington, DC","I am horrified that this book did not address the vast history of Afican American's in Washington, DC. No mention was made of U-Street, Howard University or Frederick Douglas' home in SE section of the city as places to explore.Parents, Washington is a great place to visit with your children come off of the Mall and find out."
4,Good girlfriend movie,"A great DVD to watch with your BFF. The highs and lows of Holly and Marina's life together growing up is so relate-able. First love and the broken heart that comes with it; rebelling; coming of age and finding yourself. the story focuses on the struggle for Holly to find her own identity seperate from her high maintenance, yet co-dependent friend.Great 80's punk/alternative soundtrack."
1,good movie poor dvd,"I saw this on the big screen 3 years ago and loved it. It was warm, funny, well acted, wonderfully filmed and compelling. I was really looking forward to getting the dvd. I couldn't find it anywhere locally except on Amazon. Luckily I was able to rent it before buying it. The widescreen aspect ratio of the original theatrical cut was 2.35:1 but the dvd transfer is only 1.85:1, however the opening credits is in 2.35:1!? The rest of the movie is cropped off at 1.85:1 and it looks terrible. Its a huge dissappointment not to have the entire picture on the dvd."
5,Terrific surprise,"I saw this one somewhat reluctantly and loved it. It really gets at the heart of complex, decades long, rocky friendships. The performances are remarkable and the periods details embarrassing in their accuracy. See it, before it disappears along with most other truly compelling movies."
3,Coming of age.,Two life long best friends end up having an affair with the same college professor and friendships are tested. Lessons are learned the hard way. I liked this movie but it isn't anything to write home about.
1,me without you,"the dvd would not play at all. would never order from this company again, because once trying to get a refund for this title, they were not able to be reached"
3,Me Without You Movie,"The product arrived in good condition, and it has thus far proven to be a good pucharse."
3,A P&P FanFic Fanatic,"If you seek Pride and Prejudice fan-fiction with a heavy religious influence, this story is for you. I enjoyed the story but am unlikely to read more of this author's work. The religious ministry, pro-life and abstinence themes may be appropriate for a tale set in a Texas small town; however, I found it to be a little too deliberately persuasive when all I wanted was some light reading material."
5,A HUGE HIT!,"Loved it loved it loved it.....I give it 2 thumbs up....just like the remake of the classic movie ""Parent Trap"" which was just as fun as the orginal....Debra brought this classic to life.....I can't wait to read all the others she's going to give us. Debra White Smith has a way with words, expressions, actions and situations that keep you involved and entertained. The only mentality that wouldn't like this book is the one who considers ""Clockwork Orange"" and ""2001 Space Odessy"" as enlightened classics. If you be that soul...you wouldn't like ""First Impressions."" But if you like to feel good after reading a book...this is the one for you!"
2,Trite modern Austen with a Christian slant,"I would only recommend this book for teens or young adults looking for Christian romances. For Jane Austen lovers, or people of other faiths, I'd stay away."
5,Great book! love this author's writings!,Debra White Smith has done it again! Thank you Debra! I love this authors writings and can't wait until another one comes out! She is one of my very favorite authors. There are few authors that I read twice and she is one of them! I will always keep her books around so I can read and re-read them! I have just finished re-reading her Seven Sisters books. Great job Debra! You did a wonderful job with this first book of the Austin series! I was so pleased how you handled the characters and the storyline! Can't wait to get my hands on the next one! Only thing is I lose sleep cause I can't put them down until I finish them! Keep them coming please! And the great thing is that Amazon has the best price for her books!
1,Save your time and money...,"I am a fan of all things Jane. I was thrilled when I stumbled upon this series. If only I had known they were ""Christian Lit"" I wouldn't have bothered. Nothing against the God-fearing and their books, but the new genre of pop-religious fiction, thinly disguised as chick lit is, quite simply, a waste of trees.I knew the book was doomed from the very first when the heroine (supposedly a literature scholar) is asked for her interpretation of the first line of P&P; (""It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife."") she replies ""What Jane Austen is saying...is that when a single man of large fortune moves into a neighborhood, the women in the community will assume he is looking for or in need of a wife-whether he really is or not.""(Wow. Thanks for the in-depth educated analysis.)My consolation is that I did not have to pay for these, and can return them to the library from whence they came."
1,If you love Pride and Prejudice -- don't read this!,"I found this to be one of the worst ""spin-offs"" of Pride and Prejudice I have read. By the way, it wasn't all that great as a modern romance novel either. The characters were cardboard and the writing merely mediocre. I couldn't even bring myself to finish the book."
4,TJH,"Really liked this modern take on ""Pride and Prejudice. Looking forward to purchasing other books by this author."
5,Excellent,"Hi,I bought this camera when it first came out, it has been three years, never any probelsm and still got excellent picture quality. I highly reccommend this camera if you are not looking for very fancy stuff."
4,It's what it claims to be,"I bought this disc after I found I loved Rhythm of Time and Feeding the Wheel. Prime Cuts is a great compilation, Jordan's vocals on Tear Before the Rain are lovely, the tracks vary from each other a lot. I'm glad I bought it."
5,A delightful story,A delightful story that took me back to that magical time when anything and everything was possible.
5,a step in pursuit of the truth of 1962,Please read this book to understand the truth behind the debacle of 1962. There is so little literature about this war out there that this is a must have. Well researched and nicely written. My only complaint is that the print is a poor quality and fatigue sets in quickly due to closely spaced lines.Very good content. Indians must be aware of the truths to avoid repeating the mistakes.
2,Where's Janis Joplin?,How can they pass this off as a soundtrack of this film without any Janis Joplin tracks?
3,Obvious omission,"I recently saw ""The Dreamers,"" and I must say the music is by far the best feature. The storyline is, in my opinion, pretty weird, but hearing Janis Joplin and Big Brother and the Holding Company several times during the film is just great. I believe most of that is from the ""Cheap Thrills"" album, but there are also a couple of extended riffs by Big Brother that are both good and raw power. If the CD had included the Janis and BB cuts, I would have given it a higher, perhaps much higher, rating."
5,Obvious reason,"I LOVE this soundtrack. Its eclectic and very representative of the film. And in answer to the previous reviews, perhaps the reason those songs are missing from the soundtrack are because the rights were not given."
5,"Wonderful book, wonderful edition","The work that went into producing this edition of Dietrich Bonhoeffer's works is nearly as impressive as Bonhoeffer's work in writing it. This is the fourth edition I have purchased (also Discipleship, Ethics, and Life Together), and the editor's forewords are always thorough, intelligent, and well-written. The copious use of footnotes rather than endnotes - there is nearly as much footnote text as Bonhoeffer text on many of the pages - is perhaps my favorite touch. These are definitive editions for the English-speaking world.This is Bonhoeffer's PhD dissertation and was written in 1930, so readers of his later works might be surprised that while he ended up a disciple, he started out a theologian. Even so I wish it were required reading for all people looking to blossom in their Christianity, as one cannot read his writings without being shaken up out of old habits and strengthened to do good in the church and in the world."
4,Character Building Tool,"If you desire to build character in your young kids, this is a very good tool to get you started. Short little lessons depicting common situations children deal with on a daily basis. A hypothetical situation is presented along with some questions to ask your children, a prayer and a bible verse. A good tool for teaching how to make right choices in a young life.The only negative is that the bible verses are from the Living Bible translation. I would prefer a more traditional translation for teaching memory verses."
5,A wonderful addition to any coffee table!!,"Those with even the most casual interest in the schooners and lighthouses of the Northeast will find this book fascinating. For those with a keen interest, the book is an absolute ""must have"".Having experienced sailing aboard a windjammer with Mr. Chillemi on one of his photo workshops, I can say with some degree of authority that he has a passion not only for photography, but also for the tall ships and lighthouses that dot the beautiful coast of Maine. Chillime has masterfully captured the grandeur. To loosely paraphrase an earlier reviewer, one can almost smell the salt air and wet canvas within the pages of this book."
2,Problem with unit,"Unit was defective from factory, audio volume was bad, I had to ship the unit back to factory at my own expenses, factory did not reimburse me for the shipping cost.I would not buy this unit again or any product from this company."
5,One of the best fantasy books ever!!,"Although I liked the first one better, this is still a excellent piece of literature. The characters are believable in both their actions and emotions. The plot and story line flow really well which makes it hard to put down. Its based on actual teachings of the Qaballah which makes it even more fascinating.And if the above review is correct, and Llewellen doesn't plan on publishing the 3rd book, shame on them. I'm going to write them today and find out. =)"
2,A little disappointed,"This book is much smaller (3.25"" x 3.75"") than I though and not as interesting."
5,Killer Performance,"For those of us that will probably never get a chance to see Landmarq live, this DVD is a real boon. The playing is stellar and Tracy's voice is spot on. The material is all mostly new stuff that isn't out yet on CD, so that's a bonus too. Lots of room for instrumental stretching out by the band, great sound quality and clear video."
3,Second Genesis,"Landmarq is a British progressive band that combines female vocals with extended, rather ornate compositions. Stylistically, this band resembles early Genesis. Most of their songs are fairly lengthy. Washes of synthesizer in the background simulate a string orchestra, while the foreground features an intricate interplay of guitar and keyboard. Lead vocalist Tracy Hitchings is not particularly melodic, but neither is the music. Her staccato delivery actually fits the material well. Guitarist Uwe D'Rose demonstrates some impressive technique, particularly in the solo parts. The band's main limitation is that many of their tracks seem to wander, often a bit tunelessly, while their musical ideas are sometimes too complex to be accessible. This DVD was recorded during their 2006 tour; a CD version is also available."
4,The gloves coMe off,"Enjoyed the episode, can see how in the younger generations as in many cultues through out the works the older generations struggling to maintain/ preserve customs and traditions ,Enjoyed the different personalities ..."
1,Didn't care for this show at all,"I am a bit of a reality show glutton. You never know what type of people are going to catch your interest, but this family and their outdated ways don't do much for me. I tried to watch a few episodes, but the drama just didn't catch me, and the shady gypsy fortune ways that this seemingly well off family lives kind of disgusts me.With so many other shows out their to waste time on this one falls short for me. . ."
2,Decent history - sloppy writing,"Sadly, I cannot recommend this book. I wanted to like it, and bought it because it is set in England in the 600s, an intriguing time about which little is written. However, the author needs to learn her craft. Such phrases as ""she gazed into the deep profound depths"" is an example of the sloppy writing. And I don't think I've ever read a book that has such awful point of view problems. The author flips from the mind of one character to another, sometimes several characters in one paragraph -- which makes for disjointed and unelegant prose. Although I'm sure her research was extensive, her abilities as a writer are not up to the task. If this book was edited, it certainly doesn't show."
4,"Sterling Silver Number ""23"" Pendant","Pendant was nice, material a bit soft, and chain too thin for a male..but it was still a great purchase and looks very nice."
4,Need more like this,"This book was recommended to me, and I loved it! It is not really a step-by-step ""how-to"" book, but really a narrative of how Debra has experienced and grown with her gifts during her life. I work with energy fields myself, and this is always an interesting angle for me. There are many books out there that tell you ""how to"", but I am interested in the stories of peoples lives, and how those lives have been shaped by, and in turn, then shape their gifts.Debra is in the vein of Myss and Brennan in that she seeks the scientific rationale of her gifts and that is the direction energy work must take if it is to have any credibility. GREAT JOB!"
5,Chuch Mice books,The series of books for children about the church mice and their misadventures are wonderful. They are begging to be read aloud and enjoyed by children and adults alike. We're into our third generation enjoying these books.
4,it was good,I thought it was great- i brought a mixed group in and we kicked butt- you need at least two mages I had a level 24 mage and 22 level cleric come in with level four henchman to see how much trouble we could get into- we lived- henchman are now considered level 12. it took 8 nights to finish with long nights of play.
3,An interesting adventure for us old time RPG fans.,"This adventure is the official closure of a picture any veteran RPG fan will instantly recognize. Most old time DM's have at least thought about making a dungeon inspired by this pice of art. It's TSR's art, and this is TSR's portal to a classic pice of FRPG adventure."
3,"Fascinating, but a bit slow.","This was a bit slow-going for me, mainly as I am unfamiliar with the history of Egypt during this time. That said, I did find it fascinating to read about the social structure and customs. The characters were interesting and it was a pretty good mystery. I wouldn't put it on the same level as Barbara Cleverly, but I shall definitely read another."
5,A great adventure,"People with some education and who like historical novel will love this book (actually every book that Amin Maalouf wrote is a jewel). Fast paced well documented and well written from the Spain of the Reconquista at the end of the 15th Century to the first half of the 16th Century's Vatican and passing by North Africa, this book keeps you dreaming, from the safety of your favorite chair, of exotic lands and times"
3,quick transformation !,"It is, a nice book written by skillful hands...thanks..however.. we should always doubtful about the the daily facts of the history...the history, has no backgrounds from archeology but the manuscripts, is a always questionable.. the very quick tranformation of a personality is the one the points lacking in the story..it should be emphisized gradually...nobody can do so well as bukalemun, even in that times..K. Gokhan Ture a reader."
3,"Good, not great","I enjoyed this book, but was also disappointed by it. Although Leo Africanus was certainly well written and researched, the very 'modern' attitudes of its narrator weren't believable as those of a man of the medieval ages. For example: he is opposed to religious extremism, and sees the shared aspects of various faiths. He treats slaves as individuals, not objects. He understands and respects the plight of women (the speech by his sister on camel-back was particularly 'modern' in its content). Overall, I was disappointed by how western Hasan/Leo was in his attitudes and actions. It's a nice idea that people have always thought the way that we in the western world (like to think we) do, but it just isn't believable."
2,yawn,"Hey! Wow! I thought to myself: anything written about such a fascinating character must be good. Well, perhaps something was lost in the translation (from the original French) because I must tell you although I can get interested in just about anything-including the local phone book-this book made for very bad reading. It was a total bore. Plus remember this is not a true story, but a non-fiction account made up by Amin Maalouf."
5,leo africanus,"This is a great historical based novel, about a person who really did exist. It is set in one of my favorite time frames - starting in Moorish Spain, then moving into other lands when Ferdinand and Isabel threw out the Jews and Moors. Enjoyed reading all of it."
4,History becomes a novel,"If you hate reading through endless history books but love novels then Amin Maalouf is the writer for you. Here he brings to life Lea Africanus the North African traveler. He captures well the final fall of Granada and the pitiful state of its Muslim residents, the unwilling expulsion and settlement in Morocco a country they could never feel at home in. His travels across Africa his kidnap in Tunisia being brought to Italy before his final return to his homeland.An entertaining read."
4,A MIXED REVIEW,"Leo Africanus is a difficult read in that the language is unusual and, at times, hard to follow. In many ways, the words seems more important than the story itself. The hero seems weak-charactered in that he changes religions and women easly as the plot, it seems, requires. The ending seemed unsettled in that the author seemed to not know how else to end it. However, the history and religious implications were fascinating. I would recommend this book but one needs a long time to digest it."
5,An AWAIR Pick !!!,"Fascinating autobiography of Hasan Al-Wazzan, the fifteenth century geographer who came to be known in the west as Leo Africanus. Al-Wazzan was born in Granada in 1491 where, with other Muslim and Jewish families, he flees the ensuring Inquisition. The story of his life is thus told against the backdrop of the 16th Mediterranean world - the fall of Granada in 1492 - the Ottoman conquest of Egypt - Rome under the Medicis. He is eventually enslaved by pirates, offered as a gift to Pope Leo X who baptizes him as a member of his family, offering him his own name ""Johannes Leo Medici."" This fictionalized journal based on his historic journal and records, was long on the bestseller list in Paris before this wonderful English translation!Teachers/Librarians; 7th to 12th grades - Social StudiesSee also Amin Malouf's The Crusades Through Arab Eyes and his full of surprises: Samarkand (Omar Khayyam, Central Asia - all things we need to cover in Social Studies) and The Titanic???"
4,"Good, but not great.","This book was recomended to me by a fellow I met riding the tube in London. He was reading Justine, by Lawrence Durell. He suggested Maalouf would be similar to Durell. Where Durell was rich and full in description and character development, Maalouf was thin. While I enjoyed the book, it lacked a certain depth and richness which I had expected. Still, I will read more of Maalouf."
5,For startups and small businesses,"This book was incredibly readable. At times, even witty. It provides a big picture context but, at the same time, puts business trends and examples in a context so you can see whether they are really applicable to your company or situation. As someone who runs a startup, too much theory can bog me down so I liked that each chapter also included practical applications and checklists like, for example, ways to rethink your portfolio or to reduce your vulnerability. I guess my overall take is that Strategic Supremacy has an agenda that is bigger than just promoting a new, one-size-fits-all business strategy. It makes it very clear how defined and yet dynamic any company has to be right now - and it provides a very practical template for breaking away from traditional thinking and looking at my business and my industry in a new way."
5,Nice upbeat christmas tunes,Three songs from this CD aired on the weather channel a number of years back. if you like nice upbeat unique sounding christmas music then this CD set is for you! Strongly recommended
5,A Must Have For DBZ Fans,OK OK So the movie might be a little thrown off but who cares. The movie is still great. If your into the whole japan DBZ (like me) this is GREAT.. Because you can watch the movie in its original format. Its cool to see the original over the american version. But then the american version has GREAT music. They have all the top bands like Disturbed and many others. The music goes great with this movie. So this is a must have! If you dont feel like spending the money on the DVD then get the VHS but i recommend the DVD because you get that cool little feature to watch American or Japan DBZ... So hurry up and order one already!!!
1,Pure Cheese. About as good as stale yogurt.,This movie was pure cheese. He does not go ssj and they show somethin like ssj when they didnt even introduce it. I wish there was zero stars cuz this movie is pure cheese.
1,Lord Slug,"This is probly the worst movie I've ever seen.I am die hard DBZ fan and I love every DBZ movie/episode even the (yucky) ones but this one is terrible. Stupid plot and no action. It is alsoexremely short. 45 minuets. That is 1 1/2 episodes. And if your have to buy it , buy it uncut. The cut one cuts EVERYTHING out."
2,Horrible,"This movie is bad. REALLY bad. The plot is very boring and it is cheesy. The rock music in the background is unbearable, and it is played throughout most of the movie. The animation quality was good. But, this movie is definitely not worth your money. Unless you want to see how bad it is, buy something else."
1,bad movie,"where to start.the one thing i liked is that dance with gohan and higher dragon.no what i hate.but this super sayian crap it is just a kaioken with no pupils maybe hes blind.and the super namek ha what a crop Piccolo is the only super namek.then no vegeta.and the way slugboy dies is gohan what a fight he goes ssj2 for the first time in the movies,J/K,Gohan whistles and goku not the purple fruity flavor aka.blinded kiaoken,just beats him.did i mention no vegeta oh yah piccolo pulls his ears off.the music sucked at least in the jap version they dont use as much music and slug is the only really strong villian i mean all the other fighters except the 4 others like the ginyu can be beaten by Chi-Chi.AND THERE IS NO VEGETA!!!!!!!!!!!never ever touch the movie just watch the frieza saga a least vegeta is in it."
4,Lord Slug - Much Better English version than Japanese!!!,"I dont know how many people have seen the Japanese version of this movie, but it was horrible. Hardly any music at all, boring, and makes you wanna go to sleep. On the other hand, the English version has great music that makes the movie much much better. I just wanna say that It was a big suprise to me how much better it was with the music. (...)"
1,And the award for outstanding mediocracy goes to..LORD SLUG!,"Wouldn't it be funny if the Toei Animation crew in Japan made a terrible movie based on their long running Dragon Ball serise and actually released it in theatres and then a overratted dub company called FUNimation actually brought it to America and managed to make it worse by pretending that it was a new movie even though it came out over 10 years ago and added a rock score worse than Transformers the movie...oh wait. IT ACTUALLY HAPPENED!! MY GOD!! This movie is for people who aren't allowed to grow fingernails. Buy this movie if you're collecting the series, but don't expect a plot, decent animation, a good dub, widescreen, extras, common sense, or something original."
2,WHAT THE HECK,"All the people who think this movie is the best is horribly wrong.This movie just [junk,] i mean, story line, plot, everything is just a mess, just slapped on all together. And the music is just out of there, it definetly does not go with the movie. Heavy metal music playing in all the wrong places. And Goku who supposably turns super saiyan is also [junk] because he lights up all red and his pupils disapear as he gets all strong. IT doesnt make sense at all. Even the extras stink, just a bunch of commercials. THe worst of the dbz movies ive seen( I am a die hard fan of dbz and have seen everything of dbz i could get my hands on and frankly this one just [smells!)"
1,don't get this movie unless your a tru DB/Z/GT fan,"the movie has the worst story and the characters were waisted. they could have had a better title for the movie becuase in japan the movie was called ssj son goku and that makes no sense to me at all considering he realy doesn't go ssj his hair just stands up i love dbz but this movie and movie """"the tree of might"""" run with each other for the worst dbz movie ever.if you dont like my opinion kiss my dragonballs."
3,a average movie,well the villan is a super namiken with some very stupid goals lord slug heard about the dragon balls to get his wish and out of the episodes and movies lord slug made stupiditsed wish to become young thats why it gets 3 stars
3,Rocking,"This DBZ feature has all the fights and action expected by the series, and to add to it has a great soundtrack with music no one has heard used with DBZ. The music fits the scenes they are in perfectly and its modern american Rock. Like the other 3 of the original DBZ features they take place before the Frieza encounter so dont look for the blond Goku and Gohan or the other saiyans, but overall it fits the series and doesnt destroy the plot completely. I give 3 stars for staying true, no more though because you can tell how its gonna end like always."
4,"English is an improvement, for a change.","While we already know this is the worst of the DBZ movies, I do have some very positive things to say about it. I first watched the Japanese with subtitles, and found it to be a very action oriented movie which seemed to be drawn correctly, but didn't quite seem to be written by the same people that brought you the series. I then watched it in the English language and was very impressed. Whomever translated this took a fan's artistic license with the dialog. Weak reasoning and poor direction from the original nearly vanished, and out came a more true to the saga movie.P.S. I believe Goku to have actually gone Ultra Saiya-Jin in this movie, not Super Saiya-Jin. For example, he powered up, his eyes went pure white, and his speed didn't appear to increase. The same happens when Brolly and future Trunks go Ultra Super Saiya-Jin. As in, they can become either Ultra, Super, or both. But I'm just guessing of course."
3,Not as bad as one might think,"Sure, it wasn't the best of the movies, but I didn't think it was as bad as most people tend to think. The lack of yellow hair when Goku went ""super sayian"" was kinda goofy, but beyond that I think this one is at the very least worth watchin."
1,This is the worst DBZ movie next to #11,I didn't like it because the animation is bad and the plot is stupid. Goku doesn't go super saiyan like it says in the japanese title for the movie. It is almost as bad as movie 11. ...Also the characters are stupid like slug the super namek. If you are going to bye a DBZ movie then buy a fansub of movie 6 or 8(6 is the second one with coola and 8 introduces brolli). But don't buy lord slug.
3,"Not so good, just 'cause it's Dragon Ball","I have this movie in japanese and Spain's spanish, and from the next movie, the #5 (Freezer's Brother: Cooler), starts the Super Saiyan scenes, this movie it's not as good as the Broly and Fusion ones, but it's good; at least u must buy it 'cause: it's Dragon Ball. And I was searching for Dragon Ball episodes and movies DVDs, and they're only availables at the U.S. not even Japan!! But I hate some DVD episodes are cutted, like the Dragon Ball Episodes 1-13 box set, ... And I hope this new 'Uncuted versions' Company will release the uncuted versions of all the 3 series and all the 22 movies of Dragon Ball, inlcuiding the Gaiden OVAs ones."
2,Great game but case is way to bulky,"This is a great game but I would not get this travel pack. The zippered pack is WAY too bulky for the size of the game. Also, the game doesn't sit flat because of the binding. My husband ended up ripping the game out of the holder since we were traveling with it and it was taking too much space in our carry on."
4,Pay attention to this album!,"I can't believe no one has commented on this album yet. This was my first introduction to Keaggy, and it is exceptional both musically and vocally. Apparently, Keaggy is more well-loved for his genius on the guitar than for his vocals. His voice is certainly unique. Listen to him once and you will never forget his voice or mistake it for someone else. His voice is appealing because it resounds with joy, confidence, and victory. The best songs on this album are ""True Believers,"" ""Be Thou My Vision"" (accented by his Irish-esque vocals), ""And On That Day"" (listen for Susan Ashton's lush, delicate vocals), ""Don't Let Go of My Heart,"" and ""Wildheart."" Those songs, alone, deserve 5 stars. The message of ""Survivor"" will stun and move you the first time you hear it. 4 stars is too low a rating, but 4 1/2 was not an option. This is not a perfect album, but it is incredible. Don't miss it!"
5,luvvin it,"This cd is the greatest for some house music, dj bam bam is a awesome dj and i think this is one of his best cds. theres a ton of hard house booty bumpin songs. I highly reccomend it."
5,Great for learning about mint and many great recipes!,"I purchased this book after I discovered a huge area of wild Mint behind my house. After searching Amazon, I found this book. I just got the book yesterday, and followed all the directions for drying out the mint. I also discovered that the mint in my back yard was ""peppermint"". I tried 2 recipies today, and oh what a treat! My house smells great now! I am especially a lover of iced tea, and sprinkled some of the wild mint in the tea, and it tastes great. Many many stories on tea, as well as recipies, and I recommend it to anyone with even a small interest in Mint. My wife is going to make candy next, she loves mint chocolate!"
3,Longer than expected and not as tulip shaped as pictured,"It can be hemmed, but it will change the line. It's really a straight, ankle length pencil skirt, not a trumpet or tulip. Also, it has elastic in the waistband, and that means it's really better for an 18-20, not a 14-16. If you run small, skip it."
4,How can this be?,"HOW in the hell can a movie these days be 90.00 dollars? It's not like it's different from any other horror classic--I wanted it, but I'll be damned if I pay THIS price--it's ridiculous!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,The sound isn't right...,"The pictures on these films are pristine, but the sound is way too quiet in certain spots. I had to turn the volume all the way up on one part and I could still barely hear it. This one was a bit of a disappointment."
3,Fun double feature,"These two films began pairing up the Universal monsters to maximize box office potential. Although the decline in quality is painfully apparent when you compare them to the first two Frankenstein films, they are still a lot of fun for anyone who loves spooky castles and torch-wielding mobs of villagers. Lon Chaney, Jr. makes for a sympathetic lycanthrope in both these films, although the Wolfman has always seemed to be a bit of a wimp to me as far as monsters go. Frankenstein's monster has been reduced to the shambling silent stereotype we know him as today. Sadly, the complexity of Boris Karloff's portrayal has been lost. In ""House of Frankenstein,"" John Carradine puts in a terrible performance as Dracula in a subplot that should have been stricken from the script. The highlight of ""House"" is Karloff's performance as the evil Dr. Neimann. He projects a malevolence that can make you momentarily forget that you're watching a safe monster movie that was originally produced for kids."
3,Good fun,"Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man is patchy, taking a little long to get going, and with a few lulls here and there. Still, it's fun, and it's nice to see Lugosi, having turned down the role of the Monster in 1931, finally step into Karloff's oversized boots.House of Frankenstein is pacier and more entertaining all round, starring Karloff as a mad scientist bringing the Frankenstein Monster back to life, with the Wolf Man and an appearance from Dracula thrown in for good measure."
5,"The best of the ""monster rally"" pictures!","The first, and best, of Universal's monster combos of the forties. Lon Chaney Jr. isn't usually put on the same level with his contemporaries Karloff and Lugosi...and in most cases, rightfully so. But his tortured portrayal of Larry Talbot throughout five Univesal classic monster films is among the most memorable and affecting in all of horror cinema. I do hope these upcoming Universal double-features don't skimp on the extras. Their first 8 DVD releases of the classic monsters have been first-class all the way! Keep 'em coming!"
4,great little read,"A nice bed time story . With a light touch of Sweden's culture,weather and a few main cities.A very easy read."
4,Back to my youth!,"After 50 years I returned to ""playing"" with my boyhood Lionel trainset. With help from my electrically competent son, it still worked.But I wanted ideas about layouts and how to set it up. This book gives many plans for many different room sizes. It also is most informative about the different types of tracks available, their merits, and the components that can be purchased. It is well worth the money. I'm young again!"
3,"Layout plans for toy trains ok, but not for fastrack","The information in this book is good, but if you've purchased a train with Lionel fastrack it isn't very useful for specific train layouts. It does provide great information on all the different track types, other than fastrack and has some good ideas for larger train layouts."
3,Not quite what I was looking for,"I thought it was ok- but his sunburned chest made me hurt to look at it.., not relaxing for Tai Chi"
5,dvd,Scott Cole is an excellent instructor for beginners Tai Chi. the workout is simple and easy to follow even for older students
4,encore performance,"This DVD is a great encore performance to His 'Back care,'and 'Beginners' DVD's. Excellant us of mirror image coupled with clear instruction. His teaching abilities shine through. Westernized style and flow is okay with me. Second half of DVD is stronger then first half."
4,Great for beginners,This was my first attempt at tai chi and it had me interested and excited about it from the first steps. Only flaw is that the narrowness of the routines (only a half-dozen moves in each routine) means I am ready to move on after only a few viewings. That is less of a problem if you aren't planning to get deep into the practice.
2,Not my cup of tea,"I'm sure this guy is good at what he does, but I don't want to watch a shirtless man giving exercise advice."
3,Granny's view,Video pretty good for older person. Would prefer background music to coincide with movements. Maybe use a chair to help balance for leg lifts and position changes for beginners. Will try other CD's from Amazon.
5,Great Selection,This is a great combination of movies. It showcases the variety of the films that Jack made great. My husband LOVED this gift!
1,Damaged merchandise.,When I received this shirt I tryed it on and it fit great. I washed it and 2 weeks later pulled it out to iron and noticed it had a hole in it. The hole was by the last button. Needless to say I was very disappointed.
2,Not that stimulating,"My son played with it for a half a day and never touched it again. It was too easy for him. He's 2yrs old. He didn't like to mix and match them either and it would just confuse him to do that. Eventually, all the pieces went missing and my little one likes to chew on them. It's pretty good quality given my younger (1yr old) chews on them and nothing fall apart. lol."
4,I just wanted a TV.,"This TV works fine. I purchased it through Best Buy because I wanted the TV on the day and they had one in stock. I have had it for 2 weeks now and it is still up and running. I do have some complaints though.1. I use x-box live and when I download a TV, half of my screen gets cut off. This might just be a setting that I can't figure out, but it still sucks. Other then that it works fine for games and television. Except for Halo 3 coop...I will have to figure that out, if I don't, I will buy another tv for playing games with friends.2. It gives off tons of heat. I am new to the HD big screens, so that might be the standard, but I was surprised. It almost heats up my room very quick.3. The packaging was horrible. The TV works fine and it doesn't have any cracks/scratches, but still. It has a protective cover for all the corners and some screen tape, and that's all.Other than those minor complaints I feel I got what I paid for. I would recommend this to someone else!"
1,Westinghouse tvs stink,I purchased a Westinghouse 2 years ago and the thing stop working. The customer service guy said that the back light was bad and there was nothing they could do. He said sorry but sometimes it happens. I asked that person to have a customer supervisor call me. I waited four weeks and no response. I emailed and explained the issue again. I got a canned response to call customer service again. These TVs are junk and there customer service stinks. I would never buy a Westinghouse again
1,Westinghouse product breaks - Company Does not stand behind its product,"I purchased a Westinghouse TV and within 4 months the TV was broken. At that point I called customer support and they were NOT willing to stand behind thier product. I asked if they found it reasonable for a TV go out in 4 months, all they said was that they could not help me."
2,Choppy aerobic workout,"There is cute music and people in this video but the workout is just not much of a workout. I did not even break a sweat or feel like it was even the least bit challenging. I felt that the movement were choppy and just didn't blend from one exercise to the next. There was some eastern ""OM"" type breathing and exercises which I thought were just weird. There wasn't much burlesque/cabaret to it. I thought it would be fun but it just wasn't all that fun in my opinion."
5,Too much fun!,"This is the first Yoga Booty Ballet workout I tried. My normal work out is 45 minutes on the elliptical and then 30 minutes weight training 4 days week so I am not new to exercise. At first I was a little skeptical about how much of a workout this 35 minute program would provide, but I gave it a shot and by the end I was completly sweating. It was a blast! I learned a few new moves and felt like I worked all the muscles in my body. Now instead of 4 times a week on the elliptical, I'm doing 6-7 days of Cardio Cabaret Burlesque and I can definitely see a tightening in my hips and booty. But the best part is how sexy you feel doing it How many workouts can you say that about?"
2,Ok,This DVD is for a beginner who is not used to dance fitness.The movements were totally awkward and not very imaginative. I like the instructors but this is not for me.
5,adam @ OR,"I have over 25 of Phil's albums, and I consider this one to be his very best. Why? The music focuses on Phil's family, his faith, and is at once soothing and appealing. Especially notable are the songs that are taken from other writers' words. Great examples of this are ""Could've Been Me"", ""In Every Need"" and ""Once I Prayed"". Of course, Phil's excellent guitar work is evident in abundance throughout the album. Phil's voice has never sounded better. This work will appeal to anyone who enjoys songs that are meaningful, but can even be enjoyed as background music. A must have for Phil's fans."
4,I actually liked the previous (cassette) version better...,"This is a beautiful album, but some songs are ""updates"" of the originals from the first release of Way Back Home (which was never available on CD, unfortunately). I was disappointed with this, but I'll still buy this CD--I especially love ""New Star"" and ""Olivia""."
1,Not Typical Keaggy,"I grew up on THE MASTER AND THE MUSICIAN, PHL'P SIDE, TOWN to TOWN, PLAY THRU ME...etc and love them. I also love newer Keaggy like 220 and Acoustic Sketches. But this album just doesn't have the energy I expected. If this is the only Keaggy album you've heard, try others."
2,Disappointed,"I have all but a couple of Phil's cds and this one was a disapointment. It has a sort of melancholy childhood effect to it, but I never listen to it. Find me in these fields, philip side, crimson and blue are far superior in all aspects. My opinion of course, some obviouly appreciate Back Home."
5,Finally,"This is an important document! And, it is finally available on DVD. Many of the artists that speak for themselves are now dead, so it gives us a chance see them in their studios again. And, it shows the Abstract Expressionists, Pop artists as well as the abstract artists of the 60's such as Stella, Noland and Poons."
4,De-mystifying the process.,"You smile when you watch these artist attempt to affix words to their work. It's a painful task, but De Antonio's conversational style turns an interview with even the most laconic of artists into an entertaining and instructive ride. (deKooning, 'Painters aren't so clever')."
5,Primo Unit,We hate paying for TV especially since it's available free!! The antenna is attractive as far as antennas go. There are tall buildings and trees where we are and were concerned about reception. We picked up more channels than we knew were available!
5,great product,"The shipment only took a few days. Took me less then 1 hour to mount the antenna on the second story of my house. I'm in the blue zone so I was just hoping to get a good picture. What I got was a excellent picture it does how ever needs to have the booster turned on, this was included in the package.I'm more then satisfied with this product, good bye dish!"
5,Awesome Product,"I installed this antenna at my aging sister in law's house and she is thrilled to see all the new programs that she is able to view on her TV. Product is well constructed, very sturdy, very easy to installed. The instruction manual is easy to understand and easy to follow. I highly recommend this product. I also have one at my house in the attic for when the cable goes down. I am able to see the local stations that are 10-40 miles away. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a high quality product."
2,"Nice looking with good hardware, but...","This antenna performed far worse compared to a homemade DB-4 with a Channelmaster 7777 preamp. On a positive note, looked great, with a great hardware package. I'm 40mi away from transmitters."
4,antenna review,works a lot better then the old rabbit ears and picked up a few more stations to boot
2,My old school UHF antenna works better,"I tried this antenna to see if it would improve my reception of a couple of HD channels which my Sharp Aquos would not tune. Unfortunately, it turned out that the reception was actually worse with this antenna than with the old-school UHF antenna which I inherited with me house.My impression of the Terk antenna is that it looks nice but feels a bit cheap. (It is extremely lightweight.) Installation was a breeze and there are tons of options to choose from in terms of mounting locations.The return process was easy--as always with Amazon. Someone said you can't close the sides of the antenna once you open them, but this is not true. If you look close to the hinge point you will see the word ""PUSH"". If you push there, it will release the arms and allow them to be closed.I ended up getting those missing channels by purchasing a Motorola signal amplifier. You can find that on Amazon too and it is amazing. I'm cancelling my cable at the end of the month!!!"
1,Not from my house,I installed this antenna on my roof to replace my rooftop antenna. It was not one bit of an improvement over my standard antenna. I live on Staten Island and thought I would get a good HD signal. I have returned the item for a refund. It did look nicer on the roof though.
1,Incompatible for certain areas.,"Based on the many rave reviews I ordered this antenna. Lo and behold I couldn't get a single station while with my old antenna I could get over thirty Miami area stations.A technician at Audiovox Corp, the supplier of Terk antennas, told me that this antenna just doesn't work at my location. How was I to know or Amazon for that matter? My advice is to check with Audiovox before buying this model.No reflexion on Amazon which has always given great customer service and make returns very easy."
1,HDtv Antenna,"We returned this product for a refund as it did not work any better than the regular antenna we already have. In fact, our regular antenna worked better than this one when placed outdoors (from it's previous location in the attic). This HDtv antenna did not work as well inside or out! Go figure."
4,Good product for the price,"This antenna claims to reach out into the blue zone, but I have trouble getting it to get channels in the red. Otherwise, the antenna captures almost all of the channels I need, and I'm 30+ miles from the nearest broadcast antennas."
5,Compact - Easy Install - Good performance,"Live approximately 16 miles from major broadcast towers in Cleveland area. Mounted antenna in attic with approximate 120' run of RG-6 cable w/3 connections along the way. Receive all major Cleveland digital stations (55 compass heading) with a signal > 90 (connected to Dish VIP 211 HD receiver). Picks up WKYC which is broadcast on VHF channel 2 with signal strength of 93. Also receive Akron stations (132 compass heading) with signal in mid 70's. Very directional antenna so final adjustments are important and yield higher signal strength. Mounting hardware is high quality and allowed a lot of different mounting options. Overall, very happy with the quality/performance of this antenna"
5,better than my expectation,I live in the Bay area California. I am able to watch all the free channels I expect. The amplifier is great.
2,Didn't work 23 miles away on VHF channels,"Tried this out in El Cajon Ca (Crest). Didn't work , maybe because of the hill next to me but I'm only 23 miles away and not even a poor signal. I returned it."
1,expensive garbage,"Don't buy.If you do, don't put it outside.I can't get diddly squat out of it and don't live that far from a transmitting tower.You get a poor pitiful 'power booster"",a box of screws and an antenna that is definitely not made for the outdoors. For the price you don't even get a cable to connect to your t.v. Not even a three foot cable. What a rip off. Rabbit ears are better and aren't always falling over.Believe me , I've struggled with it over two months now and have decided it's garbage.Maybe you'll have better luck."
4,Great Product and easy install,"Bought this product after lot of research, paid little extra and it was worth it. with this antenna, now we have over 50 channels with great quality."
5,nice antenna,the size is small good for anywhere especially attic. easy installation(comes with step by step manual). excellent signal reception(have to plug in the amplifier though). would recommend it to everyone.
5,Great antenna,"I bought this antenna about six months ago, and I am very pleased with it. I've never had such clear reception. I live in a remote area, and my reception over the years has never been very good, even with a pre-amplifier. With this antenna, my reception is remarkably clear.At first when I installed it and aimed it for the best picture, I was disappointed in the picture quality. I read the instructions and discovered you have to turn the amplifier ON. Big improvement.I mounted the antenna on a 15' ground mast, and I was a little concerned about the high winds in my area moving it around or changing its aim, but so far it hasn't been a problem. It's pretty stream-lined.It does have some plastic parts which may rot in the sun over time; we'll see. Apart from that, it seems well-constructed."
4,Great but a little to big,As the title depicts this antenna is really good the picture qualitly I perfect it's easy to mount but for putting in an attic it's a little big. That's my only complaint so far
5,Nice Tech looking antenna!,"This antenna was easy to set up, pick up more than enough channels, also the range on this antenna is great like some other people said in the reviews, HD channels come in very clear."
4,Works as advertised,"I set it up at our cabin 90 miles or so north of the Atlanta transmitters (in the heavily forested mountains in north GA). Pulls in five or six digital channels when conditions are right and the transmitters are not broadcasting on lowered power. Given this is way beyond the advertised range I'm happy with it, and I'm sure when it is mounted appropriately and closer to the transmitters it would perform very well. So why not five stars? There's always room for improvement."
4,Good Performance,"Terk HDTVo antenna does its job. Lightweight, small {compared to most outdoor antennas} and most of all, picks up what it's suppose to pick up- DTV signals. Amazon shipping is getting poorer and poorer; the box with the antenna in it was not packed properly."
1,Pure junk...,Don't waste a cent on this junk. It broke after 1y and the reception was bad. We live about 15mi away from downtown.
1,Does not work in areas where even rabbit antennas work,This product did not work for me. Barely gets 5 channels when my neighbor with his rabbit antenna gets 20 channels.
3,still switching between antenna and rabbit ears,I can get more channels but not always the best reception; depending on the day and weather. Still switch between antenna and rabbit ears.
5,great performance,"basically, you dont need to care about the position you put it and you can get every channel you need! Great performance, strongly recommand"
4,Good direction antenna,Does well for a directional antenna at this price. Terk quality and ease of installation is there.
3,extremely narrow range,"Does it work? Yes. Does it amplify? Yes. Can it pick up stations farther away? Yes.BUT....as others have said, this antenna is HIGHLY directional. The width of the path in which the signals it receives is much too narrow. I live just outside of Atlanta where the broadcast towers are grouped together within 10-15 degrees. This antenna barely has the strength to pull in signals from 35 miles away, but just not wide enough to catch all the towers.I highly doubt this antenna will last one or two decent storms. The base of the fold-out wings are made of brittle plastic as is the body too. If you plan on putting this in your attic or under an awning, then it may work for you. This didn't work indoors for me; I have vaulted ceilings so an attic mount is not an option.I had high hopes for this antenna. Unfortunately, its narrow range and cheap materials were simply not worth what I paid. Amazon's customer service and return policy are absolutely amazing."
5,Long range for a small antenna,This antenna is a great product. We live about 50 miles from broadcast antennas in Oklahoma City and there are trees surrounding my house. Even with the antenna mounted in the attic (2 story house) I pick up about 25 stations.
2,Careful before buying,"This antenna only picks up very few stations in my area than only under ideal weather conditions. Says it is good for so many mile from station but buyer beware, this is not what it is supposed to be sorry I bought it."
2,No luck with the item,I bought the Terk HDtv hoping that would be a good investment but i had no luck with the item.. I also bought a Phillip's multi directional HD antenna that had more channels than the Terk HDtv.. The Terk HDtv is very uni directional if a fly lands on it then you are out of luck..LOL!!!For the price of the Terk HDtv you can buy two of the Phillip's HDtv and i had great reception. I had the phillip's Hdtv up in the attic which had three more stations...You must try it yourself to really see the outcome of the product. It depends on location location location.
2,Works like a champ,45 miles from towers 175 degrees recieving all channels 16 each. Did not think the tower at 41 degrees would show up on this directional antenna. We are recieving 3 channels from that direction also. Could not be more satisfied with the product.
5,Works great north of Baltimore!,"I bought this antenna becuase we are thinking about getting satellite for our television, and why pay for channels when you can get them for free? I live about 35+ northeast of the broadcasts. I installed the antenna quite easily in my attic. The analog channels do not come in well; however, the digital channels come in perfect. I would recommend this to anyone!"
4,Terk HDtv Antenna Amplified,Purchased this antenna to replace a failing one on my father-in-laws home to address the arrival of digital TV changeover. Had tried an earlier circular model that did not work at all. The Terk however was very easy to install and immediately picked up about 90% of the signals we could expect based on a readout of the broadcast spectrum for our area (about 55 miles from NYC out on Long Island. The antenna was sturdily built and a breeze to install. Would highly recommend.
3,Not as good as expected,"I purchased this antenna based on some good reviews, and for its cool looks, but returned it.After installing and aligning Terk HDTVo antenna per instructions on [...] I had signal strength in 70%-90% range. The 70% channels worried me, because any interference could cause a loss of signal on those.I saw that my neighbors had a Winegard GS-1100, and I decided to try that antenna [...] Winegard GS-1100 is 1/3 of the price of Terk HDTVo and I have all channels in 90%-100% range. Later, I purchased two more GS-1100 for my relatives - all satisfied.The worse performance of HDTVo or better performance of GS-1100 may not be the case for everyone, but it worked in my locations: Duarte, CA and West Hollywood, CA."
5,Excellent Antenna,"Good reception in the mountains of Candler, NC. Antenna is mounted inside the house. Works well with the CM-7000 PAL DVR."
4,Works great for UHF and acceptable for VHF,"Works great for all UHF digital channels but not as good for VHF digital channels (ch 7-13). Never-the-less, it's better than paying for cable and pays for itself in just one month!"
1,No Good,I spent hours trying to pick up more than 3 stations and only one of the three was a network (NBC). Went out and bought an $80.00 radio shack directional antenna and emmediatly was able to pull in 5 major networks and 4 local channels.
5,Works Great in Lawrenceville Georgia!,"This antenna installed easily in my attic. I simply put in on the side of the house that was perpendicular with I-85 South and pointed it towards Atlanta. I get a crystal clear picture and 100% strong signal on all local channels. I even picked up channels that I did not know existed. The picture is better than cable or satelite and does not appear to be affected by weather. Since I mounted it inside the attic, I don't have to worry about it's position being changed by weather either. Great Product. Great Value. 100% recommended."
4,Good outdoor antenna,"We bought the HDTV converter box first and used it with the antenna we had which was in the upstairs of our house. We got several more channels but had a problem with the digital signal coming and going. I ordered the Terk antenna and my husband installed it at the top peak of the outside of our house. We haven't had any problem with the digital signal coming and going like it had before. We aimed the antenna the direction of most of the stations but on some days we even get a few channels from the opposite direction, almost 50 miles away. I chose this antenna because of the reviews I had read online and so far I am happy with it."
4,convenient and effective,"I installed this antenna in my attic to use as a supplement to my DirecTV HD service (a few local HD channels are not carried by DirecTV), and also to provide a digital signal to a small TV in my office.It was easy to install (luckily, from my house, all of the stations are in the same general direction), and works great. I am in the city, along with all of the stations, so the longest distance isn't more than 10 miles, but plenty of interference sources. All of my signals are excellent.If you are more of a distance from the city, or need something that can be pointed more conveniently, you'll want to look elsewhere. But for a simple antenna for local HD, this is a great choice."
4,Very Good Electric Strings,"The D'Addario half-round jazz light strings sustain well, are available a a good price (considering that half-rounds generally are more expensive), and have a nice even tone. I've tried these for a jazz sound, for blues, and for distorted blues-rock, and they work very well and hold their tuning quite well. There is, however, a caveat... Part of the reason they hold their tuning is that the G string is wound (as per steel acoustic guitar strings). Using the standard blues ""box"" fingering position, this is the string that you basically want to be easy to bend (the fourth above tonic up to the flatted fifth); however, that is much tougher to do with jazz strings than with standard round-wound electric strings. Still, for basic feel, depth and consistency of tone, these are highly recommended."
4,crow vs moorer,judge for yourself. try playing both versions (version 3 with mooror) of picture simultaneous. kid rock sounds the same but moorer has a different cleaner more fluent style than crow. i dont know about chemistry but i find the moorer - rock picture better than crow - rock picture. but separate i like them both.
3,KID ROCK & SHERYL CROW,"THIS SONG (PICTURE) SHOULD ONLY BR SUNG BY KID ROCK AND SHERYL CROW, THE MAGNATISM BETWEEN THOSE TWO IS ELECTRIFYING. I WASN'T A KID ROCK FAN UNTIL I HEARD PICTURE, I DEVELOPED A NEW RESPECT FOR HIM AND HIS MUSIC. ROCK SHOULD BE WITH CROW, ON AND OFF THE STAGE."
4,where is the sheryl cd!!!!!,"This is a great song, but.....Please, it says everywhere that people want to know where the cheryl crow version is, please, pretty please, tell us!!!"
5,Sweet,This and Only God Knows Why are the best country songs I've ever heard OGKW is considered rock but its really country
4,A Blues Song,"This is such a beautifel song.It reminds me of And I Will Always Love You.One of those I'm really hurting song 'cause I don't have my hony any more,and I just want to be left alone depressed in my room,and drinkning."
5,Better Version,"Cheryl Crow is a FANTASTIC talent! But let's face it she's no Allison Moorer. When I saw this on live TV (Farm Aid) it blew me away! Allison's voice is always full of emotion. Kid Rock has that Detroit rough edge. The combination makes for a great country song. The Crow & Rock version is smoother and more radio friendly. If you are only going to buy one version, THIS IS IT!"
5,One of the best songs I have ever heard,"What an excellent song, I have tears in my eyes when I listen to it. One of those songs that sums up life. Can listen to it enough!!!!!"
1,Buy the Canadian release,"I have both releases- a friend bought me this one and I purchased seasons 3&4 from Amazon.ca- and the Canadian release is better. The American release is cheaper, and looks it. The sound and video quality is bad, four episodes are missing, and they slapped David Mercano all over it. If you're a RayK fan, which you'd pretty much have to be in order to be looking to buy season three, the Canadian release is better."
4,Gets the job done,"I have been a big fan of Due South since it first aired on television. With the U.S. version of the DVD's though, don't get your hopes up when it comes to any extras because there aren't any. The discs are about as plain as they come. So as long as you aren't expecting anything other than the show itself, you won't be disappointed. The picture quality is the same as when it first aired on television. Other than that, the DVD's came out fine, just check to make sure nothing is wrong with the discs as some of them tend to shift during shipping.I have heard that if you can afford it, get another country's version of the sets, such as the Canadian version, because it has better picture quality and it actually has extras on the DVD's. I would have given the DVD's a five star rating had it had extras."
4,due south season 3,"tried to watch disc #2 tonight and it has no data on it! It won't load. My son said it doesn't look damaged, but it probably didn't get loaded at the factory. I have to send it back. Is anyone else having that problem? I was just getting ready to watch Bounty Hunter! How upseting!"
2,Avoid at all costs!,"If you enjoyed Seasons One and Two, do not watch Season Three. It has a few decent episodes towards the end of the season but, for the most part, it is painful when compared with previous seasons. The ""Chicago"" detective with a Canadian accent (who replaced David Marciano/Ray Vechio) makes it particularly hard to swallow."
2,Disappointing,"On the basis of Paul Gross's work in ""Slings and Arrows"" (which I highly recommend), I plunked for all three seasons of this series. It's not bad, exactly, just not especially good either: the writing especially seems kind of pedestrian. The dynamic between the straight-arrow Mountie and the semi-slacker American detective seems forced, and the crime situations look like recycled ""T.J. Hooker"" episodes."
3,Due South - Seasons 1 to 3,"I was excited to hear that I could purchase the Due South TV Series on DVD through Amazon since it was unavailable here in Australia (& since my VHS tapes were showing disintegration from the many times I was watching them!)For Seasons 1-2, I was disappointed to find the packaging format was quite poor and there wasn't anything by way of DVD extras (not even out-takes). I also had problems with reading a couple of episodes even after attempting to clean the DVD disc surface.When I purchased Season 3, I was also disappointed to find that it really only had half the number of episodes that make up a normal season, thereby forcing viewers to have to purchase the second half (and given the AUD$ exchange rate, does end up being quite expensive).The only redeeming feature for the Season 3 release was that the episodes were not double sided this time around and they were properly labelled.Overall, I'm just happy to have my own copies of the TV series that I enjoy immensely."
3,"Season three, *all* of it","Ignore what the cover looks like, this is season three with CKR as Ray (Kowalski). And it's season three the way those of us in the US saw it, as one big season, not broken up into two seasons.Once again, don't go looking for anything in the way of features; it's just the episodes and the quality could be better. But for the money and for the chance to finally have the season the way you saw it instead of having to buy two seperate sets, it's well worth getting."
5,"Hang in there fans, better deal on Due South elsewhere!","I'm a faithful amazon customer but they've messed up on this one. Check your local Best Buy store, ya gotta buy it in the store, not online. Found seasons I and II there recently, both approximately $20. Season 3 will show up at Best Buy, found out today, on 8/9/05, again at around $20, nice quality package, sounds better all around than what you get for the higher price. Good DVD quality put out by Platinum Disc, LLC. Love this show, by the way, and am thrilled to have it on disc to watch anytime."
5,It,"It was hard to choose between a 4 and a 5. Although it provides many different meanings and is very well designed, I find that it includes many words that people would rarely use in Spanish like condom, penis, and other such unnecessary words when other more important terms are not included for my knowledge gaining. I believe that this dictionary is the cream of the crop for non-natives like me."
5,For the money excellent!,Looks very nice with different types of bottles in it. Extremely easy to put up and looks great on the wall!
5,Way Better than Photo,"Better than advertised. This wine rack is very well made. Not only is it beautiful, it is well constructed. I was worried about the wall mounts, but they are welded on. I was able to hang it where there is a stud in the wall, so it ain't coming down! If you only have sheet rock available, be sure and use a molly, not just a nail. It really is beautiful. Not only that, but all shapes of wine bottles that I tried, fit well in the rack. I took a picture and will try to upload it as well, if I figure out how to do that.Gary R"
5,Canibus is back...........,"With his 4th album feat Kool G. RAP , Jedi MIND tRicks and more. Production is top notch. If anythingthis album is the most lyrical HipHOP album ever, and the beats complment it perfect. If u sleep on this it's your loss, 4REAL! Canibus just gave HIPHOP a classic album for the ages!"
5,The realness,"What happened to Canibus. Where was this during this hip-hop drought when ""rappers"" like Ja Rule and Nelly was destroying the game with simplicity. This will never see 5 mics in the source because they associate skliis with sales and reputation. I must say that the hardest track on this album is Liberal Arts. I am glad a hip-hop album has came out in 2002 winter season. This is real, bottom line!!DamifacooloA Haiyan of Hip Hop"
5,the man-eater in a wife beater is back!,"this new album is hot. canibus is back. this is his most impressive lyrical acheivement yet. make sure you buy this, ecspecially if you appreciate wicked bars, and ""the canibus man"""
5,No Chorus,"If you don't like hooks and chorus and enjoy pure rap, this album's for you. This is an emcee not BSing w/ commercial ish. Pure lyrics. Due to complex lyrics, this album isn't meant for uneducated individuals. If you're smart and like rap, cop this album! Let the mind stimulation begin."
5,CanIbuS is The HipHop King!,"This album is a HipHop classic! Now I can ""C"" why Eminem duked BIS from the live battle! CanIbuS keep droppin Classics like MICCLUB, 2000B.C., and Can-I-Bus!"
5,one of the best,"Canibus has had a varied career. after the disapointing c true hollywood stories, canibus drops micclub out of nowhere. ALl i can say is the the beats are good enough to enjoy, but nowhere near as dope as rip the jacker. as far as the rapping goes, bis spits countless bars without rest.creative lyrics are adorned throughout the album, and many songs will just leave you speechless. the only problem is that most are too stupid to understand these raps. their not for the genius,just average intelligence and up. anyone who doesnt appreciate this album is just too frusterated with their intelligence to listen"

3,Jedi Mind Made This CD,"This CD is not bad, but it has some bad moments. The lyrics are better than the last one, but a lot of the beats are still not upto par. I know Bis can spit harder. He should learn from Vinnie Paz, who out does Bis on the song Liberal Arts. If you are a die hard Canibus fan you will like this cd."
2,Good,"Canibus has better ones like his debut, and rip the jacker, but its a decent cd all the same though."
1,Censorship?,"I have ordered lots of used books, but this is crazy:The original owner of this book had crossed out all ""bad"" words with a black magic marker!That may be the original owner's personal testament to language he/she finds offensive, butdefinitely is a distraction to smoothly reading this book by others.It should not have been resold.To me, at least, it's disgusting to have a book that has been altered."
1,Cannot believe that Adler wrote this,This book is so bad that I can't believe it is written by Adler. It has no style at all. A very insipid story. Cannot be compared with 'Legacy of Secrets' ('Present of the Past')
3,Glaringly average thriller about greed and murder,"Elizabeth Adler's ""Secret of the Villa Mimosa"" tries to combine romance with a thriller, and it works as neither. Dr. Phyl Forster is drawn to a ""Jane Doe"" who has amnesia. She is named ""Bea French"" by the doctor, mainly because she could speak French fluently. Then, Phyl tries to restore the woman's memory, while keeping detective Franco Mahoney at bay. We know instantly that these two will become close, as both try to discover who almost killed ""Bea."" Then, Bea gets a job with a rich French socialite, and start having her memory jogged in France, while Phyl has a chance meeting with Brad Kane, a rich Hawaiian with a terrible secret. The thriller unfolds as the reader is keyed into the connections between the Kane family and Bea, and the reader starts to feel that things would have added up quicker if Bea and Phyl had talked more in the second half of the book."
5,This is a home run by one of America's premere leaders.,"Long-time leader and professor at Dallas Theological Seminary has written a volume that takes church leadership to new frontiers. . Pelted with quotes by notables (Drucker, Bennis, Nanus, et al), the author, with characteristic lightening flashes, tackles subjects such as personal and organizational creativity, leadership and family principles. Let this generation of Christian leaders rise up and call Hendricks blessed!! Five Stars!!!"
3,Creativity to move beyond status quo,"Howard G Hendricks, Color Outside the Lines: A Revolutionary Approach to Creative Leadership (Nashville: Word, 1998)Against roadblocks to innovation, Hendricks fosters holy discontent with the status quo and encourages fresh creativity and ideas. He outlines practical methods like brainstorming, mind-mapping, storyboarding and mind maps to help leaders reflect the image of the Creator and unleash new ideas. He argues creativity is biblical and necessary for our world. Emerging churches pride themselves on innovation, and this book though not written from or for the emerging church, has some good practical strategies emerging churches may appreciate.Originally reviewed for D Cronshaw ""The Emerging Church: Pioneering Leadership and Innovation Reading Guide"", Zadok Paper (Forthcoming 2010)."
5,Sumptuous and sacred,"Duquesne's collection of world-renowned masterpieces depicting the life stages of the Blessed Virgin Mary and accompanied by his well-crafted essay is a delight to the eye as well as the theological mind. He begins with the story of her parents, Sts. Joachim and Anne, and chronicles Mary's life through her death, Assumption into heaven, and, finally, her magesterial role in Christianity.The paintings by famed painters such as Caravaggio, Raphael, and Michelangelo, are neatly paired with works of lesser-known artists, such as Pierre Prud'hon, Simone Martini, and Jan Provost (at least, the latter three were unknown to me until I beheld this tome). Duquesne's script is theologically sound and full of interesting Marian facts, delivered in a reverential but not pietistic tone. I enjoyed this book tremendously."
4,STRONG TRIP TO HEAVEN,"Mr. Chapman garnered his first big seller with HEAVEN IN THE REAL WORLD. It's a heavily pop-oriented offering with Chapman's usual spirited and sincere vocals and top-notch musical accompaniment. Most of the tracks are decent...I'm not too fond of DANCING WITH THE DINOSAUR or BURN THE SHIPS. The best tracks: The title track; THE MOUNTAIN, LOVE AND LEARN, REMEMBER YOUR CHAINS, HEARTBEAT OF HEAVEN, and FACTS ARE FACTS. These songs represent the strongest elements of SCC's musical skills. Chapman maintains his iconic status in contemporary Christian music and this album served as his launching pad."
4,Great Music,"Such a wonderful blend of music. Some songs are fun to listen to and others are very meaningful and thought-provoking. Steven is an amazing writer and God has blessed many people through the songs that he has written. This CD is no different. I can't say it will change lives, but even if it doesn't you've listened to some pretty good music."
5,It's nice,"Bought this filter for my 10gal aquarium. Fits nicely.You need an air pump for this so don't get one if you don't have it.The filter works. Keeps all the heavy stuff underneath the gravel.You cant see it working, but when you clean you aquarium and look you will be surprised how effective it works.Also the clear tube in which the bubbles flow through make my aquarium seem futuristic, by that i mean it looks nice.It comes with a ""filter"" that has some carbon pellets or something, after a while mine got filthy so i tossed it.This filter system doesn't need that filter at all. It's all about the bubbles making a soft undertow to pull the trash under the gravel. I think it's good and worth the price."
5,Great product at a great price.,"Better than expected product. Service delivery was fast, easy and uneventful. You couldn't ask for more!"
3,Does the job.,"I bought two, one for work and one for home. long enough to reach everywhere. Little wheels on the handle end don't seem particularly useful - small and loose, and no leverage to work into muscles. teeth are uneven, one scratcher is missing a tooth the way the teeth were cut in. They get the scratch, though ... that's the point. :)"
5,Back scratcher,Very nice product really. I was kind of suprised by how well made it is. I was not expecting it to be very well made.
3,Diamond in the Rough,"Like other reviewers have said, this is pretty rough when you get it. It needed some (aggressive) sanding and a little cutting on one of the ""fingers"". I did have to drill a hole for hanging. But, after all that, it was worth it. This thing is long enough to scratch the whole back. I would buy again."
1,Very badly made!!,"The shoe horn end of this back scratcher has a 4"" split in it and in addition would have to be completely sanded to be useful. Every surface is covered with slivers. My old favorite, beautifully finished, bamboo back scratcher was lost in moving and I was hoping to get something at least near to that, but there is no comparison here. Too cheap to send back, but obviously, you get what you pay for."
1,There is no way anyone would give this any stars unless they are getting paid.,"It's not even what is pictured for one thing...it has SPLINTERS for another, it is overpriced...it is just an absolutely terrible product, I would avoid it."
2,So-so,"I do agree with some of the previous reviews. They could have made it a bit more ""scratchy"". It is very smoothe, so it's more a ""rubber"" than a scratcher. It's OK though."
1,You get what you pay for,This back scratcher is of poor quality. It only vaguely resembles the picture shown. I would gladly pay 3 times as much for a good quality back scratcher. This one was promptly returned.
2,Complete Reference? Sort of...,"Based on the title of this book, you would think it would have some real content. After reading the first part of this book, I was deeply disappointed. I think this book is great for project managers who want to learn the development side of the J2EE technology. But for developers/engineers, it is a complete waste of time. Although the author does touch on every subject associated with J2EE he fails to connect all the dots. Explaining Java servlets and JSP, as one example, was a good start but there is nothing about how they work with each other. There arent very many examples either, but the ones that do exist, get right to the point and explain the subject matter appropriately. Too bad that isnt enough to make it more than a 2 star book. Glad I didnt pay full price for it (bought a used copy for $6 - barely makes it worth it)."
5,Excellent if you need to catch up J2EE and Web Services,This book is not for the complete Java novice. You need a good grounding in Java before undertaking J2EE to write Web Services applications. This is by far the best book I have seen on J2EE and Web Services. The book is well written; the examples are explained line by line. This book taught me everything I needed to about how to write a J2EE Web Services based application. It also shown me how to write a J2EE distributive application that is not web services based.
1,Shameful,"Borrowed this from a colleague more out of interest to see if it measures up at all, but I am afraid the 1 star reviews are on the spot. No need to explain why, the previous reviewers explain why. Shame on the author and publisher for the fake 5 star reviews."
1,One of the worst tech books I have seen,"I have purchased this book after reading the excelent Java 2: The Complete Reference, by Herbert Schildt.This book has lots of chapters covering many subjects but none of them goes deep enough to let you really learn what that thing means.There are chapters about HTML, XML and SQL that I really think that are not needed in that kind of book and the chapters about JSP and EJB are so small and poor in content that I had to go through the J2EE 1.4 tutorial provided by Sun to get the point on these techs.The most part of the book is waste on tables listing methods of classes, but it's just that: The author gives a table with a list of methods and a small sentence stating what it does. No code sample, no usage... If I was searching for list of classes and methods, the Sun documentation available online is more than good.I have not yet seen a really good J2EE book, even because I haven't read so many, but the Sun's tutorial looks very good."
1,"Should be ""0 star"" book.","This is a worst book I have been read. It is full of Java APIs listing like ""yellow pages"". None of topic touch the depth.I don't understand why the rating of this book is so high. (Maybe some friends of the author wrote them. :)"
5,An easy way to learn J2EE and Web Services programming,"I'm very impressed by the quality of this book. The book emphasizes the delicate balance, between engineering quality and brute performance, which a programmer must strive for. It gives lots of excellent advices along heavily commented code parts and detailed explanations."
1,Poor review,"I don't usually write reviews but this book seems to have collected some unwarrented high reviews.If you expect to learn J2EE, buy something else. The JSP and Servlet sections (which I already have experience) are incomplete enough to mislead you in the wrong direction. As for the EJB section (I have no experience), I know I will not be able to use this manual to learn.When I purchased this I was in a hurry. I now regret my haste. Do yourself a favour and by something else."
5,Does the Job!,Does the job well. The handle is large enough so that you dont hammer your fingers. It is also built well.
2,Could've been better,"I was terribly disappointed in this book. I had such high expectations for it! I like it when a series updates the readers on the past heroes and heriones. How are Jenise and 'Adeanne' getting on with the children? You know stuff like that. Plus I really did not like the heroine in this story. I will read the other books in this series, but only because I loved the previous ones - this one not so much!"
2,Only particial story,I was very disappointed that this book only has part of the story. It is a combo of two stories and neither one is a complete story. I am not happy with the author (who is one of my favorites) and the publisher for doing this.
2,Unfulfilled potential,"I love the Rejar series, but this story was dull. It had all the makings of a fantastic novel, but it never really took off. The love story between Soosha and Daxan was sketchy and contrived. It was a bit rambling. ""Kirkpatrick's Woods"" was also a rambling mess of a story. Borrow this book, don't buy it."
3,sad to say it's disappointing,"I found this on Dara Joy's web site and immediately ordered it. After eagerly awaiting it I was quite let down. None of the characters felt at all real and there was no spark to either romance. It just wasn't there. I was also disappointed that we didn't have any continuation of Rejar's story. God I hope Dara Joy get's back into it for her next book. I have all of her Rejar books, but I wouldn't have bought this if I had read it first."
2,"Waited so long, and ended up disappointed....","I fell in Love with the Dara Joy books from the get-go, and have missed her these past two years. This book was really easy to get into, but like another reader said, left you hanging. I thought it was kind of rushed, not like her others. Maybe I'm missing something, and this is just a teaser for her next book?"
2,Not a Comprehensive Book,"I was very disappointed in this book. I bought it soley for San Jose Del Cabo & Cabo San Lucas information, & a lot of restaurants & even resorts were missing. I found the sections on those two areas lacking in historial, cultural, sightseeing, restaurants, hotels and just about all ""areas"" of information. I would not recommend it if you want information on the two areas I mentioned above."
4,Great landscape ideas distilled down,"This is a book of pictures of lovely gardens. But not just lovely gardens in general; the authors have taken the very best bits from gardens all over the world and shown them to us and *explained* why they were showing them to us. How different gates fit into different garden styles. How the different elements of a Japanese garden work to create mood. How different garden styles fit different environments. Each picture has a terse bit of text telling us why this garden element is effective, so that the home gardener can make use of it.I like this approach. We may not be able to recreate Great Dixter or Hidcote, but we can certainly arrange plants in a way that creates a nice tableau or make it look nicer under the trees wth appropriate shade plants. It's a book that will have you marking pages so you can try out the ideas presented."
1,Hopefully a Limited Edition,"This bag is very Different in design. Thankfully there aren't many bags with the likes of this one.I was thinking of getting it for my mother who is very, very old. It is of a style which I think she could appreciate(she is very eccentric) I decided Not to Purchase this bag when I saw The Price on it !"
3,Cute but not as high quality as usual,"We own many Melissa & Doug toys including several puzzles. This one is very cute and my kids enjoy it. However, the quality is not as good as the other M&D puzzles we have purchased. The wood pieces are only painted on the top and have a rough unfinished feel on the sides and bottom, not very pleasant to touch."
5,These are sturdy puzzles,These puzzles are great for toddler fingers! They have knobs on the top for easy gripping and are nice and thick pieces. Arrived on time and in condition promised!
5,My son loves it!,"My son is such a fan of Melissa and Doug chunky puzzles. They have helped him name items from the puzzle and relate them to real life. I just don't know what one of the insects are. I know the butterfly is in the middle, but what is to the right of it? There is the spider and what is under that? Another butterfly? All and all, we will be buying more chunky puzzles. Recommend!"
3,Distracting background,"My 12 month old daughter was given this for Christmas. I've tried to help her match the bugs and do the puzzle, but she has no interest in puzzles so far (even four months later). I also find the green leaf and purple flower background of the puzzle to be very distracting and make it even more difficult to match the pieces where they should go. Now I just keep this near the changing table and let her hold one of the pieces when I change her diaper. The paint on the pieces seems to scratch kind of easily, but otherwise it at least seems fairly durable."
5,An unforgettable character in a fascinating business story.,"At the corporations where I have worked, the people who rise to the top are a lot like Harry Kramer, the protagonist of In Control. These people are attractive, shrewd, competitive, and narcissistic. At the same time, you feel a certain grudging admiration for such characters who do more good than harm while creating a world with themselves at the center. In Control captures this type of character perfectly while telling a gripping business drama that is resolved -- brilliantly and unexpectedly -- in the final chapter. Personally, I admire Harry Kramer. I also think there is a lot of pain and sadness in his life, which his ambitions force him to create or endure. He is a complicated and unforgettable man, but probably as familiar to most readers as the person in the corner office. I highly recommend this book."
1,"Weak, very weak","I bought this book based on the reviews on this site and was very disappointed. It is not a very good story, not at all realistic, with very weak characters.Move on."
5,In Control: Psychodrama of Corporate Power,"Ethan Cooper has done a wonderful job of portraying Harry Kramer, the smooth but despicable corporate megalomaniac who enjoys nothing better than manipulating the lives of those around him. And yet, successful as he is in business, he is certainly not in control of his family relationships. Business readers will see in Harry elements of horrible bosses they've no doubt had at some point in their own careers. This one's a page-turner!"
5,Corporate Life at the Summit,"This is a brilliant and disturbing book about the mind of a corporate big shot - a bank CEO, actually - who has tenuous but wily control of his company. I found the manipulative plotting of this CEO both maddening and fascinating, and, in my experience, an accurate portrayal of a type of personality that does well in corporate life. My favorite chapters are Four - where the CEO, Harry Kramer, describes the evolution of his successful corporate marriage - and Ten - where author Ethan Cooper captures perfectly the feel of a snobby suburban country club, where the social climbing is rampant. And yes, Cooper, you're right: Some country club cooking should never leave the kitchen!"
1,Worst book I ever tried to read!,What's the point? I can't imagine what Cooper was thinking when he decided to write this diatribe. It's possibly the worst book I've ever attempted to read. Supposedly the publisher is out of business. No wonder.
3,"Frost's poems commonly featured by an image of "" dark""","Most of his poems tells his appreciation an experience dealing with nature, for instance, if we observe one of his poem antitled 'stopping by woods on a snowy evening' which basically tends to reveal the nature relation especialy the relation of nature with man itself and in the significance nature will tell what are man's duty living in this world."
4,A useful addition to an Equine library.,"This is a well-researched and compiled book; useful for the REALLY serious horse enthusiast. Filled with masses of interesting information, but possibly a little 'overloaded' with details about 'broken-coloured' horses. Contains a superb 'references' section and a well-compiled index. It is a pity that ALL the illustrations are in black and white, but this may partly account for the good value for money of this book."
4,Yes Yes Yes!,"Yes! This book tells it all. Mind you, it is not simple to read. If you do not have a genetic/biologic background, it may at times be impossible to understand. Not many illustrations, and black and white only. But for the person who does have at least somewhat understanding of genetics it is a MUST HAVE!Unfortunally here and there a little out-dated (homozygous testing for Tobiano and OLWS testing at the time not yet available)."
2,Looks good but not a very good bird feeder,"I gotta admit, I was drawn into the concept that it serves 2 purposes although the first being that of an attractive lawn ornament works just fine. The other as a bird feeder is not that good. If the entire front face would open that would be one thing, but the tiny slot on top (which won't stay on too well) is where the food goes.It is of very strong durable construction which is great. No problem with that."
2,Looks Great! Works. But wasteful & difficult to fill!,I really like the looks of this sun flower bird feeder. It does work but is not practical.Pros:- well constructed and metal is sturdy when pressed into the ground- no assembly requiredCons:- bird seed spills everywhere when trying to fill it. I have to wrap a towel around it to keep all the seed from spilling out throw the mesh container as I am filling it.- have to refill it too frequently be/c squirrels knock it to get it to spill all the seeds.
5,David McCulloughs' John Adams,"Great book by a great author. It's all that I expected and more. Loaded it on my Kindel, I'm reading it now."
3,Luke warm,"I ordered this and the Defected in the house evissa '04 and they both started off HOT, then went luke warm FAST.Out of 3 discs there were only 5 songs total that I liked.I was really let down."
5,great thread,Great thread to match commercial jeans. As a seamstress I have all types of jeans to hem and fix. Thread is spun with great quality.
1,Not believable,dont waste your time and money. Juvenile. Had to stop half way. Personalities were cardboard cut outs and emotions described were not believable.
1,SNIPER SHOT - Unprofessional,As a former Law Enforcement Officer I found the characters in this book poor examples of my profession. The author tries to mix the heavy responsilities of Policing with heavy extra marital activities. If you enjoy reading Carter Brown style publications then this might appeal to you.
5,excellent,I won't buy anything else! Puppies were really sick from using other milk replacers. I highly recommend this product to all.
4,Informative and Helpful,"As a pilot of the 70's, I hadn't had to learn the GPS flying system. I have recently had the opportunity to fly GPS equipped aircraft and needed some basic instruction. This book along with a very good friend (who is a CFII) got me familiar with the working of the unit.I would have given the book a five star rating, but I feel you can only LOVE God, Your country and your family. I ""liked"" the book."
4,Convenience is everything,"I've looked for Drinkables vitamins at stores with no luck. I originally bought this product at BJ's but since then they only carry the Drinkables joint formula. I've taken multi-vitamins on and off over the past decade, and this product makes it easy to get your daily dose at any time, even on an empty stomach. With pill vitamins, I always have to wait to take with meals, then forget, so I don't always take them, and is the main reason I like this product. I just wish they made a stronger multi vitamin version - I am one of those who like to take stong multis - with like 1333% of all the water soluables, and plenty of everything else, but this product fills the immedate need!"
1,Beware of trace mineral blend: Mercury & Lead ????,"I purchased this based on the nutrients listed in the description & because I liked their other product. But I will be returning it unopened because the trace mineral blend (252 mg) that includes (among other things): lead, mercury, fluoride, bromide, cadmium, aluminum, arsenic, gold, silver, antimony, beryllium, bismuth, platinum, tungsten, uranium, thallium ... heavy metals ...Why would these items be put into a food item on purpose?"
5,Fascinating and Important,"Inspiring, lively, relevant and offering a Judaism that is meaningful, this book taught me so much that is important and heart-opening about Judaism. Why didn't they explain it this way in religious school? In the introduction Rabbi Milgram asks: ""Do you wish for a life that is physically grounded, emotionally satisfying, intellectually expansive, and profoundly connected?"" Yes, actually, I do. And she does go on to offer profound ways to do this as a Jew. Her approach is one of deeply respectful pluralism - the teachings are relevant to every denomination and will also resonate with agnostics, atheists and non-Jewish partners. This Judaism is about our real, everyday lives and each page raised my awareness about how Judaism is filled with practices that can enhance the quality of our lives and relationships."
4,"cheesy, campy, classic...just the thing","I saw this way back when it first came out, and like most folks I was just happy no one had to die at the end of it. Is it a great movie? No, but it is a slice of life and time that does play more like a Lifetime movie, but both guys look good and all involved seem to get a happy ending of their own, which is nice. I will always be a Michael Ontkean fan, he is just hot."
3,My how times have changed,"I will never forget when I saw this movie at the Montreal Film Festival. Nobody was there and a couple of American tourists in their 40's sat in front of my (then) ""domestic partner"" and me. When the kiss came, I thought Mr. was going to get sick. He let out a grunt heard round the theater! And we had never seen that before and thought, ""Yes, it's about time""!Seeing this movie again shows just how far things really haven't changed in America except the hair styles and clothes. It's been over 20 years and the issues today are still the same as back then, perhaps just fewer men are unaware of their sexuality at such a late age.I always thought Michael Ontkean would have a great career after this movie, he played his part so well. Alas, it was not to be. Kate Jackson was so perfect and Harry Hamlin made you realize gay men were shallow to protect themselves from the potential ravages of depth.I think this is a classic gay-themed movie and am glad it is back on the market."
5,This is an amazing movie of human relationships.,"This remarkable film of human relationships and the struggle with identity and love should receive many awards for exellence. In a most sensitive way, it shows the different types of gay lifestyle; the promiscuous , and the person searching for a committed relationship. The acting of all persons in this film was super . This film was way ahead of its time and on the cutting edge of film making for being made in the '80's."
4,Movie Review,I think this is a very good movie about relationships and realizing your true self. Kate Jackson is perfect as the concerned/confused wife and Micheal Ontkean and Harry Hamlin are very good in their roles as well. The movie is very tastefully done and truly about the characters and their evolutions not just sex.
4,"Well done. A moving, well-acted film","I remember seeing this when it first came out. Actually, I was first coming out areound the same time and I was terrified. Anyway, I remember seeing the ads on TV and I went to see it one afternoon -- and I skipped school to do it. Maybe it is because the film came out at an important time in my life, but I do have a special place in my heart for it. Kate Jackson is wonderful in this. I have never seen her in the same way since. Both Ontkean and Hamlin are great in their roles (and kudos to them for doing this risky film.) Today, it is dated in some ways - but the story itself is still very relevant. Highly recommended."
1,Making Love Scene Completely Cut,"I saw this movie in the theater some almost 30 years ago with my then partner and I definately remember the Love Making scene being hot and heavy though heavily shadowed in darkness. But the scene is completely gone in the DVD, as well as the kiss. Now why in the world would they cut that out!!!??? That was the whole point of going to see the movie at that time, it was on the cutting edge. One star because you screwed with the whole point of the movie ""Making Love""."
4,"Customer REVIEW for ""Making Love""","Since this movie was made so long ago, I was able to overlook the incessant homosexual stereotypes that seem to be a staple of this movie's many sub-plots. All in all, the movie was excellent compared to the overabundant, trashy gay-themed movies being cranked out over the last 5 years. The story was very common to most of us in the male gay community, the outgoing and out-of-the-closet typical token gay meets the straight, married and confused bi-curious(?) man... a strained and exciting affair begins and ends, etc. etc. ... Kate Jackson's performance was mediocre at best, completely eclipsed by the mere site of Michael Ontkean and Harry Hamlins gorgeous bodies and manliness devouring eachother in the several erotic scenes that appear to be only moderately edited. A GREAT MOVIE OVERALL, i recommend if the price is right, BUIY IT!!"
4,"She's ticklish, but he is gay","MAKING LOVE was maybe the only film I can remember that did not play homosexuality for laughs or portray gay men as psycho-killers. Whether or not you agree homosexuality is a sin, you can't deny that the movies' gay stereotyping doesn't help anyone. Anyway, MAKING LOVE features Kate Jackson, who proves she can act better than they let her in that stupid ""Charlie's Angels"" TV show. At one point Kate's husband tickles her as she begs him to stop. Next thing she knows, he's confessing to her that he is gay."
2,What???,"I really don't understand how people can compare this third- rate movie with a masterpiece like ""Brokeback Mountain"". Dull plot, less than average acting (Michael Ontkean is particularly awful in his role, and he is the main character in the movie, so...), and situations full of cliches. I would recommend it only for historical reasons as the first mainstream Hollywood movie to openly address the topic of gay relationships."
4,Making Love,"Saw this movie back in 1982-when was first released in theaters,then bought when it,was released the video market in Beta and VHS formats,now updating my video collection in DVD.Liked it then(memories when first came out-publicly)and Still would enjoy viewing it today and fortunate to have it among my collection."
2,Lacks depth but ok for learning to program EAs,"This book is poorly structured and lacks depth. It trivialises aspects of EAs, especially representational issues. I understand the emphasis is on teaching the reader how to program GAs using mathematica but I would not recommend this book as an introduction to GAs. The visualisation aspects of Mathematica applied to EAs are useful, but I would definitely recommend Melanie Mitchell's Introduction to Genetic Algorithms or one of Koza's books for those interested in GP."
5,Wow,"His story is so inspirational, and I am so glad to be a part of the industry he revolutionized. I think hairstylist or not, that this documentary can inspire the masses. He worked so hard, and I think his story is one of greatness."
2,Not at all like the picture,"So these took a long time for me to commit to. They look great online.However, i just received the 3 sets of these for upcoming wedding: my dad, my soon to be father in law and myself.everyone of these sets had some sort of blemish/tarnish on them.The quality seems to be horrible.I am telling them to take them back for either a full refund.I don't think i can risk them sending another three sets because I don't think that they will be any better. If only 1 set was defective then ok, but all 3??- Scott"
4,trash truck'n,"We bought this truck for our 2 year old as he is fascinated with ""trash trucks"", and he loves it! Even months later he still loves playing with it. My only possible complaint would be that it's somewhat hard to carry places as the back of the truck has different opening points which makes the truck flop open while trying to pick up or carry, especially for a little one. This is not a big enough problem, however, for me to not recommend it. It is sturdy and there are other pieces in the Little Tikes line of vehicles that coordinate well with it."
4,Little Tikes Garbage Truck -- Durable and Fun,"Bought this for my 2.5 year old. He LOVES garbage trucks. The toy has withstood lots of his dumping and crashing and crushing. My only complaint is that the truck and dump part come detached pretty easily -- just picking up the truck off the floor and they come apart. Easy to pop back together, but it's a little annoying. Otherwise.. great toy."
5,Great truck,"Our G-son loves this truck. Good for smaller kids, because it is a larger truck. The whole back opens so it is easy to get the treasures out of."
2,Caring for Your Baby and Young Child : Birth to Age 5,the book was listed a hard copy but i got a paperback. so for that reason i was not happy.
5,"Great, Practical Gift Making Ideas For Kids - Highly Recommended!","""Gifts In A Jar: For Kids"" is a very cute spiral bound book that contains some great recipes for ""kits"" that are portioned to fit in 1-quart canning jars. We found this on sale at a book liquidator for a lot less than it is being sold here at Amazon. That being said, now that we have seen the book we would have paid the full price.The spiral binding is very useful since it allows the book to stay open when laid out on your counter top. This is handy as you measure out the ingredients to be placed in your canning jar or, as my daughter (16) did for 12 of her classmates, plastic gift bags.The included instruction/gift tags are a nice touch, but we did not want to pull pages out of the book. We just scanned the pages into the computer and printed out the needed copies. You could also make your own labels.Not just for kids, this is a great resource for anyone needing quick and relatively inexpensive homemade gifts.Highly recommended!"
5,O-27 Track Pack #1,Order arrived on time. Nice product for Old Lionel Train Ready Sets. I used to expand O train Oval track to form an 8 track. It works fine.
3,the purchase is worth it,"This cd is alright. the track listings on the back are wrong, check the booklets to straighten that out. Pitch black and ambush are not on this cd, it even drops their names in the intro, but they weren't on here. i think i heard part of one of their verses on freestyle 2, but that track is cut short. all around, this album's pretty sick, but is probably the worst release from zion i if u relate it to deep water, mind over matter, break a dawn, or even the take over. grab their other stuff before you hit this 1 up."
3,Cloud Strife Action Figure,"The action figure is a hit with my daughter, unfortunately, this is her 3rd one. They keep breaking. Hopefully, they will consider making them a bit more sturdy."
4,A good display piece,"The detail for this figure is very good with a nicely detailed face and suit. The only problems I encountered involved the arms: the right arm is a little weak so that you need to be extra careful when attaching the hands or you might snap the joint. The same right arm was also made too loose, so that posing with the sword can only be done using both hands. Limited movement with the left arm also means that the sword is either posed directly in front of Cloud, or is hanging limply at the side. Overall, however, I am pleased with the purchase and quality of the figure."
2,Greatly detailed but a huge disapointment,"Pro: Highly detailed in every body parts of the action figure. The sword was Epic. Very well made with a lot of details.Cons: Unfortunately when I opened the box and took Cloud out his leg fell off right away. All my excitement just went downhill after I saw his leg fell off like it was already broken before someone put him into the box. Perhaps my action figure was just a defect out of the hundreds out there, but with his right leg broken I can only super glue his leg back and can't pose him in any cool pose or any sort of pose. Also one of his arms couldn't fit into the socket very well which affected Cloud's ability to hold the sword properly.Overall: Amazing action figure but poorly designed. If his leg wouldn't have came off right at the moment I took the action figure out then I would of given this review a 5 stars. However His right leg broke off the moment I took him out of the box therefore I give this action figure a 2/5 stars."
5,the old neighboorhood,"what a great movie, its funny they release all the crappy old movies first. Then they forget a classic like this until now. No wonder hollywood is in bad shape."
5,The Seven Up's is AMAZING,"O.K.,so the ""Seven Up's"" is ""OLD SCHOOL"".And, it's friggin awesome.I would highly suggest this for movie night.Enjoyed it completely.Great action, suspense and it has not onecomputer generated special effect.It relies on ACTING. which is..excellent."
5,"They don't make these movies, anymore.","The seventies proved to be the decade of real life ,real people and real places filmaking especially for NYC Police drama's.The SEVEN-UP's in my oppinion is the best made and true to life police story put on film.The characters are all based on real people and the story dwells on true incidents in the murky world of undercover investigations. A must for all police buffs/fans."
3,More on action then there is any plot. Great chase scene.,"The plot is nothing to talk about, but Bill Hickman does it again with a great car chase just like the one he did in ""Bullitt"".He drove the ""Charger"" in that film."
3,nice!,"I saw this movie when I was 15 in 1980's. This chase scene was incredible.Now I saw it again, my feeling was stronger than 25 years ago."
3,Violent but what a car chase. WOW !,"I am not really into cop flix, but a friend of mine told me to rent this vid. I did and I liked it. The car chase is the best I've ever seen, I played that back 4 different times !!!!!! The story line is basic and predictable and the movie is violent for youngsters, but it still gets 3 stars from me. 1 star for storyline and 2 big stars for long, long car chase scene. Grab some popcorn and sit back and enjoy !"
1,buyer beware,"Sleepy LaBeef is a great performer and has cut some fine tracks but he has also recorded a lot of dreck. This isn't necessarily his fault but it does mean that this multi-CD box set has a lot of worthless stuff on it. If you can find it the Eagle label single CD ""Let's Turn Back the Years"" includes most of his best rockabilly tunes and a number of live tracks and is a much better collection."
4,Special archive Tale of great beginings...,"This is a bit of a rare documentary, and can be found on DVD also with some versions of the 'Please come home Mr. Bulbous' album. If you are interested in this really influential special fantastic cool legend heavy funk pop rock band you really have to see this. It features the band members talking candidly about how they initially got together, the early days, getting their first record deal, early touring and writing. Really interesting and cool little gem of a doc about a hugely underrated classic heavy rock band."
4,an early career retrospective,"This video is a simple documentation, put together by Ty Tabor about the era from when King's X formed to when they were signed. It shows home video and public access footage of some early shows. It is a good addition to a true fan's collection, but probably would not be appreciated by a non-fan."
3,not what i expected,"let me just say this before i begin my review..do not believe anyone on this website that states that ""cult of luna"" sound like ""isis"" because they dont.that is the reason that i purchased this cd now i havent listened to any of thier other albums but as far as this cd goes needless to say i was extreamly dissapointed when i was expecting to hear a band somewhat similar to isis but what i heard was nothing close infact to be honest what i heard were vocals that sounded like some mediocherhardcore band like ""throwdown"" and music that was produced in a manner that would make darkthrone cringe.so do not buy this cd if you are thinking it will sound like isis.."
3,"Beautifull, Informative, and well done","This is one of the better books that I have seen on the topic of curtain wall design. It is full of very accurate amd well explained techincal information as well labeled details. The project section is a comprehensive study of some of the most complex curtain walls built. This section is full of detail drawings and color images of the built details. This is a MUST HAVE book for anyone working on complex wall systems, or anyone interested in the state of the art in curtain wall design."
2,Difficult to understand,"I found this book quite difficult to understand. It has too much jargon, and the instructions to the games are sometimes unclear. There is no glossary. It seems to be aimed at an audience that is already familiar with most of the games."
5,It's a classic.,"This book is the old version with all the old rules, and, since I am an old guy, I like things old. The book was just as expected."
4,Ready for the Second MacLean Story,This Highland tale follows the romance of Rory and Joanna. They are both against a marriage required by the King and the adventure begins when Rory comes to claim his bride and her lands. There is intrigue and suspense. There are predictable moments and plot turns but Rory is fun to read about and Joanna is a sweet innocent who shows unusual wisdom in the end. The tale is easy to read. I finished the book in 2 days and enjoyed the reading.
4,Worth reading.....,"It took me quite awhile to warm up to ""The MacLean Groom"" ....Infact, I felt that the beginning dragged horribly and I almost set it aside...I am however, very glad that I gave it a chance...Inevitably the story grew on me...the strongest point of the book would definitely be the character Rory..I adored him...He was so loving and patient.....I felt that he was way too good for Joanna...It bothered me that she was so inconsistent with him throughout the beginning of the story, but eventually she pulls it together and I ended up liking her regardless....I would like to see Lachlan and Raine paired up..I don't know if they will...but I'm hoping! Anyways..this book is worth reading..if you find yourself struggling through its start, give it a chance..I think youll be glad that you did."
4,The MacLean Groom - Highland Lairds Trilogy,"This is supposed to be a ""trilogy"". Where are the other two books?"
1,Good concept needing professional help,"This could have been a great movie, but poor production values held it back. The acting was stilted. Scenes didn't link together well, and some made no sense as to why they were included. Then suddenly there's miracles galore (sarcasm), but they had to wrap up the film in 10 minutes. A women has a 60 second labor, not likely for a first-time mother. The new father vows to quit his high-paying soap opera gig in order to focus on his wife and kid. That's nice, but you jettisoned your income source just when family expenses are going to increase. That's irresponsible and immature. This is the director's idea of a good father? Everybody resolves to do better in the last 5 minutes, despite months' and even years' worth of issues building up. Unrealistic. If you want to see a truly excellent production on this subject matter, watch Fireproof."
4,An interesting movie about working thru life's problems,"I would actually like to give this 3 1/2 stars, but I'll be generous. It told the tale of three married couples and their problems mixing marriage and life's problems. I wish it would have emphasized more how these couples took their relationship problems to the cross. However, I have witnessed couples face problems not a lot different than the ones shown here. This movie emphasizes how important it is to be committed to each other and how to work toward solving problems, rather than to look at divorce as the answer. Anyone going thru a divorce knows how devastating it is for both partners for years to come."
3,Marriage is Great,"I really mean that, marriage is great, when we do it right. As a Christian knowing God's plan for marriage is easy but sometimes accomplishing that plan and living up to those vows can be difficult. In today's society so many want to just quit at the first sign of trouble. 99.9999% of the time is it is purely based on selfishness. This movie touches on that issue and it does have a Christian basis. While in my life that is vital to some it might not be so. This movie is kind of like a Hallmark Channel Christmas story, Predictable but with a satisfying ending. It has humor, it shows how selfish we can be as humans, but at the end it does show the importance of marriage and understanding for it to succeed we MUST sacrifice what we want and live unselfishly. Nice date night movie."
3,"Works good, but not for long","This speed sensor is very easy to setup, and worked very good right out of the box. The downside is this is the third unit I have purchased in the last nine months. The battery just doesn't last very long, and it is not user replaceable. Polar will replace the battery for a fee."
2,mixed results,"This is a replacement. Hit a bump (not bad enough to damage my wheel) but makes the speed sensor erratic. Product should be more robust. Also, cannot mount the receiver on the handlebars - has to be worn on my left wrist as otherwise reception from the speed sensor is very poor."
1,Battery Profit Maker for Polar,It's like the printer cartridge replacement program where companies make more $$$ on replacement cartridges than the product i.e. Polar CS100 bicycle computer speedometer. I refuse to pay $40.00 every year or so and into the garbage can it goes... It's close to robbery.
3,This should be a lot better from a maker like Polar,"I've used this bike computer for several years and every one has had the same problem - it shuts off for no apparent reason and then starts back up. Some sensors seem to be better but virtually every one I've had does it to some extent, including this new one I bought to put on a new bike. It also doesn't make sense that the battery cannot be changed easily. I probably wouldn't recommend this but I'm married to it now with at least three sets on six bikes."
1,great when the battery works,I loved this product until the battery failed. It is insane that you cannot replace the battery yourself.
3,"no no, what?","It was a really good read, very engaging, but by the end of the book, I swore if I read the monk said ""ho, ho, what?"" one more time I was gonna personally rip his innards out and hand them to the demon! Arrrgh! It was like every other page of the last half of the book. Also the book seemed a little extra long. I'd come to a spot that sounded like the end and think okay.....only there were 4 chapters afterwards. This happened about 3 times! LOL. But I did like the characters and the storyline, and found it interesting how the monk changed into a completely different character. And I'm in love with Elbryan!"
2,Good Beginning,"I liked the beginning of the book, but then i just got bored once all the characters found eachother. Who knows if i'll ever finish it. At least it was free."
5,"An excellent, spellbinder","Just when you think it's moving slow the plot explodes into action and doesn't ever stop. A unique story to be sure, with familiar elements from Salvatore's more popular (arguably?) Drizzit series. (if you think i spelled it wrong than you need to read a little closer next time.)I picked it up to have something to read while waiting for the next hunter's blades book. I'm nearly finished with the trilogy now, 3 weeks later."
1,Boring,I didnt like this Book. I found it boring like a cooking book. Even when the demon dactyl kills someone by slitting open his belly it reads like a description how to break open an egg.I didnt read it to the end.
5,One of the best books I've read in years.....,"This was the first Salvatore I read, and now, only a few months later, I'm having trouble finding Salvatore books I haven't read."
5,This was really awesome,I loved RAS's books and I still do. This one totally exceeded my expections and I really loved it! It was soooo imaginative and cool and- some what emotional. It was RAS's best work yet!
4,Demon Awakens: Action packed and never a dull moment,"RA Salvatore has done it again! The Demon Awakens is a beautifully written book with a well realized magical system and a vibrant world as a backdrop. The true force, however, is the characters. Every reader can easily identify and empathize with these well drawn characters. The battle between good and evil is sometimes grey, but three unlikely heros form a bond that will touch the reader from cover to cover! This is perhaps Mr. Salvatore's finest work since the ""Dark Elf trilogy"", the inside cover touts and everyone who is a fan of fantasy should take these words to heart. This world is a fantasy readers dream come true, with all the elements that draws the classical fantasy reader. This book and the books following is a must read for all fantasy fans and even readers not familiar with the fantasy realm. Kudo's to Mr. Salvatore!"
3,Okay,"I think that salvatore says to many times about the woman in his books about there free spirit. The characters are quite a bit like his forgotten realms books. Pony reminds me off Cattie-brie and Wulfgar with her inner struggles with memorys. If you like salvatore you will enjoy it, it is nothing compared to Dark elf trilogy or his other forgotten realms books. But hey if you have finished try this one."
2,This book is too slooooow!,"Ok, so I bought this book with great expectations . But do I get? The first chapters are good and promising, but... Mr. Salvatore, you are a good writer, but this...Yuck! Too tedious, too long-winded (we all know what is gooing to happen in the end!) - and TOO BOORING!!!!!"
3,Not the best Salvatore,"I have read many fantasy/fiction books and this is not the best of them. I was let down by the author, but I guess after reading the Dark Elf Trilogy and the other series about Drizzt, That anything other than Drizzt is a let down. While R.A. Salvatore continues to be my favorite author, he has not maintained the level of excellence I have come to expect from him. I am glad that Drizzt is returning :-)"
3,"A quick read, but makes you work for it.","I enjoyed this book, but the author's style is an acquired taste. Many fantasy readers will love it, but for some of us the writing seems to get in the way of the story. I felt at times as if the author was trying too hard. That said, I would not turn you away from the book, rather encourage you to read the first few pages and see if it hooks you."
2,Cliche Fantasy,"Same old story about an ancient evil returning and a hero, who, after undergoing tragedy gets trained for the sole purpose of fighting said evil to eventually grow up, reunite with his long lost love, team up with a band of adventurers to pursue ancient evil in its lair. Salvatore tries to make up for this by filling this story with human interest, but the characters' personalities fall flat, and soon become as tired as their catch phrases. Throughout all of this he gets incredibly preachy, spouting pages filled with tired mantras of ""do no evil, trust in your friends, treat all animals with respect, and don't litter"" via a plot device allowing the main character to talk to himself. There's much better Fantasy out there, skip this one."
4,"A very good book, spiced with sex and sword-fighting","As many people already said, this is a Drizzt-like book. On the other hand, if you are used to AD&D characters, you'll get a shock: the elves fly, the dwarves are evil, there is almost no wizard magic and priest magic is done using precious stones. I think this book has a little too much sex for a kid, so I recomend it for older people. Again, this is a depart from the good old stories, where nobody even think of sex or bath. All in all, it's a different book worth reading."
4,R.A. Salvatore creates an entirely new world!,"First off, if you lack any imagination and depth, you will dislike this book. All of the not-so-good reviews have been from people who have a hard time reading children's novels.Salvatore creates an entirely new world from his imagination and the characters are created with skillful writing. As usual the battles and fights are so descriptive, you swear they happened right in front of you! The subplots beneath the main really kept things interesting.A definite choice for any die hard fan of REAL fantasy adventure writing!"
1,"Skip this one, please.","I bought this book as an autographed copy. What a find! I had thought. After reading it, I returned it back to the store I'd bought it from. It took all my self-control not to throw the book against the wall before returning it.I cannot begin to list the problems with this book. An incoherent, meandering plot with lackluster characters and a villain that's almost too silly to believe, is a start. Do I really need to know how sailors satisfy their carnal urges while on long trips? Does anyone really understand why the heroine--and I use the term lightly--has three different names in the story? And why did the elves treat Elbryan like a slave and not a friend, if he's supposed to be some sort of savior?I heartily urge those who haven't read it; please don't. I'm glad some of those who posted their reviews liked it, but there are better books to read than this one."
5,Salvatore's best work! Need I say more?,"Salvatore has done it again! The Demon Awakens is most definately the best work he has ever done. Once I started this book, I couldn't and wouldn't put it down untill I finished it. This book is now my most favorite book! I really had feelings for Elbryan, Pony and Avelyn. This book has great depth and great characters.Lets see more his work just like this"
4,"Good, all around book","R.A. Salvatore has written The Demon Awakens, a book that he claims is the novel that he has always wanted to write. It seems that the editors at Del Rey are easier to work with, partially because they are not breathing down his back to quickly write a top selling work. He has created what many hope will be his best book ever. Thus, R.A. Salvatore, who is known to many as the creator of TSR's Drittz has a lot riding on this novel. Its success or failure could determine whether or not he is seen as a serious fantasy writer or just part of the previous TSR book factory. For the rest of the review go to http://www.fantasylink.co"
3,Eh...,"You'll be all right if you're an upper-level student of the language and you're trying to tackle the text. Still, keep a dictionary close because there isn't a glossary to be had (which is too bad because this thing could friggin' use one). Definitely not a light read, but the chapters are concise and it's not entirely uninformative once you finally understand what it says."
5,Voices of Truth and Love,"Unlike the frightening inner voices of her mother, Virginia Holman's literary voices speak with reality, honesty, and love.Ms.Holman has captured the conflicted emotions of a daughter struggling with anger and embarrassment, even as she seeks to comprehend the mother's mental illness and offer a child's loyalty and concern. This book is a tribute to the resiliency of children,and to the human quest for answers to our most urgent queries.It's ironic that Ms. Holman's mother,in her deranged need to nurture and shelter fantasy children, was unable to provide the emotional support her real daughters craved. You will not soon forget the themes of this book, or the people whose experiences are recounted."
4,PLAN TO STAY UP LATE (reading),"this was one that I couldnt put down. A page turning memoir.Plan to stay up late reading, if you buy this one. I read a great deal so it takes a lot to capture and keep my atention. This one did that.........."
5,Thank You Virginia Holman,"I would like to thank Virginia Holman for writing this book.Being the offspring of a mother diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, I was also brought up with maternal delusional thought processses and paternal helplessness. I know what a difficult story this is to narrate. Virginia Holman could not have done a better job."
1,As hard to understand as the math itself,"As my title states this program is ""as hard to understand as the math itself"". Too much reading is involved. If I wanted to read and not understand I would read the book again. Needs more graphics and animations. Not a very good math supplement."
2,Where's the Beef?,Too much fluff and not enough meat for my needs. Too much reading and not enough interactive sitations dealing with the concepts. Not enough examples and step by step directions to solving problems would have helped. It seems like they put all of their resources into the introduction clip and blew off the math! Not impressed! You'd be better off just DOING YOUR HOMEWORK! Not good for supplimental instruction.
1,Mini Wedge Shape Blind Spot Mirrors,We returned them because they were of very poor quality. We are waiting for a credit to appear on our credit card statement.
4,concise concordance,"Although somewhat smaller than I realized when I ordered, it is fine for most study situations. The size fits easily into a briefcase for travel."
5,Very Fun and Entertaining,My daughter is 12 months and LOVES this book! We read it every night and is always her first pick. I recommend this book highly!
5,Dinosaurs win at bedtime,This is a clever story with beautiful pre-schooler friendly illustrations. My four year old neice loves the book (and the companion stuffed tyrannosaurus). She is so enthralled with the story that she asked (no kidding) to take a nap on Saturday as we had told her the book was only for bedtime!
5,A Bedtime favorite!,"My 2 1/2 year old son absolutely loves this book! It is a bedtime staple in our house everynight, definately his favorite. We bought the book hoping to show him the proper way to say goodnight, i.e. no tantrums or fussing. He now reads along with daddy and almost knows the book by heart. I highly recommend this book for all children."
5,for parents of little dinosaurs as well as sleepy children,"You probably know all the tricks these little dinosaurs get up to in order to avoid going to sleep if your kids are anything like mine. Children of 3+ shriek with delight at seeing both gentle and dangerous dinosaurs ROAR, bounce about, demand one more story etc. when mother and father try to put them to bed. But of course, this isn't how little dinosaurs behave at all... The rhyming couplets are irresistibly funny, and the pictures stupendous. Any child afraid of monsters will be reassured by seeing them depicted in this way. Alongside Jeanne Willis's classic, The Monster Bed, and Debi Gliori's A Lion at Bed-time, this is a perfect way to get a child to sleep. Just bew warned though - they'll want to play at being dinosaurs first."
5,My Little Dinosaur loves this book!!,"Our 3 year old boy loves this book! It is has become a permanent fixture to our bedtime ritual. He ""reads"" the book back to me. I just purchased the T-Rex doll that goes along with this book and bought the book How Do Dinosaurs get Well? I am sure he will love them also. He was never interested in dinosaurs til we read this book, he can identify several dinosaurs now."
4,Does a Dinosaur Roar?,"Great book for my 3 1/2 year old son. He loves the colorful pictures and the story is simple enough that he has most of it memorized. In particular, he enjoys pointing out the little details such as one of the dinosaurs is holding a train in his hands, another one has a teddy bear. I think it's easy for my son to relate to the story since the dinosaurs depicted in the book have similar toys as he does. Highly recommended for preschoolers and anyone else who doesn't like saying good-night right away before going to sleep."
5,There are dinosaurs at our house at bedtime!,"This book is so neat. Not only do kids get to see how ridiculous some of their night time tricks are, but they also get to learn the dinosaur names and laugh at the pictures. Nice illustrations."
4,Great Bedtime Story,"What a great book! My son was pitching fits before bedtime, I read him this and it really helped! I love how the book dramatizes normal kid behavior and helps kids realize how silly they are!"
3,"nice book, Teague and Yolen are terrific team","This and Tyrannosaurus Dad are my two favorite dinosaur books. Oh and of course Syd Hoff. Oh and also, We're Back! All are books that are above and beyond the typical. Nice pairing here of author and artist."
4,"Good night. Good night, little dinosaur","This book quickly runs through various methods children - I mean, dinosaurs - use to try to prolong bedtime, before finally showing the method that children should - and dinosaurs DO - use to go to sleep on time.The charm is all in the illustrations - don't worry too much about the text."
5,A Fun Bedtime Story for Dinosaur Lovers of All Ages,"How does a dinosaur say goodnight? Jane Yolen's, How Do Dinosaurs Say Goodnight?, offers a few humorous ways a dinosaur might say goodnight that are not unlike the typical antics of a toddler resisting bedtime. Children will enjoy looking at the illustrations of various dinosaurs acting like impish toddlers. As an added bonus, all of the illustrations have the name of each page's featured dinosaur written somewhere in the picture. Parents and children will have the opportunity to learn the names of these prehistoric beasts.My children love this story. They ask for it nearly every night. I like it because the end reinforces the way children should go to sleep, which makes my job of tucking my children in, just a bit easier."
5,Bedtime Read,Great book for reading at bedtime with my three year old son.The colorful illustrations and cute story is a perfect read before we turn out the lights.
5,Wonderful books on teaching manners,My daughters loved these books. I purchased two of these for 2 and 3 year old boys. The art and story is wonderful plus it gives parents examples to share with their children on how not to behave. Highly recommend these delightful books.
5,Wonderful Service!,Thank you for your prompt shipping for my nephew's Christmas present. The books were in great condition and everyone was very pleased. We will definitely tell our friends to order from you all.
4,Types of dinos,"What I really enjoyed about this book wasn't so much the story (which is fun, though nothing indepth) but the fact that each illustration has a dinosaur labeled with its saurian name! I think this is a great way to introduce children to the various types of dinos and familiarize them with their fantastic names."
5,Fantastic bedtime book!,"Beautifully illustrated, great simple questions and answers, fascinates even young children but I can see it going the distance b/c there are aspects to attract kids of all ages. Really outstanding book!"
5,Excellent book for 2 year olds,My nephew loves this book. I bought it based on an earlier review that was posted and it completely holds true. The book has been read to him so many times he knows all the words. I bought another one for my other nephew. I highly recommend!
5,Kid's Dinosaur Dream,"This is a great book because it has a great story and also has the names of several of the different types of dinosaurs. It is a good bedtime story as it gives a lesson about the appropriate way to go to bed (without puttting up a fight). We owned this book before and I accidentally returned it to the library with our library books. So, I am sure that the Whetstone library in Columbus, OH is enjoying my little accidental donation."
4,Great but only for boy dinosaurs?,"This book is great to read to little ones at bedtime, but I was disappointed that there are no girl dinosaurs apparently: the book only has ""He"" and ""His""."
1,Disappointed,"The quality of the CD was terrible. I could not get the CD to play in most CD players. There must have been a problem with the formatting. CD players had difficulty finding the beginning of a track. Once it did find the track I was disappointed that it was so short. There were other languages on the CD but overall it was too short, would not play in most players and was not worth the money."
5,The Best Children's Book Yet!,My grandson absolutely love this book and we've read it everynight for the last two weeks. The illustrations are outstanding!
4,Very cute story.,"I owed the book before and thought it was such a fun story for boys. When I opened the box, I noticed it was a hard cover. I am not sure if I saw that in the product description. Still, a great buy!"
4,kids love finding the dinosaur names,They like to find the names on each page in different places. The dinos are very funny expressions just like kids not wanting to sleep.
5,"Excellent resource and teaching guide,","In an effort to study and pass the MOUS exam for Word 2000, I chose to teach Word 2000 at my company. Having a complete list of the MOUS objectives, Chapter references and examples for each objective, and practice documents was invaluable. But, to also have practice test questions was the topping on the cake. After I finished teaching the course, the students and I reviewed the MOUS objectives and walked through the practice exam, this really refined and focus what was learned from the book and CD."
5,Learned a Lot from this Book!,"I use Microsoft Word 2000 for nearly everything that needs to be typed, so I was really glad when I got this book. I learned a ton of things, like how to insert a boarder around pages, how to create special affects with WordArt,(WordArt allows you to create cool bubble letters, slanted text, and stuff like that.) how to double space a paragraph, even how to change the Office Assistant, and so much more! This is a fantastic resource, with even some humor thrown in. Very complete, very good."
2,Not complete for anyone who already knows how to use Word,"This book has so far been a failure in my life. I totally regret having purchased it. I have consulted it only 3 times and each time there was nothing in the book or index about the subject I wanted information on. It seems more of a step-by-step for someone who knows nothing about Word or even how to use Windows, than a ""complete"" reference. The three subjects I looked up (to my disappointment) were: Digital signatures, security, and startup switches."
1,Waste of time to read,The way it is described you would think you would learn some techniques for remembering birth experiences or past life experiences. There is no journey to center self but just a bunch of stories told about other people that remember their past which is completely unentertaining and useless to my life.
4,Finally a upbeat track from TRF.,"With the last two CD Single from TRF being more mid-tempo jams, the group returns with a faster up-beat song titled ""WIRED"".The song was a surprise and lately, with each CD single, you never know what you are going to get with each TRF CD single release.As for the music video if ""WIRED"", Artistically (costume-wise), this is the latest video to feature the group in a different type of setting.Whereas ""Silver & Gold Dance"" (UK version) featured the group in futuristic outfits and YU-KI sporting red hair, ""WIRED"" looks to be in a futuristic world whereas the women are held in cages and YU-KI sporting orange hair.Featuring a lot of dancing and intricate set design, it's interesting to see how the music videos for TRF have become much more interesting to watch.The coupling song ""THE SONG REMAINS THE EARTH"" is an upbeat song written and composed by DJ KOO and the chorus is by YUKI."
5,An Amazing Achievement!,"This book will transform your notion of what technology has done to us as humans. I have read it several times, it is like a bible to me. I highly recommend it!It begins with a complete history of mans resistance to machines, but goes well beyond that. Nicols Fox peppers the entire book with keen insight and her deep thoughts of what we as a race have become; transformed by the mistaken belief that technology and machines have empirically made our lives better and we as humans happier. Yes, they have their place, but we have become enslaved to a dogma that is killing us at an unprecedented rate, while making the rest of us sicker and much less happy.This book should be a textbook in every school in the world!I cannot thank Ms. Fox enough for writing this book, it has truly been a blessing in my life!Thank You So Much!"
2,Live on canned sardines in the wilderness,"According to the book, the Kellams lived a frugal life on their island, subsisting mostly on ""peanuts and sardines."" And they ""wanted no machinery that would require fuel beyond the kerosene and gas lamps."" Well, you don't have to go to a pristine wilderness to live like that. They could just as well have been living in a tenement in New York city, buying their canned sardines and bags of peanuts at the local market and using a bare bulb for light. It is easy to survive in the wilderness if you stockpile enough sardines and kerosene. What would have been a challenge is IF they had attempted to survive on what they could forage, fish, hunt, or grow with the tools they could make (like the Native Americans did). Simplicity is an easy thing if the canning factory is operating, the peanut farmers and merchants are toiling their trades, and one has enough of a pension to purchase those necessities."
5,H2Ocean Ocean Care Tattoo Aftercare Lotion,"H2Ocean Ocean Care Tattoo Aftercare Lotion is my son's product of choice for his after tattoo care. I have also used this product for special attention to dry skin patches. I have also used this product on my face with no problems, and I have sensitive skin. Our family recommends this product, has been using it for about 2 years, and will continue to purchase it."
3,Smells like Newspaper...,"Other than the smell I do really like that its thick, and its a great face lotion. However it didnt do much of anything for my healing tattoos. Their piercing spray is awesome but I dont like the tattoo lotion too much."
4,"Very soothing, needs to be applied more often.","This is a great lotion to use after the initial two or three days of healing have passed. I still find Aquaphor to be my best bet right after being tattooed, but I switch to this as the peeling regresses. It's also less messy, of course, since it is not petroleum-based, and takes the edge of any itching."
4,Good for other skin issues too,"I got this to cure my 2 year old's eczema. The Eczema was very bad when we visited my parents who live on the Great South Bay and a few dips in the bay had it almost cured but once we went home to MN it started coming back. My sister who used to do tattoos recommended H2Ocean and it has kept the Eczema under control since we started using it. Definitely consider using it for other skin problems, all the benefits of the ocean, none of the sand. The merman on the tube is also amusing to the 2 year old crowd."
1,Only because I'm told to use it,"I don't have much confidence in this tattoo cream. It says it moisturizes, but maybe only when you're putting it on. As the title says, I use this only because that's what my tattoo artist says to use. As soon as the tat is healed well enough, I start using other brands of moisturizers."
1,H2Ocean will make your Tattoo look like crap!!,"If you read any tattoo magazines, you may have seen this product advertised and assume it is a good (or AT LEAST decent) product. DON'T BE FOOLED!! Immediately after I got my second tattoo done I went to the counter of the parlor and bought a tube of ""H2Ocean."" After caring for my tattoo as I was told to by the artist AND using this cream exclusively, my tattoo didn' theal properly AND I lost color. If you're looking for a really good aftercare product, I would recommend A+D ointment (the one with brown and gold in the logo). I used this one for my first tattoo and it came out EXCELLENT!! I got a third tattoo less than a week ago and have been trying ""Tattoo Goo"" original (green w/ white background). This smells GREAT, and comes in a small tin (this is a good thing if you don't get a huge tatt) AND so far it seems to be working just as good as A+D (if not better). Not to mention, mt tattoo feels less irritated the when I used A+D.H2OCEAN DOESN'T WORK!!"
5,An Exceptional CD of Gershwin's Music,"Fazil Say demonstrates his familiarity with Gershwin's music in this excellent Teldec CD. Unlike other classically trained pianists who have opted to play Gerswhin as though it was traditional classical music, Say instead performs these scores as the lively, danceable jazz tunes that they are. He does a fine job emphasizing the connections between Gershwin's music and earlier forms of jazz such as ragtime. Indeed Say demonstrates not only his familiarity with Gershwin's scores, but shows he's having much fun playing them. So do the classical musicians who accompany him on several arrangements. Kurt Masur and the New York Philharmonic accompany Say on ""Rhapsody in Blue"" and the variations on ""I Got Rhythm"" with excellent performances of their own. Without question, this is one of the finest CDs I've heard of Gershwin's music performed by classically trained musicians."
1,Quality Lacking,The light did not work and the keys kept falling off the ring holder. I threw the damn thing in the trash. The dealer selling the item was terrible to deal with. I believe Amazon needs to screen their sellers much better.
3,Looks cheaper than in the photos indeed,"I can understand that a US 72.00 pair of shoes isn't a superior quality matter, but I expected more overall. Rubber sole would have been a better description than manmade sole, and i have the hope that black borders and brown pads don't become a problem. The sizes run a little big. I consider these shoes are just ok."
5,Peterson and Miller once again make a great writing team!,"The third book in the Bells of Lowell series captures the story of Daughtie as she fights for the equality of every citizen, regardless of heritage. From the implications of her association with an Irish worker to her stand of beliefs due to workplace conditions, her growth as a woman of independence is tested, as well as her faith. And as friendship grows to love, she risks losing the friendships she's held dear since her new life in Lowell began. In the space a few short years, Daughtie has emerged as a strong young woman, capable of making her own decisions... even ones that those closest to her would view as serious mistakes. A must read for those who have already come to love DAUGHTER OF THE LOOM and A FRAGILE DESIGN, and those who value historical fiction. ~~Ellie Schroder, owner of The Christian Fiction Site"
2,BARBARA CRAMPTON AND KIM EVENSON R HOT ....,THE MOVIE GOES IN SLOW MOTION...AS FAR AS THE PLOT ETC.... ....TRY RE-ANIMATOR IF U LIKE BARBARA CRAMPTON ...THE PRICE WUZ RIGHT ....
1,Is it fun? Depends on who you are,"Young Playmate (Evenson, portraying a 16-year-old she most obviously wasn't) is chloroformed, kidnapped and continually doped-up on heroin while made to do porn.Her ""frantic"" older sister (Crampton) enlists the help of the police, then goes searching on her own while banging the lead detective on the case (Naughton), and enduring assaults from the kidnappers trying to scare her off.Multiple nude scenes with both Evenson (all while stoned) and Crampton will bring smiles to any heterosexual male teenager. However, any adult with a 3-digit IQ will quickly see how stupid and offensive this movie is. Order your copy today. :)How desperate could veteran, steady-working character-actors Lance LeGault and Charles Napier possibly have been to appear in this film??!?"
5,Animation guide for games using Maya,"Interested in game animation for a long time. The book is a good starting point. The book is well written and laid out. Also comes with a educational version of Maya which is a definite plus, which allows anyone to work on 3D animation for games and CGI projects. Definitely recommend for anyone wishing to learn animation for games or otherwise."
2,a mystery,"This book remains a mystery: How did the authors manage to create such a volume without a single reference to the literature? None are given! Other than that, the book is not very readable, but rather a very formal handbook listing definition after definition. The discussions of individual topics are not in-depth enough in order to provide true understanding. Definitely not a must-read."
5,"No creaking, no squeaking, no callus","I tune to C standard and set my amp with medium distortion and some reverb. Trying these strings out helped to reduce noise in transit between chords, and overall these strings do a lot to clean up my sound. The coiled third string does quite a lot to mellow out rhythm guitar playing. Best of all, my calluses haven't been peeling! Chrome was a great choice on D'Addario's part because chrome, being less dense than nickel, compensates for some of the liveliness that players really can't afford to lose in their tone."
3,Not normally a fan,"Read this book for a book club, usually I would never read a book like this as I find them boring. I don't like books that take place in the past, even near past very much, and I don't like character driven narratives where the plot is just an 'average' life story. That said, maybe I've matured, or maybe this book was that good. I actually really enjoyed it. I thought even though some people might not find the characters' actions believable, I did. I was never bored with the story. I remember not liking a few of the characters, but not because they were poorly written, just because I didn't like their actions. So I didn't like them in a good way."
3,let me rate movies on the product page w/o writing a review!,"For some inexplicable reason, Amazon has removed the rate-movie feature from the main product page. One must now write a review in order to rate a movie and generate recommendations. This is not a review, but merely a means to allow me to rate this movie and improve my recommendations. If you are as annoyed by this new ""feature"" as I am, please register your protest w/ Amazon help."
4,Lost commentary,"I first saw this film on TV, in which the funniest thing was a retrospective voice-over commentary by Chesser (Charles Grodin's character) about the whole affair. The film is still good, but it was SO much better with the commentary. It seems like it has something missing now. I have put the tape I bought in a dusty cupboard and will watch the ancient taped TV version until the publishers think about releasing the better version."
4,"Clever and Entertaining ""Graduate"" Spy Caper","This is a ""new generation"" spy caper, with Charles Grodin (who co-wrote the screenplay and narrates) as a Dustin Hoffman, Graduate-era slacker low-level diamond broker who falls into an elaborate plot to steal diamonds from a massive London diamond conglomerate led by John Gieglud. Grodin's partner-in-crime is a Carnaby Street, freewheeling ""new age"" woman played by Candice Bergen, in striking, mod clothes -- who drives race cars and service trucks equally and with great skill.Filmed in England, with a decidedly ""English"" feel, this is a thoroughly enjoyable spy caper, with a smart sense of humor and stylish direction, set design, and music. In fact, the music -- also mod, Brit, and hip -- is one of the highlights. Add James Mason and the great Trevor Howard and you have an overlooked gem of a film, eagerly waiting a decent DVD re-release.Fox, what are you waiting for?"
2,A Terrible Adaptaion of a Pretty Decent Little Book,"After reading 11 Harrowhouse by Gerald A. Browne, I was anxious to see the film. If I hadn't read the book, there is no way I would have known or cared what was going on on screen. The adaptation into the film was done so poorly it is a true shame. Charles Grodin in no way represented my idea of Chesser - not by any stretch of the imagination. And not only did Candice Bergen illustrate the polar opposite personality to that of Marin in the book; but to watch her twist and roil her way through her idea of ""acting"" was both boring and painful at the same time. Please, folks, read the book. Steer clear of the movie."
4,The key to enjoying this movie .....,"... is to be prepared to watch it at least twice without distraction. This kind of humor is the ""long-term love"" that grows over time rather than the ""one-night stand"" that immediately burns out. Christopher Guest is a brilliant improvisational talent who surrounds himself with other such capable actors for his projects. There is rarely a script, per se, and the humor in the film comes from the rich and layered, realistic-but-oddball, ad-libbed character portrayals and development in fairly simple life situations. Add sight gags and subtle puns that are never ""in your face"" like laugh-track, sit-com humor, and you create a masterpiece that never grows stale."
5,Incredibly funny!,"I've seen this movie five times & each time laughed until I cried. Christopher Guest is a genius. The movie is well cast. The fact that it is mostly ad-lib makes the characters wonderfully human and wonderfully funny. And in the midst of all this humor, there is a beautiful love song composed by Christopher Guest, that while performed in a comical setting, is very moving. Adult subject of one conversation perhaps gives it its ""R"" rating, and there is a small amount of foul language, but none are offensive and all are handled comically & tastefully. I highly recommend this movie."
5,Very Very Funny,"If you liked Spinal Tap or Best in Show, you will like this.If you didn't, you won't.In my opinion, Waiting for Guffman surpasses Best in Show, though the latter was higher on the public radar. In any case, the recent release of A Mighty Wind is very encouraging, particularly in the continued use of much of the same cast. Each installment of the Christopher Guest Troupe is like a highly refined cinematic Carol Burnett Show.My only complaint about this DVD is that it would have been relatively easy to provide an ""uninterrupted version"" of Red, White & Blaine. While you can get almost the entirety of the fake musical through the main movie & additional scenes, it requires some jumping around. I presume that this footage actually exists somewhere, and the fake musical is so successfully done that it could almost stand on its own."
5,"Funnier than ""Best In Show""","Ok, I really liked Christopher Guest's ""Best In Show"", but ""Waiting For Guffman"" almost made me pee my pants. The cast is terrific (basically the same cast of ""Best In Show""), Christopher Guest has literally created mastered a new genre of comedy, the ""mockumentary"". First, he helped write Rob Reiner's ""This is Spinal Tap"", then wrote & directed ""Waiting for Guffman"", & most recently, ""Best In Show"". Experience a little bit of comic genius...BUY THIS ONE."
2,Waiting For Laughter,"After viewing Christopher Guest's superb mockumentary ""Best In Show"" this film was a major disappointment. The laughs in ""Waiting for Guffman"" were sporadic and obvious. Guest's Corky St. Claire character's flamboyance was a little much. The depiction of Middle America was condescending if not outright insulting. The normally reliable ensemble cast(Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, Fred Willard, Parker Posey) could not even transcend the weak material they were given to work with. The centerpiece of the film, a community theatre production commemmorating the history of the fictional town of Blaine, was flat and boring and not even remotely funny. I'm grateful that a talent like Guest rebounded from this misfire in his directorial debut to do better work."
3,"Overated with a capital ""O"".","I do understand that this movie is fresh and inventive but that's about it. A few laughs here and there but short of expectation. Particularly after seeing Best in Show, which is much funnier.OK, they have fairly captured the whole community theatre thing, but that in itself doesn't make this film funny. And I'm sorry, but Christopher Guest's character is as irritating as a sack full of mosquitos. The sudden recent success of this movie is little more than a monument to the Y chromosome shrinkage in this country. Wish I hadn't bought this. 3 tickets to Peking, to get me as far away from Blaine as possible. And I'm being kind."
1,"""what did your keen and perceptive eyes behold?""","Well there you have the 2 seconds in the movie that I laughed at...Unfunny Fred Willard with that line and Eugene Levy's lazy eye lol....the rest of the movie suffered from 'overfarcity' :) . It's like, when you know what your gonnna get, and especially after watching Spinal Tap, the situations can ONLY be mildy amusing at best, because 'forced farce' loses it's steam real quicklike..."
1,Waiting fo rGuffman,"Well I like a broad range of films but this film is probably the worst I have ever seen. I sat there waiting for it to get into some sort of story but it didn't. It was like pulling teeth! I couldn't believe I had waisted my time. I purchased the DVD because of the good rating but boy was I wrong. I know English and American humour is different but I can't believe this is popular in the States!Boring, boring, boring, what else can I say."
1,Waiting for Guffman,"To be quite honest, I really didn't like the movie. It didn't grab my attention, I found it boring and I completely lost interest after the first 5 minutes. I didn't find the movie moving or funny."
2,"Unfunny, overall a desperate attempt at humor","I dont understand why this film is such a cult classic. It had funny acting, but there wasnt hardly any plot to it, and none of it was funny. it is far from a masterpeice- I think it is over credited from the direction of Christopher Guest and its limited release of only 64 theatres. My friends said that this movie was so hilarious-the portrayal of a small town and white trash. Well to say the least their humor must be a bit primitive. I have nothing against low-budgeted films, but this documentary film was incredibly boring. I dont reccomend this to anyone. Its a terrible attempt at humor beginning to end."
2,Not as good as Best In Show,"Christopher Guest's mockumentary is about a small town theatre group that puts on a play and invites a famous Broadway critic, Guffman, to attend. The would-be stars all have grand illusions of being discovered by Guffman, and making a big splash in show biz.A lot of people find this film hilarious; I didn't. I never cared about what these characters were going through; they seemed way too stereotypical and phony and the actors just weren't believable. They weren't sweet, innocent, or endearing; they were boring.If you want to see most of the same actors in a much better mockumentary, also written and directed by the Guest, see Best in Show. It is hilarious."
2,"Coulda, Shoulda, wasn't...","This movie... well, 'mocumentary', is hard to get excited about.It's like the guys behind this movie figured that they find theatre boring, so they'd go and make a movie about how boring theatre is - and the people in it.At the start there's all these staged 'interviews' of the various characters, you feel like you're watching a documentary about a small town. After a while, the 'movie' gets going, and it's kind of interesting, especially the bit when they finally do the show.It's vaguely ironic, and yes, satirical, but in a most obvious, telegraphed way. There's no jokes, no slapstick, no real ideas... they pin all their hopes on the satire, and, after a while, the desperation to be oddball grows tiring."
5,it doesn't get any better than this!,"I can't name another movie that had me laughing from the opening moments to the very end without stopping. I saw this a few years ago when it first came out. Now that it's in video, I've rented it again and it's still funny. Guest is hilarious as a small town director with high aspirations. For my money, this is even funnier than Spinal Tap and holds up better as a mock-umentary. Everyone is in the groove here and every performance is noteworthy. For fans of Guest, be sure not to miss this year's Best in Show which he also directs. You'll get to watch him play a macho guy with a southern drawl who is in love with his bloodhound! Don't miss this film either if you're in the mode for a good laugh and some seriously funny film-making."
5,Nothing ever Happens on Mars.....,First off I LOVE PARKER POSEY. But that's another story envolving wips and chains. This is one of the funniest movies EVER. Fred Willard kills me. Corky St.Claire is the next Andrew Lloyd Webber.
5,Your'e not wrong!,"'ell 'ole- A nod to the second funniest film ever, This is Spinal Tap. Actually the two finest films of all time regardless of genre. It is hard to pick out favorite lines but ""dances w/ Stumpy is way up there! Also I have never seen deer hooves like that either! Incomparable, umbelievably funny and totally indispensable viewing. There are 5 letters in Blaine. I plan on owning a theatre and Waiting for Guffman will be my midnite movie for the ages - even if I am the only one watching!"
3,Guffman,"I thought this movie was the perfect representation of small town life. In every scene there was something to laugh about! Christopther Guest (Corky) gets together a couple of the town's-people and puts together a play. He thinks it is his ticket back to Broadway! Even thought the actors in the play were horrible, they all think they are presenting the show of a lifetime! Just hillarious!"
5,One of the funniest films going.,"Waiting for Guffman is absolutely uproarious. There are few films with quite as much humor, energy and spirit as this one. Watching it, you find yourself not only laughing at the characters, but really sympathizing with them and rooting for them.This is one of the best comedies going."
2,I just don't get it,"This movie is very similar to the directors other popular film, Best of Show. I don't really understand the overwhelming praise for either of these films. The problem with it is there really isn't much outright humor and I don't think I cracked a smile more than once the whole movie. I'd say its more overall amusing than it is funny. Several reviews of this film stated that the viewers were 'rolling on the floor with laughter'. This completely confuses me as there isn't a single scene that presents enough of a comic situation that you could really laugh out loud at it. I understand the type of humor that he is trying to achieve in the movie, it just totally misses its mark on me. I guess I'll stay away from future Guest films as I just don't find anything remotely funny about them and they are as boring as watching a real documentary."
2,Kind of tedius - not that good,"This movie dragged. Just so you know where I'm coming from I liked Spinal Tap, A Mighty Wind, and Best In Show. This one's worth skipping."
2,NOT MY THING,"I enjoy most comedies, this one I don't. If you don't want to laugh outloud this movie is great."
4,SOOOOO FUNNY.,This movie is sopposed to be A biogrophy on A man (or is he??)making A play about the town of blaine (who is known for there stools)Its funny but it's really dirty.I also reccomend what about boband best in show.
2,"really, not that funny","Might be ok for a rental, but all these great reviews are misleading. It's a long string of understatement and purposely anticlimactic punch lines. It's an interesting exercise, but the joke's on the viewer. There's a reason you haven't heard of this movie before."
2,Interesting,"I am sorry for the other riviewers, I thought the movie was original, and well acted, but also boring and meaningless.This is unless, you are really into homosexual, and feminine men.The beautiful Parker Posey, was a good actor and beautiful as always.I would not buy it or rent it, unless everything else slightly viewable fos already gone."
2,WHAT IS EVERYONE ELSE SEEING HERE?,"I bought this video because the reviews were overwhelmingly good. Personally, I just don't see what everyone is raving about. Yes, the acting was great, but that's it. No fascinating story. No fascinating characters. If you want a really funny film about a small-town production, get ""A Midwinter's Tale."" It is far superior to ""Waiting for Guffman"" in every aspect."
2,If you like small towns,"A new comedy from the Lead Guitarist of ""Spinal Tap"". I found it slow and ended to soon. Only 84 minutes. Rather of rented this one."
5,A MUST FOR ANYONE INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY THEATRE!!!!,"This is one of the funnier movies I've ever seen and I readily agree with the other reviewers who advise that this flick will have you laughing off your seat! And - if you're involved in community theater (or theatre), you will recognize people you have auditioned or worked with over the years!"
5,Funny stuff.,"This is a really great and hilarious movie. If you're a Christopher Guest fan, and you like ""Spinal Tap"" and ""A Mighty Wind"", you'll love this one as well. It's got a lot of the same people that are always in his movies, like Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara, and they're all always great together. Also, David Cross is hilarious as the UFO nut.Definitely buy this movie. And don't forget to pick up a ""Remains of the Day"" lunchbox while you're at it."
4,Spinal Tap for Theatre,"I bought this movie based on the reviews. I wasn't entirely sure what to expect, but I was thinking that there would be more hilarity. Don't get me wrong, this is a funny movie, but it isn't Jim Carey. It is more like a cross between Spinal Tap and a string of Saturday Night Live skits (some of them uncofortable to watch). Most scenes, on their own, aren't particularly funny, but as a whole it has a sort of low key humor that is very appealing. Just don't expecting rolling on the floor, peeing your pants laughter. Tell yourself that you are more sophisticated than that!Be sure to check out the two pages of deleted scenes -- some of them are really great."
3,Some pretty good Acting Skills,"Waiting for Guffman had it moments. To say the least, it was funny to see all the characters get in to their parts. None of them had talent at all. Even the director, Corky St. Claire, lacked much talent. But all they characters had enthusiasm and really made the documentary funny at times. The best part of the film was the play itself. I finally got to see the end product of all their hard work. This is not a documentary that I would highly recommend you run out and get, but if you are in the mood for some dry humor, then I would say you should spend an hour in a half watching it. It will make you laugh."
3,not as good of a quality as I thought,"I expected a higher quality box. i wanted to give this as a gift but can not. Dvd played no problem. If i was buying this for myself i would say 4-5 stars but as a gift, not so much."
4,Great,"Don't judge this movie the first time you watch it, because you may not like it. If you keep watching it, you will begin to love it, and pretty soon you won't be able to stop watching it. It is hilarious, but not quite as strong as Best In Show. This isn't slapstick humor, it is a very heartwarming story that makes you laugh along the way."
5,Highly quotable and infectious,"Maybe I'm simple minded, but this kind of comedy gets me every time. This unblinking documentary about a small town's theatrical troubles will give you a great deal to identifyand laugh with . All of us know someone in this movie. All of us are someone in this movie. Stop thinking about it and hit ""add to my shopping cart"". This is a fun movie If you don't laugh, get your head checked. This is good fun in the heart of America."
4,Still Funny...,"Having worn out my VHS version of ""Guffman"" I looked forward to the new DVD.With each viewing I find myself laughing at the same parts aswellas discovering something new.The deleted scenes that were on the DVD were great. The high points being a twisted monologue by Parker Posey and two songs from ""Red, White, and Blaine"" that for some bizarre reason didn't make the final film.The DVD also contains a commentary by Director Guest and Writer Eugene Levy. As funny as the two of them are on film their commetaries are strangely dry and tedious. The one negative for the DVD (Hence the 4 stars)."
1,"We Unanimously Hated this Movie, Beware of Positive Review","I cannot believe how boring this Movie was. I had a very diverse crowd over to watch this DVD on my big front projection theater. Everybody was getting so annoyed and flat faced we had to turn it off after 45 minutes. I am absolutely amazed at the positive reviews. In my opinion, this movie is simply boring. It was far worse than State and Main. It was State and Main crossed with Best in Show, except that it took the worst parts of EACH. Every character was forced and not humorous. I've seen far better Saturday night Live Skits (the current Saturday Night Live). I've given this film too much credit already by even attempting to compare it with the above mentioned films.Berst in Show was a 3/5 star movie. State and Main was around a 2/5 Satr movie, in my opinion. I cannot give this any higher than 1.5 stars."
3,Not Aging Well,"It is not aging well. The brightest spots are actually some very moving scenes with parker Posey. I love Guest, but this wears thin early."
2,It Was Alright,"I'll start off by saying that I love and own This is Spinal Tap. I also thought that Best in Show was really funny and that A Mighty Wind was worthy of a rental. But this Christopher Guest movie just didn't live up to my expectations, which were based on other reviews that called this movie Guest's best. Well, it's not. It's got a few moments in it that made me laugh, but overall the movie was filled with too much boring stuff. Usually these movies will have plenty to laugh about, and there will be an occasional joke that doesn't work well.But in Waiting for Guffman, there's too much that doesn't even seem to try to be funny. Instead it paints a picture of how boring these characters are, which would work if it were made to be funny, but it isn't. This movie seemed like a good premise for a movie that could have had a lot of funny bits in it, but it didn't take advantage of that."
4,"""Waiting For Guffman"" Well Worth Waiting For","What ""Spinal Tap"" did for heavy metal, ""Waiting for Guffman"" does for Middle America. Blaine, Missouri is celebrating the 150 year anniversary of its accidental founding, and the residents of the homely little town prove as dimwitted as their ancestors.Christopher Guest, past master of the mockumentary, plays an erstwhile Broadway director named Corky with such deadpan precision as to make his precious few moments on screen some of the funniest in film. Indie queen Parker Posey turns up as a Dairy Queen worker-cum-dancer, while a host of lesser stars portray the dumb-yet-wholesome cast of the musical.If the ""Stonehenge"" scene in ""Spinal Tap"" still makes you howl, imagine an entire movie built around cheesy staging and terrible music. Grab this movie now---God only knows what Blaine's bicentennial will be like."
3,"Fun, But Not Guest's Best","When I found out about this title from Christopher Guest and his improv gang, I moved it to the top of my rental list. Guffman was enjoyable, but didn't quite measure up to ""Best in Show"", in my opinion, Guest's best movie, though I've yet to see ""A Mighty Wind."" The ""mockumentary"" of a small town theatrical production in the Blaine, Missouri, ""The Stool Capitol of the World"" seemed a little too close to a real documentary, other than Guest's slightly over-the-top portrayal of off-off-off Broadway-based director Corky St. Clair (previous credit--""Backdraft"" for the stage). For me, the highlight came after the story ended, when Corky went back to New York to open his show biz memorabilia shop. What kid wouldn't want a ""My Dinner with Andre"" action set or a ""Remains of the Day"" lunchbox?"
5,Superior Character Study,"Some may have viewed this sleeper after being drawn in by ""Best in Show"". However, the earlier character study in Guffman is superior to any I've viewed. The first time you see it, it is hilarious. The second, third or fourth time, you just sit open-mouthed at the sheer talent portraying amusing and unlikely characters that may just exist across the U.S. or the planet Earth."
2,I really wanted to love this movie!,"As a huge fan of the movies ""Best in Show"" and ""For Your Consideration"", I was so excited when I came across another Christopher Guest movie featuring many of the same players. I truly wanted to love this movie, but to me it just fell flat. The first time I watched it, I fell asleep half way through! I have managed to stay awake to watch it three times since just to be sure I wasn't missing some underlying comic theme, but to no avail. In the other Guest films I've viewed, the pace is fast and the humor appears effortless and natural. In ""Waiting For Guffman"", the comedy is forced and contrived, and the movie seemed to drag on forever. It's like the actors are trying too hard to be funny, and failing miserably. That's not to say there weren't a few humorous moments in the movie, but I would recommend renting this movie first before purchasing."
2,Guffman review,"This movie was somewhat comical, but lacks any real interest. Nothing really happens that makes the viewer actually want to see more. The only part that I thought was pretty good was the actual play itself. The part with the aliens was very funny. I did not like the fact that no one liked the music teacher and everyone liked the other guy. The fact that I cannot remember his name only reinforces the fact that he didn't really interest me. It did not seem fair that he did not listen to any of the music teacher's comments. The movie didn't show why the actors and actresses liked that guy so much. Why did they love him? Was he that great of a guy? These are questions that should be answered in the movie. If they are not, the viewer is left clueless to many things."
5,Funniest commentary on small town America yet,Christopher Guest is a genius and I love him for this movie. I will not tell you exactly what this movie is about because it could ruin for you. I will just say that if you do not buy this movie you will be missing out on one of the best comedies of all time.
3,Review for Waiting for Guffman,"I enjoyed this ""Moc-U-Mentary"". Although I probably never would have opted to see it on my own (seen in a college classroom setting), I really did enjoy it. I thought that the characters were funny and played out very well by the actors. I would have to say my favorite character was the choreographer/director of the play. Also, despite the fact that the towns-people participating in the production were clueless as to their lack of talent, the outcome of the play was great!"
5,So funny you'll bite your pillow!,"This is my favorite comedy ever! The characters are hilarious, especially Corky St. Clair. I'd love to see the same cast do another movie together, because they're all so great. It puts me in a silly mood every time I see it!"
4,Definitely a very funny movie,"This one was good but not great. I own it and enjoy the movie but it doesn't quite hit the 5 star level for me. I think if you like the ""mockumentary"" genre, you'll like this one though."
4,It's SOOO true!!!,"As someone who has been in community theater for awhile, I couldn't help but laugh at this movie. In a comic and exaggerated way, it catches the essence of non-pro theater. It's hilarious how the characters try to pretend to be pros at acting. My favorite part was the auditions scene. Each audition was as terrible(and gut-bustingly funny) as the next, just like real auditions. If you've ever directed, acted, or involved yourself in community theater at all, you'll LOVE this movie. Get ready to laugh!!!"
5,excellent waist pouch !!,"Fits nice on waist, quite comfortable, you don't even feel whether you are wearing it. keeps phone, music player and other stuff safe."
5,"Perfect for carrying diabetic supplies for a kid, washes well.","I bought this for my niece to carry her diabetes supplies (meter, glucose tabs etc). It is perfect for this. Straps are small enough to fit her waist and it does not bounce around all over the place. Very, very durable, this kid is hard on stuff and it has lasted a year (in rotation with one other)Also washes up really well."
5,Super convenient and comfortable!,"I have used this jogging, walking, and bike-riding. I usually put my keys and my cell phone in it, and I clip my pepper spray onto the strap. The pack fits very comfortably with easily adjustable straps. It is very light weight and doesn't shift around much. It is not bulky at all. I did notice when I had heavier items in it like my phone (which is probably heavier then the average cell phone these days) that it did bounce a bit when I jogged. But I am generally very happy with my purchase. I do recommend this product!"
1,Don't bother!,This book was NOTHING like what I expected. The author leads you to believe she was thrusted into a traumatic experience that changed her life. Her experience dealing with plane crash victim's families was brief and inconsequential! It appears she wanted to benefit financially from an event she was only slightly involved in. I'd give it 0 stars if I could.
5,Exit Row,"Being a Volunteer of an Emergency Response Team, this book has been an eye opener as to what really happens in real life. Tammy, thank you for such a vivid and detailed information of your journey that we all Volunteers hope never have to go through."
2,very very very very disappointed,"This version of Axum (6) definitely is much much less than what it purports to be. It may have had all the bells and whistles in terms of plotting power (I have not tried all), but the user interface is terribly not friendly. You can try this: make a graph, then go to print setup to change page from landscape to portait. If you luckily go through, then go to undo, or go to print setup to change back to landscape, 9 out of 10 times you will be errorred out. Also try this, make a scatter (x, y1, y2, y3, y4.....y10) plot, then try to change all datapoints to the same symbols. It certainly takes at least 10 tedious steps to accomplish this. In summary, I strongly suggest you stay away from it if you have the option."
2,?1 or 3?,"Not sure what I bought; thought it was 3, but only got one. Description says blades, picture shows three, and after further review, the 3 pack is the exact same description. Or, is this the same blade for a higher price? Would like to have some extra blades, but this description isn't clear on the 24 tpi."
1,Political correctness comes to clay country.,A reporter at an ultra-liberal Atlanta newspaper and an aide for a Congresswoman who spends her summers helping Fidel Castro harvest his sugar cane crop have teamed up to offer a predictably biased account of the Kaolin Industry in Georgia.You might as well get out your little red book of the sayings of Mao-tse-tung as waste your time on this tripe.
3,"Good plot, simplistic language","Ms. Smith has her strong points - modernizing character and plot for one. All six of the books in this series kept me reading to the end because of the really smart plots loosely based on Austen's novels.However, the writing style is too distracting from the novel and makes the reader too aware of the novel. For example, the main character reads an email and then goes to get ready for a visitor. Instead of simply putting her laptop down, we have to read an entire paragraph describing how she uses ""a series of clicks"" to close the ""machine"" down. The novel-speak is very freshman literature ""how to write a novel"" and takes away from what could have been a great read."
5,Wonderful adaption!,"So far in this series, Debra White Smith has taken liberties with dropping 'extra' characters and siblings, changing what jobs people have, and even changing how people are related to one another. None the less, I look for how well the characteristics, motives, and interactions of the characters stay true to the Jane Austen stories despite all these changes. Honestly, I loved this modernization and felt that she kept all the characters true as well as keeping all those favorite moments from Mansfield Park even if the settings had changed. This is my favorite of Smith's 'Austen Series' so far."
1,LIst the name of the movies,"I thought it contained Dr. No, Goldfinger, and From Russia with Love as another reviewer wrote. When the videos arrived, the set instead contained You Only Live Twice, Diamonds are Forever, and Thunderball. Beware"
4,Names of Videos in the Set,"When I bought this set from CloseOutVideo, I thought it contained Dr. No, Goldfinger, and From Russia with Love as another reviewer wrote. When the videos arrived, the set instead contained You Only Live Twice, Diamonds are Forever, and Thunderball. Beware: Who knows what videos you might get?!?"
1,Invictus: In the Shadow of Olympus,"If you were thinking about baldur's gate like game this is not what you were looking for! This game is titled as an RPG game but it is not! The game provides a very limited RPG system(like myth 2 more or less) and it functions,looks like a --strategy-- game and not like an RPG game. Altough there are heros they are very similar to the 'normal' units. In addition the game is mission based(like a typical strategy game)and the only diffrecne between this game to a startegy game is the fact that your heros can gain XP points(and the quantity of those doesn't change). I have played 5 missions and they all were bascly the same . This game is a much RPG as myth and myth has better graphics and is a better buy then this. I would not buy this game."
3,Invictus: Shadow of Olympus,This game has an overall good plot but that cannot cover up for technical difficulty. It is not as easy to install as say Myth 1 or Myth 2. It has frequent freazes which takes your mind off of the actual game.
2,Like a bad telenovela,"As soon as one realizes this movie is shot on videotape and not film one's heart sinks. Like a bad telenovelo, scenes go on and on and all one wants to do is yell ""Cut"" to the director. The story is familiar: a prostitute who works johns on a train, drugs them and steals their money, one night hits the jackpot -- two suitcases crammed with money being transported by a courier out of Spain. Tracked down by an agent hired by a crooked banker, a relationship evolves between the hooker and the agent, who double crosses her, then backtracks -- only to be double crossed in return. A tired story that appears to have been lifted from countless other, better written scripts, this flick has the look and feel of an el-cheapo Mexican outing. Good Spanish actors wasted in a movie that looks like a hastily thrown together production."
3,The acting is not so good.,"I really didn't enjoy this movie, the acting was really bad. I wouldn't recommend this movie."
4,Not Seeing Double,"This documentary shows how identical twins are created. However, it discusses many pairs of identical twins who look nothing alike. For example, they showed identical twins in which one twin was just half the size of the other. The point is that numerous factors during pregnancy can affect the twins differently. As a person who hates science, I found this work friendly, rather than science-dorky. I would consider giving this as a gift to people who are twins."
3,Informative...but not what I was thinking,"I thought the DVD would be more about the interaction between the twins in the WOMB, before they are born. But it's mosty about how they end up looking different, and acting different through out life, and in not too deep of an explianation."
4,Lazy days are here again,"Very large and comfortable. My dogs come up on it and snuggle with me. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because by the end of the season a couple of the stringers had frayed and broken, but it was still sturdy enough to continue using. I did leave it out all the time though so it did withstand severe Florida elements. Hot, hot days, rain, my sprinkler system, etc. So if you took better care of it than I did, it would probably last better."
1,Take your money and ...,"...walk into your bathroom. Lift commode lid. Place money in bowl. Flush. Then go out and buy something that works, all the while saying to yourself, ""You get what you pay for"" and, alternately, ""Caveat Emptor.""Like your PDFs minus the graphics? Buy this. Like your fonts screwed up? Step right over here.What a joke this thing is. Thankfully I got it on sale. There oughta be a law."
1,Virus Warning,"I bought this at BJ's on 4/15/2010, and when I installed it, I got numerous virus alerts and I hard a difficult time removing it. When I emailed Cosmi to report the problem and at least get a refund, I never got a response."
1,Bait and switch,"The box may say ""PDF Creator"", but the program you now get is ""PDF Master"", which is a different program, with different and fewer capabilities. And don't even think of trying their soi disant ""technical support"". Unanswered emails. Three hour phone call queues. Surly ""assistants"" who insist that the two programs really are the same even when their own literature says otherwise.Save yourself time, money and aggravation - don't buy this. Make your life really easy - just don't buy ANYTHING from Cosmi!"
4,Excellent Tea,"This tea is of good quality, and quite tasty. It is vegetal and sweet, with a medium body. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is that the leaves were a little bit broken - an issue I seem to have with most varieties of Japanese green tea. I was hoping that leaves processed in this style would fare a little better to shipping than sencha and they did, but not a whole lotEDITAfter a few more days, my opinion of this tea has only gone up. You absolutely need to steep this tea at least twice. The first time for 1-2 minutes, and the second for 30-45 seconds. The first steeping seems to extract a lot of the bitter and tannic components which hide the real flavor. The second steeping although short, its much more flavorful than the first"
2,Sunday school,"This book was alright, but to man made for me. To much of man's doctrine instead of God's doctrine."
3,"Good, but get Crimson and Blue instead.","This CD is a good rock insturmental CD, but really has no incredible guitar magic. Sure, it has a couple cool songs, but I would recommend Crimson and Blue over this as a good Keaggy rock album. While the songs are well written, it does not capture the trademark Keaggy sound, and if I did not already know how incredible Phil Keaggy is, I would not have ranked him as a virtuoso. My favorite songs are Watt Ever, The Great Escape, and Stomp."
4,One of my favorite Phil CDs...,"Along with Lights of Madrid, 220 is one of my favorite Phil Keaggy CDs. The album starts out with a great rock track-Animal. Arrow and The Great Escape are also some of my favorite cuts off this album. The album is all instrumental, but Phil makes up for the lyrics with his guitar. Phil Keaggy is indeed a great, great guitarist, and this album shows it. However, some of the tracks don't have any structure and just seem like Phil's jammin with his band, which is fine, it's just that those tracks don't compare to the ones with some structure like Animal. I know I know, I'm a picky kinda guy."
4,Phil letting the creativity flow,"This is not a ""band"" album, but there are some awesome moments. This is Phil's boundless creativity unleashing, much like the more recent ""On the Fly"". Of course, every keaggy fan will love it, and newcomers will have a wonderful introduction to some of the music of the world's greatest guitarist."
5,Great Introduction for New Conspirators,"I received this book in the mail yesterday, and I was done reading it by 10 PM that night. It was a very easy, concise read. I would recommend it for those who are just beginning their journey into Advent Conspiracy.If, however, you know a lot about AC already, then I suggest you save your money and give it to Living Water International in the name of someone you love and care about.Overall, it was a GREAT book, and I would love to see families, youth groups, and Sunday school classes start going through it together."
3,Starts slowly and gets much more positive,"This book was provided by the Advent Conspiracy in exchange for a review.When I was first reading this book I was going to title the review, Pack your bags we're going on a guilt trip. The first part of the book is a screed against comsumerism and a guilt trip towards the audience. It feels like a really condemnatory sermon. The tone changes as the book goes on and paints a great picture of how advent conspiracy can change us, our family, our church and internationally. The more I read the more I liked the book, the book took on a more positive tone as it went on. The last two year the church we attend has taken part in Advent Conspiracy. Last year we spent less and donated to the charity our church was sponsoring to give clean water to people around the world. Overall this was a good book, I would like to see a more positive beginning. RRr"
5,Great book in great condition,Book gives you many things to consider - I would highly recommend it. Its a quick read and worth the time.
2,Advent Dissppoints,Seemed prosaic and speared to promote an agenda of giving to Living Waters charity. It didn't feel authentic or spiritual.
3,No more than OK,"This volume did not have the pizzaz the Victorian fonts book had. Modernique, Plaza Suite, Clyde are interesting. If you have Broadway (or B'way Engraved), Futura Black (or Braggadocio) on your machine that should suffice. My Broadway has better kerning than these Dover ones also: test was ""VA"" overlap. All in all we've seen better. Still looking forward to the next book though!"
2,Not Worth It,"This was the first clip art package I purchased, and I wish that I'd made a different choice. First of all, the images are not terribly high quality. The vector image can't be used in other program. The browser application is non-instinctive, and does not allow you to view thumbnails of images without actually changing disks every time you want to search a different category. There are a few images, photographs, mostly that are usable, but the majority of them look dated and ill-concieved.My recommendation is to check out Big Box of Art. A much better product at pretty much the same price."
1,Major Letdown,"I purchased this book hoping to learn new, fresh and interesting twists to old ideas.But I didn't learn much at all. It's all pretty basic stuff.I suppose for a beginner or someone that needs an extra boost of confidence it may supply the needed guidelines.Otherwise, look elsewhere."
1,What?? flava mix?,"I'm a big fan of Jewel and I'm in the process of collecting all her albums, single and merchandise until I came through this single review. Is it that bad? If it is true I think its somebody else fault, maybe the producer. But no thank you though... the item is not available anymore."
5,Brutalllllllllllllllllll,"Amazing Death Grindgore Metal. Very melodic and brutallll. The first song i heard was The Saw and the Carnage done and became my favorite Grindgore band. If there heavy ass riffs dont whet your appetite then there lyrics will and the vocals provided by Sven are amazing, from the low groans to the screams for feeding. Lyric wise it is what you'd expect from a band called aborted, gorrrrre. They even throw in some audio clips of awesome horror movies which include Dead Alive, Evil dead and Day of the dead. It is everything you could want from a Grindgore metal band from Belgium, I really dont think it could get much better. Highly recommended, Haematobic and if you can find it ""The Purity of Perversion"""
1,Aborted ? More like aboredted,"I was actullie looking forward to bang my head to aborted's goremageddon, but it just did not happen. I gave it a chance but insted it just plain bored me at best! Terrible production as well as lirycs but one star for the album cover, i quess. I realy never been so bored in my life while listining to an album except when i listing to crappy songs from deicide or bloodbath. For good gore music play anything from gorguts,exhumed, &,gorerotted but skip aborted please!"
5,Perfect size for tiny hands,"I bought this for my 6 month old nephew. He uses the same one in physical therapy, and he just adores it. The sound is just endlessly fascinating to him!"
3,"Another misunderstood movie, worth to be re-evaluated","The plot of this movie is excellent and meaningful. It takes us behind the golden faades of the Vatican's walls and makes us take a plunge into its controversial policies and hipocritical acts. The only thing that ruins the plot is a love story of the main character à la ""Torn Birds"", which is meant as a ""reminder"" to us, that even priests have a heart (well, we know already). For the rest, the movie is flawless, and follows a very sinister path that at times crosses into true facts, which unfortunately, did happen. Christopher Reeve plays convincingly. Absolutely not recommended for those who ""believe"" in the Church. For all the others, it is a worthy insight into the machineries of power and corruption, even among the Holy Walls. To you, the final judgment..."
3,i can't tell you why but this is a very fun movie if you let it be,"i don't know why i like it but i do! this is grade a cheese here but it is also a great soap opera, and i though that mr. reeve's acting was good. if you let it i think you may like it."
2,Pure Camp,"Except for the ""shocking"" premise, the movie doesn't have much to go on. Suprisingly slow moving considering the supposed drama of the corruption and the affair. Reeve, God bless his soul(pardon the pun)was handed a real doozy of a role. At times reverential to the Vatican,this character slides into a bizarre method-acted version of Gordon Gecko. How this person could ever exist is beyond me. Plus, I never really caught onto why the Monsignor is so ambitiously greedy anyway. Seems as if he would have gone to B-School instead of the clergy. Oh well, at least he's not chasing little boys...Best scene: Nun discovers the awful truth during a ""all-hands"" Vatican visitation of the Pope."
1,"Laughable, Ridiculous, and Horribly long.","This is a horrible horrible movie. I saw it at the theatre, and I spent the entire long horrible process laughing at it. In fact, the entire theatre (except for the woman sitting next to me) was laughing and hurling out comments (It was like being on Mystery Science Theatre!).This movie was supposed to be controversial, but it was laughable, horribly written and horribly acted. When Reeve deadpanned ""I only have an hour"" as he an his nun girlfriend prepared to get cosy (Right across from the Vatican), the entire theatre (save one) burst into laughter, and a man at the back of the theatre yelled out ""He's faster than a speeding bullet.""I enjoyed the experience of seeing this in a theatre because we all had such fun laughing at this movie (Similarly to Starship Troopers), but I would NEVER want to own this movie. What a waste of money."
2,Read the Editorial Review- It's on target,"Saw this on TV last night. Agree with the Editorial review on this product page:Amazon.comOne of the all-time great bad movies, a pricelessly funny piece of cheese about a priest who not only breaks his vows of celibacy but gets chummy with the Mafia."
2,The watch is not the size that this picture makes it out to be.,"I ordered two of these watches, one for myself and one for a friend. This watch is big enough for my 6 year old son. Very disapointed with the product. I am currently deployed in IRAQ and cant do anything about this situation right now but intend on getting my money back for this product. Will try to order another two watches from another company."
4,Right On!,"Great stuff for my kids... even better for me! I'm gonna get big mileage out of this with my two sons and what the heck, I admit, I dig the Bare Naked Ladies and Ben Folds Five tunes too."
1,Worst. Gum. Ever.,"Seriously, how did this make it past altoids testing? I don't know about the ""cherry"" but the ""apple"" is just plain awful. The gum tastes fine at first, then it's gets disturbingly, disgustingly sour. After about 5 minutes, all flavor is lost except for a flavor that I can only describe as burning rubber, and something you may find dead on the road, that's been sitting in the sun too long. At this point it will start to bother your teeth, making it almost painful to chew the gum. then about 5 minutes after that the gum will turn to powder, hiding itself away in every crevice of your mouth, and once you finally get all that mess out of your mouth, you're stuck with the rubber/dead animal flavor for 30 minutes to an hour.The story here is: Altoids did mints well, and sour hard candy very well, but gum? I don't think I can consider this gum, let alone edible."
4,"Good tire, very agressive","Very good tire, tough sidewalls and very agressive tread. The sidewalls seem lower profile than the tire of the same dimensions that I had previously, which I dont like, but even so it seems to hold up just fine. I got this tire after searching for the most reasonably priced agressive tire I could find, and this one fits the bill.I would buy this tire again."
5,Best Tires for XC,"These tires have kept a smile on my face since the day I installed them. I did not realize how terrible my other tires (and technique) were, until I rode on these. They grab everything and allow you to concentrate on pounding out mileage without the fear of losing traction. Ever ridden rails? Now you will.PROS:*AGGRESSIVE*STRONG*WTB*CHEAPCONS:*They eventually wear out."
3,"You don't get the ""Race"" tire","Even though you select ""folding race"" what you get is a ""folding comp"" tire. This tire is about 100 grams heavier each than the real ""race"" version of this tire. I wish somebody had posted that before i bought... It's still a good tire. It's just not the tire advertised."
1,This listing makes it look like you get both tires,"But it is only the rear tire. There's little indication until you add it to cart. beware!It would be great if you removed the photo of TWO tires and changed the headline to read ""TIRE"" and not ""TIRES"".It looks like a great tire and I know this is a reputable seller, but this listing should be revised! I have not installed it on my bike yet because now I have to order a front tire to match."
5,Thought-provoking,"I couldn't put this one down. It spoke to me - as a 44-year old mother of two and family physician, it was at once immensely engaging and deeply thought-provoking. The women's stories are well-told and extremely interesting. As a healthcare professional, I found the theory very clear, well-thought-out and helpful - both to me personally, and for many of my patients who are women between the ages of 40 and 60. We had a women's discussion group using this book as the jumping-off point, and it led us to some REALLY interesting discourse. It's a whole lot better than just thinking of this time of life as hot flashes and reading glasses!It really makes you think more actively about how to create the kind of life you want and what the developmental tasks are for women at midlife. Most highly recommended."
2,Good as a reference only.,"This book has, hands down, the worst explanations of any textbook I have ever read. During my second semester of calculus I just gave up reading the text and started relying solely on lecture. Also, half this book is fluff; such as the pointlessly short chapter on differential equations and all the chapters on applications(natural sciences, statistics etc.) Those things should be left to other books that can go into more detail. No course even has the time to cover all those topics. Important chapters, like methods for integration, are far too short(there is one stinking page for trigonometric substitution). The only redeeming factors of this book is that it has lots of color illustrations, and that it's massive enough to beat someone to death with."
3,Warning NO EXTRAs,"This is a very informative textbook and the college I'm studying at uses it for Calculus 1, 2 and 3, so it's not a bad deal.However, it does NOT come with the promised TEC CD-ROM, CD with interactive skill builder and iLrn. I complained and Amazon sent a 2nd new book but it didn't have the extras either. There was nothing more they could do. I went to the publishers site to buy them and could not find where to buy them, so I guess I'm out.Buyer beware - this is probably one to buy at your campus bookstore so you can see what you're getting."
3,Ordering Used Textbooks from Amazon,"I ordered the Calculus book from an online seller thru Amazon. The book was listed as new, and the title included the CD, Tutor, ect. When the book came it was new, but it did not include any of the digital materials. This is the second book from Amazon in the past week that this has happened. The Chemistry professor of the other book required the online access, so I had to immediately purchase a $45 package to access the materials. All in all, I could have the books new and complete from Amazon for about the same money as what I ended up spending. In the future, if I want the digital extras, I will contact the seller PRIOR to buying the item and confirm that they are indeed included. Not all sellers seem to feel this is worth mentioning when they are selling a new book that includes these extras in the title of the book."
5,Great!,"I purchased this CD to listen to a title song of a movie ""Knife In The Water"", but the opening one, Cul-De-Sac, was a bomb! Love the 60s theme."
1,this album doesnt pay legal rihts,"este album no paga derechos autoriales , es una produccion que se aprovecha del trabajo de años del grupo illapu ,por favor no compre este disco ,ya que ayuda al pirateo"
1,LOW QUALITY VERY EARLY RECORDINGS!!!,"THIS SHONGS ARE NOT THE GREATEST HITS OF THIS MANIFICENT GROUP! INSTEAD IS SOMETHING LIKE A LONG LOST HOME MADE RECORDING VERY BAD QUALITY. I ALLSO HAVE ""DE LIBERTAD Y AMOR"" FROM ILLAPU AND ITS A 100 TIMES BETTER QUALITY AND MUSIC."
5,Rare glimpse,"It is rare to see dancers at this high level submit to being filmed as they go through their daily exercises under the ballet master's tutelage. These exercises enable them to achieve the artistic mastery they display when executing the choreography of the classic ballet roles. As a student or balletomane, when you find yourself before such events, you must open your eyes and go to them not ask them to come to you. 40 minutes of pleasure."
1,Thank goodness it was only a buck...,"This was terrible. I tried to use it for a ballet workout and could barely follow the poor quality and the dancers, who were not following the routines accurately...nor did they stay together. The video cut in the middle of exercises to different angles, too. I couldn't get beyond the barre exercises before I had to turn it off in complete frustration. There are better ones available."
5,Beautiful Journal,"This really is a beautiful, classic looking journal. The pages are lined on both sides and there is an antique looking gold trim. The product, made in Italy, feels sturdy yet light in the hand. I was looking for a timeless book to write in and this is definitely it. The only issue I have with this is I am left-handed and the front face pops closed over my hand as I write, so I have to reach my right hand over to prop it open. This is annoying but I imagine this will stop happening as I break the spine in."
5,Get it!,"It's a very cool notebook. It's one of my favorite ones I've purchased so far. If you like collecting journals, this is a great one to add to your collection."
5,LOVERLY!,"I (along with help from from my dad's wallet) bought this journal so I can record the events of the day, and so I can finally have something to write my thoughts about my private bible studies in it.It's sooo pretty, with shiny, gold edged pages and it has sort of a soft, squishy cover (it's not bendable or flimsy at all, but I DID almost fall asleep on it).The shield pattern makes it look like it's sort of from the, well, the King Aurthur and the Knights Of the Round Table era which I love love love, and it gives me such an incentive to write (I have, in various places around the house, about ten, yucky, old, falling apart diary/journals or just a hunk o' paper to write on, in which I sadly, quickly lost interest).But anyways, I LOVE IT!**OO(())OO**If you got money to spend, :)BUY IT!!!"
4,"Looks nice, not quite as expected","I ordered this journal as a gift for my boyfriend. When it first arrived the package had been damaged and the leather was torn. I emailed the seller and they were incredibly friendly about replacing it for me right away. It is a nice journal, but just a note of caution: the indentations that appear grey in the photo are actually the same color as the rest of the leather, and the trimming around the edge is printed on gold paint. It also does not have the binding dents on the spine. It definitely is a nice journal, but not as old-timey looking as I had expected."
4,It's okay.,"It looks somewhat different from the picture. I thought it would be a more vibrant burgundy, but it turned out a little darker than expected. BUT! I love it. The gold makes it feel like vintage. I'm pretty satisfied for the price."
5,Yosemite hiking trails,"After visiting the Park earlier this year, I enjoyed looking again at the hiking trails. Some of the background commentary/music doesn't help; a little less human intrusion (and perhaps more birdsongs) would make it better for me."
3,BI-METAL?,"I HAVEN'T TRIED MINE YET, BUT NOWHERE ON THE BOX DOES IT SAY THESE ARE BI-METAL, JUST THAT THEY ARE HIGH SPEED STEEL WITH AN ALLOY BACKING. SOUNDS LIKE BI-METAL, BUT LOOKS LIKE REGULAR CARBON STEEL BLADES, WHICH BREAK EASILY."
5,Love Love Love,"Been drinking this for years. First thing in the morning, gives me a little pick me up. Not a coffee drinker. This is loaded with everything good for you.The flavor is explosive and the benfits are rewarding."
1,Buyer alert!!,$38 + shipping for a bottle of berry juice with UNPROVEN medicinal claims!!! Rip off!The unproven medicinal claims have been reported to the FDA.
5,Excellent! Helps both beginners and experienced,"Does not leave out essential information. Gives useful examples where needed. Though not a beginner to Unix, I was not very familiar with NIS and NFS. I was very pleased to find a Unix book that gave me all I wanted to know in an understandable format. This is not always the case with the O'reilly books."
2,Fairly Outdated,"This book is quite outdated. For example, it predates NFS version 3, NFS over TCP (mostly the default these days), or autofs.If you are a beginner and are looking for fundamental information this book might be useful if you remain aware of its shortcomings. It covers the fundamentals of NFS V2 over UDP, and NIS quite well, and has a good troubleshooting section, which might help beginners negotiate the interoperability and tuning issues that are common in today's multivendor environments. It covers automounting issues quite well, from an ""automount"" (SunOS 4) perspective."
2,Very Solaris centric,"I primarly use *BSD and was hoping to learn about NFS/NIS from this book, more than what I had already gleaned from the man pages. However this book is very heavily geared towards the Solaris OS. It does give exlamples of where the filename(s) or folder structures under a different flavor of Unix would be, but exept for these small tables, the rest of the text uses only the Solaris names/folders."
4,"Good CD, but not for everyone","This is not Brain Setzer Orchestra. It's not Cherry Poppin' Daddies. Those are the Good Sons of modern rockabilly. Hankenstein is the little brother that picked the wings off insects.I picked up my copy in a bargain bin, and have loved it since. It has an rockabilly/old school country feel to it but with a modern slasher film twist to it. Trust me, you'll be humming the chorus to Poor Lil Racoon for days to come: poor lil' raccoon, i think he's had it / now he's a nursery for ten thousand lil' maggots. It's catchier than it sounds.The only problem with it is that it is a niche CD, and you'll fid yourself taking it out to play for people rather than listening to it in your car. But hey, if you've read this far, go ahead and give it a while."
5,A True Aviator's Watch,"I owned several Seiko Flight Chronographs before I got my (first)Citizen Skyhawk. Years later Seiko still has few watches that display GMT/Zulu time. This is a must in Aviation. I just love my Skyhawks. I have them stainless steel, two-tone, and black. My black one is my favorite and it has really taken a beating. All the way to Iraq for a year with no problems at all. I crossed multiple time zones all over the Middle East and Europe and this watch kept me straight. Some countries don't do Daylight Savings (Kuwait) and others do (Iraq). The Skyhawk always got it right. Having a dedicated GMT display is key. My only complaint is that my Two-tone and black models have backlights, but my stainless does not. Why would Citizen leave that out on the Eco-drive models? Anyway, if you fly professionally, this is the watch to have."
3,"Beautiful, but hard to read",I bought this for my husband (a pilot) for Christmas to get him an upgrade on an older model Citizen. It is a beautiful watch and has all the bells and whistles it's supposed to but the font size for the time zone and charge indicator bars are a full size smaller than the older one and it's white on black as opposed to black on white the readout. It makes it very difficult to read unless you're directly under a light. Not much good if you're in the cockpit of a plane. I've since ordered the JR3125-55E. We'll see how that turns out.
5,Awesome watch!,"This watch is my favorite watch I own... I own a Tissot T-touch and I like this even more... I love that it has all of the time zones and they are quite easy to access. I live Switzerland, but all of my family is in the States. It's nice to have the analogue time set to the Swiss time, but have the digital display show Central time in the U.S. This is definitely my favorite feature... I highly recommend this watch..."
3,Not quite what I wanted - Citizen Eco-Drive Skyhawk,"I ordered this item thinking it was exactly what I wanted. But, when it arrived, I knew it wouldn't work for me. The numbers and dials were way too small for me to see. I sent it back for a refund."
1,"Unfortuneately ""no stars"" wasn't a choice, so it gets 1.","When I happened onto the Sci-Fi section of my local bookstore and saw a new ""Stainless Steel Rat"" title I couldn't wait to get it home and tear into it. That feeling soon wore off as I found that my beloved Jim DiGriz had been turned into a docile, wimpy version of his past self. Not only were the characters lacking their ususal spark and vibrance the story itself was completely BORING (it put me to sleep on numerous occasions) as it was totally unbelieveable compared to the excellence shown in past ""Rat"" books. Save yourself the heartache I've endured by seeing a great character go down the tubes and DON""T read this book."
2,What happened?,"I use to love the Rat. But I found this one so bad I couldn't recommend it to anyone. I started reading the Rat as a teenager, maybe I'm just too old for this stuff anymore."
1,Glad I found it at the Library,"I couldn't imagine spending money for this barrel of dung.This is the first Harry Harrison novel I've ever read. It will be the last. Is this typically how he writes? I've read hints that the Stainless Steel Rat novels are parodies of sci-fi pulp, which is fine. In that case, I got the joke. I got the joke five pages in; the rest was just extraneous. If it was a joke, it was spread awfully thin. A tattered plot filled with guys constantly ""growling menacingly"" and dames ""husking seductively"" (sorry, tossed it and am writing from memory)? Full of people otherwise otherwise engaging in all sorts of off-putting and utterly unverisimilitudinous behavior and speaking dialogue that would make Isaac Asimov blush? Sure, that might be funny in a short story. A whole novel full of it makes the reader feel cheated.Sorry, the Stainless Steel Rat Goes To Hell is less mature and thought-provoking than crud I used to write in elementary school."
3,Super Reader,"This is clearly the weakest Stainless Steel Rat Novel The Rat most of the time treats this investigation as an extended family holiday.He was really bored anyway on the stultifying planet of rich people getting rejuvenated.He has plenty of backup. ""As head of the Special Corps, the most secret of secret forces that defended the peace and protected the galaxy, his powers were awesome.""Jim is pretty confident in dealing with the alternature universe crossing, Hell creating, self-duplicating madman. ""One super-agent of superlative talent and experiment, a lone wolf, he who slinks by night, lithe, hand-some, unbeatable--the galaxy's best agent."""
3,Stainless Steel Rat Goes Downhill,"Slippery Jim, with wife and sons, is back saving the universe again. It starts with an apparent scam, a store-front preacher promising heaven to anyone who can pay enough. The funny thing is, he seems to be delivering on his promise, and not in the form of a one-way trip.The ins an outs from universe to universe are amusing, as are some of the side-comments. (""Atomic bomb. Keep out of reach of children."") Some scenes would work well in animation, like two hundred Marines storming the gates of Hell, armed with salami. The plot is largely driven by magical saves, though, relying the superscientist on the good guys' team to whip up a hyper-interdimensional-thingie after a few minutes of rewriting the fundamental laws of the universe. It's entertaining enough, but the freshness is definitely off the series.//wiredweird"
1,The tanking of the series,"This book is what I consider the terminal end to the series. I've been a die-hard fan of Slippery Jim for around... two decades (and I'm only 26). This book, however, is a phenominal whiffle of bunk. I can't believe that the series has become this corny. It's terribly insulting that Mr. Harrison would do this to one of my most beloved literary memories. Not that I want to give away any spoilers, but I have one word for those of us that have already read the book... SAUSAGES!So lets say that you don't believe me. Just have a look at the cover. That pretty much sums up the feel of this book. Corny. It made me irate for days.I'd still like to recommend the first 7-8 books in the series to you folks, though."
1,James diGriz goes to Hell and should remain,"I was very disappointed by the previous SSR book - The Stainless Steel Rat Sings the Blues - but I was hoping that it was a sad lapse by a writer that I have otherwise enjoyed consistently. I was wrong. Very wrong. This book reads like a parody of his previous books. The humor is forced, the characters are flat, the plot is ludicrous (and manages the neat trick of being both rushed and tedious at the same time), and incredibly useful (and incoherent) devices are invented at the drop of a hat whenever the main characters need them.I earnestly hope that Harry Harrison doesn't write another SSR book because if he writes one I'll buy it and read it and I'm pretty sure after the last two that I won't like it."
2,Dissapointed...,"I always found the Stainless Steel Rat series engaging and entertaining. Unfortunately this novel does not meet my expectations. Its plot seems to wander from one stupid thing to the next - totally ruining the scene. Jim DiGriz seems to be totally out of character and has lost his wit. This novel bares an unfortunate resemblance to the terrible ""Bill the Galactic Hero"". I hope the next novel doesn't lack the chaotic wit the others did. Well, I've said my piece."
4,Read it for the Poems,"As spare as they are, most of Carver's short stories strike me as a bit long-winded. Not so his poetry, which treats his usual themes--alcoholism, working-class poverty, and rocky relationships--with greater wit and vigor than his prose. The essays will be of interest to would-be writers and Carver biographers, but what makes this book outstanding is the 60 pages of poetry which comprise its heart."
2,Boring book,I didn't care for this novel. This was the first book I read by Stella Cameron and it will probably be the last. I just found it annoying because there were so many characters referenced in this book like I was supposed to know who they were and also care. I have a feeling that there are a series of books involving these other characters. I just found this book predictable and the dialog annoying. I know this book takes place in New Orleans/Louisiana but it was laborious to read all the same.
2,Disappointing conclusion...,"I'm new to Stella Cameron's books. However, in this series I really enjoyed the first 2 books and was very excited about Sykes' story coming out. What a disappointment! This book was awful. The dialogue didn't even flow correctly and the whole story seemed rushed. I spent more time re-reading passages to make sure I had read it right and was very unhappy with the grammical mistakes. Who editted this book? They need to go back and take a basic English course!Sykes and Poppy, the main characters, weren't fully developed and their story just seemed to be thrown together. The story left more questions than answers. I'll re-read the first 2 books in this series but I'm not sure about this one.This was a real disappointment and I'm sad to say that the conclusion to this triology really didn't make much sense. It's not worth the time it took to read it. Sorry Ms. Cameron, I really, really enjoyed the first 2 books in this series. What happened with this one?"
2,A Grave Mistake,"Guy Gautreaux, an NOPD cop on a leave of absence finds himself in the middle of more than one investigation rather than resting on his time off. A dead body turns up in a Toussaint, La. bakery, one that happens to be owned by Jilly Gable, a friend of Guy's. Is this murder in any way tied to the fact that Jilly's long lost mother has suddenly appeared in her life, bringing along a new step father, neither of which Guy thinks is worth trusting as far as Jilly could throw them?There's nothing really new or surprising here. You have old friends finding love and passion, evil interlopers, murder, and a handful of colorful characters to jazz things up a bit. The true creepiness is like unto reading stories set in New York following 9-11; you know things have changed radically in that part of the country and may never be the way the book portrays them again.Amanda Killgore"
3,Loved the New Orleans Flavor!!,Just finished reading this book and thoroughly enjoyed. It took me back to my visits in New Orleans making both the characters and the scenery Ms. Cameron describes very real! The steam between Guy and Jilly was sexy red hot.A Good read!
1,Terrible,"This book is terrible! Boring, repetitive, some of the characters were just not believeable. This book is not worth trying to wade through. I finished it but it took great effort. I have read a lot of Ms. Cameron's books but this will be the last."
4,Eh....Cry of the Icemark was better,"It was okay. The book was still good, but I found myself often wanting to skip boring pages describing the land, culture, and whatnot about the Southern Continent. For the longest time it seemed like things were at a standstill for chapters on end. However, Oskan's veiws were great, and it was nice to see Thirrin again. Still, it annoyed me how like EVERY character seemed to be against a certain evil character. It seemed like Oskan cared, and Thirrin was completely oblivious."
4,Has its problems but great overall,"This is one of the best high-fantasy series I've come across so far. I finished reading this book several days ago and thought it really good. It's involving, thorough and overall, it's great! My only problems are Medea's pigheadedness and how she's really unreasonable in her thinking (but Stuart Hill may just be commenting on the average teenage mind) and how the Icemark's new allies are essentially copies of ancient African and Middle-East Kingdoms. A little more creativity, *please*.....This book is still worth a read, though. Odds are, you probably won't be disappointed."
1,Nope a notta,"I didnt even get through the first chapter! I don't like that Thirrin was not the protagonist. THe total character change caused me to be angy at the author. I'd much rather like to read another story about Thirrin. Not her children. But i have to addmit, the Blade of fire's protagonist is different then most."
4,"Good foundation, slow plot","I really enjoyed reading 'Cry of the Icemark' so I was excited to see was Mr. Hill had thought of next. The formula was good, with Thirrin, Oskan and her kids, but the story was dragged out far too long and ended to abruptly. Overall a good book, if it had been shortened a bit."
1,Very inadequate,"This book is small, hard to read and poorly laid out. The version I bought did not come with the CD! It is a $10 book - for that price it would be fine but I paid $40.Look around for a better product."
4,love your spunk.,"april 19, 1999. From Kenosha, Wi.. HEY....Let's here some more from you guys! It's different. Maybe a little more God in your songs. You have alot of talent."
4,This album is a good example of a young band doing Gods will,This CD is awsome except for the few slow songs in it. Chem6A is one of the most original coolest songs I have ever heard. They are three cool kids on a mission for God.
3,Switchfoot Fans Only,"Don't get me wrong, Switchfoot is one of my favorite bands if not my favorite, but I don't really like this CD as much as some of their other ones. The lyrics are strange and suicidal in a way, and the messages are hard to decipher. Some songs are one of my favorites from Switchfoot, such as Chem 6a and Underwater, but overall, the CD cannot compare to the likes of their other albums. If you are new to Switchfoot, I would recommend New Way to Be Human to begin with. But if you are a hardcore fan, I would definatly pick this one up."
5,San Diego Rock Band,"This was the album that started it all. From ""Chem6A"" to ""Home"" to ""Life and Love and Why"" this song will keep you rocking. This is truly a great CD. I listen to it regularly even though it came out, what 4.5 years ago...this is the album to get along with their other two. You will not be dissapointed.Look for their NEW album FEB 25 from Columbia RecordsIt's gonna be even better than the others!"
1,Don't Waste time/money,I got this sewing machine at Target thinking that it would be nice to have a small sewing machine as I live in the dorms. I thought that I would not need to bring my bulky sewing machine to school. I tried using it and I just gave up. I've sewn quite a lot and this was just terrible. Firstly It would not work by the outlet plug and I had to try batteries. Then It kept jamming itself and turning off. All in all this machine is a joke - don't waste your money.
1,Not even as good as a toy,"I have a nice Euro-Pro sewing machine that I love, so I thought this one would be perfect as a stand-in while mine is being tuned up. I only wanted it for simple stitching as I save the big stuff for my other machine. I was very disappointed. This machine is very cheaply made, it feels and sews like a toy. Though I'm not a professional seamstress, I do know how to sew but I couldn't get this machine to sew more than a few stitches without jamming up. Luckily, I bought my daughter a Mini-Rex, which was cheaper and works loads better. This one went right back to the store, it's a definite ""NO""."
1,Shark is short-lived!,"I received this machine as a birthday present. The first night I tried it, the power and light would turn on and off at random intervals until I could not turn it back on. I returned it to Target where I was given half of the machine's retail price because I did not have a receipt! (Did I mention this was a gift?) I purchased a Singer 8280 and I am very excited about it. Don't waste your time or money on this machine, the frustration is not worth it!"
1,no parts supply,"The main body of the machine is ok. But the split tip of the plastic large spool pin broke after a couple of use. There is only one in the package. I tried to glue it but it didn't hold. I searched for it on the internet. No luck and saw other users have the same problem and looking for the same part. Then, I call the customer service number on the manual (they don't have a web site. can you believe it!). They told me no one else carry their parts because they are the manufacturer, and they don't have the spool pin becuase this machine is so small. I tried to give feedback and they hang up on me. So, although the machine body is still good, it's useless without the spool pin."
1,Piece of Junk,"I was excited to get a small sewing machine for college, for small projects like totes or hemming lounge pants. This machine was a disappointment and total waste of my $10 at Target. It jams up every few stitches, comes with poor instructions, and it's extremely loud. Sounds like an annoying leaf blower, surprising considering its size. I constantly adjusted the tension and spool; it seemed like the small plastic pieces were either broken or will break any moment. Perhaps I had a defective product, but even so, something that initially worked fine shouldn't fall apart within minutes of use. If it were free, you're better off donating it than letting this waste your space."
1,bad buy,"I've never sewn before and thought i would buy this cheap machine to hem pants and to do simple projects but it failed almost immediately.Cons:1. it didn't sew through one layer of denim or two layers of thin material.2. the thread kept coming knotted or slipped out of the needle3. once it started sewing, it was very hard to control speed and accuracy.4. it took 30 minutes to sew one hem before i quit using it.Pros:1. it came with all the accessories (needles, thread, pins) that I could use to hand sew projects since the machine didn't work."
4,A really good mystery,"This book kept me on the edge of my seat wondering who was really the evil one. At times it was one sister, then she had you thinking it was the other one! Superb! Loved it!"
2,good just good,The Good Sister by Diana Diamond the whole story is based on a very familiar theme of their being a bad sister and a good sister and can the reader guess which one is which? The execution of this theme isn't done any differently in this novel than if you were watching a lifetime movie. The suspense is pretty good it kept me guessing nearly until the end. It's good for lite reading.
3,Not all that Thrilling,"I must admit, I have become a fan of Diana Diamond and I was looking forward to this novel. Unfortunately it was definitely not her best work. There was no real twist. It was pretty obvious who the bad sister really was. I kept hoping for some dynamic twist, but I was sorely disappointed.besides that issue, I found myself slightly irritated with the characters. Some of the dialogue seemed downright silly and seemed to serve as filler. Like many other reviewers I found myself disliking most if not all of the characters. They were weak to say the least and to borrow a word from another reviewer, they were wooden. If you just want a quick read to kill time, then grab this book. If you are looking for a more involved thriller, look elsewhere."
2,Doesn't live up to my expectations,"I thought this novel has lots of potential when I read the back of the novel. However, once I start reading it; it gets harder and harder to continue. For one thing, I don't find any of the characters likeable. I somehow find them lack of emotions and mechanical. For another thing, I just don't like the writing style. It's like reciting the events rather than really have them laying out to the reader's eyes. There are very few dialogues and not enough descriptions for me to picture what's going on in the story. At the end, I have to skip pages to get to the end and just finish with it."
2,"Eh, not one of the best Kelly has ever picked","This is the story of two sisters - Jennifer and Catherine Pegan. One is good and one is bad. Actually they are both neurotic if you ask me.I grabbed this one becasue the other two books that I read from Reading with Ripa were great. This one was marginal at best. If it is between reading this and the zoning codes of your area, I would at least give the codes a chance."
3,You can guess who is the BAD ONE,"This book wasn't bad but it was not as suspenseful as the cover and excerpt in the back led me to believe. Once you start reading the book which is about two sisters who own a billion dollar company and hate each other you can pretty much guess whose the good and whose the bad. Even though the author does a good job in letting you inside the head of the wacko sister, you feel letdown because there really aren't that many twist and turns to keep you guessing. Overall the book wasn't bad but by no means was it the page turner I expected it to be."
2,The Good Sister,"I bought this book because I have been reading all the books recommended by Kelly Ripa. I was very disappointed by the book. I didn't think it was an easy read. The book is broken up into parts. The first part was so technical and in so much detail that it did not keep my interest . Once the book reaches the third part (about 177 pages into the book) the story is really moving. Personally, I prefer a book that moves from the first page to the last page. I did not find it very romantic and I was actually able to figured out who done it about half way through. I have never been able to do that before."
2,Not very good,"I really enjoy other Diana Diamond books I have read, so I was pretty bummed after I started this.For the first half of the book I kept going back and forth as to who the 'bad' sister was, but by the time it was revealed I didn't care anymore.I actually did not like either sister. I found them both weak, and boring."
1,SKIP THIS ONE!,"To say this is atrocious drivel is to pay it a compliment. Skip this book and save your money AND your time. Learn from MY mistake and pass this one up.Jennifer, the biz whiz and her actress sister Catherine have been rivals their entire lives. They are a year apart and despite the lavish gifts they received since childhood, there is that underlying resentment and rivalry.Jennifer marries this revolting excuse of a man named Padraig O'Connell. He has no saving grace. Natrually Catherine gets into the mix and the marriage goes bust. That was ONE favor Catherine granted Jennifer!Towards the end of the book, there is a battle to the death (and yeah, we do have a casualty here, folks) and the lackluster ending does nothing to enhance the book. There was not one single likable character in this atrocious book. There are no surprises, no shocks, no saving graces to be found. This book is a complete waste.I would not wish this book on anyone. This book belongs in the toilet."
2,Disappointing,"I am a big fan of Ms. Feehan's Dark Series, but lately I wonder what has happened to her writing. This book looked promising but was sadly disappointing. This one is not a keeper."
3,O.K.,This book was okay. Not bad but not great either. Some situations seem greatly exagerated in trying to hard for the story to work. Lily is always in heat. And Ryland well nicolas seemed more intriging.
4,Nice change of pace!,"I have to admit that I was getting a little bored by the Dark series (sorry, I loved them in the beginning, but they are starting to sound an awful lot alike) and I wasn't sure about the concept of this new book. I am SO glad I gave it a try. All the fun of the Dark series with a new twist, sizzling sex, and a slew of great men for future books. I'm hooked!"
3,Ghostwalkers vs storyline,"I found that this book was not as good as her other books dealing with the vampires. Her story was extremely slow in some areas and very hard for me to continue reading. I have read her other books and this I feel is just not up to her other efforts. I would read this if I had no other books to read, but I would skip some of the story. It is good, but not a great read."
3,Cheesy but ok,"This book was not what I expected. I thought it would be deeper, more of a psych thriller. It is 75% romance! It's cheesy romance, too, but that's expected; most romance/sex novels are. The plot is creative and has serious potential for a great series. However in order to do that, she needs to take out most of the sex scenes and a lot of the romantic connection. I bought book 2 also, so after I read that one maybe I'll change my mind."
4,Great book,I have been reading the Dark Series of Christine's. I enjoyed this book almost as much as I enjoy the others. I suggest this book for a good read.
3,"Hmmm... good plot, too much thinking going on...","This is kind of a hard review to write. I'll have to say that I really liked the idea for the new series... the storyline was great, I really enjoyed the action, the suspense, ALL the men in the team, the secondary characters in Lily's family, Ryland & Lily - & their romance... However, it went on and on and on and on about what they were thinking & feeling about each other. That gets so old - so fast. I did major skimming to get through what they thought & felt about each other... in fact, it was almost hard to finish the book. I do want to try CF's next installment of the series, but I surely hope it doesn't have this much thinking in it! (p.s. If you want to get into the new series, I think this book will be a must.)"
2,"Read other ""Game"" books first","I have found when reading a series of books that often I like the middle books much better than the very first one of the series. For that reason, I purposely avoided reading this book first and chose Deadly Game hoping for the author's more confident voice further into the series. I really enjoyed Deadly Game and pushed forward to this book. Wow, what a difference. This book felt like it plodded along. I really did not have a strong affinity for either of the main characters and was relieved when it was finally done. I will continue reading this series because I know the series gets better. I think you could completely skip this one and go on to still read the series and not miss much of anything."
2,Not Up to Her Usual,"I read the second book in this series first, so thought I should go back and read this one for background. I am a Feehan fan, and have enjoyed her Dark series. I like the premise for this series, but she could have done so much more with the plot. It reads as if half the story was cut out to make room for the endless sex. I like good erotica as much as the next person, but after about the third time I just skipped over the steamy parts and looked for some story. Other reviewers have complained about Christine's repetition of phrases. Let me add ""bare bottom"" to the list. This was disappointing. Mind Game is better, and I am hoping the next book in the series improves even more."
2,major disappointment,"I am such a big fan of Christine Feehan. Discovered her early and wait impatiently for each new book. I think her Dark series is sexy,taut,different and totally consuming. I enjoyed The Scarletti Curse almost as much. However, Lair of the Lion and now Shadow Game almost seem like they were written by somebody else.Again, this was a major disappointment!"
1,OMG I could not force myself to finish,I hated the first half of this book and really tried to keep going. She repeats herself a lot in this book. I just found it kinda stupid!
4,Whats with the bad revews?,"Like all the other Feehan fans, I love the Carpathian series. I thought this was a good first book for a new series. ""New"" being the key word. Some people read this thinking it would be like those books, and disappointed because its not. Well, its not. The book is a good beginning book. It has a good story line, hot like Feehans books are and it gives you a good idea of how the series is going to go on. Its got its suspense and then was so funny I was laughing out loud. Its an opener, a good one. Lily is a sweetheart and Ryland is a good man. I love the rest of the team and will keep reading this series. I have read the second book too, Mind Game and thought it was a good continuation of the Ghostwalker story and loved Nicolas and Dahlia. The series is promising and good. But not like the Carpathian books. They are addicting in their own way."
3,How many times can people screw in a book?,"Overall, I thought the book was okay. The plot was actually very believable, and I think many people would have liked it better if Feehan had done two things: 1) Focus more on the plot and on the characters; 2)Reconsider how many romance scenes there needs to be in one book.Seriously, the romance scenes (albeit pretty good and 'creative') sort of killed it."
2,A Little Boring--2 1/2 Stars,"I've read ALL of Feehan's books and have reread many of them because I loved them so much. This story, however, was boring. I found myself skipping paragraphs then skipping pages. There were a lot of repetitive conversations and thoughts. Both Lily and Ryland thought the same things over and over. Also, although I find this shocking (coming from me) the sex scenes WERE redundant. It just got to be enough already. I really found it hard to believe that after Lily was punched in the face and slapped around and dragged by her hair, she would want to have sex that very same evening with Ryland. That's really stretching it.It was not as well written as her other stories. It's definitely not a re-read for me."
4,What can I say except....Wow! Hot!,"All I can say is this book is smoking hot! It's one of my CF favorites......couldn't put the book down till the last page. Characters are believable and lovable. I definately recommend all CF's books (Dark Symphany, etc....) there are other characters, such as Nicolas Travane (one of the men that the heroin recuse), who will hopefully get his own book.I am looking forward to getting my hands on her new book ""Wild Rain""."
2,How sad....,"I LOVE Feehan books. I am constantly rereading the ""Dark"" books. I even order the Large Print to get them in hard back. HOWEVER, this ""Shadow"" book was at best a shadow of the ""Dark"" books, a faint shadow at that. A PAINFULLY BORING READ. I COULD BARELY GET THROUGH IT. For the first time ever in a Feehan book, I had to fast read (skimming over stuff) to get to the end. Oh Christine, tell me you're not succumbing to publisher pressure to ""get the book out"". So here's a 2 rating because you're Feehan."
4,I liked it!,"I really liked this book. I didn't think I would, but I found myself glued to it. I wish there had been more, but I guess she had to end the book somewhere. I am hopeful she will pick it up and write more about the other characters in it."
2,Super Reader,"While this is considerably better than that Dark rubbish, a large part of it is still eye-rolling cornball with not a lot happening except for the two main characters having the telepathic horn for each other and shagging a lot.A professor disappears, and his daughter is brought into the picture of his psionic research project. He had been making psychic soldiers, basically. Telepaths, telekinetics, dreamtalkers.It is discovered that she was also part of this project as they had been scouring the globe for talent."
1,Do not waste your time or money....,"The story was a great idea, but the dialogwas atrocious. Ms. Feehan should have paid me to read this sophomoric piece of work. Please don't waste the use of your eyes."
2,"Five Stars??? Well, I don't know about that.","Found the book useful as a starting point. Complete, thorough. Interesting tidbits. But when it came down to actually scheduling trips and tickets, I found out that most of the information was already out of date.BahamasAir wasn't familiar with the AirPass, so I had to fax them the section where the author cattily railed on them. All they had to say was ""interesting.""The suggested weekend and week trips were a little sketchy as well. In fact, when I had acutally arrived, I never used the book because of the terrific tourist infrastructure already in place.Overall, I felt the author was a little harsh on his take with Bahamian culture, keeping a good sense of humor but almost crossing the line of offensive in some places.People should remember that these tour books are a subjective peephole into their place of destination, and should always keep an open mind to discover for themselves.I had a great time there."
1,season three Wanted Dead or Alive,"Only half of the episods of season three were sent. The box clearly shows all the episods of season three that I did not receive. I need a refund, as I was cheated!"
5,Great Show! Quality Acting,"I pretty much thought this show would be another cheesy western tv series filmed in the late 50s, but I wanted to see it anyway because I love Steve McQueen (the King of Cool). I was SHOCKED to see such high caliber action scenes and acting. The story lines are great. The show will have you on the edge of your seat wondering ""how will our hero make it out of this jam."" Although they recycle the same characters over and over, it is worth the watch, each episode. I bought season 1 first, then could not wait to see season 2 and 3. I see now why Steve McQueen was so popular. He makes acting look so easy!"
5,wanted dead or alive,Great tv western. Steve McQueen starred in this series and gave him a chance to become a major star.
5,Excellent:,We now own all three seasons of Wanted: Dead or Alive starring Steve McQueen. If you like this actor then you will definately like these shows. You have to see them to appreciate the black and white westerns. A must have if you're a fan. Enjoy....
4,"Cute height chart, but no cm","This is a very cute height chart made of solid wood. Looks very durable. Comes with two movable height markers. As the other reviewer pointed out: there are no cm measurements, only inches. Even though the picture on the box shows both inches and cm, and the description also mentions both. We plan to add cm measurements by attaching a measurement tape."
5,Another Great Molly Hatchet Live Album,"GREATEST HITS LIVE by Molly Hatchet was recorded at a Lincoln's Birthday Show at the Palladium in Los Angeles in 1982, and it's absolutely great! Lead singer Jimmy Farrar is terrific, and the rest of the band, especially guitarists Dave Hlubek, Duane Roland, and Steve Holland, really kicks hard. Overall, the music sounds like a blend of Foghat and the Outlaws, and is a must-own for anyone interested in tail-kicking southern-fried rock."
3,Too thin,"These bags are as advertised but I failed to note (it's not obvious) how thin they are. They are too thin for all but the lightest of loads, say leaves that have not been mulched and without any twigs. Otherwise, they easily tear."
4,Good Quality,These were good quality. They are little thin and will get holes in the them when you are using them. It didn't seem to make a big difference as none of the bags came totally apart.
1,Unbelief is damnation for those who don't bend knee and say Jesus is Lord!,This book is about a women who hates the God of the Bible and is heading for Hell according to God's Holy Scripture. Don't buy it or read it. It is from the pit of hell.
1,First time broke,"I got it fast, put in my 3 yrs old grandaughter, played in the pool for about two hours, went to lunch, took a nap, at three pm, tried to zip the zipper with no luck, (the begining of it, at the bottom, would not slide one into the other) had to returned to Amazon. Got one star due to the fast RMS service at Amazon."
1,Didn't work for us,"Child tips forward (face first) in the water. Tried it with lots of kids who've come around -all 2-3 yes old. Might be better for older kids. We use the puddle jumper instead, love it."
1,Scared us to death,"My son is 2, 25 lbs, wore a small that was too tight. We took out 2 of the floating devices, btw they are just foam bars. They are meant to be removed as your child grows so we were using it properly. He jumped off the first step and sunk. We didn't wait to see if he would float back up. One mishap was enough to return it. Amazon was great about the return. Fast, easy and efficient."
5,As Advertised,This jacket has made my toddler comfortable moving around the swimming pool on his own. He has gone from clinging to my hands or the side of the pool to insisting to be left to paddle around the pool himself.Thanks.
5,Best Life Jacket EVER!!!,"by far the best life jacket out there. It is non constricting on my son, it's like having a wet suit on, not an astronaut suit on. i had a problem with the original one i received and their customer service sent a new one to me in 2 days, great company!"
1,This is Wendt's worst...,"I've no idea what Wendt was thinking when he wrote this, but this doesn't even begin to measure up to his previous best works. This doesn't have a Samoan setting, and he's first and foremost a regional writer, so it's painful to read this mishmash of a novel. Couldn't help thinking about ""Flying Fox"" and ""Sons for the Return Home"" and wishing that Wendt had stuck to what he knows best: Samoa and its people."
5,"Award-winning, great for travellers and rail buffs","LENGTH: 30 Minutes You'll travel deep into some of the most remote areas of Missouri and Arkansas... areas that are accessible only by rail. As you ride along you will venture through long tunnels and over high bridges that were built nearly 100 years ago! You will also experiance the sights and sounds of Branson, the 'Live Entertainment Chapital of North America'. If you've been to Branson you'll want this as a remembrance, if you're planning a trip, watch this first!"
1,Design Errors,"Form Setup does not work in Peachtree Complete Accounting 7.0. Peachtree makes it easy to choose the data you would like to appear on your forms, however, under many criteria categories either no data or incorrect data is pulled. I chose ""description for sales"" and it worked for a while but then started drawing from ""description for purchases"" (tech support was able to duplicate this). When I asked for ""short description"" I got ""description for purchases"", ""description for sales"", ""short description"", or nothing at all depending on the form I was printing. Peachtree told me it is a design problem that was present in 6.0 and will be present in the next version, 8.0. Bernard from tech support told me that the following version may work properly but that he was ""not at liberty to discuss"" when that might be. I am returning my software because Peachtree seems in no hurry to fix design problems."
1,Not for Your Average Joe,Too complicated for people without accounting backgrounds! Several steps to perform a single task. Do NOT recommend if you want a simple way to manage your business.
4,Great for accountants,"The most feature-rich product in its price range, but it has asteep learning curve..."
4,Cool Indie Film,"Karl Hirsch's film 'Green' is a wonderfully true to life tale of four pals in Phoenix during a night in which each has their own ""adventure"". The writing and directing is especially strong for a low budget independent film, and the animated sequence is definitely not to be missed. Despite its showing at and winning numerous film festivals, I'm still wondering why this film was so overlooked. Overall, a very telling film for anyone currently aged 25 to 30, especially if you haven't quite gotten things going yet... like me."
4,Great value,"Dawn dishwashing foam is my favorite dish washing detergent. But when the shipment arrives, two bottles have leak. I hope they have better packaging."
1,A total waste,"First time out, trying to strip old paint from a retaining wall, center spins free from the pad. Was using it for what it was intended and it doesn't last as long as the first resin abrasive disc."
1,Super 3d animations?,"This product has ""super 3d animations"". It says so on the box... and they do include cardboard 3d glasses. If you remember the ""3d"" movies requiring these, I need say no more. This animation did not work well on film, the limited resolution provided by a computer monitor is even less suited to it.I could have overlooked this flaw, but the content is insufficient as well. There are 9 subjects covered by the title, ranging from pre-algebra through calculus, yet there is only one CD. This allows for only a brief overview of each subject (including ""super 3d animations"") - this might be fine for review, but does not justify the claim ""ultimate mathematics skill building resource"" printed on the box.All in all, I would recommend against wasting your time with this one."
1,"PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, OR FROM THIS COMPANY",I could not believe the quality of this product. It IS trash. the ad was an out right lie. I am astonished that Amazon would be affiliated with such a farce. The return policy is a joke. I will be reporting the company the to BBB. Please do not but this product. This company must know some of it products are crap or they would not charge a restocking fee 20% and return fee 10%! what a joke.
1,My mp4 crashed,"I'm sad my mp4 crashed i don't know why, on Sunday I used the sound was excelent i liked it. Yesterday night i wanted use but said ""disk error"" the hard disk said C:00mb. What happened? I bought 2 months ago"
3,review of mp4 mp3 player,I purchased this item for christmas and have had trouble with it. I have been unable to use the adapter that came with it to charge it and also when it was received it was not in a box it looked as if someone had already used it.I am not pleased with it at all. I will never purchase from the compnay that supplied this item again.
4,A Good Item for the Price,"When I first received this Item I had a lot of problems with it, the CD Rom disk was corrupted, the USB cord was defective, and the AC Charger was broken. When I contacted the seller about it he replied to me very quickly, and he was very helpful about replacing the defective equipment. He was also very helpful when the second USB cord didn't work either, and offered to replace the cord yet again without any hassles. Now that I've learned how to use the MP3 player and I've been helped so eagerly by the seller and customer service, I love my MP3! The item is great for the money that I spent, and i'm extremely pleased with the sellers cooperation with me."
1,Does not player DRM content,battery is not rechargable. Doesn't work at all. Sold by Blueproton and they have a return policy that sucks. When you go to a store to return an item they do not charge a 20 percent restocking fee and 10 percent fee if you cancel item they also only have a 21 day return policy and certain items they wont even consider returning. would not recommend item or merchant. BE AWARE IF SEEMS TO GOOD TO BE TRUE IT IS......
1,Skip this one and save yourself the tylenol!,"I'm an experienced programmer who wanted to learn java and MS J++ 6.0. I made it half way through the first chapter when I gave up and decided to return the book. I'm sorry, if an author cannot get a hello world example correct as well as basic screen descriptions, it's not worth trying to figure it out. It seems obvious to me that the author has not tried his own exmples. It's as if he wasn't familiar with the subject matter prior to writing the book."
2,Strange book,J++ from the ground up is clearly false advertising. If you're a beginner in Java you should not use this book. I tried to do this but had to resort to another book. Now I try once more to get through this book. Sometimes this book is excellent but sad to say most of the time it is annoying. In some chapters the author is only repeating a lot of methods in a boring way. There are few code examples and many doesn't work. And finally I want to say that I think that the polluted Java this book represents should be prohibited and sent to hell.
3,I found this book in book store selling for nothing,"I picked it up to rid the world of yet another failed attempt of Microsoft for world domination. Note that the only reason Netscape released Netscape's source code is to prevent Microsoft from perverting the HTTP protocol and web standards that Netscape had researched and put in place. J++ was Microsoft's attempt to pervert Java. This has been Microsoft gut reaction to new technologies when they come on the market. I got this book partially to keep my door closed. I've thought how it would smell in the fireplace too.It's probably a pretty good read but I got it merely for the humor of finding a book on the now mostly (??) defunct J++.. Never implement with Microsoft languages, I'll tell you now, you can learn the lesson later."
1,Not for Everyone Wanting to Learn J++,"I got this book based upon the other glowing recommendations. I was VERY disappointed. This book is as dry as a text book. It jumps quickly from subject to subject. And you hardly ever code with this book! What ever happened to the idea of learning by doing? Perhaps you need to be experienced to like this book. Okay, but the cover says, ""Begin as a novice..."". Finally, there is no CD with the book - you have to go on-line to see examples. In general, this book is NOT the right book for EVERYONE, especially those new to J++."
1,Not a good book for a Java beginner,"The title for this book indicates that is for a Java beginner. The Amazon.com editorial indicates the same thing. I found this book confusing and did not provide a good basis for learning Java. Maybe this book would be good for someone who knows Java and wants to learn Microsoft's VM and J++. After having read this book completely, I have purchased another beginner book and am starting over with much more success."
1,Unclear explanations with examples that don't work,"I'm a very experienced programmer (though not in VJ++) who found this book to be very difficult to use. I had to read some of the explanations three or four times to get at the meaning -- and that was in Chapter 2! Also, some examples were clearly wrong. Do yourself a favor: read Chapters 1 and 2 in the bookstore before you buy the book. You may be able to save yourself the trouble of returning it (which is what I did.)"
1,Not very good,"This book tout's itself as ""Open This Book as a Novice and finish It as a Pro"". This is a VERY incorrect self-assesment. As a novice, I found that the sample code in the book was just plain wrong. The book may be okay for someone with J++ experience but it certainly isn't written with the beginner in mind. Osborne did a disservice by giving this book the title ""from the Ground Up"". It probably would have been better titled ""starting from the middle""."
4,Not for the Beginner,This is NOT the book you need if your just beginning your journey into the world of programming. This book covers the basics quickly and moves on to advanced topics like the WFC and COM/DCOM. However if you are experienced in C++ get this book it will get you started very quickly into the world of Java
1,One to miss,"I bought this book having no previous Java knowledge or experience, and have to admit that I found it to be of a poor standard. Maso moves too quickly between topics, leaving some necessary information to be poorly documented, or left out completely. In order to fully comprehend some of Maso's explanations, I actually ended up having to buy another book.The most annoying point that can be made regarding ""Visual J++ From The Ground Up"", however, is that many (if not even most) of the code listings are actually incorrect. Whilst the downloadable code seems to compile properly, the methods detailed in the book itself have many errors.This book is one to miss."
2,"Good Early 30's Movies, But Not Really ""Forbidden""","This set should have been sold as a Bill Wellman (the director of all 6 movies) box set, not as Forbidden Hollywood. These are entertaining movies, but most didn't have the things I look for in a ""dirty 30's"" movie - a sassy, tough leading lady, night clubs, gangsters, alcohol, crime and taboo relationships... It just seemed like TCM was stretching it - billing all of these movies as forbidden. For their next collection I'd like to see ""Ladies They Talk About"", ""Call Her Savage"" and ""Illicit"". More tough dames, less working-class men!"
3,OK for oldies,"Not outstanding movies, but entertaining for any one who enjoys the old black & white pics from the early days."
3,"Not as ""forbidden"" as other collections.","TCM was running some of the movies from this collection one night not long ago, and I was disappointed. Heroes for Sale, to me, did not fit in a ""forbidden"" collection like others obviously did; The Purchase Price was another one that really didn't fit and I love Barbara Stanwyck's early movies. In the other collections, racy ones like ""The Divorcee"" with Norma Shearer, limits were pushed and kept you interested. This collection will not be one I buy. I will buy, instead, the new one ""Pre-Code Hollywood."""
2,So far 1 disc when I should have 3,"I ordered this BOX SET hoping to get all 3 CDs, but so far I've gotten 1 CD and it wasn't even in the right CD holder, so I'm thinking that either the other 2 discs are on the way or that I'm stuck with only 1 CD rather than having all 3. Where are the other 2 CDs?"
4,Not bad....,"But it is actually a compliation CD, so the consistency in Digital sound is SO not there. But it was an older CD of John singing some of his favs, so it was well worth it."
5,John Barrowman is wonderful!!!!,John has such an amazing singing voice. Which will have you listening to the cd over and over again.
1,"Learn how to act, then learn how to sing....","Wow. Rediculous. John needs to learn how to interpret a song, because right now it sounds like a kid trying to interpret Sondheim without ever leaving his house his whole life. He needs to sing simpler songs that have little to no emotional attachment, so he doesn't ruin them. Also, John needs to be his own artist and do them at least stylistically different than all the cast albums I own of the songs he did."
1,I'm so upset,"I bought this CD because I trusted Amazons recommendations. I regret though that the CD is horrible. I have these songs already recorded mostly by the original cast. I was expecting John to bring new things to the songs, new feelings, arragments, something. But each song isn't any different than the original recordings. I am very dissapointed in this purchase. Save your money."
5,Reflections from Broadway: An Awesome CD!,"It was a great CD; I especially liked the piano accompianment on it, being a pianist myself! A great CD for any Broadway collection!"
4,Good but....,"I was a little disappointed with some of the songs. Overall, it is a good CD (I love Barrowman's voice!)...I just wish there was a better selection of songs."
3,Not overly impressed,"I am upset to say that I was not overly thrilled with this CD. I really like John Barrowman as a performer but I didn't like the style of the work on this CD. I think that some of the songs sound great, however I think the orchestrations for it could be a lot better. I would say buy this CD to have in your collection, but if you like to hear songs done the way they should be, don't expect them all to be done that way."
2,Why can't you reveal what the song is trying to express,"Thankfully, I only borrowed this CD. Just as the John Barrowman that I saw in Miss Saigon, Phantom Sunset Boulevard and Hair, he continues to try and be JOHN BARROWMAN!!! Where are the characters and feelings that have been written for these songs? I would've have given you more or less, but at least you have a quality voice that would be so much better for B'way or the West End if you weren't so stuck on yourself. You could have better technique and musicianship, too!!!! Sing what the composer and lyricist wrote, portray what the book writer writes and you should have an accomplished performance that no one can fault, but until that day you are a pretty face that should not be on a sound only recording."
2,"Barrowman On Broadway: Fun, But Let's Butch It Up","If you've seen the already cancelled NBC primetime soap ""Titans,"" then you know Barrowman has a tendency to overact. On stage, ie, ""Sunset Boulevard,"" he wasn't bad. He's got plenty of charisma and a legit-sounding Broadway voice. ""Reflections,"" to some extent, furthers that notion. He sings well. In particular, the ballads. But some of what he does is forced and therefore, turns favorite showtunes into effeminate piano bar ditties you're likely to find at some piano bar in Greenwich Village. Maybe, he should hire a vocal coach or acting teacher to help him ""butch"" things up. Or take in a David Campbell cabaret-show (this Aussie also plays the New York cabaret circuit)for pointers."
5,This DVD tells you exactly what Cozumel is like.,This DVD is one of the best videos of Cozumel I have ever seen. We have been going there for over 20 years and I have never seen a video describe Cozumel so truthfully. You did an excellent job. Keep up the good work. I prefer to dive with Aldora Divers and highly recommend them. They cater to your needs and are very safety conscious.
2,The new type of vavle does not work!!!!!,"I was excited about this pool because it seemed really easy to store when not in use. However, the new type of valve does not hold in the air. It says to push it all the way in but the valve on the one I bought would not stay in and when I tried to close the valve the presure from the air inside pushed open the valve and it deflated. It would have been perfect had the valve worked properly."
4,Pleased with product,My daughter got this pool for her first birthday and she loves it. This pool is big enough that I can just get in with her and we have a blast. Because of her age I don't fill it up all the way and it still works just fine. (it just looks a little funny) I found it really easy to set up and easy enough to pack away. I was a little confused at first when folding it up but within moments I had it put away and every time I use it I find it easier and easier. This pool is great for traveling to Grandma's house too! I would recommend this to anyone young and old.
2,Disappointed,I bought this pool based on the durability. I have three boys and was tired of having to buy a new plastic pool every summer. The pool is great except for the fact that NO ONE tells you that you have to fill the pool up completely to get the sides to stay upright. I have a 10 month old and cannot fill the pool that much. If I had know this I would NOT have gotten it. Just bummed.
5,Perfect Size,This is the perfect size swimming pool for my 21 month old. She loves this pool. I love the fact that only the top ring has to be blown up then once you start filling it with water - it stands up. Less risk of tears or holes! The only thing I would recommend would be some sort of cover for it since it does not come with one.
5,We love this pool.,"I purchased this pool because my 2 year old son wanted to go swimming everyday. A blow up pool takes too long to set up, and the plastic pools can be dangerous. This pool sets up so quickly, it does not take much air (maybe 10 puffs) to blow up the top ring.In order for the pool to expand to full size, it must be filled all the way. I filled it about half way for my toddler. The pool was sagging a bit, but my 2 year old loved it.When he was finished, I drained the water, deflated it and folded it up in less than 5 minutes. This is for the person looking for a pool that is easy to set up and take down. If ease of set up and removal are not important, a different pool might be a better choice."
5,Great pool!!,"This is a great little pool. I am on my second pool, as well, but my first one lasted 3 years before the inflatable top ring was punctured. With my new pool, there are patches included, which I'm going to use to patch my old pool--then give that to a friend. The great thing about this pool is that the only inflatable part is the top ring, so you have less chance of getting a hole in it. Of course, if you let your kids get too rowdy in it, and they are jumping on the inflatable ring, it will probably get punctured faster, so don't let them do that, and it will last a long time. For around $[...], you can't beat it!!!"
5,Loved it!,"This pool was a great choice for us. Easy set up, Easy to clean with a brush. And the best part is that it folds up in a little bag for winter storage. We used this pool for 3 years and with proper care, it is still in great shape! That bird review must be a freak thing because I set mine up right next to the bird feeder and the only problem I had was squirrels drinking out of it. Beware! Once they fall in, they can't get out!"
4,Daniel Band:Rise Up,"If you are looking for a no apology, hard rocking Christian Band; then, the Daniel Band is for you. Rise UP is a return to their roots. The fourth release by this pioneering Christian metal band. This was one of their best produced albums with hits like Walk On Water and Rock You this album is a no apology hard rock tribute to the creator. The song Right Heart is one of their best works yet although it did not get much airplay it is one of the most beautiful songs on this album. The lyrics are powerful ad backed up by strong guitar work that exemplifies the heavy metal sound of the 80's. This is true of the entire album. You cannot go wrong buying this album if you are a true 80's metal head."
5,I found a goldmine with this little book,"Having an interest in the subject of medicinal plants, I have been looking for book that explained more about what compounds are in plants and how they affect not only people but nature as a whole. I was intrigued by the concept that plants produce these compounds as defense mechanisms for their own survival, and it is these same compounds that act as medicines (or poisons) when used by people. It also inadvertently explains plant companions for successful gardening. For instance, when Purple Sage leaves are crushed, they release a compound to nearby tomato plants to release their own insect inhibiting compounds. What a great book!"
3,Below Average,"There's a number of ""ghost"" stories like this one - all of them better scripted, This one is so cliche-ridden it's a shame the actor's talents were so wasted. I especially enjoy Sally Fields & her acting talents but she had very little to work with here."
1,Disappointing,"Despite the presence of an ""all-star"" cast, this film was flat. Advertised as a romantic comedy, it was difficult to find either. There simply was no chemistry. While the premise was interesting, it never panned out. The most enjoyable aspects of the film were the set (loved the house) and a scene between the dog and a former priest. That's not saying a lot!"
5,Kiss Me Goodbye,"This movie is timeless. I saw it oh so many years ago and every now and again it would be back on t.v. but I never really got to see the entire thing. I always saw it in parts and I LOVED it. It's very endearing, sweet and funny and James Caan and Sally Field really were at the top of their game when they made this film. It's a rare part for Caan to play and he pulled it off without a hitch. Jeff Bridges also pulled off his part perfectly. I can't say enough about this film. Buy it. You will not regret it!"
4,Kiss me Goodbye,"I like this film, but they could have made it better. I do not think a ghost returning would jsut stand around tap dancing. Sally Field does a good acting job and it has a few funny moments."
5,A GREAT FILM--Even for a Guy who HATES Chick-Flicks,"This romantic comedy has been one of my long-time favorites. I have literally watched this film twice in one day and laughed out loud both times. The perfect blend of chemistry and comedy, it will work for both men and women. Once when watching this movie, my younger brother began to protest, ""I hate girl movies!"" I asked him to give it a chance and briefly explained some of the plot. He laughed so hard that he cried at the film's conclusion and then said the magic words ""You were right."" This is a great little movie that thought it could....if you can muster the open mind, you won't be disappointed. It's romantic without being overly sentimental--funny without overacting--bittersweet and perfectly played. My only regret---it's not on DVD yet. This movie also features a great song by Dusty Springfield, which found at both the introduction and conclusion. BUY THIS!!!!!"
5,One of The Best Movies I've Ever Seen,This movie is an excellent love story. Sally Fields showed a lot of skill in this one. This movie is a great commedy and should be a part of everyone's life.
2,A let down,"I had high hopes for this. I never seen it before and was hoping for a great sci fi classic movie discovery to add to my collection but it was not to be. Very lame story line, totally lame effects with standard fish bowl fish...A real let down."
5,What will they think of next!,"These little bits are simply amazing. I saw them at a demonstration last week and they blew my socks off. They were designed to take the place of spade bits. With six cutting edges on each bit, they are 2 to 3 times faster than a traditional spade bit. The cutting edges allow you to turn 90 degree holes (you have to see it to believe it). You can cut a channel to recess wire, counterbore, cut a quick mortisse, and resharpen the edges with a file or grindstone if they get dull. Nothing like it on the market. The electricians should love Milwaukee for this!"
4,Fine Listening for few dollars!,"I love Bruch and this low cost cd features his first Violin Concerto. The playing is excellent and the interpretation of Rafael Khismatulin makes the cd worthwhile. The familiar Mendelssohn Violin Concerto in E minor seems a bit lacking in spirit, but is competently done. The major problem with this cd is that the sound quality is not up to what one is used to in more expensive cd's. Not terrible, but it sounds a bit flattened out. The performances of the orchestra and soloists are fine, however, and if you want an excellent Bruch rendition, this cd is well worth its easy to take price."
2,Could be a lot better,"Little Evil Things is a great concept. The music is well done, but the writing and voice acting could be a lot better.If you're expecting radio drama style production, this ain't it. These are (ostensibly) scary stories told by a narrator. There are occassionally other actors, but it's primarily first-person narrative with an evocative score throughout each story.The stories themselves are overwrought Twilight Zone clones that start well but end predictably. The voice acting is hit or miss. Some of the stories are well narrated, but others are pretty hokey.Again, it's a great concept that could be executed much better. Perhaps volumes IV and V improve on the idea, but I'm not willing to buy them to find out."
5,Moth - Immune to Gravity,The album is great. Better than most new bands out there. Haven't had a chance to see the live shows but will soon. Anyways go out and get this album. You won't regret it.
2,feels like a rushed debut,"nothing really interesting here beside the song ""Revolution"" which is a clever anthem sharing sentiments with Garbage's ""Boys Wanna Fight"". sounds like a studio-polished bar band, strong musicianship but the album overall is pretty bland... might appeal to blue october fans topically but not nearly as creative as ""history for sale"". It's not that they're incapable, it just seems like they have the potential to produce something much better."
2,Mixed,"I personally thought this was attractive and I like the theme on it, but I bought it for my wife and she was unimpressed. It's a little flimsy, too."
5,Excellent...probably SCC's best CD,"At least, the best of his CDs that I've heard thus far. Every song on this CD is excellent, but my favorites are ""Lord of the Dance"", ""Free"", and ""Let Us Pray"". However, my all-time favorite SCC song is and always will be ""I Will Be Here"". God gave SCC a great gift in music and we are all blessed to hear it and enjoy it!"
5,Keep us the great music! =),"I really like Steven Curtis Chapman's music. I only have 4 of his albums, but I enjoy them all. I love his voice and his messages through his songs. My favorites ever by him are ""way beyond the blue"", ""heaven in the real world"", and 'let us pray"". SCC, you just keeps on getting better. Thanks you for playing the music you do. I find your music very wonderful."
4,Signs of Life Steven Curtis Chapman,I like Steven Curtis Chapman's music because they are encouraging.
2,Buy the magazines instead,If you already have the Stringing Style magazines or can get them don't waste your money on this book. The few new projects are not worth the money. Also these are definitely not the best or most original of the jewelry included in the magazines. I'm sorry I bought this book.
2,An unfortunate disappointment,"When this DVD/CD combo arrived I was really excited. I have the reissue of the original live London concert. However, once I had it in the player my heart sank. The video quality is mediocre at best. Well, I thought, it is twenty-plus years old so maybe the audio will make up for it. Not so. It's not even in stereo! Why bother to go to the expense of making a live recording of what was then a superstar and not do a good job? For those who just want to collect a view of Rick Wakeman in his prime, this will add to your collection. For the rest of you....save your money."
4,This is it!!!!,"I got this one on laserdisc about a year ago as a japanese import. It was filmed in Australia during Rick's tour. Live with orchestra and choir. Full lenght Journey to the Center of the Earth plus some ome Six Wives (Catherine Parr, Catherine Howard and Anne Boleyn) and some King Arthur's (Guinevere and Merlin the Magician).On the LD video and sound are good.If you weren't able to see it or want to relive it, this is it"
3,Try another DVD,"Being a Wakeman fan from the early seventies, I was looking forward to a first DVD of him. What better choice than my fav track; ""Journey to the Centre..."".Well, total disappointment. I haven't yet watched it right through. It certainly captures the 1975 ambience, and it is a glimpse into the past, but that cane chair the narrator sits in is so out of place. In fact, so is he! The ripple FX when changing cameras is rather corny too, but I guess that is part of the 70's thing. I am about to purchase (The Buenos Aires one)a modern DVD with modern recording technology and hopefully see Rick in a way I expect."
3,Not near the quality of the '74 recording,"OK, the photo quality was pretty poor (especially the ""special effects"") and every one looked like they were burned out at the end of a long tour, but I was expecting to get a DVD that at least had the same sound quality as his '74 recording in London. This was far from it. It sounds like they just put a mike out in the audience. My high school concert band recordings' during the same era had better sound.And the orchestra and chior didn't seem to be very good (but it could have just been the sound quality). Many times, they didn't seem to even be in beat with him.It was interesting to see though. I do wish that they would have shown more of his hands on the keyboards, but this was also kept to a minimum. Well, at least I could show my daughter what an old synthesizer looked like."
5,You had to be there . . .,"Just in case you missed it, there is a distinct split in the reviews of this product between those who were there and those who weren't. Those who ""WERE"" tend to love this DVD. Those who ""WEREN'T"" don't.The words of the song say it so well,""It was juvenile,It was something wild.Part of every child,Yeah, you had to be there.It was rough and tough,It was peace and love,All of the above,Yeah, you had to be there.""*Personally, I WAS there (Anaheim Convention Center 1975) and I loved this DVD. I think that if you ""WERE"" too you will . . . too!* excerpted from ""You Had To Be There"" by Peter Frampton"
3,GREAT ARCHIVAL MATERIAL !!!,"Taken on a standalone basis,this is of huge historic value for sympho rock.Extremely well shot for the aussie TV in 75,the picture is OK exhibiting only minor flaws.The sound is not very good and features all kind of noises like mic saturations and audible vibrations especially along the softests passages.A very young long white robed Rick Wakeman with his earliest band is a delight to the eye,but the narrator leaves a lot to be wished especially if we compare it to the one on the cd (a nice bonus-optional subtitles).This is raw vintage live,no big philarmonic orchestra and the place is an open amphitheatre.If you?re looking for a filmed version of what you heard on the cd,forget it.But it?s a nice nostalgia addition to your DVD collection especially if you can find it in a bargain bin like I did."
5,CALL ME A PLONKER IF YOU LIKE BUT...,"...I think this is a great DVD. All the tracks performed are great, and played perfectly, not neccesserily song perfectly though! The sound quality is good, not great and the director has, unlike many concert directors of the 70's, cleverly decided not to use lots of stupid bloody effects. Yeah so Wakemen and Co look like prats in thier 70's get up but hey, I'll live with it. You also get the CD of 'The Journey' which is handy. (if you haven't already bought the CD that is!) So all in this is well worth the asking price. Go on, buy it, you know you want to.What do you mean NO.Look, you buy it or I'll COME OVER THERE AND... CENSORED. Oh well!"
2,A documentary and nothing else,"With so many exciting musical explorations in the 70's, it is disappointing to come across this Wakeman's DVD. This is raw material for a documentary that should be sold in VHS format and for much less. Wakeman is an exceptional musician, and his longing for perfection is hardly recognizable in this product. Stay, and literally dream, with the original CD."
2,What were they thinking?,"It is through performances such as this that I realized how ""hit and miss"" my tastes were back in High School. Then I thought RW was the greatest -- this video proves how dated (and at times ridiculous) his more audacious works are."
5,In the Womb,This is an excellent film detailing conception and subsequent development of a new human being.New technology allows a 3-D scanning image that is remarkable. Procreation is a wonder to contemplate and this film enables you to see into that process with greater understanding.
4,Good book on FBI techniques,"I'm working on a novel, and I needed some insight into how the FBI goes about solving crimes. This book is a basic introduction into just about every class of crime, and FBI techniques used to work the investigations. I still would like better detail, like actual crimes, and exactly how the FBI solved them, but this is definitely a good start."
4,UFC VETERANS OPINION,"If nothing more than entertainment than buy the tape for the various skills involved. I never recieved my copy of the tape after the fight so I had been looking for this tape for a long while. I review every different MMA fights out there. Not just to see what styles they have incorporated with their knowledge of fighting skills but how they morph each style so that it has the best chance of succeeding. I look at all my fights and break it down to what might be a better approach if it exists. I also look at all the fights to see the different approaches of each fighter. You never know, I may have to face them one day. This was my best shape at 375 lbs. and at 17% bodyfat. I know I can do alot better than that for the next time."
3,A little less than the 2nd.,"Enjoyed this one, but not as quite as much previous one. There were a couple places where I wish they had developed things a bit more. Aaron Winslow almost showing up again. The ending also seemed a bit anti-climatic."
3,Inconsistencies Drive Me Batty,"I loved the Women's Murder Club books, but I really can't stand it when readers are insulted by unnecessary inconsistencies. In books 1 & 2, Jill's husband was named Steve and in book 3, suddenly his name is Rick! In book 2, Lindsay's father shared a good relationship with her and she had good memories of him up until her walked out before her mother got sick. She only saw him one other time after he left and she even confronts him for not attending her mothers funeral. However in book 5, suddenly her father was a mean man who didn't walk out until after her Mum died and he was there at the funeral.A little bit more attention to detail would make this series an absolute delight for all readers and fans!"
2,Please say it ain't so...,"Where do i begin? It is obvious that James Pattreson did not write this book because it was not as creative and spellbounding as the first. I considered not reading the rest of the series because of the thrid book. I can only hope that 4, 5 , 6, 7 and now 8 will improve and not waste my time."
4,Another trip with Detective Boxer,"Detective Boxer falling into another case where she needs to pull all the resources of her friends in order to solve this case. On top of that, she finds herself falling for someone. You start to see the female side of Lindsay in this book."
5,Terror at its Best,"I've only read one other of the Women's Mystery Club. I tend to avoid books written under the aegis of a famous author. However I enjoyed the other book, so develed into this one with interest. It reminded me of some of the more current television shows like the one starring a Boston dective and her friend the medical examiner. The book was not a disappointment. It was rather unsettling to lose one of the key club players. Will keep you entranced all the way."
1,what the heck...,"... is going on here??? ...sorry, but I felt compelled to comment upon the ridiculous deluge of reviews which happen to mention The Ghost Country...this is NOT the forum to promote a book in such a way, and no amazon customer is, quite frankly, stupid enough not to realise when a person is logging reviews under multiple names. Shame on you, whoever you are! (Shame on you even more for boosting the average star-review for this dire book!)It looks as if they've all been removed now...which makes this review hugely irrelevant"
3,Murder most foul,"A sad third book with the demise of one of its main characters. Shall have to read the fourth to see who, if anyone, replaces her. Otherwise a reasonable lightweight quick read."
4,Great book,The author never let's me down. Holds my interest right to the end. Can't wait to read book number four.
1,3rd Degree Painful,"Horrid. She's the only one at a formal reception not dressed for the party and although it is crowded, she ""locks eyes"" with the killer [who is in a tux by the way]. Even FBI agents were in gowns and tux! Overall, preposturious and painful to listen to."
4,Explosive,"Another explosive story by James Patterson, 3rd Degree will put you on the edge of your chair, a townhouse goes up in flames and a note is found signed (August Spies) at the scene of the burning building. But is it just another burning building that just caught fire or was it a bomb? The local police are on the scene along with the fire department looking for the reason, is it an act of a terrorist group? Soon more violence in the city and it all points to the group, August Spies. It looks like its all for political reasons and the Women's Murder Club is called into action, will they get to the bottom of who and why? Its up to you to read the book and you too will join their team in San Francisco digging through the ash at the crime scenes. A must read- Larry Hobson-Author- ""The Day Of The Rose"""
4,SEARING THRILLER!,"Apart from the break-neck pace, I love the way Patterson squeezes in contemporary facts and events in his thrillers.This latest in the Women's Murder Club series is every bit as nailbiting as the first two, but with a slight twist: this time, the solution to a grisly string of bombings cannot come without the expense of having to lose someone very close to our amateur detectives.Riveting plot twists. Bullet paced turn of events. This novel packs in just about everything you would expect from a wholesome crime thriller. If you've read the first 2 in the series, you'd probably be even better off as you could relate more easily to the fears and idiosyncrasies of our intriguing protagonists.So feed the cat, turn on the air conditioning and slip into bed with this very, very satisfying nailbiter."
1,Ditch the Ghostwriter!,"This book reads nothing like the earlier two in the ""Woman's Murder Club"" series. Calling it trite fluff is kind. I realize Mr. Patterson is a multi-millionaire, but allowing such dribble to be put out with his name on it is a quick way to lose his audience and his income. I pay for a novel by a particular, proven author and I expect it to be of the caliber of the past works of that author. Shame on you Mr. Patterson."
3,The Book Machine Needs a Rest,"I am an avid Patterson reader, having read all of the Alex Cross and Women's Murder Club books. I am amazed at Patterson's ability in the Alex Cross series to produce a good solid story and develop the characters and up until this book, I held the same opinion of the W.M.C. books. This one seemed to me like a book that was written in a very short amount of time. The plot seemed thrown together and the characters did not seem as seamless as in the past. I would be willing to wait a while for the next book if it translated into Patterson books of the past."
4,3rd time is the charm,"I have been very critcal of Patterson's churning of novels in the last five years. Most of his work's were not up to the standard he set early in career. I am pleased to say that this novel is one of his best efforts in quite a while. The story line is excellent, the action fast paced and the book is a page turner. As is typically in Patteson's novels, the plot is not too deep and pretty easy to figure out. However, I would recommend this book as the best in the current series and suggest picking it up. It will not blew you away, but it is a good novel and worth the read."
1,What a disappointment!,"I enjoyed the first two books in this series, so pre-ordered 3rd Degree. Unfortunately, this third entry is more like an outline of a story than an actual novel. This time around the embarrassingly short three page ""chapters"" seem emptier of content, the characters are two-dimensional, and the implausible actions of the main character Lindsay Boxer are those of a comic book super hero. What were the authors thinking when they wrote this, and how could their editors accept this drivel?"
4,this was a good book,"Like all the other books of that series,I loved it.I wanted to rate it a 5 star book, But It had a sad part in it,I shed some tears when that happened.But like all the other books of that series(Great Book)...The Book owl..."
1,bad co-author,"failed to deliver a realistic enough female detective feeling. she read like a he from the very beginning. and the writing was so tasteless and was just panned out with bad dialogs. i never thought patterson ever reached the status to franchise his name for these bad co-authors. almost unreadable from page 1. i never got hooked up with this bad novel, although had tried at least 3 times."
3,Just Like Patterson,"This is a little less than your typical Patterson as at times it focuses more on romance than the thirll of it.While partial to earlier books where there is more suspense, this book is an easy, light read. Easy summer beach reading."
3,A Fast Light Read,"Okay, so it isn't War & Peace. If you are looking for something fast and light to read, this is it. I read the entire book off and on for a couple of hours. I consider this type of book, a bathtub book. Fill the tub with bubbles, light some candles, have a glass of wine or a cup of tea, read the book and relax.I liked the original James Patterson books featuring Alex Cross. If you are looking for a more intense, indepth detective novel, you need to look there."
3,Good read,Nice to see the girls back in action! Lindsay is a great female lead cop and with her friends there's no case they can't solve.
4,Thrill Ride Feeeerrr Sure!,"Oh, my! What a thrill ride! I was so into this story that I lost all sense of time and almost forgot to pick my kid up from school, yikes! HA! (You'll enjoy this story if are are into this genre)."
1,Wait For The Paperback,"Being a huge fan of James Patterson, this was a disappointment. As one reviewer stated, what a lot of white pages. Next time I won't be wasting my money on a hardback."
4,I still like Alex Cross better!!,Decent read but not as good as the Alex Cross series. I would still recommend it.
1,4th No More?,"Loved ""1st to Die"". Liked ""2nd Chance."" Hated ""3rd Degree."" Is it because this ""Andrew Gross"" person might have wrote it??? If you read ""1st to Die"" and immediately ""3rd degree"" afterwards, you would not believe that the same person wrote the two books. ""3rd Degree"" shouldn't even be part of the ""Women's Murder Club"" series since only one of the 4 characters has a major role and he kills one of them off. Perhaps if James Patterson writes the 4th novel in the series (without Andrew Gross), I might be interested to read it. Otherwise, I'll pass on this series."
1,"Clumsy, laughably fast","This is the most poorly written books I have read in years. The dialog and behaviour of the hero has me laughing every couple pages (not good for a thriller) The 111 ""chapters"" are often one page long, which may tell you something. The romance between the characters develops in a matter of a couple hours. The plot is awkward, and flits from place to place as if they are trying to condense 1000 pages of plot into ten pages. The plot of even bad episodes of Law & Order have more content and hang together better than this. I am hoping that the problem is that the second author wrote most of this, since no bestselling author should write this badly."
2,I'd rather have the 3rd degree,"3rd Degree has all the elements to make it good: a good-looking, fast-talking female detective (Lindsay Boxer), a good-looking, fast-talking female reporter (Cindy), etc, etc, etc., all part of multiple plot lines involving Bad Guys Who Get What They Deserve, Handsome Sexy Good Guys and Blood and Sex.But it's completely implausible. Is the San Francisco Police Department so incompetent that Lindsay is the only one who can investigate? (No! It is not! I live in San Francisco and read and review San-Francisco based detective/crime/noir books and movies. The cops here are not idiots.) She goes everywhere and conducts all the interviews herself. The medical examiner, Claire, is the only one who does autopsies. The reporter, Cindy, appears to be the only employee at the newspaper. She writes all the stories and gets all the communications from the terrorists. Good thing or the plot would never move."
2,Extrememly amaturish writing,"I will not comment on the story, but the quality of the writing is poor. It needs to be edited by a 7th grade English teacher. I recommend that you go to the hardcover version on Amazon and use the ""Look Inside"" feature to read the first chapter. That will provide an example of the writing style so you can decide for yourself it is readable."
5,3re Degree,"As always, James Patterso's books are difficult to put down. Just as you think you can take a break you are seduced into going on. I love this series and hope he keeps on with it so I can know what happens with all of the members of the ""club"""
2,What was he thinking??,"Just when I was beginning to enjoy this new series (especially since I gave up on the Alex Cross series which became too predictable), Patterson removes one of the more appealing characters! Why doesn't he kill off Alex Cross or one of those other boring characters in that series and develop the characters in this series more? I think it may be time to find a new author!"
3,Not Patterson's Best,"3rd Degree was not a bad book. It simply doesn't live up to Patterson's potential. The book, the third in the promising Women's Murder Club series, gets away from many of the things that made the first two books in the series work. The plot relied heavily on Lindsey's character helping to solve the crime but the rest of the ladies were only superficially involved.With that being said, the book was enjoyable and a fast read. The story was solid and started off strong with an explosion that rocked San Francisco and action that continued at a fast pace throughout most of the book. However, the story lacked any shocking plot twists that Patterson's books have become known for and the only real surprise comes early in the book. So while it is a fun read, don't expect anything earth shattering."
2,Reads like a bad sequel,"As much as I've like some earlier writings, this seems like a half heart effort. It's typical Patterson plot, i.e., tragic event, single investigator getting over lost love, major tragic event, then good guys get bad guys just in time. Not only is this wearing thin, the chapters average about 3 pages. I bring this up because when you account for white space, the book is reads more like a short story than a novel. If you like reading a book a day, pick this one on a day you're really busy. Suggestion to Patterson - Break the pattern next time (example - write from the perspective of the ""evil doer"") and you're following will stay in tow."
2,Poor story by usually reliable author,"I have enjoyed many of James Patterson's novels in the past, most notably The Beach House and The Jester. I had never read one of the Women's Murder Club series, but thought I would give it a try. What a disappointment! The story started out well, but quickly deteriorated. The love story was just terrible and very forced. The women don't really do anything useful to catch the killers, but just happen to be part of the law enforcement team that is after the spies. The ending was just awful with no new information, surprises, or excitement. The last few chapters were completely unnecessary and boring. I would not recommend this book and would suggest some of Patterson's other works instead."
5,excellent book....a must read for the series,"Having been a Patterson for some years now, I couldn't wait till this book came out. It was such a good book that I started it the night I got it and finished it by the next morning! It was one that I found hard to put down. I don't think I have yet read a Patterson book I haven't liked but I'm still making my way through his books. Definitely a must read. I hope he keeps up with this series. Like his Alex Cross series this an excellent series. Good strong lead characters with good supporting ones as well. The stories are excellent and not hard to follow."
2,Bad sequel,"I can't believe 3rd Degree was written by the same writer who wrote the previous two books in the Lindsay Boxer series. Like the other two, this was a quick page-turner, and usually that equals a good story, but this read like a detective comic book with one stereotype character after another. I won't even bother with the next installment of this series."
1,I Didn't Like It-What Happened to Mr. Patterson here?,"This book started out interestingly enough, but after about 100 pages-it really bored me a lot. The pieces just didn't seem to fit together and the story took off in other strange directions that was difficult to relate to the first part of it. Frankly, it had me confused.The other books in this series were great, but James lost his touch on this one. For another thing, the characters were underdeveloped!"
2,IT'S A WOMEN'S WORLD,"The main plot of terrorists within the USA going after people they believe are harming the world is ok, but nothing really inventive. The story loses a great deal of crediblity when one of homicide detective Lindsay Boxer's friends is murdered and she is not pulled from the case. Heck, one of her other friends performs the autopsy as she watches.I wasn't a big fan of one of the main character themes in this book. Basically, it is written from the point of view that all men are either abusive and evil, or nice but stupid. Talk about sucking up to the women readership. Meh."
3,SPOILER! HE KILLED OFF JILL?!?!?!?!?!?!?,"I can't believe he killed off Jill!!!!! I mean, Yukie's nice, but is she really a cool replacement for Jill?"
5,Minus 1 for the Club,This book was great. I have the unabridged CD. This really thrill me. The sound effects were awesome. Way to go James.I was however so disappointed when we lost Jill. So now where do we go from here. We really got the 3rd Degree in this book.I love all the ladies in the Women's murder club. So now lets get to the 4th is a charm. I can't wait. I read 1st to Die and2nd Chance. So I had all the information on all the ladies.Keep up the good work. I have most of your books in hardcover. And some of the books I also have on CD and tapes. I also like that in some of the audio books you have two readers. It adds much suspense to the story. I collect all your books.Thanks for keeping me in suspense and this was a real page turner.Thanks
2,disappointed,I was disappointed in this book. This does not mean I will not continue to read Patterson books. I just didn't get into this book. Patterson is an excellent storyteller and all his other books I have read have been great.
5,Exciting - Page Turner,I love James Patterson. All of his books are so interesting and not typical of any suspense novels I have read. His books are page turners and this one is no different. I love the club and how he has his readers feel like they are part of this club trying to figure out all the clues. This book is hard to put down and there is no way of ever guessing how the ending is going to be. Highly recommend this series of book starting with the first one.......First to Die.
2,Reads Like a Lifetime Movie,"I've read the first three and do love Patterson's Alex Cross series. The Women's Murder Club plays out too much like a Lifetime Movie or a soap opera with some mystery thrown in around it. Patterson's writing is his norm, but these characters and stories leave me skimming through and hoping to quickly reach the end."
3,A Small Diversion,"This series has well drawn characters, but Patterson is skimming near the edge of trying to write from places he has no knowledge. Writing murder mysteries from the viewpoints of four strong women is challenging enough without throwing in the psychology of spousal abuse. Much like the Alex Cross novels, I fear the series is beginning to rely too much on the reader's memory and forgiveness and not enough on the novelist's writing skills and imagination."
3,was not the best JP,This was not the best james patterson i have read. was a bit confusing at times. i am looking forwaard to 4th of july.
2,Well I Never!!!,"I never thought I'd see the day when a James Patterson book, could put me to sleep. What a colassal bore!!! He sold out the Women's Murder Club and put in this dribble with Lindsay falling in love - what?? One of the girls is gone forever and I found myself saying ""so what?"" How promising he made them in the first 2 books. Mr. Patterson totally missed me with this one. That means that he will have to earn my trust again. The next book of his that comes out, I will pick it up from the library - not spend my hard earned on it. I'm pulling for the next book. He has so entertained me in the past."
3,Certainly Not One of His Best Shots,"I read his books as soon as they come out and waited with baited breath for this one as I enjoyed the first two in this genre. I was disappointed. First, I didn't find the character development which was so great in his other books quite as believable in this book. Second, I didn't see what spousal abuse had to do with the story, and when Jill was killed, I couldn't figure out why (in the long run). I liked her character and looked forward to her in future books. I like the ""out there"" plots, but in the past everything has fit together.It would be nice if our little star would get married.I know he can't bring Jill back, but hopefully he doesn't kill off any other important parts.Sorry! But I'm waiting for his next Alex Cross novel. And I'll probably buy it the day it comes out and read it right away and forgive him for this one.JNParsons@comcast.net"
1,Horrible condition,Binder was ripped/cracked at both ends and the whole book was rippled due to past contact with water.
1,Juvenile Disappointment,"This book is written at the sixth-grade level. Sentences are often simple declaratives. The characters are sticks that talk to each other, but reveal nothing but their inner selves or thoughts. Also written in the first-person.The book is a page turner, because each chapter begins half down the page, lasts all of one page, leaving the second page half empty. If consolidated, the book would have all of about 100 pages. There are 111 such chapters.Not recommended."
5,"""Third"" time's a charm!","I'm a big fan of James Patterson and the Women's Murder Club especially. This book rocks! With a suprise twist that will shock regular readers of this series, it is by far the best of James Patterson I've read so far. Right up there with ""Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas"", which is a completely different genre.Short, quick, can't put it down chapters mean you'll finish this book in a day, maybe two."
3,An average novel from an author who once wrote better,"I found 3rd Degree to be just average. In comparison to some of his earlier novels, this book seemed to be all about little snippets. None of the chapters are very long, and many of them are 2-3 pages. The characters don't have any real depth. It feels like you are reading a screenplay, instead of a novel, mostly due to that lack of depth.The one good thing about this novel is, it isn't ""The Lake House"". That might just be the worst novel published in the last 10 years.If this is your first James Patterson novel, you will do ok with it. If you have read some of his earlier works, like ""Kiss the Girls"", or ""Along Came a Spider"", you will find this a little more lacking."
3,Another smart woman doing stupid things.,"I get so tired of herioines who are described as ""intelligent"" but keep doing things that no one in their right mind would do in order to create something supposedly exciting. In my mind, its cheating. In this story, I feel that Lindsay is doing the same thing. It just really isn't believable. This is the 3rd and probably last book I'll read of this series. Stick with Alex Cross. I think Mr Patterson understands the male hero better than the heroine. This book kept my attention but was ultimately very unsatisfying in the end."
1,Ad hominum attacks reveal more about the writer,"This book is pretty amusing. Every time you read ad hominum attacks, such as those in this silly book, you realize how unsophisticated the writers are. Even more unsophisticated: dedicating a book to someone you hate! Now that's scholarship!Also amusing are the reviewers who spew hatred -- you really have to get a life! If your self-esteem was solid, you wouldn't be such a crybaby. Boo hoo."
1,Imperialist Propaganda,"I have not read this book, and do not need to. After one reviewer compared Chomsky to Grima Wormtonge in The Lord of the Rings, I had to laugh. Any one who has read Chomsky will know that these pathetic attempts to undermine one of the only people who has a pretty clear idea of what is happening in the world today are just one more attempt by the imperialists to create misinformation. America is a country founded on genocide and control and the real apologists are those who would justify our terrorist actions agasinst the rest of the world. But for those readers who want to continue living in an ethnocentric fantasy world where America is a benevolent super power fighting evil terrorists, this book will probably provide plenty of self-deluding niceties."
5,Chomsky the Hyprocrite,Chomsky is a hyprocrite. He criticizes the very type of system that sent his sales skyrocketing after Hugo Chavez equaled Bush to the devil. I mean come on. For what reason does Chomsky continue to suggest that Capitalism is a system from hell itself but then get rich off of it by someone like Chavez whom promotes his works?Not to mention also being involved with a variety of nefarious movements as well.
2,The beauty of free speech,"It's doubtful that Chomsky is concerned about being ignored by The New York Times these days, since he recently published a very long article there (""A Wall As A Weapon""). To the claim of Holocaust revisionism, I should say that I'm the son of a Holocaust survivor, so I take this seriously. This charge stems from an essay he wrote about free speech, which he allowed to be attached to a book by a French crackpot, who claimed that the Holocaust never happened. What Chomsky wrote in the essay is that (a) he hadn't read the book and (b) didn't think it was even worth reading. He went on to say that if we're in favor of free speech, we have to allow it precisely for views we despise, even without bothering to read them. The same hold true for this book. Free speech. Write whatever you want."
1,Huh?,"The book is quite unusual. At first I didn't think it real. It is designed for people who do not read or know Chomsky. Just plain infantile slander, criminal really. The authors misrepresent the most basic aspects of his career. And what is an ""anti-reader?"" It is silly as the book is lunacy."
4,"A Solid, Reasonable Critique.","I found the majority of the criticism leveled at Chomsky in the book to be reasonable. Therefor as matters of opinion they're plausible. Surprisingly it hasn't been the contents of the book that has led me to believe theses criticisms ring more true than not. It has been the reaction TO the book and the character of that reaction that has me thinking there is more going on with Chomsky than simply his ""speaking to power"". Based upon the rabid, ""cultish"" nature of Chomsky's defenders. It appears that its Collier and Horowitz who are challenging the orthodoxy and legitimacy power often mistakenly assumes. Upsetting the conventional wisdom its followers embrace at the expense of critical thought.Extremely enlightening"
1,This book is terrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrible.,"Whats funny about this book is that when Chomsky states a fact, he cites a primary source in which one could find that fact if needed. Usually his sources come from unclassified government documents and other credible primary documents. If you have never read Chomsky yet read this, you wil be highly misguided. This book is so full of propaganda and crappy refutation it's pathetic."
1,My God!!!!!!!!,"After reading some excepts from this obvious monstrosity of a book, and some of the reviews, I was tempted to write an in-depth defense of Chomsky's views. However, since I am short of time, and hope that my defense could possibly alter the weltanschauung of Chomsky's critics (a generous label for many of them I know) I will leave the reader with this quote from Bertrand Russell about another controversial Jewish philosopher: ""Spinoza is the noblest and most lovable of the great philosophers...ethically he is supreme...As a natural consequence, he was considered, during his lifetime...a man of appalling wickedness."" I think this should tell you all you need to know about those who depict Chomsky as immoral and wicked."
1,Pure Tripe,"I own this book with about 25 other Chomsky books. Anyone familiar with his works will notice how things are distorted out of context to the point of absurdity. Equating anti-America and anti-Israel simply because he speaks out against the abuses of the two governments is a petty play on words.Im not going to bother doing anything but urging people to read up on the workds of Chomsky and compare it with this book. The lies, distortions and pathetic attempt to demonize Noam is ridiculous. Every claim in this book has been addressed. All the readers have to do is look and see the truth for themselves."
1,Chomsky is not a bad guy,"This book made me laugh. I rented it from the library because it isn't worth a peso swallowed and passed into a bowl of vomit and headcheese soup. It did use ad hominem and other fallacies to a nauseating effect. If you like a dose of logic in your arguments, you won't like this book. I read it because it is important to hear all sides of an argument, even purile arguments like the ones David Horowitz tends to favor. Any who, have a nice day, and try not to let hate devour your souls, your minds, and your world."
2,Partisanship,"Anyone who gives this book either 5 stars or 1 star is clearly a partisan hack and has no interest in clarity or reality. Ideology is annoying, ugly, and useless, and people like Horowitz and Chomsky illustrate this lucidly.So if you claim that this book ""is the factual truth"" or just the ramblings of ""hate mongers,"" you have given me prima facie evidence that you're a twit. Good day."
1,"Jingoism and liars, or the rabid secular priests of power","One can analyze this book in very few words: clumsy lies, outright misinformation, and a very careless manipulation of events that have been twisted and mixed with pure science fiction to suit the purpose of the authors. Their attempt to construct any valuable argument has been so badly woven, the book reads more like a bad comedy than a political argument.The purpose is clear, and so is the technique. In order to try and refute Chomsky's monumental body of work, these two scream, and whine, and yelp in a common tactic of the most rancid far-right: invent as much garbage as you can and throw it around. Somebody may even believe it, even if only part of it.The result of the authors' clumsy tantrum is hardly worthy of a couple of pre-school kids. You can find actual arguments against progressive ideas around. No need to waste your time with this joke."
1,funny,"Horowits and Derschowitz ,,both much less smarter than chomsky,it seems to me, after failing to get anything done in their books, finally turned to attacking the one of the smartest and the most honest man in the world. Before actually reading this book written by those zionists, read actual chomsky's book to see how clear and straight argument he is commanding. Mr chomsky is the one who will be remembered as one of real hero both in linguist and human rights activity.. And those anti -chomsky authors will be remembered as transient useless critics."
1,"stick to writing mawkish memoirs, Horowitz","Insipid self-referential musings about his life as a former leftist seem to be Horowitz's forte. His desperate effort to grasp within his paws some of the notoriety and credibility that Chomsky has rightly attained over the years is a painfully transparent manifestation of Horowitz's self-consuming envy of Chomsky. Anyone staking a claim to the title of ""intellectual"" (a title to which Horowitz has repeatedly and patently aspired over the years, with increasingly bizarre results) would instantly recognize Horowitz's willingness to utilize hypocrisy and contextual misrepresentations in order to pass himself off as an authority on leftist falsifications simply by virtue of having been a leftist himself. The book's value lies only in its insight into the anfractuous reasoning of its author, a man who decided many years ago that he'd rather apostasize than fight an uphill battle."
1,Please...,"Attacks like this are fruitless and contribute nothing to the great national debate. The Right has crucified Michael Moore for quoting out of context. But it's OK for Horowitz and company? That is irrational.It would do us all good to shelve the ""well Limbaugh said, well Franken opined"" ideologies and instead focus on facts, and a collective search for the truth for the benefit of all. Because in the end, I've got a revelation for all Americans: It's not about you and your ideas. It's not about me and my opinions. It's about all of us working together for the good of all humanity.And bitter, sensationalist, Jerry Springer show hack jobs like this do nothing to further that cause."
5,It's About Time somebody took on chomsky,"I wish every reader of Chomsky would go out and read this book. Unfortunately, most won't. The Anti-Chomsky Reader illustrates Chomsky's hatred towards Israel, and how he got into bed with a holocaust denier and his cadre of jew-haters. Chomsky not only hates Israel - he hates America too, and believes that the US had it coming in 9/11. I only with the book had been bigger..and that they could have covered Chomsky inability to protest the lack of free speech on campuses. Silly me - the only speech allowed on campus is leftish hogwash...no wonder he is not protesting."
1,Complete slander of a humanitarian thinker,"Aside from the fact that the publisher of this book, Encounter Books, is affiliated with the Project for a New American Century, the think tank that staffs the Bush White House and created its post-9/11 foreign policy of pre-emptive war, the axis of evil, and everything else Bush relies on to fight the war on terror, a full year BEFORE 9/11, the book is also full of complete misrepresentation. Chomsky never sided with that lunatic French author who denied the holocaust. He never denied Pol Pot's atrocities. He is not anti-American. He only asks Americans to apply the same standards to themselves as they apply to other nations. When we do that, we discover that, often times, our government deceives us into believing we are the moral crusaders of the planet, while we bomb civilians into ash and support death squads and dictatorships across the planet. Why not mention that little tidbit, Horowitz?"
1,Smear Against Chomsky by Writers Who Apparently Haven't Read Much Chomsky,"Anyone who has read Chomsky knows he called 9-11 an atrocity; that he was extremely critical of the Soviet Union, Maoist China and that he called the holocaust, ""the greatest madness in human history.""That these writers could so distort Chomsky as to deny the above is evidence that they are not interested in facts. Like another reviewer has said, Chomsky's main work is cataloging facts largely ignored by mass media. He actually shows a reluctance even to state his own opinion. Rather, he quotes, US government officials or documents -- rather than listening to spokespersons and their media stenographs -- to try to find out what the US government is really thinking."
1,Hilarious,"This edited volume features an assortment of ex-leftists and Zionists throwing everything at Chomsky, including the kitchen sink. Many of the contributors fail to see the irony in devoting an entire book to trashing a man they accuse of being irrelevant.Aside from a few debatable criticisms of Chomsky's linguistic theory, the most this work can do is find Chomsky guilty by association. Big deal."
1,More rant than objective review,"There are a ton of reviews here about this that go on and on and on. I am sure they have put all of you to sleep. YAWN. This material is so subjective, that I doubt any review can do anything this personal justice.My feeling on this book is simple - It seemed and read more like a ""We don't like Chomsky, so we are going to rip apart everything he has ever said or written"".I do not feel it was honest analysis. It felt like two angry little children trying to cash in on the Chomsky name. It felt more like two little kids using big words, yet, essentially saying, ""Not uh, Not uh. See, I told you so."" and nothing more than that.Was it boring. YES! Wow, I think reading every DVD player installation manual ever printed would have been more enjoyable. Really."
5,Contrary to Chomsky Goose-Stepping Orcs,"David Horowitz has created an easy to read, thoughtful dissection of all things Chomsky. If you have heard of Democrat politicians (like Clinton) giving homage to Chomsky, you need to read this book to find out why. Eye-opening!"
1,simplistic character assassination,"After reading this book its plain that what we have here is a character assassination against a great patriot and teller of truth with encyclopedic details of American foreign policy. Pin headed neo-cons as well as the ""liberal"" elite (New York Times) have all disparaged Chomsky for not following the line of political correctness dictated by the Corporate/Government framework of discourse. If the lest and the right hate you, but can't refute your facts, then you must be onto something."
5,I keep coming back...,"It seems I need to pull this out and listen to it every six months. I end up playing the tracks for a few weeks and then distractions arise, but I always go back to it again in six months. It's a weird type of craving. I highly recommend this disc if you enjoy great music with accomplished guitarists. The drummer has a style all his own too.I remember seeing them live at a show here in Florida when they were around. I was hooked instantly! It really is a shame that they haven't produced anything else collectively."
5,One of the greatest Christain one album wonders,"I picked this album up when it was new back in the 90's and I still think its fantastic, and one of my favorites. I found this on amazon, (about 15 years after my purchase) while looking for a possible second album, but as of yet I have not found one. So I thought I would post a comment in hopes that the band would make a second album. Like so many other people have said, its too bad they made only one...."
3,"worth the money, but is it worth the memory?","The free versions of these volumes are not indexed, which makes them hard to use, and the tredition versions are relatively high in price(three to four dollars each), so I was pleased to find this ""complete"" edition in the Kindle store, as such a great price. I was horrified, however, to discover nearly all my available memory had been gobbled up by this mammoth file. I guess you have to pick your classics wisely."
3,An academic examination,"Okun clarifies the issues surrounding the tradeoff between equality and efficiency, rather than taking a firm position on the issue of how much society should exchange one for the other. Was rather hoping for a more spirited point-of-view than this highly-academic elucidation of the issue. Reading this will illustrate just how extreme the Republican party has moved since the book's original publication in the mid-1970's."
2,"It was a forced-read, so I wasn't too keen on it to start...","When I attended Reed College, my economics professor assigned this book as a ""quick read."" Unfortunately, the book is rather dry, and I didn't pull much out of it. If you have the time to actually re-read passages, go ahead and pick it up if the topic interests you. Otherwise, forget about it, because I had one night to read it, and the results were the same as if I didn't read it at all."
4,Good but Not Great,"This is an interesting book, and has proven to be a classic in the field, but it's nothing too exciting. The author's basic point is summarized in the title (public policy faces a tradeoff between economic efficiency and the equal allocation of resources) and is not really that controversial. His policy recommendations are often somewhat dated, but still make worthwhile reading."
