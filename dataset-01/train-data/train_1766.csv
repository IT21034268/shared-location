1,This book is Crap!!!!!!!!,"before purchasing this book, I thought this was going to be a very good book because it was by Alias, I was totaly disappointed and wrong; mostly because of errors and lack of explanations on some of the tutorials. This book freaking sucks!!!!! The author is not clear on some things and does not give very clear examples of what to do. (lesson 02 pg.75). It seems he assumes you know what to do even though this book states it is for the novice too.Oh well,I'm going to think twice about ordering another alias publised book."
4,One of the best tutorial books I've used,"I've learned most alot of 3DMax from tutorial books so I'm grounded, but this book has a great progression that enables you to understand the program and pick details on how the interface works. Working around the movie definitly makes the activites feel more relevant. Money well spent"
1,Useless,"This book is weighty, full-colored and honestly, looks pretty cool when it comes in the mail. The problem starts when you go to use it. For someone like myself who has absolutely no prior 3D animation expierence, this book is horrible. It skimps on steps, the steps it tells me to do fail to work in the program, the dozens/hundred of menu options are not labeled when you're doing the steps and then a few pages over it'll tell you to go to visor window and you're all, what? Visor menu? What in the world is that? Then you have to waste valueable time searching for the elusive menu.I would not recommend this book to anyone who has no prior knowledge or expierence. It's a fairly useless book if you need help pinpointing how to do something because the only way you'll be able to do anything out of the book is to do every single page until you've worked your way up to where you need to be."
1,Don't buy this DVD,"I had a different idea of what this DVD would be. It has a young girl on the cover and 80+ minutes of instruction but, the actual ballet instruction for kids is maybe around 25 minutes. The other hour just watching older dancers, learning about point dance and the shoes. Its almost like a documentary, so your little primaballerina will find most of this boring. The actual instruction is being interpretted into english and doesn't really give you comprehensive instruction on the ballet moves. If your child is already in ballet then it might make more sense to them, but I'm not sure if they will find if fun and once you've watched it once, most likely they'll never want to watch it again."
4,A Very Good Value,"The Panasonic SCPM11 offers a very good feature set at a very good price: 5 CD changer, high power, clear sound, fairly good frequency response, and a good remote. Not a bad looking unit either, but not exactly ""sexy."" The low points: Not as deep a bass response as more pricey units, no PlayExchange (i.e., does not let you swap out CDs while one is playing), no custom equalization, and a noisy changer that will probably wake you up if you use the ""sleep"" function. If you're willing to forego these shortfalls, it's definitely worth considering."
3,Almost,"I almost purchased this product, but discovered that it does not have ""play exchange."" This feature allows you to change discs while one is playing. Instead I bought the Sharp XLHP500, which I am very happy with."
3,"good, but not great","It seems to be written by a traditional Christian, who does not believe that the Feasts are for the Gentile. It is written for educational purposes of what the Feasts are about for the Jews and is not for the Messianic Believer trying to learn why the Feasts apply to the Gentile Believer in Messiah Yeshua. It does contain historical background, practical application, and prophetic meaning, so it is good for learning about the Feasts, but he doesn't appear to believe that they are for the Gentile who has been grafted in. Kind of disappointing, but it is good for information."
5,Wonderful Passionate Story,"Addiu, Bedda Sicilia spans nearly half a century in the life of it's main character Gino, his experiences, his loves and his passions. Surrounding Gino is a mini history of his immediate family and friends, and trail of family members and friends stretching from Sicily to California. The depth, breadth and character of this story is both sweeping and riveting. It is heartwarming at times and heartbreaking to tragic at other times. This story is absolutely captivating to read."
4,A good reference book,"I bought this book for my Media Arts class at Los Angles Valley College. But this is more than just a textbook. It it a great reference book on who's who with the agents, when to seek an agent, the responsibilities of various people who work behind the camera. It covers writers, Directors, producers, and other movie industry jobs. It's a very good book. LAST, IT'S ALSO WRITTEN SO THAT IT IS EASY TO READ CASUALLY, AND NOT LIKE A SCHOOL TEXTBOOK."
3,Decent for novice people interested curious about working in Hollywood.,"This is one of those books which should be light reading for people on the outside who are curious about Hollywood. Not a great resource for someone in the business or just starting to book jobs on film sets. Most of this will have already been rudely crunched into your brain if you are already moving along your film career path. I guess this makes sense with the title being 101. This is a decent quick intro read. If you really want a good resource book, check out DOWN AND DIRTY PICTURES: THE RISE AND FALL OF MIRIMAX....."
1,useless,"if you are already in filmmaking you might know all that this book covers. if you are not, i don't see how this book could help you to get in. maybe if you have no idea of what you want to do in the business... but even than..."
1,Find a different program instead!,"I thought the Kliplinger Will program would be as functional as their TaxCut software, but clearly this program falls short. The instructions were bad, and what drove me the MOST crazy was that there was no delete feature (if you mistakenly list your mutual fund under a savings account, for example, you can't just delete or recatogorize the entry).When I printed my V-E-R-Y simple will, the program managed to spit out 45 pages of lawyer-speak. What a waste of paper.I can't return this dog fast enough. Thankfully Kiplinger allows a 60 day period for a full refund. I'm going to try the Quicken program instead."
2,Willpower,Product had an error when entering the data. Called technical support and explained the error condition and even the cause. They seemed to have no interest in attempting to correct the problem. After a few attempts they did finally refund my money so I have to give them credit for that.
1,Will power is buggy,"I purchased this product with the expectation that it would at least function properly. Unfortunately, the product has some serious bugs. I have installed, uninstalled, and reinstalled the product on my Mac (G4 runnig OSX Panter) to no avail. If all you want to do is create a power of attorney then this is the product for you. Otherwise, spend your money elsewhere."
2,Too thin,"Though the pashmina seemed a reasonable price, the quality bares no resemblance to that of the pashminas one can get at a lesser cost from street vendors in NY city. The weave is very thin and one can see right through it. It would, I suppose, be fine as a light cover on a warm summer evening but does not add any warmth if that is the goal. It also appears a bit skimpy in size."
3,Super thin,"Perhaps this is really 100% Pashmina and that is why it is so thin? While is serves it's purpose as a scarf, I was disappointed by its see-through sheerness."
4,Black Pashmina,"A fine, thin, and light-weight pashmina, it is an ideal extra layer and drapes beautifully.The silky texture feels comfortable around a bare neck as well."
2,Bootleg. Be Ware!,"While like most Elvis fans, I was very happy to FINALLY find this album on CD. BUT. What you get is a cheap CD Bootleg from Mexico. The sound quality is ""Fair"". But the old saying, Buyer Beware. I didn't pay more than $15.00 for my copy. Do not pay more than $10.00 for this disc."
4,Good background on the militaries,"For those of you interested in military matters in the Middle East, and who is not, these days? A very recent (2002) book that covers the militaries of several countries in the region. A chapter each on Syria, Egypt, Israel, Palestine, Jordan, Turkey, Iraq and Iran. Plus a discussion of US and Russian involvement.Very readable. Though, needless to say, the chapters on the Iraqi army of Saddam Hussein, and on the US, are now outdated. The book was printed in 2002, but the text was written prior to 11 September 2001. So there is little discussion of terrorism/guerilla activity. Don't let this deter you. The book still gives a good briefing on the armies. Useful background for current affairs."
4,Francisco gets badly translated.,"I haven't read this book. But I think that maybe it would be good if the only review --which is in spanish-- were translated. Here's Francisco's review:This edition is important on the themes of environmental economy and the underestimation of ecosystem health, for humanity surges to break little known ecosystems, synergies, and the diverse benefits they bring, much of which we don't know.So, this book approaches the important elements, for the process of optimizing the utilization of ecosystems, from philosophic, environmental, and economic perspectives."
2,mom of twin boys,My 15 month old twin boys received this as a gift for their first birthday. I was so surprised that a toy from Home Depot was so flimsy. Out of all the walking toys they have this is the one that is the least sturdy. It is constantly being knocked over. I was not satisfied at all. I will probably never buy a Home Depot brand toy again.
4,Overpriced here!!!,"I wanted to add this to a wish list for my son, but through this site it is DOUBLE what you can pay for it at Toysrus. Buyer beware!"
2,Looks better than it performs,"I have only borrowed gardening tools for the very limited amount of gardening thus far. I now want to garden as a hobby and thought I should have a nice new set of tools for myself. After reading the rave reviews and given the cute design with bright green handles, I decided to purchase this set. I like the light weight feel of the pieces, but as far as ergonomic, I can't tell the difference between this design versus the standard designs. I even find that the standard design works better such as the cultivator, this one is much harder to use because the the claw is more sparse and is thicker at the end giving it more difficulty penetrating the dirt. The trowel did okay, but found that the the metal to be easily scratched. I don't have any wrist or hand problems so did not notice whether ergonomic design is beneficial or not."
5,Goodbye hand pain,These tools work great for a 60ish woman with hand pain. They did not bend in our hard Colorado soil.
5,Exactly what I pictured,My sister is going to love this!! They are very sturdy tools and they are super adorable. Perfect for your favorite gardener.
4,good stuff,Items arrived quickly and completely. Would rather have known the product was not produced in the USA. Product does look like it will hold up over time.
2,broke the long shovel the first time,"I have heavy clay soil, and I broke the long shovel the first time I used it. For light use and light soils, these might be fine, but they are not professional grade heavy duty tools."
2,"Ordered the tool set, the cultivator arrived broken.","The tools seem like they're built well. They feel good in your hands. However, the cultivator either broke in shipping or was broke when I got it. I believe that says something of the quality of the steel. Amazon offered to replace it, but I have to send the whole set back. That's not a problem -- I just don't expect these to hold up under any serious gardening task. I'd probably go for the Fiskar set in retrospect. I'll upload the pictures of the broken tool."
1,bends to quickly,"These items were great at first, but with daily use on the weeds the long one broke in two. BUt before that I thought this was the greatest weeder ever!"
3,Seems adequate,My mom seemed to like them. Her arthritis has gotten worse so has not been using them much. Otherwise good
5,scientific poetry,"This book has rhyming, soothing, poetry coupled with fantastic pictures (mostly photographs.) There are short informational paragraphs on each page which can be read, or paraphrased from to further explain the rhyming text or pictures to inquisitive kids. Lots of interesting facts about light and outer space! The poetry will help the kids retain the information."
2,Works but bad strap.,The watched worked fine and was at a good price but the strap broke off after six months. I went ahead and bought another Timex but one with a better strap design.
4,For fans only.,If you're a fan of The Wire series then you'll enjoy the DVD. Bottom line. Point blank. I'm not going to speak on the aesthetics of the production because that's not what one would buy the DVD for. But if you're a fan of The Wire then you'd enjoy the DVD.
1,Horrible Documentary,"I loved The Wire!!... hated this documentary. Mellowdramatic narration, cheesey reenactments and weak interviewing completely ruin what could have been a really compelling documentary."
3,It's alright but ....,"DVD is not set up with an end jump that gets you back to the main menu, or the start - not very professional."
1,Low budget,"Don't waste your money, if you are a true fan of the wire! The documentary was a cheap run. The actor Wood Harris made Avon Barksdale character seem very interesting than the real Barksdale. The documentary reminded me of a boot leg DVD."
3,satisfied,"As advertised pizza cutting tool. It has a very sharp edge, be careful. Just need to add handle for comfort when cutting."
3,Complex reading,"Very detailed analysis of how we got our current industrial/corporate landscape with suggestions for an alternative network of flexible, smaller, specialized firms...if I've understood the authors correctly."
4,Good... expect a lot of control theory,"To take full advantage of this book you need a good background in control theory (mandatory!) and mechanics. The book has excellent information about the variables, approximations and all the stuff relating to gasoline and diesel engines. If you need a more in depth understanding of the principles sometimes explained superficially in ""tunning engines books"", this is the literature you need, but please have close to you a ""mechanics for dummies"" in case you get lost with the formulas.This book has some references to an ECU's software guidelines but no program example is presented.The drawbacks: in some figures the letters are missing or misplaced making them a quiz."
2,Missing pages and subscript,"I bought this book because this is a text book for my degree courseI noticed there are missing subscript on the one figure.My instructor allowed me to compare his book and my book, the what I found are,1. Page 61 and page 62 is missing.2. Missing subscript on (31) figures.I recommend you to check the book right away after receving the book.Amazon, could you send me the good one to me?I know it had already passed one month after my receving the book, but the book is a bad one."
4,Very pleased.,This was my first purchase of music by this group. I was very pleased and would rate it a 4 1/2.
5,Worth the money,"Worth every penny. We have an induction stove, so we had to get a cookware set that would work - I decided to bite the bullet and get the one that was rated the best and could not be happier. Very high quality, balanced, beautiful finish."
2,Not as good as the other two,"I love the DK Episode's VI-IV & I,II Vehicles and Locations but I found the Episode III Space ships and Vehicles not all that amuseing I feel that it wasn't a completed book to end the spectacualr tiology books in the detailing of the great space ships and vehicles. The reason why I didn't get this one as my collection was becuase I didn't see Padme's Naboo Skiff, which we really didn't get to see much in the film, but i would of have liked to see the detaling at least . Over all it's a great book but not enough."
5,Rick's a cool guy,"Having experienced the Yaak during winter, a few years in a row, I know what it's like... Kinda boring but very pretty. That was a few years ago, when I was a young teenager. I knew Rick and his family; I went to school with his daughters. In fact, his oldest daughter was one of my best friends. I remember one time I stayed over at their house with another one of our friends and we played hide-and-seek, and Rick was the seeker. It was a lot of fun. Anyway, I actually haven't read any of his books, I just wanted to say that Rick Bass is a great person, and if I could ever find his books in the local library, I'd read them, and definitely suggest them to other readers."
1,Not good.,"Looking through books for ones to send to the thrift store, this one leapt to the fore. Each of the three times I've sat down to read it, I've soon set it aside, thinking 'life's too short to spend with books like this.' Rick Bass may be a great guy (some reviewers point out that he is), but this book is forced and soulless. Within my own experience with environmental nonfiction, ""nature writing"" as some will call it, I can think of nothing with which this book would compare well. Teale's 'Wandering Through Winter' is broader and more informative, more interesting because it is more interested; Abbey's 'Desert Solitaire' is more personally engaging; Thoreau's 'Walden', Leopold's 'Almanac' or 'Sketches', anything by Muir, Mowat, or Lopez -- more philosophical, more lyrical, more evocative, far better by any standard of measure.Sorry to have to fasten the 'one star' rating here, Mr. Bass, but this book is nothing beyond mediocre."
1,Teenagers write better blogs,"Teenagers write better blogs. And this book is just the author's blog. That's all that this book can aspire to. It's just day in, day out of the author's most inner personal feelings and...but wait...nothing ever happens and the author is as shallow as an elk piss puddle. I read to the part where the author starts to cut wood for the winter. I thought, how boring. So I jumped about 35 pages. Still cutting wood. Jumped again. Still cutting wood.So if you want to watch this guy cut wood, every stinkin' little chip, then this book is for you."
2,Not as good as the others,I did not have any problems whatsoever with the sellers. The product came in like new condition just as advertised. I just didn't care for this recording. I don't think the songs as good as some other Vineyard like Before You Now.
5,Wonderful Book!!!,"This is one of the best books I have ever read.The author is great I have read her other books and they are also cool.This book is about a girl Allie who meets this cool guy on a rest stop on her way to her house from school for the holidays.She later finds out that he and his little brother are going there too.Her popular twin sisters are part of Bens crowd(Ben is the guy she met at the rest stop)because he use to live there but his dad still does.She has set her mind as to not to see Ben in her two week stay but instead see's him almost everywhere she goes school,market,etc. You must read this book if you are in to romance books."
4,AWSOME!,"I thought this was a great book. I like the christmas seting it is a good book for any one who thinks they don't have a chance. -wink,wink- take my advice READ IT!"
5,AT FIRST SIGHT,"I really enjoyed reading this book. I liked how Allie wasn't the ""Gorgeous Blonde"". Although this side of the story was good I also liked what happened with Allie's sister, Julia and Ben's friend."
4,A MUST READ!,"this is a great book. Allie is an athletic, guy-less girl. But once she goes back to her 'home town' she meets Ben and Tim. But Ben's not the only guy who likes her. It's a great, must read book."
5,I LOVED IT!,"this book is great- one of the best Love Stories. it's so sweet, i just really liked the things he said to her, and the way that he treated her. she is so lucky to get a guy like that!"
5,the best,"This was an excellent book! I really enjoyed the characters. It shows you don't have to be ""Miss Popular"" to get the guys. I also love I Do by Elizabeth Chandler. Actually, all books by her are great! I just love the way she always has two love stories in one."
4,Helps with insomnia,"When I first apply to my skin I get sleepy which is great on those occasions when I have trouble falling asleep. However, I still wake up after about 2-4 hours of sleep. I think I'm gonna need extended release melatonin. But I do have to say when I use this my sleep is deeper which is good since I'm a very light sleeper. This does make me sleepy and relaxed. I would have given it 5 stars if it help keep me asleep longer. I'm a 51 year old women in menopause."
3,It is what it is,"Well its melatonin in a pump, cant get wrong there. But does it actually help you sleep?I have rett syndrome and CP and was suggested this by some peopleIt didn't work for me, does it mean it wont work for you... maybe... it might it might not.its a hefty gamble to take. Better off talking to a sleep specialist"
2,I would suggest NOT buying,"Network Cabling Handbook by Chris Clark, this is my opinion: The book does a poor job bringing clarity to the concepts the reader is supposed to be learning. Also, the book has NUMEROUS errors in it. Technical errors/wrong information, spelling errors, switched/incorrect charts and pictures, etc. Example: on page 78 Fig. 3-8. This figure trys to show a TIA/EIA T568B modular outlet configuration, but is is actually T568A. This is just one example of the numerous errors and misinformation I found, and I'm only on Chapter 3! A book with this many errors should have it's own eratta page on the publisher's website. It is a shame that this book is still the primary text used for some beginning Telecommunication and Networking courses."
5,best of aphex twin ever,"wehn i heard this album for the first time, i din,t heard this album was so special. al the tracks has a noisy sound onthe back ground to give the percussion. when you listen to the record a couple of times you can find much more in the songs. a compliment to r d james for the strings the are so beatiful. one bad track on the record and that is ventolin. a bad peep that can be dammage your ears. a must have album."
3,449221.,"Very lukewarm in comparison to the RDJ Album which follows. It has its moments, but ... nothing spectacular. The Ventolin maxi-single is better."
3,Not up to what came before...,"This release is the first full-length followup after the slagging Richard James got from some sectors of the rave scene for his brilliant 'Selected Ambient Works II'. And as such, it feels unfocussed, the tracks often lead nowhere, and a good bit of the atmosphere here is designed (seemingly) to annoy, particularly the high-pitched tone throughout 'Ventolin'. Only 'Icct Hedral' and 'Alberto Balsam' really connected with me; the rest of what's here seems merely tossed together, belying a certain tone of sarcasm and cynicism hiding behind both the album's title and the leering, grinning illo of RDJ on the cover. There's better out there..."
2,ouch,"aphex twin has made some powerfully stupid music. for example this bottom-of-the-barrel release. half of it sounds like a sit-com ""homage"" to wagner's ring cycle, even the beats are mostly dull. ventolin is the best thing here (but note that it IS bone-stripping, as someone put it). you'll find nothing even half as cool as bouncing ball (COME TO DADDY) or yellow calx (RICHARD D. JAMES). buyer beware."
2,this sucked,"this cd was richard d james before he met tom jenkinson, you can really tell. He is constantly looping. not developing tune. doing downbeat electronics. the only thing good about this cd was the bad ass filter on the drums. besides that there really was nothing to it."
4,Sounds and Sounds of Emotion,"I for one, am not a techno fan at all. However I bought this CD because I was just interested I guess...and this is in no way the techno you know of. These are strange sounds that set moods and it's just a total chill CD. Just about anyone can enjoy this CD if they have an open mind. Each song has a different feel. Even if you hate almost all techno like me...check some of this out and there's a good chance you'll like it. It's a great addition to any music fan's collection."
5,beautiful!!,"this is almost classical music! the songs each have an atmosphere all their own. some make you float, die, or fight. this is some of the most intelligent music that i have ever heard. when i ask ask people if they've heard of aphex and they say ""no"", i think thet are stupid. he stretches the limits of what is. this is his best one."
1,Terrible Condition,"This book is NOT in new condition. It was NOT damaged during shipping and not in inappropriate packaging either. This book was damaged before it was ever sent. The cover is dog eared. There is a smudge on the back. The back cover is dirty. The whole book is BENT. The binding is creased in several places! This book is beyond used, it is heavily worn and I was charged the original brand new price which is printed on the back of the book. What a rip-off."
4,interesting,"I found this book most interesting, not only from an architectural point of view, but also for historical information"
5,David Drake shows his talent yet again.,"First, I must admit I really like Mr. Drake's books. Fast paced, just the right amount of character development (not too much, not too little), etc.That said, this Lt. Leary series has turned out to be most pleasant to read. Unlike some, dare I say, ""matured"" authors, Mr. Drake has improved his story telling without deviating from his basic style. Read through the Hammer's Slammers books and and then this series; I think you'll see the increase in expansion of style without going off on some unexpected tangent. I am not saying the two series are closely akin, though.For some reason, I equate the Lt. Leary series to Mr. Weber's Honor Harrington series (and may the the Lt. continue for as many books) and Mrs. Bujold's Vorkosagan Saga. A strange coupling, but there. Good reads all."
4,Another Winner,"David Drake does it again. Another fun, fast paced story that entertains the imagination. Highly recommended."
4,thank goodness,"Thank goodness David Drake returns to his true writing form. The last Lt. Leary book, Far Side of the Stars, was terrible. This book returns to the characters and A REAL PLOT. I enjoyed it and will buy the next, and the next and the next....."
4,Not bad at all.,"This isn't a bad edition to the series, don't get me wrong, its just a little boring is all. No noticeable errors, its just that the plot line is a little bit dry, flat if you will.I found on a whole that all our favorite characters have returned and are acting like we expect them too. There where some new additional characters that give promise, but we'll have to wait for the next book to see if their still around.The plot however could have used some spice and less melodrama. I found that while interesting and entertaining, the characters acted in ways that made them seem two dimensional. This is direction opposite to what the author had been intending, making his hard work go down the drain.On the whole not a bad book in the series. Just not the crowned jewel."
4,Very good,"Product was delivered as promised. The seeds germinated and are growing. One of my cats has eaten some, the other cat and the dog won't touch it. Interestingly, the car that eats it is the only cat that never goes outside."
5,My cat's favorite plant!,"I wanted a cat friendly garden on my rooftop deck for me and my cat. I planted this in a pot. I have this, catnip, catmint, mint, and many others. This is her favorite! She munches on it a little every day during the warm months. There were enough seeds that I am able to replant any areas she pulled out, and it has lasted several years. Misty the cat loves it!"
3,CatNip for Kitty,Unfortunately when the product arrived the bag had a hole in it and was not in the best of shape. With that being said I still tried the product. I planted the seeds and they grew and My cat ate it but I dont feel that he likes this product as much. His enthusiasm isnt there like it was with other brand
2,Cats not interested,"I planted them, the grassy plants grew well. Lots of healthy plants....only my cats showed absolutely no interest in them!"
3,Promissing,"It is interesting, beautifully concepts are explained but then you start to notice a regurgitation over and over again same concepts gets re explained over and over again in different forms. However concept of change of reality and affecting it by thought is fascinating."
4,Apache Rock,"This movie had gotten some poor reviews and Hudson himself wasn't happy with his performance in it, so I had hesitated to order it. But I had enjoyed Jeff Chandler as Cochise in ""Broken Arrow"" (Chandler appears in a cameo appearance in Cochise's death scene at the start of the film), and as a Hudson fan I wanted to see if ""Taza"" was as bad as it was made out to be. I was pleasantly surprised. It held my attention -- and I've seen a lot worse movies! The story wasn't the hackneyed white man good/red man bad, and I found Hudson believable in the role. I think Hudson fans will be satisfied with this movie, even if Hudson himself wasn't."
2,not good!!!,"i got the lexmark x75 and i want to tell that there is a big paper feeding problem with this printer. i put the paper and it goes in crooked and to top it off it jams and eats the paper.i originally thought the type of paper was too thick, but that wasn't the case. i really don't have an issue as far the ink is concerned, but this printer was made really bad!!it tells you not to feed the paper all the way and that is not the case. i can't even put three sheets because it will all go into the printer at the same time!! my advice is.. if u got it---TAKE IT BACK!!! NOT WORTH IT!!"
2,"eh, its ok","I got my printer from dell. the first one we got was defective. the lights wouldn't come on and the buttons didn't work so they sent us another one. I wouldn't print photos to hang on the walls, but the scanner works fairly well. My main problem with it is the paper feed. mine ALWAYS gets jammed when I put in new paper. I don't know why. I think you get what you pay for. and we paid too much for ours."
4,Good all-in-one,"The Lexmark X75 is an excellent deal for the price. The software is fool proof, very easy to scan, copy, and print, even if you've never done it before. Printer quality is great. Scanner can scan at quite high resolutions (up to 9600 dpi). The highest resolution I've scanned at is 600 dpi and it looks great. Haven't used the copier much, but it also does a decent job. Size is great as well; doesn't take up too much space. The only problems I can think of are that the ink cartridges only hold about 20 ml of ink...it prints quite slow in color, and does not come with a USB cable (have to purchase separately). Overall it's a great printer, but don't think you're paying a rock-bottom price, because you'll pay for it in the end with the printer cartridges."
3,Diehard Lexmark fan,"I am a diehard lexmark fan. I will not buy anything else. This is the worst lexmark I have owned. The software will not install on my Windows XP laptop. I finally got it working on my Macs. It scans great! It prints only ""ok"". The ""photo quality"" prints are downright horrible. I have 4 Lexmark printers and this is the ONLY negative experience I have had with any of them."
1,Worst Printer Ever!!!,"I've owned this computer for less than 8 months and now my black ink will not print. It only prints color and only specific colors. I'ved had to reinstall the printer hardware more times than I can count. I recommend that you do not get this printer. It will work really great when you first get it, but then that goes out the window and that's where I threw mine. This printer is so bad it doesn't deserve one star."
3,Size n Price of X75M,"I just bought an X75M and it was the price of a color ink refill ($35.00.) However, what will I do when I need to buy a new refill? The black is ~$30.00 and the color is ~35.00. Much cheaper to trash the printer and buy a new one with new ink. The size of the ink containers is soooooooooooo smallllll! Plus, just found out that Lexmark uses some kind of sensor to ensure that you cannot refill their ink using a refill kit. Even when I refilled my cartraige, it would not print at all. Tried it on my Z43 and it will not work. Talked to various people who are incountering the same problem. That is maybe why Lexmark sells their printers cheaper, hoping to make the money on the ink cartriages."
1,You get what you pay for!,"I had previously owned a Lexmark 3200 which lasted me for five years until it started jamming almost all the time. It was just getting old and I definitely got my money's worth. This thing, however, is another story. The paper jams very easily and this thing is slower than any printer I've ever used. Don't believe the ratings for the speed. It is SLOW... The only time it's not slow is if you have it on the LOWEST RESOLUTION with BLACK AND WHITE only. Then it looks...[bad] anyway. Other than these minor difficulties, this thing is worth the money."
3,PrinTrio X75,I like the flatbed design. The faxing could be better. For the money I should of waited and shopped around a little better. I like the printing and scanning. To get a cartridge for the printer is a different story all together.
4,Not to bad,"This is action all the way, and spends very little time in between. Well read by the narrator. Excellent for listening to in the car on a journey, or going to work. this is book 1 in a 3 book/audio series.If you want a good action story then this audio book is a good place to start."
2,"Great lyrics, unoriginal/recycled beats","(k--ks--k----s----) That is the kick-snare pattern used repeatedly throughout this album (or some variation thereof). I'm a big fan of the lyrical style, the stream of conciousness styling utilized by Rob Sonic (and other Definitive Jux labelmate Aesop Rock), but repeated listenings to the album grow weary once you start realizing that pattern is rehashed and recycled for 9 of the 11 songs on the album."
5,a good book for teaching and understanding,My student are feeling good for reading book and solving some of problem.But som of this are difficult for them. I teach discrete and contineous R.V (PDF and DF)with other. I add the subject of ATOMS and simplify the part of counting.
2,Better Luck Next Time,"I entered a junior level probability course with an open mind because of the many applications of probability distributions to chemistry and physics. However, after taking the probability course and using this book, I have grown to seriously dislike the topic. I was not impressed with this book at all. I agree with others that the explanations and theory presented in the text do not provide enough information to complete the Theoretical Exercises at the end of each chapter. I think the course could have been every interesting and enlighting had it not been for this book."
2,It's so-so,"The book writes a paragraph of theorectical explanations and then dives into a plethora of examples. The examples are good, but learning by example doesn't alway cut it."
4,well-developed,"My first reaction to this book was that the problems were very, very difficult to solve, and I believed that it was mainly do to the author's fault of not presenting effective methods for handling the problems in a step by step manner. However, I now believe that after reading more texts on the subject, that introductory level probability problems, in general, require a greater deal of mathematical reasoning and careful application of the rules of probability than do other introductory problems in the realms of calculus and physics where the problems are of a 'plug-in' nature. So in defense of Dr. Ross, I must say that his text is well thought out with interesting, careful examples and written concisely and fluently (if at times somewhat condescending on the reader)."
1,This book is not a good learning tool,"Ross uses awkward notation and gives too many non-relevant examples. The problems are plentiful, but he doesn't give the reader a feel that the tools of probabilty are very practical in nature. He comes across as though mathematics were just an idle exercise for a bored intellectual. He could do much better in his explanations in a revision."
2,Not up to par,"Not one of Junior's better albums unfortunately. Not enough real blues essence and too many funky rhythms. The guest artists don't espeically help, they seem to be just going through the motions. Come On This House, also on TELARC, is infinitely better - now that one's the real deal."
5,Who knew?,"I'm honestly not sure when or how it happened, but this has become one of my favorite albums. It falls somewhere between music to LISTEN to and music to HAVE ON when you're doing other stuff. It works for both scenarios. Very well.All in all it's a gem that somehow managed to slip under the radar. BUY THIS .. it's only $2.50 after shipping anyway. TOTALLY worth it. I'm tempted to buy another copy because the one I have is pretty messed up."
4,U of A South Elem. Education Student,"I thought that the book was very cute. The kids that I read it to enjoyed it as well. I liked that it dealt with fractions in a funny way that made it easier for kids to understand. Fractions are not the most fun math in the world, but this book made it a lot more fun and intertesting for kids. I would recommend this book to anyone who has kids or is a teacher."
3,"Fine, but there are better resources out there","On the plus side: This book is printed in an easel-like format so you can prop it up on a table beside you.That being said, sign language is very fluid and still pictures can't really show you all the motions involved in making a sign. There are many FREE resources on the web that will teach you a greater sign language vocabulary, and some have video so you can see the actual motions as they are made.This book is really better for someone who only wants to teach their baby some words in sign language rather than someone looking to teach their child to communicate."
3,Certainly worth the money,"Not really sure if this book is worthwhile, I think that being an attentive parent is worth much more than sign language.If you want to give it a try though, this book does have enough info to get you going and it is very low-priced."
5,Good starting point,"I like this book because it is a simple way to get started. I buy it as a gift for new parents because not all parents will give it 100% especially if the book, like many, is wordy. The layout is nice and there are suggestions for taking it further as well as good ways to implement the signs into context that will give meaning to the child. It gives some essential signs as well as signs of things that kids often comment on (several animal signs are given because kids usually comment on animated objects before they will comment on inanimate objects). I think for those parents who are able to implement these signs into everyday life there are many books out there that can expand on these signs. The authors even give recommendations for other resources to seek out. For those parents who aren't as willing to implement sign language into everyday life I think this book is less intense which makes it more likely that they will use some of the signs."
3,Ok but a little short,This thing works. Their choice of how it attaches to the Gecko is a little clunky. It makes use of a locking/push-button similar to a belt clip. This pushes the center of gravity out and causes it to hang a little funny. My biggest complaint is how short the cord is. Its almost too short to see your GPS but not quite.Improvements:1) They need to find a better means to hang the unit so it truly pendulums.2) Add a few inches to the lenght of the cord!Worth it? Sort of.
5,Lanyard,"It is a nice item, but the clip locks up with the dirt or the use after a while. I have to make sure I always tighten up the fastener for Rino or it will come unloose and you could lose it if you are the move. Other than it's okay."
5,A Phish Phan's Dream,"This is without a doubt Phish's best album for a true Phish Phanatic. However, a new Phish Phan or someone just checking Phish out for the Phirst time should be advised to buy an album with less long jams like Stash (12:31) and YEM (20:57) and more of Phish's short, catchy songs such as Fee and Golgi Apparatus. I repeat: THIS IS A MUST-HAVE FOR ANY TRUE PHISH PHAN!!!"
3,It was okay....,"When I ordered the set, I thought It would be in better shape. The set came in what I'd call ""good"" condition, but It was the cd's I was looking for."
5,"Oh, what a beautiful buzz! What a beautiful buzz!","A Live One remains one of Phish's finest simply because it is live. The album is the answer to the question, what is a Phish show like? And remains a way for those of us road warriors to remember how great it is. For those of you looking for short radio friendly pop tunes, this album is not for you. It is, however, a lesson in improvisational music and showcases Phish's remarkable ability to listen to each other. Listen, for example, to Stash or Harry hood, and even the infamous thirty minute Tweezer. The interplay between these four fine musicians is remarkable. This is a must own in any respectable Phish fan's collection."
5,Phish is a band that is meant to be heard live,"Nothing can capture the feeling of being at a live Phish show, but this album is as close as you can get. The song selection is good, ranging from short songs to half-hour jams. Of all of Phish's disks, this one shows off thier musicianship better than any other. Fortunatly, Page's keyboards are easier to pick out than some of their studio stuff. If you are a Phish fan, this disk is a must."
5,profound music.,"This was the first live Phish I had ever heard. Before this was all of the studio albums, which are all brilliant, but when it comes to REALLY good Phish, this is the turning point. This band is genius and A Live One proves it. One thing about ""Tweezer."" I am a person who can hang with 30-minute jams, and this song was more than an amazing version. If you just can't hang with them, this is the only track I would suggest skipping. The 20-minute ""You Enjoy Myself"" is superb, taking you to other demensions with their jams and showing you what a good live band is. After you finish the song, you don't even realize that almost half an hour has passed you by. Those are my personal favorite two, but the rest of the album is a journey. Go with it.I recommend this album for anyone who enjoys good music as much as I do."
5,Don't buy this CD is you don't like long jams,"So many people have complained about the length of the songs on this CD, but that's probably because they're not die-hard jam band fans. The jams compiled (and this is a compilation) on this CD are great! I love the vocal jam at the end of YEM. Great version of Simple. And yes, you have to love Tweezer. I've been to lots of shows...never truly appreciated the jams (though I always loved them) till I saw them live...you can't catch that exhileration in a recording! This is a great recording. Just don't buy it with the expectation for a sing-along CD with lots of lyrics. If you like Phish's sound, but don't like jams, buy Hoist or Billy Breathes."
3,A live recording of a mediocre Phish show,"This CD is a good introduction into the world of live Phish, but it definitely is not considered one of Phish's best shows. Tweezer is almost 30 minutes long, fun at a show but kind of an overkill on CD. If you are looking to get your first taste of Phish, I recommend Rift or Slip, Stitch and Pass."
2,does not meet the hype at all,"this album is so overwrouught with pretense, it is ridiculous. the jams are lame and never really hit that laser apex i used to know. the tweezer is self indulgent and this time it is a bad thing. kudos to the harry hood, but even this one comes up short. stick to junta and lawn boy, albums the boys produced and when they were younger and more open and more daring and not nearly as complacent."
3,Good but not great...,"I bought this after reading in many, many interviews and articles that this was a band I couldn't miss. I reviewed a bunch of cd's on Amazon until I picked this one because it contianed the most variety of their music and came recommended.I'm not going to say it is my favorite disc, but it is good. My problem is that they don't know what they want to be. Progressive Rock band? Pop band? Jazz Fusion? They do too much soloing and free-form for progressive rock, to much instrumentation to be a pop band and not enough virtuosity to be a jazz band. Just because a song is 30 minutes doesn't mean its a prog rock song.They sound like a combination of Gentle Giant, the Greatful Dead, and Dave Matthews... all great bands, but in this case the sum of the parts is not equal to the whole.So if you like long solos/jams with catchy pop-like structure, you'll probably enjoy this. If you're a hardcore progressive rock fan, I would probably pass."
4,The way they're meant to be heard.,"I gotta say, I do love the studio albums quite a bit, but this is THE ""Phish"" album to get. Being live does make it better. Disc one starts with the pop fave ""Bouncing Around The Room"", and is a great version of that song. ""Gumbo"", ""You Enjoy Myself"", and ""Chalkdust Torture"" are all excellent. The way ""Wilson"" starts out on disc two with the crowd chanting is awesome. The songs on the second disc are as long as they are good, with the catchy ""Simple"" being a nice break. I wish something was on here from ""Rift"", but with the good booklet, and all the great music, you can't complain about catching ""A Live One""."
5,phishs best,"this is phish's masterpiece, every song is tight, not a flaw in the whole album. after hearing this your musical appreciation will grow by leaps and bounds. the best songs are wilson, you enjoy myself and bouncing around the room. if you love phish get this album"
4,Heady Nugs,This is a great album for a beginer or a collector. Page picked a few jems of days gone by for this album. Its hard to find a show with such a good sound and mix. The versions of the songs included are hard to beat. Excelent
4,Musical experimentation not recommended for beginners...,"If you're a veteran Phish fan, then you must own this cd. However, if you're just starting out may I suggest purchasing the band's first live effort ""Slip, Stitch and Pass."" The jams are tighter with less ""noodling"" which may turn off the novice Phish listener. ""A Live One"" is a great representation of a Phish show, but if I had to choose just one it would be ""Slip, Stitch and Pass."""
4,It had me Bouncing Roung the Room!,"I am a huge phish fan, and if you are too, it's a must. i love the improv and the way the audience reacts. if you've never been to a phish concert, this is just a very small glimpse at the energy and craziness that a phish show has. This is definately one of their best."
4,Good for new phans,"pretty good songs despite the ever rookie song Bouncin round the room, but an ok set-list for the show. Live shows are the best to hear, but only if they're good ones. I still recomend listening to bootlegs but if you want a CD this is a good choice."
5,Phish's Phinest,"I was raised on the music of the grateful dead and Phish. I was actually born the same year that Phish was. While all of my preschool friends were listening to Raffi, I stood out with Jerry Garcia and David Grisman's Not For Kids Only cd in my boombox. Anywho, this is my favorite Phish cd ever. I'd have to say that it is even better than most bootlegs (not just in sound quality.) But if you have never seen them live, that's definately the best and only way to truly experience Phish. So just get the cd. I promise that you won't be sorry. Then go and get Phish tickets. Oh yeah- I still think that Bouncin' kicks!"
5,A great eye opener for new fans,"All in all a good(ie great)album for new fans who don't necessarily have access to the tapes that these were culled from. I'd have to say the Great Woods Stash that appears on this is about as good as Stashes go. I was a bit let down(when it happened, I've had four years to get over it) by the Chalkdust and Bouncin' selections. One is a bad version and the other one never changes anyway. The lack of an Antelope or Reba is also a big loss. Pay no mind to the Tweezer haters below, this is a great one(Not to mention famous, it was the one from Bangor, ME). It does breakdown to its bare bones, though, resembling industrial rock at times. The Montana is okay. It's culled from the Bozeman, MT Tweezer, one of the most famous in Phish history. I was hoping that would be the one they'd put in in its entirety but no dice. Get this album, it's a pretty hot one."
4,The way Phish is supposed to be listened too... it's great..,"The double-live-album starts out with the frenetic, jumpy, ""Bouncing Around the Room"". The crowd goes mad, and then the boys go completely out to space with a 13-minute version of ""Stash"" that reaches new, explosive aural heights, with the electric guitar battling the preposterous piano to a brilliant finale. Phish is at their best when they let themselves go like this- you can hear just how talented they are. People say they are the new incarnation of The Dead, but here they are in better form than The Dead ever were."
5,Awesome,"Well i gotta say, this is like the best phish purchase i've ever made. Most songs are amazing jams with crazy solos my trey that just blow your mind. The quality is pretty dang good, except for while my guitar gently weeps, there's something weird with the quality on that one. The only real problem i have with this is tweezer, it's 30 minutes long, most people would think ""Wow, thirty minutes of tweezer?! How can that be bad."" well for half of it it's random noises that might be cool at the concert, but just get annoying after a while on disc. I feel it's a waste of disc space, just look at tweezer on live phish 19, it's 10:30, and sounds much better than this one. Well even with tweezer i give it 5 stars, because all the other songs are so good and well performed."
1,The most pathetic excuse for a BOOK,"This book is totally hopeless. It's almost as if the authors wrote this with the itention of confusing the students and making Operations Management totally inaccesible to them. A hillbilly professor called Dr Whittenberg, the bigesst hick on Earth, teaches this book at my college [the University of Texas] and just as hopeless as he is, so is the book. They pruposely put such books so students cannot study on their own and are forced to come to the instructor's office where they will shout at them. This book was a waste of the 100-something bucks I spent on it!"
1,Not about defining overall communications objectives,"I bought this article to help clarify an approach to improving overall internal company communications. If this is your goal, this is not a useful resource. It is about improving upon a the content and delivery of a presentation to an audience.Amazon should provide a better summary of the article before offering it for sale."
5,Great Read!,"This is an outstanding account of Joan's start in show business. It gave a clear view of the behind the scenes operations of the ""hard knocks"" of show business.A wonderful book about Mrs. Rivers and her climb to the top."
5,Thank-you Joan - I feel like I know you!!!,"I love the way Joan wrote this book - I couldn't put it down until I was finished!!!! My spouse of 45 years died 3 years ago and it felt like my life hit a brick wall doing about 200mph. Everything about Joan's story is written in a candid, honest, credible way. I last saw her on ""Celebrity Apprentice"" and came away feeling that I got a glimpse into the Real person that she is, separated from the entertainer. I liked what I discovered. I have underlined many passages in this book to personalize and insert into my Journal. Whatever ""Goodness of Life"" Joan Rivers is experiencing, ...she deserves it!!"
4,What a voice!,"I passed on this years ago when I was back in University, then time passed & I forgot about this album. So glad I got to find a copy again. Guy's got a sick voice and amazing range, shame he never blew up! Best track on the album is ""Whatever You Need"" which was a single & most of the album (minus 1 or 2 tracks) is good."
1,Could have found the same quality bracelet at a flea market a lot cheaper.,"The bracelet looks cheap and netaya sent it in a bubble wrap envelope with no support, so it was warped and bent when it arrived. I used to think that amazon cared about the quality of the products they have on there web site, so i did'nt check netaya's feedback, i wish i would have. This company is a joke and i guess i can't trust amazon to market quality products either."
4,Good Value,"This isn't the fanciest bag on the market but a very handy bag for quick trips to the gym. It is a no-nonsense bag with a little style and for the price, it's a good buy. Maybe even a good buy as a nice bag for a young soccer player."
4,satisfecha,"bello satisfecha con el o y el tiempo en recibirlo. buena atención por parte del vendedor, espero volver a comprar"
5,Cuban a capella -- caliente y picante!,"This a capella group (Vocal Sampling) out of Cuba first came to my attention when the United States (shamefully) would not grant them a visa to come and accept a Grammy for their album. Politics has no place in the arts!These guys are amazing (think of Take 6 or other male a capella groups). The songs are beautiful and haunting. The rhythms are, well, Cuban :-). Put it together and there you go!"
1,Leaky Leaky Leaky,I wasn't expecting much...as is this item is so cheap & I'm not sure if it was damaged during shipping but my bird feeder leaked everywhere the first time I tried to fill it up. :(I've since returned it and bought a glass one from a local store.
4,Conveys the true spirit of the season,"This is the first CD of Sarah's I've purchased, and I'm impressed with her voice as well as with her interpretation of the songs on this album. She shows some creativity with the melodies that I mostly found refreshing, particularly with ""What Child is This?"", which is my favorite track on the disc.Joni Mitchell's ""River"" and Gordon Lightfoot's ""Song for a Winter's Night"" were welcome additions to my ears, and brought a touch of nostalgia to this 50-something reviewer's heart.Overall I found that the songs convey the wonder, the peace and the simplicity that are a powerful reminder of the true Christmas spirit. This album serves as a prophetic voice in the midst of the busyness, noise and commercialism that are hard to escape this time of the year."
5,I dont even like Christmas music...,"I've loved Sarah since I first heard ""Sweet Surrender"" for the first time. Then I went out and bought her older stuff as well as new. I dont even listen to Christmas music, but Sarah turns it into something else, into her. Its so beautiful, especially the title track. I would suggest everyone get this album, I dont think Sarah could ever dissapoint me. I mean I get irritated that she takes so long to do albums, but they are so worth the wait, dont wait to get this one."
5,The Must Have Christmas CD!,"In typical Sarah style, this cd is a moving Christmas journey. Her voice is the most beautiful instrument. She never disappoints, except when the cd is over, leaving you yearning for more. Hard to pick a favorite, but I'd have to say it would be The First Noel/Mary Mary, astounding. This is the cd I'll be trimming my tree to!"
4,Not a bad CD,"This is not Sarah McLachlan's best album, and it is not the best Christmas album either, but it is pleasant listening. Some of the song choices are a little bit strange, but she manages to bring them together with solid vocals. That being said, I would probably opt to purchase the downloads for the songs I like rather than buying the entire album."
5,"Love it, love it, love it...","To be completely honest, I am not Sarah McLachlan's biggest fan; as a matter of fact, I don't believe I've ever purchased a CD of her's before. Yes, I've enjoyed a few of the songs she has released, but never felt the need to buy UNTIL NOW! I accidently found Wintersong while browsing through a music service I subscribe to...I wanted something NEW, something refreshing for Christmas this year. And, WOW, did I find it.In the week that I have owned it, I have played it close to twenty times...I love the traditional songs (which are rearranged to NOT sound traditional)...her rendition of Silent Night and Greensleves are gorgeous! I love the not-so-traditional songs...simply put, I LOVE the album.I highly recommend it, and have bought this CD as a gift for family because it's THAT good."
2,Silent Blight,"I'd be irate if I would only stay awake long enough to notice. Stupefyingly devoid of any emotion other than monotony, her withered gossamer tones mewl standard holiday fare no better or worse than the lead in the Macy's Christmas Choir, with longtime McLachlan menace Pierre Marchand on board to helm this snoozefest with his usual flair for over-saturation. They're all here, from the traditionalist `The First Noel' and `Oh Little Town Of Bethlehem' and, of course, `Silent Night', to her sucking the joy right out of `Christmas Time Is Here' to the umpteenth remakes of `River' and `Happy Xmas [War Is Over]' the latter two reaching new heights [lows] of languidness. The real clinker is the self-penned `Wintersong', her seasonal contribution I am steadfast her rabid fan base will swallow like Christmas pudding. Oh, yeah - downgraded for employing the over-rated Diana Krall on a cut. The cover art is pretty, though. My grade: C-"
5,EXCELLENT CD......,"I love this CD....I recommend it to EVERYONE!!!! The only thing I was upset about is that I ordered enough to get free shipping and of course wanted to take advantage of that; however, Amazon says that if I have all my items shipped together they will not be arrive in time for Christmas. So, I pay for shipping and they ship my items separately, I get them within 2 days of each other and pay almost 20 bucks for shipping.....bummer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,X mas song,"Heard and saw her do ""Silent Night,Holy Night"" live on TV- it was magificant,so I got the album. It is the best of all the tracks."
4,Fresh Sound,"Sarah McLachlan is new to me and I found her rendition of both new and old Christmas songs very appealing. At times her use of a falsetto glide is disturbing but, overall, this is a very good addition to any collection."
4,"Best Version Of ""River""","This recording is not the greatest Christmas CD you will ever find, but it does contain the best version of the song ""River"" that I have ever heard; even better than the original."
5,Unique and Satisfying,"Not just another proverbial ""pop star gone Christmas"" album! Absolutely beautiful and elegant! Soothing and captures the serenity of the season. I can see enjoying this for years to come and will not shove it to the back of my collection or resell it on Amazon marketplace! Her ethereal voice does absolute justice to these beautiful holiday classics!"
2,Not at all what I expected,"I would like to start out saying that I'm a huge Sarah McLachlan fan. My wife bought this for me for Christmas as a surprise. I wanted to love the album but I just couldn't. As beautiful as Sarah's voice is, and as much as I love her style of singing, it just didn't work for me with Christmas songs. Most of the tracks sound the same and are delivered in such a somber tone that it just doesn't feel like Christmas music. In my opinion this just doesn't live up to the quality of her work. I would borrow the CD from your local library to preview it before buying it just to make sure it is your cup of tea."
4,Beautifully done!,"I love this album- it's got great songs, done wonderfully well.Her version of ""River""- the Joni Mitchell song- is gorgeous."
4,Wonderful Christmas album,"I love Sarah's voice, its so soothing and different from half the artists out there. Her version of 'Have yourself a merry little Christmas' is my favorite track, Its sooo pretty and different from all the other versions out there. That is pretty much the only reason I bought this album, just after hearing that one song. And I'm happy to report I loved the rest of the album as well."
4,Christmas in September,"I have been a Sarah McLachlan for over a decade now beginning with her first albumTouch. I have always loved her gentle vocals and introspective lyrics. I recently got around to hearing her Christmas albumWintersong. While I do like the cd a lot, I have to admit I had to listen to it a few times to get used to Sarah's take on songs like ""What Child is This?"" and ""The First Noel/Mary Mary"". Initially I wasn't really wild about the melodies to those songs but after several listens, I grew to love them. My favorite track has to be Sarah's haunting cover of John Lennon's ""Happy Xmas (War is Over)"". I always loved the music and the lyrics. Sarah's gentle vocals compliments the song very well. I also enjoyed the new tracks ""River"" and ""Wintersong"". Even though WINTERSONG is a Christmas album, I do like listening to it after work. I find the music very soothing to listen to. This album is a must have for Sarah fans I think."
2,Sarah McLachlan,This is a high quality CD. This lady has such a beautiful voice. I recomend her to all
3,This is a Christmas CD,"Okay it should have been obvious had I bothered to look at the song list. I didn't since I was thrilled to see the long awaited and much anticipated new Sarah McLachlin CD.My mistake. Don't make the same mistake. There are a few songs that make the CD worthwhile, Song for a Winter Night (from 1994), Wintersong and Christmas Time is Here, but generally there is not much to recommend this CD.Back to waiting and anticipating."
4,Only 4 Stars because Diana Krall Doesn't sing,"Great CD. However, I can only give it 4 stars as Diana Krall doesn't sing on the final track only plays the piano."
5,Best gift I have received in years,"I'm a long time fan, and while I was skeptical of another ""same old"" Christmas CD, this is the most refreshing CD I have heard in years. Her renditions are fresh and heart touching. They strike chords in my heart that have not been touched by the spirit in years. It seeks out the joy and peace that belongs in the season. It makes us aware of the pain and the joy in the life of Christ. There are sad and joyous times at the Christmas season for each of us. It will touch your soul with the sadness we feel for those we have loved and lost and the happiness of spending time with the dear loved ones we still have among us. It made me melancholy, sad, spiritual, thankful and filled with peace.Thanks Sarah, for the awakening!"
4,Love the music,"She sings beautifully and for my first Sarah I love it Peaceful, calm and beautiful words and music"
5,Ethereal and haunting: classic Sarah,"While my husband finds Sarah's McLachlan's voice beautiful yet ""depressing"", I find her naturally ethereal and haunting voice to add a sacredness to these Christmas songs that is often neglected in the wake of the boisterousness and frivolity of the season. It is music to reflect by and will impress you with a sense of the deeper spirituality of the season and perhaps even illuminate the beauty of winter."
2,Wintersong,I love Sarah & Christmas music so I thought this would be wonderful. But it was very depressing. Songs were slow and sad. Not what I had expected at all.
5,Sara Mclachlan CD Review,"Probably my best Christmas CD out of fairly large collection that includes Nat King Cole, Bing Crosby, Ann Murray, etc. Sara Mclachlan's choice of songs really compliments her incredibly stunning voice."
4,Great voice!,"Sarah sounds great on this CD.I just wish she had done more songs with more of a gospel feel.I just love her voice so much I wanted MORE!This CD is a GREAT addition to your holiday music collection.ANd when it comes to Sarah, how can you go wrong?You can't!I am sure you will be satisfied."
3,Won't get you in the Christmas spirit,"I am a fan of Sarah McLachlan. For a Christmas CD, however, this one is a downer. The whole feel of the CD is very understated, too understated for my liking. The title song, ""Wintersong,"" is good, and I really like her interpretation of ""Christmas Time is Here."" I also like her interpretation of Joni Mitchell's song, ""River."" However, even though Christmas is mentioned in that song, it seems to me to be too depressing a choice for a Christmas CD. Overall, ""Wintersong"" is not a bad CD, it's certainly different than most Christmas CD's, but it won't get you in the Christmas spirit."
4,A good addition,"This cd does not stray from her usual sound. Her voice is beautiful as always. However, for a Christmas album, it's a little lacking in holiday cheer for my taste. It's lovely. It's a great addition to a solid Christmas album rotation, but if I could only have two or three Christmas cds, this would not be one of them. But I'm not limited to 2 or 3 :) So I'm quite happy to have and play this."
4,nice and relaxing,I liked this CD a lot. It is typical Sarah McLachlan but I wanted that so I was happy with the purchase. It was a great price and I really liked her version of christmastime is here. The River always makes me wanna cry. overall a good addition to my holiday CD collection.
4,Melancholy Christmas,"Sarah has one of the most insightful and beautiful voices, making her selections quite apporpriate for her very distinct voice. For someone who is in the not-so-jolly-holly Chrsitmas mood, who is looking for songs that convey some understanding of their multi-dimenstional feelings, the CD is perfect. Sarah's ""Wintersong"" will be a classic in years to come."
4,Beautiful Christmas music,I was pleasantly surprised how much I loved this CD. I was also happy she covered some christian Christmas songs that I love. Her beautiful voice does not disappoint and it is a must have for your Christmas collection.
5,One of the best Christmas albums ever!,I bought multiple copies of this and gave it to those who I love the most. It is a beautiful album that touches my soul.
5,sarah mc wintersong,great sound quality. the price was nice. the songs are great. if you like sarah and xmas buy this cd.
4,Another beautiful album from Sarah McLachlan,"I'm not the biggest fan of Sarah's ""First Noel/Mary, Mary,"" but I like every other song on this album. Sarah's voice is gorgeous, and she has an absolutely gorgeous version of ""What Child Is This."" Also, ""River"" and ""Wintersong"" are both amazing. Buy this. You won't be disappointed."
3,Don't listen if you're feeling sad,"Very pretty, atmospheric tunes, but I wouldn't recommend if you're feeling down. It'll just depress you even more. Too melancholy if you're prone to winter blues. Otherwise, listen up and enjoy. Lovely for background music while wrapping gifts or hosting a small, mellow party."
4,Wonderful,"It's not only very earthy sounding, she gives a wonderful rendition to Joni Mitchell's River. Best holiday CD I've ever owned!"
5,A Lovely Christmas,I ususally buy at least one new Christmas album each holiday season. Sarah's voice is crystal clear and lends itself beautifully to Christmas music. I cannot wait until next Christmas to listen to it again!
2,Buy something else,Some of her arrangements on the traditional songs are just plain weird. And the pace is so slooooooow. I should have passed.
2,NO GO FOR ME,I was a little dissappointed in the CD. I love SM but this left me unmoved and I gave it away. I was surprised myself that disliked it so much. The music was just so bland and lifeless. So unlike her other albums.
2,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed in this CD. I am fan of Sarah McLachlan and was so excited to find that she recorded a Christmas CD. I was completely prepared to love it. I was sadly diappointed to find that, with the exception of 2 or 3 songs, this did not feel like a labor of love. She has an amazing voice but instead of using it with all the passion she usually gives, it felt like she was just going through the motions."
1,Such a downer!,"I love Sarah McLachlan, but I expect something joyous and inspirational for Christmas. This album was such a downer! Her voice is still beautiful, but the songs came out so melancholy they are depressing."
2,peel doesn't fit in it well,"GREAT CONCEPT, but.....I've got the regular sized aluminum pizza peel with the shorter wooden handle. It does not rest snugly into the bracket holder, like one might think. I have to lean the peel kinda to the side or either rest the far end against the wall with the handle end pulled out a little. But I'm making it work,so it's usable.Picture looks bronzish--it's totally shiny/silver/chrome color."
5,Cuba Mia - The Raw Sentiments of Cubans in Exile,"This book is about all I have ever wanted to express about my Cuban-American life. Every single sentiment one feels about being in exile, loving the American way of life, but missing our motherland daily and never forgetting where one comes from."
4,Great inexpensive uke,"I brought a guitar to play at a recent family gathering. I also brought my ukulele just to play around with myself. People usually like acoustic guitars, but they went nuts over my uke. All the kids and young adults took turns playing it. I decided to gift one of the young adults with the OU3. I ordered it from Amazon. It is a great uke, a little above the beginner level but still very affordable at under $100. The intoneation is very good. I have looked at cheap ukes that sound Ok, but you can't tune them. This one is pretty with its glossy finish, has very good action, sounds good, and I think it was a great choice."
5,So funny,"If you have seen Sebastian Maniscalco before, you know his patented hilarious pitch perfect delivery and unique voice. This special does not disappoint! I love the physicality of his humor, and I think I watched his bit on incorporating Michael Jackson dance moves into everyday conversations about 15x because I laughed so hard."
5,Outstanding Comedy,"If you are looking for a very good laugh with a clean presentation, this is it . I hope Sebastian, keeps the next performance at this level. If there was 5+ in stars this is it. My God was this funny. I ""strongly"" suggest you get the word out on Sebastian. HBO & SHOWTIME do you hear me. I have watched other commedians and they have to use much of the ""F"" word and they need it to make their point for a laugh . Not really needed with Sebastian comedy -maybe used it one time, but innocent enough that it fit right in with the presentation, and not really part of this DVD performance.I loved ""What's Wrong With People"" --and I this is one you can guarantee not to be disappointed. Spend the money watch it --laugh--- and when you down and out and you need a pick me up --watch it again."
5,Sebastian has the gift!,"Sebastian Maniscalco has the gift! Echoing some of the other reviews here, he truly makes you laugh! You can relate to his stories and how funny we must have been to others back in the day! Bravo Mr Maniscalco, Bravo!"
5,putting it all together,"The other review of this book has missed the point entirely. Since George Stevens lived his life in film, the continuous comparison between what he lived and what he put on screen is completely valid. Kudos to Ms. Moss for being intelligent enough to make these kinds of connections. This is an insightful, well-written, well-thought out book that explores the life and work of a great film maker thoroughly. If you have any interest in George Stevens or Hollywood of this time, then you will find this book a great read."
2,Not quite the record it should've been.,"This was Tina's first album for a major label. It's a text book case of what can go wrong when a new act is signed, a big budget is applied and there is hardly a decent song in sight. New material was in short supply, so two songs from her first indie album reappears here. Tina's strength up to the present moment has always been in the capacity of singer and performer; very old school with tons of audience interaction and sweat. See her in a small out of the way venue if you can. She has as of this year been released from her contract with Sire Records and the future of the band looks uncertain. I believe that her best work as a recording artist is yet to come if she can write or find the right songs to record. She's a rock & roll singer in need of rock & roll songs. She's one of a kind and I wish her all the best for the future."
4,Just another great one! :o),"In this album, Zeca Baleiro lets everybody confused about his music. Totally different of the two (even) dancing disks, Baleiro comes with acoustic tracks in this disk, and a brazilian surf music / rock band (Charlie Brown Jr) cover - Proibida pra Mim, getting to the music as another harmony and appearance.We can see another great songs in this, like the loneliness song, ""Blues do Elevador""; but Baleiro had better days.Baleiro finds another texture in his music, a great disk, but too far away from the others."
2,MEDIOCRE AS USUAL!!!!,"These 3 men are brilliant together and apart but in terms of ""Body & Soul""cds they tend to suck!!!! TOO ECLECTIC and ORGANIC!!! NOT ENOUGH HARDCORE BEATS WITH SMASHING VOCALS!!!!And YES I know what I'm talking about because I cut my dance music historyteeth on MANY of their Body & Soul tea parties at VINYL in NYC!!And they can do much better than this!!!!"
1,Never received and,I never got this product. And Amazon returned it and never made any attempt to resend this DVD to me. I will not order anything from this company again. It is easier to go directly to the vendors to get music or DVDs.
4,Good & Stylish Bookshelf,"I've had this bookshelf for about a few months now and it is perfect for my living room. I thought I wouldn't be able to find a fixture that would fit in the odd place, but this shelf was almost a perfect fit. It is for the most part very sturdy and is decent quality. We had a little bit of difficulty getting the shelf to line up perfectly with the legs, but it worked out. Overall the shelf is good for the price you pay and it looks great, especially if you are going for the more modern look. It also doesn't look ""cheap"". I would totally recommend this product to any of my friends and family.The price is now almost $100 less than what I had paid for back in August."
1,Buyer Beware,"The skits that are on the DVD are as funny as I remember them, but unfortunately, some of the best ones are missing. If Fox wants to label these boxes as ""Season One"" then they should at least tell us that the shows are edited and NOT COMPLETE. One of my all-time favorite ILC skits, the Aresenio Hall of Justice, is nowhere to be found. Don't buy this thinking everything is here, because it's not. It appears future sets are the same."
4,It's about freakin time!,"I was 9 years old in 1990, and even then I realized what a great show this was. for those who missed the reruns on cable such as myself, we now have the DVD box set! Looking back, it's kind of funny how dated the show is- the obsession with neon-colored clothing, for example. My major gripes however, are:1) The fact that the only special features are commentary -- no, not from Keenan, Damon, or David Allen Grier-- but by Tommy Davidson... and even then it's only on 2 episodes!2) No blooper/gag reel episode!!! I remember seeing a show where there were nothing but bloopers. Where is that episode?In my view, these are the set's only flaws. But I think they are major enough for it to warrant 4 1/2 stars, but since there is no 4 1/2, a 4 would be more appropriate than a 5. Maybe if more people point it out it would send a message (hint, hint)."
3,Not as funny as I remember,"In Jr. High I remember screaming with laughter over this series. Now it's so dated, and comedy has changed so much, that it wasn't as funny as I remembered and I rarely found myself laughing out loud while watching the DVD. It still has it's moments, but I'm glad I rented it instead of buying it."
3,disappointed.,"Alot of sketches have been edited or deleted, like the Tommy Davidson Mc Hammer sketch. If Fox is going to advertise that they are offering Season 1, you'd think that it would be as it was, in full. Don't get me wrong, what they do give is still one of the funniest shows that ever aired, just wish it was unedited. This is something they should state on the DVD jacket."
4,Gift for friend,I got this as a gift for a friend and she loves it. In Living Color is one of the truly groundbreaking TV shows in the history of TV and now I want to get the first season for myself.
5,Timeless!,"Man.This show is just as funny and relevant today as it was then.I dont understand why a reviewer would complain that they had too many jokes were about being black,since the show is made up of predominantly black comedians!What do you want them to make fun of?This show is great.The fly girls are hot!It doesnt matter if youre black or white.You will laugh your (...) off."
5,Thanks...!,"This company was great I received tracking information and received on Valentines Day which was a great due to it being a gift for my Husband. NO SCRATCHES, NO SKIPPING ! GREAT SERVICE"
3,GEGORY?,Well all I can say is that It's Geg . The picture is very low quality and the sound is JUS ok.
4,Great dvd from one of the greatest reggae singers of all time...,"I've seen Gregory Isaacs many times (live), and I can tell you that this dvd captures his true essence on stage. The video quality is average at best, but the audio is very strong...and the set list is fantastic as well. A must have, no doubt."
3,Thanks for the warning!,"I dislike paying so much for a book of reprints just to get one new story. I do like Putney's habit of making brief sequels to her novels in the form of short stories, however, so I may end up purchasing the collection. But her publisher should be informed that an immediate sale was lost because of this strategy.I appreciate amazon.com and the other reviewers giving me the titles of the stories so that I knew they were reprints. I prefer the publisher or main blurb review to be more honest about that.For those who have not read these stories, they are highly recommended."
4,Prime read for MJ Putney fams,"While this book was published a while back it was good to read stories well-written Ms. Putney. The latest two books written by this author have been disappointing to me, but this collection of short stories were what I have always liked about her books. Meeting characters in some of the tales that we have met in other books finished unanswered questions. The best story Ms. Putney even published was ""The Rake"". I have read and reread that story and absolutely will not lend the book to anyone for fear it might not be returned. In ""Sunshine For Christmas"" we find out what happens to Lord Randolph Lennox and in ""A Christmas Fling"" we get the answer about a character in the book ""The Spiral Path"". However, these stories stand alone, so even if one has not read the above mentioned books you will enjoy this book. There are three other short stories in the book--all good. I recommend it."
3,"A good course on spoken Arabic, but not perfect","This book (and tapes) provide a basic introduction to the dialect of Arabic spoken in Jordan, Sryia, and Lebanon. The book covers everyday situations such as greetings, shoping, resturants and so on. After working through the book, I feel like I have a good grasp of basic Arabic for travel puropses. One thing I really liked about the book was the fact that there are many pictures or the Arab world which help to break up the lessons. The main fault I have with this book (or tapes) is that the vocab words are never slowly pronounced so you can hear all the sounds in the word. Instead, there is just a dialog which is spoken quickly. As a result, it is difficult to pick out the sounds of the individual words. Since this is basicaly a course on spoken Arabic, I think this is a major flaw. However, if you are dedicated and work through the lessons you can pick up a lot."
1,Believe U Me,There is no way in the world anybody will walk away learning Arabic from trying this method. I don't know what this guy was thinking besides suckering people out of their hard earned money. Save your money and move to Egypt!
2,How can they still teach this in 2012?,"I just entered the World of Introduction to Philosophy. My professor loves Peter Singer. Put this book on the mandatory reading list. How in the world can these Academic geniuses still deny Social Biology and Psycology. It's the blank slate all over again. God help us if Philosphers get their wish and they decide how society should be. This denial of human nature, individual behavior, et al is beyond me. That behavior is based on how society tell us to behave. FOOTNOTE: I acknowledge and recognize that it's Nature and Nurture, Culture and the Indvidivual. Not one or the other .Can they please enter the 21st century?I respect Mr. Singer's beliefs in the environment and helping others. I'm sure he is a good person and per my professor a world famous philosopher."
3,Okay,"The book started out interesting, but after that, I don't think he has much to offer. It's like, he is telling you something you have already known."
5,Great Case,Purchased case to travel with some fairly expensive optics. Performed perfectly. Modular foam rubber system simplifies customizing. I'm sure there are other good ones out there besides Pelican cases but I don't need to look anywhere else.
4,Good value,The book has a lot of good color pictures. It is short on text. It is a very good value. Just don't expect to learn too much about the technical aspects of the car.
5,Thank you.,I knew Dean from his service to the Jesuit volunteer corps and only wish that I could thank him in person for his gentle scholarship and great gift to my prayer life.
1,WRONG ITEM AND NO ANSWER WHEN I CALL THE SELLER!!!!,"ORDERED THIS ITEM FOR WORK AND GOT THE PACKAGE TODAY....... THEY SENT ME A METAL I-PHONE CASE INSTEAD OF THE ITEM I ACTUALLY ORDERED AND PAID FOR, WHICH IS THE SAFARILAND (BASKETWEAVE) GLOVE POUCH. SO I GUESS I HAVE TO SEND IT BACK NOW AND WAIT AGAIN FOR THIS COMPANY TO GET THE CORRECT ITEM SENT TO ME. VERY FRUSTRATED THAT I PURCHASED AN ITEM WAITED FOR IT AND IT IS COMPLETELY WRONG AND WHEN I ATTEMPT TO CONTACT SELLER THERE IS NO ANSWER. I WOULD NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM THIS SELLER!!!!"
4,Not Art But I like It,"For a Playboy tape, this is not too bad - but it's not too good either. Since the subject matter is hot naked chicks I still loved the tape. Obviously all the women are DDG (drop dead gorgeous) which makes me wish I got to run the camera for the video shoot. Speaking of running the camera, you will see plenty of lovely faces, pretty smiles, and supple breasts, but you won't see much buttocks. When you do see the model's buns it's usually a quick glance during an action shot, such as when the Playmate dance, or walk, etc. In my opinion, Heidi Mark, Rachel Jean Marteen, and Alicia Rickter (who provides the tape with the finest bun shot) are the hottest girls on the tape. Overall, not bad for Playboy, but I wish they would show more nudity and close-ups."
3,No real stand outs for me.,"Alicia Rickter & Samantha Torrez are probably the best on the video. To me they should be the ""mid-level"" stars not the stars. It lacks a true star.Heidi Mark & Kona Carmach get honorable mentions this year. They are also good ""mid-level"" girls.Shauna Sand has a very pretty face & hair in the 1st clip then bad hair in the 2nd clip. She should consider a breast reduction.The rest I'll lump into the okay category & that sums up the year, mostly just okay."
3,Stacy Sanches was worth the price,"Stacy Sanches alone is what makes this tape. There are some other gorgeous babes too. But overall, if your looking for something erotic, stay away from Playboy. They spend too much time trying to be artistic and not enough showing the women."
2,Very little information,"The writer has some interesting articles, and cast lists, but no meat regarding the films. Other bio-bibliographies have information on the films, such as reviews, tidbits, etc. This book has nothing but the cast lists. Save your money and get a book on Wayne's films instead."
1,Terrible,"Buying this product was a huge mistake. I urge you to refrain from buying any type of Sony product that uses Sony Connect. It is the worst software when it comes to adding music to the player.The player itself was okay, great battery life, so-so screen, great idea with the USB connect. All of this is washed out because of Sony Connect. It makes adding music to the player because of share rights. Basically CD's that you own and burn to your computer are useless. Customer service is terrible. That's right Sony, I am calling you out of your hole. I will never buy another Sony product (which I consider their other proucts great) because of my distaste for Sony Connect.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. I HATE YOU SONY!"
5,Great CD,I guess this is a Seattle thing as only positive reviews come from there. I am originally from there so maybe thats why I am a fan. This is a great CD that takes me back to the days. As many say I am not sure how Sweet Water missed making it big. They are a great band and this is their best album. Rock on Sweet Water!!
1,book using print on demand technology,"Get the hardcover version. This is a print on demand version with no pictures, no real chapters, no paragraphs. It is literally a mish-mosh of text. This technology, as they explain it, scans the original text and then converts the info using Optical Character Recognition. If the 'robot' misreads the word, the word is converted inaccurately. I am sure this is a good book and I was looking forward to using it, but do yourself a favor and get the hardcover version. This is actually worth zero stars. Will be returning this book."
3,Disturbingly Entertaining,I thought this book could have been written much better than it was. But overall I enjoyed the story.
5,Gripping,"Miranda seems to have no backbone but that's going to change. She knows Bren is a dangerous prowler, a psychopath, but the problem is how to prove it, when no one wants to believe her and when everyone turns against her. Bren is soooo nice... Even the last page leaves you wondering is she will be safe for long. Very well written. You will want to grab Bren by the neck and kill the smile on his lovely face. One of the best books I read this year."
2,Not the best by this duo,"You can read the basis of the book in almost all the reviews so I'll cut to the chase. This isn't the best book by this team of authors. In fact, probably the worst I've read by them. Since these aren't series books, I'd skip this one unless you are a fan of the ""ouch that hurts... let's do that again club"". The whole premise is stupid since the main character has a family and friends that should have believed her in the 1st place. And it just keeps going and going and going and going. She is like the dumb herione in a horror movie where you are telling them not to go upstairs but they do anyways.... I expect my novels to be smarter than this."
4,"OK, it's trash, but for some reason I keep reading them.","This is my 3rd Nicci French book. I never read trashy novels and, honestly, these are trashy novels. The most amazing thing is that all 3 books are exactly the same story. Different names, different details, but same main character, small villian, really it's even the same story. So why did I read all 3. I have no idea. They're compelling somehow. Will I read another? Sure. Just for that reason alone I have to give it 4 stars. I subtracted one because this is truly bad literature. What an insane review, but I don't know how to justify my enjoyment of this junk."
2,Could've been better,"I like Nicci French's writing style, the way they describe the heroine's daily routine, the eating, the bathing, the relaxing, the working and all... But when it comes to surprising plots, twists and hooks, I have to say this book is so far behind you can't even see it! All I felt about Miranda while reading this book is that she was a pushover and wouldn't do anything AT ALL to defend herself. That went on and on for more than half of the book and it got on my nerves. There's absolutely nothing special about this book regarding suspense. Not that I regret buying this, but the funny thing is that I bought this book because at the time this was rated 5 stars here! :p"
1,A Terrible Purchase!,"Completely disappointed with this low-budget production that sounded like it was made in someones spare room. If you are looking to relive the enthralling sounds of Latin Christmas hymns, this CD is not for you. Very disappointing!JR - NJ"
1,piece of junk!,"I have a 250mm reflector and if you expects see things in the eyepiece like you do in a book well be prepared to be dissapointed. in teelscope of this size you won't relly anything so don,t spend your money on it!!"
5,A Truly Beautiful Storybook that Will Engage All Readers,"I was magically transported to a romantic time and place. The fantastic pictures that author/artist Parillo has created takes this book well beyond the typical children's storybook. It is truly glorious! My children adored it and I loved it. This is one is a ""keeper."""
3,Once Again: That Shearing Sound,"What a dissappointment! I thought, ""Finally, the Shearing Quintet in a modern recording. Now I can hear it like it was in the live performances I attended."" Not So! I have great respect for Telarc, but they really butchered this one. It sounds like it was recorded through a donut - dead, dull, muffled.It is stereo, but that's all I can give it. The Quintet plays great as usual, but they're ruined by the recording. I only give it 3 stars because there is no other modern recording of the Quintet."
3,OK as a reference,"Already being actively engaged in my child's schooling and ""broader education,"" I did not find the chapter content in this book very enlightening. I did, however, make note of many of the additional resources this book cites, as well as get many ideas from the pull-out stories and checklists throughout the book. There are a lot of those, which almost made up for the deficiency in the practical guide part. If you are looking to enrich your child's math and science education at home, or trying to find ways to help out at his school, this would be a good book to refer to. Just check it out at the library."
3,Therese,I was given a book to read about what I have experienced. I did not have time to sit and read so I bought this movie. I was expecting more than what I saw. If you know of a movie about her and shows what gifts she experienced I would appreciate knowing.
4,"Good book, hard to do",The book is well written but I think you must need special towels to make the figures work.
2,The Lost Art of Towel Origami,I thought the instructions were vague. They don't give you towel size and/or detailed instructions. It seems like they skip a few steps. I could only do two out of the whole book and was disappointed in my purchase.
2,Great for a gift,"This book contains many fun ways of shaping towels to give as gifts, or to decorate the towels you leave out for guests. While I agree that it's not really origami, it's still a lot of fun and a very cute idea.All of the projects that I've tried have worked out.The book itself would make a good gift for any quirky people that you know."
4,Great project for cub scouts and brownies,"Fun to read, fun to do! We first saw it done on a cruise. (Never realized that this art had ever been lost.)This is an activity that will engage youngsters without making a terrific mess. No paint or glue to smear on freshly painted or wallpapered walls. No sharp scissors to jab into the upholstery or hack at the curtains. If the technique is properly modeled for the children, every child will be able to be successful. And everybody has some sort of towel already, so there is no expense for this pleasure."
2,Very disappointing,"My daughter loves this kind of thing so I was excited to purchase this book for her. Almost all of the designs require a considerable number of towels along with other items like safety pins, felt, paper, etc. The few designs that can be created with only one or two towels look lame or don't work at all (at least without starch or something else to hold them in place) and I haven't bothered with the rest. Origami isn't the right description when so much else is required."
1,too simple; too few,"There were not very many different things to fold, all were simple - that is, they don't look that great when done. I've seen folded towels in a couple of hotels and they were stunning. The choices in this book just don't measure up. I wish I'd gotten a different towel origami book."
2,There are better towel origami books out there,I bought this book after getting into towel origami on a Carnival Cruise. This was disappointing. There were some okay ideas but all in all I would spend the $$ buying the Carnival Cruise towel origami book instead of this one. I bought this thinking that there would be ideas for a towel wedding cake. Thier version isn't near as pretty as the ones that I found searching online. Skip this one and buy the cruise one on EBAY.
4,Book Review,This book was exactly what I was looking for. It will make anyone a pro at towel animals. The pictures are clear as are the directions. I liked that their were actual pictures of every step throughout the process. The directions were easy to follow.
2,Not a great book unless you have lots of different types and sizes of towels,"I was pretty disappointed with this book and cannot really recommend it. First, over half of the designs are pretty boring and not really worth doing (Lips? A plain heart? Boring.) The rest of them seem to all use different sizes and number of towels. To do the palm tree you need FIVE hand towels. I for one don't generally keep *that* many towels of the same color lying around. The other main problem is the directions are not terribly clear. For instance, the instructions for the dog tell me to roll up the long ends into the middle, and after trying this a couple times, and wondering why it wasn't working, I realized it really wanted you to roll the *short* ends into the middle. Clear errors like this make it annoying to use and just not worth paying for when there are other cheap and even free sources out there for this material (try a google search for ""towel folding"" or ""towel origami"".)"
5,"Wonderful, you must try this!","This is the best thing that he has done so far, easily as good as his best Bach recordings. The recording quality is marvelous."
5,Beautiful,"One of the most beautiful pieces of music ever written. I listen to it over and over: at the beach, while I'm driving, or just playing in the background as I go about my day."
3,"Nice Jazz, but Vivaldi?","I enjoyed this interpretation, but sometimes lost the Vivaldi in it. I think perhaps, though, Vivaldi would approve."
3,The neglected Moe Koffman album,"Those who have not heard the earlier ""Four Seasons"" album by the Canadian jazz saxophonist, Moe Koffman, are not really in a position to evaluate the Loussier effort. Although there is merit in the Loussier recording, it cannot be considered to be in the same ball park as the Koffman album, from the standpoint of both jazz and the great Vivaldi. The Koffman album has been, in my experience, extremely difficult to find, but any suggestions along this line would be most appreciated."
2,BAK Universal Running Boards,"Seems odd to me that when I purchased my BAK Universal Running Boards, nowhere in the ad was it mentioned that I had to purchase the univerwsal mounting hardware seperately. If its all UNIVERSAL, why doesn't BAK package it all together, I mean universal means universal, right. And how exactly does BAK think I was going to mount their product on my Trailblazer anyway? What a mess."
2,Poor Reliability,"Bought this adapter because it said it was certified for Windows Vista. Although I had no problems setting it up, it frequently would lose the connection to the network (despite being only 6 feet away from the router). When I felt the adapter, it was very hot. Maybe I got a bad unit, but I'm returning it and trying something else."
1,Horrible product and customer service - stay away,"If you like being stuck on a technical support line for 30 minutes in the year 2007, please, by all means, use Linksys. If you like your adapter USB cable to actually DESTROY any signal-detecting capability, by all means, use Linksys. If you want your Linksys have to have the worst signal-detecting capability even WITHOUT the cable, by all means, use Linksys.Plus, there are spelling mistakes all over the box and in the software.Oh, the instructions on how to uninstall the drivers is just plain wrong.STAY AWAY FROM THIS LINKSYS PRODUCT."
3,Functional and easy to install,This took maybe 4 minutes to install -- very easy. I was hoping that the signal strenght would be better but it works just fine. My wireless laptop picks up a stronger signal than my desktop PC (on which I installed this item).
1,Lynksys Wireless-G USB Adapter,"Puchased item in anticipation of network expansion. Didn't happen so I can't give an honest review or rating, one way or the other. since I'm forced to give a rating, it will be 1 star until I use it. I am familiar somewhat with Cisco products, having been an IT administrator and used their commercial products, so I am confident that it will perform well."
5,Works for me,"I had been previously using a My Essentials USB adapter. But, the connection kept dropping or my computer wouldn't detect my home's wireless. This product was recommended to me by my tech-savvy friends. It worked right out of the box. I followed the set-up CD and didn't have any problems.Note: My computer is running Windows XP. My router is a Linksys WRT54G wireless G."
3,WINDOWS 7 OWNERS BEWARE,"I got this at Best Buy recently and was assured it would work in Windows 7 64 bit. NOT! It refused to install using the setup wizard CD. I had to download a Windows 7 upgrade on a zip drive in another computer. I then installed the adapter on my own computer using the zip drive and additional instructions from Linksys/Cisco. If you are a novice at this sort of thing you will have a steep learning curve. I finally got it installed successfully and it works fine. Maybe they have a Windows 7 version now, but be careful what you buy!"
4,Linksys Wireless - G USB Adapter,"Easy as can be to install and use. However, my only problem was the length. I was unable to plug into the back of my tower so I used the front access, which made it easy to be stepped on or bent (we broke ours)if you have to move the tower or have limited space so it sticks out as far as it does from the connection. If you have similar problems with limited space or available ports, I would recommend using a USB hub on a short cable so it can sit on the desktop or shelf. I would still highly recommend this product for use"
5,Somewhat bigger than I had hoped but works well!,"My notebook has built in wireless capability but in some environments it does not work well. When that happens, I simply plug in the unit and I am ready within seconds."
3,Your Decision,"My Wireless-G Router was giving me fluctuating connectivity. I was advised to buy this USB 2.0 and Wireless-G Adapter, as it claims to deliver data rates up to 54Mbps. I did not find that my connectivity data rate went up, but the connectivity was more stable, meaning uploading was not necessarily faster, but more predictable. I tried using it with the five-foot cord and moving it around. There were definitely some spots that were better than others for even reception. However, I can't say that I am convinced that this Adapter really made much of a difference other than making the connectivity more even. You can take that either way. If the price doesn't bother you, then it can`t hurt."
1,product does not work,Attempted for hours to install and set up then got a computer person to come to the house who also tried everything he could and the USB adapter sent is dead.
4,Linksys adapter,I bought this for my grandson to use on his computer. He said it worked great and the price was unbelievable.
3,No problem with Vista but short lifespan...,"I bought this product the first time in September of 2008. That one was either defective or we loaded it incorrectly because initially it worked just fine, but within 24 hours, if the computer were left alone for 20 minutes, we would lose the connection. Then it died altogether so we returned it to Target for a replacement. That one loaded perfectly and worked great until now (for 9ish months). Connection became spotty and then died altogether. After doing some research over Vista compatability issues, it appeared that Linksys was still my best bet. I will say that the sales assoc at Target told me that he uses a Belkin wireless USB adapter with Vista, and he has had no problems. Belkin and Linksys were priced the same, but since my router is Linksys and previous experience reigns, I stuck with Linksys."
1,Terrible Adapter and Customer Service,Do not buy this adapter! I was constantly losing the signal and after hours on the phone with customer service there was no change. After calls three and four I was told I if the adapter continues to lose connection Linlsys would replace it. I continued to have the same issues and Linksys refused to replace the adapter. Finally I just threw it away along with the money I spent on it.
2,Not The Most Powerful USB Tool,"I bought this because my daughter's old laptop did not have a card slot. We figured a USB Adapter would be the next best thing for our wireless network at home. The USB adapter sits less than 20 feet from the wireless router and has a wall with a door separating them. Many times it has had trouble picking up the signal from the wireless router when I don't feel this should be a problem. Both my wife and I have laptops with built in wireless receivers and have no issues picking up the router's signal anywhere in the house. However, it seems like this USB adapter has to be right on top of the router for the signal to be strong enough to link to anything. We've made it work but she still does not have the best signal in the world. I think I would look into something different if I were trying to come up with a networking solution now."
1,NOT WINDOWS 98SE COMPATIBLE,"Once again Linksys disappoints.The advertisements, packaging, and even the manual states that this is Windows 98SE Compatible.I placed the CD in the computer, run setup and I see the following information box pop up. We are sorry this product is not compatible with Windows 98SE.I used to count on Linksys for great products, with easy installation, and a very fair price. It is very evident that that is not the case anymore. I sure miss the old Linksys!!!I am almost to the point of not recommending any Linksys product anymore."
1,Doesn't work,I bought this for our extra computer in the basement. It indicates that it is connected to the wireless internet but I am unable to go to any websites. Calling the company just puts you on hold. The website lists many other people having similar difficulties. I plan to return this item.
1,Terrible product with lousy support,"I bought the Linksys WUSB54GC wireless USB adapter to connect to my new Linksys WRT160N wireless router. Although I am a fairly advanced user, I could not get the adapter to stay consistently connected, even though other wireless devices in the house stayed connected flawlessly. I called Linksys technical support. They were pretty lousy, and after speaking with 5 different representatives, the product was deemed defective. I bought a D-Link DWA-130 adapter as a replacement, and it has functioned great. So, either the product was indeed defective or was an inferior product. Either way, I was not too pleased with this purchase or the support for it."
1,Screws up your logon,"I couldnt figure out what happened to my login profiles. Its a real problem, I have no idea why it does that. I thought some virus was involved. The adapter works well in its functions but they have no right to mess with your logon screen and accounts. Why?Linksys should fix, I would buy another adapter until they resolve this faulty software.I'd return it but it is too late. Since I was new to pc, Id used macs and I had installed and removed alot of software from my new computer, I didnt know what cause the lack of multiple user account screen.I'm sure a hacker could fix the problem but for many people this will be a big hastle. I'm obviously annoyed since I reinstalled lots of software trying to fix it. I also didnt suspect that a driver for a small device would do that.im giving it one star for my pain and suffering!"
5,Excellent Solution for my Desktop's Wireless Access,"This product works great and was super easy to setup, took me about 2 minutes and i was online! I'm using it at my apartment for my Dell Inspiron desktop running Windows Vista OS. I have it in my bedroom, and our wireless router is a good 30 feet away in the dining room (blocked by several walls). The connection is excellent and I have had no issues at all...highly recommended !"
2,"Hardware seems fine, software is terrible.","This USB adapter appears to do its job OK, although the signal reception is (of course) poor compared to adapters with proper antennas.The software has one major flaw- a horrendous memory leak that renders the PC unusable after just a few hours. This kind of fault should never have made it out of the Linksys software group, and yet they have done nothing to correct it in the YEAR that this software has been on their website.I would not buy this product again."
1,This item did NOT work.,We had to ship it back because it would not work. We were NOT happy at all with this product.
1,Horrible software,"Don't get this!Installing onto a Win7 computer was way more complicated than it should be, and the reception was horrible. It picked up one bar when my laptop next to me got about 4.Putting this back in the mail tomorrow!"
1,Had to return didn't work,"Installed the antenna, hooked into my router, and never got onto the internet. Tried everything to compensate/ reinstall, but to no avail."
1,"Awful with Windows XP SP3, Windows 7","I had nothing but trouble with this device. First I had Windows XP, and it worked briefly on Win XP SP2, but as soon as Windows Update automatically updated me to Service Pack 3, it stopped performing properly. Extremely slow connection, and Windows kept trying to reset the network adapter. I eventually got Windows 7, thinking that maybe this would solve the problem, but no.I called tech support from Cisco/Linksys; they were not able to help.Eventually gave up, and bought Hawking HWUN3 Hi-Gain USB Wireless-N Adapter with Upgradeable Antennas for Mac & PC (White)from Amazon, which has worked fine (although the installation CD wouldn't install its driver, and I had to go online on another machine to the Hawking website, get the driver, put it on a portable drive, and then install it onto my Windows 7 machine. Since that time, perfect).I would avoid this Linksys/Cisco product if I were you."
1,"DON'T BUY, WASTE OF TIME,MONEY & ENERGY!!!","DO NOT BUY IF U R AN EXPERT OR A NON-EXPERT(GOD HELP U)!!I TRIED TO INSTALL THE DRIVER FOR HOURS & DAYS, THOUGHT I WAS D MAN UNTIL I MET THIS DUMB WI-FI ADAPTER!! I WANT MY TIME & ENERGY BACK LINKSYS!"
2,Stopped working.,"I don't know what to say besides that it just stopped working after about a year. It just stopped finding my router. Actually, sometimes it finds it. One in ten times I'll click find wireless networks and then the whole list of mine and my neighbor's networks would come up along with my hopes. But then it'll work for 5 minutes then I'll search again and it will find nothing. Would not recommend..."
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED.,"Unfortunately, this did not accomplish what I hoped it would and that was to give my husband's laptop more speed. Got this to replace the linksey's network card which only had 11 mbps. Was told the USB would get up to 54mbps but mostly will only show 11-18 and mostly low to very low connection."
1,Might work for someone else,I'm still trying how to figure this thing out. My laptop wont recognize it even though it's hooked up and the signal strenth is good. I had so many problems with this.
3,"Adapter Good, Setup Software Buggy","Adapter works well, but automatic setup software could not make a connect, setup needed to be done manually"
2,weak signal strength,"I am using the Linksys wireless adapter to connect to the wifi networks in cofee shops and the public libraries.1) It takes forever, more than ten minutes, to connect to access points.2) The signal strength is very weak, only three bars on average.3) The driver is resource hungry,the CPU usage is up to 80% every few minutes.4) The support is a joke, when I tried to upgrade drivers, the site still lists the original driver from 2005, older then what I am using.Don't waste your money."
3,didn't work out of the box,"I had a devil of a time installing it. Seems the USB cord was bad and after I finally figured that out, installation was a breeze."
3,Problems,I had trouble with the device from the begining. Lynksys support was not much help. I didn't feel that I should have to pay for their support either. I did read a helpful hint on their support web forum. Windows XP is now controlling the device without any problems.
3,Great Product but.....,"Windows it works fine.... but only after I bought it I discovered it takes some effort to get it to work under linux. Linksys does not support Linux very well and there is no support for this product under linux. This leaving having to use ndswrapper to make it work. Native support would be a welcome addition to this device. My Windows PC is directly connected to my network, but I am building a Linux system and it not tied into the network yet as I keep having to run a cable to it to get it online. Thus I figured a wireless adaptor would work for me till I can configure my workplace to have both systems nearer together to be wired. Turns out that not possible.Linksys should be ashamed they do not support Linux!"
2,"Not what is stated, read this.","Everything works perfect. Set-up easy and clear. However there is no cable or booklet included as stated, just the adapter and cd. I needed the cable to place higher on the wall for better reception."
4,Does the job it was meant for!,"I ordered this and received it a couple of weeks ago. Contrary to some of the negative views here, I was able to run the CD and install the driver easily. Then all there was left to do was to plug it into a USB adapter. I do not understand how an adult could not work this product as it is childs play. The product is reliable and receives a good enough signal that is also dependent on how far away your router is. In my case 30 feet still provided a low signal but had enough juice to work easily on the Internet for surfing the web and checking e-mail. I recommend this product to those looking to connect their desktop/laptop to the Internet via a connected router."
2,Wouldn't Recommend,Worked OK for about a week after which it became relatively useless. After about twenty minutes it would heat up too much and lose connection with network. It would cool down after only a few minutes and work for another twenty minutes. This became a very difficult process so I scrapped it and bought another linksy's Dual-Band Wireless-N Notebook adapter which frees up my USB port and works PERFECTLY. I was also able to find the new adapter for the same price as the refurbished Wireless-G adapter.
5,Wireless,The product came with the wrong installation software. I finally found a download online but it was quite a hassle
3,USB-Adapter,"Very good for my daughter computer..sometimes is hard to get signal, but overall it works fine..I will recomend this product.."
5,hacked mac friendly!!,"I purchased this device to work with my HP G60 that has Mac OS X on it (hacked mac doesn't recognize built in cards) and this device works perfectly. When I turn the computer on it automatically boots up the connect software. I've set up a profile, so the device automatically logs into my wireless network with the correct encryption type and pass key. When I turn my HP on this card just works. Every time. It was a great price too!"
3,Win 7 64 software install a no go.,The installer software down loaded from Linksys/Cisco will NOT install on Win 7 64. I had to go to the device manager and browse to the Linksys installer folder. Let Win 7 find the correct driver in that folder. After a reboot you will be good to go.
1,Disappointed,The signal strength is very low which means it failed to to fulfill its purpose. I'll cut my loss and try another product prehaps something from DELL.
1,Beware Windows XP Users : Wipes out user login screen,"Beware! If your OS is Windows XP and your computer is configured for multiple users who use login screen of Windows XP, this device will disable user login. Linksys support will not provide assistance as they say this product was designed to purposefully prevent use of multiple user login interface built into Windows XP. Search the Internet on:Linksys WUSB54GC Windows XP Userto see many descriptions of this problem."
2,Cassandra Cat ok but Carnival Story Cut,"I purchased this dvd because I was curious about Cassandra and as a backup to my copy of Carnival Story. I would give Cassandra a 3 , for quirkiness but Carnival Story has been badly cut--about 25 minutes of the film are missing--not a good buy if you're a Steve Cochran fan as I am."
2,A Bit of a Disappointment,"This toy is made well but my grandchildren, ages 5 and 7, did not want to use it on their car trip."
2,Happy Sails Indeed!,"I found this book to be very informative and helpful - the FIRST time I read it under the label of ""Cruise Control"". The information is great, but almost entirely repetitive of her first book. When I read this one, I was disappointed that I had invested in the duplicate disguised with a different title."
5,Excellent all around,"Don't be fooled by the fact these are covers of Marley tunes this is a classic. Bunny Wailer was a member of the Wailers for several year and upon leaving wanted to re-interpret many of the songs that Bob Marley and the Wailers cut in the 70's.And a great job he does. This stands as one of the great reggae albums in my book. Bunny Wailer remakes and then makes each song his own (several of them were originally written by him anyway).Whether you're fan of reggae, Bob Marley or just good music you'll love this album."
2,too expensive not worth it !,"I bought the grabber expecting the microphone would do a better job of picking up audio than my camcorder alone.I compared the audio pickup with my camcorder with no sound grabber installed to camcorder with the sound grabber fully installed into my microphone input.Note I used all sorts of configurations, flat plate on, flat plate off, mic turned toward the people, mic turned away from the people. The bottom line the sound grabber did not grab any more audio than the camcorder itself..in fact the camcorder microphone picked up more audio than the grabber.So if you are expecting this grabber to grab more sound than your camcorder alone ...you are going to be disappointed and you will be out 80 bucks...too expensive and certainly not worth it !"
1,WASTE OF PAPER,"Judging by the size of the book, you'll think you've got your money's worth. You may even go ahead to use only this book - Grave mistake.The questions are not similar to those of the gmat. The time allowed is 50% more than the time it takes to work questions in the real gmat (If you consider the time it takes to work Arco questions). The techniques (Sherlock Holmes, etc) are boring, lengthy and ineffective. The instructions for installing and operating the disk are poor. IF YOU DEPEND ON THIS BOOK ALONE YOU WILL FLUNK THE GMAT.THIS BOOK WILL DECEIVE YOU INTO A SENSE OF FALSE SECURITY. ARCO SHOULD GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD. THEIR TECHNIQUES ARE OUTMODED (STILL IN THE 50's)."
1,The worst remix project ever!,"Simply the worst remix album ever done! Unbelievable! These guys in Brazil must be kiddin'. The DJs don't seem able to reconstruct any of the songs. They only add very predictable and usual dance-beats (actually, old disco-music beats). Really a ridiculous release."
2,Not Really a Monitor!,"Stereo TV/Monitor HUH. Where's the VGA connector? or the DVI connector? Sorry...not really a monitor,,,Just a TV!"
5,Fantastic soundtrack!,"the movie wasn't great, but the music from it certainly is! billie holiday is incredible, and the CD is a fine compilation of terrific songs. i highly recommend it!!"
4,Forget Paris soundtrack,"Loved this movie and the soundtrack is enjoyable. Know that about 2/3s of it is instrumental, more than I remember on film. Still good listening and driving music:)"
3,Background music,"I liked ""Evita"" and was a little disappointed by this rendition. I would have preferred less piano riffs, which is mainly what the album has, and more jazz and blues influence. If you happen to like piano it is good background music."
3,good music but quite bad recording,when i listen to this cd. the arrangement is good the style and the music is also good. but the recording have an annoying noise.
5,I NEED A COPY,"How can we get to the zoo?? they've invited us all ... and you too , its a zookeepers party, we mustnt be tardy ,, but how can we get to the zoo... perhaps we could go by bus ....Please if ANYONE has this in any shape I would love to surprise my daughter at the birth of her first child."
3,fairly solid.,"while this album does contain a large quantity of good songs, it's still not as well written or exciting as ""Encendedor""..and isn't as adventurous as ""Against the Stars"". my least favorite of the three, but still a fairly good album."
4,Good looking and 720P,"I've owned this TV for almost two years and it has continually wowed me. Fed with DVDs, Directv, and HDTV it looks very, very good. In fact, it is one of the few models to display 720P without any conversion. This is excellent when watching any of the ABC shows in HDTV. Overall I am very happy with this set. It required a little bit of tweaking and there were two problems that were fixed under warranty but now it is stunning. I highly recommend this television."
4,"Only in America, and Only in Texas!","A few years ago, a friend of mine moved to San Antonio, Texas. Every year at the end of April, San Antonio holds ""Fiesta Week"" and the one of the main events is the Coronation of the Queen of the Order of the Alamo. The Queen, the Princess and 24 Duchesses display the most unbelievable gowns made anywhere -- the trains alone are many feet long, and are covered with beads and rhinestones, all to illustrate an aspect of the theme of that year's coronation. But that's just the tip of the iceberg.This book is a serious sociological study of this event and its history, but it also sheds light on the context of Coronation within the history of San Antonio, with some surprising aspects -- read about ""El Rey Feo"", and the Hispanic community's response to Coronation. It is fascinating start to finish, and could only be improved by the addition of more illustrations."
2,"36"" Tau, Maybe not for you!!!","The Panasonic Tau has the potential to be an excellent television, however I have had some unaddressed techinical problems with it. When there are darker images and flesh tones a ""streaking"" is observed to make it look like wavey when the faces or other images move slowly. However, the Picture quality in bright conditions is excellent. My daughter watches the movie ""A bug's life"" and it is amazing on this set. However, skip movies like ""The hunt for Red October"" unless you like to watch your characters streak."
4,A search for lakes hidden under the glaciers,"Although beautifully made this movie will only be interesting for people who are in love with glacier stuff. A team in search of lakes hidden under the glaciers of mount blanc of Europe is depicted in this movie. A great deal of information on how do they go inside the glacier, what equipments are used, how the blockage of water is detected from top to bottom flow of water by adding colour to it and all that stuff. Watch worthy and value for money for those who are interested."
4,Good but could of been better,"This film stars Soleil Moon Frye(Punky Brewster/Sabrina,Teenagewitch) and Brian Krause(Charmed/The Liars Club/Sleepwalkers).The films about Brians character who's girlfriend kills herself and you trying to figure out why? The story brings you to maybe a ghost of his girlfriend at his job/home. Is someoene trying to destroy him or is it his dead girlfriend? also,the film adds a crush that one of his students has of him, who is played in excellence by Soleil Moon Frye.This film actually deservs maybe two and a half to three stars,but the people in the film, especially Soleil make this film appealing."
3,"Good for Beginners, but...","Planting Green Roofs and Living Walls is an excellent book for any landscape architect who has not yet designed and detailed either. For myself, the most helpful bit of information was the data collected and presented from various green roofs.The living wall section on the other hand was thin. There was no mention of the living wall system Patrick Blanc developed which is much more interesting than putting up a wire trellis and planting vines next to it. The other comment i would have is that almost all of the examples are from Europe. We have fabulous examples in the US with more relevant plant materials and weather conditions.Finally I would say that the authors didn't seem interested in exploring native plant materials and instead focused on a few cookie cutter plants commonly planted all over the northern hemisphere. Not unlike McDonalds."
3,Nice examples of successful Green Roofs,"This book is great for those who may have trouble visualizing the possibilities of what you can do with a green roof. There are many examples of what you can grow, and what types of vegetation are suitable. The book is however not very technical about the architectural detailing considerations involved. Some sections and detail drawings would make this book much more valuable as a design resource."
3,Nice introduction but lacks depth,"While this book covers a lot of ground, it never digs in very deeply. How about some specifics on green roof components or support systems for living walls? This book doesn't provide those kinds of details. Although it has directories of plants for roofs and walls, the descriptions are very sketchy and, for most of the species, it doesn't provide hardiness zones. You'll have to be familiar with them or do additional research just to determine if they'll survive in your climate. For green roof plants, take a look at the Snodgrass book on green roof plants instead. Planting Green Roofs and Living Walls is a good introduction but you'll need to look at other books that provide more detailed case studies."
4,Great Automated BP Cuff,"Great device. Easy to use, comfortable and appears accurate as compared to my physicians readings. I like having the average of three readings calculated as well as the memory for tracking AM and PM readings.If you want a home BP cuff, consider this one."
5,great purchase,"I bought this for my pregnant daughter. She had a blood pressure issue with her last pregnancy and I didn't want her worrying about anything. It works great and she is very pleased with this purchase. Sometimes I buy things for my daughter and she wonders what I was thinking, but not with this monitor. She really likes it."
4,A must for future policitcal leaders,"If you are considering public office in small town America, then read this book."
3,Not his best effort,"3 1/2 stars.Jim Hall playing chart-heavy, progressive chamber-jazz? Doesn't work for me. Only occasional swing, little energy, dicey concept. Other aggravations: Too many cooks (liner notes indicate Jim's wife, his agent, Gil Goldstein, a transcriber); misleading credits (artists prominently displayed on jewel box credits, such as Joe Lovano, end up playing on one cut.But it's still Jim Hall, certainly one of the finest ever jazz guitarists. And it does pick up somewhat after a slow start. Still, probably for Hall completists only."
5,Great!,"We hung ours on the outside of our house where it's rained on, the sun beats on it and it's open to all aspects of Western NY weather. It's still looking good. No fading, chips, cracks or anything."
5,Knockout,"This is a killer album. Thanks once more to Kazaa for the ability to discover other worthwhile artists. The album is full of great songs, tasty guitar and vocals that make you want to join in (even me the non-singer!). About half of the albums features songs from blues masters such as Elmore James (I Can't Hold You), Howlin' Wolf (Forty-Four), Robert Johnson (Walkin' Blues) and Barbecue Bob (Atlanta Moan), while the other half were co-written by James himself. James manages to package those songs into a variety of styles: pure blues (Bad Habits, Forty-Four), ballad like (Atlanta moan), uptempo rock (Real Stuff), blues/rock (Walking blues), to whatever you want to call it (Saviour / Freedom). As a bonus, vocal from Mavis Staples adds much to the 'Freedom' track and Kim Wilson plays great harmonica on 3 others. The thing I love most about the guitar playing is his ability to get so much feeling without playing many notes. His slide work is also top class. Almost every track is a highlight."
1,MY REVIEW ABOUT THIS PRODUCT,because the taste was very bad an cookie was to hard will not recommed for any of my friends or family to try.

4,Still great!,"Along with Dr Seuss, this author uses funny-sounding words to tell his story. I'm looking forward to sharing this with my grandkids! I think this type of book helps teach kids a love of reading and language."
1,Not Good!,"This is without one of the most disappointing short-story romance anthologies I have ever read! The first story with the abusive Tolly and his basically getting away with it and still winning the love of Sarah who was stupidly convinced by Pricilla and Hawk to forgive him and give him another chance totally marred what could have been a terrific book! Yes it even marred the romance of Pricilla and Hawk! Okay so it was Tolly's ex-girlfriend who he beat up and not Sarah but he was verbally abusive to Sarah and the fact that he physically abused his ex should be a warning sign to Sarah, Pricilla and Hawk."
3,I bought it for the gorgeous cover!,"This book has nothing to offer in terms of stories, but I just love the cover - John DeSlavo looking so dashingly romantic that made my knee weak. I am more than willing to hand over my hard-earned bucks for it.5 stars for the publisher's marketing team + 0 star for the authors = 2.5 Stars overall ."
4,Intriguing,"There are many things that stand in the way of the heroes' happiness, and for a change, it is not lack of communication. They are torn between love for each other and responsibility to their families. I liked it that they were able to talk to each other and explain their fears and their feelings - and if sometimes they didn't say everything that needed to be said, they had good reasons for it. The story had quite a few unexpected twists and turns. I liked it. A lot :)"
3,No bluegrass here!,"The head review says there's some hardcore bluegrass - not true. That must have been written by someone who has never heard bluegrass music. This is a country pop album through and through. I listen to their first two Rounder CDs all the time so I write as a fan. Despite my disappointment, there are some pleasures to be had. There are a few new Sidney Cox songs and two Del McCoury songs I'd never heard and that makes the CD worthwhile. Adam Steffey plays mandolin throughout and that is always a pleasure. Still, this is nowhere near a bluegrass album. It is country pop so caveat emptor."
3,Too slick,"Somewhat disappointing. Too much of a slick modern country sound; not enough bluegrass harmonizing. A few of the songs are good, and the singing is well done, but if I had heard it before buying it, I would not have bought it."
1,Disappointed beyond belief,"This is the first bad rating I've ever given any CD I bought.....all I can say for this is YUCK! I thought the vocals were wonderful, the harmony great, but the choice of songs and the music were not what I expected."
1,worst book I ever read,"I am working on a metadata driven project. So I ordered this book.I opened the book, It it looks like a 2 year VB programmer view on software development. Lots of Ideology and preaching, but nothing concreate. like ""Interfaces should never be changed"" which is fine, nobody changes an interface for the fun of it, but what you do when you have to.or ""make your classes small, with small interface, and make as few classes as possible"". again, it is like saying it is better to be healty,handsome and rice than ill, ugly and poor.My main reason for the purchase were the rave reviews that apear on this page.Re-reading them - they do not seem authentic to me."
1,Not good.,"This is a 400+ page commercial. None of the concepts are really new, they're just common sense. Like some people, I bought the book based on the ratings, but the ratings are misleading. I'm fairly certain all of the 5 star ratings are fake."
5,Rating - 5 is not high enough!,"Our teams have used parts of these concepts for years, but this is the first time I've seen them integrated, and in way that makes sense. The author puts real flesh on the bones - and gives credibility (at last) to true reusability for application software. Why hasn't someone thought of this sooner?"
4,she did it again!,"sezen aksu, known as the goddess of turkish music started to give the signals of opening to the world as an ethnic singer two or three albums ago. And this is the proof that she deserves it. She got one step further than natasha atlas in combining the spirit of east with the understanding of west. Including a duet with the diva of greek music Haris Alexiou, Deliveren is a must be bought album for me. Worths every cent you pay it!!!"
5,Another Triumph for Sezen,"As an American who is married to a Turkish woman and who spent some years living in Turkey, Sezen Aksu's beautiful music has been an important part of my life's soundtrack (""Sen Aglama"" has provided the background music for many a romantic evening). So I am happy to report that, with ""Deliveren"", Sezen Aksu continues her unbroken 23-year record of never putting a foot wrong. Her powerful, warm, never-more-mature voice and the album's rich, romantic production and arrangements make this Sezen's best album in years - maybe ever. So get your sweetie, a bottle of wine, and a box of lokum and sink into ""Deliveren"" warm embrace."
5,"Wonderful Gal, Wonderful Album","I love Sezen Aksu's traditional approach to the songs on this album, especially selection # 4, Keshin Bicak. This song alone makes the album worth owning, but don't worry, you won't have to fast forward through everything else. The other songs are a delightful mixed bag.This album was my first exposure to Turkish music and to Sezen Aksu. She deserves her title as the Diva of Turkey. My other big favorite is selection #7, O-kudum-da, as fun and rollicking as Keshin Bicak is sexy and sorrowful. ""Deliveren"" is a happy addition to my list of five-star reviews."
3,Encyclopedia look at Christian music,"This book is an excellent source of dates and names. However, it is lacking personal glimpses into the lives of the artists. We find out the songs and albums produced by a number of Christian artists (and those preferring not be identified as a Christian artist) but the book is almost completely devoid of personal interviews with the artists or profiles of their life experiences and influences.The book is useful as an encyclopedia of the history of Christian rock and roll but begs a follow-up book profiling more in depth some of the artists such as Terry Taylor, Steve Taylor, Larry Norman, and Phil Keaggy.Also, a minor note here but the author also drops the name of his band (The Wayside) more often than the band's success to date would warrant."
5,new owner,"i just recently recieved my FP10 in the mail and i've used it just a few times. thus far i'm very impressed with the sound quality! i'm using it as a go-between for my instruments and cubase le recording software. it's simple (which may be a pro or a con depending on your needs) and easy to hook up and use. limited control is basically what i'm talking about when i say it's simple.basically you just plug and play.anyway i like it, maybe you will too."
3,colorful,"I really dug the pictures in there, they were really groovy. Real good flesh eating plant background, solid tips on raising these feisty critters. Didnt work for me though. Had an indoor terrarium and everthing dried up. Sorry."
5,Savage Garden - great book,Pictures on almost every page. Very easy reading and very informative. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in carnivorous plants.
5,A Brilliant Display Of Organization And Knowledge!,"Peter D'Amato displays his incredible knowledge of carnivorous plants in a book that is brilliantly organized. Cultivation and propagation pages are set in pastel green colors for fast and easy reference. The book is full of detailed cultivating information, fascinating historical accounts, and beautiful color pictures. The Savage Garden is an essential part of any carnivorous plant enthusiasts' library."
5,A delight,"This book contains everything you'll ever want to know about carnivorous plants. Whether you're a complete novice or an old hand there's something for everyone. The instructions are comprehensive without being off-putting. The book is peppered with spectacular colour photos throughout so you can really see what the plants look like. Even though it's not a children's book, children will enjoy looking at the pictures. It's even got a cool title!"
1,$2 on iTunes,This is a great Documentary and any Disney or Animation fan should see it but why pay so much? If you want all the bonus features then go for it. If you just want to see the film itself you can buy it on iTunes for $1.99.It's worth seeing either way.
5,A real groover,"That this album has gone virtually unnoticed through all these years (since 1991) is incomprehensible.Call it smooth jazz, world jazz, spiritual jazz; it actually transcends all these labels. It just swings like crazy.Chieli Minucci brings his guitars to sing so sweetly. George Jinda, Fernando Saunders, Lionel Cordew and Omar Hakim create a beat that takes over your whole system. Michael Bearden, Steve Skinner and Randy Roos form a lovely atmosphere with their pianos and synths. And Fernando Saunders really sings beautifully on Quiet Beauty.If you love yourself and your neighbor(s), then get this album and crank up the volume. Let the whole world hear!"
1,French teacher's take,"I was happy to see this in DVD format because I wanted to show it to my classes in French but when it arrived I found it did not have English or any subtitle features. I could have bought the original VHS, but waited for the DVD for the subtitles. Dommage."
3,"Good, Not Great","This book follows Buffy through three years. The years she turns 18, 19, 20. Buffy faces trials, and dangers, and as usual, Giles has to help her to survive.While this was a good book, it wasn't anything special, and doesn't compare much to the others in the Buffy the Vampire slayer series."
2,Big bad for BG shippers,"If you're a BG shipper, don't read this book! It will only annoy you to no end... trust me, I should know. Although there is still quite a bit of subtext that kept me grinning, most of the book revolves around a father/daughter relationship... sigh."
5,Just plain fun.,This may be our favorite Christmas album. Great swinging arrangements of popular Christmas songs by really fabulous swing era bands. Hurry December!
5,Not full of hope.,"Although I've not read the translation into English, I wanted to set the record straight and indicate that this novel is not ""full of hope."" It is, however, a completely engrossing story. One finds oneself being seduced by Jorge and pulled into sharing his vision of gambling, the world, and himself, which is an indication of Peri Rossi's virtuosity as a writer, as this pessimistic, superior and world-weary vision is apparently not her own."
2,very bad product,"this cane pole was the correct length, but, very weak at the end and broke at first use,.......... a piece of crap and a waist of money, i would like my money back.william l redmond"
4,Bad Company - 'Company Of Strangers' (Eastwest),"The very first time I ever heard this CD,I thought that MAYBE Paul Rodgers was back in the band.Okay,THAT-I admit was wishful thinking.New(at the time of this release)vocalist Robert Hart fits in quite well with the long running veteran blues hard hard outfit.Some of the better cuts here include ""Where I Belong"",the radio friendly ""Down,Down,Down"",""Pretty Women"" and the rockin' ""Down And Dirty"".Too bad Hart didn't last long with the group.I have a feeling the follow-up to this disc could've really been something.I guess we'll never really know.Bad Company had apparently reunited with Rodgers awhile after the tour for this disc.Long live Bad Co.!"
4,4 1/2 STARS,"One of Bad company's better cds, their first with their new lead vocalist. Gone is the loudness of their late 80's early 90's cds (most of which were good). The group has returned to their roots, but this time around the writing is better, better produced, and the singing 10 times better, a shame the public didn't think so. Some outstanding songs on this cd, ""Clearwater Highway"", ""Down and Dirty"",""Loving You Out Loud"", ""Your the Only Reason"", and the title track. Nice change of pace for the band. Shame this lineup didn't stay but for one more cd."
3,Not Ruiz,"This appears to be a film by from 1961 by Gilberto Gazcon, which is not to be confused for ""Three Sad Tigers"" by Raoul Ruiz shot in 1968. So be careful, because Amazon is recommending this for Ruiz buyers and they should not be."
1,poor quality,"This watch was a bust. They claim it's water proof, but it stopped working the first time I went in the water with it. They took it back to be repaired. It took over 2 months and then when I got it back - it still didn't work properly. Sent it back again, took another 2 months to be repaired. It stopped working again after a week. Customer service is good and they gave me my money back. But the watch was not worth the aggreviation."
1,Disappointement,"I hate to write a bad review but I must say this is the worst watch I've ever had. Clicks are not smooth, rubber band sticks on my wrist (too solid) and to cup it all : It came defective !!!!!!!!I wanted my money back..., because i never had this kind of problems in my life, ESPECIALLY with watches !!!!I have sent it back at least for a replacement or repair.I'm waiting for already 3 weeks..., and they don't get back to me.VERY DISAPPOINTING !"
1,Hmmm......,"Annie Andifers from Wisconsin is a dern idiot. At present, Patton's Peeping Tom project is, just that, a project. Aside from a few demos (and Annie is right about them sounding good) Peeping Tom is yet another Patton project we fans will have to hold our breath for and (hopefully) exhale sometime in 2004. Wishful thinking, maybe?"
4,"Good product, good packaging, good service",We purchased this typewriter and needed a ribbon for it. I found this one online andordered it. Very pleased.
3,Interesting review of Egyptological subject,"If this is a review of the History Channel program about the Rosetta Stone that had Leonard Nimoy as narrator - I watched it and had one thing that impeded my aprreciation of it. The narration referred to the script version of the hieroglyphs of ancient Egypt as the ""DEMONIC"" script. Wrong!! That script is called ""Demotic"" script. And this slipup, repeated constantly, kept me from watching this with full concentration, always wondering how many other things they got wrong."
3,Glad to finish!,"This was a book that I felt had a lot of potential, but didn't live up to it. I had a hard time finishing it, but I did. I hate to give up on a book, so I slogged through it. The characters were okay. The hero, Rafe, had a lot of potential, and I actually thought he was quite good. The heroine, Kyria, struck me as sort of strident and snippy. I really didn't like her. I realize she was the ""Goddess"", but I felt she was just rather unlikable. I found myself skipping through the mystery parts to get to the romance. The mystery, while well written, was just not interesting to me. I usually like Candace Camp's work. In this instance, I felt she slipped into the later(and not necessarily better) Amanda Quick mold and gave up the romance for the madcap adventure bit. For me, it didn't work."
4,"four lines, four tracks, four stars",very catchy stuff.it will be in your headyou will be dancing in the streetsadly just four tracks.
3,Realistic,"Pekar's writing is great enough that it rises above the subject matter he's chosen, namely himself and his very boring life. Overall an important part of American graphic novel history, just not my can of worms."
3,why would I want to enter the mind of a pathetic cynic?,"I've only read half of this collection, so maybe the truth my eyes have been shielded from lies in the second half. If that's the case, I apologize for this negative review. Now:Harvey Pekar (or his other aliases) is an annoyingly grumpy middle-aged man whose only focus is complaining about the world, or collecting jazz records. There's nothing philosophical or insightful about collecting jazz records. Not even if you explore the subject in every other strip (as this collection so aptly does). This is a bitter man who you'd never want as a friend. And if you did, he'd think you were stupid to want him as a friend. His outlook is so cruel and pessimistic, its hard for me to relate.One thing I do have to give Pekar props for is putting his life out there like this. He was showing the world who he was unabashedly, and for that I respect him. I just don't like him. He's a jerk.writing: [5.5/10]art: [8/10]"
5,Harvey rocks!,"""Ordinary life is pretty complex stuff"". After seeing the trailer of the movie adaptation of American Splendor I knew that I had to see it. Although I haven't been able to see the film just yet, I did get a chance to purchase the book in my college bookstore! Harvey has a way of writing his comics to give you the REAL way of looking at the world in which we live in. Having had a friendship with Robert Crumb makes Harvey Pekar's work right up to par with Crumb. I think that Harvey Pekar is one of the best comic book writers out there, although under-rated, but I think that he's been able to come through for the fans and I can't wait to see the movie!This is our world, this is life, this is American Splendor :) ."
5,Splendid glimpse into the male mind in a comic book format,"American Splendor: The Life and Times of Harvey Pekar is the largest published collection of the comic series, containing the complete text of American Splendor and More American Splendor. With an introduction by R. Crumb and art by Kevin Brown, Gregory Budgett, Sean Carroll, Sue Cavey, R. Crumb, Gary Drumm, Val Materick, and Gerry Shamray this is 320 pages of a classic American comic.Pekar's work is a cerebral approach to the comic medium. Many of the panels have no dialog and only illustrate the external while the text reveals the thought stream of Pekar's mind. His ability to portray the inner workings of his thoughts, in a humorous and sympathetic manner, is the key to the success of his writings. The comic is a working class version of Seinfeld with a populist self-made intellectual as the leading character. Yet there is a Existentialist angst to this work that puts it in a class by itself."
5,True Western Writing,It is refreshing to read a well crafted western by an author that is obviously very familiar with the subject. Mr. Flanagan tells a gripping tale in true western form that keeps the reader entertained. I am happy to recommend this book to anyone who enjoys this genre.
3,Not for everyone.,"I enjoyed this book, but cannot think of anyone to whom I will pass it along. It is a very quiet, introspective story.I continually had the feeling that the author was laying the groundwork to begin his story, but that's the tone that continued through the book...a plodding, solemn walk through a man's life after his emotions are fossilized.I am not of the Christain faith, so perhaps I could not relate the way Christians would."
2,Adjectives,"Trite, banal, unctuous, smug, prurient, tetchy.mundane, vacuous, tiresome, disappointing.haha, I guess most of those really aren't true,read it if you want to.To some certain extent, all books do the same thing,many of them present the same ideas.I just wrote this review because I don't believe this bookdeserves four and a half stars."
3,A tested faith,"In MR. IVES CHRISTMAS, Oscar Hijuelos' gives us Mr. Ives, a quiet spiritual man who is loved and loves. Ives is successful in his profession, he loves his family and friends, and he is truly a part of his community. Hijuelos also presents us with Mr. Ives' great agony; the sensless murder of his son and his desperate attempts to understand it. We see Ives' life in brief glimpses, each time we get a better understanding of the man and the world that he is part of, but he still remains a cipher. It's as if he is not a fully formed person, or perhaps it's the distance that Hijuelos wants to create in this man who does not truly know where he came from. I found this distance to be my great obstacle in liking this book more. Ives is more symbolic of a crisis of faith than he is a human being. I couldn't connect with him even as he was in the throes of anguish. Hijuelos' prose is marvelously readable, he creates a Manhattan that you can feel. Too bad I can't say the same thing for mr. Ives."
2,Not for me...,"Found the novel to be meandering, slow moving & full of descriptions that weren't needed.One paragraph spanned more than 2 pages.Just didn't relate to the characters or care much for them."
4,"Evocative Observations on Work, Forgiveness, and Redemption","I heard Oscar Hijuelos on a radio show when this book first came out, and it sounded appealing. Hijuelos is so talented and there are many pleasures to be found in reading Mr. Ives' Christmas. The narrative of sadness, forgiveness, and redemption are skillfully crafted and never maudlin. The way he evokes a sense of time and place, especially winter in New York, totally allowed me to become immersed in the setting. Finally, his tenderly written observations of work, family, and church capture the beauty in ordinary things"
5,Remarkably Beautiful,"""Mr. Ives Christmas"" is about a faithful man whose teenage son is cruelly murdered at Christmastime. It's a stunning story about religious faith. Hijuelos takes things of the spirit very seriously, and sacred events indeed occur in the novel. It climaxes with a series of epiphanies, in the very literal sense of that word. Hijuelos makes frequent fitting reference to Dickens and ""A Christmas Carol"" because his story is about the tragedies of life, but also the grace of God that is available to ""those that are good."" I finished this novel at 3 a.m., in tears. I can't recommend it highly enough."
3,"Brill Push Mower, cheaper than a gym","Very light weight, almost too light, it has a tendancy to bounce over parts of the lawn that are not smooth. Requires more than one pass for truly manicured look. No need for a catcher as it mulches nicely. I have it on the highest cut setting and wish it was a bit higher yet. If you mow twice a week during the growing season its very easy to use and still gives good exercise. Pays for itself in a month with saved gardner and gym fees."
5,excellent TV for the buck,"I can't list price, but I paid well below other brands in a similar size because I got it at a Thanksgiving special at circuit city. I am extremely pleased with it so far. Excellent picture (slight differences in brightness and quality when comparing side to side at the store, but are you going to do that at home?) providing outstanding picture on everything I've watched, DVDs and cable. This TV has it all for a great price: HDTV, progressive scan doubling, 3:2 pulldown, great virtual surround sound, built in protective screen, picture in picture and split screen, nice remote, etc. Sure it's not plasma quality, no projection TV is. But for your buck you can't go wrong with it. I'm still AMAZED!!! Only problem is that the 56"" is slightly TOO big for my little apartment! Enjoy!"
5,Amazing,"Robert Kiyosaki is very inspiring and full of knowledge. If you want to learn from one of the best. Get his books, cd's, and dvd's. He is worth the money!"
5,Grateful option,"Enough has already been said about the superior content and technical quality of the DVD set, to which I add an enthusiastic, ""Yeah, Yeah, Yeah."" What I'd like to mention is the fortunate inclusion in the audio selections of PCM, I do not have a 5.1 setup and rely on conventional stereo for sound. If there was no PCM option, I would lose the bass. I wouldn't have bought it if that had been the case. I am grateful that the menu gives the option for conventional stereo systems without sacrificing fidelity. That really makes this set a winner for my situation."
1,Not worth it. There are other that are much better.,Don't spend your money on this video. There are other videos that show the art of Skydiving much better.Call the United States Parachutist Association and ask them to help you find other titles.
3,Be aware that this is not a book for Beginners ...,"In the past 10 years I have been reading many dozen of technical computer-related books. I bought this book to learn about Servlets and despite the very-good customer reviews on the amazon.com, the book showed to me to be of not use. It is not as easy to follow - easy to implement code as it could be.The book is NOT direct to beginners in Servlets and if your interest when buying such a book is to learn the basics of Servlet, you better off buying some other book on this topic."
3,kind of sterile,"This album just doesn't live up to some of Jim Hall's other work. This just seems kind of hollow, and Jim's adoption of the use of effects on his guitar takes something away from the playing. Do yourself a favor and check out other stuff by Jim Hall first (i.e. his recordings with Paul Desmond.)"
1,Feeling Let Down,"I bought this book based solely on the reviews. I really wanted a great animal book for my 2 year old son. He loves another animal book called Animal ABC and it is filled with page sized animals with no writing except the alphabet. This book looked and sounded like it was similar because it is full of 365 animals and it's called the BIG book of animals. It's not so big. Every page is filled with many animals and a lot of them are drawings (not cool), so it ends up being quite a thin book. I am not impressed and won't recommend this book to anyone. If you want pictures, look for something with full page photography and not drawings. If you want information, this has it but at a very small scale. You won't be able to learn more than an introduction to these animals."
1,i hate interviews,"short 5 minute interview with weird chanting in background and thunder.i prefer music!""rpm"""
3,custom floor mats,these are above average floor mats. not as good as oem but better than one size fits all approach to replacement floor mats
5,Between The Buried and Me,"Between the Buried and Me's debut is an amazing album. It is a must buy for any btbam fan, and even any metalcore fan in general. There are loads of tempo changes, and the singing goes from deep growls to high pitched screams to choruses with clean vocals. All of the songs are great, but the best ones are More Of Myself To Kill, Arsonist, What We Have Become, and Shevanel Cut a Flip. Shevanel Cut a Flip is a great example of btbam's range. It begins with a fast paced assault on your ears, then suddenly enters a mellow restaurant scene with the band members talking about random things. Then it goes back into the changing tempos and screams, and finally enters a sleep-inducing acoustic section. It's really good. I would also recommend checking out their other albums if you enjoy this one."
5,this has become my everyday watch,"I am a bit of a watch geek, and have historically owned 2 or 3 favorites that I rotate depending on my mood. I have owned this watch for almost two years, and I now wear it nearly every day. I am as pleased with it now as I was when I received it. It looks great dressed down with jeans and a sweater, and it looks equally good dressed up a bit. The FC5000 band that came with mine (black rubber) is easy to clean, and doesn't get brittle or pick up stains/smells that a leather band picks up if you wear it every day.When I travel, I love having the ability to display two time zones as well. The only time I don't reach for this watch in the morning is if I am going somewhere formal. Other than that, I'm nearly always wearing this watch, and I love it. I will definitely look at Tag again when (if) I shop for another watch."
4,Swing meets Country in this Underrated CD,"Country music and swing jazz are not usually paired together, but they are in this album with fabulous results. Starting with the title track, Restless, and ending with the album's final cut, Swingtown, this album combines fine jazz fiddle work with steel guitars, along with an irresistable beat and Shelby's great vocals for a fun underrated CD. Shelby shares songwriting credit on 5 of the 10 songs showing her breadth of talent. Jamie O'Hara writes or co-writes 6 of the 10 tunes. Not all the songs are jazz, as some are country soaked blues with wailing harmonicas and sad, cry-in-your-beer lyrics. Another highlight on this album is Wish I Knew, a blues infused song with Shelby's soaring vocals that will leave you with goosebumps. All of this on an album that is now found in the bargain bins. Pick it up and experience some great tunes from an underrated performer."
5,All Time Favorite,"I'm a huge Shelby fan and this is one of my all time favorite albums. I think I've replaced it twice, I've listened to it so much."
3,A 1995 Release,"Not sure why Amazon shot me a mail about this album. Like a fish going after a cornflake I grabbed it, thinking it was a new release. I noticed her hair was different, and should have looked deeper, but this is from her older music. Lots of country sounds like slide guitars.I gave it 3 stars because there are 3 good songs, in my opinion. There are hints of things to come when she sings and the band is not the focal point. I'm no country music fan, but if you are a real Shelby Lynne fan you might want to get this."
2,Disappointing...,"After purchasing Shelby's ""I Am..."" I was disappointed to listen to this CD. The voice and sound are of a quality common to every country music theme park in the US. Only one track really has the ""blues"" feel of some of her other CDs.But, if you are a huge mainstream country music fan, this one may be for you."
4,"Very good, but needed more expanding on the suicides","The book kept me on the edge of my seat, and wanting to read more every time something horrific took place. The first of the 5 suicides was described quite well, and in lots of detail. The only thing that the story was lacking, was how they explained the first suicide so much, yet didn't really expand on the last 4. I would have liked to hear more about those last 4."
3,3.5 Stars,"Let me start by saying that I'm a huge Das Efx and Hit Squad fan. Das is definitely a very innovative group with crazy lyrical flows.This album as a whole is good, but there is a good amount of lackluster tracks. I guess this is really just because the two albums before this one were just uncommonly good. On ""Straight Up Sewaside"", it was one hard hitting track after another. But on this album, we see a lot of tracks with overly-simple beats and monotonous rapping. It's kind of evident that Das Efx was fading a bit by this release.However, ""40 and a Blunt"", ""Here We Go"", ""Dedicated"" and ""Alright"" all feature amazing beats and vibrant rapping you can expect from Dray and Skoob.Definitely a great hip-hop album, just far from Das Efx's best."
5,Classic Hip Hop,"This LP is about twice as good as I expected it to be, this one is slept on. Not a big fan of previous Das releases. If you like early to mid ninties style hip hop this album is probably for you. Represent the Real is probably the most slammin track I've ever heard KRS-ONE on, what a heater! On a side note 3 or 4 of the more average tracks could have been cut to make this a perfect release, but they don't really hurt either. You won't be disapointed by this release if your down for real hip hop!"
5,Slept on album,"This is a massive slept on album.AMG gave this 2 stars.That's their opinion,but to me this is a damn great album.This is probably das efx's most hardcore album they ever made.I don't want to say much but pick this album up if you don't have it.Peace to everbody who gave this album a review."
5,Great game,Our family loves this game. A DVD game is a great way to get the whole family to play. No board or games pieces to lose either. Hope there will be more volumes to come.
5,Beautiful CD,Mandy Barnett's CDs are absolutely beautiful.....the voice of an angel. I feel anyone and everyone would enjoy her singing and music. A very rare talent in today's choices!
2,Great Voice - Fair Arrangements,"If you bought ""Right to Cry"", and want more of the same, this might not be your solution. Like many first-releases, this one suffers from boilerplate arrangements. Too bad, because Mandy's stunning voice is too often beaten down by the background.You might want to wait for Mandy's next release."
5,finally gravy in a boat and not a bowl!,I have put off getting the gravy boat for years as it was too exoensive until now. I love it! I no longer have to have gravy in a bowl with dripping down the sides!
5,Lenox,MY friend loves the gravy bowl. It is her first set of china and it is beautiful to her. Highly Recommend it!
1,Space Saving??,"Do not get the idea that this is space saving? It takes up as much, or more room as any tv. If you want a HD compatible tv with a good picture, this is not the one to get. Go take a look at the SONY XBR sets. They blow this away."
4,Sony vs Panasonic,"I finally settled with the Panasonic 36"" HDTV over the Sony 36 Wega. I bought the Wega last year and had nothing but problems with the picture. My eyes couldn't handle the brightness and contrast settings.. they were just too too bright. Watching sporting events where there were a lot of white jerseys would drive me up a wall. I looked into the HDTV Sony and it did the same thing.. I now have the 36"" Panasonic HDTV and I am totally content with the picture. I did a lot of investigations and they say to get the AVIA setup disk to get the colors down.. then you'll have a picture like NO SONY! I LOVE this TV!"
2,"Hog Wash,","No, I am not French but the majority of this recording SUCKS in ANY language. I have owned this cd for 9 years and I never get past the 1st song ""In the Meantime"" the rest of em' come on; immediately I lose interest. Faster than a blind date with your mom.""In the Meantime"" is this CDs only saving grace. Save your pennies, this one is hog wash!"
5,Spacehog is the best,"I've had this cd since it first came out and ever since then i have listened to them more and more and now they are my favorite band, i think its because not a lot of people have heard of them so i'm not constantly hearing about them. When the Chinese album came out i had to get it and sure enough it was just as good as resident alien, but for the most part i think that anyone who doesn't like even a little of their music is insane, well that's all i can say right now, except try to like their music even if u don't like it at first give it a few more chances, a band like this doesn't come every day u know."
3,"Fun Music, not to be taken seriously?","I ordered this CD because I liked the first song, ""In The Meantime,"" which is a really nice good song, and the others are good, also - just fun music. Track # 5, they could have kept off."
3,Pigs in spaaaaaaace.,"Though I'm sure they're mostly thought of as a one-hit-wonder, man what a hit. ""In The Meantime"" has got to be one of the coolest songs of the mid-90's. After that the songs aren't as good, but still similar, and mostly interesting. Actually I think ""Cruel To Be Kind"" was a minor hit as well. Their sound is definitely retro-glam, like a ""David Bowie"" or ""Elton John"" influenced 90's alt-rock band. By now this disc is probably in every used store across the country, and well worth the price you could get it for. After a few listens, you'll realize ""Space Is The Place""."
3,Cool Its The Song From That Car Commercial...,"""In The Meantime"" is the best song on this album and that is the only reason as to why I bought it. Just set it on repeat and it goes on for hours and hours."
1,Lousy then......worse now!!,"Had the misfortune to see this pathetic group of rockstar wannabees live at an all day event years ago. Spacehog headlined on the strength of that mediocre hit single but were easily the worst band of the day!!! Oh yeah, this album reeks also!!!"
1,Just another rock CD,I can't say too many good things about this band. It's really just another shrinkwrapped rock band to come out during the '90s. They're just another band to ride the wave of popularity. Originality was thrown out the window with this band.
1,Don't judge an album by its single.,In the Meantime was a big hit and I thought it was a great song. I bought this album for that song. I listened to it several times but each time the rest of the music got worse and worse. This is the only album I have ever given away. It is awful. DO NOT BUY THIS RECORD. If you like the single then buy the single. This band should not be encouraged.
1,END IT!,This cd is a horrible joke on humanity. I would rather sit in utter silence than listen to this tripe.
5,This band doesnt get enough attention...,"This is an overall excellent album. Hits like ""In the Meantime"", ""Space is the place"", and ""cruel to be kind"" will get you adddicted. And this album has the quality of all greats - all the non-hits are incredible songs also. They have a trademark Brit-pop influence to them in the melodies and especially in the vocals. They have mastered the art of chromatic melodies which is very rare. There is not one track on this album not worth listening to. I have every song downloaded onto my computer, just like the Smashing Pumpkins album Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness. I also highly reccomend that."
1,Awful,"I own everything Jimmie Dale Gilmore has ever put out, even the Flatlanders, and this is the only let-down. From preachy, full-of-himself lyrics to misguided, overblown production, this is awful. The one or two decent songs are hopelessly outbalanced by the rest of the album. Must to avoid."
1,Not good,"Within the first 5 minutes of using this scale, I realized that it wasn't good. My weight turned up between 105-112 lbs on my first few weighings (I weigh over 150). Maybe this was a defective piece, I did see other reviewers with positive feedback. However, am returning this one immediately and searching for a new one."
1,WW scale,"This thing is terrible and I am surprised that Weight Watchers put their name on it. Every time we step on it, the number changes. We have shown a gain of three pounds in a day, lost two pounds in a day, added three more pounds the next day and a gain of 7 in two days. All of this was by people who did not show these same results on other scales (including those at the local fitness club)."
1,Most Inaccurate Scale I've Ever Used,"The first morning after buying this scale I weighed myself repeatedly a few times just to try it out and get used to how it worked. At first, it showed my weight about 6 lbs lower than I know it to be, then it started showing my weight 5 lbs heavier than the first few readings. This level of inaccuracy is unacceptable to me so I'll be returning the scale."
1,How to gain 5 pounds overnight,"At first I was very pleased with the scale and was using it consistently to watch my weight. I've had it just about a month, and according to it, I literally gained 5 lbs overnight. Tried it later in the day without eating anything and it has me gaining an additional pound!"
4,Perfect for travel!,I am trying to lose 75 pounds and daily weigh-ins are imperative. A scheduled business trip freaked me out but this light-weight scale helped me stay on target and I even lost a pound when I was in Las Vegas!
1,Just doesn't last,The scale quit weighing correctly after less than a year of use. It's not worth the money.
1,piece of junk,I used the scale for several months and thought it was great. Moved it into the living room on a hard wood floor and it read 10.4 lbs . Changed the battery and it still read 10.4 lbs.It will not reset and it is on a flat level surface.It is now in the trash without the new battery that reads 3.2 volts.Another product made in CHINA. Price is not everything.
4,Light!,"Delivery was prompt. Very nice and light scale. Great for moving around and using in a lot of places, exactly what I need it for. This is the second time I purchase the same scale (for different people)."
1,Worked for one month,Purchased November 20th. Stopped working December 21st. Was used once a day. This is the last digital scale I will purchase; my next purchase will be mechanical.LATER: Replaced the battery and now it is working again. Two successive weighings will differ by as much as a pound.
1,This scale dies easily,"I have had this product 2x now, and both have died. If it gets even slightly wet it can kill it. The first time it died while I was cleaning it with a wet sponge. I sent my hubby out to get another scale, didn't tell him which kind to get, and he came back with the same one! The second one died a week ago, only 4 months old, this time the floor was slightly damp underneath (it's in the bathroom) and killed it. I advice trying to get a scale that is a bit more water resistant if you are going to use it in the bathroom."
1,This scale is a piece of #$%^,I have no idea what i weigh because the thing changes eveytime you move it. This is very discouraging when you work out 6 days a week. One day i would get on and be thrilled and the next i would want to slit my wrists. Finally after week 3...duh me.. i moved it around and all 4 times i weighed something different. Spend the extra money and get a nice scale.
1,Very unhappy!,"I am extremely frustrated with this scale. Depending on where I place this scale on my TILED bathroom floor, my weight will fluctuate 5 pounds or more. I too am doing the Weight Watchers diet and every pound counts for me. I would not recommend this scale to anyone!"
1,Weight changes 2 - 3 pounds within seconds,"I purchased this scale a week ago. It's going back to the store today. Without moving the scale, and being sure to place my feet in the exact location on the scale each time, I got four different readings in four tries. The scale was on a tile bathroom floor. Back to mechanical scales for me."
2,Not what I expected,The only positive thing I can say about this scale is it weighs in 10ths of pounds. But the scale itself is cheaply made. The digital number display is hard to read.
2,"Update on ""Better readings from a Magic 8 Ball""","Update: I replaced the Weight Watcher's scale the highly regarded $54 Tanita scale. Surprisingly, it gives the same initial reading as the el cheapo Weight Watchers scale. Neither scale can discriminate incremental weight change when I step back on the scale with a 1, 2, or 3 pound workout weight but the Tanita is considerably less inaccurate for this test. All said, I feel better relying on the Tanita.This thing is driving me nuts. Once it anchors a reading it won't budge from that number regardless of drinking 16 oz. of water (1 lb) or the reverse. I tried measuring its accuracy with a 10 lb plate in my arms. It was off by .2 lbs. That translates into an error of 2 lb per hundred pound of body weight. That's pretty much useless for self-motivation. With a 25 lb plat in my arms, it was off by .6 lbs or 2.4 lbs per 100 lbs. of body weight. Maybe I should get one of those carnival machines."
1,Waste of money,"This scale is a piece of junk. Just to test it out, I weighed my self back to back within 1 minute and I gained 11 lbs. in a minute. This scale was a total waste of my money."
3,"Useful, but not perfectly consistent","I use it to make sure I stay in a range - but if I were a serious weight watcher [holding his/her breath every time he/she steps on the scale hoping that latest pound has disappeared], I would find this scale depressing. It shows a different weight every time, even if you weigh yourself twice in a minute. It can be off by a pound or more. Still, I use it every day and it has been good enough for my needs."
1,Think twice before buying this item,"I find it hard to believe that Weight Watchers has put their name on this item. This scale is very inconsistent and will give you a different reading every time you step on it. I do use it on a flat, wood floor as recommended, but it can differ by several pounds every time you step on it. I also bought my daughter this scale the same time as I bought mine, and hers does the same thing too so I know mines not just a faulty scale. Think twice about purchasing this item, it's one of the worst things I've ever purchased."
1,"Lol, never reviewed a scale before, but this was horrid!","I love this scale because when I went for my physical I was way less than I thought. This scale will vary randomly in weight by massive amounts. I gained a pund and a half bywalking around doing chores for four hours with out even water. I picked up my cat who is rather big and lost a pound. Now the scale seems to pick one weight and stick with it for long periods of time. If you try to reset it the scale picks random weights. This would be a great scale for a person on a calorie diet...you would never know if you were losing pounds or not. This is a bad scale for just having, because I have wasted so much of my time doing fun little experiments to see what it will do next. I even wrote this review. I should have returned this when I got it, but I never used it enough to realize the problem until the physical for a job showed my scale was off by ten pounds or so (turns out the best diet is using a scale that works)."
3,"CD OK, case was cracked",I purchased the CD Ray Brown Trio Live at Scullers. The CD seems to be in good shape but the plastic disk case was cracked when it arrived.
3,Nice socks,These sock were okay but not as great as a different brand I bought. These are nice for anyone who just wants nice socks and doesn't NEED really good padding.
3,Difficult,"My son just turned 4 and we love to play games. He has mastered most games we have (and we have a bunch), but for some reason he struggles with this one."
3,"A novel approach, but really useful?","Beginning a English word with the corresponding kanji is a novel approach. It will help one to remember the meaning, but not the character readings, which is the real challenge. This book does not address this problem.A word of warning: this book uses ROMAJI for the readings. I do not understand why so many kanji books use romaji. If one wants to learn kanji, surely one can read katakana and hiragana. Romaji is an unnecessary distraction."
4,Pretty amazing,"This book is light-years past most other books trying to teach kanji.While romaji is used for the readings, this is not really a problem.Some folks worry about copulas...these are present and more comprehensive than many of the other books and flash card sets I have.Flip through a copy. You will probably like it."
3,Shoot the piano player,"This video should be titled ""An Evening with Gerald Moore (accompanied by Victoria de los Angeles)."" In the patronizing manner that seems to be congenital among a certain class of Englishmen, this prig comments endlessly and condescendingly on every song, and once in a while gives the singer a chance to sing. He also has that charming English habit of Anglicizing every foreign word to such a degree that he can't even pronounce the names of the composers or that of de los Angeles's husband correctly (though he claims that ""ENrique"" is a dear old friend of his). Well, the singing is wonderful, of course, if you can stand HIM (or better yet, keep your finger on the fast-forward button). But this insufferable snob ruined the video for me."
5,Good Stuff,"Good stuff,GREAT Price...Couldn't believe it, normally $6-$7 for 3 oz at any sporting goods store..."
5,Linseed oil perfected,"While designed for finishing gun stocks, Tru-Oil is a perfect complement to any wood surface. I use it to refinish table tops and cabinets which have been scratched, marred or simply grown dull from exposure to sunlight. It is easy to apply and dries quickly (about two hours). It dries to a high gloss, but can easily be reduced to a satin finish by light buffing with XXXX grade steel wool. You do not have to remove the old finish (except for wax polish); it can be applied right over lacquer or varnish."
4,First time use of Tru-Oil,"I found applying the product with an old sock or cotton glove liner works best. No runs and the coverage was very even. Two coats and I had the finish I was looking for; semi-gloss, sealed yet thin enough to still feel the wood grain."
5,Good product,This is a quality product a little goes a long way make sure you use something that does not shed. In the end I used my fingers.
2,"Not impressed, compared to Z-trips other work.","I have almost every cut that Z-trip has been on, I have literally thousands of vinyl records, and I used to have an active interest in turntableism and DJing. Z-trip has always impressed me with his creativity (especially using some very unusual tracks in his mixes), however this album doesn't do it for me. It sounds more like a hip-hop/rap album with a lot of famous names and bad music. You be the judge, but this is nothing like his previous album."
5,5 - Star Performance,"There isn't enough you can say about Jacques Loussier as well as his drummer or bassist. Together and by themselves, they all have amazing rythym. It is unfortunate that Loussier is so unknown. I, myself am not a very big fan of Bach, but Loussier makes me listen! The beat and the Trio's jazz genious make this album well-worth purchasing. Enjoy!"
2,Are these new?,"I have had the headset to use not even two weeks and already it makes a buzzing noise making it impossible to hear anything. Not Happy, I had better luck with the ones I purchased at Best Buy. I will now have to send them in for the warranty at an additional cost."
3,A little heavy,The Jensen Hands Free headset does the job. Good sound but it is a little heavy and hard to keep in your ear close enough to be comfortable. It always feels like its about to fall off.Its a good set for the price and I use it every day. Not bad but the fit could be better.
3,Doesn't work with iPhone,"This is probably my bad for not checking more carefully, but I guess cell phone headphone jacks are not universal. This headset plug doesn't fit in my iPhone (3GS)."
3,Great if it lasted,I love everything about this product except after about 6 months it gets a short in the wite and starts cutting out. The last time it did it I could hear the person i was talking to but they could not hear me. This is the third headset i have had like this with this issue. Other than that great product. I love the over the ear design. It fits me perfectly and the sound quality on my iPhone and cordless phone is very good.
3,Jensen Hands Free Headset,"The purchase and shipment was fine. But the design of the ear holder didn't work very well for my ear. It was hard to get into the right position so that it would stay in. I might work for a person that leaves it on their ear for long periods of time, but not so great for an on and off use.The sound and volume were fine."
4,Pretty good. Worth the money,"I replaced my headset Earbuds with these. I hate Earbuds cause they always fall out my ear. That's so annoying, so I was looking for something more secure on my Ear. This is fairly secure. It feels like it'll fall off when I'm running/jogging, but it doesn't (I don't know how I feel about that). The stick or whatever you call it that the Mic is on is extremely firm. I'm not even sure if it was meant to be bent. It matches my phone (Black), so that's good. It's a MAJOR improvement over my Earbud Headset. I hate Earbuds so much!I saw another Headset that looks a lot better & sleeker than this, but the reviews for it wasn't good at all, so I decided on getting this one."
4,good enough,"I am pretty picky about headsets. Many are not loud enough for me, or have poor sound quality, or have poor quality mics. Jensen stuff seems pretty solid as a rule, and this is no exception. It's small enough that I can easily carry it at all times in my man-purse(I am not one of those ""wear my headset at all times"" guys). My only issue with it is that it's a little loose on my ear, and I do agree with other reviewers that people with large, floppy ears would have great success with the fit of this."
3,get what you pay for,"Sound quality -- averageEase of use -- above averageDurability -- poor.I beat on this headset, so my expectations are in line with results. I think it's a fair enough price that I'm going to purchase number two."
2,Need big ears to operate,"Initially when I looked at this product there was some concern in reviews that the earpiece does not fit snugly. Boy was that an understatement. I'm a big man and it didn't even come close on my head. The sound quality is great, as described. But it does not fit snugly on your head. You almost have to hold it, which to me defeats the purpose of having an earpiece in the first place."
1,Waste of Money!!,DOnt buy and I had tough time in adjusting the ear piece as it falls out every time you hang it over the ear..
4,Does the Job!,"Replaced same model. That one lasted for 3 years where I use it in my phone-based business. Clients report good sound quality, and I can hear them well. I can adjust the volume on my phone base if need be. Have previously used very expensive models and returned them or they just sat in the drawer. This works and it's cheap enough to buy a couple at a time."
5,Worth the money,"-Comfortable,nice ear attachment-Good audio through ear piece-I'm told that the mic sounds ""very good"".-Good value-Quality construction-Durable"
4,One Way Ticket to Moscow,"The book was an exciting page-turner and gave an updated and new view of the current situation in Moscow. It is a far cry from the Soviet stereotype of years past. Life in Moscow seems like the wild, wild west and the adventures of the characters demonstrate the new rules of the game, or lack of. One Way Ticket to Moscow is a fun and fast read."
3,great for history lovers,"This is a story about Alfred the Great.While I'm not clear on how factual everything is, as a person who loves European history, this story was very good at describing the times and drawing the reader in.That said, it was equally a romance. Rather than a dramatic love story based on looks or circumstances beyond their control, it portrayed two people who really seemed to choose each other and were made for each other. Or less romantically, they had synergy.The take-charge tomboy was a perfect backup for the hero with big dreams and ambitions plagued by somewhat ill health (migraines and stomach problems - 0 for romance, 10 for realism.) The forward thinking hero was the perfect husband for a woman who wanted freedom and r-e-s-p-e-c-t from her partner. Each felt that they had gained exactly what they needed in a partner.If you are looking for more drama, this will probably bore you. For those who want history and a gentle romance, this is a winner."
3,"good book, lousy copy","I like this book, it's a good read, but the copy I got from the used bookseller was not as described. It had a page torn out and splatters over the pages, creases and tears on the front and back covers as well as creases in the spine and was described as a good copy. Be cautious about who you but from, having a bad copy decreases enjoyment of the book and focuses you attention more on the process of reading and the physicality and prevents you from being emersed in the Anglo-Saxon world of the setting."
1,Smoked: A true story about the kids next door.,"I think this book is a travesty. Not only have I read it, but I lived it. All the people in this book, I knew. And more precisely, Kathy Macaulay and Heather Goodwin were my friends for many years. Ms. Bing makes Dave out to be some sort of victim, when he is nothing but a cold blooded killer. The book was writen just from his point, becuase obviously, the girls no longer have the opportunity to speak for themselves. If Ms. Bing has a ""investigating detective's assertion"", then I thank God she doesn't work for a police department. She needs to get all the facts before she writes a book again, it only hurts people when she doesn't."
1,"A little note of truth, threw the lies","Not only is this book based on lies and deception, but it is completly miss leading. Leon Bing's information was distorted and minipulated to suite her own needs. She took actual quotes and instences and completley changed them from the truth. I know this becuase I was one of her mian interviewies. What happened was a horrific tragedy and still is. I have thought about it everyday. It has and still hurts my life in more ways than I can count. I was friends with everyone involved. But the fact that Leon Bing has gotten away with passing off this B.S. of a book as truth, is a tragedy of its own. If you call giving 16 year old kids beers, pizza, and money for pot good investigative reporting, than the media and writers of our society and our society as a whole is further in the trash than any of us could know. Please don't waste your money on these lies! If you want some truth about what happened feel free to e-mail me at madchef02@yahoo.com"
1,Do Not Buy This TV!,"Multiple problems have been discovered with this tv, and if you purchase one, chances are you will discover them soon. Problems include: picture changing from color to black and white; no reception that requires you to uplug the tv; tv turning itself off, and other times not turning off at all; color parameters only reflecting reds and greens; and several others. For more real reviews visit Cuircut City site. My unit is currently being serviced after 6 weeks from purchase. Do yourself a favor and do not buy this tv."
1,Poor power supply,"We've had two problems with our set, both ever since it came out of the box on Oct 25,2001.First, the power supply has a nasty hum which makes listening difficult at low volume levels. Since this set was bought for the bedroom, and is often used after the kids have gone to sleep, we often have the volume set low (around ""six""). At this level there is a very noticeable 60Hz hum, making it hard to hear the words. You'll never notice this if there is background noise, like at a store or a service shop, but you sure will in a quiet house!!Also, ours likes to turn itself back on about 2 seconds after you shut it off, sometimes takes 5+ tries to shut it off.Our set has been in for service three times for these problems(a total of 55 days in service so far). Panasonic Customer Service is unwilling to help in any way.Summary - for a low price set, I'd buy something else."
1,"Won't turn off, Service locations few and far between","We are having the same problem as many others -- the set won't stay turned off. It seems to get worse over time. It was a mere occasional annoyance at first, but now is a real problem. Plus Panasonic requires us to travel about 20 miles to a repair facility (in a major metro area - Wash DC!). Hardly seems worth it! We will try a different remote as suggested by another reviewer, but if that doesn't work I think we'll have to buy a new set."
4,"Good TV, fixes for some problems","I haven't had the picture quality problems others have described with this TV, but I have had the turn-itself-back-on-after-turning-it-off problem happen. A combination of a different remote control (the one that Panasonic includes is really not that great) and adhering paper cutout devil horns (seriously, it works!) keeps the TV off when it's supposed to stay off. Generally, most people experience that problem when turning the TV off from the remote, so it's really the remote's fault. Otherwise, it's a decent, relatively lightweight, good looking TV with nice features. Admittedly, I wish I had bought a Sony, but this is a great runner-up for a very decent price."
2,Mixed review,"I do like that the case covers the screen and it slides well, but it's so hard to open the flap to charge it, that I usually take it off. I also have to take it off to use headphones because the case gets in the way of the plug adapter. I did drop my phone a few times and each time the case came off. I haven't been able to find the perfect case for the Chocolate."
3,"Effective, but bulkier than anticipated","I ordered this product because the back support that I was using previously was very stiff in the front and consequently ""stuck out"", making it nearly impossible to wear undetected under my clothing. From the description, the ""Cincher"" sounded like it was mesh material and so I thought it would be less stiff and cooler. It is not. But it is VERY WELL MADE. No doubt about that. And I can wear it under a loose fitting top and the front does not stick out. But it is heavier material than I expected and if I'm doing cleaning or any physical activity, it does tend to make me quite warm. So, while I'm impressed with the quality of the product, it still isn't the perfect solution for me."
4,"Somewhat entertaining, but not like their movies.","For Abbott and Costello fans, this is a great selection to add to your collection. Although I feel it is not as funny or entertaining as their movies, it is still good 50's classic TV. The DVD quality and sound is fantastic!, and so is the packaging.Adam Link"
5,Great entertainment,Loved this set...well worth the money for the many hours of enjoyment...if you're and Abbott n Costello fan...this is a must.
4,additional information to editorial above,"I just wanted to add this to the review above: the 1979 catalog can still be found quite easily, but it contains mostly black and white reproductions of the works. There are only 23 colour images of the more than 400 pages in the 1979 book. The 2000 catalog is almost entirely in colour... However, I cannot properly judge the quality of the reproductions in the latter, as I have not seen one of those amazing paintings in reality yet."
5,Viper SST Remote,This was the perfect spare remote. The wife is brutal on everything as she doesn't take care of any electronic device. I needed to find a spare without paying a fortune. This was perfect.
4,Works Like a Charm,"Needed a replacement for the original remote. I checked locally & found that it was being sold for about $125. I decided to check online at Amazon & was pleasantly surprised that it was selling for about $50 cheaper. Ordered it & received it in a few days. Programming instructions provided were a little confusing, but I did find simpler instructions on the internet. Now it's working perfectly."
3,viper responder sst remote,ordered back in 2009 and still working. easy to setup. the only thing i dont like about the responder sst remote is that i have to change the AAA battery every 3-4 weeks
1,Worst Piece of Crap Ever,"biggest waste of space ever. guitars suck, vocals are hack compared to what he is capable of. overall a worthless effort bought by the drones that call themselves people."
4,good sabbathy metal,"plain and simple this album rocks....if you like pantera, sabbath or other kinds of ""stoner rock"" than you will like this...awesome guitar riffs, great vocals and cool songs all around...only reason it doesn't get a 5/5 is because it is not terribly original, but if you like any of the bands mentioned above, you will dig this release"
5,How Music Should Be!,"Best line-up on an album, ever. Phil Anselmo. Pepper Keenan. Kirk Windstein. Todd Strange. Jimmy Bower. This album takes ages to get into. But once your there you can't get it out of your CD player. I love this album. I can't get enough of it. Its a lot better than Down II. This is, next to Black Sabbath 'Master of reality', one of the best Doom Metal albums of all time. The inlay of the booklet gives you the best feel of the album. 5 dudes hanging around in the sun, making some kick ass tunes. New Orleans swamp metal. Chemically-depressed Stoner Rock. Doom. This band started off making some underground tapes. But beccause they were so good, they went on to make a great album. This is some very heavy guitar riffs with some mellow acoustic songs. Please check out this cd. Its so good."
5,One of the best heavy alblums ever,I listen to a wide vareity of music in the mid nineties i was really into metal i have since ventured into many different genres and have an appreciation for all music ... however if i want to listen to some kick ass sabbath influenced sh*t this is the territory that i roam stone the crow has to be one of the best songs ever written in my opinion. anyone who appreciates a good solid riff will dig this alblum
5,What can I say? It`s prefect....,"This is a perfect album, all of the songs are really, really good! Phil is at the top of his game, so is pepper, kirk and jim, it all sums up to one of the best metalalbums ever recorded!!!Check out Down II and Down III"
4,unsettling film by Brillante Mendoza,I like Brillante Mendoza films because of their realism. His films pull back the curtain on a side of the Philippines that most would not want the world to see.I remember watching a news story from the Philippines last year about police raiding a theater such as the one depicted in this story. The setting for the movie is an old movie house that has seen better days.The owner is on the verge of bankruptcy and the once large movie house (that is the setting for this story) is deteriorating. The only thing keeping the place open is the owner's ability to borrow money.The main customers are gays and call boys who use the theater for anonymous sexual rendevous.
1,Service,Story was not great. Video quality and sound quality was okay. The whole video was was poorly presented. Could not a figure out of the rating if it X or R....
2,Doesnt close tight.,The seal doesn't seem to have a tight close on it meaning it will lose humidity quickly. Good size for the money but your Gurkha is going to smoke like a Quorum.
5,A fun nostalgic sine for the Man cave.,These signs are of good quality and craftsmanship. Guest have a great time reading the signs and I have always receive good comments about them. Most ask if they are original.I own several and plan on buying more from this manufacturer.
5,Music to my ears,This is like a little slice of heaven on earth. When I am down I like to listen to this to lift me up!
3,Great song list,"The song list on the cartidge was great, but it is a typical Leadsinger catridge, the songs are somewhat off key. Fun product, recommended for people who don't care much about the quality of the songs."
2,2-DAY SHIPPING TURNED TO 3 WEEKS SHIPPING,I still have not received this package. I ordered it last month and paid for two day delivery. I received an e-mail apologizing for the long wait and that the dates of delivery had changed. But I guess that doesnt refund the extra money I paid for it to be shipped faster.
2,Have not read the book,"I will admit upfront that I have not read nor will I read this book. But let me say this about R.C. Sproul.He's a smart man with a good deal of natural intelligence but in many ways he has wasted his life by supporting a dying cause - Calvinism.The Reformed and Presbyterian denominations in the U.S. are dying, and indeed are on their deathbed, and all of Sproul's intelligence cannot nor will it change the reality of this dying heresy.Calvin was wrong from the beginning and Sproul was wrong to take his God-given mind and use it to try to prop up Calvinism.I will say again, Calvin was wrong from the start. The Holy Spirit is nowhere present in the writings of Calvin anymore than He is present in the writings of Sproul because the Holy Spirit is not the Spirit of division and untruth.What a terrible waste, but this is what happens when your father in the faith is not Jesus Christ but John Calvin."
1,Contemporary Advertising with PowerWeb and CD-ROM,"It would be nice if the glossary on the CD-ROM went along with the book - makes learning confusing. It would also be nice if ther was a uniform code of terms that went along with my other marketing classes. I had to ask my teacher what we were going by - the book or the CD-ROM terms - teacher says to forget the CD-ROM - also, I bought it used so I didn't recieve the card with details on how to get into the website."
4,Works well,"This is one of the few headsets that reliably works with a number of different phone, and produces clear sound for both you and the person on the other end of the line. We've tried a number of others that don't work nearly as well. It's comfortable enough to wear for long conversation.In our house they hold up for about a year or two of constant use before they fail (usually the cord wears out)."
2,ideal for deaf bald people who wear glasses,"*Just bought, and overpaid at BestBuy at $26!*The ear piece is so loud that I have to keep it on my cheek to avoid pain, even at my phone's lowest volume setting.*The T-shaped headband end gets tangled in my long hair, but I can't buy over-the-ear as I wear glasses.It was still $4 cheaper than a similar brand/model at Radio Shack, and I had the same complaints about that one too, until the ear piece broke off.This is what I get for not shopping at Amazon first, and at least saving money! Think I'll buy Amazon stock.Now to go look for cotton to stuff in the ear piece."
1,Jensen JTH940 - BAD WIRE,"This was an Open Box purchase. Probably was returned because it was defective. Sound was very scratchy when plugged in. The molding on plug prevented it from fully inserting into the cell phone jack (LG 220C flip phone).I trimmed the molding (which made the headset non-returnable) and discovered the the problem is a bad connection within the molded plug. I have read other reviews who had the same problem after a few months.When the sound worked, the ear phone was great. The ear cushion was comfortable.Never got a chance to test the microphone.I liked the sound well enough that I plan to replace the plug to get it to work.Plan on replacing this headset every few months due to defective wiring."
1,Crap,I had to return the first set I got. The next pair doesn't work now ether. The microphone part quits working.
2,No windscreen,The picture shows a microphone with a windscreen. The problem is that breath noise is terrible. Would probably be quite nice with a wind shield.
4,Works with Uniden Cordless phones,This headset works flawlessly with our Uniden TRU 9488 phones. Sound quality both ways is very good. We use it for conference calls and simultaneous keyboard use. Construction seems light but it will not get heavy use and we'll handle it with care.
3,Great Headset.. while it lasted,"Of all the headsets and ear pieces I have tried, this one was by far the favorite of those I speak with on my cell phone. They reported great sound quality coming from me. I could hear them very well also. If I could end the review now I would give 5-stars without hesitation. Especially when you consider the low price, this headset beat others that were much more expensive. Now for the negative: the headset broke prematurely after only 3 months of service. One cold day I went to put it on and part of it snapped in two. It was about 25 degrees.. consumer grade plastics should not snap at those temperatures."
3,lasted one year - shorted out,"My earpiece lasted about one year. The retractible feature is not as handy as it appears. The cord is too thin, and even with gentle use, it shorted out quicker than cheaper ear buds that I've owned."
4,Great for the Windy City,"I've owned 4 handsfree units - none of them worked well in the wind until this one. The microphone works even when the wind blows hard off Lake Michigan. The sound in the ear piece is fantastic, very clear; I don't have to have the volume up full blast to hear. I've had no complaints from callers, they can hear me perfectly well.I have two problems, minor, with the device. 1) The cord between the ear piece and the microphone is too short. 2) Sometimes if the ear piece isn't positioned correctly, it hurts my lobe.Overall I love this and have been using it for well over a month. This particular model DOES NOT come with the optional voice activation/disengage call button. Some phone models are too old to function properly with that added feature (so I found out when I spent the extra $10 to buy one at the Verizon store), but they'll work just fine with this ""basic"" model."
1,This things sucks,"Let me tell you, the concept was better then I could have imagined. It fit into my pocket with my cell without wires getting all tangled up.HOWEVER, I was in my car and snagged it on my seatbelt, oh so slightly, and the retractable device broke into a million pieces. I didn't even own it for 2 hours before I had to throw it away.And the delivery was the worst. I ordered it in September and received it in December. They didn't even contact me to let me know it was being delayed. I almost forgot if I had ordered it or not. My opinion, spend the extra few dollars and get a Bluetooth, at least you don't have to worry it is going to break into a million pieces."
3,Worked Okay,You can still tell the scratch is there put it covered it up okay. My dumb fault for what I did to scratch my AR though. Worked okay to fix the scratches on my lower. I would use it again though. Just has a little but of a sheen still but looks better than a scratch.
2,Didn't Like,"Don't like this item. It doesn't blend in scratches rather covers them up. Problem with that is once applied the ink can't be wiped to smooth out, causing an unlevel spot on the gun. If ink is wiped it comes completely off or roughens. Better off using a Sharpie."
5,Excellent Product,Excellent for firearm scratch touch-up. Must be sure to clean all gun oil from barrel. Very opaque. I noticed no variation in the anti-reflective factory coating after application. I would highly recommend this product.
2,Rubbs off.,"The pen does cover well and matches the matt black finish on 'tactical' weapons. It does, however, rub off easily which makes the product all but useless."
4,"Matches the paint on my Sigma lens, but not so permanent","I bought this touch up pen for some nicks on one of my Sigma lenses, and it's a solid match with that finish. I also figured I'd get some more use of of this by touching up my eyeglasses, which have a black paint baked on titanium. The original eyeglass finish was more of a semi-gloss, so it could never be a direct match (this pen is rather flat), but it was better than unpainted titanium. Alas it wasn't that durable in this use, and the touch up paint comes off quite easily. The upside of this was it was easy to get back to where I started, but still not a success. The nicks on my lens has held up better, but they weren't on such a challenging location. Since the pen did the trick for what I bought it for, I guess it's still worth four stars."
4,Great pen,"Works like a charm! Highly recommended if you build your own AR15. Only reason for 4 star is the cap seal, instruction says to install tight to keep from drying which make absolute sense. However, how tight is tight? Need a torque wrench? Plastic cap on aluminum body = easy to strip the plastic cap end! I just put it in a plastic zip lock bag after putting on the cap."
3,Technical review,"First let me state the purpose of my purchase. I needed to touch up the finish on my Sig P229 slide. It has a dark grey nitron finish and I was hoping to cover some scratches. This paint is truly flat, but in my opinion not suitable for guns. It is pure black, therefore can't completely blend with a grey finished guns. The gun begins to look like a toy and you can tell right away where the fixed spot is. Another issue is that this paint wears off very easily. I would consider using it only on surfaces that will not be touched later on. I degreased the slide with alcohol, then applied thin layer of paint, let it dry for couple of hours. Yet the paint was wearing off by GENTLY rubbing the slide with my fingers.So my conclusion is: this product is not suitable for touching up guns as a long term solution. You can use it on something you're planning to put on a shelf and just look at it."
5,Birchwood Casey Super Black,This touch up works great! the flat black works well for scratches and places where anodizing or bluing has worn off. I rubbed my finger over the part I had painted when it had dried and you can barely tell where I painted it.
4,"Covers up, looks like matte-black pen","This does a decent job, but I'm not sure that it's better than BC Aluminum Black.You can tell it's on there. I think I'd almost rather live with the character you get from actually using your firearm.That being said, if you've got a big SHINY ding in your weapon, this will mask it. USE SPARINGLY.Recommended."
1,Beware of CLP.,Used it on my AR15 and Sig Sauer Nitron finish due to some minor scratches here and there. Breakfree CLP just took it off like it was dirt. Lets just say I am very disappointed in this product and yes I degreased the parts and allowed the paint to cure for a couple of days and the CLP still took it off.
3,Not working for me.,"I purchased this paint on the hope I could cover a scratch on a Nitron coated pistol. The scratch is on a nasty place along a sharp edge. Although the paint covers well and the flat finish blends in perfectly with the black Nitron finish, the paint dries and will wipe right off. Cleaning the spot of any oil did not make a differance. I'll find other uses for this product, but doesn't work for the initial purpose."
2,not as expected,"I got mixed reviews on this product and decided to take a chance. The product arrived one day than expected which was great. However, once I applied the product to my lower reciever I noticed the color change as it dried to an ashy black almost dark gray. Since I only had minor nicks and scratches on my ar the end result was fine. The paint does rub off so keep that in mind if you decide to purchase."
2,Troubles,"Goes on easy and dries really nice black, and blends in well. Problem is, when you clean the gun, OR oil it, this paint comes right off."
4,Good Country Rock,"This is my first Big & Rich album. I bought it for ""Save A Horse"" which is fun and rockin'. But, I found several other songs on the album I really enjoyed. The slower ballad, ""Drinkin' 'Bout You"" is also a standout."
5,Great album!,"One of the few albums I know of in any genre by any artist from which I can listen to all of the songs. Most albums have a few good songs on them and a bunch of filler. There is NO filler on this album. I am also impressed by their adeptness at playing everything from rock to more traditionally twangy country to blues to hip-hop. Also, the tone of the songs range from funny to dead-serious."
5,Great Album!,"Excellent debut album that shows a great diversity in musical ability, as well as a rarely seen intelligence added to some of their more playful songs. One thing is very clear. These guys really have fun doing their job, and it's evident in nearly every song."
5,Big & Rich rock!,"They are white trash good ole boys who can sure create a festive mood on cd! Any one who can get themselves kicked out of a wimp band like Lonestar (as John Rich did) is all right by me. And Big Kenny is 40 years old just like me! Pretty old to be releasing his first album, but hey, Brooks & Dunn are both well over 50 and no one has gotten rid of them yet. I'm not very big and I'll never be rich, but I sure love this cd. All of the songs are great, not just Wild West Show and Save A Horse, Ride A Cowboy."
5,This should be the new country,I am born and bred in NYC. Always hated country music growing up. Thought it was the typical my dog shot my wife and drove off in my pickup with my last beer. Recently got into Johnny Cash and WIllie nelson and was introduced to Big and Rich. All I can say is they are great. Not quite country not quite rock and roll (almost like the Osmonds). They are the future of country music and if people are smart popular music.
1,Pure 100% crap,These two bozos along with Gretchen and Cowboy Troy aint gonna last. This muzic mafia and love everybody crap is all fake and made up by the corporate nashville people. They are all big fakes. Trust me in a year or two they will all be has beens and cowboy troy will be back to selling shoes at footlocker. LOL. And could somebody please tell me how this junk is country?? It sound more like rock or rap to me. If you think you can explain to me how this muzic mafia big and rich crap is country please let me know by emailing me at: countrymusicfan19@comcast.net Thanks
2,You all are pathetic,"This is not country. Big deal, get over it. Just because CMT, which is a network run by sellouts anyway, shows their video does not make this country. There is a guy rapping in spanish in some songs! And he (...). My 12 year old brother can freestyle better than he can rap. That's besides the point. If they didn't have that lame rapper in some of the songs, this could be an ok album. And what the heck is wrong with Tim McGraw? Last time I checked, he has made better ""country"" music than these clowns. At least he doesn't have spanish rapping black hicks on his records, which is absurd. This is not a breath of fresh air into the country music world, it's just more music from the trailer park like Kid Rock. Kick My A$$ is a good songs until it gets ruined at the end as well. Everybody who thinks this is actual good music is a moron. It's catchy, but bad."
2,Brooks & Dunn Redux,"Having heard Big & Rich rave reviews, I purchased their album. After giving their music a good listen, it's just another attempt by the Nashville Music Row to shove more of the same down our throats through radio. I own Brooks & Dunn, Montgomery Gentry, so Big & Rich is more of the same. Nashville record labels shell out big dollars to have their tripe played repeatedly on country radio. Generally, more impressions mean more album sales. Overall, I am disappointed."
1,awful!!!,Big & Rich seem to be doing pretty good in the country business but for those who enjoy real country would say these guys are not country and they are awful. If you watched the awards show you would see that they had cheerleaders with mini-mini skirts and that is NOT country. Would you see Alan Jackson or George Strait with cheerleaders? NO. Because they are country and Big & Rich are not.
1,0 stars wasn't a rating,"This is a worthless CD. I don't care how many people tell me this is country, I'm not buying their opinions. These guys are terrible. The lyrics sound like rap with a twangy as beat. Some people may call this country, but this isn't my country music."
2,lighten up,"The only use I have for musical genres, styles, traditions, etc. is to have some idea of what to expect when I listen to the radio. Beyond that, the whole system is mere taxonomy. There's really only three kinds of music: music that moves my body, music that moves my mind, and the combination of the two.Big & Rich is decidedly the former. Are they genuine? Are they a 'corporate scheme'? Are they even country? I don't know and I don't care. If you're looking for high art ,groundbreaking music or deep, poignant lyrics, this ain't it. But if it makes you grin, makes you wanna dance, sometimes that's all that matters."
5,Great CD!!!,This is an excellent CD. This is the first CD that I've ever purchased based on only hearing one song on the radio and I wasn't dissappointed! Read the other reviews that describe the music and then buy this CD!!
5,Not your daddy's country,Horse of a Different Color is not your typical country CD. There are songs on it for all sorts of occasions. It has slow songs and it has some fast fun songs. It is the perfect party CD providing a very broad range of emotions. Definitely worthy of being added to any country fan's music collection.FlipperJenkinsThe Freak Parade
5,GREATTTTTTTTTTTTT,"Love them, the cd is so good, these guys have got it right......Love everybody.Barbara"
5,Kicking A$$ and taking names,This is a great album. It proves you don't have to feed into musical stero types. All of the tracks are great and it shows how talented they are. Take a listen to the samples that are on the page. If you like this one you will love the Galactic Fan Pak. I liked this album becasue it gave me a little bit of every kind of music not just what you think country is supposed to be.
5,BIG AND RICH IS THE BEST,"this CD is without a doubt the best purchase of my life. There are so many types of songs on this cd. There are slow, love songs. There are live and uptempo songs. There are true country songs. It is such an awesome cd that it's the only cd that I'll listen to til their next one comes out!!!"
5,ITS AWESOME,"Big Kenny and John Rich have done made the most awesome album to date. When I first listened to it I was blown away. You will want to dance, sing and cry with this album.."
2,Big and Rich-A parody?,"You know, I heard ""Save a Horse"" on the radio and thoughtit was funny. But, I heard my nephew playing this CD andI realized something. This is just another attempt to blenda whole bunch of genres together for the purpose of havinghigh record sales. I don't really surprise me that theseguys have tried to combine modern country rock and rapmusic. Why not? Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit have tried to makerap-rock work for a few years now and it still is prettybad.These days you have rap/rock/country and pop all tryingto feed off each other to create the highest record salesit can. Nevermind, that 90% of mainstream music has turnedinto manufactured rubbish as is the case with this album.I don't know if these guys realize it or not... But they area parody of modern mainstream music. Don't insult rock bycalling this album a rock album."
1,false mall poser music,"The two cuts that have been on the radio are ok. The whole idea of Big and Rich comes off as such a marketing ploy ---- ""Hey, let's do a kid rock thing for country fans"". It's such a bland and unimaginative idea. The other songs on the cd are absolutely horrible --- really amateurish and shallow, I can't believe a major label put it out which is why I think they are just a concept.The two good cuts are just mall music to have videos with girls in tight t shirts and 13 year old sensisbility. Really tired."
1,if you like country this is not for you,"this cd is an insult to country. please show me a REAL country song that says ""wha, wha"" or ""bling blingin"" gimme a break. if you liked save a horse ride a cowboy than you might like this cd but dont say that you like country. i might have to hide my face in shame"
1,What is country music coming to?,"Just horrible.As I sit here listening to an old Dwight Yoakam CD, I wonder what happened to good country music like this.The only reason record producers put out trash like Big & Rich (* or insert pretty much any other popular country music artist here -- Big & Rich, Gretchen Wilson, Toby Keith; whoever you want *) is to cater to the lowest common denominator of music listeners out there. This isn't real country, just pop music with a 'country-like' twang to it. It's an insult to *good* country music.Everytime *REAL* artists make advancements in Country music in an effort to make it more appealing to the general public, something like this comes out and ruins it. One step forward, two steps back. Spare yourself and buy some real country music, not this pop-nonsense."
1,You scared Manson? HA!,"I recently heard one of the dumbest songs ive heard since My Humps. It seems that music is trying to compete by putting out the worst single anyone has ever heard. I thought Hollaback Girl was the worst song ever but then came These Boots are made for walking by Jessica Simpson, then Gretchen Wilsons all jakked up, and now this crappy duo with no talent puts out a song called Coming to your city. I cant review that cd, so i'll just say it hear-IT SUCKS! What is wrong with music today? Songs are getting worse and worse, and people are eating it up like some sloppy fried triple cheeseburger with bacon. Big and Rich have no talent but like any music act in country or pop, they have money. When I heard they rhyme we scared Manson, I was in shock and laughed. The only thing you can scare Manson on is how retarded you guys are, your gimmick is like week old underwear. Musik Mafia can count there billions of dollars, but you guys will never ever have talent."
5,The best CD in a long time!!,"Broaden your horizons and become a Big and Rich fan! This CD will change your life. Each song is beautifully written and sung, and the happy-go-lucky spirit of Big and Rich will positively brighten your day. Check it out!!"
5,Amazing,"Big and Rich are amazing. This is a great cd and you can tell they are enjoying themselves. The Cd is packed with great songs, Save a horse ride a cowboy, big time and of course Holy Water a powerful ballad. I wish I could enjoy my job as much as they seem to.Chris Pierce"
4,Country will never be the same,"Big and Rich have changed country music. Their Kid Rock inspired lyrics and music will change the landscape of country music pre 2004. Country music used to be trapped in rural Southeast. That changed with the record disc. Big and Rich may not have that impact on music and they may not be all original as they owe a great debt to Kid Rock and others, but what they have done has changed the landscape. This CD will be ""Big"" for well into 2005 and beyond. This is an instant classic."
5,The Future is now,"Wow, all I can say is that this cd is amazing. One of the few in a long time that I can put in the player and listen to every song. The sound is refreshing and is really a windows down radio up kind of sound. I love this album. These guys are sure to show everyone what a great country duo can be. If you have a chance to go out and get this album get it. Trust me I'm not one to review things that much but this cd is just so good I want others to know that. They will be amazing in concert too I assume. I'll be glad if this sound is something that continues in country music."
5,Country Music Without Predjeduce,"Big and Rich's debut album is really energetic with a slow blues tone to it. The first song ""Rollin'"" has a black dude rappin' with them named cowboy troy ver good song breaks the rap country barrier. Drinkin about you is a slow blues like song, but the best on the album is deadwood moutain."
3,love it but it gets old,Horse of a different color is a new twist on country music. but even the artists admit that it isnt real country music. its just music that they want to play. the first time i herd the cd i loved it but all their songs sound relativly the same because their voices dont flow it all gets monotonus. and no its not the best thing to come out of nashville. if you want new traditional (real) country music maybe try hank the third??? not big and rich. but im glad i bought the album
3,Sounds Like AEROSMITH to me!,The music on this CD sounds like mid-80's Aerosmith with some banjo and mean slide work added. Not necessarily a bad thing. Even the vocal phrasing is similar to the style of Steven Tyler. Amazing how far rock and roll has come these days. hehe.
5,Well worth purchasing!,"I always liked ""Save the Horse, Ride the Cowboy"" but after hearing the rest of the CD, I am glad I purchased it. Great group of songs!"
4,Searching The Evidence,John Noble Wilford is an excellent science/technology writer and applies his trade to exploring who Columbus really was from the available evidence. It's a well balanced treatise.
5,"from a dog, b. 1970","Reviewer of July 17 , 2001 here again. Failed to read other reviews before writing my own. I have to write in lyricist Wareham's defense. Lyrics are not ""surreal non sequiturs"", as one of the previous reviewers states. I like to think of mention of ""fox"" and ""hedgehog"", in addition to ""fortune cookie"", as reference to finding one's birth year animal (for lack of a better term) on a Chinese resturant placemat. (Although more likely to be reference to theory of Isaiah Berlin.) And ""giving the finger to the blind"" and ""laughing at the deaf"" is brilliant - that's the joke, ..."
3,Velvet Underground redux,"It's no secret that Dean Wareham and Luna get endless inspiration from Lou Reed and the Velvet Underground. ""Penthouse"" is by far the best of their VU inspired grooves. For my money, Dean and Britta Phillips transcend VU and Luna on their side project ""L'Aventtura"" from 2003. Essential Luna albums are ""Penthouse"" and their supposed final album ""Rendezvous"", which finds them morphing into a post Tom Verlaine groove. The rest are hit and miss."
1,Hated it,"I'm sorry, but all the other reviewers must be friends with the band. I thought that the music itself was barely ok, but the vocals were just awful."
5,Gentle and Effective Methods Clearly Explained-- A Winner,"This is an excellent tape. Frost walks the viewer through teaching the basic obedience commands to your dog-- sit, stay, down, heel, and come. Her methods are gentle but effective, and based on positive reinforcement with lots of praise and the occasional treat. Corrections are just that-- a way to show the dog what you want, not a punishment. Frost gives attention to showing viewers how to use equipment such as training collars in a safe and humane way, and is very oriented to teaching dogs good manners (not jumping up on visitors) and safety skills (not leaping out of cars or rushing through doors) essential to comfortable everyday living with a dog."
4,step by step,"This is a step-by-step guide on how to train your dog. The video is well put together and easy to follow. You should have no problem teaching your dog each behavior, because the material is presented in a straightforward fashion.Commands and rewards are explained from the dogs point of view, so there's no guesswork about what should or should not work. Each command is explained and shown, in sequence; this means you can master a command before moving on to the next section of the video.I highly recommend this dog training video to anyone who wants to train a dog. This video should be good for first time dog trainers, and also people who have trained dogs before, and want a few new pointers. We all have something to learn.ken32"
1,No choke chains!,"I totally agree with the reviewer who opposes the use of choke chains. Any trainer who still advocates this method is way behind the times. For that reason alone, I would not buy this video."
1,Dire and leaden,"The is the first Spinrad book I have read for many years, I used to admire his SF short stories in the early to mid seventies, but I was very disappointed by this unimaginative, badly researched and totally unconvincing work. Quite frankly it was embarassing to wade through. Vercingetorix surely deserves better."
1,EXTREMELY DANGEROUS,"I bought this for my mother for her birthday about a year ago, she suffers from really bad fibromyalgia. Upon opening the box i immediately noticed dirt here and there i figured it had prob just sat in the warehouse for some time. Once i began to assemble it it noticed that there was rust on the peg that connects the body to the wheels, this also did not bother me. But once i powered it on it began to melt and the smell of burnt wires or plastic filled the air. At first i though it was just because it was that new smell. WRONG, the longer it stayed on the worse it got. I called the company and asked for refund and sent it back. The rep was cool about it she tried have another sent but i said no way and asked for my money back. I wouldn't risk it if i were you, it was just bad all around."
2,Not a Good Value,"The game itself is okay, but it's so short and there are only three games. That's $10 per game -- maybe a half hours worth. If there were 20 games, and each section was longer, then it might be worth it. I'd play this game again, but I would never purchase it."
1,I don't know if this is good...it locked up my DVD player.,"I have a very expensive universal DVD player (plays any format worldwide)and it caused my system to lock up every time I tried to play it. I don't know if this is an isolated case, but use caution if this item comes back into stock and you want to buy it."
2,Not so great Performance,This mouse is very small & the retractable cable is a really good feature as it avoids tangling with other wires. But the latch of the retractable cable is really weak & mine was broken within the couple of weeks of use. The mouse is working fine till the date(I Purchased about a month ago) I have used other notebook mice before & think that this is not as par with other branded products in the market.
5,Wonderful Book Series,"This book is part of a series of 39 books and involves a group of teenagers who not only have great times together, but look for ways to help others and always manage to find a mystery along the way! I especially like the values which the characters display. They are wonderful role models for today's youth! These books are a timeless treasure!"
2,Gross inaccuracy in a definition,"Definition for ""autarchy"" (lack of government, self-rule) is given as ""autocracy"" (governmental power in the hands of one individual only), which is effectively as near to an antonym, the exact opposite of autarchy, as anything else I can think of.This is not to say that the entire dictionary is wrong. I've looked up about 48 words since I've bought it and only come up with this one mistake. But if the ratio holds true for the rest of this book (1 in 48) then I'm looking forward to about 1458 wrong definitions."
4,An old reading assignment,"This book was written by my tenth grade biology teacher and of course we had to read it for his class. As the title implies, it is an alternative look at aggression resolution that deviates from total nuclear war. Femmer is correct in relating that aggression between two countries can be settled by a mock war with little or no casualties. I just thought that a review of a book that is 1.8 million titles away from number one is fitting."
5,"Great Clips, Great Game Play - Hours of Fun!","After playing Shout About Music I was really looking forward to this new entry in the Shout About DVD trivia game series. Hasbro did not disappoint. In addition to great game play, featuring clip segments, audio puzzles and the like, there are lots of classic and contemporary TV clips here - basically cool stuff for whatever crowd you have gathered to play. Blows Scene It away. Totally recommend this one and looking foward to the next installment."
4,Shout! family fun night,This is a really fun family game. Easy to work on DVD player and if you love movies or tv shows you will have a great time. A friend loaned me the first one and I bought more. Totally fun.
1,ZERO Replay Value,"This game has zero replay value. Once you play the three episodes, you're done. Each run through of each episode is the same. Played through the entire disc in an hour and half. My advice: Spend a few dollars more and get Scene It!"
2,A Marine is NOT a soldier.....,"The beginning of the story was okay and while the rest was kind of readable, it wasn't very good as far as holding my attention. And in my experience with the Marine Corps, a Marine is never referred to as a soldier, he/she is a Marine, and THAT is with an M not m. Sorry to be so picky, but it matters."
3,Unfulfilled Potential,"After reading the first two books in this series, Head over Heels, and Getting Lucky, I couldn't wait for Hot and Bothered to come out. There is something about Susan Andersen's writing style that is so enjoyable and memorable. Her characters are always so likeable. That said, I wish this could be a better review and truly Hot and Bothered isn't a bad book, it just isn't a great book. If I hadn't read the first two in the series, I don't think it would have occurred to me how the author missed the mark but since I did read them, the unfulfilled potential of this book drove me nuts. The dialogue is flat and none of the sex scenes were hot or exciting. I never felt a connection with these characters and I couldn't figure out why Rocket didn't want to know about Tory's pregnancy and Esme's childhood up to the point that he meets her. I think this book suffered from too much attention on Jared and PJ's story and not enough attention on the main story."
1,This book is so boring!!,"Now I am a Susan fan, I have read numerous of her books and I love them. This book was a HUGE disappointment. Even the love scenes couldn't make up for this drag of a book. I could skip big chunks at a time and go back and force myself to read them. This book is a real dud. John is boring, and Victoria is so stiff she isn't likeable to me. The kids were the only interesting part of the book. If you want a good romance, don't read this one, its a real dud."
3,certainly not her best,"While SA is by far one of my favorite authors...this book wasn't as good as some of her earlier works. Esme may have thrown a wrench into the whole plot, thus making the story a bit dull."
2,Did not hold my interest,I usually like Susan Andersen books but this one was very disappointing. I skipped over big parts of the story and really didn't mind that it ended. I liked the hero and I liked the heroine but together they just didn't have any sparks. The book spent way too much time on the younger brother and P.J. and I just completely skipped through those pages. I think it would have been better to have more scenes with the hero and his 5 year old daughter getting to know each other better. I just thought it was overall a pretty boring book.
5,KOKO,BOOK WAS GREAT LOOKED FOR MORE BUT SHE DIDN'T HAVE THEM ON KINDLE YET. WHAT A BUMMER. WILL KEEP LOOKING.
2,Slooooow,"The film is tediously slow. Shots are held to the point where you're going ""well""? There's a kind of dull numbness to the whole thing, relieved only occasionally by a light bit of humor. Sadly, the lead hasn't got the screen presence to carry the film.There cinematography is sometimes pretty, but the framing is sometimes weird. There's a shot through a doorway and the two leads walk out of view as seen through it, but the camera lingers on the empty door for-ever. Some scenes feel like they were done with only two setups, and there's no additional coverage, so we go from a one shot to a another one shot and back to the first. The dinner scene, for instance, where we never see the food...even when one of them supposedly takes a bite.I wanted to like it, but it felt like a short film that was stretched out to five times its ideal length."
2,not that great,"This story is like many other ones, of a lost of a loved one, but end s up like a interview of two people who happend to live quite far from each other, is a very slow one, and I couldnt find the greatness on this film, not beacuse it is gay it means its ok sorry."
3,"Promising a lot, delivering not so much","Another example of very average gay theme movie. Although the concept seems quite interesting, the result gives me very mixed feelings.I will agree with other reviewers, who complained about quality of acting and directing. There are scenes which bring nothing into the action (the visit at doctor's office????, the visit at parent's of the victim). ANd some of them are shot in a very odd way (we can hear Jeff and Andrea talking, but the only thing we can see is open door...?)Unfortunately, the actor who plays Jeff fails on many levels too. Sometimes it takes a bit more than being handsome to convince. I just couldn't believe that he was really missing his mate (his love in fact).To sum up: this movie is not bad and you will not consider your time to be wasted after watching it."
2,Behind the times,"As a gay movie, Ciao is definitely behind the times. It moves very slowly and it never makes any sort of definitive point or statement. The two principal characters are good looking guys but you never see enough of them. Would not recommend this movie to my friends nor anyone else."
5,A Great movie,"This movie was simply wonderful. It had all the elements that make us love each other, cry for each other and grieve for our losses. While all the time framed in the modern world of Internet connections, and with such emphasis on our desperate need for love. A compelling movie. Five stars."
3,BAHHH,This was just ok..and im being nice...touching story...It's sooooo dry!!!! It was kinda boring..nice looking guys...Yet boring in places!!!
4,The Sun-dappled Swedish countryside lights up this film....,"A wonderful, heart-warming story about an aging, simple-minded farmer who has never known love, and the woman he meets when he decides that if he doesn't try it once, he might never know love at all....The actors are uniformly sweet and engaging, and the story plays itself out slowly and calmly. This is a little Swedish vacation, into the past and the countryside, and the simple life of a good-hearted farming man. Gorgeous cinematography. And wonderful details... it was great to see the traditional Mora clock, quietly ticking away, and reminding our dear farmer that life is short, and he should take life by the reigns and do his best. He does, and it's lovely.Those who love this film should see ""House of Angels,"" another of Nutley's quiet gems.Recommended."
5,it was like a summer day,"a tender story with strong charectors and the tradegy and beauty of love , a must see."
1,Frenetic and bombastic,"I found the performance frenetic and bombastic. I am familiar with the Fantasia from the Perahia-Lupu pairing, and I could hardly recognize that the two recordings were the same work. I like many of Kissin's recordings and I hold no bias against Levine. But this was not their finest hour."
2,Not worth my time,"I am doing research for an upcoming trip to Shangri-la region, and this is the first English book I read on the subject. It did not offer much information on anything other than some very limited history of the exploration in the Tsangpo River Gorge region. Since the names of places used in the book is different from those used in another Chinese book I read before, I had hard time cross-referencing and squeezing any useful information out of this book at all. Book reads like a C+ to B- college term paper on the subject."
4,Startling debut for British Neo-Goth rockers...,"If you're reading this, then congratulations, you're one click away from owning an album by one of the best bands of the last two decades. Always a cult favorite, even in their home country, AATT have spent the better part of two decades building up a large, very loyal cult following. It all started with this album, which arrived in 1984 with the aid of producer Lol Tolhurst of The Cure. The band itself sounds young and still a little rough around the edges, but the music itself doesn't sound dated at all. The foundations for AATT's trademark sound is layed here, with the swirling guitars and driving bass firmly in place on such standouts as ""So This Is Silence"", ""Impulse Of Man"", and ""Twilights Pool."" I've spent the better part of the last three years tracking everything from these guys down, so if this is your first AATT CD then I envy you. So, go ahead and do yourself a favor and add some depth and intelligence to your CD collection."
4,Essential early Goth,"One of the most overlooked, forgotten and underrated bands of the early 80's. AATT's debut album was released in 1983 putting them in the scene at the height of the goth/dark pinnacle - The really interesting fact about this band is that they formed in an attempt (and success) to open for the Cure when they were about to tour (bear in mind that in 1982 the Cure released ""Pornography"" and the influence on this album is very evident- so much so that you can easily tell that the band was listening to the album, and used it as a benchmark for their sound and drive in an attempt to win a spot on the tour. For anyone interested in pre ""The Top"" Cure, Joy Division and Bauhaus, And Also the Trees is a worthwhile purchase and addition to your collection."
1,disappointed,"I didn't realize when ordering that this was just an instrumental cd. I was very disappointed, I don't know how they can call this the Stevie Wonder Story. I hardly even recognized most of the tunes because they were not played as I am used to hearing them."
2,"""The Barbecue Swingers Live"" Much Better","I have been a big fan of Mr Ruffins for many years. I've seen him dozens of times, many at Vaughans and I own all of his cd's. I found this one very dissapointing. If this is what I had heard my fist time at Vaughans, I doubt I would have gone back. Kermit needs to play with an acoustic band! Cheesey electric keyboard sounds, electric bass, lousy covers, his daughter's singing and a bizarre version of Talking Loud and Saying Nothing make this one to avoid. Try his ""The Barbecue Swingers Live "" cd for a better live experience. Or any one of his first four cd's which are all very good."
4,Not Bad,"As a big fan of Kermit, I must say the CD isn't his best work, but its not bad and certainly, I prefer a live album to any recorded in a studio."
2,"love kermit, but this cd - not good","seen kermit live a couple of times and really enjoyed him. great entertainer with a lot of charisma. my first kermit cd i bought was this. not well produced. female vocals on 'do you know what it means ...' are terrible. a great song 'if you want me to stay' also suffers from terrible vocals.no fun writing this. must be another, better kermit cd out there.i do recommend seeing live - guaranteed fun!"
1,Terrible Product,This Dough is horrible. It is hard and crumbly. I work the curch nursery and ordered it for 2 and 3 year olds and it wouldn't hold together for sculpting or rolling. It ended up being a huge blue mess all over the floor.
5,Good All Around,"Bop! is a collection of bebop standards by Parker, Monk, etc. Morgan's solos are more original than could be expected. Many of these tunes have been played so many times that certain bebop cliches have become as much a part of the song as the original written parts! As a saxophone player I very much like his tone and see it as a nice break from that of the modern David Sanborn-imitating saxophonists. The rhythm section plays very well, too. The bass player stands out.This CD's good all around, and it's worth buying if you are interested in hearing a new interpretation of Parker/Monk, experiencing a modern take on bebop, or have cash to spend and would like good music. I'd give it *4 AND A HALF STARS* if that were an option. Very nice."
4,"32"" TV for an afordable price","An excellent big screen Tv considering its' price. The TV has limited capabilities, but extremely easy to navigate the available features with the remote. The remote has a sleek design and extremely comfortable to the hand. Has a wonderful stereo SOUND quality. Audio features include STEREO, SAP(Second Audio Program), MONO, AI SOUND and SURROUND. The Instruction manual claims that we can adjust the settings for Bass, Treble and Balance, but in reality we cannot. The factory set default settings for the picture adjustments is not the best setting. Has to experiment with the brightness and Picture for better quality. The colors and sharpness are excellent.Wish it had picture in picture capability and more input jacks. The LOCK feature allows for easy to follow parental control procedures.All in all a very good 32"" TV."
5,Fortune's Bridge,I have reread this book many many times. It never gets old. My paperback fell apart so I bought an epub book. I plan to read it again and again.
2,Great TV if you can get one without defects,"I went through three of these before giving up.Set #1 died withing 10 minutes of plugging it in. Set #2 had a color problem where blond hair looked green, dirt on a baseball field looked green, etc. Set #3 had a geometry problem where the bottom of the screen was bowed so an ESPN ticker looked like it was rolling downhill.If I had a set that combined the geometry of set #2 and the colors of #3, this product would have received 5 stars.It has tons of inputs, is a smaller size that fits into my entertainment center, and had an outstanding picture not counting color or geometry problems."
2,"Good TV, but too many problems.","The set that I have is one of the better ones (?) except for the geometry problem mentioned by Steve Bourgeois's review and the slight red push.Other than that, you cannot save picture settings for each input. So if you change settings for DVD and then watch regular TV, you have to readjust your settings.I would recommend the Sony XBR450 model. It's a bit more expensive but I think it is a more consistent model. I have the 36"" in the living room and it's great."
2,macroecon made confusing,"if you want to learn macroeconomics - buy mankiw's books - that's what my classmates tell me, but my professor decided that we should use this book. now i hate Macro.."
3,interesting to read,this book provides ample of information for macroeconomic topics but regarding the question bank given after the end of each chapters it provides no answers specially concerning the technical one's.It becomes quite an onerous task to find a perfect solution for them.Overall the book is best recommended for students of economics.
1,lamp failure,The lamp only lasts about 500 hours. Fails every 6 months. Will junkwhen warrenty over. Was told it would last 3500 hours. Will try and sue Panasonic/Ken Crane store. Don't know what else to do.
4,Better than a cup of atomic coffie,This quick read was a facinating tale. I found it humorous in a disturbing way. Murphy touches every emotional cord with a sledge-hammer and the result is near chaos (in the story not the text). Give this book a try. You won't be discouraged.
1,Yellowman DVD,"I was/am disappointed. Maybe I recieved a bad copy?? The DVD is grainy and the sound is degraded. The first song has several ""skips"" in it. I have not sat and actually watched the entire DVD because of the poor quality of the first 15 minutes but I expect that the DVD does not improve as is continues. There was a nice suprise inside though: a CD and a pack of flavored rolling papers... I'm new to Amazon, so I haven't looked into the return policy... but, I need to return this one...."
3,A first review,"A respectable book. Written in 1982, it offers much insight which is as relevant today (2004) as it was at the time of writing. The intro is a bit long-winded, but makes a good point. The mid-book fictional quiz for certification as a software professional is good. The author again makes a solid point, this time about what skills are more or less required of a (competent) software developer.Downsides:- perhaps a little too much anecdote for one sitting,- author will openly admit only that professional software development is an engineering discipline (, though he does concede that it is at least in part an art, or perhaps a craft).The book is also available electronically at the author's website."
5,Von Franz,"As always with Von Franz her writing is clear, concise and direct. No room for confusion here. With the book presented as a series of lectures it allows for ease of reading if one has limited time. One for the permanent collection."
3,"Good, but there's cheaper and simpler","I bought this because hubby wanted 'real' baby shampoo/wash and I wanted something organic and natural as possible. I like the flip-top. It pops up at the touch of a button. I don't like the long list of ingredients - it still has some chemicals thrown in, like sodium benzoate. It does clean baby, and his hair smells nice. I have since learned that organic liquid castille soap (like Dr. Bronner's baby castille soap) is fine for hair and body. I put some in a liquid soap 'foaming' bottle with some jojoba oil for conditioning & I use that for shampoo. You can google recipes for homemade shampoo using castille soap. You can also use melted coconut butter or flax oil to condition your hair (sounds silly, but it works great!) Be sure to use only a little bit of coconut butter before washing your hair (yes, condition before washing, not after) and use only a small amount - it goes a long way."
5,Excellent read.,"I loved this story personally. I thought the depiction of the relationship between Braden and Alexa was paced really well and the build up to their first encounter was especially tantalizing. It was hard sometimes to have to leave them and move back into the main story, but the plot was good enough that you didn't want to skip over it and that's saying a lot as hot as some of these scenes were!"
2,This was not great,"Well, I did like the writing style and the creativity as far as the world building and Sci-fi element. But that is it. The romance/erotica was way over done and really all lumped into one horrific endless encounter that the author seemed to want to fit in every fetish and sexual deviation she could. I do like arotica and romance and even books without any explicit sex. So my tastes run the gamut. But it would have been nice to see a little more plot line and layers to the story. I think, as far as writing ability, the author has potential - but her chapter divisions and plot arc were not done well at all. I had a hard time getting through it, but I wanted to so I could offer a fair review. Will keep her on my possible list - maybe next time..."
1,Great Book,This is a very interesting series and I was intrigued from the get go. It is a bit explicit but fascinating. I am on the 4th book and am interested in other books by Ruth D. Kerce.
4,Interesting start to a promising new series,"I have to admit that I didn't know if I would actually enjoy this book. The ""free"" books from Amazon are usually worth the price you pay for them. What a surprise! I really enjoyed this book. The characters were great and I can't wait to read more!"
3,Might have beed a good little movie BUT...,"Because I don't speak Icelandic, I was relying on the subtitles to get me through the film. I could not get the subtitles to function.I actually think it was a defective DVD. Requested a refund from Amazon. Sent DVD back, refund was completed within 2 to 3 days.Amazon service is exceptional!"
5,Easy to Understand. Worth Having!,"I really enjoyed this book because she makes everything very understandable. She also discusses the possible links between IBS and childhood abuse, stress, foods that irritate, etc. She states that studies have shown a link between depression (or stress related disorders) and IBS. She also gives practical advice on how to cope both mentally and physically. Some suggestions may be things you have heard before, but she puts it in such a way so you can really see the benefit of doing these, that outwieghs the inconvenience. A good example is the food diary. Who wants to be bothered with doing that. I didn't...so I never have. But she makes goods points as to why you should take a few weeks out of your life to do something that would likely save you months or years of dealing with the symptoms and pains because you didn't do it.The read is light and interesting, unlike medical books tend to be. It was helpful to me, a sufferer of IBS as well as Chron's Disease."
2,useless,"I have suffered with IBS for many years. This book offered simplistic advice that any reasonable person would have tried already, such as visualization. Save your money, do not buy this book."
2,Jensen JTH960 Behind the Neck Telephone Headset UPDATED,"The ""behind-the-ear"" style telephone headset is a personal preference, especially if you frequently use a headset and don't like your hair ending up with a sideways crease through it. This particular model is extremely cost effective (when compared to other similar product offerings), although most people would prefer a volume/mute control. However, after using this headset for some time I've noticed that it really doesn't fit very well ... the overall design does not allow for ANY adjustment other than the boom mic position (rotation) so it slips off the ears if you move around much (especially if you use it walking/pacing) and it actually hurts my ears if I try to use the plastic pieces that appear to be ear-loops."
5,A solo piano master,"As George Shearing has aged, his style at the piano has deepened. His long fascination with romantic and impressionistic classical composers has accentuated his ability to swing, and complemented his matchless way with a ballad.On this album, he continues his growth as one of the most fascinating figures in piano jazz. The opening of ""My Favorite Things"" is like a Bach fugue, flowing seamlessly into the piece in much the same way as his recording some years back of ""Where or When,"" which fused the standard with Satie's Gymnopaedie No. 2.For me, though, the best moment on the album is Shearing's statement of Stephen Sondheim's ""Anyone Can Whistle."" All the hallmarks of Shearing's current ballad style are there: the cloudy locked-hand chording, the light and high statement of the melody, the care and craft he gives a tune that isn't so well known. This is a wonderful statement by a master pianist at the top of his art."
4,Very Cool Book,"I think the photos are terrific, much better than the other book. It's very easy to use, you just look up the region you are interested in, and everything is grouped together along with a map and GPS. Excellent buy."
1,An inferior product,"This book is inferior to the recent Wright guidebook by William Allin Storrer. Storrer is the man who first travelled the continent in the early 70's, seeking out every extant Wright structure. He is the undisputed expert and has come out with a new color edition of his classic Guidebook, Frank Lloyd Wright: the Complete Catalog. That is the one to get. I have noted that several of the positive reviewers below have just one review to their ""names"". Curious. I guess we can draw our own conclusions about what that means."
1,A disappointing effort,"After waiting forever for this to publish, what an overpriced disappointment - photographic quality is abysmal - definite Kodachrome - and the accompanying text reads like random thoughts from the back of a napkin - and the editing is minimal. The International Sites are minimal to non-existant. For $39.95 - this is an absolute rip off. FLW and his houses deserve far better"
3,"CORNELIU PORUMBOIU, OPUS 1","*** 2006. Written and directed by Corneliu Porumboiu. Two prizes in Cannes and a European Film award nomination in the Best Screenplay category. In a small Romanian city, a TV journalist invites two guests for his afternoon talk-show. The debate will be about this unanswered question: was it or wasn't it a revolution in the town sixteen years before, in December 1989 ? Well, I liked the black humor of the film, I liked the Romanian language that is so close to French and Italian, in short I liked the first half of the movie. The second half of 12:08 EAST OF BUCHAREST which features Virgil Jderescu's TV program is in my opinion of lower quality and fails to create, in the viewer's mind or heart, empathy or simply some interest for the situation or the characters involved. A DVD zone discovery."
3,less often is more,"Porumboiu is a poet with an ear for linguistic rhythm, and his actors give Oscar-worth performances. The music with klezmer inflections matches the story's inconsequential, bitter-sweet ironies. The callers' remarks during the TV show punctuate the narration and when Bajean calls, his aural presence brings to mind Roberto Saviano's Gomorrah. However, when all ends the aftertaste is of a Prosecco, although all the ingredients would have suggested a Veuve Clicquot. I could not help inquire why and I think that the rotten over sweet taste came from the last caller's intervention. It was uncalled for by the narrative except perhaps to tell us what Porumboiu thinks about history, facts, and their relevance. I did not need to know that much."
1,Naspa...,"This is a sad attempt of a director trying to appear 'deep.' Yeah, seriously I don't know what kind of person enjoys these type of movies. The kind where you want something (ANYTHING) to happen, and nothing ever does.I bought it thinking I would learn something ; unfortunately the only thing I can draw from it is that Europeans (and my Romanian folk) in general need to STOP making movies about nothing. (And academies need to stop praising these sad sad SAD attempts at cinematography - a bad movie is a bad movie. Nothing more, nothing less...)"
4,Rumanian Comedy,"This movie is shot fairly traditionally and the main interest is in the scenario and dialogue. The plot is rather simple, with a televised debate on the last day of the Caucescu dictature giving the director the opportunity to look ironically at his country's current society. Simple does not mean simplistic though and the director makes best use of the simple premises, to good comedic effect most of the time. Don't expect joke after joke though, there's quite a bit of character development, which I found good, but slows down somewhat the movie (not a problem for me, just thought I'd mention for those of you who like fast paced comedies)"
4,Duti la dracula: or the life of a revolutionary,"Very decent debut. While no universal themes were broached,the film functions well as a chamber ensemble piece with occasional moments of hilarity. Still, ""My Sweet Little Village"" it ain't....beautiful and plaintive clarinet theme and decidedly Tarkovsky-esque ending, although the lamp-post symbolism was a little heavy-handed.It's a pity that hilariously colorful swear-words, readily recognizable by any Eastern European, were omitted in the subtitles. ...No doubt in keeping with American prudish attitudes or maybe to avoid film rating issues.P.S.Available for rent at Netflix."
1,Not in watchable condition!,"DVD is defective--stops halfway through, even after cleaning it. It must have been in that condition when sent."
2,Not Much To See,"Don't spend your money on this. This DVD is a copy of a 1981 (not 2008) Coronet Instructional Media Film and is 12 minutes long. It will show you a candle burning and tell you that the 1/2 life of carbon is 5,700 years, Potassium 40 is 1.3 billion years and Uranium 238 4.5 billion years (it is actually 4.468 billion years). Potassium 40 and Uranium 238 are found in igneous rock and carbon 14 in remains of once living things. Newer information gives the carbon 14 half life at 5,730 (+- 40 years). The reliability factor is never mentioned about how much a date can be off. Information on this DVD is outdated, very simplistic, and poorly presented. I bought ""Fossils: Uncovering Clues to the Past"" at the same time I bought this DVD, and it is just as bad. Out of the 250 science DVDs I own, these are the two worst. I'll update this review with a decent referral when I find one."
5,great masking tape,"this tape works very well for my art projects,its a shame the target store stoppedselling this. i give it 5/5."
1,Don't Bother,"I was looking for an alarm watch to remind me to take some afternoon medications. Turns out you can set the watch to beep every hour at the specified time or every 12 hours at the specified time. To get a reminder at 2:30 pm, I either get a 2:30am beep or must remember to re-set the alarm each morning. If I could remember to do that, I wouldn't need the watch in the first place! Plus the seller made absolutely no attempt to reply to my complaints."
2,light-weight stuff here,"This is certainly not the worst book ever written about twentieth century culture, but it is awfully smooth and conventional. His ideas about intergenerational discontent is as old as Dr. Spock, and he never questions the assertions of the more trashy books of late Marcuse. Slater just reiterates all this stuff in nicely written, clear language. I don't think this book will manage to evoke a single interesting idea for someone who has concerned themselves with the implications of political theory in the last two decades. Light-weight, but of course there is worse."
5,It makes you ask questions,"If you are an American living in the United States you need to buy this book. It was written about the 20th century but applies now more than ever. It makes you ask yourself why you use technology to distance yourself from people when you should be getting closer. That may sound hippie-ish, but ask yourslef if you've ever said in your job ""I only work here."" to another person who had a problem. If you have, you need to realize that democracy doesn't come from goods. It starts from people. It'll knock your socks off. If you aren't American you'll probably want it to see what a sorry state we're in, but with ""Californication"" theories, you might not be too far off."
4,I enjoyed this book,"Slater brings about some interesting takes on issues which, at the time the book was originally published, seemed earth-shattering. The really amazing thing is, though there is some dated quotes and observations, his views hold up after several decades. He looks outside of the liberal and conservative viewpoints ands finds somethings which could easily help our society."
5,Old timey,I had 1st been given this on vinyl back when i was in college years ago. I invariably lost it and have been searching ever since. And much to my surprise here it is. A wonderful medley of very early American music.
3,Good Basics,This is a good manual for learning the basics of ATV maintance. That is it's only draw back it only covers the basics. As a new owner of a used ATV I did find information in the book that helped send me in the right direction. This book would also be good for someone looking to buy a used ATV. It has a section that tells you what to look for and how to check out a used ATV before buying.
2,Vaguely useful,"We did a thorough comparison of the Budapest Guide and the Budapest section of Lonely Planet's Hungary Guide. The extra information provided in the Budapest book was (for the most part) simply more detail about the material already reported in the nationwide guide. It was more conversational, more spread out, yet with no genuine added content. Reviews of eateries and lodgings were no more in-depth and only slightly greater in number. Take a pass on this one. Lonely Planet's Hungary Guide is roughly just as useful in Budapest, and has the added advantage of telling you about so much in this fascinating country that's outside the standard tourist line."
3,lacking,"The restaurant descriptions seemed very vague and generally unhelpful. I think that the maps could be organized better, so that they would be easier to use.The description of the Metro did not adequately describe the different types of tickets and where and when they are valid. I found out at the end of our trip that tickets are cheaper (admittedly, only a bit) when bought from a ticket window rather than a ticket machine. And by the time I left, even after searching two guidebooks, I still wasn't always sure which type of ticket I needed for a given journey."
1,Not a good product,I can't hear threw the ear piece. My recommendation is not to buy this product. The ear piece doesn't sit well on the ear to allow proper usage.
1,Amazon Title Error,"Okay, Amazon has the items wrong.MX303-N1 Retractable Headset is for the Nokia 6600, 6010, and 3585ANDMX303-N3 Retractable Headset is for the Nokia 3300, 6500, 8800 series"
4,Pretty good t.v.,"Well I have bad cable reception in my area, and usually if I don't have a console t.v., the reception can be very poor. So, I was a bit hesitant in buying a non-console set. This Panasonic CT27D31 set handles the poor reception in my area pretty good! Most of the channels are crisp, color is great, and sound is good. I haven't hooked it up to my stereo system yet. I have a VCR, DVD, and game system hooked up to the set, and all of the units work great with the set. The only complaint I really have is with the remote control. I'm use to just pointing at the t.v. and having it react accordingly. However, with this remote, I tend to have to point and click more than once, or point DOWN to get the signal for the remote to pick up. The universal remote code doesn't work for my cable box either. However, it does work for my VCR and DVD player.Overall, it's a good set for watching movies and playing games!"
1,Prices on television are high even for the low end ones,Well I think that the prices for the televisions are pretty high considering you can get some of the same sets for a lot cheaper if you watch the adds.
5,FUN GAME!,"I cannot believe all these bad reviews, so I guess these people are all Air Force veterans and have seen it all. To tell you the truth, I am very impressed with this game. It has A LOT of missions, it's extremely realistic, and above all, it's fun!! Also, this is the best PC Air Combat game I have ever played. You get to land on aircraft carriers, fly around the Golden Gate Bridge and engage in tough dogfights. In sum, I highly recommend this game."
4,easy flying,"This game runs best on win 95 or 98. This game is easy to play, if you are not good with avoiding all the SAMs than put it in invincable mode. Some of the graphics look a little flat at times. I like the game play and free flight. This is a fun and interesting game."
1,problems with new computer users,"Most of the users with the new Windows XP system find problems with drivers, screens freezes and problems with anti viruses when using this program."
1,WOW What a bad game!,"Um, Do not buy this game unless you get it for under 5 bucks. it would not run on my system. and was a bad expieriance. i would let you know how it played but, i have no idea as all i would get is a black screen and i would have to hard boot it. i have win xp. 1800 amd with a geforce 4 4200 with 2400 ddr ram...nothing else has crashed my system. just this badly programed game. (( DONT BUY IT!!))"
3,Fun and Entertaining,"Jetfight IV is very fun. The ground graphics are so-so, but the gameplay is awsome. The only downside is there only is a small amount of missions you can play before you've played them all. A plus is that the controls with the keyboard aren't confusing at all and they even give you cheats that you can use to make your plane invulnerable to missles, re-arm your plane in the air and re-fuel your plane in the air. Overall, I'd say this game is worth the money and is the best air-to air and air-ground simulater I've every played."
4,Looking good...,"Back in 1992 Mission Studios came out with Jetfighter, a pretty good jetfighter simulation game with good graphics by 1992 standards. Then Mission Studios announced their to Jetfighter sequel, Jetfighter II. A few years later Jetfighter III came out. A year later the long awaited Jetfighter III Fullburn came out, an improved version of the Jetfighter III. Now Mission Studios is coming out with Jetfighter IV Fortress America. All reviews that I have read are positive. With 50,000 square miles of land to fly over, Great Flight models, and detail 4 times better than that of Jetfighter III Fullburn. The terrain graphics were made from real satellite images of the San Francisco area, and continue deep into Nevada. The flyable planes are the F/A-18 Superhornet, F-14 Tomcat, and the F-22 Raptor. The game is coming out in Late September. I can't wait to get my hands on this game!"
4,Excellent flight combat for all skill levels....,I have played this game on two different computers of mine and it runs just fine. It has a simple flight model and easy to use weopons controls. The detail of scenery is a little plain down low and nice high above. I think that the sound drivers could have been better since it does crash with sound problems. I think other raters here could still play the game well if they ever change their sound card.
2,Problem Plagued,"I thought, maybe, because it was outdated. Install was easy. When trying to enter a campaign my screen would go black,and I would have to re-boot every time. Then I couldn't even CTRL/ALT/DEL to get out of it. When I could play it, the graphics were good. That is until I tried to turn my aircraft. The HUD images would trace and trail, as well as other aircraft in view. Lack of instructions didn't help either. This sim is problem plagued. I'd rather go back to my Janes Anthology Fighters."
1,JetFighter 4,"This says that it will run with Windows ME, but it did not with my computer - Gateway, Microsoft programing, 64 ram - I had all the ""requirements."" We even had a joystick, but could not get it to work with the game. I am finding that not all games will run with our computer, regardless of having the requirements as specified by the manufacturer. I just say, beware! As for the game, I suppose if you can get it working, it might be a fun simulator, but I wouldn't know!!"
1,Forget playing on XP!,"Pentium 4, GeForce 4 Ti4200, 512RAM, 2.4 GHz, Windows XP Pro, never a problem with over 30 other graphically demanding games -- and this game will not get beyond the splash screen except with tremendous tweaking of settings and configuration of ini files! Even then, the controls are entirely senseless: totally unrelated to ordinary flight sim models, unintuitive and mostly unchangeable! Worse yet, effectively no support! Don't bother if you're running XP or interested in something that approximates real flight!"
5,The Sain-Germain Chronicles,Again this book was purchased as a gift for my son. He gave me a list of Titles . He is very please with all of the books i have purchased
4,Good old school,"IF you like GBH you'll like these guys. Some really good old raw punk stuff.Classics are ""face the slayer"" and ""zombies"".Just good old school punk, it's that simple."
2,How to Shoot HDV overated,"for a small soft cover book the price was way to high,I tried to get it from my library as I had already read many other books three times the size which according to the price marked on the back were less,however it gave a little idea of what I was up against,I would not recommend it for the price,if it cost $10 or less it would be OK."
5,Excellent account of innovative strategies in COIN,"This book is a very good look at a remarkable approach to conducting counter-insurgency operations. While in some ways specific to the particular place and time of Rhodesia in the 1970s, anyone with a professional or personal interest in how military COIN operations and strategies should give this book a look, if you can bear the cost of finding it used.Besides being a fascinating read, it is also very much a page-turner sort of good read. The one critique I might offer is that a reader would benefit from a good understanding of the political situation in Rhodesia, Mozambique, and elsewhere in southern Africa at the time, though this is certainly not an absolute requisite, and the details a reader may not understand are not central to the narrative of the Selous Scouts' operations and exploits."
4,good condition,"Haven't read the whole thing yet, but it's in pretty good condition for its age and so far a great read."
1,We ended up using this CD,"as a cup holder for our coffee table. After that, it made a pretty decent frisbee."
5,Speaks to your soul,"I've loved Erasure since a friend introduced me to them 6 years ago. I have every album and this is one of my favorites. This is musician music. The lyrics speak to your heart and the music is something any musician knows how to appreciate. Most Erasure fans don't listen to the lyrics, because for a whie, they were fluff and meaningless, meant to be danced to, not listen to. Listen to these, you won't be dissapointed."
5,The Best Of The Best!!,"I was pleased to see that, in 1995, Erasure had released a new album. I was simply blown away, though, at the different direction this one took. Gone were the campy, almost empty, songs that I had loved for almost a decade. In their place was a set of ethereal and thought-provoking songs that seem more part of a whole production rather than a list of tracks. Erasure really tapped into true emotion with ""Grace"", ""Stay With Me"", and especially ""Rock Me Gently"". This certainly isn't music to dance to, it's music to live to.If ordered to pick one album and destroy the rest, I would keep this one."
2,Extended Songs Didn't work for Erasure,"I own all of the Erasure albums and they are my favorite group, but this album is not that good. There are a few good tracks on this album, but even these are almost ruined because about 2 minutes of basically dead silence is added to the song at the point where it normally would end. And by the way, my favorite album is the innocents.IF I HAD TO DESTROY ONE ERASURE ALBUM, THIS WOULD BE IT!!!!!"
3,"Good Music, Bad Lyrics","To every song, there are two main compontents--the lyrics and the music. While the music on this CD is better than most of the chewed-up-and-spit-out ""pop"" of today, it isn't as good as some other music. This CD is mostly a ""mood"" CD. While it won't make you think (at all), it does have the tendency to relax you. Very very good background music.Now, to the lyrics. 100% cliche. Not very creative at all. ""Night Owls;"" ""you made your bed, now lie in it;"" ""sands of time;"" cliches are abundant. If lyrics are very important to you, do not buy this CD.Overview: Nice, relaxing music. Cliched lyrics. Good CD, but there's been better--much better."
2,This isn't what they used to be,"I'm an Erasure fan and I must say that after this album, I didn't want to buy any more of their music. I listened to it a few times and there are 2 or 3 songs that I enjoy; but overall, it's not something I would suggest to anyone else. And just so you can refer this against your personal Erasure tastes, I judged this album against ""The Innocents"" and ""Wild"", which I believe to be their best albums."
3,Fire Fighter game,"This game can be and is chalanging at the same time. I think they could have provided more levels insted of the 8 which ends with an earth quiae ind you have to rescue people outside the structures, and inside the subway put out fires insind the subway & outside the subway. each level is a bit more chalanging than the last and usualy 3 missions per level except for level 8 there is only 1. This is not the best game I've played but it is fun"
4,Fun.. but I my computer is too slow,"This game was really fun.Only problems that I could tell is that your firefighters don't always go or do what you want them to. And if that happens they do nothing.It was pretty realistic in its fire development. You had to be aggressive to battle the fire. SOmetimes, though, things would just happen with out a cause because they follow the scenario.fun game.. especially if you work in the fire service."
4,The TVP Cookbook,Its a great book. It helps you to understand what TVP is and how to use it in many meals. Didn't know it has so much protein.
3,TVP Made Easy,"Simply put, this is a cool little book filled with creative, meat-free menu options.The recipes are simply and delicious, making this a good cookbook to add to your collection."
5,A Decent Study Of Film History,"Film history is an interesting course of study. Today we take for granted computer generated special effects and the idea that movies work, but that wasn't always the case.When the movies first came out, some people were not even convinced that they would be viewable by everyone - because they did not understand the nature of lenses and vision. So, people had to be convinced.The idea of jump cuts, dialogue and that films could be different than plays was also new.This DVD gives a great explanation of what problems early filmakers had and how they solved them. I was amazed that persistance of vision was a debatable concept at one point.It helped my understanding of film history."
2,Lifespan shorter than Canon's,"I bought this battery at the same time I bought my Canon Powershot S30. I've owned it for almost two years now and have used both the Canon battery that came with the camera and this Digipower battery almost exactly the same amount of times.About a year ago, I noticed the camera would blink the ""low battery"" icon much earlier when I was using the Digipower battery. It still worked but didn't last as long. Now it barely lasts ten minutes of ""On"" time. They say Li-Ion batteries do not build up memory or whatever, but the fact remains my Digipower lasts ten minutes while the Canon battery still lasts almost two hours.I gave it two stars because of the price; you get what you pay for. This Digipower battery is not a ""replacement"" but a ""cheap alternative"" that dies after a couple of years of use."
1,False Advertising,"THIS IS NOT A DIGIPOWER BATTERY! Avoid this seller. The description of the battery make and quality are misleading. ESMARTER from NY is the seller, but EVERYDAYSOURCE.COM, from CA sent the product. Seller describes the battery as having 720mAh, but the batteries I received had 1800mAh, so I thought it should last the same if not longer than my original stock Canon battery or an ACTUAL Digipower battery I own, I was wrong. These batteries are cheap ""Made In China"" knock offs, and last much shorter than my depleted batteries. When it comes to these batteries, do yourself a favor and buy from a reputable store. These companies just change their names and sell the same garbage to the next sucker."
1,Don't Waste Your Money on This Battery!,"From the first time I used the DigiPower replacement battery for my Rebel xTi (400D) I noticed that I could not shoot as many images (in JPEG format) as I could with the Canon brandname battery before I needed to recharge it. And after a year and a half of use, my original Canon battery is still going strong while I can no longer completely recharge the DigiPower battery, which I've only been using one year. Buy the Canon brandname battery and don't waste your money on this junk!"
2,Short lifespan,I purchased this battery at the same time I picked up my XTi. It's been about a year and a half now and this battery no longer takes a charge while the original battery is still going strong.
3,big fan for years,"This is a somewhat strange recording. The covers are typical Emmy Lou: recordings of wonderful songs from master songwriters that may have been overlooked. However, her voice is really stretched and scratchy. My 14 year old son commented: ""Who is that old lady singing?"" Also, the orchestration is too busy and lush at times. While I understand that all artists must grow creatively, the sound is distinctively different from the country ""roots"" sound that she seemed to have championed over the years. Contrast the production of many of these cuts from that of her cover of Leonard Cohen's ""Prayer for a Runaway Horse"" a few years back. I found a lot of this cd lacking."
5,"MOODY, EXPERIMENTAL ALT ROCK CAMEO FROM HARRIS","No CD collection is complete without this marvellous venture by Harris, which includes breathtaking covers of numbers by stalwarts such as Neil Young, Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and Lucinda Williams among others. Giving the album its dark ambience and its almost primal percussions is Daniel Lanois, better known for his work with U2 or Peter Gabriel. And it shows.I thought of Harris as primarily a country/folk singer, but here she breaks free from the conventions of cheatin', hurtin', pickup trucks and what not; her song-selection addresses real issues here. I highly recommend picking up Wrecking Ball, a work of exceptional grace, depth, and beauty. Noteworthy number: ""Deeper Well""."
4,The amazing versatility of Emmy Lou,"From the first notes of ""Where Will I Be,"" you realize this is not the Emmy Lou you might be used to. She's breaking down the boundaries here with such songs as Steve Earl's ""Goodbye"", Neil Young's ""Wrecking Ball"", Bob Dylan's ""Every Grain of Sand, Lucinda Williams' ""Sweet Old World"", and Jimi Hendrix' ""May This Be Love"". The material is certainly different, but it is still our Emmy Lou. The difference between her ad many contemporary ""divas"" is that Emmy Lou sings the songs. She doesn't yell them. She let's us hear the melody without assaulting our eardrums. And so indeed there remains that beauty and integrity she is known for still shining through.Many of you won't like the modern sound here, but others will be amazed at her handling of this material. This CD and Red Dirt Girl both are new territory for her, but Wrecking Ball is a much brighter and happier record."
5,Wrecking Ball,"Bought it when it first came out...thought it was stunning then and that hasn't changed. Only thing I'm undecided about is which track is best....""Goodbye"" is amazing.....best ""roadtrip"" CD I know.Top CD of the 90's and Top Ten in my collection, including vinyl.Saw Wrecking Ball tour at Fitzgerald Theatre in St. Paul....confirmed everything."
1,Very disappointing,"This is the first Emmylou Harris record I ever purchased. I'm a big fan of some of the songwriters whose work Harris covered on this disc, including Bob Dylan, Neil Young and Steve Earle. Considering all the glowing reviews, I expected much more than I got. This disc is heavy on production, monotonous, and downright unlistenable. If you're looking for good county or folk music, look elsewhere. Yuck."
2,Tantric Country,"Being a college graduate, I feel I want to stretch my boundaries at time- case in point when I want to hear ""Joshua Tree"", but still have a little bite left, in me I put on this record. It has all the jangly guitars and pomp of that classic, but without the high-school-soul. When the other reviewers refer to it's soulful qualities I'm assuming they mean soul- as in a dead body. Don't get me wrong, this is a good record, but not a great record. Daniel Lanios is single-handedly responsible for new-aged country. If Steve Earle is the Devil's right hand, then Daniel Lanois is Depok's publicist. The only thing this album is missing is Emmy-lou singing ""I'm Every Woman."" Don't get me wrong though, this is a great album to have meaningful sex to. Whereas ""Josua Tree"" may be right for a one night stand, ""Wrecking Ball"" is right for Mrs. Right."
1,Absolutely awful,"Mumbled lyrics. Overbearing ""production"". A noisy, incoherent mess. Not worth listening to on any level. I'd give this no stars if it was possible."
4,Give it time,"On the first few hearings I was convinced that Daniel Lanois had overwhelmed Emmylou's beautiful and fragile voice to showcase a few production tricks that aren't even that original any more. I played the CD when I was bored with everything else and by this means I've gradually been converted. On a good hi-fi system, the complex and layered arrangement no longer sounds like a wall of mud, but instead resolves into real instruments. Daniel Lanois provides a distinctive sound and in doing so goes beyond what we normally expect from a a producer. However, I now appreciate that the vocals are at the centre of every track, and this fine album is correctly credited to Emmylou Harris. Wrecking Ball is an impressive one-off work that defies classification. I give it 3.9 stars. If you've not heard it yet, keep an open mind and a listen on a good stereo."
4,whispers from the heart,"emmylou harris sings songs of tears... at times,she doesnt so much sing but whispers in quiet desperation. while her previous albums were never strictly country, this one is by far the furthest removed one from her country roots.it's awesome how jimmy hendrix's 'may this be love' is turned into a sonorous wall of sound.daniel lanois the star producer has done a colossal job creating a fresh sound to material from great songsmiths like bob dylan, anns magarrigle, lucinda williams. my favourite is the title track by neil young. strangely, i'm reminded of ms havisham and her white cobwebbed wedding gown in 'great expectaion'. it sounds like an affair that never was and promise is just a word. but no folks, not this cd, it's emmylou harris' best so far,and that alone is no mean feat."
1,Turn Down the Reverb,"This isn't an Emmylou Harris record, but a Daniel Lanois record with Emmylou singing. If you like Lanois, you'll love it. I find his studio tricks and over use of re-verb and echo that drowns out the voice of an angel to be annoying. I'd rather listen to any Emmylou record over this one. Heck I'd rather listen to 90% of albums over this one. I put away for over 10 years, found a copy and try to listen to it but three songs in the music was so horrid I couldn't take it any longer."
2,disappointed,"While I usually give credit for artists who reinvent their sound, I cannot do so here. This album, to put it bluntly is over-produced. Lanois's trademark sound--heavy use of echoing guitars, and reverb filled base lines suffocate the real reason why people listen to emmylou: the softness, compassion and genuineness of her voice. In the Hendrix cover, Emmylou's voice is lost in the amplified chaos of Lanois's U2 sound. Hendrix himself performed this piece the way Emmylou should have.Sweet old world is the only gem; simply recorded, no heavy bass and guitar lines. Moreover, Emmylou's voice along with Neil Young's harmony carries the piece. For Emmylou fans stick to earlier albums or her Linda Rondstadt collaboration. My favorite Emmylou album: live at the ryman."
2,Pretty Awful,"Emmylou Harris is a fabulous singer, but on this disc her vocal purity is flattened by Daniel Lanois' overbearing production style. What worked for U2 doesn't work for Emmylou."
2,LEARNING TO APPRECIATE,"I bought this CD on other's review and the fact that ELH is my favorite female singer from way back. I love most music and can try to appreciate all forms. My favorite style from ELH is 'Together Again' from Profile (The Best of Emmylou Harris) - her voice is crisp, strong, and the instrumentals are fantastic (Floyd Cramer-style). I have listened to Wrecking Ball three times and I am beginning to like it. It will never be among my favorites. I also like Cimarron, Cowgirl's Prayer and Live At the Ryman soooooooooooooooooooooooo much more."
1,Another Lanois Disaster,"Fair warning to anyone tempted to purchase this cd on the basis of the reviews below, as I was: this is the worst album Ms. Harris ever made, and the fault is clearly that of the producer. Ms. Harris doesn't have the stongest voice but it is clear as a bell, except on this album, where she mumbles the lyrics, such as they may be since you can't make them out, two octaves below her range to the accompaniment of the most tastless, overblown arrangements imaginable, for a lady who can sing to the angels with an acoustic guitar. Amazingly, Langois did the same thing to Willie Nelson, producing Mr. Nelson's worst album (in a career with more than a few misses), making him sound like Clarabell the clown. If you are new to Emmylow Harris, try Blue Kentucky Girl to hear what she is capable of."
1,What a thorough disappointment,"I thought there was nothing Emmylou could do that I wouldn't love, but this album proved me wrong. It sounds like it was recorded on a cheap hand held recorder in an abandoned warehouse. And the material she records is simply uninteresting; in fact it downright wears on the listener the second or third time through. Yes, I realize the critics are all in ecstasy over the album, but the fact is it is far below her usual standards. Skip this one, and try her earlier and more recent work."
2,Ugly,"I've listened to this album many times over the years since it was released, trying to find a 'reason to believe.' Except for a moment hear and there when Harris can actually be heard, I'm afraid my original impression remains: a horrible mess by a great singer. And virtually all of the blame can be attributed to the producer, Daniel Lanois. He has covered Harris' slender voice with layer upon layer of electronic garbage, so much so that it's hard to tell if the songs are better than they sound (certainly his own compositions are pretty pathetic compared to some that Harris has written). One could hope that this was just an abberation by Lanois, but his work with Neil Young and others is just as bad. Kudos to Harris for being adventurous, but I'm glad she moved on. If not for the fact that it's Emmylou Harris, one star."
3,Artsy Fartsy,"producer meets hip ""country"" singer and this is the result. Emmylou's career is beyond reproach and her choice of material, even here, is excellent. However, Mr. Lanois seems hellbent on putting his signature sound on everything, to the detriment of the artist he should be showcasing. Emmylou is strong enough to somewhat overcome his heavy hand most of the time, but overall, her strength is hidden behind the ""avante garde"" production. Daniel Lanois seems more intent on producing a Daniel Lanois record than he does on producing an Emmylou Harris record. Too bad for both of them."
1,"a horrible, horrible album","This album got great reviews, and many of my friends who don't care for country music liked it. I have everything Emmylou ever recorded, and this album ranks as by far the worst. A piece of utter crap. I couldn't even get through two listenings. To be avoided by lovers of the old Emmylou."
4,"excellent performance, musicians & lyrics",this album was a change in direction and her singing style has evolved into a style that's more mature and sensitive
3,Inconsistent Quality of Songs,"Like any Emmylou Harris album, the quality of this album is totally dependent upon the quality of the songs. And here, like most of her albums, the quality is mixed with several very fine songs (Goodbye, All My Tears, Goin' Back to Harlan, Sweet Old World, Orphan Girl, Blackhawk) and several ok songs (Wrecking Ball, Every Grain of Sand, Waltz Across Texas Tonight) and several inferior songs (Where Will I Be, Deeper Well and especailly May This Be Love is really bad). With all of the wonderful songs out there to choose from, it is a shame that Emmylou too often picks inferior bad songs to sing. Stick with Bluebird, Ballad of Sally Rose, or Cimmeron."
4,good value,"these dog collars are strong, durable and well finished. the measurements are accurate. I am actually using them for a different purpose - retro-fitting shoes, so strength was essential. my package arrived a day early.I would buy this item again."
3,An OK bear costume,"I purchased this kid's bear costume off another site as my daughter has an upcoming musical program at school and she plays a bear. Well, it is not easy finding a bear costume that will fit ages 6 and up in a kid's size. There was one other bear costume that seemed well-made but it was more than what I wanted to pay. Anyway, I found this bear costume and promptly ordered it in a size 6-8. I found that it was just right for my child, in terms of fit and height (she is a bit tall for a first grader). The costume itself feels comfortable and is easy to pull on. There are no zippers, just an opening to slip through and over and a ribbon to tie and keep the costume on.This is a plain bear costume with no bells or whistles, and for the price I paid for it, it fit the bill just right."
4,Good Read,"Good Story, but a bit of a let down from the other Knight stories. I will withhold my final verdit on the Spice Series until I read the next one."
2,A Waste of Time,"This book was the first Gaelen Foley book I have read. I'm actually sorry I purchased it. Much of the dialogue seemed way too contemporary for 1817. I haven't researched but I seriously doubt that ""asthma"" was diagnosed as such in the early nineteenth century, and was it really necessary to introduce the ailment? Not really.The whole style of the book is bad formula historical romance with awkward dialogue, and clumsy introductions of secondary characters,obviously added to get readers to buy sequels and prequels. If this is any indication of the author's typical writing style, I will not be reading Gaelen Foley again. How is this stuff published?"
4,Great exotic background that just takes you away,"This is a very different kind of story background and I love how Ms Foley takes the reader to an exotic and rich place with her writing. I love the hero; he is just so sexy and honorable. The best kind of combination. I felt that the 2nd half of the book could have been better with a little more intimacy between the characters. However, it was a wonderful read and I couldn't put it down until the last page."
3,Not Foley's Best,"Good story, but not as emotionally intense or as much steam as I've come to expect from Foley. Hopefully, she hasn't lost her touch. Preview of Her Secret Fantasy sounded very intriguing, however. I'm eager to learn all about Derek's Kama Sutra skills."
1,"Well, on to the next author...","This was my first Gaelen Foley book and wow, what a dissapointment. The story looked great, and I'd heard good things about it, but I have to say that this book did not live up to any of the expectations I had for it. Georgiana was obnoxious and anachronistic - I couldn't bring myself to like her at all. I also had the feeling she would have fit in better in the 21st century than the 19th. The plot was muddled, and at places very silly. The dialogue was forced and formulaic, and I really don't understand how the two of them ended up together - they were about as hot as Minnesota in the winter.I don't think I'll be buying any more of this author's books."
2,Bit boring ...,I liked her Foley's 'Lord of Ice' but this book I almost stopped reading it many times and finally stopped around p375. It just was not that interesting.
2,"Boring, Boring, Boring--No True Connection--Too Much To Muddle Through","And muddled this book was. It took too long to meet the characters together. His possessive nature made no sense in any way. There was no connection between the two main characters. My goodness, I think it took me two hours to read this book because it was mostly filler--the book could have been 50 pages and accomplished the same thing as it does at its current length--a sign of a truly badly written text. There was no story there--no romantic tension to build and shape into anything. I am still confused why they are together and how they got there--the headlong rush that fails to make sense. Such a let down. The text felt rushed and thrown together. The more Ms. Foley writes the more forced her texts become."
4,series books,"I enjoy the way Gaelen Foley writes. I liked the fact that it was not in England like the other novels in the series. And as always, there's romance, mystery, and strong characters. I do think the first series of books was better, but I won't hold that against her. When books are all connected, you can really get into the people you ""meet"" in them and want to read more about them."
3,"I like it....Should have been better, I expected better","I absolutely love Gaelen Foley, but she kind of missed the ball park with this book. I will read the next installment in the Spice Trilogy, but I can wait, no rush. However, with the Knight series, I could not wait. Griff was great, but he was not as Alpha as she would want you to believe. Georgie's impulsiveness and feistiness never came to fruition. Their love story needed more. The India part of the book was awesome, intriguing and sexy. Their English relationship was boring. Georgie became boring. Gaelen could have done better. But, I still love her and will read the next two installments."
2,Gave up,"Too much mayhem and political upheaval in India. I gave up about half-way through. Too bad, I'm a big fan of her other books. Definitely check out the Fire and Ice books about her twin brothers instead."
3,Really let down by this one!!,"I cannot believe this book was just not what I expected. I absolutely loved her last book, and I have really enjoyed all of her other novels. This book was a real disappointment. She usually has alot of passion and steam in her novels and while there are love scenes, they aren't the norm. Do not judge this author by this book alone. Every other book she has written I have really loved."
2,Hard to believe this is the same author!,"I've read (and re-read) every single book by Gaelen Foley. In my opinion, this book is almost unrecognizeable as a product of her imagination. Foley's signature emotional intensity between the two main characters was nowhere to be found. In fact, the characters were flat and boring, and the love scenes and sexual tension were about as hot as dry ice. I am severely disappointed--I hate to give this author such a bad review (and check out my other reviews-I am not a negative reviewer!) but it is well deserved. Don't waste your money--rent from the library if you're curious."
4,Great Blues from Eddie Kirkland!!,"Little Eddie Kirkland has been playing the blues since the 1930's, first as a street musician growing up in alabama, then as a journeyman Blues guitar and harmonica player in Detroit. Kirkland has been appearing on records since the 1950's. This album only re-inforces the fact that Kirkland is a great Blues artist to be reckoned with.This albumis chock full of great blues tunes with Eddie Kirkland surrounding himself with many of the the best Blues musicians around. Tab Benoit, G.E. Smith, Cub Koda, Kenny Neal and Sonny Landreth all make appearances. On this CD you will hear harmonica playing by both Kenny Neal and of course by Mr. Kirkland himself.It is definitely a nice album to add to your collection."
1,"Sons of Eve, Sons of Mary","What Hoffman ignores is that men with homosexual orientations are putting themselves in the near occasion of sin by entering the priesthood much like an alcoholic getting a job as a bartender. So it is not about politics, but rather the nature of the orientation itself."
4,Worth The Money,I saw the movie and payed special attention to the music. I figured I loved the movie so why not buy the soundtrack. I wasn't dissappointed.
2,"Beware! That's not a hillarious ""Pulp Fiction"" mix!","This disk is not so bad , but it's not good eather. Maybe I'm too picky, but I liked only ""Vertigogo"" tracks on it. The reat are just boring. If you're looking for the same hillarious Tarantino's blend as ""Pulp fiction"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"" were stay away from this one. It's ""quite almost exactly"" not what are you looking for."
5,Excellent Reader,This book is an excellent collection of essays from both disciplines. There is a wide range of topics and view points.
4,A Tale of Love and Sorrow,"Maya Laor is a young Israeli girl who is excited to be starting her first assignment in the army. She meets a handsome officer named Dov and they begin a heady romance. When a bombing in Tel Aviv tears them apart forever, Maya escapes the terror and moves to Virginia to attend the university. Although she hopes to find peace in this new landscape, she discovers that the daily routine of classes and college life force her to recognize what she lost back home.Told in a series of flashbacks, Maya's past in Israel is interspersed with her present in America. It's a captivating look at one side of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It's also a glimpse into the difficulties of living in a new culture. This well-crafted story might appeal to older young adults or anyone interested in fiction about Israel or Palestine."
5,Light Years,"I recently finished reading Light Years, a magnificantly-written story of an Israeli girl who moves to the US after losing her boyfriend in a suicide bombing who must find her ability to love and be close to others after losing her trust in the future. The story portrays vivid images and is written in a manner that is very smooth and ongoing, so it is rare to have to reread a sentence in order to interpret it. I highly recommend this book!"
4,Choosing the Right Size,"The sizes given are for men and woman are advised to order one size smaller. I found that the shoes were a little loose using this approach. I can use them with socks but if your feet are on the small or narrow side of the full sizes, I would suggest you order two sizes smaller than the mens shoe."
2,"Warship's Data series No. 1, USS Kidd",Typical of older books of this type. A fair number of good B&W; pictures. Reasonable in quality.Good for most naval collection. Not up to the standard of more recent publication. Usually available easily and cheaply.
3,Back in the day.,"Do you remember when you were a child? All these crazy fantasies got you excited to be alive, even grow up. This show reminds me of those days, and how excited I was to be something I will never be. But, isn't that what being a kid is all about. Adventure galore eh. Buy this for you, and your kids."
3,Socket A,this only works with socket A processor i would check what kind you need in your pc before you buy this~ i didnt and i had to return it!
2,Read up on this one first.,"AMD makes a bunch of processors. Some are better than others. This one is affordable, but don't plan on doing much overclocking with this one! I got one up to 1917MHz before toasting it and my board too.My Athlon XP 2400+ does much better. Do your homework if you are planning on building a system. AMD revised the Thoroughbred chip design and added some layers to them. Get the next version, it's a better chip."
5,To the Heart,"I have followed Frederic's carreer from the beginning and was looking forward to his newest release, Symphony of Light, and once again he delivers some sounds that speak to the heart.The opening number sets the athmosphere and tone...and the it goes into his wonderful compositions with some notes inspired by all the great composers and it all works in harmony!As to the two reviewers who gave this CD a 1 star I can only shake my head in disbelief. You can sooth everybody apparently. I find this music truly a blessings! Thank you Frederic, for being you!"
4,Serenity!,"I first heard a track from this disc on KWXY in Palm springs, and ordered the disc that night! ""In the Palm of God's Hand"" is NOT a religious piece. I am not a practicing Christian, but found the music peaceful and it puts one in a serene mood."
5,"Enlightening, entertaining and easy to read!","The author not only reveals important and interesting aspects of a child's psyche, but also gives you insights on how to use those aspects to make your products and brands ""ever cool""."
2,Too simple and broad,"This is pretty simple and easy to read. There are many examples of successful and unsuccessful products. The book uses these as supporting arguments and the occasional quote from an industry person. But there is no other relevant research on the minds of children that makes them gravitate towards the things things they do. That is if there was, it was not cited. In addition, the research is outright sexist. It encourages readers to market to boys and girls separately, and in the most stereotypical ways possible.Instead, I recommend ""Brandchild"" by Lindstrom and Seybold is a much better and more in-depth look at the same topic. It says some of the same things as ""Ever-Cool"" but it is more up-to-date, more in-depth, less overtly sexist, and uses more numbers and statistics from their worldwide research to back up their claims. They also give more insight into how to target a group."
4,RED,"My only complaint is with the dull metalic red color, I was expecting a more vibrant red!If the color isnt important to you, it's great!"
5,Kerry,The shirt was just what my son want the color and quality is excellent. We are very happy because it's hard to gamer shirts in this size. Thank you. The service was also perfect received the order very fast.
3,"Something different, but that's it!","This book is nice to read and the pictures are well done.However, it does not really get deep into the matter. Inaccuracies in detail and the selection of the engines is not convincing in every aspect. Too much UK. However, this selection could have been limited by availability, as all engines were photographed in the UK.Some more technical information and more precise data about where the engines have been applied would have been good.The BMW 328 engine is declared a Bristol. That's a little bit difficult to accept as the Bristol was manufactured under license from BMW (or bought from BMW).A Corvette ZR-1-LT5 is NOT a Chey Small Block. They have the displacement in common, that's it. A standard watercooled Porsche 911-engine has the boxer-layout in common with the photographed aircooled-engine, but not the unique features described in the text.Nice to read for people who do not know much about this matter. Enthusiasts get dissapointed ."
3,Sababa Chess Set,"Unfortunately my product arrived damaged and the drawer seemed to be lacquered shut. The person I contacted was very prompt in his replies and very accommodating to what I wanted - either a refund or a replacement. However, I decided to order a chess set from another company that I liked better. The return went smoothly and I received a full refund."
2,Power problems plague EM-500,"I bought my EM-500 last fall and have had to send it back twice now for repairs. For some reason, out of the blue, it just refuses to either turn on, or remain on after a few minutes. There is a power update that I installed when I first got it but it doesn't seem to fix the problem at hand. If you're looking for dependency and reliablity, I defiantly wouldn't recommend the EM-500. I've lost all my data twice now (partly my fault because I didn't do a backup)."
5,GREAT TV / VCR,"I had it now for over two and half years , works great both the TV and VCR despite of all the abuse that VCR been through .........it's holding great !...............I recommend it for anyone yearning for the good old stuff."
5,Exactly what I wanted,"Exactly what I wanted: good quality, good condition, recommended. Not as warm as fleece, but perfect for less-than-bitter cold."
1,Not up to par with the rest of the Croscill Townhouse collection,"310TC ain't so hot - and for this price? And the non-border pattern on the sheet is kinda lame - not very ellegant. Luxury? No way. Get yourself a nice burgundy, gold or deep green set of sheets to match your Croscill Townhouse ensemble. These sheets ain't makin' it."
1,Beautiful... BUT....,"Unless you are into ironing your sheets, the boarder wrinkles & folds. I've had to send back two sets of pillow cases for excessive pilling. AND.... the worse, they don't fold straight. For the price, they should be perfectly squared. I bought a cheap set of sheets for $8.99 - they are my favs b/C they fold up PERFECTLY square!"
5,Best of all Louise tapes (in Spanish),"It is the best tape of Louise's in Spanish. They never had a version in CD, but if you ever get it, don't lose it. There are no more editions of this version, even in tape."
3,"The best song is a cover? Say it ain't so, John&John!","Imagine a weary, frazzled synthesis between John Henry & Apollo 18, and you're getting close to what this album is about. Its a stylistic step backwards -- they are wearing out, getting bored. Indeed, the best song on this album is a cover (Cub's NYC). John & John are wizards, and I love them and their work dearly -- but nothing would suit TMBG better than a long, long break. They need to find their love for music and get creative once again."
5,A must-buy!,"Don't listen to the reviewer when he labels each song as some type of parody or satire, this is They Might Be Giants's own unique style, and it's fabulous!"
5,TMBG are Awesome,"Factory Showroom was one of the later TMBG Cd's I listened to. I didn't think that it would sound as good as their older Cd's. I was completly off track. This is probably one of my favorite Cd's by TMBG. It includes so many great songs. What's really good about it is that they have a full band backing up the John's. I think that a lot of the songs off this Cd could be considered classic TMBG songs. My favorites are ""The Bells are Ringing,"" ""Till my head falls off,"" and""Your own worst enemy."""
5,My Metal Detector Is With Me All Of The Time...,"""Factory Showroom"" is TMBG's 6th album, and it's quite... different than the others. In fact, one of the songs on the album, ""Pet Name"", is not one of my favorites. In fact, one of my favorites is... well, the name of this review should tip you off.Anyways, a great album."
5,A Great Album!,"This is a great album! ""Till my head falls off"" is easily my favorite of all. It's not an album to start off with though. I disagree with the people who say with album lacks creativity and integrity, especially if you look at songs like, ""Spiraling Shape"", ""S-E-X-X-Y"", ""Metal Detector"", ""Till My Head Falls Off"", and others. This is a great album to buy!"
5,"Way better than Flood, A haiku Review","A very cool discIt is quite entertainingbuy this right awayThey might be giantsDo not buy flood, it's awfulFlood, their only bad"
2,Meh.,"This was an album purchase that would have been better as a ""buy a couple tracks"" purchase. I really liked ""James K. Polk"" and ""Exquisite Dead Guy,"" but that was it. The songs that try to be more rock, like ""S-E-X-X-Y"" and ""XTC vs Adam Ant,"" are just too slow. The former even pauses pretty often, which is a fine thing to do if there's, you know, MUSIC the rest of the time. It's just a lot of foreplay without getting to the deed, you know? You're basically waiting for the song to start the whole time and it just never does.The rest of the tracks are just a loose, lazy, bubblegum pop that I really don't care for."
1,Piece of junk,"I bought this DVD player at Sam's Club. Not clear on any HDMI selection of 480, 720 or 1080. Also made the wide screen picture even narrower than my old dvd player (at least half the size). No good qualities. Its going back."
3,Great picture poor sound,"I purchased this DVD player as Sam's. I am runnig it at 1080i into a Vizio 37"". The picture is great, but the sound is too quiet. We have to watch movies at max volume and it is still too quiet, whereas cable is at 20-30%, and plenty loud. I have not used the remote since I am using a RF wireless which has worked well. I suppose it is OK for what I paid, but I should have spent $30 more for a better model."
1,Lasted less than 4 months,"I got what I paid for. It was on sale in December 2007 and I picked it up for $30. I paid too much as it only lasted until April 11th, 2008. The video went out. Even before then the video quality was adequate at best but not as good as others I've compared it to, plus the sound was weak. Plus had virtually no features. Next time I won't buy my electronics at a discount store."
4,learning curve,"with this product, there is a learning curve...as with all dvd players, you have to adjust the settings for your liking...the price of this player and the quality I get from it is amazing...I have to agree with the reviewer who said he needed to set it up for best results...if you are the type of person that can not figure out how to set up electronic devises, THEN READ THE MANUAL!!!the hd tv I have only displays up to 1080i...but the quality isn't very good..that's because it is interlaced and I am used to pro-scan...so I receive a better picture at 720p...so play with the settings and you'll be happy at the price point..and as for running it directly through your tv...don't expect the sound from a tv channel...IT IS A DIFFERENT SIGNAL ALL TOGETHER!!!run it through your stereo for best results... for 50 bucks you can't beat this player..."
2,"Good intentions, falls short","Like another reviewer, I was disappointed that none of these families reflects the reality for so many children: you can have two mommies, or two daddies. ""Mom and her partner"" not only doesn't come close to describing families with two moms, it undermines one of the child's primary relationships.And I just found it rather boring. There's no plot. Most children would much rather read a story, and I'd much rather they saw a variety of families within stories instead of having this friendly little lecture."
1,I really don't like this book,"As a white single mother of a bi-racial child, I'm always excited to find books that validate our family's composition. The problem with this one is that the main character whose family begins the book is a white girl who lives with her two white parents and sibling, has a dog and white grandparents. So the set-up is that her family is the ""regular"" kind and others are variations that aren't quite the same and are kind of exotic. I don't read this to my daughter anymore and I plan to throw it away."
5,great book,its such a great story to teach children about all the different types of family and they can also see how they look.
4,Silver,Fairly durable and real looking. A nice alternative to the typical white utencils. Matched nicely with the rest of the rehearsal dinner decor.
5,Great for company or a holiday,"I love to entertain, but I don't have a set for 20 of flatware. This is a wonderful compromise. It looks like REAL silver, is a true statement. It is really pretty, and it is durable. You could easily re-wash it an use it again."
3,NOT HEAVYWEIGHT!,"My dispute is not with the product but with its description. The utensils are attractive enough and functional, but the descriptors ""heavyweight"" and ""list price"" are deceptive. This plastic flatware is not heavyweight; in fact it is about the weight of far cheaper utensils. It fits the purpose, however, and the forks do not break with normal usage."
3,SHORT FORKS,THEY ARE NICE AND LOOK LIKE REAL SILVERWARE BUT THE FORK WAS SHORT AND THEY WEREN'T AS HEAVY AS I THOUGHT THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN.
5,Very nice silverware,"I've seen these at parties and conferences before so I decided to find them on amazon and low and behold i found some! Great stuff, definitely will buy some again in the future."
4,Great Plasticware That Looks Fancy,"I got these for a baby shower and they worked very well. They look much nicer than traditional plastic forks and knives, and they are sturdy too."
5,Awesome deal!,"This was an awesome deal compared to getting off other websites and party stores. Although the boxes were open and a little tattered, the plasticware was fine."
4,Fooled my neighbor,"So I had taken the flatware out of its' box and it was on my kitchen counter, when my neighbor walked in, looked at it, and asked why I was using my grandmother's good silverware for a casual baby shower! Now, granted, she was a bit across the room, but still! My only comment on the negative side, but it's a quibble of the product wording, is that it is by no means ""heavyweight."" Doesn't feel any sturdier than any good quality plastic ware. But I'm happy with it."
4,"Looks, but not a lot of substance","If you want the look of real silverware, this is what you want, BUT I don't know where they get off calling them ""heavy weight."" They are not. I bought two brands (the other was ""Silver Reflections"" from Webstaurant. com.)Comparing them side by side they are almost identical in design and weight(the Comet brand may have SLIGHTLY stronger tines)BUT the Comet is superior in finish. The other brand had worn black spots where they had rubbed together and imperfections that the Comet brand did not have. I did not find any brand that looked like silverware that was truly heavy weight, so if you're serving steak, fuggetaboutit."
4,Elegant Plastic Knives and Forks,"If you are having a big party where you are going to use plastic K&Fs and you want it to look elegant for a change, try these. Until you touch them you can't tell it's plastic. Makes a great looking table. Used these for a holiday party for 40 and was very pleased the way the table settings looked. I'll being using these again come the next holiday season."
4,Can't beat the price,We had looked at the same product in stores and found the same quality for a MUCH better price here. Completely happy with the purchase.
4,Look Nice,These look nice but are not any more hardcore than your regular ole flimsy disposable flatware. I guess I was expecting them to be a little bit sturdier for the price.
3,"Item is OK, but vendor way overpriced it","After I received this order, I found the exact same item for about half the price at my local warehouse store. I would have returned it, but the shipping cost made it not worth it. The item itself was fine, what I expected, although could have been of a heavier weight for the price (even the warehouse store price). But it did fool everyone, and made the table look nice. I would buy it again for large family holiday dinners, but not from this vendor."
3,Eh,Didn't tell me much that I didn't already know. I could've saved myself some money and googled the subject instead and gotten all the information provided in this book for free. If you're new to going organic with cosmetics and skin care then this would be a good book for you. If you're a veteran it's not going to give you any new information.
5,First of the Maddoc & Janet series ...,Quirky & likeable (also hate-able) characters in a small Canadian community beset by a mysterious death & several other strange happenings. Introduces Maddoc & Janet and her family and home. GREAT series!
5,Funny and Perpetual,"I like to open this book now and again to make my day, the illustrations are great and the advise is all that you've heard and more, plus some fun facts. It's a very retro book but at the same time it just teaches you a big lesson: everyone gives advice but no one really knows what they're talking about."
2,"Off color, good product","The punch itself is a good product, I purchased it because of the great price, but the shipping was more than the product so it was not such a bargain. Also, it was listed as magenta which I thought would be a pink hue, but it is actually violet. I am pleased with the punch, but disappionted in the color. I thought it was a good price, but the shipping charges blew that idea."
4,"Great system, crappy accessory selection","Just got a EM-500 and I love it. But I was shocked to learn that no one makes a keyboard for the system - folding or otherwise. I've even called the manfacturers, and they say they have no plans to make one. So if you want to add something along those lines, look for a different pocket PC."
2,"A lot of pictures, horrible language","This book contains a lot of Francis Bacon's works, which is great. However, the language is terrible: Every sentence is unnaturally long, and it's a real pain to read. I recommend finding a different book if you're interesting in reading more about Bacon."
5,Excellent Book,"I couldn't believe how hard I was laughing the minute I picked up this book. The author's humor is unprecedented and genuine. His portrayal of row-home life in Philadelphia is uncanny and especially entertaining to someone familiar with the area. Even though it is hilarious, it also has depth and the cocky 13-year-old really touches you. Apparently I'm related to the author, so if you're reading this, I'm dieing to meet you."
2,Skip this one...,"I grew up in NE Philly, and can identify every single place this author writes about (the only reason it gets 2 stars from me). But the thrill wears off quickly, and you're left with a stale, repetitive contrived book with only a few funny scenes. The language is overused, the plot is flat, the characters predictable. I kept reading thinking that it was going to get better but it doesn't. It evokes those fond memories of bikerides through the park, and spending all summer out with your friends, ending your nights with games of Freedom. But unless you're overly nostalgic, there are much better books to devote your time to that are actually stimulating."
1,"Two words, my bad!","Shawn McBride has given credence to the term ""philthadelphia."" Anyone who thought that philadelphia was the armpit of the nation, will now be convinced. I don't know what street he grew up on, but it sure wasn't mine! One star for the one time i laughed out loud. Unfortunately, by the end of the book, i couldn't remember what it was that made me laugh. By the way, the term ""my bad,"" was never used in that decade."
5,Holy cow - this book is FUNNY!,"Green Grass Grace has got to be one of most hilarious books I have picked up in years. I haven't been this blown away by an adolescent protagonist since CATCHER IN THE RYE.McBride tells the story of 13-year-old Henry Toohey and his childhood adventures in 1984 Philadelphia. The book is both sharp and soft, as Henry's expletive-filled mouth tells a rather beautiful story of the search for love and hope within his Irish-American family. His journey is entertaining enough but the wit with which the story is narrated makes it all worth while, maybe even more than the immortalized Holden Caufield (Holden would be unlikely to compose a sonnet to breasts--that should give you a flavor of what is going on here.) The story is filled with surprises and treats that will have you laughing to yourself long after you've put the book down.I hate it when I can't fine books this good in hardback; I've already read it three times. Buy this book and enjoy yourself!"
3,This boxed set not what it seems to be,"The exact same picture of Jordi Savall appears on a boxed set available in Europe, with 8 CDs, and the title Espana Antigua. Much of the music in the European edition is medieval and troubador. Careless shoppers may not be aware of the difference, since this Angel release (2005) only contains 5 CDs, and mixes and matches different music. Why do Americans rate dumbed down editions, where the individual CDs in this set don't even carry titles (Espana Antigua CDs do)? At the very least, Amazon should call people's attention to the possible misunderstanding. The European edition (Virgin 2001 - Hesperion XX performing), as might be expected, is much more costly. Here we have no idea who is performing, although it might well be Hesperion"
5,5 cds for $20 or less of good stuff,"This 5 disc set has gotten some good reviews. It has some of the same material as the Espana Antigua 8 disc set (not available except by import), and some different material. (See listings of material in photo section). Disc 6 and 7 in the 8 disc Espana Antigua are the same as Discs 1 and 2 in this 5 disc set.As the original reviewer mentioned - the same picture is used on both sets but they are significantly different - so beware. Some discs in the sets appear to be identical (I don't have the Espana Antigua set)- and these discs have gotten good reviews (check out amazon uk site for reviews of Espana Antigua). The enitre 5 disc set listed here gets a ""bargain"" assessment from medieval dot org.I figure it is Jordi (early Jordi when he was on EMI in the 1980s - but still...), and it is 5 discs worth for the price of about one disc. Definitely a bargain. And wonderful music - Savall doing chamber music!"
2,OK but not great,"A set of songs from the female wing of the Scandanavian garage rock genre. While the ladies are highly competent and the songs well constructed, the disc comes across as a bit flat and somewhat uninspired.I kept waiting for the boundless enthusiasm and ""I don't give a care"" atttitude that is more-or-less required for this type of music to work. Instead, I came away with the impression that I was listening to the performance of a band that had been on the road a bit too long and had started to simply go through the motions. It's possible that this was exacerbated by the production; the sound being boxed and lifeless."
1,NEVER RECIEVED!,"This item was never shipped to me, and the Seller did respond to any of my emails asking to advise on this item and delivery. BAD EXPERIENCE, DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!"
2,"Excellent CD, misleading description","This album took me by surprise. It'a a lot more cohesive and solid than their first CD.That said, the description is misleading. It says ""two bonus tracks ('Don't Drop That Dime' and 'Re-Evolution') plus a bonus DVD featuring a documentary."" What it doesn't say is that the bonus track, ""Re-Evolution"" is actually the DVD. So, it actually contains one bonus track and a DVD. I'd recommend grabbing the normal version if you are torn between the two"
1,Inaccurate account of the life a major mystic.,Joel Goldsmith never wanted a human biography. His autobiography he considered A Parenthesis in Eternity. This book relates selective information that may mislead and disappoint a serious mystical student. It would be better for students to read Joel Goldsmith's own works. This account would have saddened Mr. Goldsmith as much as it saddened his widow and family. The veil will never be allowed to obscure the truth again
2,Great songs. Lyrics? Not so much.,"It's funny. I like Kurt's singing. And the band is wonderful. But unlike the amazing lyricists of the past. These lyrics are forced into a melodic structure without much finesse. It reminds me of forced humor. You know, the guys on morning radio being forced to attempt to be funny every day. With the result being NOT FUNNY! This feels the same to me. A little presumptous to assume any of these composers of these great tunes ever wanted or imagined them vocalized by anyone. I remember Mark Murphy pulling it off 30 years ago pretty well. But this just doesn't make it. And the banana song is mind boggling. Guess I'll have to stick to Kurt doing standards."
3,Great Music Undermined by Weak Lyrics,"I think Kurt Elling is a great singer. I've seem him give two phenomenal live performances and have enjoyed his previous recordings. His latest CD, however, does not show him at his best. The jazz compositions used are excellent and not overly familiar, but Elling's lyrics do not serve them well. I cringe most at the hackneyed use of KHATMANDU and TIMBUKTU in MINUANO, so much so that I can't enjoy the excellent arrangement and vocal performance. THE MORE I KNOW YOU suffers from comparison to THE MORE I SEE YOU, a song with simple, unforced, but carefully wrought lyrics Elling would do well to study. I suggest he find a co-writer. Lorraine Feather would be wonderful in that capacity!"
2,Problematic,"This Time It's Love was KE's best album to date because it showcased him as a great singer of songs, and cut back on the corny side of jazz-hands vocalese nonsense that is unbearable to these ears.The butchering of Trane is somewhat lessened by the fact that it is a monstrous undertaking to learn how to sing that music, and to do it well. But one may wonder what the point of this type of recreationist interpretation is, especially given that Kurt is prone to denigrate far better musicians than himself, ie Wynton, for allegedly raping the past.At any rate, Elling is about the best there is in male jazz vocalists, and I hope he learns to refine his tastes to better musical choices, and hopefully, finally, a new piano player."
4,New Fan,"I had heard of Kurt Elling, but never actually HEARD him. Happened to run into a song by him on internet radio. Was blown away by his phrasing, smoothness. The next day, I went to my local store & found just this sole CD, not even knowing that it was new. Nor did I wonder if it contained the 1 song I had heard. It din't matter. But as I fought to unwrap the packaging, I told myself: ""this better be worth buying unheard"". The very 1st cut started a little slow (for me), but picked up 1/2 way through. The rest of the CD left me hungering for more. Where have I been all my life??"
5,All that Elling!,"The Previous review comments on the use of ""Kathmandu"" and ""Timbukti"" as though they undermine the Metheny/Elling piece, Minuano. This, in my opinion is an inaccuarate observation.In truth, jazz is one of the only genres of music that can afford to use silly lyrics, without sounding premature or overly unserious. The obvious rhyme of kathmandu and timbuktu may seem banal if heard alone in the chorus, but anyone who chooses to comment on the lyrics of a song must listen to the lyrics in their specific context. Kurt obviously explores all facets of human experience: admiration, desire, imagination --which leads to metaphor upon metaphor, then hope, then realisation of love, then, then the determination to capture the unrequited love, more hope, and finally the culmination of love discovered.Nothing personal Ken, but try listening to Minuano along with the rest of the lyrics. It is a masterpiece poem...and Man in the Air is a wonderful compendium of soul grub.RECOMMEND!!"
1,unhappy,"This product is not as pictured.It is a thin , flat stick.Vender will not issue full credit when returned."
1,not very comprehensive,"I was excited to read this book but was very disappointed with the content. It only covered the ""top"" known auto-immune diseases and did not even mention the others that we suffer from. I am still trying to collect any info I can about mine....Takayasu's arteritis. I was so sad to see that it wasn't mentioned or anything close to it. Alot of the author's comments were the same in each chapter and quite repetitive without much insight."
5,HIS BEST,I SAW BOBBY SHORT SING THESE VERY SAME SONGS AT THE CAFE CARLYLE LAST YEAR. IT IS HIS BEST WORK. HIS VOICE IS LIKE SINATRA'S IN THAT IT HAS MELLOWED OVER THE YEARS. AN AMERICAN ICON.
5,A Great Book!,"I'm a huge fan of the Clearwater Crossing series. I really liked this book. Even though Eight Prime earned enough $$ to buy the bus for the Junior Explorers, they decided to stay together. Seeing Jenna and Peter react to their kiss was interesting, and Melanie and Jesse may be getting closer than we expected. I can't wait to read the next book in the series. If you want to talk about the series, feel free to email me."
4,Book Review,"Well balanced, thoughtful and well argued. It is a very straightforward apologetic in defense of the Bible being God's word."
4,DISHING WITH DISNEY (SO TO SPEAK),"Okay, so ""gourmet"" may be a bit of a stretch but `Mickey's Gourmet Cookbook"" does hold some very, very good recipes, and it's a must for Disneyana collectors and fans of Disney period.The over 350 recipes include beverages, breads, appetizers, salads, entrees, desserts and sauces. There's a Shogun dinner from EPCOT Center sparked with ginger and mustard sauces.Chocaholics will relish the Chocolate Amaretto Mousse from the Disneyland Hotel. Apropos from Disney's Caribbean Resort are crunchy Caribbean Sand Bars filled with nuts and chocolate chips.If your kids are picky eaters - try dishing up some Disney and see what happens.- Gail Cooke"
2,Sounds good at least.,"The Air Charger comes with an actual dyno report ""proving"" that it makes more power on a 6.0 Chevy Ls2 engine. You won't be able to feel the difference however. It sounds very cool though and is easily inspected unlike the stock intake. With all the resonators removed, the intake sound on an Ls2 is very deep and impressive. If I had known what to expect I would not have bought it."
2,no sub title of close caption,"I can't believe that this dvd don't have sub-titles or close caption....just English spoken language, WHERE IS THE CONSIDERATION FOR THE HANDICAPPED?"
2,Don't buy this!,"We mistakenly thought that the Gigi Hard Wax with Floral Passions was the same as the older Gigi Brazilian Hard Wax only with some perfume in it. Wrong! It looks the same, but does not work the same. The Floral Passions does not harden enough for it to come off cleanly. We found that the Floral Passions tended to stay ""gooey"" so that it had to be pulled off in little pieces, greatly increasing the pain level. I don't understand why they felt the need to ""improve"" something that worked fine. Get the Gigi Brazilian Hard Wax if you can find it. Floral Passions equals more pain in our book!"
1,Stick with the original formula this one does not work,"I got this after the can the warmer came with ran out (Gigi Brazilian Hard Body Wax). It smells great but does not work well, it remains soft and gooey no matter how thin or thick you apply it, I even left it on longer and still it would not harden. I ended up with a patchy job and a sticky mess I had to use loads of oil to remove. I only gave 1 star because of the smell."
2,Leaves a lot to be desired,"I am not thrilled with this product. While it smells great, it's also a sticky mess that's hard to pull off so it stays stuck on your skin, along with the hair. Not so fun. I won't purchase it again but had a much better experience with GIGI Hard brazilian wax."
2,"Cute, but terrible inner lining","While this is an adorable costume, the inside is lined with an extremely rough and scratchy material-similar to the kitchen sponges wrapped in the rough netting meant for scrubbing pans. My daughter can only wear it if she wears long sleeves and pants underneath which is even more uncomfortable since we live in a very warm climate. Overall, Cute, but the material is much to rough for anyones skin."
3,Thompson Center Sling Swivels w/Brass Thimbles,the screw did not fit my gun i had to make a trip to the machine shop for a tap job now it works fine
1,"Decent recording, terrific artists...","fatally marred by the cheapest cardboard CD case imaginable and stuck with Sony's illegal DRM sofwtare that installs spyware on Windows computers without your permission. (Is there any limit to these idiots' greed?)If you can possibly find another printing of this CD, get that instead."
1,Sorry but no!,I have been and continue to be a great fan of Oscar Peterson but this just didn't work for me and I deleted in total less than a day after download.
1,When The Wind Blows,"I don't know why some books on CD skip around chapters. When I load the first disc, I have to find chapter 1, then it might skip to 34 or some other trac. I tried it in our portable CD player and it does the same thing. I am new to books on CD and am not sure if they all do this? Fortunately, I am able to keep the story line in my mind, otherwise it would be very frustrating to listen to.Other than that problem, sound quality is excellent and there are no scratches on the CD's. The packaging is in very good condition and the shipping was very fast. I would buy from this vendor (on Amazon) again.Michele"
1,Pitiful,"Horrible book.Islamic literature is distinct in that information can be classified into 'authentic','fabricated', 'weak', as well as many other categories by rigourously analyzing the chains of narration.The author did not bother with that and, it seems, assumed that whatever he quoted from some book of history (say, Tarikh Tabari) was authentic.Save your $$$, and buy something more credible and scholarly (e.g. Al-Bidaya wal-Nihaya)."
2,Good while it lasted - about 2 years,"Worked well for about 2 years. Then after storage in the house - fired it up and no AC voltage output. Tested it with a known good light bulb. Makes noise, indicator light is on, fuse looks good, just no AC. Open the bottom of the case - corrosion all over the place. Seems like they did not clean off the solder flux in manufacture, perhaps causing a bad join somewhere. More gifts from China now in the landfill. RayOVac seems to be having quality issues lately."
5,awesome leash,Love this leash. It is not only stylish but actually holds up in larger surf (4 feet). Feels sturdy. Highly recommend this.
3,got old fast,My son was more intereted in the box than the toy after playing with it for a few minutes. He is 2 and it was a gift at 1 1/2. He won't play with it anymore.
4,Good Fun,"I wouldn't have bought this piano, but Toys R us was having a deal where it came free with another toy I bought.ProsLIGHT UP KEYSThe light up keys encourage my son to press them and interact with the piano.TWO MODESIt has two modes that allow the music to play in ""animal"" or ""piano"" sounds.PLEASANT SOUNDThe musical tone is very pleasant, and not too loud.ConsCLOSE WIRESI think the wires may be a little close together for his unpracticed hands. Maybe it will teach him better coordination, though.GLITCHThe piano occassionaly glitches and makes dischordant sounds until you turn it off."
2,Boring Toy,"Our baby got this piano when he was 9 mths. old, and he still plays with it but it is boring. I don't feel that it challenges him at all, and he gets bored with it more quickly than any other toys. The music does sound awful, and the keys don't allow individual play (they don't play a note when they hit the key, just continue a song). I wouldn't recommend this toy."
3,terrible but my daughter loves it,"My daughter recieved this toy for her first birthday and immediately I noticed its tone was bad. But she was enthralled and we played with it more. If your child presses the keys to play the song, it will play a bar or two and then stop until she presses another key. With each note, a different key lights up. After a while, I noticed the tone seemed to be better if you pressed the right key for the next note in the song. But since there are more notes in the song than keys on the board, the ""right"" key could be anywhere! Impossible to predict. Still, I cannot think they'd expect 6-36 month olds to predict the next key...So, I went to check out others of this same piano at the store. All of them have the same slurring noise. It's horrible to listen to, but none the less, my daughter really enjoys this toy. I just put it on the animal setting and walk away. But...I would not buy this toy again should it break nor would I buy this toy for somebody else's child."
1,Worthless,"I have worked with WebSphere for over two years, and this book makes some of the worst fundamental assumptions about Java, the power of Big Blue, and the overall direction object oriented technology is going. The book consists of misspelled words, poor examples, and countless programming errors. I really have no idea what qualifications Mr. Worden has regarding IBM products, but my advice to him is that he should actually learn the material he is writing about before he decides to preach from the pulpit about it."
3,Goood CD,"ok this cd does hit the spot if your new to the world of anything that is not on TRL. In my opinion this CD as well as the ATARIS ""Blue Skies, Broken Hearts... Next 12 Exits"" (1999) kindof served as a gateway to music of some substance. Now i am into stuff that i wouldve thrown out the window when i first heard this CD. But overall this CD does go over smooth. expecially if you are into the pop blink-182 good charollete and of course the simple plan. but not all will like this album. maybe a bit weird, cause this is more emo than punk. But the best tracks areYOU VANDAL-you probably wont like this track at first but if u get hooked you will like itHOLLY HOW FORGET ME NOT-catchy intro, pretty good songTHE VAST SPOILS OF AMERICA-good songTHIRD ENGINE-starts off ok but gets a lot betterTHROUGH BEING COOL-good goood song, was instantly my favorite upon first hearing but after awhile i started liking the other ones"
1,CRAP,"This album is horrible. Me and my friends totally agree on that. I was really wanted this album to be good. What has happened to Punk Rock. I can't belive this trash. If you want some good punk buy lagwagon(old),Guttermouth,or if you want emopunk get the ataris. Stear clear of this no melody it is just horrible!!!!!!"
2,This Is Garbage,"Saves the Day, another one of those so-called pop/punk bands, is definately a band you can skip. They are so overated and their lead singer is really annoying with his whiney voice. This cd is (...) and if you wanna hear some good bands then buy a cd from good bands like The Ataris, Blink, or Junction 18. That is all."
5,best cd i've bought in a long time,this is a great cd. it's worth every dollar. i'm sick of all those 'hardcore punks' dissing saves the day cause they're aren't 'punk enough'. whatever. like someone said in another review at first you'll listen through it and just be like ok.. and then after awhile you'll keep listening to it and listening to it and wanting more. this is a must have.
5,"A Great, Great CD","This album is a non-stop barrage of incredible! The heartfelt emotion found on Can't Slow Down definitely IS still there, and the songwriting/arranging has matured, making this an all around BETTER album! One of the best I've bought in a long time."
4,INTERESTING COLLECTION,"I odered this collection a long time ago thinking it was all jazz. However, what it does is mix a lot of classical pieces with a few bebop nos. of Parker & Gillespie with some easy listening with Kaempfert (Doc Severinsen). Today I am just playing it for the first timke, & guess what? I really like it!I may order a few more of the Telarc Collections, which are billed as the world's finest sounding (impt.) recordings.Just thought you might be interested & thank you kindly for reading my ""review."""
2,clicking out patterns,"Basic steps but cause Hasluck was Mr. Popular Mechanic of the day, you can find better information is in Swayzeland's 1905 Boot and Shoe Manufacture book."
3,Own a Chevy? Don't want to advertise for the dealer?,"Well, it's made of metal. Looks about like the picture. I wondered what was meant by domed. I'm still not sure. The name and emblem are made of plastic. If you looked at the plastic from either end, the profile would look someting like the letter D. If you turn a D on its side I guess it looks kind of like a dome.Its well made and adequate... but I expected a little more for $18. Maybe my gauge is off. Of course what I really wanted was in the $40 to $50 range, so maybe this was a good deal!"
5,The Conquering Lion....,"A friend turned me onto this and from that day I was hooked!!! The '70s were really the birth of modern reggae, which came out of R&B, Rock Steady, and Ska. Coming out of the same neighborhodd in Kingston as Marley and Macin(Tosh), Winston Rodney, The Burning Spear, had the same class sensiblities and realization of the power of Rastafarianism and the struggles of the downtrodden in Jamaica and elsewhere. The sounds has really changed over the years and this is where it started. A must have for any real reggae fan. Slavery days says it all...."
4,The good stuff,"Must admit i've never been much of a Burning Spear fan before. I don't care for the jam band stuff they play now or the genre as a whole. That said these two records are nothing like the later jam band stuff. This cd holds its own with other roots reggae from the same era. It has a good sound somewhat militant, not as much as Tosh, not as catchy as other records from this time frame. But a solid effort that won't dissapoint."
4,Burning Spear- Militant Chants and Rock Hard Riddims,"Actually, it is not quite true to state that ""This was where it all started for Burning Spear""- Burning Spear actually started recording for Studio One some years before. But this probably was the first Burning Spear album, and the first time Burning Spear's music was widely heard outside Jamaica (I'm guessing).I first heard this CD playing in a store- by that time it had reached the ""Garvey's Ghost"" part. I was impressed by the quality of the music. Later on, after I bought it, I still liked the ""Garvey's Ghost"" album a lot but the vocals took time to grow on me. These are not clever reggae pop tunes like those crafted by Bob Marley and for this reason are probably not as easily accessible as Marley's songs, but if you really like reggae I believe repeated listening will reveal the glory of these tracks."
3,Better Edition of the Acting Person,"The Vatican has attempted to halt continued dissemination of the only English edition of The Acting Person with good reason. Apparently, it is not a faithful translation of Karol Wojtyla/John Paul II's Polish original. The translator, who is herself a phenomenologist but thinks differently from the author has changed crucial passages of his work. The second Polish edition which has been translated into French and Spanish is apparently accurate, for those who can read those languages. I myself am looking for one of these, preferably Spanish, but have not been able to find one. Two good overviews of Karol Wojtyla's philosophical anthropology can be found in Kenneth Schmitz's At the Center of the Human Drama and Jaroslaw Kupczak's Destined for Liberty."
4,The one who seeks the truth seeks God!,This text is well presented by the publisher and its contents do inform the reader on the classical thought patterns and their underlying philosophical presuppositions that made Pope John-Paul II the man of our times who was and is an intellectual and spiritual force to be recond with.
5,Where to get this book,"Greetings! I know of one bookseller in Canada who has a copy of this book. If you are still interested, here is his e-mail: bookstore@regent-college.edu"
5,Best Book for Starters!,"Three years ago, my father gave me this book on Christmas Eve when I told him that at the age of 27 I was already for a career change. I was already a CAD-man and I wanted to do more then just industrial wire frames. I was ready to take my work to new levels and other worlds. Someone in the know suggested this book to him.This book goes through everything a new comer to Computer Animation and world building needs to know when starting out: What to look for when buying a computer, how software packages stack up against each other, and how functions work.I read this book that Christmas Day and agian the following weekend there after and have referred back to it ever since. It's one of my most treasured possessions, reminding me the enormous faith my father has in me. And, it's a nice resource...This is a good book to get someone started and a refresher for 'old timers' like myself. This book in invaluable!"
4,"1:30, NOT 1:40 scale","1:30 scale makes this toy bigger, which is nice if it is the only one you are purchasing, but if you want a set of undersea creatures, they should all be the same scale, especially from the same makers. I bought elasmosaurus and kronosaurus and elasmosaurus is at 1:40, whereas Kronosaurus is at 1:30, so it is too big, relative to my other one. Also, the detail seems less compared to the smaller elasmosaurus. By itself though, it is a great toy: solid and durable. My future children will love it, but it's mine for now!"
4,Charles V,"Published in 1943 by Creative Age Press, this is an historical novel about the 16th century Hapsburg Royale, Charles V, King of Spain, etc, Holy Roman Emperor, father of Phillip II. Written in the leisurely, sober style of the genre in those days, it is historically as accurate as these things get. If not an absolute Must read for those interested in the period and persons, certainly a good one. (Sorry,no bodice ripping.)(Trivia: each page of the Look Inside preview warns that one is looking over Copyrighted Material. Altho the current publishers are doubtless welcome to pick up, scan, re-print, and re-publish stuff that's fallen out of Copyright, one wonders what sort of rights are thereby vested in them..?? )"
5,Absolutely stellar!,"I have worked through this book and can't say enough good things about it. If you're ready to truly expand your creativity this is the book for you. I have learned how to recognize when my shadow is getting in the way of my progress, and how to use the knowledge to keep growing. If you are honest with yourself, do the exercises and keep going even when it's scary you too can integrate your shadow and improve your life. There's also a CD with Rosanne reading the guided imageries to you - highly recommend it too."
3,only 2 actual reviews for this book -,Please consider the reviews for this book contain (3) from A CUSTOMER nearly 1 month apart for each and (2) from L MINTZ. It seems there is something fishy here.
5,"wow, this album is beautiful","Southern Gal by Terry Ellis is a very nice album. I owned two copies of it and gave the other copy to a friend who's never heard of the singer and after he listened to it he said he was pleased and enjoyed it very much from beginning to end. there'sno need to skip or forward any tracks on southern gal. Terry's voice is very soothing and the music is relaxing. Best songs include: ""Wherever You Are,"" ""I Don't Wanna Wait Till Tomorrow,"" ""It's You That I Need,"" and ""It Ain't Over (Till It's Over)."" And there's even more great songs to be discovered on this CD as well. She can hold her own and sing just great alone without her fellow En Vogue singers: Cindy, Dawn and Maxine. Terry's solo album is far better than Dawn's. It's the kind of album you can listen to over and over and never get tired of. Get this cd today if you don't already have it!"
4,YOU GO TERRY.,"Terry was my favorite member of the group En Vogue and I always thought she was the best singer of the group until I realized it was Dawn. Southern Gal is a laid back, mid-tempo album the brings forth another side of Terry. On this solo album, she really pushes her vocals and she proves that she can make it on her own. Unfortunately, this album didn't really sell because of the bad promotion. Overall, this album is really nice if you like the laid back grooves."
1,"I really wanted to like it, but.......","I remember a released song from this album that I really liked back in the day, so I added a used version of this CD to my basket to meet the ""free shipping"" total. I only paid 2-3 dollars for it and really, really wanted to like it. The truth is....it sucks. I like Terry's voice. It's beautiful, but these songs just aren't good. My Honey thought it was pure torture to make him sit through the album, as I waited for the song I liked. I couldn't remember the name of it, because it came out so long ago. iTunes pulled the tracks in, but played them in backwards order. Unfortunately it was track 3. LOL! After we listened to that song, we turned it off."
2,High School Confidential,"Someone recommended this to me - I thought it was pretty bad. It was definitely sad what happened to the victims, but it's so sensationalized, a la ""High School Confidential."" I couldn't even finish it and don't recommend it."
5,Great Speaker,The author John Chaffetz is a great speaker!!! I thought he was not trying to scare anyone just make us more aware. My eyes opened up after I heard him speak & to top it off I was also a victim of assault after I heard him speak . PLEASE LISTEN TO HIM SPEAK!!!
4,FC Barcelona Champions of Europe 2006,"A very nice compilation of all the matches that Barcelona played enroute to winning the title in Paris. Highly recommended. Only that disc 1 was mostly in Spanish, with some translation in English. A good collection."
4,Best you've never heard,"I was surprised by this CD and ended up buying 2 more by ODDS. 'Good Weird Feeling' is my favorite by far. In particular the song 'Eat My Brain' is one of those that you will hear in your for head for a week after the first time you play it. The band has retained that certain garage band type feel, but is well polished and hook laiden as any other 'well know' band out there. They are an undiscovered gem."
5,alternative music fan from WI,highly recommended this and all of odds collection. smart lyrics and garage band sound!
5,It Skipped,"The songs are great, The only thing is the CD I received Skipped, Other than that this is a wonderful CD. I would recommend it to everyone."
1,"Cute boots, bad company.","I got the boots over 2 months after I ordered them from a woman I don't know. The company sent them to the wrong address (but mine was on the order correctly) and after she had called the phone number on the reciept repeatedly and getting no response, she shipped them on to me. Horribly done business if you ask me, but the shoes are cute."
4,Not too shabby!,"I bought this for travel, but have used for walking and everything else. The only thing I don't like about it is that there is only one way to charge it, and if you want it to last its max time (about 3.5 hrs.) you must let it charge up for about that long and refrain from doing a lot of clicking and selecting while in play mode. The radio works pretty well, but uses A LOT of energy to use. The sounds are clear and crisp and it is just the cutes thing! It also holds up to like 30 songs and regular files also. I think for the price and all you get you can't beat it with any other MP3 player."
3,Half / Half,"got this mp3 player about 2 days ago, im pretty impressed by the size and audio quality. a 30min charge can last u the rest of the day. it works well and is great for the gym, however there are a few cons.-it is almost impossible to see the screen in sunlight- theres no way of knowing when it is fully charged as the battery keeps showing that it is fulling up but never actually reaches full- comes with a cd thats completely useless and unneeded- using the radio completely kills the battery and the thing goes off without any warningapart from the above mentioned its definately worth your money"
4,A Forest Full of Strange Trees,"If you are familiar with folk tales you may understand Into the Forest. Anthony Brown has cleverly designed a journey through the woods to grandmother's house that sets up familiar expectations and raises more questions than it answers. The book invokes the anxieties of childhood, particularly feeling lost and wondering where one's parents have disappeared to -- a bit like a bad dream where nothing actually happens. The forest is exquisitely drawn in grey pencil. Every leaf is perfectly placed on the forest floor, while the wild trees tangle together above. The longer you look, the more you see -- strange forms and figures, many recognizable from folk tales, are hidden in the tree shapes. Although I am intrigued by this book, I would only sit down to read it with my child when I am feeling secure and ready to talk with him about his anxieties and strange dreams."
1,Not a children's book,"Okay, while the author has good intentions, he's not in touch with children. Four year olds are not ready to deal with missing parents, issues of aging grandparents and subtle references to fairy tales our parents told us. This is a scary, spooky nightmarish story for a 4 year old. So, if you want your child up all night because you scared the dickens out of him/her, read this. If you care about your child, this is not a story for them."
2,Almost perfect,"This saw has every feature you could ever want, except the most stock feature found on a recip. The the sping on the blade holding pin always fails. I've talked to other general contractors and they all agree: ""yea, I owned the Bosch too, until the pin started sticking. Now I own a Makita."" Bottom line - Great saw if they would just change one thing (the thing you use every time you pick up the saw that is!"
3,Not the best DT album,"For the 23 minute title track alone, this album is worth your money. That is one of my favorite Dream Theater songs ever, but I have never been able to really get into the rest of the album. Don't get me wrong, Dream Theater does a great job on the cover songs, and it's really great to listen and see how these musical geniuses intertwine so many songs into one long one. Suprisingly though, I very rarely listen to this album all the way through. I usually find myself taking it out of my CD player after the first track. I think most of my lack of interest comes from not really ever being into the bands they covered. My overall opinion is that anyone into Prog should buy this album for the first track alone, but just don't expect typical Dream Theater throughout the rest of the album. If you want a true Dream Theater masterpiece I would buy 'Images & Words' or 'Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes From A Memory'."
5,my favorite DT,"This falls right were Dream theater was at their peak. Better than Images and Words, because they had not found their feet since the departure of the their former singer. Better than Awake because if is more complex and not all fast distortion. The real stand for everyone is the 23 minute epic Change of Seasons. But the covers and meddles of Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd(two of my other favorite bands) are fantastic. Although the covers sound exactly like the originals, save the vocals of Labri. The drumming is superb and as always Pettruci pulls the solos of beautifully. James Labri's voice is extremely volitile sometimes beautiful and serine, and sometimes screechy of flat and ear peircing. If you don't mind a vocalist that tries new things than by it emidiately, if you don't that's your choice but try it anyway"
3,My First D.T. Album...,"Although this will certaintly not be my last Dream Theater purchase, I was a bit disappointed after their opening 23 minute track.Ironically, in listening to the ""A Change of Seasons"" song, I found myself thinking that they must've been influenced by Pink Floyd and Deep Purple at one point... Well, they did covers of these musicians and more. They weren't badly done re-makes, but they ARE remakes. As far as I'm concerned nothing compares to originals.I've listened to the whole album about 3 times, but I usually just shut the stereo off after track one. If I want to listen to songs by Floyd, Deep Purple, Zepplin and others, I will listen to THEIR VERSION... the original."
3,Ambition peters out quickly when you have average talent.,"Unfortunately, the impression I got from this disc was they went overboard with trying to put out a concept/progressive rock disc. The first track sounds completely contrived for this sake, and I never felt enough emotion in the music. It didn't have that ""grind"" or ""massiveness"" that Images and Words had. Just a lot of pseudo-intellectual attitude. I think this is because each of the musicians are probably above average, but no one stands out as an innovator. The cover tunes are impressive for the range of songs chosen, but again it was a sign that they were simply too tired to write another tedious 23 minute proletariat opus. The rover is great work out music. That's about the only track I listen to anymore. By the way, it's painfully obvious the singer is no Steve Perry."
3,"Good album, Pay close attention","This is a very good album, but the one thing you have to realize is that this is mainly live stuff. Uh - am I the only one that noticed that that is NOT labrie singing on ""Perfect Strangers""?@! I see all these reviews from die hard dream theater fans, and they all fail to mention that Bruce Dickinson sings on that track. Oh well, this album would've been better if they had actually played all of the songs on seperate tracks instead of the medley. But then I guess they wouldn't have been able to fit the title track. Buy the album if you're a collector, otherwise, there are definitely better DT albums to choose from."
3,Eh.... Passable.,"Awake was a stunning album. This isn't. Those 7 words pretty much describe A Change of Seasons for me. New boy Derek Sherinian is on keyboards for this album, and he's not a bad keyboardist. The fact is, there is 1 original song on this whole album. The rest is a bunch of covers, and I find that pretty boring. A Change of Seasons, the 24 minute title track is an interesting piece of musical art. It skips around with a lot of musical ideas, and eventually it ends up as a cohesive piece. The classic rock covers really just get boring after a while. I wouldn't recomment this album as a must have."
4,a brilliant DT album,Change of seasons is one of the best albums from DT which sees the band at it's peak and this album contains a medley of songs by led zeppelin and deep purple.recommended.
4,"Mostly covers, but really good","This is a really good album. It's mostly covers from bands like Kansas, Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, Journey, and Queen. Most covers don't do it for me, but Dream Theater has it covered. Pardon the pun. This isn't one of my favorite Dream Theater records, but it's great. Even their weaker albums are better than most bands best albums. If you haven't heard this record yet, it's a great one to own and enjoy for years to come."
1,Don't expect to boot up from either Firewire Interface,"I got this enclosure for a Hitachi 1 TB disk which has 3 partitions, one of which is a SuperDuper clone. Connected via Firewire 800 and it was recognized fine by my iMac. I could access anything on the drive with no problems. Went to boot up from the drive and it wasn't recognized. Tried FW 400 and on 2 different machines with same results. When I hooked up via USB I could boot from it, but that's way too slow.Contacted Macally and the first question they asked was what power supply I was using, which is the 12v-3A supplied with the unit. Then he told me to contact their warranty department.Needing the drive and not wanting to wait, I had Amazon ship a replacement, but unfortunately, the same problem. Am returning the second one and will get something else.If you're happy using USB, the unit is fine, but why pay for FW, when you don't get the full use of it?Very disappointed."
3,No large drive support,"If you are looking for an enclosure with multiple interfaces, nice form factor, and ease of installation, then this drive is for you. Just don't expected it to have enough power to drive anything in the terabyte range. Other than that, this product looks nice and functions well."
5,Wonderful enclosure!,"This is the best external hard drive enclosure I have ever bought, and that's saying a lot. I haven't had a single issue with it and it's buses work like champs."
2,FireWire limited,"Although this enclosure appears to be of decent quality I quickly returned it after realizing that the ""FireWire"" port is only a FireWire 400 port. The 2009 Mac Mini for instance only has a FireWire 800 port. In order for me to connect this enclosure to my Mac Mini I would either have to use the USB port or purchase a 800 to 400 adapter. On top of this it only includes a USB cable and no FireWire cable. If you do any research on external hard drives you will find out that using USB 2.0 to connect a hard drive results in the drive being at least twice as slow as the same drive connected via FireWire 800. Instead I am looking at a Mercury Elite-AL drive enclosure which is more expensive but has multiple FW800 ports and cables included for all the ports."
3,no ESATA Cable,"what no e-SATA Cable? This is a nice product, but where in the description do they say the eSATA cable is missing? USB / Firewire, sure no problem, but eSATA. Oops, I guess we forgot the cable.Thanks, now I have a useless box until I pay to get a single cable expedited."
5,Pleased!,"So I set this up for another person that had an enclosure fail from another company. I took their old drive from their enclosure and moved it to this one. I had no trouble with installation and I had no trouble seeing the drive through Linux, Mac, or Windows.It is a little slow to be recognized over either usb or fire-wire but I attribute that to the age of the computers he is using it on. With my Linux laptop or desktop there were no issues at all and speed was good.We'll see how it holds up.Still running strong a year later!!"
1,Completely useless or DOA,"I just received mine, expected it to house a WD 2TB drive, but nothing worked.I tried USB and all FireWire ports, nothing works, nothing is detected in Windows.Before I purchased the drive I compared prices online, and on NewEgg's page of the product only mentions that 3TB support would require a firmware update which I can find nowhere on Macally's website.Anyway, I am returning the product immediately."
1,crashed my server more than 5 time until I disconnected for ever.,crashed my server more than 5 time until I disconnected for ever. I tried using the usb interface and the same problem.
5,Used with WD 2 TB Drive,"I read reviews here stating that this enclosure will not power drives greater than 1 TB. I am using this enclosure with a WD 2 TB drive and it has worked well, having stayed powered through a 5 hour Time Machine back up of my Macbook Pro. The enclosure itself is well made and well put together. It was very easy to install and arrived in excellent conditions. The enclosure is at most warm to the touch after hours of operation."
2,Chronic oversleeper,"Looks good, works well... until it goes to sleep, and then it will refuse to wake up. It locks up the entire computer (Mac Mini) until I manually power off/power on the drive unit. This happens every day and makes the drive virtually unusable. I tried adjusting the power saving feature to both extremes to no effect. The discussion boards explain the power supply as the problem, particularly when powering the larger (1 TB or greater) drives and that is indeed what I'm using. Hopefully tech support will send me a higher capacity power supply but even if they do, this type of problem should never have been an issue to begin with.Update: Macally sent me an upgraded power supply. The problem has lessened, but still happens about once every 3 days (instead of everyday). I gave up on it. But I do give Macally some credit for sending the power supply; too bad it was not enough."
5,Enclosure Of The Century,"The Macally Hi-Speed eSATA/FireWire/USB 2.0 Enclosure is the best i have come across presently. Really fast and very quiet in the way it works. Highly efficient and i would recommend it to all of my friends and people who wants to store files such as documents,videos,music and more.The Aluminum silver colour is cool as it allows heat to escape and it is light weight.What ever the connection on your computer this one has it all.Presently i have a SATA 500GB Western Digital hard drive in it. Strictly for audio. Works great.Thanks Macally."
1,"I love the look, but the quality is terrible.","I've had to return two because they will not mount. The drive inside is fine, eSATA, USB, and FireWire connections are read by my 2008 MBP just fine, but this enclosure has some serious hardware issues."
1,Not Worth It!,"Sparks when you plug the ac adapter into the case, doesn't fully support large drives, and while plugged in prevented my other usb devices from functioning. Its junk! Just used a paper weight now."
4,external SATA drive enclosure MacAlly,"I received one eSATA cable with my first purchase.No eSATA cable with this recent order order = inflation, step by step cheapening of product.the enclosure works well."
2,Stopped working after a year or so,"I bought this from Amazon and it worked fine at the beginning. After a year or so, it stopped working. The hard drive still works fine because I can use it either connecting directly to a desktop or use another enclosure."
4,Works and looks great!,"I had a spare 1TB HD available so I decided to purchase this case for it. I was particularly interested in the eSATA and Firewire ports. It looks great, but does allow some noise from the hard drive to be heard. They should have used rubber noise dampening on the HD."
1,did not work!,"Before ordering this enclosure, I already owned the same enclosure, in the USB 2.0 version. The USB enclosure I have had for 9 months has worked beautifully for the 3.5 hard drive I removed from my iMac intel Core2Duo and replaced with an SSD. However, THIS firewire version did not work properly. It would disconnect, spontaneously, and on its own, while connected by firewire. When i tried connecting it with the USB 2.0 cable that came with it, the computer did not see it at all. I tried both the firewire connection and the USB connection on all 3 of our computers - a new Macbook Pro and a new macmini running the latest v of Lion, and also a 2006 iMac intel Core2Duo running snow leopard. The enclosure performed the same on all 3 computers. I am going to try a replacement b/c I think this ONE must be faulty."
1,I don't know why this is so well rated,"Didn't come with any instructions, had to figure it out myself. It worked alright for a little while, but after only turning it on twice the button broke, and the product is completely unusable. I had to stuff foam inside to keep the HDD from becoming dislodged. Going to return."
2,Review of Macally G-350SUA HD Enclosure,"This enclosure's description said it was a firewire/USB enclosure. I obtained it to use as an external bootable HD backup for my iMac G5. It would not boot but did otherwise function as a backup. Macally Customer Service stated although this was a firewire advertised enclosure, it wasn't bootable. (I have another firewire enclosure that does boot on this computer.)"
5,Great Solution,"I replaced an older Time Capsule with a new one but didn't want to get rid of a perfectly good 500 GB 7200 RPM Sata drive. I picked this enclosure up and dropped the drive in. It's a nicely designed piece, maybe not quite as small as some, but still reasonably small. Looks great and cohesive with a Mac environment and promptly did great work for me on a project I was editing. Really couldn't have asked for more so, thus far, nothing but a big thumbs up."
4,Macally G-S350SUA eSATA HD Enclosure,"A well designed and well manufactured enclosure at a great price. The drive fit perfectly and was very easy to install. Open the cover at one end (two screws), slide out the drive tray. Lightly push the drive into the integral connectors at the end of the tray. A couple of (included) screws to secure the drive to the tray, slide the tray back into housing and reinstall the end cover with those same two screws. No sweat. I plugged in the included Firewire (IEEE1394a) cable, and the little power brick, hit the power button and it showed up immediately on the desktop of my Mac.The 2 foot(?) Firewire cable was fine for my setup, but you may need to buy a longer cable to suit your circumstances.So far, I'm a happy camper."
4,Solid!!!,"Pros : choices of ports, price vs quality built, easy to installCons : too bright LED, need to reduce the vibration from the device itself."
1,Not working with larger drives,"More than 1 TB drives do not get enough power, 2 TB does not work at all. Specs claim it should work with all 3.5 drives. False advertising."
1,This enclosure is Junk,"I bought two of these and installed a 2TB drive in each one. I use them for Time Machine backups on a 2010 Mac Pro running OS X Lion.I was getting a complete system lock-up with spinning beach ball about once a week. I finally figured out today that it is these junk drive enclosures. Apparently it fails to spin up and the OS locks up while it tries to access the drive.Worst enclosure ever. Better go buy a OWC enclosure, which is a little more expensive, but they are reliable."
3,This thing has been great.,"I've had this thing for months now. It's been awesome. Plug and play, speedy, reliable. Never had a problem.However, I took it apart one day after it was plugged in and running for a couple hours to take the hard drive out (My brand new 2TB HDD.) It nearly burnt my fingers! I've never felt a hard drive get so hot, and I've taken computers apart and repaired them for years.I'm going to find a way to modify a fan onto this thing before I plug any other hard drive into it. Should be easy and inexpensive. I'm honestly surprised it didn't fry mine. The fact that it's getting 5-star ratings is kind of scary, considering this heat issue!I use the firewire interface with Windows, Slackware Linux, and occasionally on my old PPC Mac Mini. Never had a problem."
1,Pretty piece of junk,I owned this unit for 14 months before Firewire interface died. USB followed suit 1 month later. Luckily the hard drive is OK. I won't ever own another Macally product again.
2,Failure rate,"I bought two of these. One drive is 1TB, the other is 1.5TB. They both worked fine for about 9 months. Just recently the 1TB drive would not mount. I went through the usual diagnostic procedures for the drive before I considered the enclosure. Since I had two of them I swapped the drives in the enclosures, and sure enough, it was the enclosure.Pros: Cheap, and they look niceCons: Looking at other reviews here, and now with my own experience, I would say they are prone to failure at a rate that isn't acceptable."
2,Warning!,"This book had some good points but not enough to improve its rating. The plot is almost non-existant. When Lucy finds out she's been tricked, she has sex with both brothers knowing that Jake is pretending to be Matt. That was very unrealistic. They also made no real plans for the future. They never discussed having children, which would become important at some point. I really thought this book would be good, but I ended up disappointed."
2,"Interesting, but not very well written. Dialog was slow.",The plot was interesting but the dialog was slow and choppy. Not very realistic. Hard to get through.
5,"I REALLY LIKE "" I CAN GO DEEP ""!","Yes, it is better than the first! Silk seemed to mature and their delivery is more relaxed. The song I CAN GO DEEP is bold and Lil G's vocal lead just oozes with soulfulness. Brilliantlly written too. There are other gems too and I like the fact that they were not trying to duplicate the same formula as their debut which is the mistake many artists make. Even better than the debut in my opinion - way better!"
4,tool box dress up,nice item a bit pricy but I like the way it orgaize drawere I bought two sets. I would buy again.
4,Imagine 2008,"This is by far one of the best production that AVB made since the 2006 & 2007 video. As usual he started out slow, then the speed pickup. I enjoy this DVD along with Tiesto Elements of Life."
5,Armin Van Buuren Imagine,"This is the next best thing than seeing him live.... the music selection is great the performances were really good I especially enjoyed communication part 3 and also chris jones ""going wrong"" if you enjoy trance and dance this is a must it completely takes you out of your element !!! however as some of the other reviews mentioned that sharon del adel in and out of love was not on the dvd and I think its because during the performance when she was being presented the mc called her susan not once but twice and she was in the pictures on the 2nd dvd but did not perform on the main event dvd its sad because thats his most popular song but overall the entire show is amazing and makes you wish you could go join the crowd !!!!!! GO ARMIN YOU ARE THE BEST AT WHAT YOU DO!!!!!!"
4,OK but the MC will drive you insane,"Very nice mixes and song selection. Energetic and uplifting, no doubt. A few main reasons I am giving this 4 stars: 1) The insanely annoying MC. I cannot believe Armin allowed this guy on stage. Quite a ""vocabulary"" the guy has... ""shut your eyes"", ""imagine"", ""make some noise"". Pretty pathetic. 2) The ""live"" performances are not live at all. The only one who actually sings can't sing at all. 3) Where is ""In And Out of Love""???"
4,Fun Series,"I remembered reading these books as a teen and really enjoying them, so I bought the series to read them again. It is just fun, light reading that brings me back to when I was a kid. I think the writing is well done and I enjoy the characters. They seem natural and real without being over dramatic. I would recommend this for teens that want to read a fun series that is light hearted."
2,Disappointed,Thought this was a video using just resistance bands - it is not. This is not the product I thought it was.
2,"""B"" Movies I love them","Another addition to my collection. This one is not as bad as many I own. Somewhere between the screen play, and the direction, and the actors the story loses about everything. Absolutely guaranteed to put you to sleep before you know it."
3,After all these years,"After all these years, people are still buying this movie! Somebody is making money on my film that I produced over 10 years ago. It's amazing that I have not received a penny for all the effort that was put into this project. I was only 25 years old when this was produced. It was my first and last project at this scale. Now I work for RE/MAX International in Denver, Colorado and produce and edit motivational videos for our associates, a very rewarding job. If anyone can help me with making good on this project I would appreciate it."
5,"Lively, bouyant boogie woogie","I first became acquainted with Silvan Zingg's work from a download of Pine Top's Boogie, complete with 2 fantastic dancers. This video is super upbeat and chases away the blues. Zingg's musicianship is delightful and infectious in its joyousness. He's a former prodigy and obviously loves the genre of boogie and blues. He captures all of the verve of this style. You can't help smiling when you listen!"
1,A total disappointment!,"My 4-year-old son just LOVES anything Titan, so he was really excited to get this toy. We both thought that the toy would lauch from his wrist with a spinning boomerang action. Unfortunately, all it does is spin on his wrist (limply) and make a really obnoxious noise. He played with it for a day before burying it in his toybox."
2,Disappointing and boring,I bought this for my 3 year old son who LOVES Teen Titans and I thought it was supposed to launch off his wrist or something but all it does is spin for like 3 seconds and thats it. He gets very upset because he thinks it is supposed to launch. Not worth it!
4,no roll paper,"The Sharp Calculator works great. BUT I had to laugh when I saw the roll of paper that came with the unit. It was like a left over roll. It had about 2 feet of paper. You would think when you purchase a new machine that it would come with a FULL ROLL of paper.The Sharp company must be hard up for money to only give you 2 feet of paper. Retail price for a 150 foot roll is 37 cents (Office Depo) Using the retail price, Sharp saved about 1/2 a penny per machine. Here is a thought, If Sharp would raise the cost of thier machine one penny, giving you a full roll, Sharp would make an extra 1/2 cent per machine instead of lossing 1/2 cent. That would make better P/R to the customers like me.Please don't get me wrong, the Sharp Calculator works great and was a good price plus no tax and free shipping. If I needed another machine, I would purchase one. Bob"
4,Practical machine,"Good overall, no downside, older 1197 machines are more sturdily built and printed a fraction faster, but this machine is still good for everyday office use."
2,Deceased,"This unit is dead after 18 months in service. I have come to expect a longer life span from a calculator. This unit was not heavily used (e.g. accounting), rarely used with the printout, and protected by a true online UPS system. Very disappointing, but I will continue to buy Sharp.Fluke, or issue with this model???"
4,very good,Great so far. It does what I want it to do. No complaints. Seven more words required. I don't have seven more words.
1,"The name; but, not the quality","Probably the worst printing calculator I've ever owned; and, there have been many. Unit is beset with both ribbon and paper-feed problems. Print capability completely went down shortly after the product warranty expired. Now useful only for visual display--something one could obtain from a smart phone. Use some judgment, if you're considering purchasing this."
2,Military stuff interesting enough - characters make you cringe,"I sort of knew what I was getting into with Ringo, having read a few of his books. However, while he seems to do pretty well when he cooperates with another writer, when he's working on his own, the characters he creates tend to be painfully thin - and in the case of this book, even ridiculously cringeworthy. Totally put me off from reading the rest of the series."
2,Not so much,"A chavinistic tale (women love their rapists??) with a distinct political slant. The battle scenes are decent but the characters are two-dimensional, at best. Not one I'll ever re-read."
2,A Step Down,"After the return to form with the personal ""I'm Alive"" this release feels like a disappointment. Best tracks are the rocking title cut and the Barracades Of Heaven. But overall not much else to recommend it."
3,Give it time and it will speak to you.,"I write as a fan of Browne's music, but I did not give this album much attention. I loved ""I'm Alive"" and did not hear much in this that was equal to it. I have since listened to it with greater interest and find much more than on my first hearing. I do not feel it is as good as ""I'm Alive,"" but it is clearly worth buying. Browne knows what he is doing and there is much in ""Looking East"" which can stand along side other Browne music on a mix!"
2,Half an album of good material,"I'm a huge Jackson fan but won't hide the fact that I believe his best albums are well in the past. This album starts out with promise - the first three cuts are solid and recall shades of many of his classics. Unfortunately, the album deteriorates quickly, almost as if the rest is filler to get to the requisite ten songs. I'm the Cat? Not only is the song annoying, but I can't believe the same guy that wrote such classics as Late for the Sky etc. penned such lyrics. You're far better off discovering his old material, which is incredible, than listening to this drivel."
3,Average Browne Release,"This mid 90's era album came at a time when Browne's years as a platinum selling commercial artist were behind him. ""Looking East"" would prove to be his last studio album of new material for more than a decade. Overall this is a good, but not great Jackson Browne album. The CD starts out strong with the politically tinged title track and a nostalgic look back at youth in ""The Barricades Of Heaven"". The third track ""Some Bridges"" is also good. The rest of the album slides a bit with good to average Browne songwriting. The album closes with a reggae number ""It Is One"" which does not quite work to my ears. This is not a must own Browne album, but there is enough good stuff here to make it worth owning for fans of the man."
4,For Every Fan,"While ""Looking East"" is also available as a domestic release, the real attraction of this import version is the hidden bonus track, ""World In Motion,"" in a stunning gospel take which bears the rare distinction of besting both Browne's original, and later effort on Pops Staples' ""Peace In The Neighborhood."" Although expensive for a single disc, fans will find this CD to be a worthwhile purchase."
4,Barricades of Heaven bootstraps this otherwise so so cd.,"Barricades is singularly the best song of Jackson's in over ten years. Some Bridges has flashes of old time JB brilliance. JB needs to stay smart and bring back David Linley permanantly. After those two songs the album is close to over. If Barricades had been intoduced by JB in the 70s or early 80s it would have had the type of airway playing time it deserves. When compared to the album's other songs, this ode to JB's youth makes nearly all of the rest of the album only barely palatable-but you choke it down to get to this very tasty morsel!"
2,Poor read of interesting subject,"This was a book I made myself read because I found the character Mr. Challen was writing about so facinating. Unfortunately, the writing did not match the long and prolific life of Dutch Leonard. This was more like a high school term paper than a biography and did a disservice to the subject matter. The author kept mentioning his favorite books (which were most of them) but gave no real insight as to his subject's motivations. All in all, a real disappointment."
5,The BEST one made,"To me, this is his best CD where Gerald is singing with his father. They sound almost alike. Everytime I hear them singing ""Wind Beneath My Wings"" together, I always cry. Theirs was a special father and son relationship."
2,Pretty average,considering the talents of Both Eddie Levert&Gerald Levert this set is very middle of the road.the vocals are good but the music is for the most part run of the mill.
1,"Biased and premised on a comet - not academic, tabloid like.","The book is based on the premise that Century 10, Quatrain 72 - ""King of Terror"" is a comet. The parsing of words is rammed down your throat, this interpretation cannot be wrong! The cover of the book has a badge that says ""Who will survive?"", the cover shows a clock with a planet earth background and a header that says ""A COMET IS HURTLING TOWARD EARTH...""Nostradamus was vauge in his prophecies, but Mr. Paulus does not think that his ""interpretations can be."" The whole book is based on this one most likely incorrect or unlikely scenario.I got John Houge's The Complete Prophecies. The author gives guidlines for interpretations and challanges the reader to examine the interpretations, for that is all these are. The Quatrains are interesting and facinating.John Hauge's book let's you explore these possibilities without telling you what to believe.Don't buy the Paulus book, you'll be diasappointed."
4,"Well researched, poorly interpreted, should read",The eclipse has happened but the great king of terror is a person not a comet. the comet is a symbol to nostradamus of destruction. comets pass over when bad things are about to happen. during the eclipse a child waas born with an eclipse shaped birthmark on the back of its head. this is the great king of terror who will be worse than the bibles first beast(there were two) these of course are my own interpretations based on my own research but i have limited space to write here. read the book but dont worry so much as to build a bomb shelter. things happen but for a reason. if you are meant to survive you will. if not then prepare your soul.
1,What can I say.....,"Today is the 19th of July 2000. Last review I saw was from September 1999. Anything happened to you? A comet fell on your heads and you all died? I hope this will give you a lesson that there are NO prophets after the Son of God who came to save our lives; and you have nothing better to read and you are wasting your time with someone called Nostradamus, and not only that, but you also believe those B.S. and worry about it. For God sake...get serious!There are much more important things to worry about in life and the first should be how to save your soul and be prepared when God calls you.I apologize if I offended anyone with my review; this is what I needed to say after reading your reviews."
1,S!SG by who?!? when?!? where?!? I wish.,"Um....Everytime I try and start the game it just displays the following message:""Sorry, your box is empty."""
4,The title song is worth the purchase.,"This group is now one of the more forgotten bands of the 70's. This album has really been put aside. That is a shame, because the title track is one of the best songs they ever recorded. Plus, ""Slippin Into Darkness"" is on this album and it is a fine song also. They really didn't get funky until later, but this album should not be passed on."
1,This book must be preparation for some other GRE,"This book is an OK study guide, for some one who just wants to brush up on a litte math and english. It, however, does very little to prepare you for the actual exam. The exam was a total suprise and very little in this book, especially in the math sections, was helpfull preparation. The computer adaptive disk could not be more different from the actual exam. Their computer program even had a calculator built in. Anyone who has taken the exam knows that those things are not allowed in the exam room. I was totally disapointed. I bought this book so that I could get an idea what the exam would be like but it turns out that I would have been better off with a dictionary and a pre-cal book. Don't waste your money."
5,"Best release of 2003, Absolutley Essential!","WOW! This is the finest release of 2003. Amazing performances, beautifully recorded to CD and DVD. The Deepest End is a fitting tribute to Woody and essential for anyone who loves great music. The 2 CDs are extraordinary, add the DVD and this is an amazing value. Warren and Matt are on fire and the arrangements especially ""Beautifully Broken"" are incredible. WOW!"
5,Found several Songs I relate to -- especiall LOVE CAN BUILD A BRIDGE and GUARDIAN ANGEL,"Great voices and meaningful songs -- all in one CD ! Beautiful and timeless harmony, not just for the COUNTRY FAN !"
2,A disappointing effort,"I enjoy Tracy Chapman, but I don't think this is a good album. The songs are not very strong, and even those that are go on far too long. Nothing approaches her simple folk greatness of Fast Car."
3,Boring album,"I really liked Chapman's first album, but I thought ""New Beginning"" was rather dull, monotonous and depressing. The songs are all rather slow and repetitive, with few changes in tempo. I like Tracy Chapman, but with this album, I was hoping for something a little more exciting."
5,So Smooth,"It's a shame that Tracy Chapman doesn't do more recordings, but that is probably because she writes her own material and doesn't want to sound like everyone else. She definitely doesn't and that's an excellent thing! Among the 3 ""favorites"" that I have on this CD is the mellow ""Smoke and Ashes,"" the bluesy ""Give me Just one Reason,"" and ""I'm Ready."" This is good listening and would be comparable to a fine aged wine. Her Rich voice dominates, with mellow undertones. Class. Pure and Simple."
4,great music and lyrics,"After some depressing CD's, Tracy has come out with an inspiring CD, well worth listening to. Her voice is interesting as usual, but this time her lyrics grab you also."
4,"Tracy is ""Heaven Here on Earth""","Even though this CD was released in 1995, ""New Beginning"" is still fresh. It is one of my favorite CD's to unwind with at the end of a hurried day.When I first heard ""Gimme One Reason"" getting air play, I immediately bought her masterpiece. And have grown to love each song for their rhythms and emotional messsages. ""The Promise"" rings so true......and I will gladly wait for another heavenly Chapman release as good as this one is.Thanks--CDS"
3,Middling Success,"New Beginning is not the most apt title for this endeavor from Tracy Chapman. It implies freshness and change, when in fact the tracks are very like each other, and lyrics can be repetitive.That said, it is still worth an occasional listen. The radio-released ""Give Me One Reason"" will have you dancing, and is the only song of its bluesy beat. ""At This Point In My Life"" describes someone eager to, but afraid of taking a new step. The sorrowful ""Remember the Tinman,"" ""The Rape of the World,"" and ""Cold Feet"" all tell of things lost and crimes committed. The final track, ""I'm Ready,"" washes the rest of the collection's pains away and faces bravely forward. If you're in the right pensive mood, New Beginning will make you feel comforted and understood. If not, you'll want a more vigorous wake-up call."
4,Still another joy!,"I need to say that this is one of the nicer CDs I have had the joy of hearing. I really do love Tracy Chapman's style of writing and passion for singing found in many of her works; however do not expect to find all of that throughout this album. Here, she has softened up quite a bit from her first couple albums and in some ways it has really has not changed her sound. Some songs like ""New Beginning"" and ""Give Me One Reason"" have the blues beat that make them wonderful to listen to. One of my favorite songs on this somewhat-diluted album has to be ""Rape of the World"" because at this point it is just so true, and it makes me feel some guilt and unhappiness, which is Chapman's form. Another one I remember is ""Remember the Tinman"", and it has been awhile I still remember that song being like some of the others here. All of the songs will bring up some form of feeling, as found in all of Chapman's CDs, which never seem to change with time or fame, unlike with many other artists."
3,"Come Back, Tracy Chapman","On Tracy's first 2 albums I loved (and I guess everyone else did, too) her raw, intimate, highly personal delivery. The rough quality of her voice was perfect for the real, gutsy messages in the songs. These days it seems that (1) the instrumentation is overwhelming and obliterates that illusion of ""I'm right here with you,"" and maybe (2) her singing has become (oh, rats!) kinda civilized. Is this just my imagination, people?"
5,"Amazing music, great voice",This is an excellent CD. Almost all songs are simply amazing. The more you listen the more you like them. Will give you lot of peace of mind and inspirationSatya
5,I Tell It Like It Is,"Like She said Heaven's Here On Earth. On this album Tracy Has made a new beginning, whit her deep and soulful voice and her meaningful lyrics is this whitout doubt her best to date. Give me one reason not to like this album and not to tell all you other that this CD is a must have, At this point in my life I am very bored by the radio music, so I turn on Tracy's music and all she leaves behind is smoke and ashes. Sorry I have to end her I'm going to buy the music video "" Telling Stories """
5,Tracy at Her Best,"As a long time follower of Tracy Chapman, I have all her music, but I have to say that New Beginnings is my favorite. Especially Cold Feet, At This Point in My Life and The Promise. The passion expressed through the lyrics, and coming from such a distinctive voice moves me to tears at times. Her sound is unique and bold and not comparable to any other contemporary artist that I am aware of. I hope she continues recording music for a long time to come and I will continue to watch and buy anything that she releases."
5,A wonderful CD,This is one of my favorite cds by this singer. I love her voice and the cd is a wonderful addition to any collection.
4,A pleasant surprise,"I heard this CD at a friend's house and had to add it to my collection. I was never really a fan of Tracy's work, but I was feeling this compilation of blues and folk tunes. The lyrics are poignant and are well matched with the arrangements. ""Give Me One Reason"" is a standout as are the title track, ""The Promise"" and ""I'm Ready. "" I like the acoustics, guitar and strings on this CD. This CD made me a fan."
5,This one has depth!,"This artist takes her music seriously! It isn't the fluff we hear so often. Take this one home, truly listen to it and love it. It's worth it!"
5,A very emotional and moving recording,"This is my new favorite Tracy Chapman CD. She continues perfecting her storytelling through beautiful moving music. She is extremely talented. She raises personal and environmental issues on this CD. Whenever I share this music with guests in my home, they always ask what CD I'm playing and seem quietly surprised."
5,Beautiful,"There are very few songs that can have such and impact on me. In fact there really aren't any. I found after hearing this cd once that it was so beautiful and emotional. ""The Promise"" my favorite song is one of the only songs in the world that can make me cry everytime I listen to it. I find this cd to be great and I recommend it to anyone and everyone."
2,"Repetition, repetition, repetition","Just as in my title, Tracy's songs repeat the same word or phrase over and over again, ad infinitum. After two or three songs like this, the album becomes incredibly boring. If she avoided this technique, her songs would be fine. I bought the album for one song ""Give Me One Reason"". I do like that song, but I wish I had saved some money and just purchased that one."
2,Only one reason to buy this album,"""The promise"" is an absolutely fantastic song and my only reason for buying this album. Heard it first on Aer-Lingus trans atlantic in-flight entertainment. Simply had to have this song. Lot of money for one song but worth it. I listened to all the other songs to be fair and none made the cut to go on my i-pod. I suppose this is why people download..."
3,pretty good,"Tracy ChapMan is very talented.she could blow away Sherryl Crow,Sarah Mclaughlin,Natelie Merchent, and others.she has feeling in her music.i would Love to see her work with someone like MESHALLNEDEOCELLO.put Grooves behind Tracy and watch out.i liked Give me the reason&a couple of others but overall she needs to do something different.she has the talent."
1,New Beginning By Tracy Chapman,It is not the Tracy Chapman you will be expecting to hear. This album is a complete disaster. I wish I had not bought it.
2,"Fine riding info, but bad taste","This book has fine details on many of Moab's great rides. Throughout much of this guide, however, I got the feel that this author has a chip on his shoulder. He seems to be getting all his revenge and mean spirits out through this guide book. Some of it is actually comical, but most of it just rude. One example (and I'm paraphrasing): riding the White Rim in 4-5 days is ""boring"". Note to author: some of us actually use our mtn bikes to take us to beautiful, tranquil areas. It's not always about how much air we get or how many miles logged. Anyone who would call 5 days in Canyonlands with a mtn bike ""boring"" is lacking some serious taste for life.Instead, buy the Falcon pocket guide by Crowell. It's got great info, is small enough for your pack, and without the rude gossip."
2,Mountain Biking Moab,"The author provides excellent information, maps and important details that will help make your Moab experience much less frightening. The book will also familiarize you with the terrain/trails before you get there. However, Mr. Bridgers still manages to ruin it by being rude, crude and derogatory throughout the book. The text is full of swearing and blasphemy, crude descriptions of which body parts rock formations resemble, and put-downs aimed at Mormons; he promotes lies and almost never portrays Latter-day Saints in a good light. All of the information that you need from this book can be obtained in the Mountain Bike Moab Pocket Guide, and that book will fit into your Camelbak. Save your money, and don't buy this book."
1,Don't bother! Crass and unprofessional.,"Unfortunately, the author degrades himself and his readers throughout this book. Just take a look at how many are up for resale on the used list and that's all you need to know."
1,Do not waste your money,"This book is vulgar and demeaning. I think the author disgraces himself and gives a poor impression of Moab and the quality of people in that area. Furthermore, he hates the 4th of July, makes crass comments and seems to despise good taste. This book ended up where it belongs, in the trash. The only redeeming part of this book is the author's safety warnings and fair trail descriptions. However, it would be better to maintain your self respect by getting a more uplifting guide book since there are some good ones out there with excellent trail descriptions and advice."
2,Lee Bridger's Chip on the Shoulder,"There are a lot of rides described in this book however, this guy has a chip on his shoulder! He can't say much good about anyone except himself. As others have said - there are other good guide books with good trail information and not all the drivel!"
1,Be careful about buying this brand,I just bought these at my local health food store and the second main ingredient is now NOT safflower or sunflower oil but canola oil. ALL canola oil is GMO.
4,"hey, chill!","Hey, Eggplant, first of all let's hear you write down a few songs, ok? Why do people base their maturity level on how many people they can piss off? I read the book, it is good. I know that many people might not like it because GC has fulfilled their goals and they haven't but instead of hating GC for it; get a life, use their example and stop acting like middle school asses! Punk or not punk, GC have given us a lot of proof that if we want to acheive something, we can! So, again, chill!"
3,- -,"....No one's better than no one... Good Charlotte is not better than the haters, and vice versa. Sarah, you need to chill.... Basically, don't buy this book; because everything in this book you already know. Buy this book if you saw them on TRL and think they are so cool and the best band ever after you heard two of their songs or...saw the twins and thought they were so hot, then this book is yours..read..learn."
3,Pretty good,"My friend got this book and didn't want to write a review, so I am doing it for her. She really liked the book because she didn't know a lot about the twins. But I really wanted to learn more about Paul, Billy, and Chris. Because.... Well, the twins are everywhere and the other guys don't get a lot of the spot light. So, if you just want to know more about the twins, then I suggest you try to get it. If you want to know more about the band, I think you should buy it just for the pictures. :)"
3,imbecile reviewers,"No I haven't read the book, my friend has and said it was okay. The guy who worte the his own story of GC as a review was JOKING! Yeah, he may think GC sucks, but he didn't actually mean that what he wrote happened. Idiots you are.But back to the review, the pictures were good, and from what else i saw it seemed like an okay book, but it seemed most of the info they would answer if you asked them, or HAVE answered in interviews."
3,Nothing New,"it was a good book except if u have been a true fan, a fan from the start then all the info given is jus thing u already know. i suppose it good if u no absolutly nothing about GC but to real GC fans this book is kinda useless."
1,The story of good charlotte,I am good charlottes biggest fan although alot of people said i would already no all the stuff written in the book i got it anyway. The whole book is based on the madden twins and i ask why? i no they started the band but without billy and paul and alternitive drummers chris and arron they would still be playing in thier garage. So i give this book 1 out of 5 stars because the book is called the story of good charlotte not the story of the madden twins.
3,"i really cant rate, it was for my daughter.",this was for my daughter so I really cant say anything about it. All though she has not complained .
3,um sure why not,"i'm only through half the book. it does feature benji and joel pretty much. the only thing ive learned that i didnt know already is that billy worked at mcdonalds when he was 14. and for all the haters, its just music.-rock is dead long live paper and scissors"
4,A start,I've seen a few of these. If your a Spenser fan you'll enjoy them. Also wanted to add my voice to those calling for the actual TV series to be released on DVD. That will be worth owning.
4,Urich at his best,"Robert Urich may not have been the best actor you have ever seen, but he was always a solid one, and this is no exception. A very entertaining series, and one I will happily watch again over time."
1,SPENSER FOR HIRE - THE MOVIE COLLECTION,"As a Bostonian transplanted to DC and a Spenser fan I was looking for some nostalgia. These movies are awful. Spenser driving a Ford Probe, are you nuts. The only recognizable characters from the series are Spenser and Hawk. The shrink, the cops all different. A lot of it didn't even seem to have been filmed in Boston (perhaps Toronto). Plots were predictable, dialogue stilted, acting was wooden. I wouldn't pay $1 for these movies. Need to get the old series on DVD."
2,Spencer for Hire movies,"The movies were pretty good. These DVDs appeared to offer closed captioning but I could not get that feature ""on."" Therefore, the person I bought them for could not enjoy them."
5,Spenser Review,"I am a big fan of the T.V. show and I was pleasantly surprise to find out about the collection. I also, like the role Avery Brooks plays as ""Hawk"". It's a shame that there are only a few episodes."
4,dpiggee,"I am a big fan of the ""Spenser for Hire"" television series, and I was brokenhearted when the series was cancelled. I remember when the first Spenser movie came out, I was overjoyed, but I thought that the movies had a few too many dead spots, as if these stories were written for the one hour alotted for the television series, and not for a full length film. I did enjoy seeing Robert Urich, and it is hard to believe that I won't see him again in a new Spenser movie. As for Avery Brooks, what can I say, he was born to play ""Hawk"". I do recommend the movie collection because it is a great chance for all of us to get a taste of good television. We may never see it this good again. Unless of course, the Spenser series is released on video. I rate this collection with 4 stars, not five, because of the slower pace, but the dialogue was first rate, as well as the chemistry between Urich and Brooks. Enjoy!!"
2,"Spenser, Spenser Where are you?","The four movies in this collection are based upon books written by Robert Parker. However, the movies are far from quality of the books which provide their foundation and the production values for the movies are rather limited and seem to take advantage of convenient settings. A major missing element is the humor one expects from Spenser and the plots while close to the book are rather predictable.The original TV series was much better."
3,What to say that hasn't already been said,"""Spenser: For Hire"" these four Lifetime telefilms are not (consider your purchase of this collection a vote for the release of the original series), but they sure are fun on a Sunday afternoon when I'm in between Parker novels.Despite the author's feelings to the contrary, Urich as our hero has been dead-on in my mind's eye. Yes, Avery Brooks as Hawk was simply inspired. Their chemistry remaining intact in this collection of movies is what preserves their watchability.A hidden treat inside each DVD case is four short Spenser essays - each detailing the production of the films, as well as some background on the original series and opinion from Parker about the television Spenser. Each treatise is well-written and enjoyable.So along with the collection of books I've amassed, I look forward to the day I can share my love of Hawk, Susan and the cocky, cool PI from Boston with my son - whom we named ""Spenser."""
5,Spenser Movie Review,"These are great movies for those of us who enjoyed reading all of Robert Parker's Spenser books. The movies were great since it has been so long since the Spenser for Hire series aired on TV. There are slight changes from the original books, but they keep pretty close to original story lines. Would love to see some of the original TV series put on DVD's. It was great to see Robert Urich again. Parker's son is in each one.Jeff from Atlanta"
4,Spenser for Hire - the movie collection,"If you renember the Spenser for Hire television series, you will truly enjoy this colleciton of four full length movies. Spenser and Hawk are great and set the tone for exciting stories. This is a must for suspense and mystery buffs, with some humor thrown in."
3,Four Is Enough,"SPENSER FOR HIRE-Robert Urich as Spenser, a tough macho Boston detective, Avery Brooks, as `Hawk', Spensers deadly sidekick and Spensers love interest Susan Silverman, played by Barbara Stock. Spencer uses the formula detective story of the times, With brawn, a gun and his sidekick he plows through the story. To hold everyone's interest gun battles, car chases, and a tender moment with his girlfriend at dinner or at home. Spenser proves that he doesn't need ""the little gray cells"" to solve a crime. The set has four DVD's of the ""best"". Entertaining, but four is enough."
3,Me Want More!,"I would give this product a 3.75 Star if it was available--maybe a 4 for old time sake! I love the Spenser for Hire series. These were TV movies, I guess. I hadn't seen them before, so that was good. I would like to get the entire TV series on DVD. Personally, I love Hawk. Avery Brooks is awesome. Robert Urich is the ultimate woman's man--so kind and sensitive, but not too..."
1,Spenser for Hire - the Movie Collection,"The movies don't even come close to touching the quality of the TV series. Spenser and Hawk seem like tired caricatures of themselves and Susan doesn't add anything to the mix. In fact, the movies would be better without her. If they ever put the TV series on DVD, I'd love to have it!"
4,Canadian/Irish folkie,Found this lady on the Mary Black mailing list. I think she was Mary's opening act at one point. Ordered her CD from a tiny company in Canada. I found it delightful. She seems to be of Irish origin relocated to Canada. Very nice voice and very nice production. She did a really good job on this CD. I keep looking for more from her.
4,Very weird film,"While Guinea Pig Devils Experiment isn't quite what I thought it would be, I found it interesting nonetheless. I'm a fan of gore films and this one certainly has that. It is a little cheesy in spots, but overall, if one is into these types of films, than I suggest giving it a try. I'm glad that I added it to my collection. I'll likely seek out the other films in the series."
5,Different than I thought,"I envisioned this being smaller than it is. But what was I thinking? It is a twin bed as well as a lounger. The directions are a little sparce but not that difficult to put together. Once together I'm impressed with it's sturdiness. It's for my husband who loves sitting, lounging and laying down watching TV. He usually has two or three of our 5 dachshunds sitting with him, and there's room for him and all 5 of the dogs!"
2,A little disappointed,"I don't think this video was professionally prepared for pregnant women, I don't care if this guy has been certified to teach yoga for pregnant women... I did yoga before getting pregnant and while pregnant, and the downward positions in this video do not make me feel comfortable at all. Also I don't consider other positions should be intended for pregnancy. I even remember the trainer telling one of the ladies in the video who was tumbling that it was OK if she fell, that it was normal (falling when pregnant being OK!!!!, I don't share this opinion)... One of the reviews I read before buying said the trainer was calling the ladies ""sweetie""... I thought this person was exaggerating but it was really annoying!!! I was very excited when I purchased this video as it was focusing on my favorite yoga (power yoga) but was disappointed..."
3,Nice series,"I've been practicing yoga for about ten years and am currently in my second trimester of pregnancy. This video offers a really nice power yoga series for pregnant women. It's both challenging and at the same time relaxing.The video is advertised, however, as not only a prenatal yoga class but also a tool to ""help expectant mothers prepare mentally for pregnancy and birth."" There was very little on this video that I would take away as lessons for birth.One nit-picky comment: throughout the video Marck Blanchard repeatedly calls the pregnant women ""sweetheart"" or ""honey."" When it is his wife, I understand, but for the other two women it just felt wrong. Made the hair on my neck rise just a bit."
4,It seems to help!,"This is as basic as it can be, and I'm not sure it's worth $12.95. But It was recommend to me by a stranger who said it changed her life. She recommended buying a lot of them as they are hard to find in book stores and she said I'd want to give them to friends. So I did! I bought 10 of them and have given them all to friends and family and everyone seems really pleased. I've now read it myself and find that I'm incorporting its information into my daily life. Has it changed my life? No. Has it changed my attitude? Yes."
5,THIS WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE!,"I don't often give five stars, but these little afformations will truly change your life, as they engage the brain to find the answers you need for change. My family life was turned around in two weeks by using these. I think it works by clearing limiting beliefs you have that also affect others in your life. A very small investment for the benefits you will get from them."
3,a pamphlet,"not what i expected. it was a stapled pamphlet with no cover, reminded me of a church hand out. The list of afformationswere good."
4,Great idea,"It is a wonderful idea to ask yourself a positve questions instead of statements, but don't think, that asking a few times will change your life. You have to ask these questions many times a day. I would also add visualizations and other law of attraction games.The only reason I am giving it four stars is because it doesn't explain at all how to use afformations. It says - use it as you would use affirmations, so it asumes, that you already know that. I think that is very important part and shouldn't be left out of the book of that nature."
3,A Unique Book,"This item arrived quickly in very good shape. It has an interesting take onaffirmations, which are transformed into afformations. However, I like theteachings of The Law of Attraction by Michael Losier. The latter also makessense and feels more comfortable practicing. I did not send this book back butgave it to a friend who might want to use its methods."
4,reggae in your jeggae,"Good stuff from the sublime Mr Perry.By no means his best,produced for the international market this lacks the pop suss of his best stuff,but a good entry point for the uninititiated.I take it no-one out there knows what ras clat really means - it's pretty offensive."
1,I do not like this bra at all,"I figured with all the rave reviews I would go ahead and spring for a $68.00 bra (which is more than I usually pay and I am not on a tight budget). This is the most uncomfortable bra I have. I am a 36D and it is constricting, too small, wires hurt, etc. I'll stick with my Olgas, thank you."
1,not what you are expecting,"....all the hits are here, but not how you remember them. Eric Burdon shows us how ""artistic"" he can be, changing the timing, emphasis and arrangements for no good reason. Knowing the original Animals versions, I found these ones painful to listen to and had to return the CD"
1,This is awful.,Eric Burdon sounds like a lounge singer in a lounge band. I kept expecting William Shatner to start singing (performing) back-up at any minute.....
2,Eric Burdon's a burden on this album,Not what I thought it would be. In fact it is nothing like I thought it would be. This rendition by Burdon is not like The Animal's real music. Could really have live without this CD.
1,probably not what you think it is....,"....all the hits are here, but not how you remember them. Eric Burdon shows us how ""artistic"" he can be, changing the timing, emphasis and arrangements for no good reason. Knowing the original Animals versions, I found these ones painful to listen to and had to return the CD"
2,disappointing,"I was very excited waiting for this CD to arrive -- failed to recognize until I heard it that this was Eric Burdon singing the Animals' classics with a new set of musicians. From the overall lack of quality, it appears that remastering the original recordings would've been a better idea. If you have to have this one, please listen to a number of the cuts first."
2,"This is Eric singing for himself, not the usual versions.","The CD is Burton's interpretation of the classic songs. Some are good, some are not. In any event it is not what you would expect from the titles. Listen to the cuts before you buy."
1,"sorry, but I think it's dreadful","Perhaps this CD offers a better experience when used in conjunction with the music book that is also available, but as a stand-alone CD of Chanukah music, it's beyond dull. Judy's voice is thin and tremulous, the musical accompaniment to her voice is practically non-existent. The renditions are slow and lifeless, not music for a joyful celebration, most especially not for a holiday that is so much about children."
1,Extreme disappointment.,"I have seen a small number of Jam Handy films, and I have found them to be (usually) very well made and (usually) interesting.I thought that an interview of the man responsible would itself be interesting, that it would include some talk of his methods andformulas for his work, and may include at least a few clips fromsome of his films.""No such ruck"".The interview is a loooooooong, booooooooring, snoooooozefest with no worthwhile content or informative value whatsoever. There are NO film clips (couldn't there have been some on the dvd, even if they were separate from the interview?) nor any other material of visual interest.I strongly advise everyone to avoid this DVD.I wish I'd never found it, and I wish even morethat I hadn't paid for it."
3,No Standouts,"I like Anthrax, especially John Bush era stuff (We've Come For You All and Sound of White Noise are awesome), but this disc just falls flat. It starts out pretty good with 'Random Acts of Senseless Violence' but...that's about it. I've seen many other commenters on here talk about how all of the songs sound the same/blend together. That's exactly true. Nothing stands out. None of it is awful...it's heavy...but it's bland. Again, I think Anthrax has some really good albums, and I especially like some of their albums with Bush singing, but this one is just okay. For me, it's a must have simply because I have all the Bush era Anthrax (a couple Belladonna era), but unless you are a hardcore Anthrax/John Bush fan, this album is not a must buy."
4,Another good set from Anthrax,"I think there was a period in the 90's where Anthrax ended up in a bit of a rut, as far as the critics may have seen it. The series of recordings with Jon Bush at the mike continued to be strong, with high-powered rhythms and great songs, but with the glut of other bands and a lot of pretenders, some of the stuff got lost.""Stomp 442"" had another slab of great heavy metal rock, with ""Random Acts,"" ""Fueled"" and ""Tester"" among the stellar tracks.You have with Anthrax a band that chooses to continue to pound away with heavy sound, but the songs stretch out from the ludicrous to the dead bloody serious.There is really nothing wrong with this album. I still like it, and it fits in well with others such as ""Sound of White Noise"" and ""Among the Living,"" as well as ""We've Come For You All."""
4,Great album,"The best songs on this album are ""random acts of senseless violence"", ""fueled"", and ""riding shotgun"". There is some weak tracks on this album and is not as humorous as some of the earlier Anthrax albums which is a minus. As for the extra tracks, the cover of Celtic Frost's ""dethroned emperor"" is incredible. Bottom line: if your an Anthrax fan buy this but buy some of their other albums first, like Sound of White Noise or Among the Living."
4,Very Good...but Not Great,"Stomp 442 definitely showed that Anthrax had rediscovered thrash and consequently it packed one HEAVY punch. However, it lacks that certa9n something that makes a good album great. Sure, Random Acts of Senseless Violence, Fueled, Riding Shotgun, and Tester all shred, but overall it's not on the same level as SOWN, POT, and ATL. Anthrax clearly retained the thrash element of Stomp 442 and combined it with Sound of White Noise to produce the killer Volume 8: The Threat is Real. If you liked liked Anthrax back when they were thrashy, definitely pick this one up."
3,Nice follow up to Sound of White Noise!!!!,"This album came out out at the wrong time but is a good album none the less. In 1995 the whole rap/rock thang was in full swing, but Anthrax had already did it in 1991 w/ Public Enemy. Standout tracks on this ablum are Nothing, Fueled, and Bare. Worth a listen fo sure."
5,Underrated Classic,"Anthrax is my favorite band, so my opinion may be biased, but this is an underrated classic, probably because it goes in a much more aggressive direction than SOWN does. ""In a Zone"" and Drop the Ball"" are two of the heaviest songs they have ever done. They alone are worth the price. ""Nothing"" is a melodic song in the vein of ""Only"". ""Bare"" is a nice ballad, but not up there with ""Black Lodge"". This album expands upon the sound they created with ""Persistance of Time"" by mixing churning, crunching riffs with melody lines that are much darker than those found on State of Euphoria."
3,Good Try By A Good Band,"Anthrax is one of my favorite bands, but this album was really missing something. It was missing that cohesiveness that they had on most of their previous stuff.BUT, Still a solid effort by the band"
2,Have they lost the plot?,"Firstly, I must say I love these guys (in a man-to-man sort of way), but this album did nothing for me. I thought Sound of White Noize was a classic, but on Stomp, all the songs sound the same, so I couldn't get into it (nor the follow-up- Vol. 8; sounds like poor man's frash). Maybe they should do a full album of rap-metal crossover?"
2,Not worth tracking down,"Listening to this album reminds me of Pantera's ""Far beyond driven"": While there are no standout weak links, the whole album is similarly monotonous and a disappointing followup. Any individual song isn't too bad (though hardly memorable), but listening to the whole CD makes me lose recognition of which song is playing after 15 minutes or so. Anthrax can blame their record label all they like for the weak sales and image problem, but the band similarly seemed to be putting little effort into this release. The first couple of songs and the end song are fine, but that's the Far beyond Driven problem again. I'd say pretty much any other Anthrax release is better. Even the debut with that first singer, because at least the band had some edge on that showing."
2,Careful now...,"I don't like this stuff. In fact, I hate it when I have to tell my neighbors to turn their music down constantly when they blast it through their stereos, as I can't concentrate when this is blasting. It is so grating to my ears, I would rather listen to a fire alarm.In fact, this is the album that David Merrell used when he did his study on mice and music. For the hard rock, he used this album. The mice had difficulty with it--not only did the mice exposed to this music have more difficulty going through the maze than the other mice, after the study was over the mice turned bitter toward each other and killed themselves!If you like this album, or hard rock music in general, that's fine, but please be careful. This album may be hazardous to your health!"
4,Good Stuff,"This deffinatley isn't thrash metal...not really metal either. Anthrax went with a more alternative sound on this one. I guess I'd say it's inbetween hard rock and metal. Either way, it's pretty good. It's under rated I'd say. A lot of the tracks on here are some of their best such as ""Random Acts Of Senseless Violence"" and ""Nothing"". A few others are so-so though. This CD was pretty experimental but over all I'd say it turned out pretty good."
2,What happened to Anthrax?,They were one of my favorite bands but I can't find any post-Joey material that's any good. This album is all weak and forgettable songs. Gone are the days of riff-driven metal. The vocals are also a disappointment. I guess the Anthrax I knew is dead and gone. How very unfortunate.Not recommended.
5,what a great cd,"I have been a fan of blue scholars after seeing them at bumpershoot 2006 I had to get this album. Its awesome. They have such a positive message to send to people and they tie a lot of seattle in to it as well. They hardly curse I think I heard a bad word twice in all the songs. My favorites are north by northwest, fire for the people, joe metro, and bring em back home. A great way to help out a local seattle duo and get some gret tunes!!!!"
1,based on flawed research and mathematical errors,"Weitzman falsified data and made numerous mathematical errors and faulty data gathering techniques to make her case that women and children suffer much worse financially after divorce than do divorced fathers. Feminist propaganda at its finest, which has been used to hurt many children and fathers."
5,ABSOLUTELY FUN!!,"What a Great CD! Loved every song! Never thought I'd be writing a review on a Country alblum, but this one is just plain FUN! Great songs! Great sound! Bucky Covington has done himself proud! With a twang of country and the bone soul of rock....this alblum works for me! This boy was born to sing Country!"
5,A BRILLIANT START TO A LONG CAREER,"Bucky Covington's debut CD, Bucky Covington, is an awesome CD that has been well worth the one year wait, since his exit from American Idol, Season 5. This CD contains rock tunes, country, and ballads. What makes this CD so wonderful is that every single song is great, so there is no need to hit the skip button. Bucky's deliciously raspy voice sings each and every track on this CD to perfection. I highly recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys great music."
5,Awesome !!!,Wow! After listening to this CD I have the upmost respect for Bucky Covington as a singer. There isn't a bad track on this CD. Bucky has you in his grasp right from the get go. He has you believing every word in his songs has happened to him and are truly his stories. When a singer can make you feel the emotions in the lyrics as much as Bucky does you know he's going to be around for a long time. Bravo Bucky!!!
1,Poor imitation of Castaneda,"Carlos Castaneda wrote a series of very well written books.....starting with a reasonably scientific, anthropological work in ""The Teachings of Don Juan"", and ending many books later in the realm of mythology. His books are eminently worth reading. This book, however, is nothing more than one woman's fantasy....trying to ride the coattails of Casteneda. It amazes me how many authors are continuing to invent more of Castaneda's Toltec ""wisdom"". I suspect Castaneda would be appalled, although he did go off the deep end at the end of his life, so perhaps he would have enjoyed the attention. In any case, if you are going to pursue a spiritual path, I would recommend that this is not the place to begin. Try something with some REAL history.....say Buddhism...or Sufism...or Yoga. Don't waste your valuable time on pseudo-Castaneda nonsense."
3,Better than you think,"When I saw Let That Be the Reason, I thought, 'Oh great, another Coldest Winter Ever knock off.' The book surprised me. It is another of the new urban street novels but it's not a clone. If you read the ghetto fairy tale True to the Game or B-More Careful then Reason is the book for you. It's better written, edited and plotted than both of those books and it makes sense. Pam aka Carmen is done very well. I couldn't agree with her decisions but the author shows why she made them. The ending was sad but realistic. So, is this book as good as Coldest Winter? No, Sistah Souljah's crown is still firmly on her head but unlike True to the Game and B-more, Let That Be the Reason is good enough to be in the same category."
4,LET THAT BE THE DAMN REASON!!!!!!,"this book was off the damn chain wit it. i liked this book cause it showed a different side of the ""game"" ! from a womens view. carmen did her thang no doubt and she made sure she did hers so dat her son didnt want fa nothin. this book kept me on my heels all the way through. i read this book within a two day period and i would recommend it to anyone. now let that be the reason this book is at the top of ya must read book list ! thats wassup"
2,Poorly written,"I accidently came across the novel after meeting the author at an Expo in Chicago. Unfortunatley, the book which is touted to be a gritty, urban tale was a little stiff, especially the dialogue, and lost its focus at times. Sometimes the character's actions were completely off-base, and the ending was totally rushed. The introduction of vital characters toward the end of the book was a crucial mistake as I wondered, where the heck does he/she fit in? This could have used a better editor and I only finished because I make it a habit of finishing every book I start. I hope Ms. Stringer does better on the next round."
3,Let That Be The Reason,This book wasn't what I expected it to be. You can t tell that this was the Author's 1st book. One thing that I hated about the book was that Pam ( Carmen) never said what her son name was. Everyone in the book kept calling him the baby. That really got on my nerves. I feel that Carmen got actually what she deserved.
4,Let That Be the Reason,"I enjoyed this book and found it to be quick reading. The second of the series "" Imagine This"" was also good."
2,it alright,"its okay, i liked the sequel better, but it was cool with the way the character carmen or pam was. as in the type of person and heart she had but all the stuff i just couldnt get into i was disapointed"
4,Great book,"This book was recommended to me by my co-worker, and when i read it, i couldn't stop reading it. It's a great read, I just didn't like because ""Carmen"" was still in love with ""Chino"" even after all the foul stuff he's done to her and still doing to her. I hope when the next book comes out, Ms. Stringer will have ""Carmen"" finally wake up and smell the coffee about her precious ""Chino""."
5,Get this one!!,This is a story that will make you think about why you do the things you do in life. It challenges your ethics and morals about chosing the game. It's a good read despite the typos. Ms. Stringer has written a book that is sure to make you think about your choices. The consequences are very well exposed for the readers. Get this book and learn the reasons.
3,better than i thought,This book started out very slow and she talked about stuff that made you yawn but as it went on it got better it had me wanting more. I can't wait until the sequel comes out in july (imagine that)i really want to know what happened to carmen a.k.a pammy
4,Worth your while,"I really enjoyed reading Let That Be The Reason. I think it was a very good book and the author did a outstanding job putting her thoughts on paper to create a crediable novel. The thing I enjoyed most about the book was that it was fact based and it didnt have a fariy-tale ending, since we all know that isnt how things go in real life. It was good to see a females view on the da game. Carmen was jut trying to make it in life, and that is why most people enter da game in the first place. Only when it is time to face the consquences, do people start to think about the decisions they have made. Ms. Stringer had a wonderful debut novel, and I will be awaiting the sequel."
4,The sistah kept it real!,"I am annoyed by those that say she didn't keep it real. After all, it IS a novel. Every detail didn't need to be spelled out nor did it have to read like an episode of ""The Wire"". For her debut novel, I think Ms. Stringer did an excellent job on ""her"" story, yes HER story. It is loosely based on her life. Characters are always going to do things the reader may not, that adds to the excitement of reading. I empathize with Pamela, she did what she thought she had to do, but for all choices we make, there are consequences. For those who want real urban fiction, you will like this book. I look forward to reading the sequel."
3,hmmmm...... ?,"it was ok, i was not quite identifying with the character,""carmen"" for her to be so in love with her ex "" chico"" after all he put her through and she was still way to dumb for him. But there was a lesson to be learned in all this, so i guess it was ok."
1,Let That Be The Reason...,"I am disappointed that I purchased this book. I am usually the one who reads a book nonstop, without putting it down. This one, NOT! Ive had this book for almost a week now and I still havent finished it. Ive actually jumped a few chapters and just started reading Chino's return to her life hoping for a bit of excitement.I am a fan of African American authors and I support them all and give them credit where its due, but this book isnt all that. This is one time I can truly say I didnt agree with the reviews given by my fellow Amazon shoppers.I give this book a 1 out of 5."
1,Not a Good Read,"It took me forever to read this book because it simply wasn't interesting. I don't like not finifshing books, so I finished it. It was one of many books passed out to the women at the shelter where I work. I thought it would be a good read, but it is not written very well and though the story is somewhat interesting...Stringer feels the need to explain the meaning of every ghetto or ""hood"" lingo or slang, some of which I had no original clue, but most which I was already aware of and explaining it on almost every page just began to annoy me. I do not recommend this book as a good read, but if you do get it, sheer curiousity will keep you turning the pages...mostly ""Could this possibly get any worse?"""
1,Just AWFULLLLLLLLLLLL,"This was my first time reading a book by this author and it will be my last! This was thee worst book that I have every read. Let That BE The Reason no one else suffers though this book. I understand that this is fiction, but I know women in the game that are single mother n trust and believe that if a deadbeat that never did anything for your son and after you put him on he still does nothing and You keep suppling him so that his other family can eat just isn't going to happen. She was so dumb that it was unreal. I just don't know what more I can say about this dumb azz book except for DON'T WASTE UR MONEY OR TIME TRYING TO READ THIS MESS ITS JUST PLAIN AWFUL!"
2,Piece of Crap From What I Read,"Well I can not comment on the entire book because I could not finish it. Her writing style was not for me and it was boring. It started off interesting and then I just lost interest. Now I LOVE B-More Careful, The Coldest Winter Ever, and I even like A Hustler's Wife better. Its not that I don't like street books. She just didn't hold it down for me. I read a couple of chapters and I just couldn't force myself to keep reading."
2,It took to long!!!!!!!!,"Although I must admit the ending was somewhat good, it took me almost 2 weeks to finish this book, when it normally take me no longer than 2 day to finish a book. I'm sorry Vicki but this did not do it for me...It was all over the place and hard to keep up with...but I am going to get the sequel to see what happens with our girls Carmen/Pammy...."
2,Should have bought book used.....,"Some reviews mentioned a comparison to ""The Coldest Winter Ever"". There is absolutely no comparison to be made, ""Winter"" was incredibly well written and this author is still fine tuning her skills. This book didn't develop the characters enough, and left me with an empty feeling at the end. I would read the next book by Ms. Stringer only to see if her writing has advanced, because I see potential for a good book."
2,OKAY NEXT,GOTTA BE HONEST THIS BOOK WAS VERY MEDIOKER FOR ME BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME.LET THIS BE THE REASON YOU DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Let That Be The Reason Ms. Stringer Works on her writing.......,"I am mad because this book was so hyped up. Let That Be The Reason is the story of Pamela Xavier b.k.a. Carmen. After being left to dry in the streets by her only lover, baby's father, and sole provider Chino, Pam takes her life into her own hands. Chino took everything from her including her pride when he gave away her 50,000 hait salon. After doing a short stint as a call girl, she starts her own escort service and changes her name to Carmen. Then greed set in and she got into the dope game. ""Carmen"" was doing it big in the streets--so big she started taking food out of Chino's mouth. Will they get back together? How will Carmen get out of this street life? You have to cop the book. I had more pleasure reading he afterword then I did the book. I felt that the story wasn't developed enough but I do commend Ms. Stringer for her compelling words at the end."
5,Funny and True,"I learned about the book from a friend. My friend mentioned the book because I had started using the slogan, ""Let that be the reason"", which I picked up from another friend. I had no idea this slogan was a book. I researched the title on Amazon and I am soooooo glad I found it. The book is awesome, entertaining, enlightening, and very funny. The gurl had game and brains. I havent finished it yet but i am truely enjoying the book and intend on reading the author's other books. Great read."
3,Not as bad as I thought,"Ok, when I first started reading this book I must say it was boring. I honestly didnt know why everyone was telling me it was a must read, I finally finished reading the book and it was worth finishing it was slow in the beginning but it picked up towards the end. I must admit Im waiting to read the 2nd part. I'll read it this weekend and post my opinion."
5,A must cd,"This is a great CD. There are terrific songs, Vision of Rasson, spill the wine and tobbaco road are classics songs. Everyone who love music must buy this cd."
3,ok cd,"Very experimental cd. Too different musical styles combined. The only real reason to buy this cd is for ""spill the wine""."
5,Great seller,Amazon does such a great job with their shipping. I am happy shopping on this site simply because most of what I want I find and Amazon is happy to work with me the right way.
4,Could be slicker,"They provided pictures that do not expose the product's depth, which caused me to beleive this Pocket PC would be much slicker than the E115, based on the hype earlier this year on the new PocketPCs.Besides, that seems great improvement to the E-100 - notably faster, with much better sound quality, headphones, stylish case and the new WIdnows version - which itself became less memory and CPU time hug.This is much more consumer-satisfying device than ever a WinCE device managed to be. The only exception may be the iPAQ (COMPAQs PocketPC) that I am still to put my hands on it.Oh yeah: the yellow color could be brighter :)"
2,Disappointed,The ball does not pop up very high at all.Sometimes a ball gets stuck and there is no way to shut it off so you can put your hand in and fish it out.The beeping is very loud.
3,Skip this toy,My husband and I purchased this toy for our 5 year for christmas. We have an unfinished basement so we let him play this downstairs. (It's too cold to play outside now.) The toy is fun when it actually works. Many times the balls get stuck. It's very frustrating constantly trying to get them to actually pop out. When they do sometimes they are too low to hit. We haven't yet tried to play t-ball with it. It's fairly light so it's possible it may tip over many times. I find that the pieces are pretty durable. My son does continue to play it but he often stops cause it gets frustrating. He sometimes just plays with the balls and bat so it wasn't a total loss.
2,Disappointed,"We gave this toy to our 4 year old son. That was 1 1/2 years ago. It worked at first, but the balls did not pop up high enough for him to hit. After about 1 month, the balls did not pop up at all. Little Tikes replaced it with a completely new toy. Again, it worked for a few months, but now it does not work. The beeps sound (a nice feature), but nothing happens. My son has given up on the automatic feature and will sometimes use it as a t-ball stand. Most of the balls are lost. Thank goodness I only paid $10 for this on sale - but not even worth that much!"
3,Not Tough Enough to Stand Up to a Nine-year-old Brother,"We bought this for our two-year-old daughter, who loves sports, for Christmas. The very first time we played with it, our nine-year-old son was demonstrating it to our daughter, and he broke the stand!Now granted, nine-year-old boys can be tough on anything and everything, but he was actually being (relatively) gentle for the purposes of the demo. I think he had his foot on the base when he hit the ball (and the tee) but that is still a topic of debate.We still use it for t-ball, which is fine since our daughter still has some time before she can hit a moving ball. But I am disappointed in the quality, as we've had always had excellent luck with Little Tike toys.Fortunately, its still a good price just make sure older siblings (and Dads) are cautious not to stand on the base or hit the tee when they make contact with the ball."
1,not working well at all,"This calculator has been a problem since arrival. First the tape does not feed straight and it is constantly jammed. The ink roller is very difficult to replace and is constantly running out. As a CPA, I need a calculator that is trouble free. This is not . I wish I could return this but do not have the box it came in."
5,Very Happy!,"My husband the accountant is very happy, both workings and price. He especially likes the date and time feature. And I don't want to think up 20 total words."
3,Not for downspouts!,"For other: undetermined -- probably fine.For 2"" galvanized downspouts: FailI bought this mistakenly thinking I could use it for 2"" galvanized downspouts. It completely failed; I could not join downspouts where the male end is formed using this tool. When I cam back to this page I saw a reference to the Malco C4 crimper which specifically is for downspouts -- I have ordered the C4 and will report accordingly.The 3 start rating is not for the quality of the tool (it appears heftily built), but the intended use. It would behoove the vendor to reference the C4 crimper in the above description thereby educating a would-be purchaser who might have in mind using a crimper for downspouts. It's my guess this is a lighter duty crimper than the C4.I'm going to keep this tool in my arsenal."
1,Great price but hard to use features!,"I purchase this phone for my bedroom for caller ID and due to the price for $9.99, I got it today and the direction are impossible as person that can usually figure technology out- I was frustrated and I couldn't get the clock to set and using the caller ID Features such as redialing and storing a number in the memory. I would not by this phone go some were else for the price. I even win on the website and they have know information and know email they do have a phone number but how could they help you over the phone. and even Google it for help and know help I read one review that got the clock set and doesn't stay-I can't even get the clock to set. DON'T BUY IT YOU WILL WANT TO SEND IT BACK IMMEDIATELY!Best wishes.Josef HolzerJust trust me is not worth it!"
3,Difficult to read caller-id.,"Nice for the price. Easy to set up, sound quality is fine. My only complaint is the caller-id feature. The screen is very difficult for me to read. It makes the caller-id feature virtually unusable for me."
3,not a good value,"The cord is too short, and the display is almost unreadable. The voice sounds so tinny. Not a very good value"
3,Cheap (cost) phone,It is an inexpensive phone that works ok. Nothing great but does what I wanted for a cheap price.
1,worst thing on Amazon!,"I hate it, stopped ringing a couple months after i purchased it, nobody can hear me when i call or receive a call. don't waste your money."
4,Not a bad product,"Nice phone for the money. LCD is not the greatest. No backlight. I had to turn up the contrast to see it better. Not bad thouth.Keys are nice and solid. Ringer is a little annoying. Sound quality is just ok. Phone is a little slim so the base it mounts to shows. It was silver so I had to paint it white so it would look better.All in all, not bad for the money. Glad I got it."
3,Low Cost but Functional (Most of the Time),"jWin is not a premium brand, but they try to load a lot of features into their products. But there are some limitations with this unit such as:- non lit caller id screen- limited visibility of caller id screen (based on angle of viewing)- low sound on hand set (you may have to strain your ears a bit)The conclusion here is simple, you get what you pay for. Also there is a chance that you may end up with a defective unit (estimated probability of getting a lemon is about 5-10%).Also, you will want to consider the shipping cost associated with this product, since this will not be refundable, if you are not satisfied."
3,good for price,"The phone works fine but as someone else mentioned, every time a call comes in a red light flashes until you delete it. If you have the phone in a room you don't use regularly the battery could run down."
3,"Nice ring, short cord",This was purchased for emergencies for when the power fails. It has a decent ring but the spiral phone cord is a bit short!
1,Cheap price = cheap product,"the caller ID screen is not backlit, and the font is so thin that it's hard to determine what it even displays. The keys for dialing look and feel like they were made for a toy phone. Everything about this product screams ""CHEAP"". Looks nice hanging on the wall, but that's where the attractive nature of this product ends. My advice is look for another phone, and avoid this junk."
4,corded phone,Works - use it just in case we have a power outage. The cordless phones don't work when the power goes out.
4,brutal metal,this is a great band that is way more agressive than regular metalcore. there are great guitar riffs the screaming is good and the drums are fast and pulse pounding. Bring out your dead and misery dance are the best songs. this gets 4 stars because the filler on the cd is crap like serpent and the flower and last words of any meaning.
4,Band with monster potential,"I was able to hear this fine band on Xtreme Metal Radio at live365.com for the first time a couple months ago. I must say this is some agreesive metalcore. I do agree with other reviewers here, as the vocals is holding them back somewhat. Though I have to disagree on if you like Walls of Jericho you will like this band. Anyways give this band a listen."
