3,"If you like Crowley, you'll like this book","Heavily biased and apologetic in favor of Crwowley, but still worth a read. Not a long book tho, and written in an outdated style."
5,Great Collection,"I wouldn't consider myself one to purchase a Frankie and the Four Seaons CD (I mean look how dorky they look on the CD cover!) - but don't be decieved - this is a masterpiece.""Lets hang on"" has great hook and is one of my favorites. I got the CD coz I'd heard ""December 1963"" in the past, liked it but didn't know who performed it. One of the better purchases I've made in 2006."
5,just need tro ask a question b/4 i purchase,would like to know if swearin to god is the 10 min version and not the 3 min version i already have the 45 version
5,Go 4 Seasons!,My granddaughter is a huge fan of the Four Seasons and Frankie Valli ever since she saw the play Jersey Boys!
4,Nothing but Da Truth!!,"This is a great concert/worship experience and I plan to share it with my youth group at one of our movie nights. I would have given it 5 stars if it was longer, however it is good video for the collection."
4,"The only choice, no literally the only choice!","I have the IPAQ 4150, which is limited in the accessory department. I first bought an IR keyboard to find the transmitter wouldn't work with my IPAQ due to the fact the IR port is on the bottom of the unit. So after a trip back to the store, I broke down and bought the HP brand. I wish I had bought it here, because my local electronics store was twenty dollars more. My only complaint is the keyboard wobbles while typing, because the back support rest is about half an inch to short to prevent this. One could probably fix this by weighting the back end a bit."
3,Nice keyboard as long as it lasts,"I first bought this keyboard in 2004. I used it from time to time and was quite pleased with it until certain keys suddenly no longer worked. Hewlett Packard replaced it as it was still under warranty. A few months later, the same keys (P, O, etc.) suddenly stopped working on the replacement keyboard. The ribbon cable on the right side of the keyboard (inside, you can't see it) is about 1/4 inch too short so that opening and closing the keyboard puts a tension on the cable which eventually causes it to break. It could possibly be avoided if you open the keyboard slowly and very gently. It seems to be the only keyboard that does not need batteries. I would consider buying another one, but it's too bad that HP didn't add another quarter inch of play to the cable."
1,"Get real, this is not a Bluetooth keyboard!","Eventhough Amazon represents it as a Bluetooth HP FA287A#AC3, it is NOT, it is the FA118 that they send you. They did it to me twice and they haven't credited my account for the mistake. What Amazon is selling is the older version direct connect keyboard not the new wireless version. The older version won't even connect to the new hx4700 IPAQ as they claim. Don't be foooled like I was..."
4,Good Keyboard!,"This does the job. It does seem to be a little delicate, so I open and close it very slowly and carefully, but once it is open, it does a great job. I had a little trouble with repeating keys at first, but once I turned on the keyboard sound, I can tell when it is happening before I look up and see 500 X's on the screen. It was worth the money."
4,Great Keyboard! first one lasted 2 years... could be better,this keyboard is very compact! it is well made and looks good too!
1,Not as represented,Ordered for my HP4705. This is not a bluetooth keyboard. they sent two of them both the same non-bluetooth item. Now I have to send back and hope I get credit.
2,another mistake by me,I purchased this thinking it will be less oily. Yes it is not oily but did absolutely nothing for me. Its too expensive for the results achieved. I am considering trying another product line going forward
4,Dance Fans Check This,"Wow,I heard this track at 1:00 this morning and liked it right away. It's cool and the more I hear of her cd the more I have to give her credit. I hope I hear some dj's spinning this one, this is a well done effort. Go Paris! As to the negative things I've seen posted in reviews on Amazon, please remember a couple of things. ALL singers who record have their voices processed in some way. That's how it works and for various valid reasons. After listening to recorded music for thirty years I will say that Paris seems to have a very nice voice and it does not sound overly processed to me. I'd rather listen to her than just-another-clone-indie-rock-band ""singing"" about how much suburban angst they posses. If you have an open mind, dance around the house to this."
5,Outstanding!,"THE SON OF JOHN DEVLIN is a highly accomplished, character-driven novel that deals with corruption within the Boston Police Department.Charles Kenney offers up an insightful police procedural that is at once tough and gritty, yet compassionate. It's rare that a writer of this genre can pull this off convincingly, but Kenney certainly does.With its themes of father-son love, betrayal and redemption, THE SON OF JOHN DEVLIN is a satisfying read on many levels, a true page-turner in every sense of the word."
1,Do not buy this....... Jult Warfell,I enjoyed the beanie I received from the series but the stories just dragged on and on. It has taken me nearly 2 years to watch this series. Mannnnnnnnnn! another 600+ minutes of my life wasted. A waste of talent and time put into dub. Jult Warfell
1,Worst Alarm Clock Ever,"This has to be the stupidest design ever conceived for an alarm clock. The ""touchscreen"" controls might sound sleek, but it takes just one touch of the screen in the wrong place to unknowingly turn the alarm on or off. Imagine how irritating this is when discovered upon oversleeping on a workday; even more so when the opposite occurs on a weekend, and you find yourself jolted awake at an ungodly hour. And unlike traditional electric alarm clocks, there is no easy way to see that the alarm is on or off; it's visible in LCD letters, but it doesn't stand out like that familiar red dot."
2,Not worth the hype,"So I bought it for the hype of being able to use a touch screen, but the novelty wears off real quick. It does not have a snooze button, in order to set the time you need to to through the hours and min by contently pressing the + or - button, a major pain. I wouldn't recommend it, get one with a snooze button at least."
4,All fantasy and SciFi fans should read this .,"Not only is this a work of great scholarship and research it is also valuable in that it will educate the reader on the history of SciFi. However its focus is not history, but research into the possibilities of language and communication that could exist among alien species. The history aspect comes into play because Mr. Meyers sites so many examples from so many books by a plethora of authors. Some of the authors are from the early days of SciFi and some are more recent...well recent when the book was written. If you can find this book, get it. If you get it dedicate yourself to reading it for it is a valuable tool for learning much about ourselves."
3,Worth the price,"I paid only 6.99 for this box set. Well worth it. My son liked small action figures and I figured for 6.99 you couldn't go wrong. They are hero clix. Not like GI joes or other action figures. We still have them, but most are broken off their bases (they are fragile)."
4,The BIG day....................,"It almost Amy's Birthday,and she's psyched!she's had some strange growing pains lately,but she doesn't think much of it,Hey,even clones get aches and pains sometime,right?Well,on her birthday Amy's growing pains well,have taken on large perportians....Now due to a long forgotten chip placed in her back in Project Cresent,Amy is trapped in the body of a 25 year-old....Dr.Hopkins rushes her to a private room in a hospital where he can run tests to find the chip so Amy can go back to normal.....But after a while Amy's had it!She's sck of staying in bed in the same room,without any contact with her friends,so she runs away.She meets a young boy on the street and he takesher to a place called The Sanctuary,where homeless children go,but the place isn't exactly legal,and the guy in charge isn't exactly sane either...My opinion: Great book,but not the Best....I'd say 4&1/2 stars.....I think this is a must-buy for replica fans!!!!Hope this was helpful to you!"
2,THE13 YEARS OF AMY,"THIS BOOK WAS PRETY GOOD.IT WASN'T REALLY A PAGE TURNER LIKE THE OTHERS,BUT IS PRETY VITAL TO READ.I READ SOME OF THE BOOKS OUT OF ORDER AND IT KEPT MENTIONING SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPEND IN THIS BOOK!SO I WOULD STRONLY SUGGEST THAT YOU READ THIS BOOK!!!!!"
3,Weird but good.,"I would give this book 3 and a half but I can't so oh well! This book is about a girl named Amy(duh!) and how on the day of her 13th birthday is taken on some changes. And these aren't little changes but big ones like lets say...TURNING INTO AN ADULT IN ONE NIGHT! I think the idea wasn't that good, but it wasn't the worst. And how can the laser hit a small part in her body. It wasn't that beleivable and this book wasn't my favorite but it passes the time."
5,Great Shoe for the Norm,This is a great shoe that forms well to the foot just after a couple of runs. It is for someone that is not a heavy pronator and wants to enjoy the ride. They last just close to a year for me and that is in the area of 400 miles. Great shoes especially if your new.
4,Brooks shoes,"Shoes are what I expected, excellent quality and affordable price along with reasonable shipping. I'm a big (240) and the support is second to none."
2,Why no audio??,"I am so disappointed. I bought the 1st 3 books in this series as unabridged audiobooks, and they were just GREAT. Now, the 4th isn't offerred. I called Brilliance audio, but they said none is forthcoming. In defiance, I got this book from the library, instead of buying it. But I just can't get interested. The audio books were very well read, and the accents and the pace kept the story interesting. These books don't have a huge amount of variety, so that helped considerably. Please, Mr. Drake. You won't be getting any more of my money unless you publish in audio form."
1,Printing issues abound with HP Inkjet 2200,"The hp business inkjet 2200 will provide very nice quality printing of text and photos for awhile. But at some point, all the sudden without warning, photos will print with horizontal lines across them. You will buy expensive new cartridges ($36 each), follow the maintenance procedures for realligning and cleaning printheads and the print quality will actually get worse. Also, you will put in new ink cartridges (hp brand, not a knock-off) and within a week it will tell you the ink needs to be replaced even when you only printed a few things. I do NOT recommend this printer. Take it to recycle shop and buy a new printer... do not waste your money on new ink or your time."
1,Thumbs WAY DOWN!!!,"It seems as if this book is meant for the advanced statistics student. Teaching myself multiple regression for an independent study, this is not the book to use!! (I was assigned the book, this wasn't voluntary!) Author uses ""I"" this and ""I"" that far too many times. Also, gives very complicated examples that are extremely difficult to follow. Also, author will explain, for example, something in Chapter 7, but then says that the topic will be discussed in Chapter 9!! There are far too many references to future chapters. How am I supposed to know what he is talking about if I don't read the book in reverse!!! This over 1000-page-book could've have been written in probably more like 500 pages. Terrible, terrible, terrible. If I could, I would demand my money back. I now have to pay for another book to learn. PLEASE, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!"
4,nokia bluetooth,well i pruchased this a couple years ago i think and it was very good on the ear the only thing about it was the sound was not very loud no matter how loud you turned it up.but overall it worked for me...but i dont need it anymore..i got the lg wireless bluetooth now sooooo thats that on that thanks amazon...ps whenever i do pruchase from you ..it is always great..see ya Regina Drayton
1,This one don't work,"This bluetooth do not work, I want to give to my friend.He did get it, but it just do not work."
4,Kids are nuts about nuts and bolts,"I bought these for my 17 month old to help with his motor skills. He seems to enjoy dumping them on the floor a bit more than actually playing with them, but he does assemble them by color and shape fairly well - with some guidance! Overall a very good toy."
5,the ultimate rock band,"It doesn't get more Rock and Roll than Motley Crue! These guys have gone to hell and back (for real, Nikki died man), and their story is sure to have your jaw draging on the floor for days. Motley is one of the most underrated bands in rock history. Watch this Behind the Music (the best episode yet), and rediscover your love for Motley Crue. A Rock and Roll lifestyle at its best, and worst."
5,Cruehead's wish,I love this VHS! It's so wonderful. It's everything I imagined and more! Any Cruehead would love to add this to their motley collection. It goes through motley's career up until the 2000s.
2,VH1?,"Well, the review before mine said it best. This is as old as i have ever felt. I am 25 and i am watching Crue on VH1. This whole show was horrible. It covered everything that we already knew. No new questions. No tough ones either.To sum it up.HIghlights: Finding out how Vince coped with the death of his daughter.(still very saddening to this day) Lowlights: The whole interview, and looking at Vince pushing about 250 lbs."
4,The Honest Motley Truth,"An excellent documentary on the history of Motley Crue. The quality of the picture and sound is great. The only thing I wish they had done was to remove the editing on this DVD. In the U.S. apparently VH1 is a television show or something, but I've never heard of it in Canada. The editing should have been fine for television, but on DVD, they could have removed the beeps over the foul language and distortion over the nudity.Other than that this is the DVD to get if you are a Crue fan, or interested in the history of 80/90's metal/rock bands.This is not a hype DVD like Uncensored or anything like that. This seriously follows the life of the members of Motley Crue. Each member had a great story to tell. Vince Neil's daughter & car accident, the celebrity marriages, drug overdoses, arrests, it's all here, and told honestly."
1,Buyer Beware!,"This title was originally advertised as the ""Video Collection"" and was supposed to contain all the classic Crue videos in Dolby Digital 5.1. Instead, it is simply a repackaging of the VH1 Behing The Music special and the sound is only 2.0. This is a huge let-down!"
5,I like it!,"I'm a girl, okay? Not a tech-head girl either. The last VCR I bought was years ago, and it was going on the blink. So I knew I needed to get with the DVD program, but still had all these tapes! So I wouldn't look like I was buying myself a new toy, I bought it for my husband's birthday. Since it was a surprise, I had to wait until he was out of the house to install it. I ran home on my lunch hour, hooked it up, and learned most of the functions by the time I had everything straightened up and had to rush back out.So - it's easy to hook up, it's easy to operate. No loud noises, everything works as it should. Yes, the buttons are tiny on the remote. It looks good and I would recommend this for anyone scared to buy. Don't be."
4,"Works great, but just one prob.....","I don't have any issues with noise, like the other posters, and the progressive scanning is simple to use. I've viewed new and old VHS tapes, recorded with it, works perfect. I've played CDS, MP3s and DVD-R with no prob.I've had no problems using rented (and worn, scratched) DVDs and most of the time it works perfect. However, just about every other DVD I watch will ""lock up"" in the middle of a movie, (pausing, but the only way to release the pause would be to skip back a few frames and push play) not the DVDs-happens with new ones as well. The local repair shop apparently can't work on combo players and I would have to ship it to Sony on my own---not worth risking it to me, so I'll just live with that one prob.--other than that--I happened to get it cheap, because the older model I picked out was out of stock, so I got it as they just received it in store that day at the older model's price....so I think it was worth it, and I'm happy with it..."
1,Sony Quality on the Decline,"I purchased the first Sony DVD/VCR combo and it worked great, for about 4 weeks. Then half way though a movie it started jumping from scene to scene before it froze up. I tried a couple of different disks but all I get in return are error messages. I received a replacement unit and on this one the DVD player only works on half of the disks I've tried. The other half I get ""can't read disk, clean disk, error"", etc... These are the same disks that worked fine on my original unit until the crash that is, and they all work fine on my Marantz 6400. I really like the way the Sony 500P interfaced with my Wega TV but it seems like Sony is just interested in selling low quality DVD players"
2,Do not buy this product,"My unit quit reading all DVD's. I was very disappointed and surprised because I bought a Sony because I thought it would be more reliable, and I only use my DVD player maybe once a week to watch a movie. I am not a heavy user and still it quit working. When I called Sony, they informed me I could either get it repaired for $169 or get a refurbished one for $109...since mine is practically brand new why would I do that..who knows what I would get as a replacement.So I bought a different DVD player, not Sony, to replace the non-working one for less than half the price of their offers. The VCR still works fine. No explanation was given why this happened."
1,Won't play DVDs-don't buy!,Made a huge mistake with this unit as I played all VCR's--tried a DVD once and saw it did not work but I thought it was the hook-up so I never returned it. Now I want to play DVD's and the hook-up is correct but the picture is double and twisted. Discussed problem on-line with Sony and they told me it needed servicing. We hardly even used it all.It plays VCRs fine but not commercially produced DVDs. Totally worthless and not worth fixing.
3,Don't believe the claim that it will play MP3s,"I've had this unit for 3 or 4 years now and, overall, it performs its functions well. It's played every DVD I've thrown at it, as well as most JPEGs; and its rewind is blindingly fast. HOWEVER, don't believe its claim to play MP3s -- it won't and the manual even says it won't play them! In fact, of the 4 or 5 friend that own Sony's only one's unit will play MP3s. If that's important to you, take the safe route and choose another brand."
2,I was very happy with the unit.....then the sound stopped working,"The sound for the DVD just stopped working, but the VCR sound is ok. After trouble shooting the problem myself and then calling the tech line I have to send the unit in to the factory.I was informed that I will be getting a refurbished unit in return and it may not even be the same model I am sending them. I will have to wait and see what I get and if I am happy with it.The replacement cost is $33 but I am not sure if they will also add shipping to that.I have owned many great Sony products in the past, hope this is just a fluke"
1,Hardware problems ruin Hotas Cougar.,"I always loved Thrustmaster products but the Hotas Cougar is a dud. Far too many of the units have hardware problems. Mine has a problem that every few minutes causes the computer to think that it is not attached to the computer. It loses calibration when it does this. After a lot of effort I got the company to accept a return on it, but they sent it back saying it was fine. I have bought the CH products controllers and have had absolutely no problems. They are the way to go."
2,the reviews tell you what you need to know if you read closely,"based upon the remarks for this product, i wonder why anyone would pay twice as much for a product that has so many wear issues? sounds like their customer service is indifferent, if not sleazy too. would seem to be an issue of popularity going to a manufactures head and not keeping up with the competition: the typical mistake of the bourgeois. i'm going to buy from their competitors: customer service is better apparently, and they are half the price, not to mention the quality seems to be better with #2.~meehall (you can always trust an irishman!)"
2,Hotas Couger Review,I have Windows XP and I am having driver problems. So at this point this device isn't worth a damn.
1,Immediate Bad POT,Feels great but I too have been burned with a bad POT. If this was a car it would be recalled immediately ! Too bad they did not go to extreme measures to ensure a quality product. Looks feels great. Currently just a nice looking conversation piece.Still waiting on my replacement POT.........
4,TM Cougar...As advertised,"Reader,Happy..well..yeah! First let me say thanks to Amazon..the order got here as fast as the system allowed. Free shipping was not an excuse for ""lets get it to the cusomer the last day.."" To Amazon..I'll be back.. I am a very satisfied customer.Second did it work out of the box? Yes..as sdvertised Took all of 10 minutes to plug in and install..B-sure to read the pre-install notes before plugging Cougar into your computer. The hook up is sequence dependent and can be confusing if not followed. That 3 second task out of the way you can are off to wild blue yonder.These bad boy's ain't cheap so do your research."
1,Works Great for a few months....then croaks!!!,"This is truly an impressive joystick/throttle combination. I was overjoyed when I got this as a gift. It worked great for the first few months of use. Unfortunately, the system fell into disrepair, mainly because of poor quality pots. This is a common problem with these units. After spending an entire day taking apart the throttle and cleaning the pots with jewelers glases, reinstalling the firmware and finally giving up, I am looking for a replacement. It REALLY BUGS ME to see what was spent on this item and see how shabbily it was constructed. LET THE BUYER BEWARE !!!"
2,Badly disappointed,"At a cost of $269 this was touted as ""the last joystick (HOTAS) you'll ever buy."" Wrong!! In less than 2 months, the potentiometers (pots) started giving out and caused a lot of stick spike in Aces High. Thrustmaster pointed me to Amazon and Amazon pointed me to Thrustmaster. I pointed to a hole in my wallet and a stick that was barely usable. This seems to be a well known problem and new pots can be had for another hundred bucks. I sold mine as is, took a $100 hit and bought CH USB stick, throttle and peds. It will be a cold day in hell before I spent another nickel with Thrustmaster."
3,almost perfect,"best system you can buy, but only problems are the throttle control will not work , it cannot be calibrated , its a software problem that thrust master will not fix , in fact they haven't done anything with it for a couple years now , so i suggest YOU BUY THE JOYSTICK BUT NOT THE THROTTLE CONTROL. THE THROTTLE CONTROL WILL NOT WORK UNTILL THRUST MASTER PUTS OUT A PATCH FOR IT , BUT THEY HAVNT DONE ANYTHING IN 2 YEARS TO FIX IT NOR DO I THINK THEY WILL ,,,, BOTTOM LINE JUST GET THE JOYSTICK CUZ THROTTLE WIL NOT WORK RIGHT"
5,HOTAS is Hot,"Great stick and throttle combination, easy to connect and use. I haven't changed the programing yet so I can't speak to that."
4,The hacker's joystick,"I own one of these. This is the Slackware Linux of joysticks. It is definitely made for the tinkering enthusiast, not the average Joe. If you are not a bit of a geek, this is not for you, because it works best when you custom program it. Once you master the language you can control all the axis on the joystick and throttle, as well as physical and logical buttons, and simulate a mouse. There are so many combinations, you can implement the bulk of any flight sim controls into them, the problem is remembering which combination does what."
2,Sure doesn't feel like an airplane,"I only want to comment with respect to the disappointing elevator/aileron ""feel"" of the Hotas Cougar Joystick. I had hoped it would mimic the gliding, effortless, detent-free feel joystick feel that makes flying an aircraft such as the Lancair 360 such sheer extacy. Instead the Cougar is a clumsy control that one has to horse around to perform even a simple coordinated turn. I just remembered what it reminded me of, the fawcet lever on my kitchen sink.It't too bad the Cougar may represent the state of the art of joysticks because for it takes much of the fun out of of sim flight. Flying an airplane with it feels more like driving a tank."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"Ordered the book on 9/3/08. Finally got a reply to numerous e-mails on 9/10/08 that the book would mail ""tomorrow"". As of today, 10/6/08, I still have not received the book I ordered. I'll apply for a refund, but am not holding my breath. Buyer Beware!"
5,Millicents Gift,"I read Millicent's Gift. I thought it was a great book. I liked because it had some adventure and there was a lot of details so you could picture where they were. I think other kids ten or higher would love to read it too. I recommend this book it is a great book to read and other kids should read it too. It is the best book I ever read. Anyone who sees this should read it's think u would like it too. It's at the top my list for books. If you have interests in magic, cops, and courts, this would be a good book for you."
4,Strong and Powerful,"Millicent's Gift is a powerful story. A young girl is faced with challenges, descisions, and truths that she has to learn to accept. The foundation is very solid, but the plot can be a bit hard to follow. Over all, worth the time, but for older readers."
1,I hated it!!,"It wasn't the type of book I would normally read, but I desided I would give it a try. It took me FOREVER to get through the first chapters!! It was sooo boring! I gave up reading it half way through the book because it was still so boring.It hadn't even gotten to the point of the story! You may say I'm not quilafied to write a review on a book that I haven't read all of but, personally, I think any book that doesen't have you intrested half way through the book, deserves a one. If you like slow-moving stories, this books for you!!!"
1,the secret of the rosary.,book has been altered and majority of book has been changed.I had book 20 yrs agomit has been rewritten for the worst!
5,Just beautiful and invaluable,"To a practicing Catholic, this little, very accessible book on the Rosary is a real blessing to find. Absolutely no other book has helped me understand the value of the Rosary better. St. Louis de Monfort loved the Virgin Mary very much, it's obvious, and writes about her and the Rosary with passion, faith and conviction."
1,Worst Alarm Clock I Have Ever Owned,"First of all, I must say that you shouldn't believe the claims that this alarm clock has a battery back up feature, as my power has gone out several times and it has never worked. Also, I have yet to find a button on this thing that will actually turn the alarm feature OFF. Which means that someone like myself, who works a rotating schedule, must always remember to reset the alarm to a later time or else wake up at the crack of dawn on their day off. There are so many buttons on the top of this alarm clock that it's very difficult to hit the actual snooze button when you're half asleep. Don't waste your money on this one!"
4,Really Neat Clock,"when I was living at home, I used a stereo to wake myself up in the morning. The trouble was, I got too used to sleeping with music on that I would always sleep past the alarm. My parents sent me this clock in graduate school to wake me up. I really like the gradual waking feature, which doesn't wake up up abruptly, but the alarm gradually gets louder. The nap function is also wonderful because you can sleep by it or you can time things like food or laundry. The only problem I had with it was the fact that the alarm will turn on at the set time every day unless you cancel it. I once forgot to cancel the alarm when I went home for a weekend and my apartment mates were very cranky when I got back. It's a very loud alarm, I don't blame them. Overally, it's a really good alarm clock, but you need to remember to cancel the alarm when you don't want it."
3,It's...ok,"hilarious rants about this poor little guy; it's compact enough, never realized how gigantic the cord is 'till mentioned. Keep the manual nearby, settings and cancelings are so not intuitive. Not an a.m. person, gradual wake is appreciated, surprisingly decent sound, good for price"
3,Beautiful watch but be wary of quality,"I owned this watch for 2.5 years before it stopped working suddenly. It's listed at over $200 now but I bought mine on amazon for just under $100 so i'm suspecting that the price may be inflated a bit. The watch itself is beautiful and I received more compliments than I can remember about how nice or curious the skeleton feature looks. In terms of looks, it's a 10 but a watch that is now listed at about $225 ought to last longer than 2.5 years, especially as it is a dress watch and should not be used during sports or running."
5,Great watch,I have this watch and I love it. Very high quality feeling and great looking overall. People comment on it all the time. I own many watches and this one gets worn lots more than most of my others. I have even had a guy try to buy it off of me at a diner! I felt great about that. NO..I didn't sell it to him! I just told him to check out Amazon for Invicta 9839.
2,"Save your $, get the documentation subscription","Poorly edited, seems to have been largely copied pieces of the JBoss documentation. Save your money and get the JBoss documentation subscription or the stuff from http://www.coredevelopers.net/"
1,Worst Book on JBoss,"This is a replication of JBoss Administration Guide published by the JBoss.org. This book is poorly organised and doesn't serve the purpose of what this is meant to be. The topics discussed in this book require more description and depth. Most of the chapters are incomplete and not accurate, such as securing JMX console and implementing SSL on JBoss. You can save some $$ by sticking to the official online doco published by JBoss.org.You'll find nothing new in this and you'll learn nothing!!save your money - DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!!"
1,Absolutely TERRIBLE!,"There is a free tutorial by JBoss themselves at:http://www.jboss.org/docs/index#free-32xThis book, I think, is a very bad rewrite of that tutorial. It explains NOTHING to the beginner and can't possibly give any normal information to a user that is already familiar with JBoss.DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!"
5,Great alarm clock,We just ordered two more of the Westclox Triads. We have had one for about five years and have never seen a better clock for bedroom use. You don't have to be 100% awake to read those large numerals from across the room. We ordered the two for gifts since so many people ask about ours.
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"PURCHASED WESCLOX TIAD DIGITAL ALARM CLOCK MODEL#66705... WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK. ASIDE FROM RUNNING A LITTLE FAST, THE ALARM DOES NOT WORK, THE BATTERY BACK UP DOES NOT STORE ANY INFORMATION, AND THE NUMBERS ARE LARGE AND VERY BRIGHT WITH NO DIMMING FEATURE. WHY WOULD I NEED THIS CLOCK?"
3,"I Like The Clock, But Not The Price.","This clock has been a great addition to my bedroom. The numbers are large and bright, so it's easy to see in the dark. That's exactly what I was looking for. The only problem I have is the price. I was recently in a store and saw the same clock at a cheaper price (not on sale). For the price I paid for this one I could have gotten an atomic clock that has a lot more features, including an illuminated display. So all in all - great clock. I just think the price should be reduced."
3,Frankie Valli & the $ Seasons Greatest Hits Vo. 1,If I had not heard the Jersey Boys soundtrack I would have given this album a 5. It was good. Some of the songs were even great. There was one song I had never heard in my life. I appreciate Mr. Valli and his music. I would order this one for sentimental reasons. I had a tape of it for years then it died. This goes along with the Jer=sy Boys very nicely.
5,Frankie Valli Greatest Hits Vol. 1,This is a great CD! Loved it so much I had to buy Vol 2. You can listen toall the songs before you purchase and they are fantastic. I'd highlyrecommend this to anyone who loves these songs.
1,Bad Santa -- Bad Movie,"One of the worst, most putrid films I have ever seen. Two minutes into the movie, Santa is vomiting in the alleyway.And that is one of the high points -- it goes downhill from there.Mean-spirited and not even close to being funny.Bad humor. Bad script. Bad comedy. Bad breath.Save your time and your money....Can I give it .01 stars??"
1,The Worst Movie I have EVER Seen,"Please do NOT go to see this movie. Normally a little dark humor is very appealing to me and foul language can be pretty funny, but this movie had absolutely no humor and no plot. I was very surprised to see decent actors like John Ritter (RIP) and Bernie Mac in this movie, it should be a total embarassment to them and their families! I know this movie was horrible because I kept thinking the whole time that I would rather be watching Charlie's Angels Full Throttle, now that's bad folks. Spare yourself the agony or just cancel Christmas and kick a reindeer before you go to see this one."
1,Socially irrelevant,"I am not particularly into Christmas myself, but this simply wasn't funny. Not funny at all. Sadly pathetic. And I wonder how much of it was acting? The language was totally unnecessary, the sex jokes ... vulgar; had I driven myself I would have left after 10 minutes. We've seen Billy Bob Thornton act -not here. And tragically this was John Ritter's last film. What a send off."
1,Extremely bad movie. Worst than BAD!,"I am sorry I wasted my life on this trash. This is absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Language is atrocious with senseless vulgarities. Almost every scene of this movie was filled with profanity which was totally overdone! Bad plot, bad acting, bad directing, bad script. I would absolutely not rent this movie again even if it is the last movie on the shelf or if offered to me for free. I have lost respect for Billy Bob. I cannot understand why he would ruin his career for a crappy movie like this."
4,Bad Santa (The Unrated Version and Director's Cut) [Blu-ray],Bad Santa (The Unrated Version and Director's Cut) [Blu-ray] (Purchased on 12/26/2007) Great Movie. Was glad to see that the Blu version include both film cuts. I gave it 4 stars for the simple matter of grain. Grain drives me nuts. I want to see a crystal clear movie Directors. They really should give a us two versions one with grain and the other grain free.
3,Great and funny film with terrible DVD,"As a film Bad Santa was so depraved and vile that you couldn't help but laugh by the end. Willie even becomes sort of an underdog that you root for by the final few scenes.The DVD however is terrible. I can't really see much of any difference between the theatrical release and this apparent ""unrated version"". The extras on the DVD are few and far between as well. No commentary, a short gag reel, and a short outtake reel (which uses roughly 80% of the footage in the gag reel) a few extra scenes, and a 10 or 15 minute behind the scenes deal. Nothing to write home about at all. A Billy Bob and Tony Cox commentary would have been great. Hell anything would have been better than what we got here. The DVD just seems rushed and unfinished."
4,Loved this DVD!,"If you're a Billy Bob Thornton fan and you like dark humor then you will really enjoy this flick. In addition to his particular style of twisted humor Bernie Mac only adds to the fun. Did I mention that John Ritter was in this as well? And the short guy...don't remember his name but, believe me, Thornton's sidekick in the movie also does an amazingly funny job. Tuck the kids into bed before breaking this one out but definitely put it at the top of your ""must see"" list. You'll be glad you did.Badder Santa (Unrated Widescreen Edition)"
4,Crude but funny,"The Bottom Line:If you go into Bad Santa expecting well-written and acted low-brow humor, you'll likely be pleased by this very black comedy about unsympathetic but very amusing characters; it isn't warm and fuzzy, but it's all the better for it.3/4"
5,Very Funny.,I couldn't stop laughing at one of the things John Ritter says in the movie. Great Christmas movie. (very adult though)
3,Good Laughs... John Ritter is priceless,"This was pretty darn funny. Billy Bob Thornton is just plain sick and wrong in this. Not a big stretch? All the characters bring chuckles and snickers from all angles--( thank you Bernie Mac, and the immortal Cloris Leechman.)But I have to say John Ritter was the brilliant final ingredient that made this comedy. ""He's not gonna say F#*k stick in front of the children is he?!"" Not a huge part, but his little subtle lines and facial expressions were just hilarious. Great stuff from John, in his, I believe- final role?This is definitely worth checking out, and I have'nt even seen the un-rated version."
5,Bad Santa,"John Ritter, Bernie Mac and Billy Bob...do I need to say anything more. And of course the midget who steals the show."
4,great buy!,I am very pleased with my purchase. Price is great and I received my product in a few days instead of the anticipated couple of weeks - what a treat!
2,Bad Santa--Bad director's cut,"I should have read more reviews before I mistakenly bought the director's cut. This version is NOT the movie I enjoyed in the theater. The ending was changed and scenes were left out; for example the Advent calendar and the gym scene. These added more depth to the boy's character. Also the ending was disappointing different. So, if you enjoyed the theatrical release, do not buy the director's cut version."
5,Badder Santa,"This was much better than the original aired on TV! Once you watch it, you'll throw rocks at the original!"
2,Bad Bad Santa,Watch at your own risk! This may be the absolute worst Cristmas movie ever. Don't say you were not warned.
5,The Best of the Worst,"Willie T. Stokes isn't just a bad Santa, he's the worst - and a pitiful excuse for a human being, to boot. The first time I saw this movie it was on late night TV. It was like watching a train wreck between Christmas and a larcenous, foul-mouthed, urine-soaked wino. I watched it all the way to the end, mostly because I could not look away. Now every time I see it, it's more pathetic and hilarious than before.If Christmas is still visions of sugarplums dancing in your head, this movie is not for you. If, however, your view of the season has become a little jaded or cynical, or if you have even a slightly twisted sense of humor, this movie is a classic. Not only will you laugh your jingle bells off, you may even shed a tear when the world's most pathetic loser can find meaning in a season that can be more about getting than giving."
5,A Christmas tradition,"This movie has become a Christmas tradition with me since before it became ""Badder"". For years, I had three other couples come to my home for Christmas Eve dinner and then relaxed the rest of the evening by watching this movie. The laughs were often and out loud. Billy Bob was never better and with his foil, Tony Cox, becomes a wacky comedy team. Bernie Mac & John Ritter may be gone but will never be forgotten as a result of their lasting legacy for their superb performances in this film. The language may be too rough for some but that is why it is ""Badder""."
1,"Yuck, Yuck, Yuck (NOT yuk, yuk, yuk)","I tried to like it, truly I did. The critics all seem to have enjoyed it. But how many times can you listen to the word ""f*ck"" without getting annoyed? Apparently, I reached my limit about half way through this. There were some sweet moments, but Billy Bob Thornton is such a skank they were mostly lost on me. I give this movie a big thumbs down and a half star rating...half star because Cloris Leachman was good as always, but wasted in a very small part. Best part of the whole experience? The Spiderman 2 trailer."
2,Bad (Santa) Movie,Wonderful story idea.Brilliant casting. Billy Bob is perfect for Bad Santa.Terrible execution.What could have been a funny and ultimately heartwarming story is ruined by the ridiculous and gratuitious sex scenes and by the language.A kind of a South Park meets Miracle on 34 St.What could have been a wonderful movie in the right hands is merely OK.
1,Good idea... bad movie.,Billy Bob as a loathsome alcoholic santa clause is an awesome idea. The comedy is all dependent upon his violent outbreaks. This movie was more depressing than humorous.
1,Huh????,"This movie was probably looked better on paper than a movie. How it got green lit, I have no idea. The only redeeming value is the faith that Arthur has in Billy Bob Thornton and how he softens him. As for the jokes, there are some laughs, but most of them fall flat and have been seen a hundred times over in other movies(yawn). The comedy moments aren't clever and very predictable. I love black comedies since I was a teen, this one doesn't cut it. It was too oppresive. Tom C."
1,Vile and Repulsive,"How sick has this country gotten. This movie had a few good laughs, but at what price. Every 2 or 3 minutes has the word God d%$m or f*#k in it. Whats worse is that it is mostly around or directed towards kids. The producer or writers have stooped to a new low. People talk about pushing the envelope, but what they want to say is opening your wallets. This movie is proof that People will do anything for money.I dont know how much that fat kid was paid, but his parents should be given a ticket for allowing him to be in those foul language scenes. This is what this movie tells Americas youth: It's cool to say f#%k around everyone you know. Go ahead and say it, and while your at it, kick every guy you know in the balls.How sad."
1,Putrid,I enjoy black comedy movies but this one stinks to high hell. It didn't balance out the crudeness with enough funny moments. The movie was depressing. Billy Bob was miscast in the lead role. John Ritter gave some funny moments thats why I give the movie 1 star. Without John the movie gets zero stars
3,Hubby had to Have,"I guess if I was my hubby I would have given the movie 5 stars but I just couldn't, probably because it's one we definately have to hide from the kids. But hay it made him happy."
3,Overall good,"Good film. Could have been alot better though. The Chris Farley humor just got old after a while. Honestly, they could have toned down the swearing and graphic implied sex scenes and the film wouldn't have lost anything. A few moments of genuine clever humor, though. I don't know about you, but alcoholism isn't that funny, especially after you see Billy Bob drop the bottle on the ground for the fifth time or so. ALcoholism is serious stuff, it ruins lives and its hardly a joking matter. Fortunately......If you take this film as a black on black humor drama with a bit of heart-warming, off-beat poignancy that'll smack all the ""do-gooder"" conservative hypocrites in the face, its actually pretty good, but has alot of stupid scenes, which makes me give it only 3 stars.John Ritter is great in this film. Too bad he spent so many years doing goofy comedy like Three's Company. Also Bernie Mac is awesomely funny. The kid playing ""the kid"" is great too."
3,Get Bent Santa!,"This crude, often funny, but mostly crude comedy is not for the kiddies, even if it has Santa in the title. Just look at the word before it.Billy Bob Thornton breathes life into this really nasty character, Willy, a department store Santa who's a foul-mouthed, alcoholic turd. He's extremely sexually active. And a grinch who steals steals a different department store every season with a little person, his elf Marcus. Along with way he befriends with a chubby kid who seems to believe he's the real Santa Claus.Thornton gives a hilarious performance even though the script falls below par. The supporting players include Bernie Mac and the late John Ritter.It's still inexusable to defintly watch this film because it's way over the top and features thousands of bad words. Mostly the F word. The gags are funny sometimes, but that's it. I'll like the film better if I was dead drunk all the time like Willy."
5,HD version,"I watch Christmas movies once a year so this will be a great addition. Let's face it, White Christmas, A Christmas Carol, Santa Clause, Miracle on 34th Street are outstanding in their own way but Bad Santa is outrageous. Gotta have something off the wall to shake it up. The Blu Ray video is great, but I don't have the equipment to do a side by side comparison with a regular DVD. Is it the Blu Ray or my plasma big screen that makes the picture quality so good?"
4,"GREAT MOVIE, STUPID ENDING","I loved this movie until the end. Great humor, great situations, funny scenes. Nothing is sacred. I think my favorite is the scene where the store manager finds Santa shtupping a woman in the dressing room, and then he talks about it with the store detective. He imitates the sounds, and god that is hilarious. But the ending ruined it for me. (SPOILER ALERT) After the midget and his girlfriend kill the store detective, the story makes no sense. So it's a 4-star movie rather than 5."
3,movie review,"The hype of the movie was a bit much, it was a disapointment to watch and not very fun. I could have passed on this one and not missed a thing."
3,not for kids,This film is not for kids funny but should be for another time not Christmas and young children I would reconciler
1,Terrible Christmas Movie,"I should never have watched this movie I love Santa too much. But if you aren't into the magic of Santa and the Christmas spirit you may find this funny, I could see the humor. Bernie Mac is hilarious as always as is just about everyone in it, I just didn't like the whole premise."
3,Very Dark Movie.,Not very funny and way to dark for my taste. I did like seeing the Gilmore Girls mom in something other then the Gilmore Girls.
2,It tried. It really really tried.,"I have to say that while watching this movie I could see how it really tried to be a good movie. You could taste how bad it wanted to be with the big boys. It failed. Miserably. Instead of being a dark comedy about America's most abused holiday it became an experiment in actor reliance. John Ritter pulled off a Class A straight man to Mac's well played obscene humor. Thorton played drunk, disgusting, and self-loathing better than I've seen in a long time. Even the poor fat, booger-dripping kid was well portrayed. The problem lye in the fact that none of these elements fit together in any cohesive fashion. Then to end everything was all happy. Sure Thorton got it in the end, but he learned his lesson and made nicey nice with everyone. Come on people, if you are going to make it dark, Keep it dark."
2,Bad(der) Santa can't live up to his name.,"The problem with Bad Santa and its Bad(der) form is that Santa isn't nearly as bad as the marketing would have you believe. Bad Santa is bad because he robs department stores after casing them as Santa, all of which are shown to be managed by inept, balding men (implying, of course, that they therefore deserve to be robbed and hence, Bad Santa's just getting there first). Oh, he drinks and swears and likes women, but he's a puppy dog compared to most ne'er-do-wells in films and literature. He's the bad boy with a heart of gold and if it sounds pretty cliché, that's because it is. No surprises here. Bernie Mac and Lauren Graham are under-written and under-utilized, though they could hardly have improved this film."
1,Save your money,"This is a truly lousy movie.There no redeeming value to it.I'm not going to bother to tell you the story, it sucks.I'm sorry to see a really funny guy, Berny Mac in the terrible film."
1,don't waste your time!!!! Unless you like DARK COMEDIES!!!,"1st of all I rented this movie as it was supposed to be this hysterical comedy. This movie appeals only to people who like DARK COMEDIES. I chuckled about 4x during the movie. It was so depressing, boring, stupid, and just plain unfunny. And even though I like crude humor, the jokes weren't that funny. What a disapointment! Bernie Mac plays a straight man, so if you like his humor you'll be dissapointed yet again w/ this movie. If you like movies like Brazil, After hours, and war of the roses, you probably will like it, but if you want a sidespiltting, well written funny movie this one COMPLETLY misses the mark. Don't waste your time with this movie like I did!!!! I wish I could give it no stars!!!! but 1 is the least you can give it."
5,Lighten up people - this movie is GREAT!,"I just rented this movie & intend to buy it.It is well worth seeing if you like to laugh!However, I wouldn't let childrenwatch it."
2,STAY AWAY FROM DIRECTORS CUT,"If you are a fan of Bad Santa, DO NOT BUY THIS DVD. I bought it expecting extended and restored scenes, instead I got a totally different ending and hilarious scenes cut out.This version ends with the little boy outside trying to clean up the blood on his front steps rather than giving the bully a swift kick in the nards.One of the scenes cut out is the scene in the gym where Willie and Marcus are trying to teach the little boy how to defend himself. That was one of the funniest scenes in the movie.The packaging is deceptive. If they had said, ""new ending"" on the notes, I would have left it alone. It didn't and I wasted my money. I thought I would come on here and post a warning."
5,Maybe the funniest movie I have EVER seen!,"This movie is DARK, DARK, DARK, but HILARIOUS!It's sooo bad, leave the kiddies at home and just enjoy what is destined to become one of the greatest cult classics ever. I was rolling in the aisles with laughter and so was the rest of the audience. I have never been in a theatre where more people were laughing out loud. If you can enjoy REALLY dark humor, you'll love this. Be forewarned, nothing is off-limits in this one. So if you're politically correct in ANY way, you'll be offended. But if you can take a joke, PLEASE see this movie!I can't help but think the negative reveiwers I've seen here just don't get it, lighten UP and just revel in the comedic value of how bad people can be!This movie will instantly be added to my collection when it comes out on DVD."
2,Bad Bad Santa,"A friend of ours, Guy Gilbert, recommended this film as the ""funniest I have ever seen""... it wasn't. There are good moments but not many. My suggestion to Guy was to watch 'Sean of the Dead' and come back to me..."
5,I'M ON MY F***IN LUCHBREAK!!!!!!!!,Santa drinks. Santa swears. Santa steals.this is by far the bestr christmas film i own. if u havent seen this yet get it u dont know what ur missing!!!
4,So bad it's good,"This movie will not be in the finalists for movie of the year but I'll bet it will be remembered when others are forgotten...filthy language adnausium but cute and lots of irreverant laughs...if you ae easy to offend, don't go but if you just enjoy a nasty joke, this is for you...Billy Bob, although a political joke, is a fine actor..."
1,bad product and poor service,"the dvd did not work. i attempted to contact the seller, pbshop, several times to find out how i can return this item but have not received a response. I am completely dissatisfied with the product and with the level of serice"
2,Approximately one laugh for every ten attempts at humor,"Sadly, this film is not nearly as smart or funny as it could have been. There are a few moments of fun, but it's mainly just vulgar, with most of the humor based on Santa cussing his head off at anyone crazy enough to try to talk to him. The first couple of times it's a bit amusing. After that, it's just tedious. The bartender with the Santa fetish is much the same. The first time they are shown having sex & she's crying out, ""F*** me, Santa!!"" over & over, it's a little funny. The second time, it's just sad."
1,Sick and depraved,I don't mind sick and depraved if it is funny. Bad Santa was anything but funny. Too bad this was John Ritter's final film. He deserved to go out on a higher note. I think he was the only actor who realized they were making a comedy.
3,Well...,"I found it a little crude, but it cracked my husband up. Does have a message to it, which made it watchable. Billy Bob's movies are always a little weird."
4,Satan Clause.,"If you find you've had your fill of eggnog, holiday cheer, and Christmas in general, this is your film. Billy Bob Thornton plays a drunk, cursing, sex-crazed mall-Santa that shatters all previous images of the guy in red, and his elf (little person) side-kick brings a ton of rude humor. I believe I heard the F-word was used in the movie 147 times, hence this is not for the kiddies. While this is indeed a comedy, it has a few dull spots, and could be disturbing to some. However, it does also have a small heart, and the parts I laughed at, I really laughed at. The scene where everybody gets hit in the groin had me crying. In short, if you need a break from all the Rudolph and Frosty, get ""Bad Santa""."
4,"Naughty, but fun!","Stayed up Christmas Eve with adult family members and found so many laughs in this movie, even though we'd seen it before and knew what was coming. An oldie, but goodie."
3,fun times,"we wanted something dark to counter the christmas story. and oh my goodness we got it. lags a little bit at times, but overall a really fun movie!"
1,Wasted an hour and a half of my life with this nonsense.,"I appreciate raunchy humor, politically incorrect humor even more. But Bad Santa stoops you down to the most immature and ill scripted humor ever. I dont get what was so funny about this. The jokes were a drag and the acting was amateur. I sat watching this and prayed for the funniest part to come (because of all the hype) and before I knew it, the movie was over. I had to slap myself a number of times for wasting my time. The positive reviews are probably given by early teenagers or college kids who didnt watch the movie sober."
1,Misleading,"I ordered ""Bad Santa"", my order says ""Bad Santa"", my order form sent to me says ""Bad Santa"" the DVD that was sent to me...Badder Santa - the tiny picture shows this, but the name, the description and order all show what I wanted, not what I got."
3,You saying there's a problem with my gear?,"This is a hilarious holiday movie. Definetely not for little kids, thus the reason it is unrated. Billy Bob thorton does a great job in this movie, as well as the midget. I just got this on DVD today and the special features are pretty good as well. Well worth the $25.00 that i paid for it."
4,Didn't know whether to laugh or cry,"This is truly a dark comedy. You can't help but to feel bad for Billy Bob Thortons character. He drinks too much and seems to hate his life. His elf partner Marcus curses him and tells him he is worthless at every turn and in turn Billy Bob curses and talks mean to the kids he interacts with. I admit the film was funny, but it also had quite a dramatic element, which puts it in the dark comedy category for me. The poor little boy in this movie even had a sad sad life. This move was very interesting and I enjoyed watching it. It is a nice movie to watch when you have some free time."
4,FEARLESSLY BAWDY BUT FUNNY,"Bad Santa has many crass gags, it almost drags you into a dark alley of tasteless humour and thrashes you up. Imagine Billy Bob Thorton in a comic lead role, tough to visualize. But the man is bloody hilarious! Some parts are better scripted than others, but for a film that's so determined NOT to have a heart, it does surprise you with one. A wonderfully perverse treat that goes by in a flash, so it can't be all that bad any way. Recommended!"
5,"continous laughs, perfect for Billy Bob Thornton fans",Pretty raunchy but if that doesn't bother you then it will be one of the funniest movies you've ever seen.
1,EXTREMELY OFFENSIVE,"I went to see this movie with a friend. We were both very disgusted by it. Granted, I know that it is almost impossible to see a movie these days in which the actors do not use obscenities. However, this movie shows zero creativity and one hundred percent vulgarity. In particular, I was very offended by the overuse of profanity, especially that aimed at the Christian faith. If I had known that the writers of this movie were anti-Christian, I would not have gone to see it. I'm glad that we didn't have to pay to see it and that none of our students went to see it; our university gave us free tickets."
2,"Average,but a trip","Billy Bob Thorton is a trip as is the Late John Ritter in this film.it has me laughing in places,but after a while it gets predictable.the vibe of the movie didn't bother me,&the pacing was cool,but things got figured out rather quickly.it's a trip out film though.alots of laughs&twists."
2,One Joke Movie.,"Original premise with lots of funny potential, but the screenwriters dropped the ball in a big way, relying on ""one joke"" instead of developing a compelling story with characters that matter. In other words, they figured a foulmouthed, drunk Santa with urinary incontinence who hates children, has sex with women that have Santa fetishes and also happens to be a thief was enough to fill two hours of film time. Nope. When you see Santa drunk and vomiting in an alley the first time, it's so jarring and unusual that, yes, it's (kind of) funny, but after two hours of the same joke with selfish, mean-spirited characters you don't like? Time to walk out of the theatre and sneak into another, funnier movie."
5,F***'* Hilarious!!!,"First off, if foul language bothers you, then this movie isn't for you. Also, it's definitely not for kids.But, this movie is absolutely hilarious! It's definitely one of the funniest movies that I've seen in a long time."
5,"Hilarious alternative to the ""Christmas"" movie","I wish my fellow reviewers would stop complaining about one note funny, boring, etc. If you want high Shakespearean comedy, don't rent or buy something called ""Bad Santa."" This is a cussing, drinking, fooling around, no holds barred funny and sarcastic movie for the cynic in all of us -- and it's not even that cynical by the end, although Bill Bob Thornton's character still keeps his swearin' ways (which is refreshing). The young actor playing the lonesome kid who starts Bad Santa connecting a little with his heart is adorable and a great performer. Everyone who's supposed to be funny is very funny. When the holidays roll around, I'm going to be watching this movie and ""A Christmas Story."" 5 stars to this and relax, people, enjoy it."
2,Not very funny at all,"Don't get me wrong, I'm a 14 year old kid, And I don't care at all about swearing. It didn't offend me for a second. It's just that this movie isn't that funny. I think the fat kid was the movies saving grace. He was a good actor, and watching Willie beat the $#!^ out of the ids who gave him a black eye is both hysterical, yet sickeningly, heartwarming. I nearly cried watching Willie crawl towards the fat kids house, clutching a pink elephant ( what the kid wanted) after being shot 3 times. It was just so incredible, to watch such a disgusting excuse for humanity use his last seeds of life, just to make a kid happy. I smiled when the kid but dumbassery behind him, and kicked that S.O.B. in the nuts.Other than this, (...)the film is garbage."
1,Santa Claus just got drunk and boring,"Cursing, Sex, Drugs, Drinking... It has it all. But that doesn't make a movie good. What makes a comedy good is all those things but put into a clever script with good actors and a good director.All the funny parts weren't that funny. So the guy gets kicked in the balls. Ha? So the guy says f*** to little kids Ha? Ha? Every joke must have gotten repeated atleast twice and they weren't funny the first time.If you think this movie is funny you obviously haven't seen Old School, Zoolander, Wayne's World, Team America: World Police, The Girl Next Door, and Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle. All those comedies are much better than this dumb waste of time."
1,BAD IS ONLY ONE WAY TO DESCRIBE THIS FLICK!,"Lousy, poor, nauseating, terrible, pathetic, garbage, crap, awful, bomb, deplorable, junk, offensive, reprehensible, rotten, vile, appalling, dreadful, rubbish, belligerent, revolting, loathsome, horrible, disgraceful, inferior, pitiful, shoddy, worthless, trash, loser, grotesque, macabre, weak, hideous, bogus, the pits, foul, repulsive, lame, ghastly, waste of time, bummer, sickening, atrocious, horrendous, shameful and disgusting.In other words, I didn't care for this film. I would say, that it definitely sucked!"
1,Resounding BOOOOO,"This movie stinks. I mean it really stinks. The first time I saw it, the first time I heard the advertising for this, I knew it stunk. And guess what- it really really does stink. It's not family friendly nor is it charming. It doesn't seem to know what audience it's going for.BOOOO this is about as retarded as The Grinch or that dumb Ernest At Christmas movie (You know, that guy who always ""hey Vern"" sigh so lame). Super lame."
5,classic,i loved this movie from the opeening frame to the closing credits. it isn't oscar material but i think it rocks and it's totally hilarious. raucous comedy.
5,"Coen Brothers at their best, assist by Billy Bob","Only a few filmmakers could get this made. In the vein of Something About Mary this movie goes for every gross joke with a drunken, gross Santa who closes every year with a big theft. Billy Bob and the black dwarf deadpan their way through the movie and it's hilarious! Nothing is sacred so any prudish or conservative Christians should steer clear. Eventually the movie manages to find some good even in Billy Bob. But that's just a close. This is a movie about comedy. And it IS FUNNY! A must see for comedy fans."
5,"Vulgar,Foul, Rude and Wonderful","Billy Bob Thorton is absolutely fantastic in this role. He has brilliantly portrayed a man who has hit bottom and kept falling. Every other word out of his mouth is an expletive. If there was any real justice in the world, he would have been nominated for an academy award. One can honestly state that this film is spectacularly and universally offensive. I loved every minute. I have rarely laughed so much and so hard at any other comedy.But what redeems this film is Thorton's character's struggle with his deeply suppressed feelings of compassion and the desire to behave honorably. That, combined with the brilliant performances by Bernie Williams ( a personal favorite ) the late, and much lamented John Ritter, the lovely Lauren Graham, Tony Cox and the always hilarious Cloris Leachman, make this film a real gem.Still, let there be no misunderstanding, this is an adult comedy. If you don't find that off putting, buy this DVD, and enjoy!"
2,Disappointing,"I ordered this version after reading reviews of it and Badder Santa, thinking maybe I was getting something more than the movie I'd already seen and loved. I didn't care for this version. It is lacking a couple of scenes that I think help to tie the story together, and in apparently seeking a more ""noir"" theme includes scenes that are probably more than I needed to know...like the van backing over the security guy. They killed him, okay, I get it. I also didn't like the ending as much (although I won't give it away for those of you just dying to see it). I will donate this to the Friends of the Library sale and buy myself a copy of the ""vanilla"" version."
1,horrible,"horrible movie. Maybe it was funny when it first came out, but there is nothing funny or interesting about this film"
2,Disappointed,"This movie, although mildly funny in spots, is a disappointment. I love dark humor, but this movie is vulgar without the wit or edge of a Coen brother's movie. After seeing this film, I felt like I needed a shower. It just misses the mark."
1,AWFUL,"I'm all for crude humor and foul language, but this movie was awful. I didn't even finish it. Don't waste your time!"
4,The Epitome of Being Bad,"My sister told me this movie was bad. I thought she meant bad-- as in a not that good movie. She was right. It's bad, but it's a good kind of bad.Billy Bob Thornton stars the worst Santa of all time. He curses at kids, drinks and gets laid on the job, and is too skinny to be a Santa. He and his ""elf"" have been working together for seven years, each year hitting a different mall to rob from at Christmas. Then one year he meets a girl, meets a strange kid, and begins to see the light... though according to movie standards, his light is very dim!This is definitely a funny movie. It's an unconventional sort of funny but it works amazingly well. If cursing bothers you, please avoid, but otherwise check this movie out. You're sure to have a great time watching the antics of the worlds worst Santa"
5,GREAT MOVIES!!!! VERY FUNNY!!!!,"WONDERFUL MOVIES! That's why i gave 5 stars. Ready to see the Badder Santa, now and Elf is just a great all around movie, for everyone!!"
2,Terrible quality of the DVD,"While the story itself was funny, the quality of the DVD is terrible. it stops and is very grainy. I will be very cautious to buy DVD's in the future."
4,funny,Always nice to watch at Xmas! I dont recommend it with kids tho...Billy Bob does a great job as Santa
2,"Odd... and not funny in any way, shape or form...","I bought this movie on a whim for $5... I wish I had saved the money! While I wasn't sure I'd like a Santa who was drunk and unpleasant (I knew enough about the movie to know that) I had high hopes that the performances by Billy Bob Thornton and Bernie Mac would be interesting at least... since I like them as actors usually. Not so. I thought the humor would be funny in a dark way. Not so. It was just disapointing all around, mainly because of a bad script (which have characters who are all weird, and not a funny weird)... and oddly unpleasant, because of all the profanity and Santa screwing around (DEFINITELY NOT a film to show with small kids present). Felt bad that this was one (or the last one) of John Ritter's last performances before his untimely death."
3,***1/2 Bad Santa is funny for a while.,"Bad Santa is a film that is very funny for a while, and then slides into conventional movie territory, which is bad for a film as different as this. Billy Bob Thornton is great as a drunk loser who only works during the holiday season as a mall Santa Claus, accompanied by his trusty elf, portrayed very well by Tony Cox. These two work very well together and their scenes in the first half of this film are very funny. The rest of the cast seems wasted, outside of the little boy, who gets some funny scenes. Thornton is a riot in the scenes at the mall, but when the movie attempts to grow a heart, it stumbles into a cliche driven film about Christmas and it doesn't fit. A good effort, but not not as good as it could have been."
2,Bad Santa... Bad Movie,"I really liked Billy Bob Thornton in Simple Plan and Sling Blade but I find him somewhat annoying is this film. Outside of some good performances by Bernie Mac and John Ritter in small parts and the scene stealing Tony Cox as Marcus the bad little Elf, there is little to like about this film."
3,Watch your packaging.,"Great tape at a low price. Unfortunately, It arrived smashed and .had to be fixed with Krazy Glue."
1,"Poor movie, weak story - waste of time.",I guess it is hard to come up with a good plot these days. So a story about bad Santa and a litle guy working every December just to rob a mall at the end looks like an original concept. Perhaps this could work out to be a nice comedy but the flood of cruelty and vulgarisms makes this a bad movie in my opinion. It is not saved by the performance of BB Thornton and Bernie Mac. The female character Lauren Graham seems nicest but is is not enough to spend 90 minutes watching this movie.
1,Bad Santa - Two Thumbs Down,This is an awful and stupid movie. Totally trash. It has so much bad vile language from beginning to end and in front of small children which is unforgiveable. The movie has no plot or story line to it.Do not waste your money or time on this garbage. TWO THUMBS DOWN!!
1,Bad Santa & Bad movie,"I am so disappointed, buying this DVD partly based on reviews here at amazon. Bad/thin plot, no sex/situations, and a sick sick degrading humor. One of the rare movies, where I all the time wanted to throw it in the bin, but had to watch, because it could not be true it was so bad - remembering all the thumbs up reviews I had read. But to no good, in the bin it went. Really have to be careful about reviews in the future..."
3,it was ok,"some good laughs, but some slow spots too, maybe i just watched it at the wrong time of the year, dont watch this in June!"
1,I couldn't make it through this pile of reindeer doodoo.,"I don't quit mid-way through many movies, but this was truly awful. The marketing people had to do something with it, so it was sold as a comedy. Don't believe it! It is vile and nasty, which might have been OK if it was funny--darkly funny, crudely funny, any funny! I was hoping for something along the lines of the creatively and crassly funny ""Shakes the Clown"" of many years ago. (The ""Citizen Kane"" of alcoholic clown movies.) Buy that instead if you actually want to laugh."
2,I must be awful ....,"because this movie didn't seem so BAD to me. Sure they use the F-word every second, yeah there is some violence, incontinence, alcohol abuse, sex ... blah, blah, blah, but it isn't offensive in that wickedly funny way. In fact, it seems geared toward a young audience that finds those things shocking and funny. Here they do it beacause they seem to think it is funny, but it ain't! Not shocking, not funny - just there. And at it's core, it still has the redemption of the main character at Christmas through the eyes of a little boy. Whatever."
1,d-fs601 shuts off all by itself even the radio,"I would not recommend this cd player to anyone. Towards the end of the 90 day warranty the player began to turn itself off, all by itself when jogging. This happens with the cd player or the radio. The Sony product support was no help. They suggested the anti-skip setting should be changed but how does that effect the radio? They finally agreed to look at it if I sent it to them at my cost. The next day I could not reproduce the problem. However, every 2-3 months the problem returns for a few days and then stops. I have had other much less expensive players from other manufacturers that performed much better. Also, the buttons to adjust the tuner are very difficult to use while jogging."
1,This thing stinks!,"First off, it's big, heavy and ugly. It costs too much. The tuner sux, yes it's got presets galore but it only has 3 buttons to save your favorite stations and its hard as hell to figure out how to save your favorite stations on em. The tv tuner only catches up to 4 channels (if your lucky) and they don't sound good. the weather tuner didn't even work when i tried it. the sound on this thing isn't that good either. this thing is too much money and isn't worth it at all. you can find cd players with fm/am tuner cheaper and even nicer."
3,Skips when I run,"This player works fine if you don't subject it to much of a bounce. Even with the Case Logic neoprene CD player belt, it skipped when I ran with it. I set the player to the skip-resistant mode, but it didn't make a lot of difference. As far as the method the manufacturer recommends, strapping it in the palm of your hand, that might work as far as skipping goes, but no thanks. I run on trails, etc., and I would not want to take a tumble with a CD player strapped to my hand. No problems with walking, but if you're buying it to run with, I wouldn't recommend it."
1,BAD QUALITY,"I love the Murder She Wrote program. I have been a fan sense it started. HOWEVER I am appalled at the quality of the DVD's. I have purchased 3 each of the season 5, 6, and now 12. There are white blips, and dust like particle marks throughout them, and looks like the Universal Studios never bothered to ""clean"" them up before mass producing, and dubbing them for consumers like us. They put a large price on them and give us inferior product. It is a shame, as this program is a wonderful one, attested by the fact it lasted 12 seasons, not an easy task."
2,A lot of repeats,Most of the episodes are repeats from other seasons. They should not have priced this last episode as high as the others and/or informed the fans/customers about the fact that it was a rerun of other seasons. This is very disappointing. It seems that they were just out to make money.
2,Boring,"It was obvious that Angela was in it for the money. I kept thinking that some of the episodes were in other Murder, She Wrote sets. Frankly, it was a waste of money and time."
5,"ANGELA LANSBURY: NO ONE COULD HAVE PLAYED ""JESSICA FLETCHER"" BETTER","I AM SO HAPPY THAT FINALLY I CAN COMPLETE MY ""MURDER SHE WROTE"" COLLECTION. ABSOLUTELY NO ONE COULD HAVE DONE A BETTER JOB. I ENJOYED THIS SHOW, THOUGH I DIDN'T SEE MANY OF THE EPISODES UNTIL THE NINETIES ROLLED IN. BUT THEY WERE AND STILL ARE FUN TO WATCH. I HAVE ONLY PURCHASED FOUR SEASONS. BUT I WILL DEFINITELY HAVE THE TWELTH SEASON BEFORE TO LONG. I DID NOT BEGIN PURCHASING MINE IN ORDER. I STARTED WITH SEASON SIX,SEVEN AND EIGHT. WHAT CAN I SAY! SIX, SEVEN, AND EIGHT WERE ON SALE. SINCE I HAD NOT SEEN SEASON ONE, I CONVINCED MY SON TO BUY IT FOR A BIRTHDAY PRESENT AND I LOVED IT. OH, I AM SO LOOKING FORWARD TO BUYING EVERYTHING FROM TWO TO FIVE. THEN FROM NINE TO TWELVE. I'M NOT SURE IF I LIKE ""JESSICA"" MOVING FROM ""CABOT COVE"". I'LL HAVE TO WATCH MORE OF THE LATER EPISODES. I'M JUST HAPPY THAT UNLIKE SERIES PRODUCED BY ""AARON SPELLING"" WE CAN STILL PURCHASE OTHER SERIES THAT WE STILL LOVE TO WATCH."
5,Love the 12th season,I am a big fan of Murder she wrote and this season is great. Would recommend season 12 for all Murder she wrote fans.
4,"Not the greatest joystick now, yet may be a long lasting one","frankly speaking, this stick is of some dissapointment after I returned the logitech xtreme 3d (also $30) and bought it. The maneuvers i could do with the logitech in Battlefield 2 are no longer possible, esp. when i tried to line up with and kill an Ground-to-air missle operator, which is a tiny little spot on the ground. it is NOT as precise as the logitech counterpart. However, the problem with logitech was after 10 days of use, it completely lost calibration in one axis and my j-10 was barrel-rolling in the sky automatically, until I uninstalled the factory driver and re-calibrate the stick with windows xp embedded calibration function.So, to protect my limited investment on game controllers, i chose to believe what other reviewers said and stay with the Thrustmaster."
4,Joystick,"The wide, heavy base makes it absolutely tip-proof. It has excellent response on the basic controls. The only negative was with the Thrustmapper software (to program the extra buttons). It caused all kinds of funky behaviour on my PC, so I removed it. With games like BF 1942, you can map all the commands in the game anyway. Good device, software womps."
2,beware of early reviews,"It worked well out of the box, but after a month or two, it started behaving erratically, especially in the twist axis. Now I experience drift and position spikes even after I calibrate. Maybe I just got a lemon, but I doubt it."
4,Vimmii N.,"Received ordered item within a week but it was broken. I could tell by hearing pieces moving inside the joystick.I had to open it and found out that one of the 2 holders that keeps some metal plates in place was broken. Anyway, I took all the plates out so I didn't have to deal with all the noise. Joystick is OK now. My newphew is using it very much daily and he's happy with it. I'm still wonder why those plates are there but I'm sure there must be a reason. Well it would have been 5 stars if it were not broken."
1,This is an extremely unreliable watch!,"I bought this watch 2 years ago and have had nothing but trouble with it. Since I purchased it, it has steadily lost approximately 2 minutes/day even though I never take it off. Additionally, it is extremely difficult to set the date correctly. The worst, however, began about 1 month ago when it started to lose time and can easily end up 2-3 hours slow by the end of the day ... not a great thing when you need to pick up children at a bus stop. If you need a watch you can count on, this is not the watch for you!"
5,perfect,"I love this watch, it's perfect. I wear alot of jeans and the blue just adds the perfect pop. It really looks classy :)"
1,"This watch never ran, no one wanted to work on it either.","I recieved this beautiful watch and was thrilled. It would never start, even when I called the company and they walked me through the process, again. Nothing. Beautiful piece of metal... too bad."
1,Junk,I purchased this watch for my Daughter's Christmas present and it is junk. She tries to wear it but it will not keep time even when hand wound. Recently we've discovered that the second hand will spins freely around the dial. I will NEVER purchase another Invicta product again.
3,Invicta Automatic Pro Divers Watch,"This is a nice watch, but it's not very accurate...looses about 3 sec/day. Also, a customer would need to shake the watch before bedtime. It looses about 1/2 an hour overnight without arm moovement. Buyer Beware of this problem! It does have a screw down crown for heavy diving use."
3,Uh oh,"I got this camera new and within the first day of use an issue came up. The mechanism to cover/uncover the lens was faulty. When I turn the camera the lens come out but remains covered. Sometimes it just opens halfway. I don't know if other owners have experienced the same problems, but considering how delicate is this mechanism, I imagine is a problem with the model in general. The area around the lens scratches easily, so consider it a warning if you're going to put this camera in your pocket. I wouldn't blame you because it's the perfect pocket size, but it's also a pricey camera. I'm not crazy about picture quality but could be because I have a far superior digital SLR. There's some (barely noticeable) distortion in the images which I attribute to lens size."
1,wish I had not bought it,"I bought this camera with full faith in Leica products despite the high price tagFive months after light use (about 300 photos in all), the camera was not working.Leica repaired but refused to replace bad product with same or equivalent model.Customer service was completely insensitive to my troubles with their product and myrequest for replacing it. If I have problems with it again, I will have to pay for repairs sincethe warranty expires soon. For professional photography Leica may be worth the investment.For non-professional, social use, Leica is a waste of money. My friends are happy with their$100 equipment while I am stuck with a lemon."
3,Entertaining,"My 4 year old wanted this after playing with her cousins. Probably a minor defect, just need to work it a bit, but the mouse sticks on occasion which causes a bit of frustration, but plenty of other features to do with keyboard. Great for taking along in the car."
2,Laughtop not funny,"My two and a half year old son received this as a christmas present. He went to sleep with it everynight. He loved it. How ever he was unable to use the mouse's poor function and found it difficult to play the games. So he left it on the top ABC tap all the time. He has had it almost 2 months and half the letter don't work and the slide bar on the side quit changing the function. The lower case, upper case function is better for older kids. Bottom line, it may be great for 4 year olds but not my almost 3. It wasn't abused it was a bedtime toy. But it still didn't hold up well. I'm going to break my son's heart taking it away but he needs a toy that has all the ABC's not just half of them."
3,Jessa's Mom in Oregon,"Great concept....and at first my 3 year old used it a lot. She was able to work on her laptop while I worked on mine. But, we quickly realized that the mouse was not working properly (after the box had been thrown away). The LCD screen is a little on the small side too. If it were me, I would wait and purchase another brand or wait until this one was perfected a little better."
4,Amazing Results,"I bought this toy for my 3 year old son to boost his letter recognition. He already knew the alphabet (or at least the song), but I had not tried teaching him letter recognition yet. My nephew had this laughtop, so my son has been asking for it for months. I finally bought it for him. Within a couple of days of using it, he recognized several letters (with absolutely no help from me). Within a week or two (which is how long I've had it), he knows pretty much all the letters (most upper and lower case, but struggles w/ some lower case), can tell you what word starts with each letter (or most letters) and can spell his name (which is only 4 letters). He loves the toy and takes it with us wherever we go. If he never touches it again, for him to have learned as much as he has now (with no help from me). I just gave him the ""computer"" and left him alone. My husband and I are amazed!"
4,fisher-price fun 2 learn laughtop,"We purchased this for our daughter's fourth birthday. She spends hours on it learning her letters and phonics. It has been very durable, so far. Our 10 month old has gotten a hold of it several times. I think it is a great pre-school age toy. She can be on her laptop now while I am on mine."
4,Nice toy computer,Very good toy computer. Easy to use. Definitely a toy computer that will grow with a young child. My daughter is 3 and uses some of the features. She should be more comfortable with the rest as she gets older. It's lightweight and portable and great to take in the car.
3,Hard to move the mouse???,This is a great toy for little toddlers. My complaint is that when you are playing where it asks you to move the mouse it sometimes doesn't know what you did.The good news is it has 9 levels. I highly recommend it!
4,Great little laptop,"My son loves to carry this around ""like mom and dad"". He is just over 2 years, so the toy may be a bit too old for him. He hasn't figured out the stationary mouse, or the different games and functions, but loves to put it on his lap and push buttons. I'm sure he will grow into it. Screen is real basic big diode black and white LCD, so don't expect any graphics or video type items, real basic stuff, but OK for young ones. Case is durable...seems to be able to withstand drops."
4,"educational, durable, fun","Four games: it speaks the letter and gives an example when you press a key; it shows you a letter and you have to press the corresponding key; it plays a tune or a tone when you press a key; and you use the mouse to play Pong. Our boy is almost two, and he as learned his letters already, in part because of the first two games. He doesn't understand the mouse, or the idea of playing a tune by sequentially playing different tones; so we are hoping this toy will have some staying power as he continues to figure out those pieces. The toy has survived being dropped, or the top being opened too wide, with no problems."
4,Great but wish it had numbers,"I bought this for my son when he was around 18 months. He quickly learned his alphabet (reading & recognizing the letters). It was fantastic! He loved the phonics game where you have to type the raining letters...He had so much fun and learned FAST! I just wish they had numbers and a ""it's raining numbers game"". My 2 yr old can read the alphabet and all the sounds but has no fun way of learning his numbers. Over all a fantastic and fun learning toy"
4,age range wrong!,"ok, this is a really great and cute learning toy, but the age recommendation says 3-7yr old. It is wayyyyy more appropiate for the 18 mo. to 3yr old. most 4 yr olds already know the alphabet and letter sounds, and a 7 yr old would definitely find it boring and babyish!"
2,the worst movie I saw this year,"Despite the great cast, this film fails to make sense on any level. I suppose if that is the definition of ""indy"" then, yes, this is a great indy film, completely full of itself, so full that the actors are directed to stare blankly at the camera at times and just let the viewer try to figure out what is going on. Ultimately it does become clear that the film has a lot to do with pedophilia (a great actor - Cieran Hinds - given almost nothing to do except THINK about his past actions) and dysfunction (what a waste of Ally Sheedy's talent to give her a cameo as a deranged narcissist and then forget about her). It was a waste of time, money, and most especially talent. I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because the actors kept me believing that it would get better."
2,"Three out of five berets, ZZZzzzzzzzzz.......","Spare me.Pretentious, art-house nonsense like this has to be made I guess, for some reason; but does it have to be THIS boring??I rented this ode to sleeping pills because someone I trusted recommended it. Now he is going on my ""suspect critic"" list. Egads! One boring story full of weirdos after another, full of scenes that go nowhere. ""Weird"" does not always equal ""good"". The whole mess left me cold.Yep, I don't ""get it"", thank goodness. If I ever do, hopefully I will still have enough sense to lock myself up in the nearest loony bin.."
5,Science and Fun!,"My kids 2 & 4 like this leap book. We are not especially JayJay fans, but I was really pleased with the content of this book. It has some really neat stuff to learn about in it...not just the ABC's and 123's. Its content includes many science themes like Animals,Dinosaurs, Planets and Solar system, Landforms, Seasons and weather, as well as simply learning what goes on in the Day and Nightime or what to wear for different weather. The main story focuses on a butterfly named Breezy that is flying south. I was pleased with the different content that it provided, it was a nice change from the typical abc's. You don't have to be a JayJay fan to enjoy this one, but Science is the main theme here so if you are looking for abc's and 123's...you wont find that. I gave it 4 stars for durability simply because its paper, and it can get worn."
3,Did not receive what was pictured,"It was hard to decide how many stars to give this. I ordered what you see, I did not get that. What I got was a slightly different version (different brand) that I specifically did NOT order because it got bad reviews. I have to give the seller credit though, for reimbursing me. The product I did get (Dynarex brand) was actually mislabeled. Unless the seller had ever opened a package, even he could not have known that what was being sold as 8-ply pads were really only 4-ply. So it's actually impossible for me to rate the product shown. I give it 3 stars because what you see is not what you get. Would have given it 1 if the seller hadn't been so good about refunding my money (including shipping)."
3,Not quite a guide,"I bought this book and I expected to learn singing from Caruso, but I was surprised to find out that more than half the book is actually a biography about his life. The book's aim isn't to teach singing, but to tell about Caruso's life, his career, and finally about how he practiced singing. No solid advice or technique is offered."
4,About the book,"It is one of the best collection I have ever owned. Provides an indepth explanation about Caruso's vocal tenchnique and how he practices them. Exercise scales are even provided to guide you to the singer you wished to be. I have started the scales for practice and believe me when I say this - it's not easy - especially for starters. Overall, the book's great. The content is great - and no doubt about it, it was written by one of the many great authors/singers around."
4,Good story,"Enjoyed the story. Did become a wee bit weak at the end, but overall still worth reading. It would be better if someone has read the earlier novels in order to have the background information."
3,A Well Written Downer,"I just finished Losing Nelson. This is the first Barry Unsworth book I read, and now I can say that he is indeed a masterful writer and a subtle psychologist. Having said that, I have to admit that for me Losing Nelson is somewhat of a letdown. The historical part of the book, the one that deals with Admiral Nelson, is very interesting and now I know more about Nelson than I ever did before. However, the fictional part of the novel, which describes the main character's (Cleasby) descent into total madness, ends up being a very skillfully written but depressingly hopeless story -- a very dark tale, despite frequent flashes of ironic humor. Along the way, though, the reader encounters a couple of wonderfully sketched characters (for example, Miss Lily, a decent person with a backbone) as well as several beautifully written scenes."
3,A Book About Obsession,"In our celebrity-infatuated culture, this story is frighteningly appropriate. The reader is locked inside the mind of a man named Charles Cleasby who is obsessed with Horatio Nelson--believing him to be the greatest English hero--but who is slowly sinking into the realization that Nelson was far from the selfless, duty-bound public servant of popular mythology. As the obsessed do, Cleasby resists the knowledge that Nelson may have made some of his most important decisions based on political expediency or to aggrandize his own reputation.As other reviewers have pointed out, the ending is a let-down to an otherwise riveting psychological tale. There is a chance for the redemption of his character here that author Unsworth does not take, and which may have been more enlightening. Nevertheless, for those who have a knowledge of Nelson and his time, this book should be absorbing and entertaining."
1,A very dull book about a disturbed main character,A deranged principal character tries to recreate his life as a reincarnation of Admiral Lord Nelson.Full of wonderful historical detail and perhaps worth reading for that. But the principal character's derangement overtakes him when he finally discovers some of Nelson's seamier side. Very sad to feel his return to his deranged state.
4,Dark and disturbing,"This is a seriously grim and disturbing novel which is unrelenting in its descent to the inevitable.In my opinion there are no glimmers of hope, no redemption for the protagonist Charles Cleasby. The reader can do nothing but watch in horror at his Nelson Club humiliation, his gauche interaction with 'Miss Lily' and at the moment he finally realises the truth about his hero which leads ultimately to his final descent into complete madness.Despite all this if you can stomach the book it is well worth reading but I guarantee its content and especially the ending will stay with you for a long time."
4,And then I woke up,"Great development, unusual direction, fine detail, all marred by the ending. An excellent case study for a discussion group on whether a book's ending can render it unworthy of being read from the outset. I would vote no; it is still worth reading."
5,A Haunting Portrait,"""Loosing Nelson"" is a masterful work of contrast and parallelism. Emotionally stunted, Charles sacrifices his own personality for that of his hero, Horatio Nelson. Viewing his own life as the ""dark side"" of Nelson's, Charles tries to match his every move to the life of the admiral, not in the sense of accomplishing great tasks, but by taking his wounds. A highly intellegent man, with little self-knowledge, Charles is one of the most vivid portraits to emerge in recent fiction. His gradual emotional evolution costs him dearly, for by tearing down Nelson he tears down himself.The novel is dark, and the ending does feel somewhat forced, but this is certainly a work of fiction that makes you think. It touches on issues that surround our lives - the worth of celebrity and fame, our ties with history, and what we can really know of the past. In a deceptively miniature portrait of a single man, Unsworth takes on these weighty topics and succeeds entirely."
4,I wish I could give this another half star,"I really loved this book, but I agree with another reviewer--to some extent, it doesrun out of steam towards the end. Nevertheless, the writing is brilliant and the pacing is perfect. Also, I found the historical information about Nelson fascinating. Perfect book: entertaining and informative. I will definitely seek out other books by this author."
5,An amazing read about how we look at history,"First and foremost, what a book. This is a great novel and I recommend it very highly. There is so much to talk about with this novel on so many levels. It is part biography of Adm. Nelson, it is part obsession and how we look at famous people whether historical, sports, movies etc., and it is a disturbing look at mental illness.Though the narrator in this book is obsessed with Adm. Nelson you can substitute any historical person or famous person. When does liking someone so much become harmfull to our mental well being?I don't want to give too much away, but this is a great read."
2,A Depressing Read,"If you are suffering from some of life's tribulations at the moment, I suggest that you do not read this book. It is unrelentingly depressing. In following Cleasby and his inexorable slide from mere hero worship of Horatio Nelson to obsession and finally clinical madness, the reader is led down a very dark path indeed. If one word could be used to sum up this novel it would be: DISTURBING. The ending certainly shocked me, but on relection I realised that it shouldn't have. What happens is simply inevitable.Without a doubt Unsworth is an excellent writer. This was my first experience of him and, despite my view of this novel, his obvious talents as an author make me want to read more of his work. However, the bleakness of ""Losing Nelson"" made it impossible for me to enjoy and is my reasoning for giving it a two star rating."
3,"fascinating subject, not too good a book","This book suffers from a lack of chronological treatment, and tells nothing about the personal life of its subject. But it is still enjoyable reading, tho I wished I had had at hand as I read it a set of the U.S. Reports of U.S. Supreme Court cases. It is amazing that Justice Miller thought nothing of sitting on cases argued before the Court by his brother-in-law! Some things have improved over the yeaars, and I am confident nothing like that happens any more."
1,not comfortable and old fashioned style,"This pants look like made for the 80th fashion. Very wide leg (all the way), too many pleats in the front. They don't look classy, they look shlopmy and baggy. I would not recommend it to stylish boys:)"
3,Average,"To be honest, I expected much more from the beautiful and poetic title of the book. But the book consists mainly of the author's personal musing and writing and the philosophical element which I eagerly anticipated is somewhat missing. A little disappointing."
4,Wonderful entertainment,"I had already viewed the video; my son is a big ""Terry Fator"" fan. After seeing the video; I decided to get my own copy for my collection and viewing pleasure. Terry Fator is mesmerizing! His talent is truly a gift from God."
4,Terry Fator is great!,"What a unique act! I think that Jeff Dunham is better on the comedy end, but Terry Fator is better on the amazing impersonations. They are both great. On America's Got Talent, his acts were more Rated-G, but on this video it's more like Rated-PG, with some sexual innuendo. It's fine by me, but if you saw him on America's Got Talent, you may have the impression that the DVD is all rated G and suitable for your small children. It is not, however. This act was recorded live in Vegas and contains more adult-oriented material (which Terry Fator himself did not write, but had a comedy writer). I get the feeling that Fator's comedy writer is a little more raunchy than Fator himself. It's still fairly clean, though, no dirty language. Just not a kid's gig.When will these comedy writers learn that you don't have to be raunchy to entertain???? I wish they'd have a little more imagination, and a lot more class."
2,Terry Fator w/ The Commodores,When I rec'd the above DVD I emailed the shipperto question why there was no mention of The Commodors on the jacket. He was quite indigninte when I questioned him and told me they were there. After I Viewed same I was right so I got taken by him but I'll remember his nameNot happy in Ma. Not your fault Ty Dave
5,Lady Booby: 'nuff said,"What can I say? AM's finest moment. Spectacularly sleazy.Oh, and the rest of the film's nice too, etc."
4,Disjointed Fielding Film Works Despite Itself,"Unlike director Tony Richardson's previous Henry Fielding adaptation, ""Tom Jones"", ""Joseph Andrews"" is not a rousing success. It's bawdy but not particularly sexy. It's intricately plotted yet utterly predictable. It's populated with characters yet falls short in characterization. Why do I give it the pass? Despite it's flaws it gets an ""A"" in high-spiritness. The cast is appealing with veterans Peter Bull and Michael Hordern, up-and-comers Peter Firth and Natalie Ogle, and everything anchored by a terrific turn by Ann-Margret. Go in to this with less than heightened expectations and you will not be disappointed."
1,Joseph Andrews,I did not like this movie at all. I purchased it because of all the good reviews. I guess it was supposed to be funny but I found it to be very very silly. Not much of a plot to this story.
4,Another fine contribution from the Master of Romance,"Fabio has done it again with this solid new work of Romantic fiction. His characters are vigorous and robust, and he has honed his use of the English language like a master craftsman. The dialogue is crisp and original, and the love scenes were graphic yet tasteful. Go Fabio!"
3,Cute but are they sterling silver?,"These earrings are cute; however, it specifies that these are sterling silver. There are no markings of .925 on the earrings to verify that they are indeed sterling silver. My daughter can only wear sterling silver or gold so I hope that these are truly as marketed."
5,"transparent, open sonic fields of beauty!","I picked this up after digging the claudia quintet by Hollenbeck. This CD is vastly different but equally enjoyable!It's delicate beauty and moodiness stunned me. It has some folk influences and I guess some ECM influences but on the whole a original and juicy sonic palette. Skuli Sverrisson creates these open fields of sound that the others play on. Bleckmann is an original-a musician who happens to be a singer (sorry, but I'm usually dark on ""jazz"" singers-he is much more). The Oboe was a great surprise-what a cool exotic sound! Easy to listen to without being ""easy listening"". Deep, almost sacred music. Why isn't Hollenbeck a household name?"
3,great concept- point sometimes missed,"I genuinely liked some of the ideas presented in this book. Yes, the church has a long way to go when it comes to how they choose to teach chastity and purity in a sex-saturated world, and Winner brings up some great points. At times though, her line of reasoning and logic is hard to follow, and often times convoluted. The heart of the book is great, you might just have to re-read things a few times to understand what she's talking about. And unless you have a supersized vocabulary (I'd call mine better than the average American's) be prepared to whip out your dictionary."
5,Dead on!,"This book is honest, realistic, and informative. I disagree with whoever said ""what convent did Winner step out of."" She speaks from the voice of someone who realizes the mistakes her (and many other Christians) have made sexually, and writes a book that speaks honestly about Chastity.The ""Steps of the Rotunda"" chapter is the best."
3,Good read,"I liked what the book had to say. I did have a bit of an issue with the way it was written, so parts were just longer than should have been."
2,Annoying,"For someone who grew in a Christian home, I agree that I didn't have a clue about abstaining except I always heard, ""don't have sex until you are married"", but wasn't really sure how to do that or the real reasons behind it. I was curious to see if this book had some great answers. I feel like she touched on some interesting thoughts and ideas, but should have expounded on them. I felt she trying hard to prove a couple of things: 1. that she was very educated - some of the words she used were unnecessary, especially for teenagers who she seemed to be especially speaking to 2. That she came a long way in her own quest to find out about what God says about waiting - great, but call it that. I thinks it is a bit arrogant to claim to know the ""truth"" about chastity in this little book. She did not do a great job of convincing me. I had a hard time finishing it."
1,It's like taking lessons on divorce-proofing your marriage by a 7-time divorcee,"Girl Meets God is one of my favorite books.Mudhouse Sabbath was a fascinating look into Jewish practices that I reference often.Real Sex just didn't do it for me. After finishing a page or chapter I had no clue what she actually thought about anything. And the writing style was so different than her other books.I will read anything Lauren Winner writes and have benefited from her thoughts. Surely, though, there are better books on the subject of sex, and by people who actually, you know, remained chaste until their wedding night rather than had their fun and then wrote about how the rest of us probably shouldn't."
1,Bait-and-Switch,"The author starts out announcing she's going to give us an informed, world-wise view of a Christian sexual ethic. It never happens. It's a little objectionable to get this book from an author who admits she slept her way through college and much of grad school and has been married a grand total of 3 and a half months. She just gives us the old Pauline fear of sex in a new guise. Her world-view is basically pre-modern and pre-scientific: I agree that sex is ethically clearly meant for marriage, but she wakes up all the old neurosis-inducing crap about the evils of masturbation, immodest clothing, etc, etc. For a scholar of religion, she knows shockingly little about the Bible: she reads Genesis as literal and doesn't know the difference between letters written by St. Paul and those written in his name. And how is it that she can write a book in the early twenty-first century and not mention gay people or lesbians even once? A completely ignorant performance."
1,What a Stinker!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I don't even know where to begin. Like the reviewer Charlie, I too am wondering about the convent Winner came out of.Instead of ways to avoid sex, one ought to consider getting married and enjoying sex the way it was meant to be enjoyed. Parts of the book were just strange.I for one got nothing out of it."
4,A quick read that is rather insightful,"A friend recommended this book and I have passed it along to others. A book that is thoughtfully written from the perspective of someone who has certainly not lead a ""model"" existance. However, it does show how God can really change us literally from the inside out."
4,Nice Ideas,"I haven't personally finished the book yet, but it is full of thoughtful ideas that I could never actually put my finger on before. For example, you know when you just *know* that something is wrong with someone's argument or idea, but you just can't exactly describe what or why? Well, Lauren Winner shares a lot of ideas and explains them in a way that helps the reader ""put your finger"" right on that very thing. At least it has been helping me out personally."
3,"Some good ideas, but not fully realistic","I'm a Christian who's been practicing abstinence for religious reasons, and wanted to do some further reading on the topic to help clarify my views on the issue. I read several books on the topic (the others were Sex for Christians by Lewis B. Smedes, Boundaries in Dating by Henry Cloud & John Townsend, and When God Writes Your Love Story by Eric & Leslie Ludy), and this was among the better ones, though not the best (Smedes' book takes those honors).Winner has a few interesting ideas in her book. She recommends limiting physical activities to only what you would be willing to be seen doing in public. She encourages the church to form an active community of accountability to help support and encourage people in their dating lives. She also takes a very pragmatic approach to marriage, but lauds the role of sex within that marriage.It's an interesting read, but not the best text on the subject that I found (again, the best was Smedes' Sex for Christians)."
4,"A good 32"" TV Set","Had experience with a Pansonic 20"" Tau Set. That one was excellent, a 2001 model, CT20SX11. This one is new. Picture is very good for a non HD TV and considering the size of the tube.Have an antenna for input. Have no cable TV. The tuner does not receive a good stereo broadcast signal, so, when the set is set to stereo, the sound is distorted/scratchy. Had to set it to mono to receive broadcast TV. Not happy about that but viewing DVD and VCR tapes the sound is great as the stereo signal is received and sent out of the TV. There is no adjustment of stereo signal i.e. Stereo/mono/sap from the alternate sources (DVD/VCR).The set really shines viewing DVD's with component cable connections...excellent picture considering not an HDTV Tube.The set is very heavy (161lbs.) and bulky to lug in and set up.Overall quite pleased with the set as it replaced a dying 27"" sony set."
5,K&N oil filter,These are the best filter available! I also use K&N air filter in all of my cars. I totally trust K&N products.
5,Good Quality,"Seems to be a good product - who knows whether there is real value in purchasing a more expensive oil filter - I just like knowing that I have something with a ""good reputation"" protecting my engine - does it really make a difference in the long run - would like to believe so but sure can't prove it..."
3,Cavil about the Editorial Review,"It was not ""about forty years ago"" that Herbert Simon used ""satisficing"" and ""bounded rationality"" to discuss human decision making. He used these terms in 1947 in his book, Administrative Behavior. That's more than 60 years ago."
3,Powertec Olympic Plate Holder Review,"The Powertec Power Rack was received quickly from the shipper. It was easy to assemble and the fit and finish are great. The only cons I have is that the hole for the olympic bar is a bit too short and I had to remove the plastic insert for my 7' olympic bar to fit. Other than that, this is a great weight plate holder and a best bet for the price."
1,Very Dissapointing,"The photo with this item was VERY misleading. Also a used price was available along with the new price. We chose new but pretty sure we were sent used, scratches and two small broken parts. Sent back !!!!!!"
4,Solid Rack,This weight rack is very solid and should provide a lifetime of personal use in my home gym. I like the sleeves as it keeps the weights from moving around. Overall I am very satisfied with the end product.My only issue with this as all Powertec equipment is that the instructions are not much more than a parts list. It can be frustrating putting their equipment together and expect to make some mistakes as you build it because you misunderstand the pictures. Words are not used for the instructions.
4,Great rack for home gym,"This rack is great. Has 7 posts for plate storage with PVC posts for easy removal of plates. The rack is very stable, unlike the previous rack I purchased (and returned) from TSA.My only issue is that the bar holder's internal sleeve is a bit tight so I can't easily place & remove my curl bar but despite that is is worth the money."
2,"Picture Looks Great, Actual Product Very Cheaply Constructed","In the picture on Amazon, this carafe looks very solid and well made. Upon arrival, you'll find that it's very cheaply put together, with a plastic lid, poor alignment of seams, very cheap plastic/metal combinations in other parts....overall not anywhere near the quality of a Bodum or other well-made kitchen brand. I returned mine immediately."
5,Great Quality,"My husband is an all Chicago sports fan (Cubs not Sox) and this shirt has had a lot of wears. The quality is good, it holds its shape well, and it hasn't faded. It also makes a comfy shirt for me to sleep in. Definitely worth the investment!"
3,"Simple book, not so simple plans.",Not a fan of this book. It is more of a picture book than anything. The diagrams show some measurements and give you a little info on the project but there is no step-by-step directions if that is what you are looking for. Some neat little wood puzzles are in the book but most of them are the puzzles where you take the thing apart and wonder how you get it back together or look at it an wonder how it was made.
3,For machine design,"I was looking for something for hand-carving puzzles, but the majority of puzzles in this book were created in the workshop. There were a couple puzzles for handcarving but the majority of the book were projects that would be made with power tools. As usual Amazon was great in accepting my return for other materials."
5,Excellent for Daily Reading,"I was looking for a good NKJV and decided on this one. For daily reading this is an excellent choice. This is not a ""study"" bible. However, the extra features are more than enough to get a solid foundation of Christian helps, principles and ""how-to's"". The type, while not extra-large, is large enough for easy reading. I inserted this book in a bible bag. This bible does not present itself as a ""Billy Graham"" book as much as it does a very good NKJV Bible."
3,Introduction to Forman,"Simon Forman was one of the most fascinating characters of the Elizabethan age. Previous books about him have, however, been abysmally bad, particularly A.L. Rowse's 1974 biography. Traister provides a much more reliable introduction to Forman and his milieu that is concise and accessible to general readers. She describes his life, his astrological-medical practice, his many unpublished writings, his magical pursuits and his involvement in the famous Essex scandal, as the posthumus patsy. This is all irresistible stuff.Specialists will regret that Traister's grasp on the arcana of astrology and angelic magic is not stronger. And for a really thorough examination of his medicine and his patients we shall have to wait for Loren Kassell's forthcoming book. Still, a huge improvement on Rowse."
4,A period piece,"Like Agatha Christie, Patricia Moyes has a way of transporting you to a place and time in history. It is obvious that she knows and loves Kenya in the days of the British colonial times. You feel like you are right there and can visualize the house and the nature. Not until the last chapter did I start to see who the killer is. This is my third book by Moyes and I can't wait to read the rest of them."
3,Compatibility and Too Small Fonts,"I got this unit as a replacement for my Palm Personal. While some have complained about poor backlighting on this Clie it is better than my old unit. There is a big problem with the fonts though. While I could change the display font for the text that I entered the system font, the one used for prompts and icon label etc. is too small for me to read but the ability to change the font of the text that I entered such as in the address book list is changable and is much more ledgable than the my Palm Personal.There is a caviat with compatibility. You MUST have USB v1.1! The HotSync is not compatable with with USB v1.0. Also I had trouble loading the PalmDesktop for Clie on one of my older computers that had had Palm desktop 4.01 installed on it already"
3,Acceptable,"I need a PDA for keeping contacts, appointments and memos. The price and size of Clie SL 10 is ideal. However, it is still larger than what I expected. The display is dark and hard to read under dim light. You need direct light on top of the display to make reading comfortable. Good under bright sun light. I like the text, clear and clean, some people might find it hard to read, because the texts are small. Over all, it is simple device that does every thing I needed."
4,Not bad for [the money],"The Sony Clie SL10 is great! You get all the basic palm functions, sony software, andmore for a low price! It's small size makes it ideal for travel, as do the need for 2 AAA batteries. It's convienient and practical with the day-planner software. And with the Memory Stick expansion slot, you can add up to 128 megabytes of removable memory!"
3,good with reservations,"I bought this for my wife who is a first time PDA user. I use an older handspring model compared to which this unit is sleek and well designed. The font is hard to read under normal light which dissapointed me. The jog dial is really userful and handy. The photo & video applications seem useful for the increased resolution. Over all, a ok buy."
2,Good PDA spoiled by very dim screen,"This PDA is very well made, compact (so that you can carry it nicely in your pockets), stylish looking, crisp hi res screen and lots of software. But all that cannot redeem the achilles heel of this PDA. The screen is very dim and unless you have direct sunlight or light you cannot read it well. In practice I found that 30-40% of the time it was a pain to read it. And the back light is pretty bad and doesn't make much of a difference. Take my advice and skip it for now and wait for the next version SJ20 which is supposed to have much better screen and back light."
3,Good PDA....small font,"I purchased this PDA but had to return it. It has a high resolution display. That is great but it makes some of the font sizes too small (for my eyes, at least). You can adust some of the font sizes but not the fonts, say, in the address book or the icon labels. Also it was just plain too hard to read in ordinary light. I compared it side to side to the Palm it was supposed to replace and it was harder to read than the Palm. You have to look at the screen just so.My eyes are older so if you are young it might not be a problem. When I could read my old Palm better than this Clie I sent it back."
2,Get something better,You won't see the screen since it is not backlit. Dare to light it up and you will change batteries every time you turn it on. As it is it already devours batteries like the devil. Typical example of something cheap that ends up being costly. J.
2,Don't Buy,I just got a new CLIE SL-10 and I want to tell you-I was never as disappointed from a product I bought as I am now!My problem is the screen. It is so dark - you can barley read the text on it (even after changing the contrast)!In order to read the text you have to tilt the PDA and only then can you see anything written on the screen.And what is a PDA good for if you can't read from it???And -no! I don't have any problems with my eye-sight.
1,Clie SL 10,"The product came to me really fast BUT only part of the Clie came--no manual, no software, no cable, no AC adapter, and the person sent two stylus' neither fit this Clie. I've had nothing but problems. When I try to get back to the seller my message bounces back."
1,This PDA resets itself once battery is gone,"I like this PDA, low price and does all the job I want with a good screen resolution. The dim display may cause problem to some people, but it is perfictly fine with me. However, there is a serious problem with this PDA. I use it mainly for contact information. However, this PDA resets itself once the battery is drained, and I lost all the data. It happen to me three times. I will not recomend you to get this PDA for your important data."
4,First PDA,"The Sony Clie SL10 is my first PDA. I think it is great for beginners. I take it everywhere and am just getting the hang of downloading from the Palm website. The size is convenient, can fit it in my smallest purse. The only issue that I have with this product is battery life especially if you have children and a husband that want to take turns playing the games (by the way just ordered one for my husband as a birthday gift) and for some strange reason i get a message that says I have to reset. But I just click on reset and continue was I was doing. Had a little trouble figuring out how to turn on backlight but finally got it after a few days, the manual doesn't mention anything about holding down the power on button. Anyway, love my Clie."
1,"Don't Trust about ""Expandable Memory""","I really like to express the problem I have struggling with Sony SL-10. I thought it was a good buy with additional Memory Stick (MS). I found out it was really a waste becuase I cannot run/read a text book from MS with an application such as Reader in internal system. I had to transfer everthing (all data: a whole textbook)from MS to internal; then, it runs. So, my point is ""Don't get fooled with Memory Expandable."" What is the point of getting a memory stick which you cannot run the programs from? All you can play is with 'internal free space, 7 MB.'I called twice to get help from 1-877-760-7669, but nothing helps. It blames on low memory space.Believe me! Most of us using this product areundergrads, grads and professional students. We need more memory space (without a memory stick)..I regret that I bought it. Now I am in search of a Palm pilot........other than SONY after 2 years frustration with this product."
3,Defective battery cover design,The AAA battery cover slips out easily - causing battery mispositioning & complete data loss. Recommend frequent Hotsync.The rest of it is not too bad for the price.
2,Returned,"While this clié is an adorable little PDA, I was forced to return it after only three days. I tried to love my new little unit, but I simply could not get used to the screen. I adjusted the contrast over and again; I moved from one room to another and even outside; I turned on and off the backlight and still one constant remained - the screen was very difficult to see."
1,Great Idea--Terrible Display,"I owned a Sony Clie SL10 for about 30 minutes. The display is Terribly Dark!!! It didn't matter what type of lighting I was in, it was way too hard to read. I returned it and got the Sony Clie PEG-S360. It cost the same but has a much better display and twice as much memory. I have owned 4 PDA's before this one and this PEG-S360 is truly the best. I got away from Palm products because of the unrealiability of the m125 and because of poor customer service. When I called Sony to ask a question about Hot Sync thay were pleasant and very thorough. They are handling customer service the way Palm use to. I do not recommend the SL10 but I love my PEG-S360."
2,Fatal flaw,Just want to underscore that the dim screen on this PDA ruins an otherwise innovative and well executed product. I bought this and returned it after using it for a couple of days. The screen was simply too difficult to read under most conditions. The lack of Macintosh support was also a glaring omission.
3,Too dim,"Although the resolution and gray scale are excellent, the unit was simply too dim for me. (The screen is also very reflective, which didn't help.) Furthermore, even though the advertisement shows 4 icons across by 6 icons high, neither I, nor the Sony telephone support rep, could figure out how to achieve that (my Palm shows 3 icons across by 4 icons high). I returned the item."
2,Very disappointing - Returned it,"The screen on the SL10 had such low contrast that I had difficulty reading it in every lighting condition. The backlight was feeble. The ""high resolution"" display was a curse in disguise, as the default font that has characters built from lines one pixel wide made for characters so skinny that they were extremely difficult to read. Also disappointing were the weight and thickness of the unit (heavy and thick). I plan to save up a few more dollars for a Palm M500, which is slimmer, lighter and has a much more legible display."
1,lost data,Don't bother with this one. I've had to input all my info twice after having it all erased. The battery indicator showed I still had a third of my power left in my battery both times and after the battery power is gone it erased all the addresses and appointments I had input. The readability and resolution is good but what's the point if you can't access the data. Don't get a pda that uses batteries!
2,Batteries Don't Last,"If you're looking at the SL10 CLIE, be advised that the batteries don't last more than 2 to 3 weeks! I replaced my PALM whose batteries lasted months, with the CLIE and thought something was wrong with the unit because of how fast I was going through batteries. After a second call to SONY Technical suport, and more than my 30 day return guarantee, I was told that is normal for the unit.I'm now struck with a PDA that needs new battereis every 2 weeks and SONY doesn't offer a rechargable battery accessory for this unit.I should have stayed with PALM!"
2,"Crash, crash, crash","That's right. Crash, crash, crash... as in it crashed 3 times in one hour today. I had to do three hard resets (this is very irritating and time consuming, in case you don't know what a hard reset entails). I've had my Clie for 8 days, and it's crashed every other day. I'm sending it back. Unfortunately, I don't know what I'll replace it with, considering there aren't really any quality handhelds in the same price range. Chalk it up to the [price]range and the poor man's PDAs. I gave it two stars. When it IS running, it's better than not having a handheld at all. If you'are also in that [same price range] and below price range like me, save an extra $50 and buy the Palm M500."
3,Great PDA...Disadvantages though,I bought this PDA a few months after it was released. I was happy with it except a few things. I didn't like that it was B&W or that is was not rechargable. There was alot todo with it until almost all the pda's on the market went Color then the software was limited. I really like the functionality and the features. But now I have updated. I would recomment going for the Song SJ22 for a little more money. Tis color and recharagable and alot more funtional.
2,well...it does LOOK cute,"I transferred to the Sony from a Palm M105, and I have to say it was a disappointment. Dim screen makes for bad redability no matter the circumstances; this thing eats batteries for lunch, and the alert sound is so faint you might as well not have it at all. the memory stick feature is nice, but not all that useful if you hotsync frequently. I'm going back to a Palm PDA."
4,John Patrick's Advanced Craps,"This book is quite good. John has some good and proven ideas as how to play the craps game and win some money. Good luck John.I have read another book called: How to Play the Craps Game and Win, by W. Chin. This is a hightly recommended book for all readers. It is basedon actual research project, based on 3.5 years of data gathering and collecting and recording of actual throwing the dices at various casinos, atdifferent time of the week, month, at different casios in Reno and Las Vegas. This book is fill with tables, graphs, forms and others for readersto use and record actual playing this craps game at a given table. I am highly recommend this book for everyone. You will not regret to buy this book.James Lewis of Oakland, Ca."
1,Not So Advanced!,"I have read this book several times. I have tested all of the systems in the book at great length and all have had the same results. All of the sytems and methods outlined in the book are, in the long run, losers. The best thing that can be accomplished (and not by all the systems) is that you learn how to manage your money and to leave the table if you should have a short term win. The newer books on craps have been revised to include more disclosures, but all in all this one has no more value than any other I have read. If any of the methods outlined in the book actually made money Las Vegas would be a ghost town."
4,Corny but good,"The lingo in the book is very out of date, I mean the guy refers to Dolly and Lonnie as the current babes! However, the money management and discipline information in this book are invaluable to any gambler. You also get the impression that Mr. Patrick is a ""good guy"" and that counts alot with me. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to enhance their craps strategy."
3,It gives you an insight about money management on craps,"It takes several months to read this book completely.This book does not drive you to go to casinos.However, the author emphasizes that money managementis more important than knowing the rules of craps.John Patrick argues to the reader to have the feelings of ""Bank Roll"" and ""Charting the table"".Yes, that was really important lesson that I have learnedfrom him.I recommend to buy this book if you want see it howthe craps professional manages his winning!Thank you for reading my comments.From, wyse at Seoul, Korea."
3,Good Money Management,"Money Management ideas and placing 6 & 8 lessons were spot on. I and I'm sure a great many other craps players thought of ""The Patrick System"" on our own. His suggestion to use hardway bets, the yo and the 12 as hedge bets makes no sense.The house edge is too high on those bets and while you might feel good occasionally when one of them hits, you will certainly lose in the long run. He stresses throughout the book to chart a table before playing. Every dice roll is totally independent of all prior rolls. A shooter who makes three points in a row has just as much chance of making the fourth as he did of making the point on his first roll.Three shooters in a row could crap out and then the next one could make ten points a row. Charting a table is a waste of time I'm surprised he emphasized it so much."
5,Finest craps strategy ever written,The basic technique on the Place bet and use of hedge ie covering bets paid for this book several times several times over(no thats no repeat typo. Some books I lend..others I do not...this is a must have reference book for serious craps players.
5,This is the best crap book,"I have been buying Crap books, since the 1980's. This is the most information that I have seen on any book of Craps. This is a must book for advance players. Some of the people he writes about, remind you of yourself. He hits close to home. I have used this to update, my own personal system. I was a winner of craps before this book. The Hedge information,The break down of all bets, money management,is very valuable. Great Price.Thankmuddy323"
2,So dated - It's hard to read.,"I am relatively new to craps. I can play but don't really understand the nuance of the game. Saw the reviews and bought it.I find John's banter intolerable: ""macho type dude, with muscles bigger than Dolly Pardon's trademarks,"" ""Does Sophia Loren look like a boy?"". I'm sure it a generational thing. It's kind of like having Buddy Love teach you trigonometry.Anyway, some good information that's just really hard to get to. I'm looking for something modern and less dramatic."
1,"""piece of crap""","Don't waste your money. Patrick's main thesis is that you can't win unless you take money off the table (regress). Profound! He then fills his book with example after redundant example of how to do this. Beyond that, much of what he states is just plain wrong. For example, he argues that conceding the house a small vig on more likely numbers (i.e., place betting the 6 or 8) is better than getting true odds on other less likely (roll-out) numbers. No wonder he writes a lot of books .. he needs to make up for his gambling losses!"
3,"great price, mediocre performance",just got this gamepad and i've been using it for about a half hour. setup was easy but for some reason the d-pad locks up which can get very frustrating when playing games.
2,underwhelmed to say the least,"i have heard about sylvia weinstock for years and was very disappointed to find that her book is not only poorly edited and printed( the photos are very amateurish nad the instructions are scant) but also trite considering the reputation of the author. Having tried recipes, i found that they are mediocre and the instructions are lacking in the detail needed to create a masterpiece cake."
3,SWEET CELEBRATIONS,"I AGREE WITH YOUR REVIEW WITH ONE EXCEPTION, AND THAT IS THAT THE BOOK SKIPS LIGHTLY OVER THE ART OF SUGAR DOUGH. IN FACT, THERE IS NEITHER A RECIPE FOR SUGAR DOUGH NOR IS THERE A REFERENCE TO A COMMERCIAL SOURCE. IT ASSUMES THE READER ALREADY HAS EXPERTISE IN SUGAR DOUGH. PERHAPS MS. WEINSTOCK IS LOATHE TO PART WITH HER ""SUGAR DOUGH SECRETS"". IN ANY EVENT, I FELT CHEATED BY THIS GLARING OMISSION."
1,I was expecting something much better,The directions are very simplistic and very vague. Some of the photographs are printed backwards! The photography seems amateurish. I was very disappointed!
2,not too informative if you are a novice,"Beautiful cakes, of course, they are Sylvia's! But as a novice cake decorator I didn't find the book helpful."
5,Sweet Celebrations,"Oh my goodness! The recipes in this book are to die for. Sylvia has The Best Spice Cake recipe in here, you've just got to try it. Yummy!!! No wonder she is in such demand, her cakes are fabulous and her flowers, are unbelievable. This is the got to have book if you never get another one."
2,A Disappointment,"One would think that if the doyenne of NYC cakebakers would finally write a book on her craft it would contain at least fabulous photos of her most ravishing creations. It certainly does not. Compared to the quality of photos of Colette Peters' books, this tome is [...]indeed. HOWEVER, having eaten her cakes many times, they are flawless, and while she really doesn't offer all that much clear, organized info on the production of her most beautiful designs (she has some photos of them, but doesn't discuss them), her cake recipes are almost worth the price of the book."
3,Fair,"Cakes' decorating instructions in this book don't seem to be very clear to me. While the book displays beautiful cakes, it lacks information/instructions for the most beautiful ones. Personally, I found this book to be of little help. However, it could be used as reference for those who master cake decoration skills. With all the respect to the author, it has beautiful cakes with little information."
2,"Some pretty photos, poor instruction, disappointing recipes","As a cake decorator of moderate experience - buttercream, fondant, some gumpaste - I have to say this book is not at all helpful. Instruction is either absolutely basic or so poorly illustrated you can't figure it out. All four recipes I tried were failures, though I am a baker of some experience. Dry cakes without flavor, and fillings so rich they were unpalatable. Any of Colette Peters' books are far better for decorating ideas and recipes, and Scott Clark Wooley's ""Cakes by Design"" has far superior instructions for gumpaste flowers."
1,All about the sugar frosting,"This book is the same as many Wedding Cake books I find, in that it is all about the frosting -- outdated, sugary, unimaginative flavors on novelty cakes that don't have much to say for themselves except sweet, sweet sweet. Brides today have had enough pretty-but-flavorless cakes that are only a showpiece, eaten somewhat reluctantly by guests who feel compelled to partake. They want something beyond piles of fluffy sugar that leaves a thick coating on the tongue. This book doesn't provide it."
3,An Old and Difficult Translation,"When it comes to ancient and early modern science, the reader must expect unfamiliar vocabulary and concepts. This set of translations is probably fine as far as it goes, but it does not go far enough. A set of helpful footnotes and a glossary would make it much more useful."
2,You can feel his awe of God,"However his doctrine is off. I dont agree with most of what he talks about. The man is educated, but seems have an agenda."
4,One of the best racing games!,"This game has good graphics,has a good selection of cars, and the cars are easy to control. Also there's different types of racing like tournament, single race, time trial, and CWG Ralley. So if you want a sweet racing game that is [affordable], this is the game."
3,Challenging but fun,"This game is fun, the cars are o.k., but this game is NOT for beginers. It is really hard and you only get two cars in the begining a Ford Explorer and a Ford Mustang. To get the rest of the cars you have to work really hard to beat tracks. If you have a Gameshark then the game is a must buy if you don't all I have to say is ""Good luck""!"
5,Reluctant Dissenter,"I found this autobiography among the best 5% of books that I have ever read. The author has spent his life as a highly motivated, dedicated idealist. His insights are valuable to me in my own development. His unusual abilities and remarkable personal humility are an unusual combination. As a Roman Catholic, I found that he dealt with some of the Roman Catholics' most difficult problems with the church hierarchy in a charitable and inspiring fashion. His enthusiasm, courage, and optimism in the face of unexpected attacks on his work from his own church should lead us all to an enthusiasm and vision of the church which is positive for the world, the church, and ourselves."
1,Confusing,"Very confusing timeline. It is difficult to understand exactly what transpired in his mind, and how the whole story fits together."
1,The sad story of a deeply confused man.,"The story of a deep tragedy, of a man who had so much working in his favor, and then couldn't understand the beauty God gave us in marital relations. The story of a man who has joined the culture of death."
4,the beginning of serious scary music,"Well, people know there were Venom, Motorhead, Angel Witch, Mercyful Fate , but serious thrash and death began when these 3 excited Venomaniacs from Switzerland started Hellhammer with (in a way) a punk spirit (do it yourself way of life). It wasn't perfect, but the ugliness and raw side of their heavy metal, in a way, opened the gate to death metal and also the second wave of black metal. If you want to understand Obituary, Possessed, early Mayhem, Necrophagia, Morbid Angel and so on, start here with this cult release!!!!!"
3,Nice little E.P.,"I thought ""APOCALYTIC RAIDS"" was pretty good, but not exellent or great by a longshot. It is more for historical purposes in seeing how this would influece countless black and death metal bands of the future, as well as being essentially a embryonic version of Celtic Frost. The overall sound of the recording is very primative and raw, practically oozing out of the speakers in what must be some strange form of sonic sludge never experienced before or since. The 9 minute ""Triump of Death"" is the center piece of it all, a slow, doomy epic with Tom G. Warriors viceral grunts and screams going all over it.Tomas' voice can hardly be understood on this. He seems to use his voice more as atmosphere rather then a means to convey lyrics. Guitars are very simplistic and almost punk-like, save for speed. My favorite track on the whole thing has to be ""Agressor"", which has drums from Hell and in my book the most memorable riffs to it. Nothing sounds like this."
5,F'ing Bad Ass,"One of the most dark, artistic, and hard-core metal albums of all time. Triumph of death will definately be played at my wedding right after another one bites the dust. This album is also indescribable for pissing-off neighbors and most senior citizens."
2,"Get it if you are into ""Celtic Frost"" !",Hellhammer was the name of CELTIC FROST before they were renamed. The compositions in this album are quite immature and simple. The sound carries the signature of Celtic Frost.
4,8.00 holly cow!!!!!!!!!,this is realy good for 8 bucks it comes eith a pilot 1 mech 2 infantry 2 vehixles and other good stuff not half bad im very pleased at the solitar i got and recomend it to any starter and any pro becaues it is al for 8.00!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Great Expensive Fun,"I have been a fan of the Battletech PC games since MW2, and as a MW (Mechwarrior) fan, this does not disappoint me at all. As a game the rules seem simple, but after a few times I began to realize that it can really be a rather complex game. This is good since it is easy to learn and still leaves plenty of strategy for the players to learn and apply. The figures have great detail, but are rather fragile (they won't just fall apart on you, but can be broken with an outside force very easily). The reason I say that the game is semi-educational is that games which are based on numbers tend to teach basic math skills as well as the concepts of efficiency and logical reasoning (suddenly one needs to learn to ask one's self ""Is this the best move I can make?"" and ""Are these the best units I can use for this particular battle?""). I tutor a 7 year old and a 12 year old ADHD patient to teach these ideas (Don't tell them that though!)."
2,didn't love this book,"This is a play on the classic version on this story. I think the story is akwardly layed out and that there isn't much to it. I LOVE Alison Jay's illustrations, in fact that's what made me decide to buy it. The story didn't live up to my expectations."
2,synthetic women's soccer cleats,Good posterior & medial ankle support but the back of the ankle is too high & is not flexible enough. This is the area that rubs every time I wear them. The synthetic material just does not conform or break in very easily. Another player I know had same shoes with the white stripes & c/o getting blisters in the same area at the achilles.
5,FOR SERIOUS ON LINE RACING,"My son loves racing on line with Nascar2003 and others...We have bought him many Logitech racing wheels. They are not bad, but the pedal shafts are made of plastic and break very easily. For roughly 25 cents, they could replace these with metal and greatly improve the longevity.This Thrustmaster works better in every way. The shafts are metal and they last forever. The shifter makes for more realistic racing. If you have enthusiastic on line racers in your house choose this one, or keep buying new ones every 4 or 5 months. The first one we bought 18 months ago still works fine. Just bought another so two can race at the same time in our house!"
3,"Good, but lacking some key information","This book provides a solid overview of the important concepts and procedures of metal spinning, but is missing some key information. Wiley discusses assembling complex pieces and spinning more difficult forms, but omits basic details like the assembly of the metal and follower on the lathe, and the proper use of a back stick. These details probably seem like second nature to an experienced spinner like Mr. Wiley (which is probably why they were left out), but their absence can pose a daunting (though not insurmountable) challenge to the beginner."
5,The Only Real Step-by-Step Spinning Instruction Book,"Other books on the market talk about spinning; show general examples etc. This book shows step-by-step instruction. Once you start trying spinning on your own, and then use this book as a reference, you will appreciate the insights given in this book even more. It's the best book on the markst, and I have them all."
5,Insights of a committed craftsman.,"Paul Wiley has written a very useful, insightful, instructional book on metal spinning which beginning-to-intermediate spinners would find most enjoyable. I cannot speak for those who are more advanced. The book is full of good quality black and white photos which enhance the book's instructional value. The book reflects the author's committment to perpetuating an old and esthetically pleasing craft. This book is a must for beginning or self-taught spinners."
5,The Art of Metal Spinning: A Step-By-Step Guide to Hand-Spinning,"Metal spinning is a dying art. Even on the web, information is scant. For those who want a practical introduction, as well as some advanced features, this is the book for you. Some great tips and information otherwise not available. Highly recommended for those exploring the art, or for anyone wanting to enhance their overall metal-work knowledge."
3,Good but...,This is a good book from Rachael Ray. It has good recipes but I expected a lot more pictures.
3,Cookbook,"I do not like cookbooks that have minimal photographs. Also, many of the recipes contain ingredients that you cannot find in small town USA. We have not cooked anything from it yet and have had it a while."
2,rachael ray 365,While they are very good recipes I found them to involved for me for simple family meals
2,disappointed,Very disappointed. Small amount of photos. Will probably not use. Her books are always to great I was very disappointed.
5,fantastic,"Great book. Lots of different choices for apps, entrees and desserts. Wish I had more time to try a different one everyday."
3,"Meh, at Best","I've tried a number of recipes from this collection and none of them have been really great. All of the recipes have been easy to follow, but the results are mediocre at best. I'll probably end up playing around with some of them to see if I can get them to work, but this isn't the greatest collection of recipes in the world. I'm glad I received this book as a gift, otherwise I would have felt like I had wasted my money."
2,I should make my own cook book,"Now I love watching the show and I think Rachel Ray is great. But this book has a bunch of meals that arent very practical. I mean the average person doesnt keep all these things just hanging out in their fridge! I think this book should have been called Rachel Ray's cook book for parties or ""if you want to impress your in laws""!"
1,This book and the others are a joke,"It amazes me that this young woman claims to at home cooking for friends and family as often as she states on TV , writes one book after another and appears on whatever television station she can get on AND all this culinary expertise she has came with no culinary training whatsoever. This girl was a tv anchor or whatever and because she cooked at a department store demo kitchen, she is now an expert?This is all Hollywood hype and an insult to the well trained and dedicated chefs of the world. This book is a joke. She is 'teaching' things that are absolutely wrong and putting foods together that only a garbage disposal could stomach.I got this book as a gag gift. It did just that. Try books by the American test kitchen, which are good cookbooks."
1,Too much hype,"Rachel Ray gets too much hype, I could believe my ears when she said on national t.v. (Oprah) that she never went to cooking school yet landed a job on the Food Network. If I found her to be a great cook, I would say she deserves a 5 star, but honestly she is just a young person who was lucky to have someone think she can cook. Anyone can stand in her place and do the same thing if they are told what to do, and this book is nothing out of the extraordinary so save your money. Not worth it."
1,Please STOP this woman!,"Enough. The recipes are boring and her television persona is insipid. If your idea of great food extends beyond a can of mushroom soup added to what's leftover in the frig, then pass this one up."
1,"for the love of god, don't buy this","Rachel Ray is the most annoying person on the face of the planet right now. If she had any talent other than a (supposedly) cute face she would be a chef at some restaurant and wouldn't bother us with her opinions. Nothing in this book would ever be worth knowing. And she gets bonus demerits for having a word used for years put into the OED, attributable to her."
3,I am amazed with this new cooking guru,"I was amazed when Rachel Ray said on Oprah that she never attended cooking school. I wonder how she ended up on Food Network. If you try to make food basedof these recipes in 30 minutes you need all known and unknown gods to help you.If you have connections and you are pretty as Rachel Ray, you can stand in her place and do the same thing if you are told what to do. Easy.I give her 5 stars only because Rachael Ray is hugely likeable TV personality, and she works hard and knows how to get too much hype.You can do it also if you have a stove and connections. Even if you are not as pretty as she is (Martha and Orphan are opposite the word pretty but they did cooking, selling, decorating, all that) just follow their promo techniques, and you will be enlightened."
5,Must Have!!!,"I have had Rachael Rays 365 No Repeats cookbook for a few months. I have been using it at least 4 times a week...It is amazing!!! My family (which includes 2 picky teenagers) and I LOVE this book! Even food we don't usually like is awesome when prepared per her EASY to follow instructions! The only advise you really need is to have your food prepped as it is listed on the ingredient list before hand (ie tomatoes, chopped). Otherwise follow her instructions and you will feel like a REAL cook (like my grandma who never used measuring spoons/cups)! My friends are in awe and my family Loves Rachael Ray meals. It is so nice to no longer hear..""I don't like it."" (before it is even tried!) Instead, my family and friends have learned to trust it will be good and give it a try! A Miracle! Worth twice the price! I have never had a cookbook where so many recipes are keepers (so far all have been keepers and some are All-time Favorites!)"
4,Enjoyable Format,Rachael Ray's no-nonsense approach is refreshing. The unusual format for locating recipes works for me. I purchased the book because of her cooking show....I don't like to take a lot of time nor invest in exotic ingredients when I cook. The meal I chose for this evening was delicious as promised - and I did substitute a bit as she often suggests. Good value book!
2,"Awh, I gave this as a gift...","I bought this for myself, but wound up giving it as a gift, b/c I don't eat a lot of the stuff she had in her book, so I wanted someone to get a good use out of it!"
4,"Fun and Easy, with a few caveats","I've been using this book for about a year, and so far, I've really liked it. I'm a fan of Rachael's show, so I have a general idea of how her cooking works. That makes it easier to enjoy the book.It's almost become my go-to book when I'm looking for something new to make. My husband is something of a picky eater, and there are some ingredients he's turned his nose up at, but overall, we've liked the recipes, and the book makes it easy to substitute if there's something you don't like.The only thing I'm not fond of with this book is the way the alternate recipes are handled. You have to go back through the ingredient list and instructions to make sure you're not leaving anything out because the alternate recipes are only an add/drop list, along with which instructions should be changed. It would be easier if the entire recipe was printed again, but I think they didn't do it that way because it would take up too much space."
3,"Delicious recipes, a little 'different'","I loved the idea of 365 new ideas. I love everything I have made from this book. Maybe I should have realized new ideas means new shopping lists. I had not even heard of alot of ingredients in this book(olive tapenade, jarred hot pepper rings, italian fontina just to name a few.) Every time I try to branch out and try a new recipe I reach for this book. I nearly never have all of the ingredients on hand. This book would be great if you plan your meals in advance or have a lot of knowledge about what you can substitute in a pinch.When I have made some of the recipes they have always gone over well with the whole family. They taste great, but if you count the extra trip to the specialty grocery store, the meals take a bit more than 30 minutes :)"
1,Don't bother,I got this cookbook for christmas last year because I enjoy watching Rachel Ray's cooking show on TV. There was not one recipe I would consider cooking. She is just trying to make as much money off us as she can. Not worth the money.
1,Disappointed,"Disappointed with the recipes, however book is set up nicely to take one recipe and preapre 2-3 meals with subliminal changes."
1,She's annoying and so is this book!,"I received this cookbook as a Christmas gift to my misfortune! I liked Rachael back in the days when her head wasn't so big and not so annoying. These days, I can't stand the sight and sound of her! There is not one recipe in this cookbook that I would want to make. There is no index and most of the recipes are just ""repeated"" with one or two ingredients changed. I especially don't like the recipes of food that her dog, Boo likes! I have 20 other cookbooks that I peruse through but this one will definitely be re-gifted or collect dust."
1,SUCKS,Unless you live next door to a Whole Foods market DO NOT buy this book! I only have about 30% of the ingredients on any given recipe in my pantry. Save the money on both and go out to eat.
1,a terrific door stop.,"this woman has nothing to back up the hype. her foods are nothing more than decent, at best, and usually far from ""healthful"". this book is seriously one of the least inspiring things i have ever received- and i will gladly list it on ebay."
1,"Cheerily, eerily dumbed-down cooking","If you ever watch Rachael Ray on the Food Network chow down on $40.00 per day at locales across the country, you will learn what is wrong with her: she likes everything. No discrimination in evidence anywhere. She will suit the great majority who experience as an occasion for social anxiety the idea of developing discernment, studying culinary technique, asserting a critical evaluation or believing a good product requires effort. In Miss Ray's universe, everything is easy and everything is equivalent and effort has no place.Her cooking reminds me of the parties people talk about having--and thankfully never do---where you bring the Campbell's soup-based casseroles and jello desserts your mother made to a big, campy pot-luck.If you consider melted cheese over hot dogs an attractive dinner option, this is the cookbook for you."
3,"Sounds great, but a lot of ingredience.","All of the recipes sounds great but I feel overwhelmed by the amount of ingediences. I live on a budget and these recipes are not real budget friendly. To shop for one of these recipes might take up 1\2 of my weekly meal planning budget. But I am not going to give up on Rachaels recipes, she does have a very big variety of different types of meals to offer in this book."
1,Disappointed,I was VERY disappointed in this book. Not only were the meals bland but the cooking instructions were not well written.... I can't even begin to say how disappointed I was and still am.
2,A Disappointment,"I have other books by Rachael and was disappointed with this one. It's like she just ran out of good ideas, but needed to create a book to fulfill her 2005 requirement. I will be donating this to the local library. I suggest that you borrow this from a friend or library before investing in it."
5,A Gift For Variety,"Rachel makes variations easy. Just to imagine having a different meal every single evening is amazing. But then so are the recipes she has in her book. It has become one of my favorite cookbooks.Janet Sue Terry author of A Rich, Deliciously Satisfying, Collection of Breakfast Recipes ISBN 1932586431"
2,30 minutes? No way.,The meals are delicious and have been a nice difference. So far none can be made in 30 minutes--typically 90 minutes would suffice.
5,really nice book,"For christmas I receive 2 recipe book as gift this one and Simple and Simply Delicious by sylvie Rocher. Both books are great. They have many recipes from spain, italy, france cuba, india, greek , thai....etcSo far I have made theWarm Lemon Chicken Sandwich with Arugula and PearsSouthwestern Pasta Bake and Tomato Basil Pasta Nestsit's very tasty and delicious !I will recommend this book"
3,Not as dynamic as the TV show,"I ordered this book after visiting the US and seeing Rachael Ray on TV. I thought she was great and liked her no-nonsense approach -- very charismatic. I am less thrilled with the book, which is good for basic inspiration, but isn't really that captivating. I just don't see myself going back to this cookbook again and again as I do with some of my favorites (including Australia's Donna Hay, and Mark Bittman's basic but fabulous ""How to Cook Everything"")."
3,A Year of Difficult to Read Recipes,"The recipes are excellent but the publisher needs to re-visit the ""color scheme."" Dark green print on light green paper makes it very difficult to quickly glance at the recipe and know what comes next. Definitely not a very good introduction to Rachael Ray's interesting collection of 30 minute meals."
3,"Good, but not realistic","I like the recipes, but some of the food choices are not realistic with a normal grocery store. Also some of the meat choices are quite expensive. There is a lot of veal and lamb. I just found these out of my league. Some of the vegetable choices are also bizarre. I know im just a medium beggining cook so thats probably why I had to google some of the ingredients. It kind of feels like she was pressured and just through as much junk in there as possible. I like RR, most times she has good meal ideas, wonderful ones actually. But when you have to chunk out book after book, im sure you get fried out of ideas. Dont buy if you want some stuff you know youll cook all those 365 days! Buy if you feel like experimenting ""different dinners"""
3,Rachael Ray 365: No Repeats--A Year of Deliciously Different Dinners (A 30-Minute Meal Cookbook),It was easy to read but some of the ingrediants are a little different so I have to learn how to try some new things.
3,An ok recipe book,Was ok I have seen more interesting recipe books. I bought as a gift for my mom and she really hasn't tried any recipes from it.
2,"too much, not enough","I was disappointed in this cookbook. The organization, based on ""Master Recipes,"" is too disjointed. There are too many recipes based on ground meat, too much chorizo, too much cumin, too much reliance on fresh herbs (which most people don't have ""on hand,"") too many asian-inspired dishes, too many dishes mixing sweet and savory, ie. raisin and caper sauce, I'm still trying to wrap my mind around that! Too many dishes using chicken tenders or skinless boneless chicken breasts. This cookbook only prooves my previously-held theory, that quick cooking pretty much requires expensive ingredients."
2,Not for Calorie Counters,"I bought up this book based on the hype and I was immediately disappointed that there wasn't any nutritional breakdown per serving for the recipes. I have no idea how many calories, fat, fiber, etc. are in each recipe - something important to me since I am just about always watching my weight.In skimming through the book, she uses a lot of higher fat ingredients than I usually use which also turned me off. For a 365 day recipe book, there were very few vegetarian or fish dinners. On the plus side - she had some interesting recipes that I'll probably try, even if I have to modify to a lower fat version, but for the most part, I think this book will gather dust on my bookshelf. Sorry Rachael Ray fans."
2,It's just ok.,"I did make some kind of turkey burgers with butter and tobasco sauce...I think they were buffalo turkey burgers...don't have the book in front of me...and they were quite good. It had a blue cheese sauce, YUM-O! (To quote Ms. Ray). She finished off the patties in the sauce...I made a variation...I take the buns and soak them for a few seconds in the butter/tobasco sauce and grill them...it's the only way my picky son wants his burgers now! So, the girl is inventive...it's just not my first pick for a cookbook at supper time. Know what I mean?"
3,"Cookbook, yummy recipes, but needs more pictures","Wow, lots of recipes.......They look yummy. Just love Rachael Ray.....I think the cookbook can use many more pictures.....one for each recipe would be wonderful......"
3,Do you like to chop?,"Good meals but do not be fooled by the ""30 Minute Meal"" phrase. It takes 30 minutes to prepare, 30 minutes to cook, 10 minutes to eat and 30 minutes to clean up. O and an hour to go to the store and buy the items you do not stock in your kitchen."
2,Not great,"This book has some really simple, delicious recipes.But most of the ones we tried just weren't that good. Another downside is that many recipes require rather esoteric ingredients that we wound up buying, use a little bit of, then throwing away when they went bad."
3,"Yummy food, but the book format is lacking.","What I have enjoyed in Rachel's other books and her cooking show has been the MENUS. There was always a main course and a side and/or salad. Hey, just because I love to cook doesn't mean that at 6pm my brain is fully functioning any more for the day. So the organization or LACK OF ORGANIZATION is a detriment to the quality of the book. I agree with a couple of the other reviews that it appears that this book was RUSHED! Which is a shame. As usual there are not enough pictures either!Recipes 10Book - 2"
2,Hard to Find Ingredients,"I bought this book hoping to add some variety to our family meals. I live in a rural area with what I consider ""normal"" grocery stores. A lot of the ingredients Rachel's recipes call for are impossible to find in my area. I also thought many of the recipes were similar in that they had an Italian theme. I have to say I was highly dissappointed with the book. I wish I had spent my money on a different cookbook."
5,Great Book!,"I like this book. I think the recipes turn out wonderful, and why not put out many books? Obviously she loves cooking and sharing her recipies with everyone.Her recipies are healthy, and that's an important contribution in and of itself."
1,High Fat Cookbook,"I was given this Rachel Ray's cookbook as a Christmas gift and I am not impressed at all. Rachel Ray is not a chef. I found the recipes in this book, high in fat and without taste. My copy has been donated to Good Will."
1,Disappointed,I've always enjoyed watching Rachael Ray and placed her new book on my Christmas list. I keep looking at it and still cannot find anything that inspires me to head for the kitchen and I do enjoy cooking. It's too bad and had high hopes for this cookbook.
1,Love Her Show - Hate Her Book,Just because you like her perky little TV show does't mean you'll like her book. The recipes are Okay BUT there are very few illustrations of the food. I'm more interested in seeing the food than simply reading page after page of recipes. This book is not easy to follow and without pictures you have no idea what you are cooking. Save your money.
4,Love Rachel - Love the book!,"Like many couples my wife and I both work, get home late, go shopping, and start thinking about dinner. This excellent book takes at least one variable out of the equation (thinking about dinner). Makes shopping a lot easier too. The recipes are easy with tons of great pictures. I like her books because she offers up so much for so little - these recipes aren't just another 100 ways to make mashed potatoes but real meals that most people will really enjoy. Don't misunderstand - this won't be the last word on the Fine Art of Cooking (which takes a whole lot longer than thirty minutes) but it's a great book for the busy. Good book."
2,I bought the Kindle version,"Typically I'm a fan of Rachael Ray. I wanted to cook my way through a year and I thought this would be perfect. The main thing I didn't like about the Kindle version was that it didn't show pictures. I really like to know what my food is supposed to look like. I also didn't care for the fact that while it clearly says ""No Repeats"" on the front there were so many recipes that only required you to change a meat or another simple ingredient. If you don't mind not seeing pictures or having similar meals then I would recommend this to you. Everybody has different tastes and this just wasn't for me."
5,Rachels fantastic book for everyday use,"the book is great, u can use the straight recipes or u can interchange add ur own flavours and still come away with a yummolicious meal, thanks rachel ray"
4,365 no repeats rachel ray,Reveiced in good condition and it is a great book. Already went thru and marked the must makes.
4,Rachel Ray 365 cookbook,This item was just what I was looking for to create meals after a busy day at work.
3,Few Pictures,"If you're a visualizer you may be disappointed. No repeats but several creative manipulations of main ingredients. No gourmet dishes. Simple doable meals. Other than the lack of pictures, it's a fantastic book, and I would recommend this to anyone with kids or a busy schedule. Good Healthy Meals in 30 minutes. People who have bought this book and tried it out gave it an average 4.6 out of 5 stars:http://www.buzzillions.com/prd-333103-precision-series-365-30-minute-meals-no-repeats-reviews/"
2,Useless repetitive recipes w/ same ingredients,"Although I love her TV show, I was unimpressed with this recipe book and quite disappointed. Most of the recipes have very similar ingredients; hot pepper, cheese and garlic. They are not ""quick and easy"" as I was expecting and after skimming the book, I found only 1 recipe I was willing to try. If you are looking for simple quick recipes, this in NOT the book you want. Being my son has a severe milk allergy, I cannot use most of these recipes due to the vast amount of cheese required and I am afraid eliminating the cheese will compromise the intended flavor of the dishes."
1,Unhealthy unappetizing recipes,"If you want to have a heart attack by the age of 40, use this book. Almost all the recipes are filled with high-fat, high-sodium artery cloggers like cheese, bacon, hamburgers, and hotdogs. She'll try and tell you that her recipes are ""healthful"" but don't believe her.I do love cheese, I admit it, but I try and use it sparingly, whereas her meals are centered around cheese and fat. Furthermore, they just don't taste good! You can eat this slop at any mall food court."
1,Dust collector on the bookshelf,"I like watching Rachel Ray on TV. I like her energy and creativity. Unfortunately, the book is awful. Seems like she put 30 min of thoughts into this books. There is no order, it takes just about 30 min to find right recipe. There is not pictures whatsoever, only piled up recipes. Hard to choose any recipe without seeing final product. This book is worthless. Anyone who wants free copy, contact me, I will be glad to get rid of mine which is new and never been used."
4,Rachel Ray 365:No Repeats--A Year of Deliciously Diffirent Dinners,Great cookbook with easy and quick recipes for all tastes.
2,Rachel Ray 365: No Repeats,"I did NOT like this cookbook and I cook all the time!!!!! The ingredient list for each recipe is very long and often includes items that you can't find in every grocery store - like arugula, gruyere cheese (which was like $20 for a chunk), etc. In addition, the recipes do not take 30 minutes or less, they usually take almost 2x the time. If I was Rachel Ray and had someone to clean, chop, organize everything for me, then maybe I could do these recipes in 30 minutes or less. Finally, the finished recipes are okay - maybe a 6 or 7 out of 10, but not incredible. So my final review is that for the time, effort, and expense involved in these recipes, it's not worth it. I wish I could return this cookbook!"
3,GOOD RECIPES BUT.......,"There are just an endless number of quick and easy cookbooks in the marketplace today, so in that respect this one fits in with the rest. What I did like about the book was the actual recipes. The Oregon-style pork chops with cranberries was one of my favourites, but the Chipotle chili did not just stick to my ribs, it almost burnt them! These are 30-minute meals, more or less, and the recipes overall are quite good. The recipes do make suggestions for substitutions, which was convenient and helpful.What I did not like about the book was the way it was laid out. It was like encountering a maze and you wondered where to go next. There were other bits of info added that, to me, only got in the way. One recipe can make more than one meal and it can take you just as long to decipher the recipe as it can to actually prepare the meal. For that reason, the book rated middle of the road - good recipes, terrible organization."
2,Not practical,To me this book isn't practical. Many of the ingredients are not in local grocery stores and the recipes aren't that quick and easy.
1,"Sorry, Rachel...","I bought this book with great anticipation; however, after making several recipes, I am very dissapointed. Many dishes I've tried have absolutely NO FLAVOR at all. If you like dinners from the 1950's, you may like this; but for experienced cooks with sophisticated palates, this is not worth buying. The fact that there are 170 of these used books for sale should tell you something."
3,Okay,"This was my first Rachel Ray cookbook and I have a few favorite dishes that I now cook regularly. However, as many others have said, if you include prep time it will take more than 30 minutes, as many of the recipes use A LOT of ingredients. I'm not an experienced cook and was hoping for something a little more simple. I also found the organization of the recipes had no rhyme or reason, there's not a nice grouping of chicken recipes all together or anything that makes it easy to find the recipes you may be looking for. Many of the recipes are just the same recipe from the previous page, but with a few of the ingredients switched out, so it's not actually 365 unique meals. Not that that matters as there are still plenty of recipes to try and keep you busy for quite a while."
4,Rachael Ray cookbook,"I borrowed this book from my brother to try it out. There were so many recipes I wanted to try and after trying out 3 great ones, decided to buy my own copy. The recipes are easy and have great results. the ChickenTortilla Soup with Lime is better than any restaurant!"
5,The BEST Everyday Cookbook!,"We have been so pleased with these recipes! Perfect for everyday, and adaptable (with added side dishes and appetizers) for company! We've made about 60% of the recipes so far, and have had one miss (Super Mashpots--- ho-hum) and about 200 HITS!!!!!!!! Try the Mamacello Chicken--- OMG amazing!An outstanding, easy, fun, DELICIOUS food producing cookbook!Our first Rachel Ray cookbook, but it won't be our last!"
2,30 minutes?,"I was really disappointed by this book. I like Rachael Ray and her 30 minute meals cooking show. Although on her show even I feel like a lot of her meals are shortened by pre prepared ingredients (pre cut, washed ready to go). It isn't that her food doesn't taste good but I want something that truly takes as little time as possible, as little cleanup and is inexpensive to purchase the ingredients. If you open this book you will quickly see that just the list of ingredients needed for each recipe is daunting to say the least. I love to cook and its one thing I can honestly say I'm really good at but I can come up with faster recipes that are just as good, with half the ingredient and no I do not use pre made ingredients and rarely pre prepared stuff except for things like already shredded cheese. I also really dislike the lack of pictures as well. It's fun and more appealing to see what you are going to cook."
1,Too complicated - unrealistic,"I like Rachael Ray on TV so I bought this book to add some pizazz to our dinners. Well, they're too exotic, too ingredient ladened to get me cookin'. And to top it off, the first (one & only) recipe I tried had you toast some hazelnuts & then doesn't tell you where to use them! Incomplete directions. I would NOT buy this book again!"
3,"good, but repetitive in a weird way","from the title I thought wow no repeats this will be great, which is kind of true. There are no recipe repeats, but some are slightly modified ie. 3 different ways to do macaroni and cheese etc. so I suppose I had thought it would've been more like no repeats as in not very similar recipes, but I was still happy with my purchase, just felt like the title was misleading."
2,"Great title, mediocre recipes","Lured by the promise of so many meals, I bought this book, which is, I admit, nicely produced though weak on real substance. Some good or very good recipes, but many others that are so familiar you don't need to write them down or others that no one would really cook. In the end I simply selected 7-8 recipes to ty. And that was all."
4,Great food but the book itself is cheaply made,"This may sound nitpicky but as much as I love the recipes I have tried from this book, the book is already falling apart. The picture pages were the first to separate from the binding and now the pages are too. Such a shame..."
2,not like the TV show,"I watch the TV shows and thought these books would be great but was truely dissappointed. There are a few pages of photos of the finished recipes, I really find the pic is what inspires you the cook the recipe. Most recipes were using the same ingredients. The recipes are not located in easy to find sections, such as burgers, salads."
1,Disappointed,"This is a cookbook for novice chefs, and those who are not used to cooking dinner on a regular basis. It has some good ideas, but most I have had to modify. If you are experienced at all in the kitchen, you will recognize that there are no creative or new ideas here, just take offs on the usual dinner ideas. In addition, there are too many ingredients for such simple recipes. There are many other cookbooks out right now with simple and more sophisticated easy menu ideas. I have donated my copy of this book to good will."
4,Delish,The book is great...already familiar with her stuff...Half the battle is having the necessary ingredients on hand...her recipes are pretty basic...I look forward to trying some new stuff.
2,Not a typical family recipe book,"This book is not for your everyday family. The recipes often require costly ingrediants that most families can not afford. Great book for special occassions, however the 365 days a year would significantly increase your grocery bill well above the average families budget. Swordfish isn't always found at your local grocery store."
3,"Pretty good, nothing to write home about.","I find Rachel Ray incredibly annoying to watch on television, but all my girlfriends rave on how easy and straightforward her cooking is. So, I picked up this book thinking it would have a variety of good, easy, quick recipes. There are a good variety of recipes in this book! Unfortunately, I was disappointed that quite a few were not really repeats, but a slightly modified version of the same.Another beef that I had with this were that the recipes didn't really take me only 30 minutes start to finish. More like 45 minutes to an hour because of all the chopping and prep work. Still, not too terrible since the food is better than eating a prepared meal or fast food.It's a good book, but it could have used a little more work."
4,Yummm-o!,"I just bought this book a couple of weeks ago; my first of Rachael's. Every recipe I have made so far is absolutely delicious. I gave this four stars, however, because these ARE NOT 30 minute meals. As one reviewer said, most of us do not have Food Network asistants who already have our veggies and prep work all done for us. These recipes take me about an hour to cook, but they are well worth it. I would recommend this cookbook for a novice cook who wants yummy food that is not your everyday doldrums. Even experienced chefs will find this a very good cookbook."
2,Disappointed,I love the TV program...thought the book would be as good...not the case...I was disappointed. Format was difficult to follow...and I would have liked to have had some additional pictures of the meals. If I had seen the book before I would not have bought it.
5,5-Star Meal,"I am the lucky recipient of a 5-star meal made from this book. After having given this book to a very dear friend as a birthday gift, I was rewarded at the end of a 10-hour work day with the salmon and black bean salad, which, I can say with conviction, put to shame any and all of the many gourmet meals I have indulged in over the years. Thank you, Rachel, for inspiring those gifted with culinary talent and a desire to share their good fortune."
1,Nothing exciting,"I really looked forward to this cookbook when I ordered it, but I was really disappointed with it. I haven't found anything that sounds good in the entire cookbook.If you want recipes search for them online. Don't waste your $$ buying this cookbook."
4,Rachael's Best,"This was is my all time book by Rachael Ray. The recipes were easy to understand and ingredients were already in my pantry. You can discover her fun and bright personality in this book. Although there should be more pictures, I highly recommend this cookbook."
3,Good for people who want tons of basic american recipes,"I wanted to learn the basics of creating various types of dishes, as I like to use my own creativity to make food to my personal taste. Now that's not to say that Rachael has poor taste, but this is basically a recipe book, not a cookbook if that makes any sense. I purchase this because it seemed to be loaded with tons of recipes and had good reviews, but personally, I like to learn the basics of things, like creating sauces, how to best prepare certain meats, how to properly bake certain items.. and then create my own. ""Cooking"" by James Peterson does this very well, go buy that if your brain works like mine.I should have known better, but I bought this and ended up selling it on eBay to avoid paying return shipping."
2,"Tasty, but not healthy","I was a bit disappointed with this book. Here is a list of what I liked and disliked about the book:Likes:1. Variery of recipes (although I do wish it had a few more vegetarian options).2. Everything I have made so far (10 recipes or so) tasted GREAT.Dislikes:1. My biggest diappointment is that the recipes are far from healthy. Every recipe I tried included A LOT of butter, and chicken or fish was always to be breaded. I am definitely not a healthy food snob, but there were several instances where I thought the recipe would have been just as good without 6 Tbsp of butter (and I did alter the recipes myself to make them healthier).2. All of the recipes I have tried so far have taken longer than 30 minutes (ranging from 40 to 60 or so), although I have to admit that I am not a very fast cook.3. The book would have been ideal as a spiral-bound publication. Since there are 365 recipes, the book is very thick and impossible to keep open while you are cooking."
3,"Good, but not great","I have Ms Rays Express lane meals and use it several times a week, but I have yet to pick a recipe to try out of this one. I do not like the format at all. Also, in express lane meals, most of the recipes are set up so you have a balanced meal, (protein, veggies, healthy fats and carbs), just like her origonal 30 minute meals cookbooks. This book is just not user friendly in my opinion.What I do like about most of her recipes, is we have yet to make a meal that didn't actually get us 2-3 days worth of food. She says they only serve 4, but we get double that. Maybe we are just not big eaters, but it makes spending the money worth it when we can stretch out her meals like we do.But over all, not too happy with this book. I will keep it around and keep looking through it anyway. Just maybe someday something will stand out and I will make it, but for now, I will keep express lane meals handy and within reach."
4,Great Ideas for quick and healthy meals,This cookbook is great for easy meals made with fresh ingredients. Its also great becasue the recepies are easy to alter to accomodate picky eaters.
3,Random but nice,"These recipes are okay for those new to cooking for family dinner. One recipe can turn into three with some slight modifications. The ingredients are easy to obtain. The format of the book is a bit random, not the usual cookbook format. Makes it more difficult to use sometimes."
4,Good Tasting!,"I've really enjoyed using this cookbook from Rachael Ray. The recipes really happen fairly quickly, are easier than I thought, and taste good! The only thing I wish that was in the cookbook was desserts and appetizers to make the dinners more complete. Other than that tiny aspect, I love it! I definitely recommend it for those with little cooking experience. I never cook and am able to make these meal with only minor upsets!"
3,Just need a little more,photos and descriptions of the sample art are wonderful - very inspiring. and very frustrating - diagrams or pictures of the felting process would be helpful. I just can't envision what is being described but I guess I just need to leap on in...
3,Needs some cosmetic improvement,"My 4-year old got this doll for Christmas. In my opinion, the concept is wonderful. My 4 year old had a wonderful time playing with her, and it seems like she says something different every time. We had no problems with the set-up and she had no problems understanding what my daughter was saying. Once I taught my daughter how to play with her, she loved it. The doll is totally interactive and very intelligent, and we had no problems with the inner workings.My only complaint is the way it looks. The color is not good for an ethnic doll. She almost looks ill. Has a green hue. After 3 days of moderate play, I did notice that there is some peeling around her lips. I'm not sure how the doll is going to hold up in the long run, but I guess we'll see."
2,"Poor Design,",The doll is awsome because she talks to your child and responses to her but the mouth on our doll started peeling off after the first day we had her because of the feeding her.and she keeps saying please same my name amanda. So i would not recommend this doll. For the money it isnt worth it. my daughter says she is annoying and keeps asking please shut her off.
1,Amazing Amanda is amazingly difficult.,"Amazing Amanda does not recoignize my daughter's voice. She also needs new batteries every couple of days. She doesn't give my daughter time to complete the tasks, such as feeding, before she has moved on. We do not like this toy, especcially for 100 bucks. My daughter has more fun with a five dollar baby doll that uses her own imagination."
3,It ain't all that!!!!,"My 8 year old was DYING to have this doll, bought it and she looks like a ASHY ethnic doll (not cute like the picture online). Amanda gets kinda confused with some things and she doesn't hear too well unless you yell at her, The whole potty thing is funny(she makes a pooping sound and the turd falls)now that is funny. The facial expressions are .. well.. different. My daughter LIKES her, we dont play with her everyday, she's kinda annoying after a while, oh! she wakes us up about 1 hour late! Pretty scary to wake up to that voice every morning. I think she should be on clearance now....about $19.99. So somebody owes me some MONEY!!!!"
5,My little girl is thrilled with Amazing Amanda,We have both the caucasian and the ethnic versions of Amazing Amanda and my daughters really love them. So far they have held up well. My 6 year old daughter is thrilled with how Amanda interacts with her..
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY,I BOUGHT THIS AS A CHRISTMAS PRESENT FOR MY DAUGHTER. BOY WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY. I LIKE ANOTHER MOM HAD TO GO INTO MY BATHROOM AND PROGRAM HER. MY DAUGHTER HAS TO SCREAM AT THE DOLL AND THE DOLL STILL DOESNT FOLLOW DIRECTIONS AS A RESULT MY DAUGHTER DOESNT EVEN PAY ATTENTION TO THIS THING. SHE DOESNT DO OR SAY MUCH. I THINK SHE HAS LIKE 10-15 PHRASES INCLUDING THE 4 SONGS SHE SINGS. NOT WORK 100 DOLLARS I PAYED AT ALL
4,Very handy,"This book covers a lot of nice material. I find myself referencing it all the time. Just about anything you'd want to do with javascript / HTML is here.However, this book is not for the javascript novice. It also, is NOT a javascript tutorial by any means. In addition, a complaint I had is that the code isn't on a Cd, you have to download it from their site. Also, the routines they use to manipulate objects are wrapped in their javascript code and it appears what they are calling, is native javascript code. This was unnverving until I figured out you had to include a 30K include file. I also found some of the examples didn't run nicely on all browsers (not surprising with DHTML).However, this book does cover a lot of ground and prepares the developer for the arduous task of creating DHTML pages. They do some very cool things with it and it is worth checking out."
3,Good for beginners,"This book is a good place to start for beginners or non-programmers. The coding examples are good only if you are going to use their wrapper code to build your DHTML. Being a programmer myself, I need to know how things work and just can't rely on someone else's code to magically do it for me. So, if you're looking for a quick way to get into DHTML this is the way to go. If you're looking for the ""guts"", this isn't the place."
2,What a nice paperweight!,"Be wary of any DHTML book that starts off with a chapter called ""what is a user interface?"" or one that starts off with 15 pages of descriptions & screenshots of UNIX commands. While the authors might have some qualified insight into GUI design with DHTML, most of it is hidden behind pages and pages of irrelevent filler. - It makes a great paperweight, but I'd hate to have to read it!"
2,"A ""Boxy"" Performance","Taking Stephen Foster's music out of the parlor and into the concert hall is not a new idea but here it just does not work. Jeffrey Dooley, a noted countertenor whose repertoire includes the works of Handel and Purcell, composers whose music responds to countertenors with excellent effect, renders a performance here that sounds like it was recorded inside a box, resulting in a high-pitched echo that hurt my ears and made it difficult to follow the lyrics of the songs. I gave this recording two stars because the instrumentals are quite good."
4,The complete story.,"I've read six books on the Constanzo Cult killings and this one offers the most complete account of not only the gory events at the shack but it also offers some idea what made it all happen, such as what part Aldolfo's mother, smuggling, cultural differences and international politics played in the whole affair.I'd also like to say that this story is extremely horrifying the way it really happened, so I wonder why it is that the numerous movies about the killings which claim to be ""Based on a true story"" are all so wildly different than the real true story. These movies are insulting to anyone who knows the real truth. Should anyone ever make a movie that ACCURATELY depicts the real story of the Matamoros Cult Killings, it would be far scarier than ANY so called horror movie ever made."
5,Maximum Louie Louie!,"One sign of a great song is that it can be successfully performed by different performers in wildly divergent styles. This collection demonstrates that Louie Louie is one such song. Take what I think are the three best versions on this collection: the Sonics, the Sandpipers, and Black Flag. First, the Sonics version is pure, rough garage rock, which sounds as fresh now as it did in 1967, when the song first appeared on the album The Sonics Boom. Next, the beautiful a capella version by the Sandpipers -- in Spanish! -- makes the song sound like a lullabye. Finally, the song sounds amazing as hard core punk by Black Flag. These versions alone make this collection worth owning, but all the others are great as well.If Louie Louie is one of your favorite songs, OR if you consider yourself a music fan, you should pick this one up."
2,"The ultimate rip-off, no wonder it's out-of-print","It's unusual for Rhino to offer such a meager amount of music. At 23:46 it's the worst value I've ever seen. Also, the liner notes trace the history of Louie, Louie but never mention any of the versions on the CD--no recording dates or anything.""Love That Louie"" has 24 songs and is still in-print. It also includes much better versions of the song such as that done by Toots & The Maytals and The Raiders."
2,"Stop everything, something is not feeling right","A friend of mine burnt me this cd. He wouldn't tell me who the aritst was or the name of the album. So, I put it in my player and listened to it. I thought to myself 'this is pretty good, but where have I heard this guy's voice before?'. When my friend told me it was Limp Bizkit, I was shocked for many reasons. 1) I couldn't even recognize Fred's voice on the album (I am a bizkit fan) 2) it sounded like a knock off of Rage Against the Machine 3) it was only half an album and 4) it sounded absolutley nothing like Bizkit. This is definetly going to be the fall of Bizkit. If you've been a Bizkit fan for a long time, be ready to be dissapointed."
2,this my first disappointment from LB...,"after looking forward to this CD a long time, THIS is waht they kome up with?? im sorry but this just wasnt waht i was hoping for. this album sounds very much like rage against the machine, and tho ratm is one of the best bands, it just doesnt work here. i have to say all of the songs sound unoriginal and boring, and this is really the first time i have ever been disappointed with limp bizkit. the only song i found to be better than the rest, but not by much was the last one, ""the surrender"". there are no songs which stand out and leave an impakt, like ""hot dog"" on choklate starfish, or ""faith"" on their first album. but, bands change, some fans go for the change, others kant keep with it. just a few more original and different sounding tracks would have mad me give this 4 stars instead of 2. i wouldnt reccomend this album."
2,okay i guess...,"okay, this cd is okay, not better not worse. the music was awesome, but Fred Durst was 'terrible"", he sang with the same tone in every song. the only song which i really really like is The Story, good music and i guess Fred was good. my fav cd is still Significant Other no matter wat. i really hope part 2 will be better, big dissapointment, i really thought with Wes Borland back it would work out better than Results May Vary, even tho that cd is good.I guess not"
1,"sorry, not what i expected!!!","yep, listed to this cd and was very disappointed...i was hoping more on the lines of 3db, but i was wrong...the vocals are more like a mellow R.A.T.M meets a dictionary...the lyrics and choice of words suck...maybe if fred added some screaming to it, i would enjoy it better...."
2,Really not what it use to be,I was really disappointed by these 7 songs. I doesn't seem like they really put the extra effort to create this. The beats are good but the vocals are totally not going with the music. Hope that Part 2 will be better.
2,2 good songs EP!!!,"Half of UNQUESTIONABLE TRUTH are really good, some of the best by LIMP BIZKIT...The PROPAGANDA, The TRUTH and The Story are decent heavy songs with decent Fred lyrics...But the other 3 of this EP are really nothing special...I give it 2 stars for 3 good songs, but argue with Fred's lyrics is really hard!!!"
3,Wes is back thank God!,"The music on this album rocks. Even Fred is at his best lyrically (please note...best still does not mean good). BUT...I think this band would be wonderful with a new singer and a new name. Limp Bizkit's music has alway been outstanding from day one, but it's always been overshadowed with all of the curse-words and yeeeah's from Mr. Durst. Who knows what this band could create with his absence. Rap-rock/Nu-metal has gone it's course and is dead. Fred should just chill with his buddy Hugh Hefner at the mansion and let the musicians carry on with dignity."
2,"Limp Bizkit, I Love Rage Against The Machine, too, but...","...you're not going to be the reincarnation of them, and this album sounds like they tried to do exactly that, channel RATM. The music sounds like RATM's, save the Morello solos, and Durst seems to do a sub-par impression of De La Rocha, both in voice sound and lyrics (like I said, sub-par). I don't know, this would be a pretty decent album if it were a local teenage band who touted themselves as the next Rage, but just sad for an already dead band such as limp."
3,Not what I was hoping for,I thought wes was back? The only real sounding evidenc to me was on the song the truth...the rest kinda i dont know...
1,crap...,"let's get this straight right now. one of the reasons as to why limp bizkit has lasted longer than guns and roses is because idiots like lobster leno would rather listen to sell-out corporate crap like limp bizkit. and calling fred durst ""consistent"" and ""talented"" only shows how much you DON'T know about good music. limp bizkit only stay true to idiots like lobster leno because limp bizkit knows lobster leno and his fellow morons will follow limp bizkit to the ends of the earth, even though their music is terrible."
4,A lot better than RMV,Wes is back! This CD is a lot darker than bizkit of old. I like it..maybe you will to..try it out
1,rubbish,"Just more proof that a big chuck of modern rock is justfor nerds and teenage high school outcasts. It doesn'tget anymore patheic than Fred Durst. He is supposed tobe a rock star, but the loser can't even get any chickhe wants."
1,Wow does this suck!!,"I AM a Limp Bizkit fan. I wan't crazy about Three Dolla Bill but everything else of theirs I loved. Even though I was dissapointed when Wes left the band, I though the new guitarist brought a lot to the band. Great hooks, a lot of melody and while Fred is not the greatest singer, I thought he was very good on Results may vary. So when I heard Wes was back and a new cd was coming out I was psyched. What a huge dissapointment!! I'm actually glad the torture only lasted a half hour. While their were some cool riffs, the melodies were completely gone and Fred was only doing what I call his ""yodel rap"" and poorly. If this is how they hope to last in the music scene today, say goodbye. It reminds me of how lousy it was to hear St. Anger after waiting so long for a new Metallica. Save your money"
2,where did they go too,Where did these guys go too. O my god its like they lost all of there musical talant...they should of stuck with the way they were musicly and lyricly. They sing about bulls**t and it sounds like the other band menbers dont know what's going on...I think the best album is there first album(three dollar bill yall). Pure talant but thats my opion........Peace
3,Without Fred things could be GREAT!,"I was pretty excited when I heard Wes was back in the band, for one simple reason... he is God at guitar. When I heard The Truth I was even more excited to hear the album because it is one kick ass song. However when I heard the whole CD I found myself wanting to kick Durst in his face for his weak and meaningless lyrics and vocals. Overall the album is sub-par, it is worth a listen, but don't expect alot out of Durst. Rivers, Borland and Otto are all back at it but Fred is still sucking it up.Do not buy this album in hopes of anything near the greatness of Three Dollar Bill Y'all, it's more like somewhere in between Chacolate Starfish and Results May Very"
1,Unquestionable Garbage,"Please don't make the same mistake i did and waiste your money on this cd. If you think that this cd is going to be anything like three dollar bill, then don't buy it. I gave up on Limp when hot dog flavored whatever came out and thought that with Ross Robinson producing this new cd and with Wes back that they might try to do something good again.. Fred couldn't write good lyrics if his life depended on it. I used to be a huge fan before Faith even came out and i though Limp had a lot of potential. Unfortunately it is never going to happen again. I read other peoples reviews on here before purchasing and heard comparisons to tool, 311 and rage. People comparing it to tool and 311 must have been on heroin because it is nowhere near that.And despite Freds attempt at sounding like Rage on the Truth, it doesn't carry over to the other tracks. Save your money and spend it on System of a Down in two weeks..."
1,Good Bye Nu Metal! I Spit On Your Grave!,"Wow, Limp Bizkit have a new album. who knew!? I listened to samples on itunes and downloaded a few songs off lime wire. It sounds like their trying to cement themselfs as the new Rage Against The Machine. But It won't happen because that band had talent! Wes is a cool guy, but a mediocore as all hell guitarist. Fred! Your 15 Minutes are up! throw in the towel, Nu Metal is dead!"
5,Let Me Help You,Oh poor u guys.....There! I just gave u 5 stars. I think thats fair cause I havent even listened to the album yet....ha ...ha!
3,Much harder!,"First off, for those people who keep comparing the new Limp Bizkit sound to Rage Against the Machine are off their rockers! Although this is one of Limp's harder albums, I just don't see them as having the same sound as Rage. This album is closer to metal than to anything that they, or Rage have done before.I like this album for the sole reason that it is very un-Limp Bizkit like - it's much harder, and not as ""poppy"". For the price, it's a decent buy, and as a person who is not the biggest of Limp Bikit fans, I certainly enjoyed it!"
3,Stuck Mojo in disguise.....,"Hard to top the last review. This is defiantely ""angry rap rock"", which they excelled at previously. The thing I liked about them ""back in the day"" was that they had a sense of humor, it seemed like they did not take themselves that seriously. This disc is very dark,if you like Stuck Mojo, Orange 9MM, etc, you'll love this. Wes's guitar playing is killer. No ""shouts out to Ben Stiller"" on this one. They certainly will never rule the world again, but it will be interesting to see if they can live with the ""has been"" status, yet still try to make interesting music. Kind of cant wait for part 2...."
3,A good start to something possibly good.,"This album in no way is revolutionary for music (it has been done much better by Rage), but it is a nice step for Limp Bizkit. I admit that I enjoyed the band more when Wes was not in it (Results May Vary), but this is a nice effort to head in a different direction (better than Sugar Ray's change of direction from Floored to 14:59 - what the heck was that?). A lot of the riffs sound like Metallica's St. Anger, which is a piece of crap, but Bizkit is more creative with it. (...)"
1,This record proves...,"...that Fred durst has a crush on Zack de la Rocha and Chino Moreno.He was rejected by both,so he made this record instead,to try and win the hearts of their loyal fans.That didn't work either..."
1,Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha hah ahahahahhahah!!!!!!!!,"The only thing that is unquestionable about Limp Bizkit is that they are the worst and most cringing band ever! Fredy oh fredy, seriously man your lyrics sound like my 3rd grade brother who also has down syndrome wrote them. Please dont ever say that you want to sound like Rage ever again, its like Hitler saying he wants to be god. ha ha ha you guys really suck!!! terrible album, maybe the worst in history. Cool album cover though, I guess. Really original message. Maybe ask Maynard if he can teach you how to not suck at life. ha ha"
1,7 songs?,"what is this garbage? who do these guys think they are, rage against the machine? i dont even know what to think about these guys anymore, they seriously get worse with every album. when did the last album come out, 2003? so it took them 2 years to bang out 7 songs for an album? thats alot of time to work on an album. one of the songs (the key) isnt hardly even a song, and its like a minute and half long... and whats with the ""the"" titles for each songs. thats so lame. a 7 song cd like this should only be like $5.99, not full price... this isnt really something to call an ""album"". so i guess this is part 1, with 7 songs on it, so in like 2 years part 2 will come out, with another lame 7 songs? come on now. i dont know what fred durst can possibly do anymore to make people like him again. maybe he'll go solo, haha."
1,Why did Limp Bizkit release another album?,"Before I get to the review, I have one thing to say and that is: ""Fred Dursts Numba One Fann, please shut the **** up and another thing, please stop with that damn hip-hop speak.""Anyway, the world's most hated vocalist, Fred Durst, decided to force his band to release another album, and If Zack from Rage Against The Machine ever finds this, he would sue Fred's ass off. I mean if I wanted to listen to Rage Against the Machine, then I would actually listen to Rage Against the Machine. For everyone else who wants good music to listen to besides Rage, go out and buy Tomorrow Come Today by Boysetsfire, or any album by any band that I mention in my Good Charlotte Review, and for good or at least decent Nu-Metal, listen to Taproot."
1,Unquestionable Crap,Let's just put it like this: I'd rather get kicked in the sack than listen to this crap.When will this stupid band learn to stop putting out albums and commit suicide?
4,strong effort,"I've listened to Limp Bizkit since the beginning days when they were a big part of getting the rap metal sound going. This album to me is another step in their progression as a band. I know many people out there love to diss Limp Bizkit which is fine if that's your thing. But these are the same people who would never admit to Limp Bizkit actually making a good cd again. I picked up this cd with an open mind and gave it a straight through listen. Overall, I say it's a solid cd that holds your interest thoroughout. The only downside is the length of the cd but its the quality that reallys counts."
1,"1 word, multiple times","Horrible, Horrible, Horrible, Horrible......This cd is audio diarrhea. I was excited about Wes's return, but this is just horrible."
1,RIP Limp Bizkit,"This was the first CD I have ever bought that I honestly regret buying. I wasted my money on this one. Every song is the exact same, with Fred writing even crappier lyrics. If you like limp, Chocolate Starfish was their best album. Do not buy this one. Limp Bizkit is dead."
3,3 Stars due to only seven tracks,"I feel like Limp Bizkit could have put out one full length album instead of this. However, I like the songs here a lot. Most of the tracks are a lot different from Limp Bizkits prior albums. DJ Lethal is barely noticeable on this album. Anyway the seven tracks makes you crave more. The album is way too short. So it is only rewarded three stars."
1,No.,Listen to their CD - Chocolate Starfish And The hotdog flavored water -- more enjoyable by far --this is only 30 minuites long!
1,Don't Waste Your Money On This One!,"What a bunch of crap! Limp Bizkit is a talented band, hindered by Fred Durst's lack of vocal ability. This group is a sinking ship, with Fred Durst as their anchor."
2,Sellout,"I liked ""Chocolate Starfish.."" which was in fact a very good record worth listening and it did succeed well too. But since then God know what happened to LB. In Unquestionable Truth (pt.1) Fred's singing and 'rapping' not only sucks but his voice got more whiney. The lyrics are dumber then any other mainstream hiphop crap that's played on the mainstream and despite sucky efforts in the name of 'music' it somehow sells millions of copies thanks to the retarded audience population.If you really like music then listen to some heavier stuff. Even if you find the vocals of a metal/hardcore band difficult to understand, read the lyrics which are at least meaningful and something you can relate to.Limb Bizkit's days are over. It's time to move on."
4,gotten it back,"well, with there first 3 albums, they put limp bizkit ont he charts, readying up there fans, making honest music. but then, the worst happened, results may vary came into the picture, and totally made them into the most hated band of all time.but then they put out htis piece of work. they added guitar solos and catcy rifts. they made it hard and heavy. the bizkit empire came around. they are back, heavier then ever.now, the title song, the truth, is awesome. they added a huge solo int he begining of the song. they made it heavy. they put there 4 most best songs on the front of the cd then gradullay decreased fromt here.i like this album, but am displeased about its lengh and the 1 minit song.."
1,Pitiful,"What a waste of cash. I do not hate Limp Bizkit, I used to be fan. I was out buying the new NIN cd and saw this and thought that they might go back to the tried and true sound, but the cd sounds half-(...). At least their old stuff was good old angry, stupid rock. What the hell is this junk suppossed to be? Kind of makes you wonder if their contract included just one more album. What a waste of a cd. I just hope that there will not be a part 2. It's one thing to waste money on a steaming pile of (...), but it at least better be the full pile of (...) and not part one of more (...). Do not buy this cd!"
1,"Simply put, it SUCKS!!!","I didn't even know they released another album until it popped up on my launch cast station on yahoo. I feel like I've been let down. I mean, the last few LP's they have released have been hot!!! It seems like they fumbled the ball on the 2 yard line with this one. The beats are whack and I found myself getting bored listening to it. Im an avid Limp Bizkit fan but this is one album I wouldn't get even if it was on bootleg for $1.50"
1,Backgrouds are great but poor lyrics and poor vocals,This is garbage. The vocals are so bad they wreck every song on this. By the Way Rage wants there sound back
5,What's all the fuss?!,"I LOVE this album. I think Limp Bizkit is wonderfully talented and this CD reflects their talent (edgy lyrics and great music). I understand the negative reviews, I suppose, but really they are a little over the top, in my humble opinion. Are we even talking about the same album? Limp Bizkit is about music, and they do a great job at it. Good guitarist... great... lyrics... edgy.... loud.... pumped.... shocking... OK I'm done, that's all I have to say. If you like Limp Bizkit, you'll like this album. If you want to talk about world peace and quantum physics or whatever the heck these other reviewers are talking about, that's a different story. Give me a break! This isn't rocket science. It's about ROCKING LYRICS AND DISTURBINGLY GREAT SOUND! ... doesn't hurt to make people think a little for themselves once in a while! Or maybe it does. Perhaps that's why the reviewers are being so negative."
1,WHY.,This album is about as good as passing a kidney stone the size of a basketball. Just take that 11.99 and buy yourself a couple of porno magazines at your local adult store.
1,Sucks worse than any other CD I've bought in five years,"My title says it all, don't waste your money."
1,Should be called the unanswered garbage.,"The Unquestionable truth part 1 is the worst album I've seen from the worst bands ever since warrant, their music is stupid, hopeless, songs are bad, the musicians are horrible, the lyrics look stupid and fred durst maybe the worst frontman of all time.This was the G-Unit of rap rock.One of the year's worst albums.The Unquestionable truth is unquestionably awful.Thumbs Way Down for Me."
1,Sad & Illiterate Rip-off Zack de la Rocha,"This EP is just terrible. Terrible, terrible, terrible. Fred Durst flexes like a Rage member without the vocabulary. When will he learn that he just can't write lyrics. This is revolution Urban Outfitter-style, yet not cool enough to get played in one of their stores. Painful to listen to. Forgotten in a week. He should have just stuck to what he knew - repetition of references to himself, his band (""we're Limp Bizkit"") and oh yes---the nookie."
1,HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA,"Does this man understand that he is THE worst musician mainstream music has seen to date? He can't even TRY to do hardcore right. I never heard any breakdowns, pretty much the most simple aspect of hardcore. Limp Bizkit and Fred Durst, suck now and always have. All of the songs sound the same, and there is no intricacy to any of his music in the least bit. Yet I see various comparisons to Rage Against The Machine and Nine Inch Nails, two bands who are actually genius. It is pathetic that any record company would even give this guy a contract. It is obvious that he either can't make real music, or he can't stand losing all of his pre-pubecent fans and going to some sort of real genre. either way, he isn't making as much money as he used to. This is a pathetic excuse for a cd and an band."
1,Limp Bizkit sucks,"Honestly, does anybody even give a s**t anymore? I have made fun of this manufactured, no talent, washed up, pathetic excuse of humans band enough, and saying something would be like me repeating fourty things about this band over and over...Conclusion: This is crap!"
3,is it LB or RATM?,"I keep listening and i dont hear LP's slyle anywhere in this album...what happened? we will never know for sure...but the more I listen to it, the more I like Rage against the machine.3 stars...its not that is bad, it's that is not Limp Bizkit."
3,The Unquestionable Let Down,Wow what a let down limp bizkit needed a big cd and this did not cut it fred durst is not so good on this album he needs to go back to the 3 dollar bill yall - Chocolate Starfish days when limp bizkit was worth a damn or they need to get a new lead singer
3,Why not longer?,"I've been waiting for awhile for LB to put a new album out because RMV sucked. Now that they have, I think they should've waited. The album is waaaaay to short. The music is good and Wes has recharged the sound, but waaaay to short."
1,A DEFINATE SKIPPER!!!!!,"LIMP BIZKIT have gone Limp! They cant write a good song to save their soul. 7 songs isn't an album(really only 6), don't waste your money on this Sh*t record, if you fools would stop buying this, they would realize they need to change. Get the new Still Remains cd or NIN, both much better than this. WAKE UP!"
1,the unquestionable truth is...this album really sucks,"what a huge disappointment.i have been a LB fan since before their first album was released. i never became a fred hater. ""results my vary"" even really grew on me. when i heard wes was coming back, i was like, ""wow, this could be huge.""NOPE..IT JUST SUCKS.wes has a few good riffs, but his return is a major letdown. the entire band as a whole just sounds like a mess. and yea, the rumors are true, FRED SOUNDS LIKE A WANNABE ZACK DE LA ROCHA!i just went through this track by track waiting to hear a song i like, BUT THERE JUST ARE NONE!and to top it off, THERE ARE ONLY 7 SONGS ON THIS ALBUM!!! AND ONE TRACK IS LIKE 1:30 OF NONSENSE.i relate this to metallica's ""st. anger"" album. they're trying too hard to be original and it just really sucks.i rate it a very limp 1 out of 5."
1,POLL,"The real unquestionable truth is that limp bizkit sucks...im just trying to survey people, just for the hell of it. Click yes, if not....im sorry to tell you you were born without a brain and listin to horrible music."
2,Washed up,"Some bands can continue to make great music some simply cannot. Limp Bizkit cannot. This album sounds thrown together, and hearing Freds mental break downs in every single song is just not worth listening to, im sorry but I cannot relate to a depressed multi-million dollar lead vocalist tool. I have a lot of respect for music in general and Limp Bizkit as artists (it doesn't seem like it, but lets be real), but there is no question they could have done better.Ill give it 2 stars for the effort."
1,Pt.1 does that mean there was gonna be a pt2!,"Limp Bizkit is in the toilet at the moment and its time there flushed down. They have lost all credibility, mainly fred durst. Well basically it's all Fred Durst's fault he brought the band down and i think the remaining members need to get out while they can."
1,Downhill Even Further.........,"Man, Just when you thought Limp Bizkit couldnt get any worse, they come out with this album, completely change their sound (and try to make themselves sound like Rage Against The Machine)and put out the worst album theyve done.Come on! A** kicking songs like break stuff, counterfeit, take a look around, nookie..... Thats when this band rocked.....THIS ALBUM SUCKSI wonder if Fred Durst is still walking around wearing baseball hats that bear his initials....."
1,"Sorry, But not what I want from them.","This album is so boring, I almost cried. I didn't think the last album was the end all be all either, but at least it had some catchy, smart ass songs on it. This sounds like second rate Rage against the Machine with a Queensryche Operation Mindcrime wanna be story.Sorry, I love all types of music, but I listened to this 3 times, and doubt I ever will again.Bring back the Nookie and Rollin. I want my Limp Bizkit fun to listen too."
2,"Unquestionable Garbage, Pt. 1","This cd sucks, even for LB. The irritating vocals of lead singer Fred Durst grow even more agitating on this disc as you would think a 30 some-odd year old man would stop rapping like a little kid whines. Still way better than Korn, but this puts the nail in the coffin...no wonder nu-metal is a dying breed."
2,Don't believe the Cover,"I brought the book with the belief that the pictures in the book would have more color. The only color in the book is black, white and red. The color pictures are on the CD. The book's graphics are HORRIBLE!!"
2,I don't think so.,"This book is a mixture of B&W photographs, 2-color diagrams and bad 3-D computer graphics. I didn't open the CD. Frank Netter's work is, in my opinion, very superior."
2,Less than expected,"If you're looking for a general overview of the role of creativity in education, or a justification of why educational systems (and broader social systems) should do more to promote creativity, then this book is for you. However, if you're looking for a ""how to"", i.e., a method for transforming education in order to better promote creativity, then this book will disappoint you."
3,Happy and sad,"As like other gun products you have to be careful as to make sure you get the correct product. I ordered the right part but I didn't anticipate the fact an owner before me had modified the gun so this didn't fit correctly, well the forward stock didn't... But it's a previous owner."
2,Warning,Be warned. The songs are not by familiar artists. You will know the songs but they just don't sound like the original.
4,Love That Jazz Man,"This is a very delectable sampling of many rockin' New Orleans Jazz flavored tunes. Some of the songs are performed by such rock n roll legends like Dr. John and The Neville Brothers. Others are from more soulful artists like Madri Gras Mambo by the Hawkettes. Sill others are percussion driven like Little Liza Jane and Meet De Boys On The Battlefront. And of course there are plenty of great brass and keyboard arrangements to keep any jazz fan happy.Whereas many of these artists were not legends in the annals of music history, their contributions to this disc are certainly very good. This is a very appropriate party tape for ayoung hip crowd especially if your are anywhere near the Bayou. Goes nice with some Crawfish, Jambalaya, and a beer or two."
3,Good for what it is..,"Okay, ordered this one on a whim. It's bigger than I expected, so I haven't used it very much. It is very soft and flexible though, and it transmits vibration very well. Just hold a bullet at the base and it's off to the races!"
3,A Little Limp,Product is nicely sized for a beginner but very difficult to initially insert due to being very soft and limp. Once it is in a few inches it works just fine. The nice part is that it does not intimidate your partner.
4,"Wrong Picture, What is Shown is 2007FP","The wrong picture is being shown. What is shown is the 2007FP, not the 2007WFP.The 2007FP is a 1600 x 1200 UXGA, 4:3 monitor, not a widescreen. The 2007WFP is widescreen 1680 x 1050.I bought a 2007FP as a spare, in case my Samsung 20 inch 4:3 1600 x 1200 monitors burn out, since 4:3 monitors are as rare as hen's teeth, and a 1200 vertical is rare.Besides Dell, only Eizo makes a 20/21 inch 4:3 monitor--and Eizo's, though great, are too expensive. If you want/appreciate a 4:3 with 1600 x 1200 resolution, then get the 2007FP. If you want a widescreen get this one.An alternative is the U2410 - 1920 x 1200 which is much better deal, and a great monitor--I have one too."
3,An excellent monitor!,"This monitor looks great and numerous inputs (HDMI, S-Video, etc) for whatever you might need it for. It has a good resolution and the image quality is excellent based on my experiences using the monitor with both a computer and a Playstation 3. The monitor does have a few drawbacks. The buttons used to change the input and settings of the monitor are setup in a way that makes it difficult to operate. Also, I experienced the occasional display error when using the monitor with my computer. However, despite these drawbacks, this monitor is an excellent buy for anyone in need of a computer monitor."
3,"pretty, but not a monitor for photo editing","After reading that these monitors were made by the same manufacturer that makes the Apple Cinema displays, I purchased this monitor to replace my dying CRT. While watching DVDs nice and widescreen was a pleasure, I quickly noticed some problems that led me to return the monitor and go back to the drawing board.The four corners of the monitor had bright spots like a light leak at each corner, and the contrast adjustments were insufficient to calibrate the monitor for photo editing, with shadows that were too dark. Reducing contrast so reduced the overall brightness that everything took on a grey muddy feel. After fiddling with it for a week, I returned the monitor and am back on the hunt.Loved the look, the swivel screen, controls were easy to figure out, screen was nice and sharp and color was tasty, but this is not a budget alternative to a higher end display for anyone interested it using it for photo editing."
5,Review for 2007FP,"I don't see the full-screen 2007FP on amazon... so I'm going to write the review here, on the widescreen product page.The 2007FP is an excellent monitor, I bought 2 directly from Dell and have them side-by-side on my desk. They are sleek, bright, crystal clear... I would recommend to just about anyone. If you're looking for something to play video games on, the ms response isn't the highest out there, but I do play xbox on one of them occasionally and I don't notice any problems with the display (some claim otherwise)UPDATEHere it is, 1.5 years later. This monitor seemed to be ahead of its time. The clarity, brightness and color are all great, even compared to this widescreen samsung monitor I got not too long ago."
4,"If you're aware of this album, you'll love it.","Awareness of Mark DeGliAntoni implies either a strong love for Soul Coughing or a strong love for experimental music that still has a beat and a tune (and sometimes - gasp - words!). Well, here we have a combination of art and sound that is well worth the two or three listens it takes to get your head around the album. As one who fits into the first of the two categories I mentioned above, I started to love this album upon hearing track 11 (you can practically hear Mike Doughty rasping prosaic poetry over the funky bass and drums) and went on from there. One of my most treasured and esoteric albums."
3,decent,"it's ok, the sound sucks, but it does keep it dry. IPOD touch doesn't fit, I wish they would have put that in the description. Eats batteries pretty quick. Overall pretty good for the price"
5,"One of the premier punk albums, ever...PERIOD!","My brother came home in 1979 with the ""Something that I said"" single (1.99 at Records on Wheels in '79, eh) and I was hooked. There was only one thing to do. I bought this album when it first came out as an import in Canada (yes! on vinyl). To this day it still stands as one of the best punk albums for that music era. Favourite songs include Babylons Burning, SUS, Something That I Said (of course), It Was Cold, and Jah War. I was so impressed with this band that I tried to buy everything they put out, up until Malcolm's death and the introduction of Ruts D.C. No offence, fellas, but that band just didn't have the sound or quality of the original Ruts. If you are looking for original Punk Rock, then buy this album. It is one of the best records to come out of the late 70's/early 80's Punk Rock period."
2,Not one of their best,I was disappointed when I listened to this album; it is not one of their best.
5,luvs it,"I love this dvd. Its great helping me physically as I work out very strenuously but the mental bit about how to deal with irritation has helped me even more. I find myself saying throughout the day ""be the space around the the irritation"" sooo good"
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"Good video. You never know when you try a new yoga video as there are some crazies out there. The narration was just right - good 'yoga voice' and just the combo of hatha & meditation I was looking for, with not too much talking yet enough to remind you of focusing on the breath, not judging yourself during the process (extraordinarily challenging for me), and being still.Why is it not a 5 star then? I really cannot fathom why Eckhart Tolle is doing the introduction in that strange halting style. He'd read a third of a sentence, wait five seconds, then another third, then 5 seconds, than another. It was so annoying that I eventually turned it off and fast forwarded to the start of practice."
5,The Best Yin Instruction Available!,"If you know Yin or are at least familiar with it and need a good instructional tape/DVD--this is the one! Kim's meditation and teaching technique is wonderful! You must keep in mind however, that YIN is quite different from most of the other forms of Yoga that are available to us. Yin is the holding of an asana/pose for minutes at a time, and all poses are on the floor. Typically you are holding for 3-5 minutes so that the fascia stretches and relaxes. This is definitely not for everyone/ It is challenging but also relaxing at the same time. The flexibility gained with this form of yoga is amazing! So there are advantages. It is a great addition to Hatha, and or Vinyasa."
3,Eh...,"I'm torn about this product. I enjoy the Dragon sequence. However, I find Kim Eng's facial expressions throughout most of the DVD to be a bit of a turn off. She rarely smiles. Sometimes during balancing poses like Airplace (or as Kim calls it, Dragon Soars) she's very shaky. The concept is great, I just wish it was better executed."
5,Truly a wonderful video,"This video was a great introduction to Yin yoga. Not only has my flexibility greatly improved, but also I have noticed increased feelings of calmness and balance, which is great for a mother of two little ones."
1,Angel costume,The costume came with a hole in the neck line. Did not have time to exchange. The Halo was made very cheap the band broke could not fix. The picture showed the item to be nicer then what is was. The price was right:)
4,Two great historical romances -- a nice find...,"Gifts of Love by Kay Hooper and Lisa Kleypas are two great Christmas Historical romance stories. Holiday Spirit by Kay Hooper's tells the story/mystery of two romances. The first couple broke their engagement over lies and the second couple are ghosts.... Surrender, Lisa Kleypas tells the story of conflict of Irish and aristocratic Bostonians. This story was a about married couple who had to grow into their love. A great stories anytime of the year. I love Kleypas but now I am off to find more by Hooper."
5,Great Book for Aikidoka,"This book contains terminology, pics and all those terms that sometimes you have heard at the dojo but were afraid to ask how to pronounce or write correctly. In addition it has the kanji for the terms, which helps a lot if you plan to travel to Japan to train- since not all dojo have terms spelled out in ""romaji."" I used it in order to prepare for a trip to train in Japan and found it invaluable. I highly recommend this book, whether you are a beginner or an advanced level student."
2,So much was left out...,"I am amazed by the five star rating for this book as the author left out so many terms that a true beginner would want and need to know. I was very disappointed with the severe limitation of this book. What happen to ""tenkan"", ""tenshin"", ""kaiten"", as an example, which is very basic and important foot work?I would not and do not recommend this book."
4,Good book.,The book was shipped quickly. The book was in good shape as advertised. I would buy from them again.
3,short shipment,We received the package but without the manual and the carry case. We sent in our complaint and request to have the manual and the carry case sent to our address urgently - till date no action..
5,Evaluation of the Sony VAIO VGN-FE77OG,"The laptop has performed well for travel and Power Point presentions. It has never crashed. I have some difficulty with the mouse area, but that can be resolved with the purchase of a wireless unit. Battery power seems adequate. I use the unit at home occasionally and with its wireless unit I am able to print off of three different printers."
3,canon G7 housing,The housing appears flimsy but allows access to all functions. However the housing partially blocks the internal flash which must be seen in order to fire any slave strobes as there is no way to sync with a cord.The photos appear soft for some reason which I suspect has to do with the housing. There is no wide angle attachment and the highest F stop for the camera is F8. I do not recommend this set up for scuba divers but it is OK for snorkeling photographers who are not serious photographers.
1,disappointing,The case seemed secure and watertight although I didn't ttake it in the water. When I tested the camera usinf the flash. there was a dark banner along the bottom of the picture.
3,Not the best but does the job,"I am a diver that's currently living in the Cayman Islands. I bought this case with my new Canon G7 just a few weeks ago. I've had a similar case for my older point and shoot. Basically, they work well but don't expect your photos to appear in national geographic any time soon... even with a good camera like the G7. To take good pictures underwater, you're going to need a proper strobe light otherwise your pictures will be washed out.So i would recomend this case for snorkling, protecting your camera in rain, beach, snow etc.... but it's not a serious underwater case. There are professional ones that are compatible with the G7 but they cost more than the camera without the storbes...One more thing to keep in mind that was disapointing about this case was that it did not control the scroll wheel which allows you to manipulate manual focus and lots of other useful controls.Hope this helps."
4,Compact case but missing a little something,"I just received this housing and gave it a test run a few days ago. Very compact design, with numerous buttons to control most of the functions on the G7. Front glass is very clear, photos and videos come out sharp and clear. One problem I found is you can not adjust the exposure compensation with the housing or for that matter any function with requires turning the dial on the back of the camera. The underwater photos that I took required about -2/3 to -1 stop of exposure. I could not change this while the camera was in the housing. I had to remove the camera from the housing then adjust the exposure then put the camera back in the housing."
5,good door chain,"this is just what i was looking for, work perfectly and nice pricedefinitely recommended door chain, I like the material, will last"
4,core workout,I am a personal trainer with most of my clients ranging from age 50 - 74. The soloflex enables me to work with specific areas of weakness for strenthening and flexability and my personal goals for pain reduction. Great product Thanks.....Kaye Jordan
4,Rattle my bones healthy--I hope,"Basically a mini-earthquake machine, that rattles the one on it--everything from a low buzz to a stronger rattle that makes me feel like my eyeballs are about to fall out if I'm watching the television. Said by some to help increase bone development--I got it for my pre-osteopenia (pre-osteopororis). Having not had a scan since, I don't know if it worked. But it is good for relaxation (just lay down on it and put on rattle, and zone)."
5,THE BEST,THIS IS A COOL PLAYER. IT IS VERY COMPACT AND EVEN HAS A RADIO. ON IT YOU CAN DOWNLOAD MP3S AND ALSO FORM CDS.
1,I-Jam not be jammin',"I-Jam started off to be a pretty cool little MP-3 player when I bought it a year ago. Last year I was thinking that MMC was going to take off and everyone would have 256mb MMC cards for $50 by now. Well, guess what!??! MMC didn't take off. You are lucky if you can find a 64mb MMC at a reasonable price. But oh wait - there's more. It seems with all the popular media formats (MP3, WMA, etc), the I-Jam isn't so flexible about reading. Now I can't even get three songs to play consistently on this beautiful red player. So now I am shopping for another mp3 player. On the bright side, it is small and the FM tuner works awesome! Three presets isn't enough, but still good enough to make it useful as something more than a small anchor for my aquarium."
3,"Good Player, but There are better players out there.","This is a pretty good player only problem is it has a VERY limited amount of memory. And thos little card thingies are expensive. The one line display is hard to read, and the parallel port drive is a hassle. Another piece of technno junk to clutter up your computer desk. I had mine fo about 4 months now, and it has been really good to me. Especially at school, its very tiny, and can be hidden very easily. The sound is AWESOME,and its pretty easy to use. But sooner or later, I'm going to hand it down to my sister, and buy a bigger, and better one."
3,I't work.,The part works just fine. But it looks different than the picture. the picture is of the old style and the one we got was the new style.
4,I'm impressed,"This is my first navigational system, and after doing research I thought it would best fit my needs. So far it has done the job - the screen is comfortable to view and I love the turn by turn directions. I was looking at other models and find this has a good combination of features. It is very easy to use - would recommend it.The only reason I am rating it 4 stars is because sometimes seems slow in acquiring my GPS location and when I am in a hurry, I don't have the time to wait."
4,Good value for the $$$,"The product has some very good features, but the written documentation is poorly written and incomplete. Acquiring the GPS signal takes too long if you are in a hurry and can't sit still. Not sure if I will keep it."
4,If you are going to read one Dicken's book...,"Although I initially had quite a struggle with Charles Dickens he has quite grown on me. By the time I got to this book I knew what to expect and consequently, I think, enjoyed it more than I normally would. This is one of the typical Dicken's books in my mind and is a pretty classic example of his writing style (follow one main character and many sub plots that all twist together by the end of the novel.) I really enjoyed trying to predict how people in the book would fit together and thought it was a rather charming little read. I don't think it will really stick with me as a book that ""changed my life"" but I'm glad I took the time to read it at least once."
3,Hard Times - Hard Reading,"I know it is a classic, but so is castor oil. I really appreciate it for the times in which it was written - and I can see parallels between the way children were treated then and how they are still treated in some sects today- but I cannot say I found it an enjoyable read. I prefer Dickens Tale of Two Cities, Great Expectations and Christmas Carol a lot more. Hard Times is not his best effort."
2,Hard times,"I have not finished this book - it has been hard to get into it. I do enjoy Dickens though, so I am going to keep at it. Not one of my favorites, though."
1,Hons and Rebs,"The delivery took much longer than necessary. I found 2 weeks for delivery unacceptable. The book arrived in acceptable condition, but clearly old and used."
4,"Hard Times, easy, rewarding read.","Over decades since college I've read and re-read my way through Dickens' masterworks while unnecessarily slighting ""Hard Times."" I enjoyed it at least as much as any of his pointedly social commentaries and much more than some (""Bleak House,"" for example). Dickens' fans know what to expect - when a character is good, their virtue is saintly, and when they are bad, they are horrid. Each reaches their apotheosis, damnation, or belated enlightenment, as their character deserves, making this a deliciously brisk Dickens read and perfect literary snack. There's nothing difficult about ""Hard Times,"" which makes it a delight."
4,Some things never change,"While some in my book group found this book difficult to get into, others were intrigued by the similarity of themes to contemporary times. Are we not concerned about those with rigid beliefs that defy understanding and who reject any attempt to reason? That would be the characters of Gradgrind and Bounderby. Do we not sympathize with workers subjected to inhumane conditions, miners, factory workers, particularly in foreign countries? That would be the workers in Coketown, Dickens' fictional setting for this novel. Labor vs. management, education as facts forced into children, love thwarted, parents who misunderstand children, people who spy on others, people stuck in their unfortunate circumstances, bad marriages, these are all interesting themes explored in this book, one of Dickens shorter novels. Give it a chance beyond the first 20 pages."
5,Non-stop action and Give me Errika Please!,"This is a page-turning first book that grips you from page one and doesn't let go until the end .... loved the female character, a wonderful blend of hormones and cool efficiency.There's a lot of Japanese culture in there and a pretty good view of what goes on behind the scenes in counter-intelligence. While not as detailed as a Tom Clancey novel, it reminds me of a Robert Ludlum or Nelson Demille book .... it's without-a-doubt a great read!"
5,Completely wonderful,I am completely delighted with every album that I have by Kate Rusby. Her voice is so easy to listen to and her songs are charming and wonderful.I would recommend her albums to anyone.
3,Five Stars?,"Five stars? These are all pretty songs, but I wouldn't say the album belongs in five-star territory; for the most part, you have to go over to Ireland for that. Not long ago I heard Kate perform in front of Altan, and one thing I couldn't help noticing was that Mairead, in addition to having a sharp Irish accent, also takes pains to sharply enunciate every syllable of the lyrics she sings. Kate's voice has a tendency to be suppressed in the instrumentals."
2,4 stars for the Colonel 0 stars for Elvis.,Nash does a much better job with Colnel Von Kujik than she does with The King. The book lacks the depth needed to be really compelling. Its matter of fact journalistic style falls short of prose and the perspective is too far removed from the subject to be insightful. So much retread grist from the mill about Elvis; very atypical portrait filled with more tales from the toilet and drug induced dimentia. This book would have been better served if she focused exclusively on the Colonel. The perfunctory way Nash deals with Elvis is boring and shallow. The best new book about Elvis is called AROUND ELVIS and you should read it if you want to read about the heart and soul of Elvis Presley.
4,Was the Colonel truly good for Elvis as a man?,"Truly this book has great research in it, and it is valuable as a resource for anyone seriously interested in Elvis. Tom Parker, no doubt, did something really bad in Holland (maybe murder) as he never even communicated with his family after the late 1930's. Parker also did possess a certain power over Elvis that probably depressed Elvis to some degree, and Elvis knew of some of Parker's gambling habits (as one can hear in the 9-2-74 closing show, for example), and Parker lost nearly 90 million dollars in gambling (as estimated). That is truly incredible, but this book doesn't speculate into the nefarious nature of these habits or analyze what drove Parker to gamble, and we may never know. For its reluctance to analyze, I give the book 4 stars instead of 5."
4,Cute Fun - Not excellent on a hot day,"This little novelty is a fun item for parties however if you are looking to have it outside on a summer party to keep the beverages cold, you would be best off with an ice cooler. This fridge is unable to compete with a really hot outside temperature. All in all though a fun item and my husband does love it."
5,Great Basic CD Deck,I first purchased this in High School for my Ford Ranger. Really enjoyed it b/c it was cutting edge back then. It can read mp3s off of CDs. I bought this again to replace my old one after my truck was broken into. Easy to install and easy to use.
2,"Drums, More Drums and Nothing But Drums!","This release is subtitled ""The Drumming of Michael Pluznick"" and that's exactly what it is -- a drum solo album. Unlike Pluznick's other releases this one is all drums and percussion of many sorts -- well, except for bass guitar on a couple tracks -- which means this is an album about drums, by a drummer, for other drummers.For the rest of us it is a bit, shall-we-say, dry."
4,Excellent Book For Wives!,This excellent book goes back to the basics of being a godly wife--it boils down to our relationship with God and our understanding of what he requires of us. Nancy and Connie have peppered The Politically Incorrect Wife with lively anecdotes and end each chapter with down-to-earth practical advice. The additional study guide is a practical tool for use in classroom settings.
5,I thought this was a very helpful book!,I was looking for something which would cut out some of the excess verbage on the topic of men's spirituality. This book did it. Concise and helpful.
2,"What I was looking for, but only got HALF my order!!","Ordered 10 pkgs from Amazon.com. Nice and thick page lifters, but beware, the title says ""2 Lifters per Pack"". You will only receive ONE, yes I did say ONE, lifter per pack. A total disappointment! Hope Amazon.com will follow through and send the rest!!"
3,Jury is Still Out,"Filter arrived on time in good condition.I have used this on my Apertura AD10 Dobsonian telescope. It has given me a better view of M17 (Swan nebula), and a slightly better view of the M57 (Ring nebula), but so far that's it. It makes everything look much darker and hard to find.It works well from a dark-sky site.I have seen no evidence of it filtering ""light pollution"" at all, although I'm going to go back to it from time to time to see what it can do, as I have not used it yet with winter objects (Orion nebula in particular).It is a middle-priced item, and I am not convinced it is worth the cost. It might have been better for me to use the money to purchase a Telrad, for instance, and maybe some adjusting screws for my AD10."
4,Great Product,"This box worked perfectly to connect all of the telephone lines in my house to the input line in a neat and orderly way. They builder just used a wire nut. This is so much better, and more robust."
4,Gets the job done,"I used this unit to replace the rats nest of telephone wires that were twisted together in my basement. If you're not installing this unit inside an enclosure, it is a little work to remove the plastic connectors with a pair of wire cutters. Otherwise there are zero complaints. The unit is sturdy and looks like it will last a long time. Highly recommend using a standard punch-down tool."
3,Verify your cabling before purchase,"The description for this item fails to mention that the insulation displacement connectors (IDC) only work with Cat5 (Ethernet) cable or similar. I suspect that those who left positive reviews most likely have newer homes, where Cat5 is used for telephone lines as well as data. My house was built in the 70's, so the telephone wires are thicker and will not terminate in the IDC blocks. (I do have the proper punchdown tool.) I had no choice but to return it."
2,Lots of history; little how to.,"If you think you will learn a lot you will be disappointed.Great insight into how World com and Enron frauds occurred. I got screwed to the tune of $300k by both.Very little on how to avoid.Not much substance, easy read...depends on what you are looking for.Glad I borrowed from library and did not buy."
1,Nothing New,"There isn't any new information in this book that hasn't been written about ad nauseum by the WSJ. This book offers nothing more than (hopefully for him) a way for Cramer to make some more money. Let us not forget that Cramer profited tremendously from the way the street works and now that his career and financial well being isn't dependant upon it, he is out to do this for ""the little guy."" Puh-leaze...gimme a break. As a sub to TSC, he has written about these things before and just rehashes what he has already said on that site. If it weren't for Spitzer having been an investor in his fund and being pals with him, do you think he would have went after Cramer for the things that were written about in Nicholas Meier's book? Do not waste your time with this book...much better material out there."
1,"big talker, no content",Jim went from cutting edge to selling anything. Expect Jim to start selling propecia and anything else that he can pimp on his newsletter and various other shows. Man does not get that he was part of the problem with his red hot portfolios.Please go away Jim.
2,You got screwed?,"I recieved this book for a birthday present, and I must admit, I felt a little screwed when I saw how thin this book was, 117 pages, and they are small pages too. A lot of the info in this is a rehash from his holiday radio program on Worldcom and Enron. As a loyal listener, I did not get as much from this book as I hoped I would, as I loved ""Confessions..."".There is very little new info in this book, but it does put everything together in one place."
1,Complete waste of your money and time,"I have always been intrigued by Mr.Cramer, when I found this smallish book I decided to read what he had to say about the market crash. I hoped to find some deep insights from a man who is a Wall Street insider. I am very disappointed with the book, you probably will learn more about what caused the bubble to burst by reading newspapers and magazines then you would from this book. The material in the book is very superficial and the only thing that stuck was that he was shamelessly using it as a means to advertise his web site and alert service. If you have loads of money that you want to waste, please mail it to Mr. Cramer at least then you will save a tree."
4,Brings life to the grey world of investing!,"Jim Cramer knows something about the stock market. As the manager of a hedge fund, his annual returns averaged 24% - even through several market crashes. But the best thing about this book is that he brings the information to life with his trademark personal ebullience.Mr. Cramer wrote this book to address the reasons so many people find their investment portfolios declining with the market and the fall of the tech sector shortly after the turn of the century. Dry fact presentation, such as how to read corporate financial statements, is tempered with the author's personal stories, delivered with the trademark red-faced Cramer zest that has made him so popular on radio and television.Whether you have an investment portfolio or not, you'll enjoy this view of investing from the inside."
4,Great Stuff for Anyone Willing to Think,"Excellent, concise (if somewhat oversimplified), very well written. Historical overview, from the inside, of the investing events of the past 3-5 years. Explains how everybody got sucked in. Great cautionary notes for all of us not on the inside of Wall Street. Devastating indictments of the mutual fund industry.Whatever Cramer's prior viewpoints and actions, no one can be hurt by reading and following the advice in this book, and vast numbers can be helped.Would have been that much better (5th star) had he offered specific additional sources of information beyond all his own stuff at TheStreet.com -- but then it wouldn't have been a Jim Cramer book. Buy it. Read it. Form your own conclusions."
1,You will lose your shirt following Cramer,"Jim Cramer advice and insight can literally lose you your money within a matter of months. I've never seen anyone, in the history of the stock market, and in part thanks to the internet, with the ability to lose money as quickly as Jim Cramer can. Cramer builds portfolio's then walks away from them after they lose enormous amounts of money. In 2001, Jim Cramer's Action Alert Portfolio lost over 25% within a matter of a few months. Cramer had told his followers that this was the only mid to long term investment portfolio they would EVER need to follow. He walked away from it. He is a charlatan, a snakeoil salesman, and a con artist extraordinaire."
2,You got screwed - again!,"...if you paid for this book, that is. It serves up a lot of dirt on some of the principal culprits in the debacles at Enron, Worldcom etc. and blasts the SEC for its dereliction of duty. Moderately interesting but ancient history, and not germane to the question of how you can rebuild your finances. That question isn't addressed until the last chapter of this slim volume, and then Cramer just rehashes the kind of advice you get in any decent book on investing for beginners. He does make a good point in stressing the importance of when to sell, which is often overlooked in other books. On the whole though, this is a slight and insubstantial book, quite disappointing and not worth the asking price."
1,The Master of Capital Incineration,"The author has been responsible for more capital incineration than other other journalist in the history of Wall Street. I concur that the level of hypocrisy in this book is unmatched.It is amazing at the level of intellectual dishonesty that Cramer maintains. He claims to be looking out for the little guy and rails about accountability yet he has none. His portfolios speak volumes about his expertise as they are all massively red and hidden from public view. He has started others and then abandoned them when losses were so great they represented a major embarassment to himself and his organization.The book itself is a poor attempt to generate publicity and at 110 pages lacks any kind of ""rigor"" as Cramer likes to say.Highly recommend not buying it or even bothering to check it out at the library."
1,Here We Go Again,This book is yet another example of an author cashing in on his own failures. Cramer points the finger at everyone but himself when discussing the market crash of the past few years. His own terrible record of stock picking and recommendations is well documented.Of particular amusement are the glowing 5 star book reviews he receives from employees of his own company.
1,Canon's scam,"this printer did a reasonable job for me for few months. I even printed photos with it and was satisfied with the quality. However, while it was stil under warranty, it started printing purple instead of red, and then a little later no black ink was being printed at all. Well, turns out the problem was the ""printer head"". Notice that the printer uses printer head model BC-21e and compare it's price to the printer itself. Conclusion: this printer is worth about ...(at the time of this review). Hopefully some company will read this and make a generic printer head of Canon printers..."
3,Good Value Printer,"I bought my Canon BJC-2100 about a month ago as a stop-gap. My old printer had died, and I was a little tight on money.I have been very satisfied with this printer in the time that I have had it. Canon seems to have made some improvements over the BJC-2000, most notably the separate cartridges for black&white and color. I did a little checking before I bought this, and the black&white replacement cartridges only cost about $10 (compared to over $30 for some other printers) while the color cartridge (all colors are in this one...there are no separate color wells) was about $25.This printer has given me very acceptable results. Quality has been fine, but not spectacular. Speed is OK, and I have not had to worry about any paper mis-feeds....The Canon BJC-2100 has done good work for me so far."
2,Great For Printing Text -,"Although I don't suggest it for photos, or graphics. I went from the old canon 240 to the canon 2100 when the old one gave up on me. I was told by sales that this printer would not be the best photo printer - but that they would turn out better.When I tried to print photos they came out almost as bad as the 240. Thinking I had probably messed up, I took it back and made the tech guy try it - needless to say, I left the printer at the store.-! If your trying to print nothing but text, this printer is fast, and will get the job done. I noticed it printed text fast and it looked ok. Just don't do logo's, photos, and small graphics... :)"
1,BJC-2100 dies young,"I bought a Canon BJC-2100. For a while, it worked well. On my recommendation, my sister and my next-door neighbor also bought one each.All three printers died within four months--a 100% failure rate. ..."
5,Great products come in small packages.,"I've been using my canon printer for more than 3 years and I'm very please with it. My parents wanted the same printer, so I searched the web and found one for them. The price was right and it included a ..rebate. It's a great printer and it only uses a small amount of space. The driver install process is done in a few mintues and the printer is ready to perform. This canon printer is fast and makes great color and black printed pages. This printer includes free greeting card software. My family enjoys making their own greeting cards. Replacement ink cartridges for this printer are not [that much]. The printer has 2 separate ink cartridges, one with color ink and one with black ink. If one ink cartridge runs out, the printer still prints. Great works come from this small canon printer."
1,sending printer into outspace with no return ticket.,"My Canon BJC 2010 printer came as a package deal with my Gateway computer. I have had nothing but trouble with this printer, and have owned it for approx 2 years. When I first got the printer, it was great, worked for about 3 months. Then had to replace the black ink. I have gone through 5 black ink cartridges,and one colored cartridge. and I do not do alot of printing. The jets are constantly clogged. I have replaced the entire electronic cartridge 3 times now. I now cannot get black ink to come out, and the colored, is a bit to be desired. I have contactedCanon, with absolutely no luck, their customer service is a bit to be desired. I'm sending this printer into outer space, and am now looking for a new one. I find these customer reviews very helpful in making my decisions, and have narrowed my selection down, due to these customer reviews. I recommend this printer to nobody, unless you want to use it as a plant container."
3,I never loved it before....,"but at this new price, you can hardly complain about its flimsy build, less-than-reliable paper feed, slow print speed (agonizingly s l o w for color) & very thirsty ink tanks. In point of fact, Canon might be willing to drop off a *free* 2100 to every household in North America, as the real game is in selling the ink, not the printer [think about your local cellular company: they're happy to nearly give their phones away, so long as you keep using their airtime], and this model will keep you buying ink on a regular basis."
1,Canon BJC-5100 Unreliable in the long haul,"I bought a Canon BJC-5100 about 2 years ago because is was the most economical printer that would print on 11x17 paper. I used it for occaisional light home use. It has become very unreliable with frequent problems. It will tell me there are no ink cartriges when I have just installed a new one. Some times it won't communicate with the computer. I have re-installed drivers frequently in vain attempts to get it to print. Other times it simply won't print at all. I have concluded that I need to replace it. I won't buy a Canon.Another big disappointment was that it advertised that it would print on up to 11x17 paper, but no where on the box or available literature did is specify that it had to be manually fed through the back ONE SHEET AT A TIME! Not particularly convenient."
2,Didn't last long,Unfortunately our printer only lasted 6 months. It stopped working and the diagnosis was a clogged or defective print head which would cost me more to fix than the printer originally cost in the first place. If you want a disposable printer this can be the printer for you.
4,Good product,"Seems to be comparable to the ones I've bought before. There were 3 in the pack I rec'd, and from what I read on the package of this one, it was supposed to have 4. 2 Ortho heads & 2 tips? Maybe I'm misreading something here?"
4,"Soft and comfortable, but not intelligant","I use this, since I have soft enamel. The bristles are the softest that oral-b makes, and are even a little softer than the heads that I got from with my Cybersonic toothbrush back in 2000. The color does fade to indicate when it is time to replace the head. My dentist started to notice stains on my teeth a few years after I bought Oral-B Triumph; it turn out the motor slowly dies over time. I didn't realize how weak it had been for year until it started to stall, and I had to buyt a new toothbrush. So, be mindful of your toothbrush's strength. But you might not be able to notice, so if your Dentist tells you that you have more stains than you usually have, it is probably time to replace the toothbrush and not just the head.The heads don't have a microchip to communicate their usage to the fancier Oral-b toothbrushes like some other heads."
5,The rumour is true!,"Graham Parker's backing band were a sensational bunch of musos in their own right.Call them pub rock, new wave or whatever this album stands up from its late '70s calling and is still regularly played on my cd player today.One of the greats from the era.This one even gave G.P albums a run for their money."
5,Another entertaining love story from Marilyn Clay!,"If you like a fast-paced story, laced with humor, you'll surely enjoy The Unsuitable Suitor. Lord Peterbloom is all that a hero should be, handsome, worldly, and quite content with his life, until Miss Miranda Fraser appears on the scene and indignantly reminds him of the checkered past he thought he had sucessfully lived down. Ms. Clay's detailed descriptions of life in the Regency period are exquisite; an obvious outgrowth of her involvement with the newsletter devoted to the period, The Regency Plume. She has once again written a very funny story, with not one, but two love stories that will warm your heart. Don't miss this one!"
1,absolutely horrible,"Swindoll was in love with a ""golden age"" of patriarchy that never existed. Not only does he find role models in the brutal ignorance of the Old Testament, he cites a 1947 book, Family and civilization, as an influence. Are feminist movements a cause for the ""downward spiral"" of civilization? Really? Try to imagine your life today if you had not encountered a well-educated, dedicated female teacher, physician, mentor, business partner, police officer, or political representative. This isn't a quest for character, it's advice on how to justify browbeating and manipulating your family and others. While a little lip service is given to helping others and compassion, mostly it's about being a tough guy. Needs to reread the New Testament."
3,Dubious Claims,"I've read Philip Steadman's book, and I must say I enjoyed it a great deal, but at the end of the day, the working process that he proposes for Vermeer doesn't ring true to me. Painting upside-down, in the dark, in a tiny little cubicle? I kept wondering why a painter as accomplished as Vermeer would adopt such an arduous method, when he could simply paint what was in front of him.As for the much-discussed ""camera"" look to Vermeer's paintings, his prominent highlights and detail-less shadows, Steadman hits on the simplest explanation, then passes it by, when he mentions ""the view through half-closed eyes, as it were."" Painters frequently squint their eyes to judge tones and eliminate fussy detail. In my opinion, Vermeer was one of history's great squinters.Read more at Suite101: Vermeer and His Use of the Camera Obscura: Uncovering the Truth Behind Jan Vermeer's Masterpieces [...]"
4,less is more,This video collection is nothing you haven't seen before. EXCEPT the acoustic set which makes this worth the price of admission. I challenge you to try this on a 12 string. The rest of it is just commercial video.
5,SRV rocks right from the start of his career!,"This is really a cool DVD considerably different than his pure-performance DVD's (all others except this one). If you love SRV and want everything he has done in your collection, I highly recommend this DVD!"
5,The closest I've been to SRV,"Living in New Zealand is a long way from the action in Texas, Stevie Ray's home state.Iv'e never seen him play live & have only 2 other dvds of him performing magic on his beat up old strat.This DVD has brought me the closest to Stevie Ray Vaughan that I'm ever gonna likely to get.The interview with him & his brother Jimmy are especially heart warming as it gives you a glimpse of the man behind the music.Stevie Ray Vaughan & his music are as much loved here as he is in Texas & this DVD is a must have for any of his ilk."
4,Complete Music Video Archive,This product is great for a huge SRV fan or for the SRV fan who may not have been old enough to see his music videos. It puts all of his music videos together on one disc and even has his Unplugged performances.
4,"If you like Stevie, this is a must","Love his performance on the riverboat (commit a crime), I just wished his whole performance was on this DVD. Good dvd, considering there are limited selection of SRV performances; however, I wished it had more of ""concert-feel"". It's more like a compilation of MTV music videos. The MTV unplugged section is pretty sweet, but again, I wish it was one of his full concerts."
2,A collection of music videos,This DVD is a mostly a collection of music videos that you might see on MTV.The highlight of this video however are 3 songs done live that are the exception. They feature Stevie Ray playing a 12 string guitar -Very rare!
1,Really?,I love Bob Welch's music. I for one cannot believe there can be a greatest hits CD and not include the songs She's Changing Me and Loose Your Heart. I will not buy this until Rhino can figure out someone better to make song selections.
3,Entertaining,"A very nice, typical 87th Precinct book, and it is quiteentertaining. The basic story is about a play within a play,where an actress is attacked with a knife, in both the playand the mystery story here.But it isn't that complicated, and the author does a nice jobof keeping the two mysteries straight. The characters are veryinteresting, and there is enough conflict among the variouspeople to sustain reader interest.The mystery deepens as the first obvious suspects are suddenlycrossed off the list, and the police have to begin exploringother possibilities, and the author does a very nice job ofmoving the action forward.The only hitch in the story is the author's clumsy explorationof a black-white romance, which doesn't ring true at all andseems extremely dated.But a very nice entry in this series."
3,Romance Novel is a good book!,"I like to read Romance novel, because the man who loves the woman in New York City I like it! I read about happy and sad story, I laugh and cry! I'm 21-years-old I like this adult books!"
4,Another good one,"I enjoyed this book very much. I thought I had it figured out..and then I didn't and then I did. But then that's how it's supposed to go, right? (smile)Ed McBain is my favorite mystery writer. Though Romance isn't my favorite book in the series it did rank up there. I really enjoyed getting into the personal life of Kling. It's about time he found true love."
2,Flimsy flap,"Nice color, has 20 file spaces, and the file part seems very sturdy, but the flap that closes over the top is inexplicably and ridiculously thin, about as thick as a manilla file folder. What makes this especially bad is that the velcro closure holds like iron, and you have to tug quite hard on the flimsy flap to yank it free. So, the very first time I opened it, the flap got all bent. I cannot imagine the flap will last long, so I decided to toss this in the garbage (within 5 minutes of receiving it). I got an old-fashioned brown one made by Smead (also purchased on Amazon), that has the old-fashioned elastic cord closure and a much sturdier flap."
4,Roomy!,"I love this expanding file, it is super roomy. The flap leaves a little bit to be desired, especially since the rest of the file is so sturdy. Oh well, I still love it and will keep ordering. The vendor is outstanding and fast, wow!"
2,"Good read, but lacks substance","This book is a good overview of the techniques a player could use to gain an advantage over the casino in a blackjack game, but the book lacks substance. Nowhere are there the procedures a player needs to follow to gain an advantage over the casino, and the amount of profit that can be generated is similarly lacking. I would not recommend this book for anyone who is serious about learning about advantage techniques. If you are looking for a brief, albiet well written overview however, this book is for you.."
3,"Touches on interesting topics, but errors, no depth","The author John May gives an interesting intro to advanced techniques in beating casino games. For those who think counting is the only way to go, the book will be an eyeopener. However, the book is riddled with errors in the math as as well as a shallow, unsatisfying treatment of the materials. Re-read Uston and surf the blackjack websites for more interesting tidbits."
4,Great book!,"One of the best current books on the blackjack market today! I also recommend, Gregorian Strategy for multiple deck blackjack."
1,Do yourself a favor - Do not buy this book !,"This book has some very basic discussion on card counting and hardly helpful. It discusses some ""advanced techniques"" such as ""Card Steering"", ""Shadow Play"" etc which requires a very weak dealer, a professional blackjack team, lots of bankroll and a casino without surveillance. Most of these ""advantage play methods"" are not author's own idea and these sounded more like gambling myths than facts. Do yourself a favor - Do not buy this book !"
5,Excellent book for beginning ESL students,"An excellent resource for ESL teachers who need to make vocabulary practice interesting. When I use this book, heads bend down and the students get to work. They love it!"
3,It's a pretty good CD,"I like the band a lot, they are really great guys. The CD's okay... it's not going to be the best you've ever bought, but it's worth buying (especially if it's used). They're a Christian punk-ish band (though some punk bands might laugh at that notion)."
2,Almost As Bad As Stellar Kart,"First off, how come it took this long to get a song about Myspace? The song is terrible like the site, but hey, at least they did a song about the site.Eleventyseven is another one of those bands that my younger sister would love, but not a more mature person. I mean really, if you've heard one song off this album, you've heard them all. Listen to ""More Than A Revolution"", you've heard the album. Unless I just happened to miss a song, which is possible since I fell asleep.The whole thing screams Jonas Brothers quality, from the immature voice, from the lyrics, to a sad excuse for punk music, this album is a good one to give to your little brother. Thinking of the album for yourself? Don't bother.Note: I've heard ""It's Beautiful"", and it sounds like the band will take a giant leap musically in the next album. We can only hope. The album cover looks awesome anyways."
4,"Well worth buying a used copy, and a new copy if you are new at it.","Dean and Robin show the ropes pretty well, as usual, for framing techniques. The details are good, but, as always, there is room for improvement."
3,Interesting,"This was a interesting program but a little too complicated for a lay person. I ordered this video because it wasa ""how-to"" video at a low price. Once I received it I understood why it had a low price. The video tape was tight andwhen I played it back it made a high-pitched stretching sound.None-the-less it arrived on time and could be viewed. I watched it with anticipation and discovered that there were otherskills needed in order to undertake a framing project. You must have a basic understanding of framing before you can usethis video to frame a room. Yet, it did give good, useful, basic information."
2,A disappointment,"If you like fiction that deals with unsympathetic characters and fixates on bodily excrements, this is the book for you. As for the historical aspect of this work, unless you just dropped in from Oz, you already know it."
5,FIVE STARS,"Rare is a writer such as Jonathan Wilson, whose exquisite prose maps and overlays a gripping story. Perhaps the details of place, the tensions between factions, the struggle for possession of land are not so different in 2003. At the heart of Wilson's book, however, is an unforgettable human dilemma-- people caught in time , swept through a history that threatens to obscure their very lives. This book reminded me of THE ENGLISH PATIENT, but with a greater investment in the outcome of its characters. A must read. A brilliant book."
2,Boring,Not well written; a very disjointed story. I would not recommend it to anyone. Characters are not well developed or believeable.
5,Electrifing and touching for the young at heart.,"The title alone tells a story of young and talented artists from all over the united states, that have put there love for music and respect for their families in their ability to make beautiful sounds, and with meaningful expressions touch the hearts of people, young and old. What was really impressive was the selection of music that can honestly bring different cultures together and celebrate in dance and song. Also one the percussionist is a close friend, Jorge""Bro""...We in R.G.C. are very proud of you. I knew that all those hours of practice and overwhelming me with your talent would eventually take you places. Congratulations A.B. and the Kumbia Kings... ART & MARK"
5,GOTTA HAVE IT,ONE WORD OF ADVICE - GET THIS CD NOW BEFORE IT SELLS COMPLETELY OUT. THIS IS THE BEST CD OF THE YEAR. IF U HAVENT HEARD IT YET JUST LISTEN TO THE SAMPLES AND YOU'LL FALL IN LOVE WITH IT. GREAT WORK FELLAS. HOPE TO HEAR ALOT MORE FROM U IN THE FUTURE.
1,"Smells horrible, dried out my brushes.",I would not buy this product again. It smells really horrible and seems to have dried out my expensive cosmetic brushes.
1,The smell..,"Received the item fast, makes my brushes fluffy, but the smell is horrible. It smells like orange citrus but it's too strong. I thought it would go away but I washed it with another cleaner and the smell is still there, wish I had tried it before. Not sure if I'll be using this often but I won't repurchase."
3,Good cleaner but overwhelming smell,"I've been searching for a more affordable brush spot cleaner to break away from using my normal MAC one. As far as cleaning goes, this one works very well. However, the smell is a fairly overwhelming fruity/floral that makes me a bit nauseated after a few minutes of use. It's also on the oily side, which I'm not crazy about. I will definitely finish this bottle up (with windows open) as it does work well for its intended purpose, but most likely I will not be re-purchasing."
5,The best fake eye lash cleaner EVER!!,"I'm starting to wear fake eye lashes to give my real lashes a break from mascara, so I decided to search into youtube a video on how to clean or how long will my fake lashes would be wearable.Anyway, I found a lady showing how this product help her fake lashes to get rid off mascara and glue with in 10 minutes.I decided to purchase this in the big bottle for a better and lasting use, I left my lashes soak for 15 minutes..and Whala!!My fake eye lashes are clean, disinfected and ready for a use and the best thing is that this liquid has a lime and orange fresh smell so it does not let my lashes smell awful at all.I will be ordering more of this I am sure.Thank you :-)"
1,There's no backet.,There's no backet. It's designed to nail on a wall. Had to red neck rig a bracket for in home window viewing. Not what I was expecting.
2,Too difficult to read,"I bought this as an outdoor thermometer which I placed on a post a few yards from my kitchen window. Unfortunately, the red line is so thin and the numbers so small that it is only useful when viewed quite close up. On the plus side, it was very inexpensive and I will find another use for it."
1,Timex TX1003 10.62-Inch Tube Thermometer,THIS THERMOMETER DOES NOT OFFER AN ACCURATE READING OF THE ACTUAL AMBIENT TEMPERATURE. AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF GETTING WHAT YOU PAID FOR. I SHOULD OF TAKEN MY OWN ADVISE AND BY PAYING THE PRICE FOR BETTER QUALITY.
2,not great,"I bought this for a 1st gr. classroom. It is kept outside all the time except for weather time. we bring it in, read the weather, record it in our weather journals and put it back outside the window. Well, after only 3 short months, the red started to seperate. I brought it inside over a weekend thinking it need to warm up (this was in 30 degree weather). But no luck. There it stays with some red at 50 degrees and the rest at whatever temp it is outside. irritating. I ordered another hoping this one was defective. Nope. Same thing. This obviously isn't meant for cold weather although the description says no such thing. the plastic is kind of flimsy and the tube that holds the red liquid is only hot glued on the back so it comes off easy. i would not reccomend for outside use but the size is nice."
4,TheMellowSoundsOfBradleyPowell,"I received 2 CD's from Brad last week,the first record I played was his newest one,""Soul Mates and Kindred Spirits.""I fell in love with the Mellow,Peacefull sounds,and gave the tape a 5 star review.""Music for the Rest and Renewal""was just as enjoyable,but Brad has grown so much from this 2001 collection,I had to rate it lower.I suggest buying both CD's,but play this one first and you will be amazed of the growth of this artist."
4,Love it,I am an Esthetician and use this CD while giving facial treatments in my spa room. It's perfect and so relaxing. My customers love it.
2,Not up to par with the other two cds by this artist,"I rate the other two cds by this artist as fives, but was disappointed in this one. There is too much time between the tracks and the nature sounds often sound like they are just placed before the songs rather than incorporated into the music as well as the other two cds. With a ""moods"" cd - you want the experience to flowwwww together - this one falls short in that department. Get the cds called ""Soul Mates & Kindred Spirits"" and ""Sunflower Serenity"" instead and I don't think you will be disappointed. I would skip this one however."
2,Not as Good as the Reviews Indicate,"Technically the guitar is well done, however, this CD totally lacks any emotional intensity in any one of the tracks. I was very disappointed especially given all the great reviews indicated on the Amazon sales page. This may be a fine CD for background music while working or playing, however, if you are purchasing this CD to attentively listen to the music you may be disappointed. I did not find the nature sounds to be very well done either."
5,Love this plant,"I've looked for a burrow's tail for quite a long time now, with no luck - until now. Actually, I bought one for myself a month ago, and just ordered another one for a friend.The shipping was fast, the plant arrived in perfect condition, and I am very happy with the whole experience."
3,"Good, but typical","While a good read, Modesitt sticks to the same formula -- and as successful as it is, the books are coming more and more predictable. I enjoyed it -- mostly -- but felt a little let down."
1,The last one? Promise?,"I thought the third volume of this series was the last. I had actually hoped that the first would be the last. While I admit that Secca and Alcaren are nowhere near as annoying as Anna was, and the musical reference are not as stupid as they were in the first three volumes, I pray that the promises are true, that Modesitt, whose science fiction stuff is fun and mostly worth reading, will abandon this awful area and go back to what he knows how to write.There are other fantasy series that understand music much better, The Dragonriders of Pern being the first, the Haydon RHAPSODY cycle being the best. As a music teacher, I have felt a trainwreck-like compunction to read these so called music fantasies, but I can't express in words or song how happy I am that they may finally be over."
3,Very Long War History,"This reads like a dry crimean war history in a school history class. From battle to battle to battle the book crawls along from horses to ships to slaughter after slaughter. Modesitt must really be hung up on a woman's right to govern, and strangely this is Arms Commander with some different clothing. This book was filled with characters I really didn't care about, and like watching a movie with too many gun fights, a little slaughter goes a long way. The dragging of people from place-to-place with little discovery along the way. I liked the main character and her situation of ever-escalating violence--that was quite relevant to this world, and how far do you go. There are some contests which can only end in death. A war novel really should have some type of pay-off after slogging through all the mudy forests and the burned out cities and dead rotting corpses. For the length of the book and taken as a whole, not much payoff. It was ""ok."""
5,Easy to use...full of good tools,I am just learning about Continuous Improvement and the tools that are available to make that happen in the workplace. Our company is considering implementing a Six Sigma program and this book provides me with a related and large tool set to add to my tool belt.
5,Such a tremendous piece of work!,I believe this book to be a fair and just look at the differences between Mormonism and mainstream Christianity. Within this book one will find information in arguement and defense of both sides. This book is very well written and quite an easy read. I very much enjoyed this book. Donna Morley stays on track and does not stray from the point of the book. The purpose of this book is to allow the reader to view information that they may then go and look up in its entirety with the provided verses in both the mormon books and The Bible and then be able to fairly form an opinion.
3,"Syncs, but doesn't charge","I just moved from the Palm world to the Pocket PC world, and bought this cable without reading the fine print. A similar cable for my Palm also charged the unit through the USB port, but this cable doesn't, so it's not helpful for all but the shortest trips."
5,When Spirits Touch,"If you are an advanced spirit, you will enjoy this book. This book helped me reflect on the significant person who has come into my life and why we have come together. We feel the same way about Mother Earth and have had similar encounters with the spirits in Nature and Mother Earth herself. This book expresses it succinctly in the phrase...""When Spirits Touch"". This book made me aware of the individual changes going on everywhere and that when two individuals who are at the same spiritual level, become one, they can the change the world."
4,"Reminds me of a certain DEEE-LITE'er, and just as good!","This is the perfect disk to by if you are looking for a good mood. Say you are throwing a little wine shindig, the port will flow to the beats! Overall a suprisingly delectable flow."
5,After repeated listenings hear amazing depth and virtousity,"I wrote a lukewarm review below. With repeated listenings I discovered an album of remarkable depth and real accomplishment. These guys are really tight and well-produced. It is not a dance-dance album, but rather a party album for people to dance to or not. But I'd recommend it over practically any other recent ""techno"" release. Its deep, rich and rewards repeated listenings."
3,"Not like Cassius: ""Feeling for you"" on Astralwerks sampler","I bought this based on the song Feeling for you on the Astralwerks sampler included with the Chemical Brothers CD Surrender (which blows, btw). I don't know whether I like the Cassius cd, but it is nothing like that song--which is actually a remix by LES RYTHMES DiGiTALES. If you want something that sounds like that song, buy LES RYTHMES DiGiTALES' CD Darkdancer. It moves! I will say this about Cassius, there is a lot of depth there and I need to listen to it more before I make up mind. As one other person said, I was resolutely unimpressed at first listen."
2,"Cassius album disappointing, same-sounding","Cassius' ""1999"" is an upbeat, but disappointing and somewhat dull album. While ""1999"" does show signs of promise, this French group fails to live up to the hype. The album is essentially house music, with elements of funk and R&B -- very groove-oriented. But the songs often go nowhere and there's no defined form or structure to many of the tracks. If you're looking for a no-brainer, forgettable album, then ""1999"" is for you. It's obvious Cassius was ""dreaming when they wrote this,"" but I can't forgive them for ""going astray."""
1,"All Hype, No Substance","Since some french dance acts started appearing in the late nineties, a new dance scene began to emmerge as well, mixing disco beats with electronica and generating a retro-futuristic sound. Daft Punk were one of the more challenging and inventive bands, even if their albums are flawed and uneven. Air offered laid-back, dreamy and smooth atmospheres. Cassius, however, failed to engage, as one can prove with ""1999"".Yes, this record has a couple of interesting dance songs like ""Crazy Legs"" or ""Interlude"", still as a whole it`s a repetitive, uninspired, endless and at parts irritating album. Some of this material is ok for a nightclub, but as a record it doesn't really get off the ground. It brings nothing new, it`s basically a waste of time, and ends up being another flat, monotonous and overrated record.A collection of fillers."
3,Pretty good but not perfect,"When it comes to electronica music, France really has breathed new air into one of my favorite genres of music. I love Air, Dimitri From Paris, Rinocerose (well their first album anyways), and Daft Punk (of course). Unfortunately I could not get into Cassius. No matter how hard I tried, I could not get into Cassius's ""1999"". The songs lacked the funkiness of Daft Punk or the intricate melodies of Air. The group's choice of samples were interesting to say the very least. I don't see very often an artist who would sample from '70s blaxploitation flick ""Foxy Brown"" like Cassius did on ""Foxxy"". Unfortunately what didn't really groove with me was the fact that the beats in most of the songs sounded too repetitive. I liked ""Feeling For You"", ""La Mouche"", ""Foxxy"" and ""Cassius Remix '99"" but otherwise this album didn't leave much of an impression on me, neither bad nor good. And when an album doesn't leave much an impression on me you know that isn't a good sign."
3,"Allright, but not exellent","Cassius is another french dance group, they surely make some nice dance music. Feeling For You, Crazy Legs andLaMouche are all suberb dance tunes, the best song of the Cd is defenitely ""Cassius 99"" but actually it was the remix that was the one released on single. Cassius produces Funky-dance music at it's best, unfortunately many songs are fillers and almost sound the same. I think 16 songs are way too much, ok Cd anyway. For the good tunes i mentioned it's defenitely worth buying the Cd."
5,PHAT BREAK BEAT DISCO FOR ALL,"Cassius '99 having torn like armaggedon through the E-dropping community in Europe makes its mark on US club goers. This is the stuff dreams are made of folks. I personally have danced to this album till Nine o'clock in the morning, ad that was by myself. Is this album really that great or am I just a loser either way I think that you will enjoy the fluidity and hipnotic overtones that this album induces. If your into creamed corn and sit-coms on a friday night DO NOT,I REPEAT, DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM. But if your into dancing from the pit of your soul until your body cant keep up with your mind's addiction to the throbbing pulses of really, really phat beats, hitchike to the record store if you have to."
4,Bert and......Missing Mop,"So glad I got this book. I already had the tape, and my grandson, Kieran LOVES to listen to books on tapes. Thank you amazon for filling most of my Christmas needs!"
1,Disappointed,"My excitement quickly went south. Shipping was prompt. Packaging was great. I had a good feeling that I would be impressed. But...I was surprised at the low quality of the product.The wood is barely above plywood grade. It has the consistency of the cheap wood frequently from Asia and has the softness of pine. The wood grain is not attractive -unlike the picture. The stain and finish are rough -- there are scratches from low grade sandpaper and flecks of dust in the finish.Assembly is poor. Some screw heads were stripped and not tightened. The screw holes look like they were made with a chisel rather than a drill - uneven, differing depths, ragged edges, non-round holes.If I return the product, I'm out about $32. Thus, I'm stuck. You'd be better off putting a board on a pillow. Expensive lesson!"
3,Careful with this one,"Let me just say, if your a Billie Holiday ""enthusiast"" and would love to hear a different perception of the 1935-1942 output, this is the box set for you. Whoever did the re-production was a bit over the top in my humble opinion. As you may have read: ""These recordings are a bit blurred with heavy bass and have an added touch of stereo reverb."" I like that touch of reverb personally. One other nice thing, that surface noise is really quiet and on some songs completely gone. Very nice!The overall sound quality and re-production really works nicely on most songs, it's like seeing them in a whole new light. But, some songs don't quite work as well. So, I've found that the best way to listen to this set, is either at a low level, or if you must play it louder, turn the bass (or low end) down a few notches, at least."
2,Not happy with the sound.,"As mentioned in a couple of other reviews I just read, there is too much bass. Apparently reverb has also been added. After I put this set on my ITunes, I went through to delete duplicate cuts. In almost every case the songs from this 10 CD ""Portrait"" set were the ones that got deleted. Meaning, every other Billie CD I own has better fidelity.Still, if you just want a bunch of Billie Holiday music, and you should, this is only $30.00!"
1,Very disappointed,"I give it one star for the engergy boost. That was the only benefit for me. I went to the gym, and yet my weight stayed the same. I was very excited when I ordered it, but after a few weeks I gave up. I was extrememly disappointed. I am convinced that diet pills are a joke. Please, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!The only way I lost weight was by eating small portions, every few hours, and walking at lunch. I lost 12 lbs in two months, and I continue to lose weight by watching my portions and working out, my total weight loss is 18 lbs."
4,so so results but a good mood enhancer,"i really waited a while to review this item. Honestly it kind of works if u dont have an eating disorder. I think it really pays off when ur int eh GYM. I realized that right away. My performance in teh GYM was amazing. Plus it does keep u in a happier and more positive mental state. The weight was sheding off. I think this is one of those suppliments where if the person goes to the gym, it will be extremely benefical. it does supress food for a while :(Dont expect this to work on its own like some other drugs out there such as Xinical."
1,It Didn't Do Anything!,"I ordered Lipovarin with hopes of jump-starting my weight loss plan. After taking the pills for over a week, NOTHING! I didn't even lose one pound, and I was exercising! Would not buy it again."
1,I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED !!!,"I will start by saying, USE YOUR MONEY TO BUY NEW RUNNING SHOES AND GO FOR A WALK!!!!!I wanted results from this product so badly, but again I was diaappointed. It did nothing!I think it was a placebo because I wasn't nauseaus, jiitery, more energetic, less hungry, or anything. It did absolutely nothing!After wasting my money I realized that this last ten pound struggle is going to require getting my (...) out of the chair and working out, so I through out my empty bottle of lipovarin and through on some sweats and sneakers and I'm out the door, see you later!P.S. If there was a Zero star option I would have given it to Lipovarin."
1,How disapointing,"I went through every review Amazon had and quite a few of the 5 star reviewers actually gave 5 stars to many other diet pills by the same company who made lipovarin. Needless to say, I won't be wasting my money - but I am disapointed over the faux publicity this pill is getting."
1,Don't waste your $$$,"Both my husband and I bought and used this product. No weight loss for me and weight gain for my husband. This product may seem appealing cuz it costs so much so you think it works better when in fact it does not. What they don't flat out tell you is that when you buy this expensive product, you do have to use it with a combination of other pills they offer to get it's full effect, thus costing even more than what you think. The pills do not work alone. I would consider saving your money and investing it into cheaper weight loss pills with the same effect."
1,WASTE of $$!!,"I'm so annoyed. This product sucked. I would give it 0 stars, but there is no zero! I believed the damn reviewers on here. After I tried the product for a few days, I went back online to see if I was taking it properly and to read the advice others would suggest. I finally noticed that the people that gave the best reviews were pushers of the product when I clicked on their other reviews. What the heck?? The product did nothing for me. In fact, I felt bloated and hungrier for more crap---like chips and chocolate. I usually don't have cravings that strong. I exercised for an hour 5 times a week doing elliptical, just like before I took the pills. This pill did nothing. In fact, after a week of taking these things I gained weight!! Now I'm all bloated and have to wear my fat pants thanks to this product. LIES ALL LIES!!!"
3,This works great,I am very happy with this product. It has helped me lose alot of weight I gained due to depression. I am earning back my self esteem by looking and feeling great. I take the recommended dosage religiously and it isn't making me jittery or wired which I highly appreciate.
1,I didn't loose any weight....,"I'm 5'11 175 lbs. I did some research before buying this product looking for an effective fat burner with energy increase. I went through 2 complete bottles of 90 caplet Lipovarin but had no results. I am already a physically active person, and even changed my eating habits to low-fat. I still didn't get any results after the 1st bottle, I tried a second because I thought I would need to take it for a longer period of time to become more effective, still nothing. I felt a small burst of engery during my daily workout, that's it. Based on researched reviews it seems to work well for everyone else. ???"
2,Made me feel sick,"I took this a couple of years ago and it made me feel nauseated. I read that those were some side effects, especially if you're just beginning to take them, so I just took it continually for a few weeks. The results were the same. I had some classes at the time and the nausea/slightly dizzy feeling made it a little more difficult to focus. I reduced the amount I took (less than the recommended dosage) and I felt less dizzy/nauseated. I still stopped taking it after a while and got rid of the rest of the pills. I guess it did help with decreasing my appetite though, but the feelings I experienced were not worth it."
5,LIPOVARIN REALLY WORKS!!,AMAZING PRODUCT!! I LOST 20LBS IN THE FIRST MONTH!! READ MY TESTIMONIAL I LEFT FOR THE LIPOVARIN 150 REVIEW. LIPOVARIN IS A MUST-HAVE FOR ANYONE LOOKING TO LOSE WEIGHT!!!!
2,Dont buy it,"I bought this stuff from walmart on sale for like 29.98$, and ive been on it a week with nothing but heartburn and nausea. I think the gimmick is that youll feel so sick from taking them youll end up tossin cookies. and drop weight.the shakes are also pretty bad. i read reviews that these go away after a few days. but theyre not going away. I started out at 190 and im 188.Another setback is that it suppresses your appetite. TOO WELL. i didnt feel the urge to eat for like 3 days. and if i DID eat id get sick as a dog. ive stopped taking the pill and decided to be a NON lazy person and just EXERCISE. some people should try that instead of wasting money on this pill. A jumprope, a ablounger, something... JOG! but these pills will make you feel like complete and utter trash. I dont care what anyone says. They are not very good to take."
2,hmmm....weight loss,"What a difficult subject for a woman, and still so much to say.About the pills, they don't appear to harm you, but not a grate result eather.....toward the end,the last few days( more like three days) I lost 2-3 pounds. I ate sensible (as they call it), but still, not a grate help."
1,Product does NOT work!,"These 5 star reviews are too funny! If you do a little research on these ""reviewers"" you'll see what's really going on!I wonder how much $ these people are getting paid. Another observation, if 1 negative review is written another 3 positive reviews go up immediately. By the way guys, it's a little obvious when these positive reviews are all written within a day of each other!"
2,Not as Great as I thought it would be :(,"I've heard so many great reviews on lipovarin that I thought that I'd give this pill a shot. Well the only thing that this pill did for me in the month that I took it was give me the shakes. I was very jittery and irratable the entire time and I do not feel like this pill did anything significant for me. The first week it did curb my appetite, but after that it didnt do anything as far as giving me more energy or suppressing my appetite. I work out 2 hours a day 6 days a week and watch what I eat. In my opinion hydroxycut is way better than this overpriced pill!"
1,THIS SELLER IS A THIEF!!! THEY DO NOT REFUND MONEY!!,I ORDERED MY PRODUCT AND SENT IT BACK BECAUSE IT DID NOT AGREE WITH MY STOMACH BUT THE SELLER SAID THEY DO NOT ACCEPT RETURNS! THEY ARE LIERS AND CHEATS! BEWARE OF THIS SELLER ANDI WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN
2,Not worth the money...,"I bought Lipovarin because it was listed as the Consumer Health Digest's top weight loss supplement (out of 30 reviewed). I just finished the bottle this weekend after taking it religiously and I have not lost a single pound. It did seem to give me energy especially in the late afternoon/evening but as far as supressing my appetite, it did nothing. I could expect this out of a $10 diet pill but not from one I shelled out $60 for. I would not recommend this product."
2,Didn't do anything,"I decided to purchase Lipovarin based on the reviews. However, other than making me irratable, they did not do anything. I will add that there were times when I did not take the full dosage recommended, but I did try them for a full month. I am now back to Trimspa and have lost 6 pounds."
2,not great,"I lost 3 pounds in 3 days, and then all loss stopped. I ate right, worked out, and saw no help from the pills. Not worth the money."
4,I have my energy back for the gym,"I have been motivated since I started taking these because I saw a difference in my weight the first week and I wasn't even really exercising, just the 4 block walk to the bus stop and back every morning and afternoon 5 days a week. This really does suppress your appetite. The thought of food disgusts me, making it easy to think of food as fuel when it comes to breakfast, lunch and dinner I refuse to skip a meal. It's easier now to eat small portions of healthier food. I will keep taking lipovarin to help me lose weight."
3,It does do what it says it will...,"Lipovarin did indeed supress my appetite and give me more energy--it's good to take it before working out. BUT whatever you do, do NOT take 6 pills a day! I did that the first day and forgot to eat and ended up eating like a whole pizza that night just so that I wouldn't die of starvation (I felt light headed and the other effects of hunger expect actual hunger if that makes sense). The second day I took 4 and threw up. After that, I didn't take more than 2 a day, and that was enough. I stopped after a while though because I felt like I was losing weight in my thighs and butt faster than my stomach and I thought that was weird, but it might have been in my head, I don't know. Anyway, if you want to control your eating and get some energy before working out--buy this. But it is definitely a SUPPLEMENT...don't expect any magic."
2,Tried and Failed,"Well I read all the reviews and thought I could lose weight to, it did not work for me."
1,caffeine was good,Yeah this doesn't work. Don't act like it does. It might as well just be a caffeine pill
4,Lipovarin Review,I am thrilled with the results I achieved with Lipovarin. I lost 5 solid pounds in the first week alone...talk about modivation!It is the most amazing weightloss product on the market. I am on week 6 and I have lost a total of 26 pounds. It has increased my energy and I don't mean by making me jittery or jumpy- I mean REAL natural energy.This really works!
4,Very Good Product,I am quite happy with the Lipovarin product. I have lost the weight that I set as a goal but I was a bit jittery for the first couple of days taking the product.
1,Ineffective,"I work at a major pharma company, and in assessing the safety and tolerability of this product, I can report that I did not have any adverse experiences such as dizziness or headache. However, even though I followed the dosing instructions on the drug label, after several weeks I noticed no change in my weight and so threw the remaining product in the trash. I would, therefore, rate this drug as clinically ineffective in my case and a waste of money. More effective would have been a low-fat, low-sugar daily diet combined with a regular regimen of cardiovascular exercise. Save your money, cut down on the fats and sugars, and get outside and exercise as much as your schedule allows!"
5,LOST OVER 45LBS IN 3 MONTHS!!!!!,LIPOVARIN IS THE #1 WEIGHT LOSS PRODUCT PERIOD!!!! I have tried others before with no results but this stuff works wonders! I am never hungry anymore than i should be and i get nice energy all day!! I love the way is makes me perky in the morning as well! I will recommned this to EVERYONE! I have tried some scam product before called Thermadrol which made me sick to my stomach. DO NOT TRY THERMADROL. What a waste of money that crap is.
4,Amazing product,A very effective product. It helped me lose the weight I needed for my wedding within a record time. Me and two of my bridesmaids started taking the product at the same time and we all achieved our desired weight loss goals.
5,Lipovarin is the best for weight loss!,"I can't begin to tell you how well Lipovarin works. A woman at work recommended this to all of us at the office and can I tell you we formed a very strong weight loss support group. (There's 7 of us) We are all taking Lipovarin...some bandwagon we started! The common denominator of our group is our New Years's Resolution: to lose weight and feel fabulous. Lipovarin curbs your appetite without making you jittery. You absolutely need to do some form of exercise for atleast 20 minutes a day....and most importantly, be selective on what you feed your body. No weight loss pill alone will be effective. What I love about Lipovarin the most is that it really works without altering your mood.Best of Luck!Eva Cecilio"
1,would not hold tilt,this had problems holding tilt on 19lb lcd tv. I went with omnimount which had better reviews and omnimount works perfectlyfor one year now with an even heavier monitor.
5,fits my purpose,we already had this mount and needed another one so we could interchange the tv from the outdoor kitchen to the master bath. This type of mount allows for easy interchange saving client from having to but another tv.
5,Great Product,Specifically made for the small television. Easy to mount. Comes with everything you need.
1,"Out of Stock, not listed that way",I purchased this Item at the beginning of the week and it took them 5 days to tell me it is out of stock. Why the item wasn't originally listed out of stock is a wonder to me. I would skip this company.
4,Challenging and rewarding puzzle,"My husband and I labored over this 1000 piece mystery puzzle for hours and hours. If, like us, you have a masochistic streak, you'll get a buzz from assembling its oddly shaped pieces with seemingly disparate colors and patterns. We thought the resulting picture was worth the effort. Tonight, we'll try to tackle the puzzle's mystery. Wish us luck! Why didn't I give this puzzle a 5? I guess I'm being a bit picky, but I would have loved if some of the pieces had been shaped in figures like horses or swords..."
2,Wasted Potential,"The Mailman had a perfect story but couldn't deliver, no pun intended. The acting was weak and the fight and kill scenes were some of the worst ive seen in cinema history. I wanted to shut it off half way thru but I stuck thru to the end. Its ok to watch one as one viewer pointed out but nothing worth owning. This would be a perfect movie to remake."
3,Don't mess with the Postal Service,The actor who portrayed The Mailman did a fine job . I did not care for the other actors and wished that that The Mailman had gone Postal on all of them by the end of the film .
1,"Cheesy, Horrible, Etc... What else can I say.","The Mailman is actually an under ""B"" rating movie, if there is such a thing. It is really bad. The movie is like one of those that appear to be home made. There is really no plot to the movie. The acting is so bad. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. If you are thinking of purchasing this please think again. You would be very disappointed in it. I did not even watch the whole thing because it was that cheesy. Ok the mailman is going around killing people but there is no storyline to it. I will put it this way, if there was such a thing as not giving a movie any stars at all I would rate this one with none."
5,"Oh, I love him!","Where do I even start? He is one of my favorite horses I have. I would prefer that his mane and tail were lighter. It's just a tad unrealistic. There is one bad and good thing about his white. The good thing is that rubs are not visible unless on the grey hooves or the cream main and tail. The bad thing is that his white coat shows every single dark mark you get on him! But otherwise, he is a beautiful, wonderful horse! I gave him a 3 in educational because of his main and tail color.I would totally recommend him! He's a great gift."
2,"Different, becoming too contemporary","Here's the bottom line, if you're a new fan of Pat Green's or if you're a diehard who loves Pat to death, you'll probably like (not love) this CD. It has a handful of songs that are very good. On the other hand, if you're more a fan of Pat's earlier stuff, you will be disappointed. The band has evolved and the song-writing has changed, fairly drastically compared to his old stuff. The new sound is very produced sounding and does not sound ""Texas"" at all. It sounds polished and produced and basically like everyone else (pop country). To me, his band has too many people in it. Why do you need 3 guitar players in a band? Why go to California to cut a record when you did your best stuff right there in Texas? The music would sound so much better if it was stripped down."
3,Getting Better,"I've been listening to Pat since ""Dancehall Dreamer"" and as anyone else who has been listening to him that long you sure can see a change. Pat use to have this original, raw, outlaw sound to his music and then somewhere around ""3 Days"" that all changes. While ""Lucky Ones"" is better then the disaster that ""wave on wave"" was, it is still not back to that Classic Pat Green; but this album gives you hope of that return."
2,TX via MA,"I became acquainted with Pat Green while living in Texas for 15 years. His raw energy and non-conforming style were instantly likeable and more important, respected. I have several of his CD's and listen to them often. Disregarding the reviews on Amazon, I ordered Lucky Ones, thinking people possibly too tough. Realizing that artists grow and change, maybe writing/performing songs about Texas and drinking beer was a thing of the past at least on this CD. But what is missing here is his rawness, creativity and sheer Pat Green style. I will concede that Don't Break My Heart Again is good and I do hear him in that song. Depressingly, whenever I long for Texas and pull out a Pat CD to make living up here easier, this will not be one of them. What I especially miss are the references to his (what appers to be) fundamental religious beliefs and love of family that you just knew came from his heart. PAT, PLEASE COME BACK."
2,"Not horrible, but not really very good either","Just bought this CD and at first listen there are really no great songs that I'll want to listen to more than a couple of times. There is not really a ""Threadbare Gypsy Soul"" or ""Eden's Gate"" on this album. There is definately no ""George's Bar"" or ""Southbound 35"" on here. I appreciate that artists change over time, but all of these songs are really just average. Very little emotion at all."
2,Another poor effort.,"I gave this two stars because it was better than ""Wave on Wave"" (which I thought was awful), but it still ain't very good. It seems that the glory days of Pat are gone and this is what we're left with. There isn't one song on this album I'd want to hear more than once (at least ""Run"" on WoW was good). I was one of the biggest Pat fans in the world, and unfortunately, I can't blame this album on selling out. He hasn't sold out, he's just not good anymore. Oh, Pat, where have you gone?"
2,Another One Gone,I started out and continue to be a fan of mainstream country. But when I first heard Pat Green and Cory Morrow I fell in love with Texas Country. This album is very disappointing. Its just like all the other Nashville Country out there. Pat lost his luster with this release. Now I only have Cory left. I hope he doesn't sell out too.
3,"Good, but he has progressed into...","3.5 STARS: Good CD, but Pat Green has grown into a different songwriter. This is a much more produced and polished ""mature"" record (huhummm, not as many songs bout Texas and drinkin'). Die hard fans of Pats earlier work, prior to Wave on Wave/Three Days are probably gonna dislike this album. I really think it is much more radio ready. All the songs are ""good"", not as many stand out as ""great"". The duet ""college"" with Brad Paisley actually works for me and seems more like an older Pat song, probably due to the subject matter. The Jack Ingram cover of One Thing is pretty darn good too. All in all, some good music, but not the same PG, and ya know what I guess that ain't all that bad."
2,Judy Garland: The Life on an American Legend - Yeah Right!!!,"This book is utter CRAP to be frank. The writing is fine,and easy to follow, but there are MAJOUR problems with this book. The facts are wrong - at the end he states ""At 46...Judy Garland was dead"" Correct me if Im wrong, butJudy Garland was 47 when she died. He also seems ro have a dislike of Judy, by calling her ""Garland"" when refering to her.Take my advice go with World's Greatest Entertainer of Judy, to get a good bio of Miss Show Biz: Judy Garland"
4,"A second reading required, be prepared.","This is an odd, yet interesting book on the life of Ms. Garland. Considering Mr. Shipman's credentials, it cannot be just dismissed. A large book (515 pages of actual reading is substantial!), I was unable to put it down when I first read it and yet, it speculates so much on an aspect of her personal life, that it really does require a second reading in order to digest all that he claims to be fact. Not that it's a ""trash"" novel, but it does make a fan of Ms. Garland's stand back and take a look at what it claims to be fact. Still, worth buying and reading, possibly reading more than once."
1,Another piece of trash about Judy? Oh gee what a shock,David Shipman has been described by some who knew him as a man who would always embellish a quote to make it sound worse. With this book he comes off as a man with a chip on his shoulder and preoccupied with what went on in the bedroom. He presents his own opinions and speculation as if it were fact.
1,tabloid trash,"This is a fat, nasty book. It's thinly-sourced, but chock full of factual errors that are easily recognizable to any real fan (one small e.g., he claims she got distracted by a heckler and flubbed the introduction to ""If Love Were All"" in the Carnegie Hall concert....but millions of people know that recording by heart and know she didn't flub it). The worst parts are when the author tries to get into Judy's head and comes up with psychotic and nonsensical speculations about her sex life and motivations -- i.e. declaring that she married Minnelli, a ""known"" homosexual, only so that she could continue to have affairs with other men ""guilt-free."" It's crazy and disgusting."
4,Editorial reviewer needs to take a soothing drink & relax,"Even though this isn't the place to say it, I loved the movie ""Reds"", though it's not without flaws, and the soundtrack is just as admirable. However, it's probably most enjoyable to those who admire the movie; I mean, it's not by any mean ""easy listening"", except for certain tracks. Guess these are the tracks the editorial reviewer meant by calling the soundtrack (& the film) ""sentimental"", which is probably not unjustified, but that's life. Sometimes life is sentimental; the early 20th century was, in many ways, a more innocent time. I think the soundtrack, with its mix of sentiment and sturm-und-drang, reflects this time accurately.I'm a little fondly biased for the song, ""You can't come & play in my yard"" because my grandmother (born 1906) used to sing it, as her mother sung it to her!"
3,Not worth the money,i love mossy oak products but I have to say that I was disappointed when I received the switchpale cover and realized that the print is made out of contact paper that I could have made myself for cheaper. When I placed on my light switch the decal immediately started to peel off. What a great big disappoinment.
3,Not worth the money,This took forever to get and it wasn't as good as we thought it was going to be. It looked like a piece of wallpaper or contact paper glued on a light switch cover.
1,Too damn hard to use.,"This is set for PAL, not NTSC. It also does NOT do what is inferred, i.e. make a DVD for TV use. Would not recommend this for ANYONE. I am an electrical engineer who makes DVDs from photos all the time. Tried this and will not ever use it again."
1,Simply awful!!!!,"Save your money, this is probably the worst software I have bought in years. Very slow and all the programs that come with it want you to upgrade for more money. I gave it chance for the price and reading a review in PCPhoto magazine, not worth it."
2,"Beautiful, With Horrific Customer Service","The see-through mechanics of this watch are hypnotizing and got me through many long meetings. Lots of compliments too. However, it never kept very good time, gaining or losing several minutes each day. After just 14 months, the winding wheel fell off. The internal stem had cracked and that's when the true Invicta nightmare begins.Their customer service is maddening; they don't want your money so they don't want your service. Invicta refuses to reply to even the most basic of email requests. I don't know why the even publish an email address. So you must call them and fight through their ""customer avoidance shield""; i.e. hold times of 30 minutes each time. Finally after almost three months (they lost my order after the first 5 weeks), the part arrived and didn't fit.Invicta; beautiful, interesting, but oh so disappointing."
4,"Very, very nice watch","The looks are very impressive, a lot nicer than in the picture, and the price is unbelievable. I have two complaints though.The first on is about the accuracy, specially if it takes you more than 24 hours to wind it, it runs about 3 or 4 minutes quicker, since I wind it once a day, I hace to adjust one or two minutes every time I wind it.The other thing is that the wrist band is a little short, so if you have thick wrists, you should go to a store and try it on first."
1,Review: The Sellout Diaries,"To sum up: this film is horrible. The filming is sloppy, the research is sloppy, and the only point made is that black people (sellouts) who find happiness for themselves in ways that the filmmaker does not agree with are harming other blacks who could not do the same for themselves."
5,A Spirituality for Athletes,"Susan Saint Sing's new book, ""Spirituality of Sport: Balancing Soul and Body,"" is an extraordinary weaving of personal experience and philosophical meditation. Using her own experience as athlete and coach and that of other athletes, Dr. Saint Sing both informs and inspires the reader to excel, to strive toward excellence as a way not only of balancing body and soul, but also as a way of breaking through to an experience of the Divine. This book would be an excellent adjunct text for college students and for high school students, as well. An extraordinary job of taking the reader on a journey through the inner world of the athlete whose determination and discipline allow him or her to break through the limitations of the body into the world of the soul where body and soul have become one.I highly recommend this book for athletes and everyone who is determined to pursue a goal greater than one's own perceived limitations.Murray Bodo"
3,mixed feelings,"I was intrigued by Cain's character, which broke the noble, just, upright molds of most fantasy heroes. He's a gritty, harsh man who, realistically, was shaped by his childhood. The villain, Maelkoth, was almost likable; indeed, he was ponderously regal. The concept of inter-dimensional travel between the world of ""faerie"" and our contemporary one being explained scientifically was also well done.However, the brutality described in many of the scenes disturbed me, all the more so because such things happen all too often in our society. There was a grim bitterness that laced the pages of the entire book that left me drained by the time I finished.Read it for the realism of life's harshness; but don't read it if you don't like to envision suffering and anguish in Technicolor."
4,great but preachy,"I love the character,Hari michaelson, especially as Caine. The story is really well written and holds your interest. It is a great read. The only problem I had with it was the over the top anti-capitalist, radical environmentalist point of view that was piled on with a steam shovel. In a future world where they can travel to another planet without a space craft, they still cannot gather resources without destroying the countryside. The, man is the evil destroyer of the planet, story line gets a little old as well. Still the writing is good and if you can get past the radical environmental [stuff], I think you will enjoy it."
2,Most reviews overblown...,"This is a talented attempt to continue the saga begun with Heroes Die. Unfortunately, the writer cripples (in more ways than one) the protanist for well over half of the 800 pages. He is crippled mentally and physically. He doesn't do ANYTHING (other than get beat upon). He whines, self-pities and gets beat upon till he is simply not the character created in the first book.If you want to read a book where the 'bad guys' simply have their way for an eternable time with no [reader] relief, have fun. I started skipping pages after pg 300 just so I could find a place where a protaganist/antagonist action could start again. Anyhow, read it if you love the writer; otherwise, grab the synopsis and skip to the third book in the series."
3,Could have been much better,"Aside from two parts, the begining and the end, this book falls far short of both its previous companion and anything else MWS has written. Through the book we watch as Hari is tromped on and while written and told very well, the content was severly lacking. The detail of Stovers martial arts is still exceptional and is one of the redeaming qualities of this book along with his neat twist of magic. Learing about Hari in the conservatory was great, however most of the book is devoted to watching Hari whine on earth. If you buy this thats great, just don't expect anything like Hero's Die or you WILL be disappointed."
2,Forget the follow up,"I tried, really I did. After the success of ""Heroes Die"" I assumed Stover would provide a comparable sequel, he did not. This book is about 400 pages too long, the characters are simply a re-hash of the previous novel, the plot is seemingly complex but wasteful, the action is lacking, the philosophy is strained (and not helped by the constant use of the f-bomb), the author simply tried a new approach to making a good novel but his original formula should not have been altered.This novel is so bad that I feel it actually tarnishes the previous work ""Heroe's Die"". Stover has his strengths and he needs to stay with the simple, violent, seething id that is encompassed by Caine. Forget about Blade of Tyshalle, find some old George RR Martin while we all wait for A Feast for Crows."
2,It does not cover Flash MX 2004 Professional very well,"The book title tells peopple it is for Flash MX 2004 professional. However, it is not. It is just another regular Flash Mx 2004 books."
2,"Better than Flash help files, but not by much","The tutorials in this book were obviously not proofread as they are loaded with errors. If you know enough about flash to correct the errors than you can learn some things from this book, but I would highly recommend beginners to look elsewhere. The publishers site is also very poor. The book constantly refers the reader to go to the website for more tutorials, which is a complete runaround because they either don't exist, or you have to uncover them from buried articles linking to other websites! This book could have been great with better proofreading, and a CD including WORKING tutorials.The only reason I give it 2 stars instead of 1 is because it is a good overview of Flash capabilities. Just don't expect to learn the nuts and bolts of all these features from this book."
1,Hard to follow with all the typographical errors,"It's hard to say if this is a good book or not, I spent so much time trying to figure out the exercises with all the errors that I couldnt even finish the book. Many of their Figures do not match the explanations and sometimes it was so confusing that I could not complete the exercise. I would definitely not recommned this book to anyone new to flash; what a waste of money!"
3,decent material for reference,"I am a programmer who is just now diving into flash. I have purchased this. book as well as many others. Overall none of them give me what I want. I am constantly going back and forth between the books to find the answers to my questions. That said, this book has offered me some knowledge, but I have yet to see a book that is all encompassing."
1,Complete waste of money -- typos & poor web support,"One example: Chapter 15 Page 398, NOTE: ""For all examples, you can use your own external files, but for everything to be exactly as it is in the book, you should download the files for this chapter from the Web site.""(...)Another example. Chapter 1, Page 15. (Yeah, lousy from the very beginning). The code will NOT work, since there's a typo in there that involves improper capitalization, thus violating case sensitivity! I'm an intermediate-level ActionScript user, so I caught this right away, but a beginner will never realize what's wrong.The only value I can see to this book is that it has a chapter on integrating Flash with PHP, which is a rarity among books on server-side Flash. But I haven't gotten to this chapter yet, so I don't know whether they've loused this up too.This is a typical SAMS book. In other words, a nearly complete waste of money."
2,Lots of Detail But...,"The writing's pretty thin in places and the jargon comes heavy. Concepts are presented hierarchically rather than cognitively (e.g. the chapter on components immediately dives into how to insert them into a Flash movie without first explaining what they are). Also, be warned that the sample files and source code isn't easily accessible -- there's no link given to the book's website, and if you go looking at the publisher's site you get a large zip file that's missing files referenced in the text.If you're already extremely familiar with Flash MX, this book may be fine for you. If you've had only passing contact with Flash, or are upgrading your knowledge from a previous version, save yourself the grief."
2,lost on this gamble,had a defective display...could hardly see anything...maybe the battery was dead on arrival...had to return it...may be better to buy a watch at a box retailer and pay a little more to make sure it fits and works.
5,A great new game,"The second Heroclix set (the first was Marvel Infinity Challenge), Hypertime brings us such well-known characters as Superman and Batman, a range of new superpowers, and a new base design that makes clicking the figures easier.This box contains everything you need to play, including 8 random figures, a double-sided map, Heroclix ring, dice, object tokens, and rules. I usually don't care for dice games, but I picked up one of these one day and I was hooked. I have no qualms about calling this one of the best games available today."
5,WizKids keeps on making great games!,"This is the starter for the DC Comics version of the HEROCLIX line. The Marvel Comics version has already been out, but in this version you will find such great characters as BATMAN, SUPERMAN, ROBIN, JOKER, and so on. I'd say the figures are sculpted better in this run compared to the Marvel ones. An excellent choice for the Gamer or Comic Book fan. Great product!"
2,The Ones I Didn't Get,"I did not get any figures that you showed on the pics you took. I did not get Batman, Joker or anything else. DON'T BUY, it will not give you what you want. It will not have the ones in the pictures above even though its suppose too."
3,Pricy but good!,These are top of the line candles that we have ordered year after year to augment our Christmas celebration. ...even burning.
1,The worst book about math EVER (i am being serious),"The author's main objective is to convince you how God is important.When he do talks about math or history, the result is horrible."
1,Terrible,"The whole book is infested with very annoying and irrelevantpersonal thoughts on religion. Mathematicians seem to fall in twocategories: Christian and atheist. The latter are generally eviland of little relevance, while the former are moral persons thathave produced excellent mathematics. The following quotes fromthe book illustrate its general attitude:Exercise:Even if the solar system is gravitatinally stable, it still needsGod to keep it in existence. Comment.Some historians feel that to be 'scientific' they must do theirwork on the assumption that there is no God.Laplace's greatest contribution to mathematics was his phrase'it is easy to see'."
3,Paris Hangover,"Good book for 20-30 somethings, Fun, quick read. Parts of the book are hilarious, but the constant manhunting gets a bit old. I did take notes however, on the different restos and cafes she mentions, for my future trip to Paris."
4,"How cliche, but ooh la la!","Firstly, for the reviews in the negative due to ""too much sex, little substance about Paris""....WHAT did you think you were buying? A travel memoir?? Anyone can read the back cover explicitly explaining this book was more about one woman's search for a FRENCHMAN and the guts to move somewhere....well, foreign. I found Loeb's writing style hilarious...although, like some others, it started to wane a bit towards the end, however I thoroughly enjoyed this as a time passing whirlwind (decadant) trip through Paris. It's refreshing to find a novel NOT about your typical 21 year old's study abroad time on daddy's dime, and while this book is full of frivolous parties and casual sex, it's also much more 'adult' than many novels of the same genre. Overall, very good and worth its price."
2,Too many typos,"The editors of this book did its author no favours at all. It has all the faults of a book edited and proof-read by computer: homophones galore, mis-spelled French names and misunderstood French culture. Quite a disgrace, actually.Also, Paris-lovers beware! The book's setting is almost exclusively the parts of Paris inhabited by rich Americans, not the real Paris."
3,No brain fare....,"I read this book in about three days. Immediately, I was disgusted at all the designer names the author dropped. Yet, the author tried to play the main character Klein to be this down to earth girl who doesn't have two dimes to rub together. It was really difficult for me personally to feel empathy for Klein, she wasn't very relateable and incredibly superficial. And, believe me she would have had to be a millionaire to dress the way the books depicts her. Turning to the back of the book it looks to me like this is more of a semi-biography with a few outrageous tidbits thrown in. I was looking for a book about an American in Paris. A woman's perspective rather than a male (i.e. Peter Mayle--I have read his lovely books too). I just didn't feel that this book was that entertaining sans the various exploits of her MANY French boyfriends. I wouldn't recommend this book."
2,Did not like!,"So pretentious and full of herself! I purchased this to read on my trip to Paris and nearly threw it out. If not for her references to significant Paris monuments and some of the cultural nuances of the Parisians, I would have tossed this and given it only one star. I'm not terrible serious or prudish, however her writing really seem contrived in order to shock you."
1,Not a good book AT all,"This book is very very dull...I didn't know half of what the author was trying to point out and what the hell she was talking about! I love everything about Paris, so when I saw this book I thought, ""Ok, this should be a pretty decent book. It is about fashion and escaping to wonderful Paris."" BUT no. I actually returned this book because I just didn't want this book to be on my shelf period...I read the first few chapters and I couldn't take it anymore, it was giving me a headache! I am def going to look closer to the books I choose."
2,Disappointed......,"I hate to be negative about a book....but.....I also have to admit the book started out great. It was laugh-out-loud funny. Especially during the flight from NYC to Paris with her cat.Shortly after that, it appeared to lose it's steam and my interest.I did finish it...but I had to struggle.If you're into those stiletto heels, looking for Mr. Right by romping in bed with every male that comes along (and sometimes two)and you're fine with reading a novel that lacks any ""substance"" with a main character that should have ""shallow"" for her middle name.....then this book is for you!"
3,Item not as pictured,"The item pictured was a 16 oz pump bottle. Instead, I received two 8 oz non-pump bottles. Not a big deal. It's still a great product, but the item was not as pictured."
4,Great Product for a Floridian,"If you live in Florida and like going to the beach regularly, then this product is for you! I haven't had any problems worth mentioning, so far so good!"
3,lotion,"I was expecting this lotion to go on a little smoother. It was all in all ok, but nothing any other drug store lotion wouldn't do."
3,Doesn't work with CFL bulbs,"We have 5 of these lights on our house that were installed 4 years ago when the house was built. Three on outside of garage that faces Southwest in direct sunlight, began giving problems after about 2 years. The dark tinted plastic light sensor cover located on the face, dry rotted and broke apart after about 2 years and with that the problems started, wont shut off during daylight, and occasionally, will not come on after dusk. They have a 5 year warranty on them though so I will try to have them replaced. Motion sensor works well though, goes from a very low power, low light, to high, full power when sensing movement. It's a great feature when coming up the driveway at night. One problem with it though, the high/low dimming will not work with CFL power saver bulbs, a real consideration in todays need to conserve energy. The fixtures look good adding a nice touch of class to the exterior of the house."
3,OK aluminum lantern.,"this light come with many function and chamfered glass make it look very nice, easy to install. the two screw for changing the light bulb is on top let hope water doesn't go in and ruin it. only complain is the sensitivity adjustment is in the back of the mounting area so once it mount secure into the area you can't adjust this, must adjust this before install is a big no no. all other setting is in the bottom of the mounting area easily adjust when finish installed.edit after 1-2 years of owning this product.i have issue with the motion sensor on both light, auto on/off suck doesn't work anymore and i can't use this with fluorescent bulbs. i end up open the thing and completely remove the motion sensor module in the back of the light. now it just on or off at the switch.i change from great lantern to OK latern and from 4stars to 3stars now.there are plenty of better light out there keep on searching, i don't recommend this item."
2,Take your chances on these...,"I have 3 of these. They were on a house which we recently bought. I noticed they were not coming on at night all the time. Then, I noticed 2 of the 3 dont shut off by themselves in daylight. I have to shut them off at the switch inside. Once I do that, they seem to ""reset"", and usually come back on at night, but the same 2 never shut off during the day. At least they haven't yet. Called the company tech support, they told me to replace the entire units as the photo cell is bad and that part alone can't be replaced. Seems like they should last forever. I don't think these are that old.I would recommend finding another brand. I found similar complaints about Heath Zenith products all over the web."
5,simple elegance,"Bought two of these outdoor lamps for the garage to complete redo of our home. I'm glad to find cast aluminum lamps that look this good. I love the tasteful, elegant yet simple look. I like the independent motion-sensor lighting which doesn't overpower the area yet gives plenty of light. I'm very happy with my purchase."
1,Quit working after 2 months,"We ordered this to replace the fixture outside a home we purchased a few months ago. Installed easily, looked great, worked for about 2 months. One day it randomly quit working. Im beyond frustrated. How could it stop working already? Definitely not worth the hassle and frustration. Don't buy."
3,"Looks nice, but not 180 degree motion detection","This fixture looks very nice when I installed it yesterday, but I'm a bit disappointed that the motion detection isn't 180 degrees like it says on the box. It's more like 150.Other than than it's good."
1,Artificial flavor? Why?!?,"Besides artificial vanilla Cadbury chocolate often contains artificial flavor, which, to me leaves an odd aftertaste.Artificial flavor is ""flavor"" created in a lab and tested on lab rats to keep them eating. Why does it need to be added to chocolate!?!?Poor disingenuous product as far as I see it"
3,Texture was not as I remembered.....,"I was expecting them to be solid and smooth, but the seemed be full of bubbles and not like I remember"
2,Buy one with a numerical read out,"Bought my CP9015 locally, not through Amazon.I regret this purchase.You have to count the pulses (flashing light and beeps) to read trouble codes. With three digit trouble codes, up to about 500, this meter and all others like it are very difficult to use.If your vehicle has multiple trouble codes stored, it is very difficult to know where one code starts and the other ends. If you're just one off due to miscount, or confuse the start of one code for the end of the previous code, you'll waste time and money investigating and replacing the wrong components.For about $10 more, you can get an ODB-1 code reader with a numeric read out, which eliminates counting flashes and beeps."
5,A great tool for older cars.,Make sure you have the correct scanner for your car. Get a piece of paper and a pen and you are ready.This unit plugs in easily and works like a charm. If you don't have the codes in a service manual they are easily found on the internet. Convenient and inexpensive...why not have this tool in your car and make your life easier? Makes the check engine light much less traumatic!
4,For what its worth,"Buffalo Springfield out of the dark and into the light. Its a wonderful box which gives great credit to the group who is know by the people with a few songs. But they made much, much, much more. And you get an impression of what lay ahead for some of the members. For what its worth this box is a starting point to Neil Young and the other members. But together they are great. Everyone should buy it, not only people who like this kind of muisc but every musiclover."
3,A so-so box set,"I waited with great anticipation for this release. I like much of the music that the Buffalo Sprinfield made. But this boxset falls short. Mainly what you get are short guitar and vocaltracks only. That's great! But what made this band wasthe band playing together. There are no live tracks and soyou don't get any magic that the band produced as a whole. Instead, you get individual tracks. A few from Neil, a few from Steven Stills. They sound great and I love them. But what madethis band was their collective output as a band. And you don'tget that at all from this box set. In short, what you get areouttakes from the individual composers but no outtakes from the band.I don't think this box set does much to enshrine the Buffalo Sprinfield as the greatest folk/rock band of the mid sixties."
4,almost perfect,Plus side: 1.) 22 demos! 2.) 6 remixes! Minus side: 1.) NO extended bluebird! 2.) 21 songs REPEATED TWICE! 3.) 3 songs off the last LP NOT EVEN INCLUDED! 4.) NO LIVE CUTS ! (I don't care how lousy they sound to Neil!)It doesn't take much to figure out what could have been...
4,MoreShakeyPls.,"I've listened to this box set quite a lot over the past few weeks and like it very much. My little joke is to say ""there is only one thing wrong with it?"" to people. When they say ""what""? I say ""Steve Stills""....but its just a joke. The Sarge is fine. My real complaint/wonder is why we didn't get versions of Neil singing his great songs? ""On the Way Home"", ""Clancy"", & ""Do I have to Come Right Out and Say It"".....these are such beautiful songs and while Richie sings them nicely, I really need to hear Neil sing them. Does anyone know where I might find such a thing? Are they being saved for the Neil Box Set? Keep on rockin' in the free world."
2,The Byrds wrote the blueprint,"Nothing to add to the other reviews criticising the duplications, the omissions and the price, but just to add one observation: Just as the Byrds provided the sonic blueprint for the Springfield in the 60s, they (and with Sony) provided the model for how to do CD reissues:(1) Take each of the original albums and remaster to the highest standard of sound(2) Add lots of bonus tracks (singles, B-sides, outtakes and demos) from the appropriate period of the band's history(3) Provide well-written and informative sleeve notes (4) Retain all original artwork and enhance with period photos, advertisements, posters, etc.(5) Find a classic unreleased live performance and add as a separate new album(6) Release (in chronological order) at mid-priceIf Sony/Columbia/McGuinn can do it properly, I don't see why Rhino/Atco/Stills&Young can't.The music is great, but as a box set this is a non-starter."
2,Less CAN be more.,"I've always liked these guys, but this is a mess: table scraps, studio banter, amplified clicks and pops. Look, there was only so much good music this unlikely and short-lived group was capable of, and it sure wasn't sufficient to spread over four CD's. Even some of their best songs were poorly recorded, especially on their debut. In places they sound like a garage band. And Stills, with his sophomoric lyrics, deserved less air time. Save your money, buy the second album and let Buffalo Springfield rest in peace."
3,"Good music, but bloated","This box set has two CD's more than necessary. Several of these songs are repeated two to three times! After owning this box set for a few weeks, I decided to make my own compilation and burn it onto a CD. I only needed TWO 80 minute cd's to fit every single unique song (no duplicate songs), without leaving anything out. It's just startling that there is so much duplication on this box set when there are still tracks missing from ""Last Time Around""!"
2,WARNING -- READ BEFORE YOU BUY!!!,"This box set was a huge disappointment. Not because of the music (which is excellent), but because it is not comprehensive (some key songs are missing) and all the songs on the entire 4th are included elsewhere on the other 3 CD'S! They should have put four albums on 2 CD's (the three regular albums along with the unreleased ""Stampede"") and made 2 CD's of live and previously unreleased songs.I suspect this was out of (surprise! surprise!) greed on the part of the record company, forcing the consumer to buy a whole extra CD for two or three missing songs.And record companies wonder why people prefer to get their music from the internet..."
2,poor collection,"I've seen this group perform in person. They brought the house down. I brought this box set hoping to get most of the music they did. I was kinda dissappointed in the box set. Why didn't they put in live tracks in the fourth CD. Instead putting the same songs they had in the other CD's? You are better off in buying the single CD's, then spending the sixty dollars or so on this box set. Even though they only had a two year stint they had big influence in the music of that era and even today."
4,what an awesome collection of talent this was,"I don't understand Neil Young's choices for the box set, especially some of the duller demos and the many repeated stereo tracks (I appreciate having the mono version of their first album). But the best stuff on here as about as good as it gets for 60's pop. Young was brilliant from the start and evidently felt unappreciated. But the revelation on this set is a quartet of Stills demos (""So You got a Lover"", ""My Angel"", ""Hung Upside Down"", and ""Four Days Gone""), every bit as breathtaking as those George Harrison numbers on Beatle Anthology 3. Also thoroughly enjoyed Young's ""One More Sign"" and ""Falcon Lake"". Furay was a terrific singer, foreground or background, and Palmer was an innovator on bass right up there with contemporaries McCartney and Entwhistle. Lots of great music in this box."
2,Burned,"This has to qualify for disappointment of the year. A seemingly endless batch of hit-and-miss demos and outtakes are mixed in with the released masterpieces, making for a tedious listen. In the end, this box diminishes the band's legacy instead of immortalizing it. The final insult: three songs from Last Time Around are arbitrarily deleted while the tracks from albums one and two appear twice -- and you STILL need to go elsewhere for a stereo mix of the debut outing. It's hard to miss Neil Young's ongoing contempt for his audience. The label could have squeezed all three original albums and at least 40 minutes of the worthy outtakes onto a double disc. A waste."
3,"Good, but not great...","My child says he learned a lot from this video, primarily about maintenance of roller coasters. He said he also learned from the interviews with the people who designed the roller coasters. However, he likes video footage from the front seat on roller coasters and there was little of this."
2,Not for cheap Radio Shack phones,"Instructions were good. Headset comfort was great. Despite trying all of the steps for removing LOUD STATIC, I was not able to get equipment to operate well.Used my sister on the other end while I tried all of the settings. I returned this item with no problem, but I think we should be told up front that it will not work with a Radio Shack 2.4GHz phone."
4,Plantronics CS55H Wireless Headset W Adapter for Cordless Telephones (,"Having a call waiting feature would make this set perfect.The set does allow for complete freedom with hands free, nothing to tote around with you and no compromise to physical position.HOW TO HANDLE CALL WAITINGUsing head set: call waiting beep occurs1 Ask person #1 to hang on2 Turn on handset3 Turn off headset4 Press flash to transfer to person #2 on ""call waiting""5 Press flash to transfer to person number 16 Turn on headset and continue with person #1OR1 Tell person #1 that you'll call them back as soon as you take the call on call waiting.2 Turn off headset3 Wait for ring4 Turn on headset and take call5 Call person #1Chatting with a friend while doing mundane house work allows me to be able to discuss world news and hypothetically solve all of the world's problems. The best part is that house work is done with hardly being aware of doing it."
2,Frustrating and inconsistant,"When this product works for me, it is very good. The sound quality is good and I am well heard by people on the other end of the line. The range is also excellent. My one complaint and it is major is that the phone does not pick up when I press the call receive button on the headset. It frequently beeps or does not respond and sometimes picks up well after I have begun using my hand held. So I would not recommend this product for that reason alone."
1,Mute functionality is ridiculous,"When you mute this headset, it will send a series of 3 beeps every 10 seconds to indicate to you that it's muted. The beeps are fairly loud (enough to possibly miss something said in the conversation), and the pitch is extremely annoying.Other then the mute, the headset was absolutely perfect.So in my case, I work from home, and I'm on a ton of conference calls. I have it on mute unless I'm talking so other people don't hear my dog, street noise, etc. So, I had to return it after a week.In summary, if you use mute, you won't be able to use this. If you don't need mute, I envy you, and you will have the perfect earpiece!"
3,Not current enough,"I looked forward to this book, expecting it would contain the answers to many questions I had about using Premiere Pro. It had some, but it's talking about the very first version of the program included with the very first version of the Creative Suite concept. Because the technology is now at least 5 years and five iterations of the program out of date, it makes for a very confusing purchase. Although well written and comprensive for it's time, it's simply too many years behind the technology to be of use, at least to me.I eventually bought the Premiere Pro CS4 Classroom in a book, which I found lucid and sufficiently up to date for my purposes."
3,Sams Teach Yourself Adobe Premiere Pro in 24 Hours,Highly recommend for someone whose never used Premiere Pro. Easy to follow and provides good advice and tips.
3,Premier Pro in 24 hours,"I think the book is a good one. I have learned a number of things from it, unfortunately is is for a very old version of Premier Pro and the interface has changed so it is difficult at times to apply the text to the newest version of Premier Pro.I do like the fact that the booth spends much of the first lessons on how to create a video from the story telling point of view. The sections from various other people I found to be very insightful."
4,Fat Loss Monitor,"I have been training in the gym for a few years now, and needed a device to monitor my progress. This is a really good tool to monitor your progress. I personally don't think it's 100 percent accurate, but it measures consistantly. I say go for it!"
5,Best product,"It is easy to use, easy to program. Helps keeps you aware of your weight loss journey. Must add to your weight loss equipment."
3,not very accurate,"This gives you a good ballpark range, but varies so incredibly day to day it's hard to notice significant changes."
3,E4 Error,I bought the fat analyzer and it always gives an E4 error on my 24 year old son. He is very strong healthy and lean. Does this mean his body fat is so low it's out of range? Why such a narrow margin? As for me the numbers seem consistent but I really question it's accuracy. I wonder if the unit predominately works using a per-programmed estimate based on the variables that you type in.The BMI is nothing more than a generic formula so I wonder the same for the fat analyzer.If anyone has a link to references with hard data for this unit please post them in response to my review.
3,It does what it supouse to.... not sure how well it does it though,I have never take the water tank or caliper test so I'm not sure if the reading I get is accurate or not. I give it only 3 stars because if I take 10 readings one after another I get 10 different results. Not sure if this is normal or not but this seems odd to me even though the results are not too far apart.The device itself is easy to use and setup just read the instructions first as the proper holding and posture is crucial for a good reading.
5,Excellent product,Excellent product and simple to use. Can be used for health screening and health fairs. Very good and straight-forward instructions.
2,it does give a percentage.,"Well, this thing gives a percentage. I am not sure whether it is correct or not and how it compare with a scale or other measurement methods. What I noticed though, is that interestingly after having lost ~10 pounds the percentage went 3% up. Now since I lost weight and I did cycling 3x a week and weight lifting (chalean extreme) 3x a week, I really really do doubt that the measurement is correct.And I tested morning, midday and evening before and after meals and before and after workout and it does stay within a 0.3% difference. Of course that just may be another sign of impreciseness. I still use it once in a while just for fun, but I would not buy it again."
4,Seems Accurate,"We use this every day so that we can trend our body fat percentage. It's easy to use, and gives you a reading in seconds."
4,Omron HBF-306C Fat Loss Monitor,"Omron HBF-306C Fat Loss Monitor:The monitor works very well and is really accurate. I have the older versionand was happy with it. The new features are worth the upgrade. My onlypeeve is that the unit does not have the same or equal feel as the older version.It feels cheaper and is a little harder to use, but that doesn't matter becauseit is still such a good product."
2,Just a clarification,BMI should not be confused with body fat percentage--there is no formula for body fat percentage and using a device like this one can be an accurate method of determining body fat percentage.
4,good product,dont know how accurate it is. was for my friend who is trying special diet. for me not so helpful and i do not really trust it either. i would go to the gym and keep my own things going
2,Is Calculated Number Bogus or Real?,"Seems like the resulting body fat number is based more on your age and weight than on the electric current flowing through your body. Results are significantly different when you enter different values ... can somebody explain WHY it should matter? I'm 67, 5' 6"" and weigh 141. This device doesn't even allow you to enter an age greater than 60. I guess they figure if you're over 60, you're too senile to care about your weight or appearance. Actually, it's even worse than that. Certain combinations of weight, age and height throw an ERROR when you try to enter them for your profile. So even their ALGORITHM is flawed. I'm almost thinking that the device is a sham and that the calculations aren't based on electric current, but simply the numbers you enter for your age/height/weight/sex ... in other words: the electric current part of the equation ... is BOGUS."
3,"Omron HBF-306C Fat Loss Monitor, Black",it was rather difficult to get it working the first time its ok i guess would not buy again any time soon.
2,Not worth the money.,"I have used this about twice, I dont find it accurate at all. The mirror is a better scale to judge on."
4,Works well if you use it right,"I wanted to write a review to explain why people say ""the readings vary significantly"". If you read the instructions it says to hold the device at arms length. Holding it at arms length I scored 19.5%, holding it with my arms bent at a 45 degree angle I scored 17%, and holding it up against my body I scored 13%. If you use it right this device is excellent for what it is meant for."
4,Great product for a great price,"I am finding this item to be invaluable for ensuring that I'm dropping fat while retaining muscle during my cut.I use it at the same time every Sunday morning which allows me to tweak my macronutrients as i see fit based on my weekly results. I'm not sure why they included a BMI calculator as it forces me to input me height, weight and age every week which gets old but you're still only talking about a 5 minute investment for an accurate snap shot of your weekly improvement. Very happy with this purchase."
1,Great random number generator,"If you're looking for an inexpensive device to generate random numbers, the HBF-306C is ideal. But if you're trying to measure your body fat, its pretty useless. Despite following the directions and taking measurements at the same time every day, the numbers displayed fluctuated all over the place. My intent was to use this as part of diet program where during the weeks when my weight didn't go down, I'd see a change in fat percentage. But, despite losing about 25 pounds over the better part of a year, and having ample visual evidence that my fat percentage was lower, the HBF-306C gave me no useful information. Possibly other techniques such as ultrasound or caliper would have given better results; I didn't try either. But this gadget was definitely not worthwhile."
2,A waste of money,"My gym had this fat analyzer free to use, and so my friend and I tried it. His body fat is around 7-8 percent and mine is around 14-15. After entering all of our necessary information, and completing the test, my buddy came up at 12% and me at 10?! I don't know what that thing was measuring, but it certainly wasn't accurate."
2,Off by 6% consistently,"Having owned and routinely used 3 different scale and body fat analyzers as well as having the gold standard submersion test and the new volumetric air analysis method, I can verify that the Omron HBF-306C is off by at least 6% consistently. Tanita and Healthometer scales / body fat monitors would show my body fat betwee 8.4% and 11.5% generally depending on my hydration level. The submersion and volumetric air tests both showed between 8.5% and 9.2% over several readings. Hats off to Tanita and Healthometer!Omron's handy HBF-306C always reads 16%+!!After working out consistently for 25 years, eating the Body for Life way and wearing he same waste size I did in highschool ... I know the Omron is not accurate. Handy - yes. Accurate - not even close.Buyer beware and be able to subtract 6%!"
4,Good for quick and easy progress check,"I have used similar or the same brand fat monitor at my gyms (urban active, curves, and crunch).They seem to be slightly temperamental- be sure to follow directions. I think they are great to easily & quickly, (and less embarrassing) way to find your body fat, and progress on your fitness journey. The best way to find your body fat is w/ the clamps, but this is hard to do on your own, and time consuming."
4,Couple Months of Use,"I've used the monitor for a couple months now without any issues. I have 3 profiles programmed, my girlfriend, a gym partner, and myself. Everything has functioned without flaw every use. My only minor complaint is that it doesn't feel as solid as it could. I do sometimes worry about it being damaged in my gym bag as it gets tossed in and out of lockers. Satisfied customer!"
2,It's not very accurate for me.,"I bought this and the AM-3000 Fitness 3000 Personal Body Fat Tester Kit. When I tried the Omron Fat Loss monitor, it said I had 10% body fat. Though it is kind of flattering, this is simply not true. The Body Fat tester kit was more accurate with a measurement of 16% body fat.I would suggest measuring your BF% with a caliper for a more accurate measurement."
5,Omron is simple to use,My husband and I both love this product. It is very easy to use and we use it with our P90X program. Good product.
4,"good buy, recommended","Definetely easy to use. Just as accurate as the more high tech one at the gym, but without all the curious rubberneck people watching as you weigh yourself. I like how you can save your information on it. I just wish they would make a smaller model that would make it easier to use and store. This things kind of dinosaur sized as far as modern electronics go."
5,Fabulous!,"I love this little gadget! Easy to use, and very inexpensive. Can store multiple peoples' height, weight, gender data super easily. Glad I got it! Will be rewarding to measure fat loss over the course of my fitness quest. A ""pounds"" scale is just not the best fitness measure for someone who is not significantly overweight."
4,Very easy to use,"As always omron has made a very good reliable measuring device, it is very easy to use and to prgram , and take the measurment in seconds, the reason that i gave it 4 stars is the fact that it does not keep a log of the previuos measurments,so that I can keep track of my progress"
4,Omron Body Fat Analyzer,I use this product almost daily with my personal training and weight loss clients and like it very much. Amazon also has the best price on this product.
1,Very Inaccurate,"This device is so inaccurate that it's not only out of the ballpark, it's not even in the same county.We have one of these at our fitness center where I work and it is consistently WAY off. According to a professional-grade scanner (InBody 230) and (and confirmed with caliper testing), my body fat percentage is 10-10.5%. The Omron HBF-306 monitor most recently reported my body fat % as 17.3. That's an absolute error of at least 6.8% and a relative error of at least 64%. With that kind of inaccuracy, what's the point?The price makes it appealing, but for the same price, you're better off getting a quality caliper and tape measure set. Not as convenient, but far more accurate."
2,Flawed!,"I have used various methods to determine my body fat percentage. This includes, Taylor scales with impedance features, bodyfat calipers, and even formula based on bodypart measurements. All of these methods are comparable by 2-3%. However, I decided to buy the Omron with hopes it would be a convenient way to measure my bodyfat. I was highly disappointed. I have tried it several times and each time it says that I am 8% lower in bodyfat than the other methods mentioned above. It could be a usable tool if it were 2-5% off but at 8% off it's unusable.I would recommend Accu-Measure skinfold calipers instead. They are half the cost and twice as accurate."
2,Okie dokie,"Not at all accurate. I take readings in the morning after I wake up and everytime I take at least 5 different readings and try to average out to the correct one - and believe me, it shows a different result each time (even though I do it repeatedly without any break)"
5,Does the job!,"Got this 2wks ago, from Amazon. It does a great job. Very easy to use. The results from this little gadget got me started back to the gym, which is important.My numbers were way too much! Diabetes, and heart disease run in my family. Wish I had gotten this earlier, maybe I would have started back to gym earlier..... Buy it, it works"
2,Still just a science project.,"This product isn't as accurate as it claims itself to be. Sure, it'll get you somewhat close to your actual body-fat percentage, but it doesn't give those results consistently enough, and only raises my skepticism. Between one moment and the next, you could see a difference of 1-4% in the readings. I've done very well to follow all of the directions both in the manual, and in a comment left by someone in the review section here on Amazon. My suggestion is to spend the money towards a pair of calipers and take time learning how to use them properly. If you don't mind your readings being off slightly (or massively depending on the time of day) then you can do with the Omron HBF-360C... Otherwise, it really isn't worth your time. It's still just a science project with lots of experimenting and refining to do."
4,Great value,Great value for your money. It does what it's supposed to do... nothing fancy. Bought another one last year and haven't had any problems so far.
5,within 1% of my underwater bodyfat results,"In the 3 years that I've owned this I've found it to be surprisingly accurate, even when I'd rather it not be ;-) My results have varied between 11 and 16% over the past few years and each time I check it against another method I find they're in agreement. Skin caliper and professional underwater bodyfat testing results have both been within 1% of the results I get with this, and testing with the Omron is easy to do on my own. I first purchased it after seeing it was what personal trainers at my local gym used, and then last year when my health insurance company was doing physical assessments they brought the same Omron monitor."
4,Fat monitor-good deal,"not a super advacanced system but consistent with more expensive models I have tried. Best when going to be used with the same repeated people, then you can get a reliable trend."
4,Great product.,"This thing works great. Remember, it's the amount of body fat you lose not the weight, so this thing checks your body fat and BMI. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because if I check my body fat four or 5 times in a row it varies by as much as 0.3%. Wish there was less variation in it, but other than that....it's great. I would definitely buy again."
4,Like it!,"It's very easy to use! If you do it every day, different times of days, it will give you different readings. I'm sticking to once a week at the same time before doing any exercise or eating or drinking anything. I know the BMI is accurate, but that's because you input your height and weight."
1,Too tall for device,"So I purchased this to help provide further information for me as I attempted to lose a lot of weight and get in better shape. So far, it has worked great, BUT I am 6 foot 9 inches tall, and the machine caps out at a max height of 6'6"". I came close to maxing out the max weight for the device as well which is 440 lbs.So if you are taller then 6'6"" or heavier then 440 lbs, do not purchase this device."
4,Good but not perfect,"I got this item after reading the reviews. It seemed like a lot of people just weren't following the directions properly so I ordered. I follow the directions to the letter and have had positive but somewhat mixed results. Disclaimer: I am tall 6'6'' and muscular (although not as lean as I could be). The absolute level of body fat seems 5 or 6 % points high to me, although its possible it is correct. Directionaly it is correct. Meaning, when I lose fat (based on looking in the mirror) the body fat % goes down. The BMI monitor is where I have issues. This also has to do with the way BMI is calculated in general but it says I am ""Very High"" or well over the efficient ratio, when that is just not the case. Overall it is a good way to monitor progress regarding fat loss but maybe not THE most accurate way for absolute %. I will give credit in that there aren't many ways to do this accurately, especially at home."
2,Not for Obesity,I don't know if the product does what its supposed to because if you are over 250lbs it doesn't display the fat percentage. This should have been explained in the description.
3,"Good quality over price, but lacks accuracy","I've first seen this Omron at my nutritionist. She used to measure me and tell me about my status, so I thought it'd be great to have one at home.I've ordered this from Amazon, good price, came very fast, but it's not accurate. This monitor showed me a very flattering Fat mass, with about 7% less than the one used by my nutritionist. Hers is from Europe and uses the metric system, but it's the same product.I've measured my family and we got some incredible values, like 8% fat for my brother - ok, he might be skinny, but not THAT skinny.So I recommend adding up some 6-7% when using this for measure.It is a good product, with the 10 profiles, and it's a great instrument when you wanna lose body fat. Just keep in mind it shows a bit less fat than what you actually have"
4,Omron HBF-360C Fat Loss Monitor,"This monitor is accurate and has received good reviews. It is the same one used by gyms. No device is perfectly accurate when it comes to measuring fat percentagess, but this device will accurately inform you as to the general trend in your fat loss, i.e., are you increasing your fat or losing it?"
4,The athlete live ends 60,"The product seems ok. There is two options about profiles. Normal or athletic. You can set the age between 18 to 60 in the ATHLETIC mode. No more, no less. I bought the product one mounth ago and I'll be 61 years old on march,30. So I'll have to trow it out cause I intend don't stopping cycling for while."
1,Gives Error Msg - Over 300lbs,This product does not work for the extremely overweight. It does NOT say the the item description that (like most scales) it does NOT take measurements if you weigh over 300lbs. You have to search through the enclosed instruction booklet to find this out after getting repeated error messages.
3,Not accurate,"I used this as a personal trainer in a gym after using the calipers for months. This was inaccurate. In playing around with it amongst the other staff, it seemed to jump greatly from one percentage to the next in a short period of time. For a client, it read 13% one week and when he asked to see it the next week, 16%. [This was left on the ""normal"" setting for both readings] And to express to him the variances in accuracy of different devices, I took his body fat with calipers. It was neither of these percentages. To someone focusing on body fat (bodybuilder or bikini competitor), the difference between 13% and 16% is vast. This will help if you are overweight and need a ballpark figure for a before and an after (where accuracy isn't all so important)- ie: just to know that you were once in the 40s and want to be in the early 20s"
4,"great instrument, very useful","For those thinking they can get scientific lab-quality results, you are having too high expectations.what you will get tho, is the ability to accurately measure your BMI to standards never available before in home use. this is a handy tool. if you are a body builder or athlete of any kind its almost essential to own."
1,IT DOES NOT WORK,"IT GIVES HIGHLY INCORRECT RESULTS. SOME TESTS ARE 50 % DIFFERENT FROM OTHERS AND ALL ARE WRONG.I HAVE OTHER TESTS FOR BODY FAT, SUCH AS A SCALE. I HOPED THAT THIS WOULD EASIER TO USE.THE RESULTS ARE GROSSLY WRONG."
1,Does not measure body fat!,"This ONLY calculates the data you enter into it it does NOT pick anything up from the hand held ""sensors"" it's no different than punching in your numbers in n on-line body fat calculator! DO NOT waste your money peeps!"
3,its okay,"depends on if you are standing, sitting, laying down. the percentage is different. so I guess if your position is right, then its accurate."
3,"Different readings but great for ""Just wondering"" situations..","I bought this product after having been taped for my body fat and told that in 2 months i had gaineds about 6-7% body fat. It was surprisingly easy to step up and use. After awhile though i started to use it more than once, testing back to back. One day i did it 5 times and got 5 different ratings. for body fat there was a .5 marginal difference(30.0-30.5). I had to choose best 3 out of 5 and stick with that! The good thing, i guess, was that my BMI stayed the same.This item is great for people who want to get a gist of their BF and BMI.For serious people with issues with weight or have a goal or BF/BMI to meet dont use this unless youve got a backup somewhere. I am buying another product to bounce this off with. I still use it because i love the quick and fast wishy-washy results!So because i have to choose best 3 out of 5, and cant REALLY trust the output this product dishes, this product gets 3 out of 5 stars!"
2,Ugh,"I dropped 15 lbs and it said I simply loss .3% body weight. If you have a muscular built, and I mean lean muscle with moderate amount of fat, then this product will not work for you."
3,It is what it is; not very accurate but a ballpark idea.,Electric fat tests are not an exact science. It gives you a +/- picture of your current fat percentage but I do not feel like it is a very accurate assesment. One of my friends is WAY into Crossfit and has a much lower BMI than I do. I am not stupid and followed the instructions and it gave us both the same result. Now I know I am pretty sexy and everything but I do have a spare tire. So if it was a sexy meter maybe but since it's a fat loss monitor not.
4,Quick and easy to use,"I work in a human performance lab at my school and we use this product daily as part of our assessments. it works for about 95% of the people who use it. the other percentage it gives an error message and we do not know why this happens for some people and not others. usually comes within +/- 3 or 4 of skinfold assessmentsone thing is to make sure you weight yourself with an ACCURATE scale EVERY time you use this because small changes in weight input can effect the readingalso, it is sensitive to your hydration level so try to do it at the same time everyday (preferably pre-exercise) and at a similar hydration level.overall this is great for mass use, as we have hundreds of people come through the lab every semester, but as a professional i would rather use skinfolds because it is more accurate and less depending on variables."
2,Their Algorithms automatically increase fat percentage as age increases,Very disappointing... Been using it for several years. and Getting leaner each year (by other tests).this device assumes body fat percentage goes up with age. So even if you get leaner it may report more body fat.
1,Totally Worthless,This product is inconsistent. I can take five different readings in a row and receive five widely ranging different results. Save your money and look up the Navy body fat formula instead.
2,Not worth the price,"I used it eactly as directed, but it does not seem to be very accurate. Feel like I wasted 30 bucks. I just use a bathroom scale once or twice a week and monitor how my clothes fit. Wish I'd listened to other reviews. Now I have an expensive paper weight."
3,you still need to carefully weigh yourself before using the fat loss monitor,"After discovering the weak heel of this product, it does make total sense - you must type in your current weight each time you use the Omron Fat Loss Monitor. Since it is not a scale, this does make perfect sense in hindsight. For me, it makes even more sense to get a scale that takes care of fat monitoring as well as weighing - there are a few on Amazon with quite good ratings that are not too much more expensive than this handheld unit.I ended up sending this back and getting an Omron body composition monitor and scale which seems to work fairly well."
4,Pretty nice,I find it accurate enough. I only use it once a month though and I am constantly losing being on Weight Watchers. It goes down as my weight goes down and I never get a different result when checking a few minutes later. If so it is just by a point or two tops. I would recommend it if you are wanting to rely on a measuring device other than the scale and tape measure. Nice to have all 3 to compare results with
3,OK product for an affordable price but not really accurate,"I compared the readings from the Omron HBF-306C with a very accurate fat measuring scale (used for measuring bariatric patients prior to surgery) at the hospital I work at and the Omron reads about 7% lower than your actual body fat measurement. So as long as you realize that it is off by A LOT, then get it and just add 7% to the measurement you get from the Omron."
3,Fat loss monitor review,Works well for on the spot body comp measuring as long as the proper pre-test guidelines are followed. Pretty consistent.
4,A Must have if you're Serious about getting in shape,Healthometer 402EXP Balance Beam Doctor/Physician/Fitness Scale w/ Height-Rod (450 lbs/200 kgs) (Purchased on 03/02/2008)Very easy to operate and understand. Sturdy enough to handle the rigors of a gym setting. I think its a must have for anyone getting in shape.
5,It's fairly easy to use,"I really needed a fat monitor because I was gaining muscle mass (hopefully) and my scale couldn't tell the difference between fat and muscle weight. I've seen these machines used before, but I've never set one myself. The moment my monitor came in the mail I immediately opened it up, put my information in (without reading the instructions first) and I knew my fat percentage within minutes of opening the box. You just have to make sure all the stats are up to date or you won't get the right numbers."
2,Not very accurate.,I bought this product because I recently started working out and monitoring what I eat. I have since lost 25 pounds. I wanted to track my body fat percentage with my weight. I would not recommend this product as I believe it is not accurate at all. Since losing 25 pounds and over 4 inches on my waist it says I have not lost any body fat percentage. Which is not right when i use other calculations to figure my body fat percentage. It might be able to give you a general idea of what area you are in but would not rely on the results for tracking purposes.
3,just like the gyms...but seems very inconsistent!,"This model is just like the one at the gym! It seems to be a bit inconsistent in the reading (which is exactly what the user's guide says it would do), so I am not sure how accurate it is...but better than nothing IMO!!"
5,Get it if you care about your weight gain/loss.,"Best way to monitor your weight gain/loss is to keep track of your weight and then cross-match it with your body-fat percentage. That way you know if the weight your loosing is fat or muscle, same way goes when trying to gain weight thru muscle gain. If you keep gaining weight while your body fat is the same or better yet lowers down, your doing the right stuff.Easy to store and carry. will remember up to 9 profiles I think.Great device to have and use every day."
3,Works as said,"This fat loss tester works as described. I've noticed mine isn't that accurate, compared to other methods, but works for checking daily fat loss/gain and making sure that you are on track to reaching your goals. Price is right compared to other portable fat loss devices."
2,Not for athletes,Way off and inaccurate reading even in athlete mode. My clinic indicates 10.8% fat while Omron indicates 18% - 19%. I am toned and athletic. I train an average of 10 hours a week with varied intensities. There is no way I am in the 19% range.BMI is consistent with other body scanners I use.
5,better than just a scale,"Body composition is a better goal than just mass, as Schwarzenegger (in his prime) could have been considered obese based solely on height and weight. That said, gives consistent readings when used properly (arms parallel to floor). Now if I could only get the percentage to drop ..."
5,i can see the fat % come down,"so it's good to buy this to check yourself, although a gym can do that for you for free, but with this one you can check yourself more frequently. just remember that at different times of the day or days in the month it might show a different reading when you haven't really changed. so it's not 100% accurate but you get an idea eg you are at lets say 28% fat as opposed to closer to 20% (the variations between times of the day are smaller)"
3,Not bad,This this is only as good as the person using it and is a referance at best it work and will show loss or gain in body fat BUT.... a accurate way of doing so not so much. Best you can hope for is to take a reading log it make some progress then at the EXACT same body state IE hydration time of day before you eat so on and so take a reading and see if it changes ONLY way this works.
3,Does the Job,"I used this product in college for my nutrition class and immediately thought of it when I wanted to measure my fat percentage. It is very easy to use - not sure how completely accurate it is, though. If you are just using it to track your progress it will do the trick."
4,Great Unit. Gave expected results,"Ive bee working on getting into a healthier lifestyle and this thing is great to have. I calculated my body fat by taking measurements, weight, height, etc. This little unit was within 1% of what I calculated. Much easier than having to to do all the extra work. The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because it tends to vary results depending on what time of day I use it. Other than that, it's much better than using the scale to measure your progress. I recommend it."
5,Does what was expected,"We have had this Monitor for about 2 years and have had no problems with it. Every time we have used it, it has worked as expected. Very nice unit."
5,very accurate,This works great. I can do 4 times in a row and always get the same results. Just read & follow instuctions.
4,Great Body Fat monitor,"I had used this body fat monitor at the gym prior to purchasing so I knew the high quality product I was ordering. It came quickly and for the price is an excellent way to measure body fat in the convenience of your own home. We have 2 different people programmed into the unit and it is pretty easy to select each person. If you want to change your programmed weight (as you are losing it!) you will have to scroll through all of the entries to see what you had it set at last. It keeps your last selection, so this process is very quick.One note for tall people... It will only accurately measure for people up to 6'6"". There are no selections above that height. This was a small disappointment and not sure why they chose to stop there. We decided it can still be used to track changes and trends, even if it is not 100% accurate for guys above that height."
2,omron monitor,This does not appear to be a very high quality tool plus I have most of my residents over 80 and it does not go up to that age etc. Will most likely return or exchange for another measuring device.Omron
4,good product,"Very helpful in determining body fat. Figuring out your BMI on your own is just fine but not accurate unless you have your body fat percentage as well. This is an essential tool for anyone striving to become fit. My husband has a high BMI but a low body fat percentage. So, he is mostly muscle. I'm sure you can see where having your body fat percentage is very helpful in assessing overall fitness. Great product, and arrived at my home very quickly. They even use this same product to calculate body fat at my local YMCA!!"
3,Fat Loss Monitor != Bodyfat Monitor,"This fat loss monitor is completely inaccurate when the number is taken at face value. The *only* value of this product is to track the change in bodyfat over time if and only if you ensure the measurements are taken under the same physiological conditions, under the same environmental conditions, and your body composition is a standard deviation or two from average.This means always measure before working out, when your skin is dry, your heartrate is at resting, and while holding it properly (directly out in front of you with the arms fully extended). Write down the number, test yourself again in six weeks, and use the change in the number to determine your progress."
2,Disappointing,"I've lost 20 pounds in 6 months, but the fat percentage has barely changed. The day to day fluctuations are pretty high (up to 1%). This product didn't work for me."
1,What's it good for?,I purchased this thing several months ago. I started taking readings 3 hours after meals. The readings are all over the place. I could take readings one after the other and each one could be from .1% to 2% difference. Did I gain all that body fat in two seconds? I don't think so. I could understand one or two tenths of a point difference but 2%? Really? And it could vary as much as 5% from one day to the next. Pure waste of money.
1,DOSE NOT WORK WASTE OF MONEY,"Waste of money, dose not work. I have a six pack and it say I'm 23% bodyfat, so i did a skin fold caliper and it say 10% bodyfat, this thing is wrong, I tired it three different times and got three different readings 15% 23% and 40%, i'm a bodybuilder and a personal trainer, I would not trust this thing with any of my clients, don't waste your money, and go get your self a skin fold caliper there like 2.99."
1,:(,"I got this tool as it is really cheap and has good reviews that says it is an accurate one!however after I baught it, I don't think it is accurate at all as it give different readings in the same 5 mins!!!The BMI is ofcourse accurate as it is a simple division of hieght and weight, the main problem is the Fat % (Do not give same readings each time u use it so it is definetly not accurate at ALL!"
1,The assumptions about fat increasing with age are ridiculous,"I completely agree with Goliath. The assumption that your bodyfat ALWAYS increases with age are insane. Both my husband and I are lean and fit (intense exercise 10+ hours a week) and the numbers are ridiculous. We should be walking heart attacks according to this monitor. My trainer, with a masters in exercise physiology, thinks this item is a joke.My Tanita BC-573 makes age assumptions also but is far more accurate and realistic when it comes to the ""athlete"" mode.And, yes, we are using the unit absolutely according to the directions, tested at multiple times of day and in multiple positions just to be sure."
2,Far From Accurate!,"I recently had a body dunking that gives you the most accurate body fat reading available. I was at 13%. But I still wanted a more routine way to measure body fat so I purchased the Omron Loss Monitor. It measures me at 18%. For my money, this item is not very accurate and not worth the purchase price."
2,An Array of Readings,"This item gave me several different readings in a matter of 10 minutes. I was sure to follow the directions on how to take a reading and did exactly what it said, yet still inconsistent and by considerable margins. Not recommended."
2,"Worth The Price, Not Worth The Item.","Pros:Great shipping from Amazon.It turns on, has memory for the whole family and it gives you a sense of satisfaction for the first three days.Cons:Isn't remotely precise (measured me at 5.5% body fat, while another one measured me at 16% which at least sounds believable). It's somewhat accurate (shifts 0.5% after each consecutive measurement). Requires a lot of preparation (same time, same amount of water, two hours after lunch, etc.).Overall:I wouldn't recommend it, unless you want to see for yourself (it's not too pricey). You buy it, use it a couple of days, then it will probably sit in your closet for a long period of time."
2,inconsistent,"Product gives inconsistent readings. My weight goes down 5 lbs but % body fat goes up 3%????I have carefully followed the instructions. When I try it after I wake up, the body fat % seems to be a wild guess..."
1,Not that great,1) you need a scale handy because you need current weight for this to be accurate.2)BMI is totally inaccurate if you're an athlete/weight lifter.
5,Told me I was fat,"And I am, so that's ok I guess. I did a caliper measurement and it said I was 21% body fat. This says 23% and never varies more than 1%. Since I haven't lost any fat, that is ok. Tough to tell if it's accurate since the only comparison is to 3 point calipers and they aren't that accurate either. I like it.Tom"
5,Great item,Works like a charm every time. Very easy to use and relatively accurate for body fat %. I am a health and fitness manager at a top gym in london as well as an experienced personal trainer and I would recommend this item.
4,Seems good so far,"I just got it and have only used it a couple of times, but it is really easy to use."
1,Inaccurate and Pointless,"Tried one of these out at a health fair. The guy said it has a 4-5% margin of error...that is a lot IMO. There are a lot of factors (e.g. recent eating activity, recent exercise, skin temperature, air temperature, hydration level) that can impede the electric currents of these kinds of devices, so I wouldn't be surprised if the margin of error were even larger. But that didn't even matter because it wouldn't give me a measurement, it kept giving me an error. The guy said it usually occurs if you are too lean. So apparently it only works if you are w/in a certain body fat % range, and even then it's essentially just giving you a 10% range.You are better off getting a caliper (cheaper and 1% margin of error)."
2,Fat Loss monitor,This fat loss monitor does not work for me. I am muscular and very athletic and it is not acurate. I had to go back to using calipers.
1,Impossibly Low Results,"This tool consistently said I was at 6% body fat in normal mode and 8% body fat in athlete. I used it correctly each time, following the directions, multiple times through out the day, which only resulted in slight variations. While my upper body might be around those numbers, I still have enough flab around the lowest part of my abdomen that there is no way I am at 8% body fat. This thing works by sending electrical pulses through your body to measure resistance, and in turn, fat. I'm no rocket scientist, but electricity will take the path of least resistance, holding this would lead me to believe it is really just figuring out the amount of fat present in your upper body.I think I will be trying Omron's Full Body Sensor Body Fat and Body Composition Monitor instead, since you stand on it and hold a bar.. Hopefully that will mean the electrical pulses will travel my whole body, and result in an accurate reading."
2,Good conversation piece,"I had a professional company perform a body analysis with their big advance machine which was based on similar technology and they reported 15% body fat. The company was hired to come in at the office to perform the analysis on employees who were interested in monitoring their well being.At no time during the day can I get this machine to measure my body fat as over 8%. Sometime during the day it shows my body fat as low as 5%. I have to say this machine is a joke or the company was a scam! The difference between 5 and 15% just makes all the data useless.However, I have to say it is a good conversation piece among friends and family. An extra star for that!"
1,Worse than useless,"This body fat monitor is completely unreliable, which makes it worse than useless. On a few occasions I've used it twice in a row to check its reliability, and it routinely gives me two completely different readings (1% or more different), even though absolutely nothing had changed in the 20 seconds between readings. Imagine how different the readings will be over the course of a few days or weeks, purely due to measurement error. The estimate is also 4% different than the reading I got from a professional using calipers, despite my following the instructions accurately. I'm not sure what product you should use to measure your body fat changes, but it definitely shouldn't be this one."
4,better than calipers,This is a great tool for measuring body fat! Better than using a scale or calipers because you can actually see your numbers going down even though the scale does not.
5,fat loss monitor,"this works really well, so long as you always use it on an empty stomach and always weigh yourself first. its doing alot of math in there and if your weight is too high or too low this thing will give you the wrong body fat percentage.if you give it the right weight and you use this before breakfast every day it will be very consistent. I found it very easy to use as well."
1,fat loss monitoring in a parallel universe,"It's a crap shoot, feeding numbers in and getting them out of this little gizmo. Even the facts, like gender, age, height and weight, become variables. I feed in the numbers and the software, or whatever the Omron HBF - 306C Fat Loss Monitor thinks with, produces readings contrary to any realistic expectations that I, a fit, active 70+ guy, might have.So I experiment with the input, and the output changes, sort of. I suspect the software has built in expectations.That said, the thing appears to be true to itself; once the input is set, the readings are consistent, a little up, a little down from day to day. Gibberish, but consistent."
1,ehhh,"I do not like this product i put my weight (180) in and scanned then did the same thing saying i was lighter (165). After doing so my body fat dropped, i would believe that it would rise if this product worked right."
4,"fun to use, but accuracy is questionable","I'm not sure this product is very accurate. It gives me a different reading depending on how much I tell it that I weigh. Also, I can get several different readings within a few minutes or just by standing with my feet closer together."
1,Hate to burst everyone's bubble,"Electricity ALWAYS takes the quickest path to travel in one way and out the other. For instance, when you grip this machine with both hands an electrical impulse is sent through one hand, travels through your chest, and then exits from your other hand. The electric signal sent into your body is not making sure it passes through your legs, up to your head, and back down through your other arm."
1,"Omron HBF-306C Fat Loss Monitor, Black","Worst product I've ever purchased on Amazon.By all other measures including that of my doctor, my percentage of body fat is at least 7% lower than that registered by the Omron. It now sits in a drawer. As for the BMI function, any common BMI computing chart or program, easily obtainable on the internet, will give the same result shown by the Omron -it's a simple math ratio between a few factors not needing a hand-held 'device'."
2,More of a gimmic,"We purchased one of these because we saw it on the ""Doctors"" TV show, however the BMI calc can be easily done using any online chart. The other reading ""fat"" is varible. Pass on this one."
1,Cheap Electronics,Worked great for about a year. Would not work after replacing batteries. Tried several batteries that worked in other devices.
2,I had to input my information every single time,"I expected it to save my gender, age, etc. but instead I had to input the data each time I wanted to use it. I'm usually in a hurry in the gym so it has just sat in my locker not doing anything. I'll probably donate it to Goodwill. There might be a way to save information, but if so I didn't find it."
4,Monitor works well.,Follow the directions each time you use the monitor and you will get accurate results. A good product.
1,Not as accurate as I had hoped,"I also ordered the Accumeasure Fitness 3000 Personal Body Fat Tester, and I already own a scale by Tanita that measures body fat. I wanted to see if this Fat Loss Monitor was accurate. Unfortunately, in my experience with this item, it was not accurate. The calipers and the scale I already owned came up with the same result, and this monitor showed a result of 10 % lower. That is a big difference, and I decided to return the item."
1,Dont buy get a skin fold test instead,I purchased this hoping it would give me an accurate measurment. Ive had it for 3 months and my body fat hasnt changed says this mahcine. I got a skin fold done by a certified professional body builder / personal trainer and my body fat was 17% The machine says I am a 25%. I got 3 differnt skinfold test done by 3 differnt people and they all came back 17%. This machine was a waste of money in my opinion. If you want the truth get someone who knows how to take a skin fold test to do measure you. This machine is not accurate
2,don't like it because it tells me how fat i am,"i'm just kidding with the title of this review. the product is okay but just okay. it seems to be able to tell that my roommate is in better shape than i am but if you turn it off and on, you will get different numbers every time so it's not very accurate. i wanted to get it to keep track of the progress i am making at the gym, but it's inaccuracy makes this useless for monitoring progress. just gotta go back to using how i feel as the indicator."
4,great product to measure your ACTUAL weight loss,"this product is great if you want to find out how much body fat you have. Very useful especially when you start working on your muscles and get frustrated because your scale shows you gained weight (you make yourself feel better & become motivated by making sure your fat percentage is dropping - the weight you gain is pure muscle).I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 because somehow the product description made me believe that you can keep track of body fat percentage, that the device will have it stored in its memory. Instead it only memorizes your weight, height, age and gender (obviously whenever you lose a pound you need to go back and update the info). In overall it works great, I m satisfied with the purchase & shipping."
4,Does the job!,"I use this fairly often as an extra aid in my diet and exercise routines. I can only guess that it is accurate, but it seems consistent enough to get use out of.You can save users within it so you don't have to enter all of your info (height, age) every time you use it. It is also very quick with it's readings. Much quicker then some I've used in the past.For the price, I'd definitely say this is a good product that gets the job done and can be used to help you as you diet."
3,Good buy,This is a good buy for the price. Easy to use. Not sure how accurate it is since I have not compared it. The fat % has a fluctuation of +/- 1 percentage point but I think that is acceptable.
4,good item - satisfied,Be aware that this product uses Bioelectrical Impedance Method which in itself has few limitations and is not the most accurate method.I am happy with this item.- the reading are fairly consistent- very easy to setup/modify profiles and regular use- has athletic mode setting- shows BMI as well- aesthetically nicewould recommend.
5,Omron Body fat analyzer,"Use this for my personal training clients.Very easy, just follow directions.Great to document starting point and set goals."
3,Good as expected,"I bought this product knowing it was not going to be too accurate. For the most accurate results I followed the instructions; tested typically right when I woke up or right before I went to bed. However the problem with this product is that its accuracy is VERY poor once you are under 15% bodyfat. The readings I have gotten have been anywhere from 3 to 5 percent apart from each other, despite testing at the same time, under the same condition. It is an OK product to check progress, but don't purchase it thinking the results are end all accurate, they just aren't. I suggest you get the old fashioned caliper test done by your doctor or personal trainer for a more accurate results and then compare to the results from this machine."
4,Talk About an Inspiration!,"I purchased the Omron Fatloss Monitor to get a more complete picture of my health than I could get via the scale alone. Talk about inspiration!! The initial numbers just about put me in shock....Let's just say they were a far cry from those on the image here....but they totally motivated me to kick it up a notch (or seven!) and I'm pleased to report that they are improving. The only thing keeping me from rating this with 5 stars is that while there is information re: BMI numbers and where they fall in the normal to not-so-normal ranges, there is NO information re: normal fat percentages. This information would greatly enhance what can be understood from the readings."
3,Thought I would like this product,"I bought one of these because most of the reviews showed them as being more accurate than the ones that come on scales. maybe....since i am losing quite a bit of weight, i check this the first thing in the morning, and the last thing at night. not only can it deviate a bit using it back to back, but it can change as much as 2% from morning to eve, and visa versa. that is not my idea of an accurate device.even when i just compare mornings to morning, there is way too much variance.other than that, the product is well thought out and easy to use. better than nothing, since body fat percentage is as important, if not more so, than what the scale says. just wish it was a bit more consistent."
2,Too much fluctuation,"They use this at my gym and I thought for the price, I'd get it to have at home to monitor fat loss instead of just the number on the scale.I tried a few times (testing one after another until I got two of the same readings) and didn't change any settings and the fat percent varied up to 1.5% different each time and never got the same reading twice (after trying about 4-5 times). For $28.00, I would want something that doesn't vary that much.I'm sending it back and will just use my tape measure and the scale to monitor myself."
5,awesome fun & fitness ...,what a great item ... comes with the batteries ... easy to use ... based on research i have done it is an excellent alternative to height/weight/measurement charts ... more accurate for sure ... highly recommend
2,Needs Work,"The product has potential, but if your over 299 Lbs, forget it. This product does not work beyond that weight. Its very unfortunate. Furthermore, it appears to have a calculation discrepancy in the range of 2 - 5% in comparison to other methods."
3,Is it reliable?,"The device seems reasonably consistent. I tracked my results for a couple of days at variable times with presumably varying hydration levels and am always between 11-14% BF. Not exactly what I'd hoped for in terms of repeatability. By using my bathroom scales I consistently get 16.5-18% which is a number I have more faith in.It is simple to use and you do have to learn how to get more consistent results but even after that I find too much variability in my readings. My wife gets a similar range, 7.5-12%."
2,not working for me,"For me it did not work. With both settings the number was around 9 and I am nt around 9% ( I would like to be!).But with my girlfriend was saying a more true 25%. I feel if you have skin problem, or dry skin, don't take the risk."
4,decent product,Seems to be fairly accurate. Trainers I've worked with use the same one and rely on it.it's simple to use and to set up.
3,"Better than scales, but not great","I bought this because my BF% estimator on my scales didn't seem to be very accurate. These don't seem to be very accurate either, but I do think that they are better than the scales. They have kept pace better as I've lost weight, so I think this works slightly better at lower BF%, though still only a rough estimation."
4,Appreciative of other reviews,"I read through some of the other reviews posted prior to purchasing this product and found them very helpful. Since receiving this product, I've used it every morning and am tracking fat percentage and BMI. It appears to be functioning properly; however, I have no other data to compare. I am basing my conclusion on the fact that the percentages have been changing as I expect. I like having something other than just the weight on the scales to go by when trying to determine the worthfulness of my workouts. I have found the product easy to use."
4,Great lightweight shoe,"As mentioned in another review, it's about 1/2 to 1 size small so order a size up. It's a really nice shoe. Lightweight, decent cushion in the heel and forefoot and the breathable upper keeps my feet cool. This replaced a pair of Asics I wore out and i have to say I like these more. The break in period has been going very well and looks to be pretty short. Overall, a great shoe that's even better if you can find it on sale."
3,good music,bought cd for friends celebrating 50th wedding anniversary and they loved it and said it reminded them of their wonderful day
1,Don't Buy It,"It crashes a lot. It breaks a lot. Replacement parts are way too expensive. Megatech needs to offer a bag of 100 props for ten bucks and replacement wings for a few bucks each. If they don't, the plane is a worthless toy for most boys because...it crashes a lot...it breaks a lot."
2,Rip off,"After listening to this cd for about 30 seconds i realized that the songs sounded odd......then, I read the review by 'Jon' on Amazon. That was a mistake. The CD loses a lot of oomph when not just the singer but the MUSIC is altered. Anyone who listened to these songs ad nauseum 20 years ago can detect the difference. This is pretty bad.....I mix music ( the real songs) better than this guy/group. And, what's more - nowhere on the disc or in the accompanying wrapping/liner notes/etc. does it say ""musically and vocally altered versions of the original"". Total waste."
2,clincal,"this book is written by an army historian for other army historians and soldiers. it is written as an autopsy: sober, dry, plainly and painfully full of details, details, details. In short, I found it a great story told in a most boring way. zzzzzz it took me a looong time to plow through.If you want to see how a battle analysis is done well, this is your book. If you want to read what it's like to go through combat - look else where."
4,Very informative,Learn about some of the hero's of Tarawa and how Brave they were. This book starts at the planning of the attack to the End.A good read.
4,An unforgettable book!,"I prefer war novels like ""The Triumph and the Glory"" to histories because fiction is capable of delivering such profound emotional effects on a reader. But the great history books, like ""Utmost Savagery: The Three Days of Tarawa"" are so powerful that they transcend genre or category and proclaim the truth of our past in a truly unforgettable manner. This is one of the best books about men in battle I've ever read."
4,A great start!,"This is a wonderful CD, and we listen to it all the time. I never thought Beethoven Piano could be so good!"
4,Better than expected,"Originally a German production from a few years back, the awful, wooden English voice-dubbing just adds to the delightfully broad silly feel, and I thoroughly enjoyed the German heavy metal soundtrack. A fun, fairly well thought-out storyline, borrowing heavily from John Hughes and Sam Raimi, with likeable lead characters; ""Night of the Living Dorks"" is better drawn and acted than Hughes' ""Weird Science"" or many more-recent teenage horror flicks that attempt to copy Raimi's successful ""Evil Dead"" formula. The scares are played for laughs, and often quite successfully. The teen sex-farce elements are fairly innocuous and low-key, and fit logically into the story. I found myself liking this; it was certainly better than I expected."
3,Foreign-voice dub,"2.5 starz-voice dubbing was adequate, NOT even close to Shawn of the Dead, but if you like Zombie satire-deffinately worth a watch n decent budget-suggest rent before you buy-"
2,night of the living whales pen...?,"I just couldn't get into this, the badly done overdubbed voices just killed the feeling for this attempt at 3 kids who become zombies to score with chicks.If you understand French, or German or whatever this movie is, you might be able to hear how it was originally done, but the over dubb actors make it as bad as trying to watch a badly dubbed kung fu flick."
1,Plagarism,"I'm guessing the only reason the team behind ""My Boyfriend's Back"" doesn't sue the pants off this team is because the German plagarism laws are lax.Check that movie out, and be sure to look for a cameo by a young Phillip Seymour Hoffman!"
2,Description,"Wonderful, easy transformation for a tub to shower situation BUT the description needs to mention that this will only fit with a TWO KNOB water faucet (bar goes between the handles above) and not a one knob faucet. Of course, this is what we had and Ii will have to continue to look for one specific- or, remodel the wall for two faucets, which we may as well spend the extra for the shower piping."
3,Not the best but...,"It had very dark tones which I liked, but some of the music was very repetitive. Still, pretty good."
2,Reached Bottom...,"I have all of their records. The production is inconsistent, muddy, amateur, and awful on this record like it was made in 10 different places by 10 different bands/producers. I've always liked Fu's covers (especially Devo's ""Freedom of Choice"") and I think ""Moving in Stereo"" is the only song I listen to off this anymore. That's right, their original stuff here is all flat to me and unlistenable.For reference: I think King of The Road is my favorite album of theirs, it runs front to back with a coherent kind of theme and is a great road trip album for me. I feel Start the Machine was great in a new way, but this album has nothing. I'm glad I bought it to support them, but I wouldn't do it again."
1,WAS A FAN--------now they are junk,"Well they flat out suck now. The heaviness is gone. Cheap attempt at airplay or more MTV time. They look like American Eagle posterboys. If you were a fan that saw a continual downward trend and thought the last disc was crap. At least you can now say, ""I like some of their old stuff"". This is weak, non-stoner, pop metal. THE BUSHMAN"
2,Boring,"""Knew it all along"" is probably the only interesting song in the whole album. Same stuff as Start the machine. California Crossing is still the best Fu album. Why are they so afraid to try something new? Stoner rock ended up being like punk and hardcore: repetition after repetition after repetition."
2,durable it is not,"I received this toy after a month waiting due to back order. We were SOOO excited. When I unpacked the box, the Y splitter was broken - we weren't going to be stopped. I got one out of the garage and hooked it up. After the first go down the small slide (by my 50 lb daughter), a small hole openened up. Not to be daunted, we figured we'd keep playing until the kids were tired, then call the company. Unfortunately, the small hole led into a complete seam tear on the lower slide subsequently deflating the entire thing. SOOOO, for $500 and a month wait, my kids enjoyed exactly 1 hour of fun. The box says you can't return it to the seller, and need to contact the company directly. After 30 minutes on hold waiting for an operator at aqualeisure, I called the retailer from which I bought the lemon, and they agreed to allow me to return it to them. My thought is $500 is a lot of money for such a poorly made product."
2,Poor Durability and Customer Service,"This slide was great fun while it lasted. After about 5 uses a seam tore rendering it useless. Since the box said do not return it to the place you bought it,(Leaps and Bounds)I called the manufacturer.I was on hold for 50 minutes and then got a busy signal which changed into a recording that said they closed at 5:30.(It was about 5:20) I called Leaps and Bounds and they refunded my money no problem because it was out of stock.(Luckily)I thought it was probably an isolated incident til I read the review above."
5,Red Dawn at Lexington,The author presents rich insights to events and characters on both sides involved in our nations struggle for independence. The amont of research the author has done is tremendous and it seems that much of the information is newly discovered. The book is full of history yet reads very well.I had not realized before reading this book how many of our nations early heros had developed their military background and leadership ability through their experiences in the French and Indian Wars and how the military leaders on both sides had developed respect for the other because of those shared battles.I think every American History teacher should own and read this marvelous book to supplement what is available in traditional texts.
2,Each New Sunrise : Meditations in Maturity,"Margaret Alderman did a good job on phrasing her book. However, because of the number of pages, she did not fully develop her idea. Information is inadequate. It would be better for you to treatit as a leisure-killer rather than an info source."
1,not worth it,"Anybody who need to use the examples in this book will find that maybe only the example on P30 works. The rest is up to the uncertainty of the author as on P5, to which distribution of GTK+ would actually work with his examples and which of the compilers available might ""maybe"" work. Not worth it for anybody looking for a rigid text or tutorial. My personal view -- a complete waste of money."
4,Good book for a fresh start.,"After reading the first several chapters of this book and looking at some of the example programs I was able to write a very nifty GUI on a Windows NT workstation. This book contains some valuable information about GTK+ that is not available in the GTK+ Tutorial. In addition, a chapter is dedicated to GDK which I found to be a good introduction to GDK - the drawing kit. There's not a lot of documentation on GDK. This certainly helps. This book also contains several ""complete"" examples programs which shows several key figures of the GTK+ widgets. Of course, there's some typo's and misprints."
3,Textbook for the life,"When I was thinking about this book, I also found a book-review which said 'there is not enough reference or explaination!', but I completely agreed to that idea. Furthermore there are incomplete sample-code and a lot of mistakes. If you expect this book as recent HOW-TO book with CD-ROM, you will give up soon. If you read this book with the reference at gtk.org and look forward finding errors there, you will get good progress. Let's say this is not Gtk+ textbook, but 'textbook for the life.'Thanks."
3,"Better than nothing, but...","This book just isn't very complete. If someone totally new to gtk were to use this book from which to learn, they'd have problems right off the bat - some _very_ significant typos (like the compiler arguments on p.29) and total lack of documentation in several places (see others' comments). Luckily, I already knew a bit of GTK+ and could work around the errors, although the 'missing' documentation bugs me. Some of Mr. Harlow's code is really weird, too - strange pointer conversion creates a compiler warning (p.53), along with some other examples I don't feel like finding. It is a decent book for my purposes - it's like learning from the source, but with a little more documentation. If you know your way around GUIs and have money to spend, go for it."
3,Reasonable first attempt.,"A reasonable first attempt at documenting the GTK toolkit, hopefully as GTK becomes more popular it will have competition.My most serious problem with the book is the large amount of examples---just flicking through it seems to show every page with example code. Examples should not be used as a way of documenting an API, they should be used to _carefully_ illistrate selected points. And we don't need whole applications in the main text (they should be in an appendix).Compare for example the definitive Motif programming books, O'Reilly 6/6A and Doug Young's ""Programming and Applications with Xt/Motif"", both have much more discussion about the fundimentals of the API, and they didn't pretend to document the lower levels (Xt/X11) like this book does with Glib/GDK.Will I use it ? Yes. Will it become my defacto GTK document ? No. Do I wish it had more substance ? Yes."
3,"Not bad, but missing important concepts","If you are looking for a top-level guide to the most basic GTK+ functions, this might work for you. If you are looking for detailed explanations of components, an understanding of the inner workings of GTK+, or any information on graphics go elsewhere. The author skipped over graphics contexts (GC) completely; given the nature of the library, this amazes me."
1,I feel disappointed!,"I don't know what's wrong with my order, but I'm completely disappointed!First, I searched for the 6th Edition of Understanding Research Methods.It came out with a bunch of list, and so I picked this (the cheapest).The book came to my door 3 weeks 4 days after I ordered, and the one that came was the 5th Edition!The point is:I couldn't use the book, and I don't know how to refund. I've emailed the seller last week, but no reply at all!!!"
4,A victory against enormous odds!,"I was drawn to this book because my closest friend was diagnosed with esophageal cancer at age 52 in fall 1998 and was offered only palliative care initially until she appealed to be removed from her HMO. She was then treated at Georgetown but even after aggressive treatment she died in January 2000. Ms. French's book profoundly captures the essence of these devastating diseases and the roller-coaster ride for patients and their families. She ultimately proclaims a victory, not out of hubris, but instead with a new perspective on life. Outstanding!"
4,Quite a nice approach,"I found this book to be quite helpful. It is a nice compliment to either Thurston's or Ratcliffe's book. Results are generally proved in a somewhat more restricted setting than in Thurston (making results like Margulis lemma easier to understand on first meeting). The proofs in Ratcliffe seem very dry in comparison with the present work (the authors here tend to be more geometric in their arguments). As a matter of fact, I would put this book somewhere about the midpoint of the geometric intuition spectrum between Ratcliffe and Thurston."
2,Good advice for the student.,"More drawings should have been included, the rest of the book was clearly worked out. It is also suitable for new competitors in Noneuclidean Geometry. Only minus the few drawings."
4,"Billboard R&B Christmas A Keeper, But Bring Back Lou Rawls!","Outstanding collection of early rhythm and blues Christmas songs is docked one star for Lou Rawls' missing ""The Little Drummer Boy,"" a huge jazz/soul reworking from his out-of-print 1967 Christmas album ""Ho, Ho, Ho.""The rest is delightful, however, with classic reworkings and originals featuring stylish jazz (Johnny Moore's now-standard ""Merry Christmas Baby,"" redone by everyone from Elvis Presley to Sheryl Crow), sentimental strings (Clyde Otis' delightful arrangement on Brook Benton's ""This Time Of The Year"") reverent hymns (Sister Rosetta Tharpe's ""Silent Night,"") and offbeat novelties (the Cadillacs' doo-wop reworking of ""Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer,"" Chuck Berry's overdone, generic ""Run, Run Rudolph."") It's another well-made Rhino collection for vintage R&B fans and those liking their Christmas music freshly done, and essential once Rawls' classic is restored (or that LP reissued)."
5,Master @ work,This is the brother who put them all to shame. Even today his work out ranks them all. This is gonna look so nice framed up.
1,I returned it.,I reutned the item because it does not have a USB connection. I should have seen it before ordering.
4,transformative power,"I have read this book years ago and find its wisdom still relevant. It shows personal power in progressive stages with the ultimate stage being the most healing and metaphysical.It has helped me understand the power dynamic in the organizations I have worked in and has given me a way to help chart my course in becoming a better employee/manager/employer.Even though it is easy to read, one shouldn't pigeonhole others into the various categories of personal power, but should use this book to help understand and spur spiritual growth in the organizational life of yourself and others."
2,"Academically weak, but an easy read","We read this book for a doctoral class and of the dozens of book we read, this was the weakest in terms of support for the author's conclusions. The content was interesting although somewhat naive and simplistic. I wish there were a world such as the one Hagberg describes."
2,Not a true RMS meter,"I was teaching a class for electricians and decided to do some research on a good simple meter to reccomend to the atendees. I have used Fluke meters for most of my career and have foud them to be of excelent design and construction. The description of this meter, it's size and features made it sound ideal.It was not until we were working on a transformer and checking the votages that I realized that this was an ""Averaging"" meter as opposed to a true RMS meter. The readings from this meter were off by up to 18 Volts when measuing a 208V service as compared to several other true RMS meters being used. A 18 Volt discrepancy at 208V is well outside the stated accuracy of 1.8%.I still believe that Fluke makes some of the best measuring and testing equipment in the world. I just think that they should make it clearer in their advertising that this is an Averaging meter and AC voltages read will be significantly different from the true voltage."
2,"2 1/2 stars. You know, just below average.","Interesting collection, but probably not worth the price. The Selecter's ""On My Radio"" is a classic and well worth having in any rudeboy's collection. The Specials' ""A message to You Rudy"" is an interesting rendtion, despite having its authenticity called into question by another reviewer. It too is worth having as it stands in stark comparison with Rancid's version of ""A Message to You Rudy"" on ""And Out Come the Wolves."" The Selecter's ""James Bond"" is pretty funny, particularly if you're a 007 fan. The Judge Dread works waffle between being annoying and pleasantly entertaining. But then again, these tracks' authenticity have also been called into question. The rest of the set seems to be filler, some tracks are very high quality filler, but filler all the same. Regardless of how the set was recorded and mastered, it is entertaining. It's not worth going out of your way for, but if the oportunety comes up to get it cheap - go for it.SDG"
5,Great Memories,What a great gift to bring back all the memories. There is a little bit of everything for anyone who likes Ska & Reggae.
5,excellent,"even with reading as much information as i could find on quality of oil filters all the expert reading material i have found claims there is no good scientific reason to buy a name brand filter vs a cheaper off brand. having said that, the oil life on my time between oil changes runs 500-1500 miles longer when i have used k&n oil filters. so, i do buy them and pay twice what i would pay at an auto parts store and will continue to do so until proven that they are more harmful. so if you want to spend the money, go for it, as far as science will tell you, it is a waste, and as far as i will tell you, it is not."
5,K&N Energy Oil Filter,Excellent product. Quality of build far exceeds other filters in this price range. I have noticed that the oil is neither as thick nor as dirty when it comes time to change the oil while using this filter.
2,Kindergarten,"Well, I bought this off the reviews and I will admit my almost 5 year old does enjoy going through the book, but it is partially because she gets to write in a book, which is usually a no-no. I certainly would not call this a stand alone educational book. I am a homeschooler and I have an 8 year old that I teach. So this comes in handy sometimes when we are doing a subject that is over my 5 year olds head. She can sit at the desk with us and be quiet as she draws in her book.I will say I do think it is over priced and that is my main reason for giving it a low rating. If the price were lower I would give it a 3 1/2 - 4 stars."
1,Rip-off,"I was shocked when this book arrived today. It was priced 16.24 and is so small with very few pages. I am returning it today, and have to pay return shipping costs of 3.99."
4,Good Prep for 4 - 6 Year Olds,"Kindergarten readiness isn't about age, it's about readiness to learn in a formal setting with a group of children and from an authority figure. Taking that into account, and reading together Let's Get Ready for Kindergarten!, you will set up your child for an enjoyable and successful experience. Remember, this book is recommended for ages 2 - 6, so don't expect a 2 - 3 y/o to know all this stuff, but for those on the cusp of Kindergarten, I highly recomend this comprehensive book. And be sure to read the Parent and caregiver tips on the back cover.Another helpful book for parents of young children, The Birth to Five Book: Confident Childrearing Right from the Start"
2,Some pretty unusual recipies here...,"I guess when you've written thousands of recipies things have to start getting kind of ""wierd.""The recipies might taste good for me, but I'm adventurous.... my husband would hardly even try anything in this book. It sounds like the flavors would also be too strong and unusual for my child also. Who wants mommy's ""Leeky Chicken Couscous?"" ""Chorizo-Cod potato stew?"" ...they'd think I was joking and go order a pizza :-p"
4,SB Italian quick meals,This offers many good ideas and I like the idea of encouraging a stocked pantry for city people. Also there is an emphasis on helping starting cooks organize their meals. Good book for a college students reaching out on their own. Encourages healthy habits and emphasis on flavor.
1,Too cute for the kitchen,"This book is all fluff and very little real information. The language is cloying and takes away from any recipe that I would consider making. Rachel shoud stick to TV where it's fun to watch her, and forget books unless she's writing kiddie books. I am an accomplished cook and was hoping to find some easy, quick recipes. Instead, I was annoyed by all the Cute Stuff."
1,Give it a rest,"How many more Rachel Ray books are we going to have to endure? MS Ray's fountain of talent is only so deep and frankly the well went dry a LONG time ago! You'd have more time to cook if you weren't so ""busy"" watching rachel Ray on Tv. And you would do well to spend your time actually learning to cook instead of RR's ingredient dumping recipes that teach you nothing and perpetuate the myth that modern people are too busy to cook."
2,Rachael Ray Express,"Rachael Ray's Express Lane Meals is geared toward young people with limited incomes, and limited pantry/refrigerator space. It's all about ease, with some emphasis on health.As usual, Ray's Express Lane meals isn't truth in advertising. She goes for expensive and hard-to-find ingredients. She also makes complicated and unpalatable combinations. Soup mix cookbooks are easier and more budget-friendly in comparison."
3,"Tv show yes, cook book NO","Like another review I read her, I really like Rachel Ray but the cookbook I can live without. First of all, the meals take over 30 minutes(which would be fine, if this wasn't touted as 30 minute meals), secondly I don't like to spend money on one ingredient I will only use once because to be honest the recipes were not all that great. But maybe I'll give it try again and break it out as it's been a few years since I used it!"
3,"Love Rachel, Her Cookbooks -- Not So Much",I think Rachel is much more entertaining to watch than she is a cookbook author. I think other Food Network hosts have better books -- Ina Garten (Barefoot Contessa) and Giada DeLaurentis (Everyday Italian) are much better.
3,"Pretty good, but takes me longer then 30 minutes","I have tried 7 recipes so far out of this book, it is nice because a lot of the ingredients are easy to find for me, like EVOO and garlic. Some though were a little hard for me to find and I had to ask my Mother in law were to find them. 6 of the meals I made out of the 7 were a hit, but they all took over 30 minutes to prep and prepare. This is a good book if you do not mind having to look for occasional ingredients that you are not use too, and also if you have about 45 minutes to prepare and cook- with no interruptions. I should add that I have a baby in the home, so for me it takes an hour!"
2,Never use it,"I never use this cookbook. The recipes aren't appealing to me at all unfortunately, so I'm donating my copy to someone else. I'm picky with my food, but literally not one recipe appealed to me. Oh well!"
3,Not realistic for an average budget!,"I wanted to like this book because I like to cook fast meals. However the items she suggests to keep on hand are expensive and in Idaho difficult to find. Some of her recipes call for expensive produce and spices and turn the meal more into a 10-15 dollar deal--in which case I would rather eat out and have someone else do my dishes. Some of the recipes call for expensive fish, cheese, or other condiments that most people don't use or eat.Not realistic for an average budget or for how the average American eats and cooks."
2,dissapointed,"I was quite anxious to get the book and start cooking, but when I received the book I was very dissapointed with the book itself. It is not inviting in any sense. I just can not believe that there are only handful of pictures of the respices in the book. I guess it is just more important to get, I don't know, several books out in one year rather than doing one professionally. Cooking is something of a special field of ""science"" and a well made cookbook with appropriate pictures will not only give one that preliminary ""taste"" of the recipe but the visual connections makes your mouth water. Afterall, a picture can describe thousand words.The recipes provided are nothing spectacular either. I was expecting much more. Too many burgers for one thing."
1,Save your money!,"Don't waste your money on this cookbook, if you can even call it that. I should've learned my lesson from her last book. The woman cannot cook. Most of the recipes in this book are awful. I was looking for some ""healthful"" recipes, but somehow frying bacon in extra virgin olive oil doesn't fit into that category!!!!Spend your money on Paula Deen's new magazine!!! There are a ton of delicious recipes there!!!Ms. Rachael Ray, I do belive your 15 minutes are up!!!"
1,here is the beef,"I expected a more balanced array of recipes. In this day and age with so many of us trying to eat healthier foods, why not have some vegetarian recipes? How about more seafood recipes? I think Ms. Ray needs to get into the 21rst Century. I did not expect a vegetarian cookbook, but how about some options for the flexitarians? We eat seafood and lots of veggies, maybe sometimes a little poultry. Please forget the red meat!"
1,bad bad,"this is is a horrible cook book. I didn't buy it at amazon, but it was awful. Not imaginative at all."
2,one that loves the food network,"now i love rachael ray. i have several of her cookbooks i even own her video ( which you can find at target ) but i was'nt so crazy about this cook book.i found a few recipies i would like to try, like the drunken pasta and the cowboy spaghetti ( although i would leave out the evoo with the bacon..... i can feel my cholesterol go up as i write this. )i would love to see rachael write a cookbook for living a more healthy lifestyle( if any one could add taste in this kind of food she could :)and of course like the others i would love to see more pictures, i love to know what the food is suppose to look like when its done.I work at a book store and the customers say the same thing, so sometimes they opt to buy another cookbook. ms. rays other cookbooks have been a wonderful addition to my collection, but i'm sorry to say i'll be bringing this one back."
3,On hand supplies,"I was a bit disappointed as a large part of the recipes are from things that you need to have ""on hand"" such as capers, canned chick peas, shallots, spanish onions, Italian Tuna in EVOO and anchovy fillets. I think there were over 50 items listed that you needed to have on hand. Some were simple, such as peanut butter, but most were not. There were certainly many items I don't keep on hand, that would send me to the long line at the supermarket, rather than the express line. Which sort of defeats the purpose, doesn't it?I would have also appreciated the calorie count, the sugar count, dietary items.Although I do love to watch her on television, I was just hoping for some of her great recipes truly through the express line at the grocery store."
2,"Too many ""special items""","I thought this book could make my meal planning easier, but there are way to many non-standard ingredients in most of the recipes. Only cooked one dish, which was good, but I don't find this practical."
3,A little too much Italian,"I checked this out at the library and I'm glad I did. Overall, the meals she included sound pretty good but there is just way too many Italian recipes. I like Italian as much as the next guy but she needs to replace some of those with other types of food. The meals in this cookbook are quick and easy and I found I have most of the ingredients on hand so I didn't have to run out and buy a bunch of things for 1 recipe. I would have liked to see her use other spices that just salt and pepper, sometimes it felt a little bland. Overall it's a fine cookbook for novice cooks and those who have little time to prepare meals."
4,"Not bad, not great but good pantry meals","It appears most reviewers either love this cookbook or hate it. I'm firmly in the middle. I bought this book because this is a pantry-meal cookbook. No exceptional ingredients (in my opinion), doesn't take more than 30 mins (I did the Leek-y Chicken in 7 mins.) and the recipes are easy to manipulate if you want to go in another direction.So, its a pantry-meal cookbook. Its a great place to turn when you're looking for something basic, easy and in your pantry already. I haven't loved the recipes yet--they are actually somewhat bland. But I've done them by the book, so to speak.I didn't by her book for fine cuisine. I bought it to give me some fresh ideas when I'm feeling brain dead after a long day--and REALLY don't want to make rice and beans again or mac and cheese. I consider these recipes to be a great starting point from which I can add my own touches. The recipes that I've read, but not made, all seem solid and workable."
3,"Good food, but...","I love the recipies in this book. They all sound so good and they work out very well.But, there is no way these are 30 minute meals. I suppose if I had everything already preped and ready to cook, that would be true, but to suggest that these are simple and quick to prepare and cook is just misleading. And the portions are way out of wack for how many people thay are supposed to feed. I did the french bread pizza for four, and had enough to feed ten (if I had had enough bread).Still, the food is good and well thought out. I will continue to use this book for at least one meal a week, if just to make something new for my family. But I will not believe the claims of how quick and easy it is to make."
4,"A Beautiful, Informational Text - If somewhat 'fluffy'...","This book was part of my massage school curriculum. I tried to really get into it like my teachers, but I had a hard time with the 'fluffy' stuff weaved in and out of this book.However - the theories and ideas presented are WONDERFUL. The book itself is written in a very thoughtful manner, and I can appreciate that. As a massage therapist, I can appreciate this volume.While I wouldn't say this is a must read, I think if you have the time, give it a go."
5,Job's Body: A Handbook for Bodywork,"A bit on the technical side for other than those familiar within the medical field, but would strongly advise reading Job's Body for insight and learning about one's own self. A learning experience definately."
5,Perfection!,"Absolutely the best bodywork book I've ever read, bar none. I read the first edition of this book about 15 years ago, and it was a big eye-opener for me; I saw the body in a whole new light, it gave me things to think about and apply for years. I wish Deane Juhan would write a lot more books."
5,Jum Reeves,I have never had a bad Jim Reeves albumn and this is no exception. His music is so relaxing to listen to.
4,Jack Smith's LA,"For so many, Los Angeles is the place with lots to do, but so many freeways, it is hard to know where to go. This book, by Jack Smith, a writer for several newspapers in Los Angeles from 1940's through the 1980's will bring light to a simpler and fascinating time period of Los Angeles history. Mr. Smith had the greatest job...find something interesting to write about, and then have it published in the local papers. He did it all without a I Phone and a computer."
4,Prophetic and Subtle,"As an interviewer, I was astonished at how much R.G. Powers reads like his novels; unapologetic and yet subtle, kind. I interviewed him because I wanted to know him, to know the man who exposed a century, and brought down ambivalence with a vengeance. ""A Wind Across the Century"" is a moving journey of the soul, ending in a new life--J.H. Hudson"
3,I saw this as a kid in 1976 and also as an adult in the 90's,"It from the era when Wonder Woman gave up her powers and lived as a mortal.The production values are very low(this being 1970's television),but the story is engaging and the plotting well done for the era.Wonder Woman is presented as in a very 1970's way that unlike early Lynda Carter episodes does not hit you over the head constantly with feminist platitudes but instead portrays women as compassionate yet capable.Gone here is the classic bustier,replaced with a blue zip-front tunic over red leggings,and a large gold belt with built-in grappling hook (bracelets do something too but cannot remeber what).Ricardo Montalban is the villan here,another amazon is helping him.This is far better than 65% of Lynda Carter series(which tended towards insipid pap),but is very different from the Wonder Woman most are familiar with.Keep an open mind and you may enjoy this!"
5,The Love Collection,Every song is wonderful. He has a soft touch when he plays the piano. It is absolutley what I expected and more.
3,Richard Clayderman CD,"I like Richard Clayderman's music very much. I don't really care for this CD. This is no one's fault but my own. Amazon.com gives a person the opportunity to listen to a little bit if each song before purchasing the CD. After I ordered and listened to it, I realized I didn't like very many of the songs. Like I said, this is my own doing. It will in no way keep from making future purchases from Amazon.com."
5,Great Stuff!!!,"What a great book. The perfect guide for anyone looking for that odd or out-of-the-mainstream rental when everyone else is lining up for that same old Top Twenty. Well-written, funny, informative. It's a terrific companion at the film store. Actually, I keep it in my car's glove box so it's always available."
4,I Can Show You The World!,"This is an essential for any movie geek or individual with an insatiable love for B,cult, and independant pictures.Along with these reviews, the hound also contains a tribute on each new letter of the alphabet to certain movie heroes and icons such Bela Lugosi, Quinten Tarantino, and many many more. The book also has an introduction by the King Of The B's, BRUCE CAMPELL!Highly recommended"
2,Various Artists - HA,"These 14 songs were performed by the group Sunset Singers. These are not ""various artists"". Only marginally good."

3,OK BOOK,"I PURCHASED THIS BOOK BECAUSE OTHERS MARKED IT AS 5 STAR , IN MY OPENIEN THIS BOOK IS FULL OF UNUSFULL INFO + REPEATED INFO.NOT TOO MANY PICS, DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT A/C SYSTEMS..ETC.I THINK THERE'S BETTER BOOKS FOR SAME SUBJECT."
5,know your karma (birth cycle),the book is a very good source of theoritical and mythological explanations of your own karma and birth cycles. This book also relates to the spiritual powers of a human with the birth times and life stars. A real good source for all the people of spiritual domain.
4,"A bit arcane, but very useful for artists and designers!","Hambidge writes about design principles found in nature which can be applied to the work of the artist and designer. Since the time of the ancient Egyptians, these compositional techniques have been used to give proportion, symmetry, and beauty to buildings, sculpture, paintings, etc. Because of their complexity and rigor, the principles are no longer taught widely, but they are useful for any artist or designer interested in making compositions which appeal to humans' unconscious sense of proportion. The book is old, and a little difficult to understand, but Dover has reproduced it well."
1,Big Disappointment,"Robson's Ride the Wind was one of my all-time favorite books so when this book was released I snatched it up. It was hard to get into but I was persistant and kept waiting for the book to meet my expectations. Unfortunately, there was no turning point. I just trudged through this book. Read the editorial review from Publisher's Weekly. It is right on, saying that the story is ""watered-down"" and ""lacking energy."" I hope this review spares someone from wasting their time and money on this book."
5,Native American Indians,"I've been very passionate about everything & anything that has to do with Native American Indians since I can remember.This book by Lucia St. Clair Robson is another wonderful story about them, about their life and about a great woman. I couldn't put the book down, I would stay up & read till 2am having to have to wake up at 5:30am and go to work... I gave it 5 stars only because it is the highest you can go. The book simply deserves more stars!"
4,Ghost Warrior,"I am a first time Ms.Robson reader and I enjoyed this book a great deal. I could not put it down. I highly recommend anyone looking for a good book to read this one. My only regret was the ending, I was hoping for Rafe to play more into it than he did."
2,Not what I expected,"This book was not my cup of tea for several reasons. First, I don't care for girlfriend books. Secondly, I don't want to read a book tagged Christian romance with profanity and drunkenness by the H/h, and finally, there was no romance. Where was the romance? This book was a great disappoinment to me."
5,not happy with the condition of the book -- excellent customer care service,"I was very unsatisfied with the condition the book arrived. I always look for books with no text markings and only buy those who specify it. The book has many color highlightings and notes on the margins, so I wrote back to Motor Cycle Books and they gave me a refund in less than 24 hours. Excellent customer service, really made a difference!"
4,Better than a band-aid.,"There is no doubt about it. New Skin stinks. It smells up the room when you use it and hours later you can still smell it. But it works. I often have small cuts and abrasions and since I'm a swimmer I try to avoid going to the pool when I've got an open cut. New skin fills the gap and keeps your scrape protected until it heals over. I like it better than a Band-Aid because a Band-Aid can trap moisture and leave your skin white and clammy underneath and takes a long time to heal.While I could wish this product had a better smell, I'm willing to deal with the stink because it works. 4 stars."
3,Like an artificial scab - works great for joints,"I had a scrape on my elbow that wasn't healing quite right - every time I moved my arm, the developing scab would crack and expose the wound. And it hurt every time! Regular bandages kept the area too moist, so I tried this stuff.It does sting a ton and it does have a strong smell like nail polish. But once it dries, it doesn't hurt and it's just like a real scab. I found I had a much greater range of painless movement, and the wound healed faster.Because of the stinging, I wouldn't use it if a bandaid would do. But for cuts in odd places where bandaids don't work well, it's pretty good. I might try a different brand of liquid bandage in the future, but I'll finish my bottle of this first."
2,does not breathe well,"recently used this product when my son fell and suffered a scrape on his forehead. i applied two coatings of the product to the wound and almost a weak later the wound has not formed a scab and appears to be quite raw yet. while the product is quite easy to use, i think the wound would have healed a lot faster if left open or covered with a simple bandaid. that said, if you plan to swim then it sure beats using a bandaid or leaving the wound open."
1,Worst Liquid Bandage Ever!,"This product stings a LOT, like dropping alcohol over an open wound! It also takes a long time to dry. Stay away from it!!! Nexcare liquid bandage works much better and just because it was not available at the store I tried new-skin. I had to throw new-skin straight to the trash can."
5,Great product for blisters,"I had two huge, gaping blisters on the heels of my feet from my new cleats, and I decided to try this product. It worked amazingly well. Whereas my blisters usually take 3-4 weeks to heal, this product had them healing within a week. It also was good to put the liquid bandage on the blister, then a protective band aid on top, when I was going to wear the shoes again. It does sting when you put it on, but only for about 10 seconds. Definitely recommend this product for blisters and small cuts."
3,"Works, but dries a lot slower than super-glue.","I bought a bottle of this stuff because people always tell me I'm crazy when I put normal cyanoacrylate glue (Yeah, superglue, crazy glue, you know the stuff) on cuts. I had heard that cyanoacrylate was used in the military during the Vietnam era on wounds, and knew from personal experience how superglue forms a hard layer very quickly on skin. And it does work very well, especially for small finger cuts where a band-aid interferes with movementHowever, apparently normal superglues produce methyl alcohol as they dry, which can kill tissue. So don't use it for wounds.This stuff is basically the same, but with a couple differences: it has an antiseptic, it's thicker, and it dries much, much slower. The first two, no big deal, but the last one makes me kinda wish I was still using normal super glue.(Please note that I am not advocating the use of crazy glue for wounds -- that is totally not FDA-approved. I just wish that this stuff dried faster.)"
5,Works on cracked fingertips,I get very bad cracked fingertips from the winter weather and this is the only stuff that helps those nasty painful things. Yes it smells but I don't think its that bad.
1,Don't go by the picture.,"I'll admit, I've never bought a pin set and hardly know what they're used for. If you know what you're looking for and go by the description of this product then you'll be ok. If you go the picture you'll be as disappointed as I was. The picture shows 171 pins when it actually comes with only 49. If I knew more about this product I may have been able to deduce that there were only 49 pins by calculating the measurements, however as stated I didn't. Main point, don't go by the picture that shows 171 pins. That is not what you'll get."
4,gift boxes,These were a little hard to figure out how to put together at first (and no included instructions or drawings) but I figured it out eventually. They are very nice quality though and would make excellent wedding favor or gift boxes for parties. Kind of small though.
5,best noodle,"these was easy to cook and was very goodto eat,i ate some with just ov and some we added shrimpsif you looking for great fettuccine try these,"
1,Please Lower The Price DOWN!,why do the sellers try to sell it because they're trying to rip you off.I am willing to get this when these sellers lower their prices of this guide !
3,I don't care for Strategy guides but...,"I'm the type of person that feels I game has to be experenced in it's true form... I beat Final fantasy 7 without a guide, I've gotten through about half of Resident evil,FF8,and I've just about beat Crash 2 without the guides but I do like having them for second go rounds... most give you tips,maps, and well disired secrets, with the Final Fantasy games they list much needed items list, world maps, and weapons. all and all I feel they have their good points, but someone shouldn't rely on them for walkthroughs because that's part of the fun in playing... long time gamer... Rat BOy"
5,It works wonders!,"Amazing product with no side effects!It has increase my positive mood.Lessened my anxiety.And kept me on track with healthy habits.I have real bad depression and before I would only focus on that.Now it seems I have more time on my hand and can do what I want.I only need to take two pills a day. One in the morning and one at night.A steady routine should be built. The effects aren't immediate. It takes affect in a week or two.Great product at an affordable price. Really, GNC has it for $19 and it only comes with 30 capsules."
3,Not as good as I expected,"I purchased this last month thinking it will be better than the brand I've been using for several months now (Doctor's Best), but to my disappointment it just didn't work with me the way I thought even after a month of using and after doubling the dose! I will definitely go back to my previous brand as it did make a real difference to my mood & sleep.I for one do not recommend it."
1,Not so good,First use of one capsule caused some drowsiness but the mild headache and nausea the next day made me decide to trash the rest. Waste of money considering the bad medical reports on this product and my own experience.
2,Wish I could sleep.,"Friends told me this product really helped them to sleep but I guess after 40 years of wakeful nights, I was hoping in vain for a miracle. I couldn't tell any difference when taking 2 of the capsules a day. It's been a month and still no help with sleeping."
1,Might As Well Be a Placebo,"Didn't do a damned thing. Didn't improve or regulate my sleep, mitigate any depression or my appetite. Not a damned thing. I wasn't expecting a miracle or for it to do everything the bottle says it *might* do, but I figure out of three, it would at least help one thing (sleep, mood, appetite)but nope. Nada. I was really looking for a natural, gentle, non-prescription aid (not necessarily a solution, just something to help)and thought I had found it. No such luck. Oh well.Bear in mind, different things work for different people so don't necessarily take my review as the gospel--it's just my honest experience."
2,Hmmm,Yeah Idk if this stuff actually does anything. Any my mom thought it was hard drugs because the pill is sketchy looking
3,good service,service from the company was great. but did not notice much change after taking them. may be it is more of a steady change?
3,Made my stomach queezy....,"I spent a morning ""tossing my cookies"" after trying this just one time. I stopped it immediately. I cannot testify as to whether it works but will tell you it made me nausous."
2,don't bother!!,"Product makes me slighly nauseous and VERY tired.. I guess not everyone will have the same affects but I read somewhere that Dr.Oz says this is a great appetite suppression... Not so much.. Not for me anyway. It has zero bearing on my appetite at all.. If I had wanted a sleeping pill, I would have went with another product :("
1,Just Not Impressed,"I took this product for about 6 weeks either 1X per day or 2X per day. I took it to help with my sleep issues and anxiety. What I found was that the longer I was on this, I started to feel on the verge of panic attacks and very jittery and on edge. I tried to figure out what I was doing that was different. This was one of the few things in the equation I was doing differently. I don't know if I had a seratonin overload or what, but this is not worth it."
3,Haven't quite taken it long enough to see results,"I have been taking 2 capsules daily for about 4 weeks. I have noticed that I do feel happier (before taking it I couldn't even feel joyful at all). I haven't taken it long enough to see the full effects though. I look forward to seeing if it helps with my anxiety the way it did for my brother.I started out with 1 capsule a day and 10 days later decided to take 2 a day because I didn't feel any different. 2 Capsules a day seems to be the right dose for me. If you try this, just make sure that you give it time. It needs time to change the way your brain produces the ""happy"" feelings."
4,Natural Sleep Aid,I have used this product for several months and found it to be helpful to inducing sleep. It is all natural and I have found no side effects whatsoever. I would recommend this product to anyone that wishes to use a non-prescriptive aid for sleep.
3,Kept me awake!,"I tried this product to help me get to sleep, but I found that it kept me up instead! I have had a lot of success with melatonin but I wanted to see if 5-HTP would work without any grogginess in the morning. By itself the 5-HTP did not help me get to sleep and when I took it in combination with the melatonin I got to sleep (thanks to the melatonin!) but woke up after only a few hours and could not get back to sleep. I have no idea whether this product helps with depression since I wasn't taking it for that so I'm giving it 3 stars. If you're thinking of trying this for sleep problems you might want to buy a small bottle first since it's effectiveness obviously varies from person to person."
2,Not the best choice when it comes to 5-htp,"I love 5-htp. It has changed my life. However, this is a poor product. I much prefer the ""purple lid"" product over this one. I think it has to do with the capsule dissolving to soon and the 5-htp being broken down in the stomach before any is absorbed into the body. This is just my opinion. I found that 5-htp helped my sleep cycle normalize.I have always had problems falling asleep. After taking 5-htp for a month, I found that I fell asleep when I was supposed to. I have not had any negative side effects. No crazy dreams as I read in other reviews. Overall if your looking for 5-htp supplements, look elsewhere."
2,Stomach problems,The side effects of this outweigh the benefits. Very hard on the stomach felt bad all day. But I could see it improving my mood but I wouldnt take this again. there are others minerals that are better without harsh side effects. Not sure if it was the brand or 5htp.
2,I don't feel any difference at all,"I don't thin this works for me. I have only taken it twice but the first time I took it I actually couldn't sleep at all. and next day I took it, it didn't do anything to me. so, i guess this doesn't actually do anything to me-don't know why."
3,this is an exodia structure deck,It would be silly to plan on getting this deck and using it as is. My son got it as a present a while back and it does make for a boring game where all you do is delay losing. But this christmas he got the 5 pieces of exodia and put those into this deck and it all makes sense. It delays the game and has cards to allow him to draw though his deck quicker. If your kid wants to build an exodia deck then this is probably a good starting point.
3,stalemate,"if this deck plays against another similar defense deck, it would be the most boring game in the world. as the name suggests, this deck is based heavily on defense; total defense shogun would be an excellent addition to this deck"
3,Make sure you buy the right batteries!,"Bought this at my local supermarket for the same price one can get it online and when I got home, plopped in my Rechargeable Ni-Mh Maha batteries only to find out that the combined voltage (2.4 vs. 3.0) was insufficient to operate the device. Took one rechargeable out and inserted the battery that came with the device and it works. Don't have a clue how long it'll last, though."
1,it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger!,It states works with motorola cell phone plugs but it didnt work on mine NOW IM STUCK WITH THE PLUG THAT DOSENT WORK
4,Raising a firstborn...,"... is fun and challenging! He fits the book to a ""T"".The only thing I don't like about the books is that on every page the cub is asking if mama cub loves them the most... so far that isn't an issue in our family. On the last page it does say that mama cub loves all her cubs, but gives specific reasons she love the first born. I hope this books doesnt make that a ""problem"" for us."
4,Pretty Good for Firstborns,"I love Kevin Leman and am a big fan of his stuff, so I was anxious to get these for my kids, now that I have 3. The books are written using generalizations about birth order, which is true more often than not. In these books the kids are two girls and then a boy, so it's the opposite of my household, but my oldest understood and went along with it. He seemed to really like the book and thought it was neat that they each have their own book now, but some of the info in it was a little off since it's based on generalizations. Overall, it's worth it to get to make your child feel special and like his place in the family has its unique qualities."
3,Too Stereoptyped,"I am a psychologist and bought all 3 books in the series when my son's wife gave birth to his 3rd child. I didn't preview it before I read these books to the oldest as well as to newly deemed ""middle child."" I was disapointed and a bit apologetic to their parents when we all read it together. These children knew the message(s) in the book were related to them. I felt that since they are so young, they were getting a message about how they were going to (or should) turn out. Also, there were references to Christmas and I felt this didn't leave room for people who celebrate other holidays than those. I thought the concept of the book was good. From the title, I was mainly interested in the message that the mother loves all three of her children, recognises differences, but loves them just the same. I wish the author would have just adhered to that theme and left the predictions about their personalities and behavior out of it.[...]"
1,Disappointed,"The book struck me as silly and it bored my 6-year old, who wouldn't sit through it. It is also overtly Christian, so if you don't want to send a message about Christian God, it's not appropriate. I returned it."
2,"Not everybody likes cheese, though...","Aw, I like cheese a little bit and cheesy movies even more, but this one's not really all that much fun and certainly not a five star film. It is certainly recommended for all you budding bad movie buffs (I would think most of the old BMB's have already seen and/or own this)and I do recommend that all of you out there should watch it at least once...but when the novelty value of John Carradine playing ""Dracula"", terrorizing Folger's Mrs. Olsen in what looks like a vintage 60's TV cheap western wears off, you'll have to stifle many yawns before the credits roll. As the saying goes, ""Caveat Emptor""!"
1,dracula walks in daylight,"This isn't a fun cheesy movie, it's boring. This is only a movie for a cure for insomnia. A real four a.m. in the morning movie. Watch at own risk."
4,Bringing understanding to the student.,"This texts offers a comprehensive guide to basic chemistry. Offering very clear explanations, as well as easy to comprehend examples for problem solving. Up to date and accurate, I would suggest this book to anyone who is in need of a refresher course in chemistry as well as a new-commer to science."
5,Exquisite!!!!!!!!,"I Love this CD. It is so different, gentle and transcendant. It is Deep yet sublimely simple. The accompanying music to her lovely vocals is also evocative and communicative of a wonderful cultural approach to life and music. Irina Mikhailova has a rare voice that conveys a depth of nuance and emotion that most vocalists don't come near. Original, unique and enchanting!I have over 1000 CD's. This remains in my top 10!I just want to hear more of Irina. Her latest CD ""Esquiesses"" is also very good but the musical accompaniment is too bold for my tastes."
3,not as much actual editing info as expected,"While I do recomend this book as a good insight into the politics of making a major motion picture, I found it lacking in the one area it should have exceled in-editing. As an editor myself I was looking for more insight to O'Steen's thought process and editiorial technique and less behind the scenes gossip. Skip all the chapters after ""Chinatown"". It is a good read up to that point."
1,Made me want to cry,"As I was reading this book, it really made me wonder where the great Republican leaders have gone to. I voted for Bush back in the day, but he just squandered our Republican power built up by Reagan. It seems now that Barbara is just going around and having a good time. I wish she would try and help her son get his act together instead of having tea parties."
2,Boycott This Book,"The inevitable comparison must be made to the last First Lady opus by Hillary Clinton. It must be said that Senator Clinton wins out in the honesty/self-scrutiny department. We get no sense of the great failures of the men in Mrs. Bush's life (Bush 41's kowtowing to the Religious Right, 43's AWOL period from the National Guard). In short, this is a self-congratulatory memoir by a narrow, arrogant, and not particularly nice woman who, shall we say displays characteristics of a word that ""rhymes with rich."""
3,"Love Barbara, Hate the Book","I love Barbara Bush, but this book is difficult to read. It is a diary that hasn't been fleshed out. It consists of numerous entries that state that she went somewhere, met someone, her husband went somewhere, met someone, etc. Only rarely do we get a glimpse of her personal life. I enjoyed her recounting the time her grandchildren pelted the Secret Service agents with water balloons. It made the family seem more human, but these little gems are tucked away in the book amid detail after boring detail.I am an avid reader. I pick a book up and rarely, put it down before I have read it in its entirety. Currently, I am stuck on page 281. I am going to have to force myself to finish it."
1,Do not read,Terrible writing - no human being can travel as much as she said she does - really did a bad job on Al Gore. Every mother thinks her son is the best but not to this degree in public. Paragraphs weren't finished on any one topic. Loved her lst book and really looked forward to reading this one. I am surprised that she didn't put in the amt. of money she made on each appearance. Really wouldn't recommend it to anyone.Elaine Barry
1,yawn,.....It is a good thing you came and woke me up I had fallen asleep reading this book. Check it out at the library and don't waste your money.
1,"""Shallow Reflections""","What a life! Golfing with the Annenbergs! Lunching with Cardinals! Lots of fancy dinners and ribbon cuttings! But none of these are new revelations, all have been published as news items or in society columns. Whereas Mrs. Bush's first book was introspective, candidly revealing a bout with depression, her rocky relationship with her mother, and the difficulties associated with frequent moves due to her husband's career, this book is no more than a calendar log of her travels and daily activities. The deepest comment? ""Wonderful"" used frequently to describe grandchildren and friends.If literacy is such an important cause to her, why doesn't she take her son to task for taking steps to end funding of Head Start programs? What about her feelings concerning her granddaughter Noelle's well publicized drug problems? Her son Neil's messy divorce? Perhaps the editors removed her more pithy observations, but I was greatly disapointed by this shallow and unsatisfying book."
1,Tedious and self-effacing,"If this woman were not an ex pres. wife this book would have remained in the ""do not consider"" pile on the floor of any publishing company. It is boring, poorly written and filled with ludicrous stories that are self-effacing. An embarrassment."
3,Not as good as her first book,"After reading Mrs. Bush's first memoir, her husband's second book, and finally this book, I did have a profound respect for her dignity, love for her family, and stamina. Reading between the lines, I did see an elitisism about which she is oblivious. It could be argued it was well earned elitisism. Also, although I respect her refusal to say anything hurtful or scandalous, some of the stories she sugar coated made me think she was either too involved to be objective or just plain trying to manipulate public opinion. The ""perfect family"" picture is warming to read, but if true, something few can relate to I think. Overall, I enjoyed her books (much more so the first one) but her effort to change opinions on gray issues did not change my mind one bit. The books did, however, make me admire the Bush's as a couple more, the love for their kids and each other, and their principles, even if I did not agree with all of the latter."
1,Boring Redundancies,"I thought this book would be interesting -- provide a different view of places Mrs. Bush has travelled and people she has met as a result of her husband's career. I was thinking of mentions of protocol in different countries, descriptions of life in different countries for high ranking politicians, etc. Instead, I read this book that seems simply silly to me...a list of countries visited with no interesting information about the countries or what happened while she was there, a very unsophisticated view of the few then current events about which there are comments, and loads of ""George and my kids are so wonderful and so are all of our million friends"" and lists of who slept at the Bush's. I am surprised someone who has been lucky enough to see what Mrs. Bush has seen could write such a boring book."
2,"Should have been called ""Barbara's Itinerary""","How terribly disappointed I was in this book, which could have been so interesting. Basically, Mrs. Bush simply is printing her journals, which consist of not much but a listing of everywhere she has traveled in the past few years, and everyone she has had lunch or dinner with --- hunderds of names, with no character development at all. In some ways it would be interesting to go back through this very lame excuse for a book and see how many times she used the term ""my dear friends"" prior to listing everyone with whom she dined.Her portrayal of her family has elevated all members to the level of sainthood. Obviously, they can do no wrong.Mrs. Bush had a wonderful opportunity to tell fascinating stories about people and places in her latest book. Unfortunately, all she has done is cough up her daily schedules interspersed with tidbits of actual writing."
5,Flat-out adorable,Every woman should have at least one pair of red shoes - and these are a perfect pick. Comfortable and stylish; well made and supportive. These flats are flat-out adorable.
5,Excellent for the price,"I actually loved the ahir. It was easy to maintain and lasted longer and handled much better than the more expensive hair I purchased before. I will be buying it again. I did have to use conditioner to detangle, but I wore large plaits to sleep at night to keep it from tangling and it did pretty well. Kept in for about 2 months and didn't shed a whole bunch when detangling."
2,"Somethings great, somethings not so great","I immediately returned this after the plastic height adjustment knob broke within minutes after receiving the router. After doing a lot of online research I chose the Hatachi for its power (3 1/4 HP), feature set (variable speed, and plunge), and price. While the motor appears to be nice and powerful, and relatively quite, every thing else about this router is poorly engineered including the height adjustment, plunger uses, lack of access to on/off switch and speed adjustment. Too bad because I was really excited about the bang-for-the-buck of this router"
1,DON'T DO IT !!!!,"I purchased this router 5 months ago and have used it only twice. It is a piece of junk. The built-in stop for the spindle that allows you to tighten the nut holding the bit in gets stuck in the closed position, and you have to work to get it loose. All of the adjustments are cheesy the micro adjustment knob broke the first time I tried to use it, the worst thing is the router now makes a horrible noise and vibrates big time when turned on much like the bearings are defective. I thought about trying to diagnoise the problem but I am afraid to turn it on again. I would never buy another hitachi power tool, proving once again you get what you pay for."
3,No problem with the power.,"I have no problem with the power of this router, but the height adjustment is a joke. The screw threads on the height asjustment shaft, when you turn the lever over to the fine adjustment position, the spring presure pushes the router all the way out. The threads all stripped out the first time I used it. The power, like I said, is fine, the router is quiet, nice router, beyond the fine height adjustment problem."
4,"Not Perfect, best bang for your buck","Ill start by saying that I have 2 of these and one 2 base Hitachi kit (KM12VC) and am very pleased with all of them. As others have noted there are some plastic parts that are a little disappointing, but none of mine have broken so far. I have one mounted and the other for freehand use. The edge guide seems very high quality, but the 1/2 inch collet seems a little thin walled, although I have not noticed the chatter that others have. The dust collection is a nice feature, but doesnt work as well as it could. It may not have the fit and finish of some of the far more expensive routers, but around 200, its price/ features cant be beat, and seeing that I paid much less for mine, I am quite happy. Watch for a sale that occurs quite often, I got the second one for less than 135 delivered, unbeatable for a 3 1/4 HP router."
4,Hitachi M12V2 Router,"Just recently purchased this unit and have only used it a few times, but so far I am very happy with it. Lot's of power, handles easily for a large unit and is quieter then other routers I have used in the past.I believe it's well made and the price point is very good. As a woodworking Hobbyist, I'm sure it will perform just fine for many years."
1,junk made in China,"Folks, what a JUNK........... plastic galore on it.Cheaply made.....came in the box damaged....parts spread out all over in this chinese box......I, reorder it.Second, came in same way. I assume the high school kids at Amazon just put returned items back on the shelf for sale, again.Will never buy Hitachi product. Never"
2,defective collet,"the fact the collet that came with router, was defective,was very dissappointing ruining app. $50 worth of red oak stock made the router very pricy for me the collet was replaced but no before the stock was ruined"
5,hitachi plunge router,"excellent router, handles well. variable speed knob is in handle for easy access on-off switch very convient would buy again"
2,not reliable,"this is the second Hitachi m 12 router I have owened, it is a strong machine HOWEVER they both have died electronicly after the warrent has run out and the replacement part cost is more than half the price of a new router. spend a few dollars more and get something that will last. Dont try calling hatachi, they are more in the dark than you are."
3,new or USED ?,"I meant to give this one star - NOT 3 -- Like others that have reponded, my router (father's day gift) is either damaged in shipping or used or both. When I called to get this rectified, Amazon claimed to no longer have this such a deal router available. What do I do now?? Definitely dissappointed and have had much better experiences with Amazon in the past!"
1,Shipping Damage,"I was tempted by the low price. Like others, mine was probably damaged in shipping, not sure. There were lots of loose items in the box. The speed control wouldn't work. I removed a couple of screws to find the control wheel shaft was broken off in the potentiometer. It's a plastic piece about 1/16 inch in diameter that turns a very small fragile looking potentiometer. After seeing this, I'm returning it for a refund, and will probably order a DeWalt."
4,Knock-off,This product appears to be a pretty good knock-off of the much more expensive Bosch. So far I like it's performance and features and for the price it seems to be a great value. I will try to remember to update this review a year from now.
1,Don't do it!,"I bought and returned two of these routers. I had hoped to get 3 1/4hp for cheap and was disappointed. To start with it was very poorly packaged. Bits didn't fit into the collet, the height adjusting mechanism broke on both of them, the second one(to replace the first) came apart and wouldn't go back onto the rods. My biggest beef with this thing is that it wouldn't fit inside the hole in my router table. I had used an old M12V by Hitachi for eleven years and loved it; cheap hp! This new model looks like something Spiderman would have designed. Spiderman is not a tool designer; he's a superhero. If you want a workhorse router that is simple, fits, and everything works, try the new Triton. I got the 2 1/4hp model which has some of the coolest features ever and I'm happy. Now I'm just waiting on my $176 refund from Amazon..."
5,powerful,"I bought this router two years ago from amazon. I have nothing but good things to say. I mounted it on a bench dog router table and it has performed very well since. I use it with a router raizer for easy up and down movement. I have made many raised panels with this router. Even though some will tell you to make multiple passes with with a large raised panel bit, I don't! Not even in oak. It eats right through it on the first pass. Get your speed right (2-3) so you don't burn or chip and it does great. Even with 1/4 inch shaft bits. Trust me, it's a good buy!"
2,H. Arvesen,"I'm also returning this router after the plastic height adjustment knob broke. I called the Hitachi service center to get a replacement and, even though it's only a $2 part, Hitachi doesn't yet stock parts on this new model. I was excited about using this router and chose the Hatachi for its power (3 1/4 HP), feature set (variable speed, and plunge), and price. I'm disappointed that it didn't live up to my expectations."
4,Balanced Music for Thought,"Decent harp and flute music. Makes me relax, think, contemplate, and take it easy. I'm not big on T'ai Chi, but this is good music to complement most quiet hobbies."
5,Not just for beginners!,"I don't consider myself a beginner but I'm certainly not a Geek either. Yet, this book helps me quickly locate the most frequent questions that I regularly stumble over ... those things I don't do enough to become automatic at them. Changing paper directions, creating mailing labels, cleaning up email forwards, changing my wallpaper, and so many more. I flip to the index, find the topic, go to the quick answer (in large type for those of us who frequently have to hunt for our glasses!) and in seconds, I'm on to the next task. This is the ultimate in easy, fast, and moving on help ... It sits right next to my computer - NOT on the shelf collecting dust!I highly recommend it to anyone and certainly for beginners."
1,Watch out for the deceptive description!,"Description of the product says 12 sets of tabs. It turned out to be A set of 12 tabs. It is cleverly priced, so that 1/12 of the total price closely match other similar products (if it were a case of 12 sets indeed, per unit price will be around $4.49, which is still in the range of similar products). I might be mistaking something here, but it was very disappointing to see only a set of dividers after I paid this much of money. Thought Amazon had better control than...Anyhow, if you are looking for a bunch of month dividers, stay away from this one.PS. If this product is indeed so special, it is worth more than 10x the price of other month tabs, please let me know. I sincerely do not get this."
1,"""This is Blasphemy...""","This CD is pure blasphemy. You don't toy with a master's work and Janet is a true master at what she does. I am sure the intent was good but this is a completely misguided and horrific karaoke project. Every copy of this CD should be rounded up and destroyed immediately. If these were established artists and they had done their own completely different innovative renditions of Janet's masterpieces, then maybe this would be a credible effort. But it's not. My ears will never be the same..."
1,THIS CD SUCKS!!!!!!,"My friend bought this cd for himself but after listeing to it he gave it to me and said ""this cd sucks, but if you like it then keep it, but if you don't let me have it to break"" I was like ok as I wondered how bad can it be? then I listend to it and I can understand why he wanted to break it. It's just a woman who can't sing trying to imitate Janet and it's so pathetic! don't buy this (...)! I think I'm gonna give it to him so he can break it."
