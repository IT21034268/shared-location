3,Goggles just ok.. but they are more kids size,These goggles fit well - I bought them thinking they were a small size but they are actually kids size. They fit fine for a woman with small head however they tend to fog up on the snow.
2,Bolle Youth Goggles,"The description did not say it was for youths, but said it would fit over glasses. I was disappointed when I found out they were smaller than I expected.Good thing I have a couple of boys that fit them just fine, otherwise the goggles are of good quality for the price."
3,Nice but for a small face,"Specs sounded good, prob should have asked if these are for adults and kids, b/c they seem a bit small for my average size face!"
4,good for children,"As other people wrote, this goggle is not for the adults, I think. I bought two for my children. Good price, nice quality."
4,They work as advertised. Great product for the price.,"Ordered two sets of these for my daughters who both wear glasses for a ski/snowmobiling trip.They worked well for both of them. Other than the strap being a little difficult to adjust the firsttime, they were great. On and off over the glasses with no issues even when wearing a helmet.No complaints of fogging on the gogles or glasses which really surprised me."
3,small fitting,The goggles were a bit small in size and couldn't tell if the sides had venting on them and they did not. My son said not to return them and would try to get by with them.
1,childrens goggles,We returned these goggles because they are for a child. The description does not state that.
3,"Good Goggles, bad advertisement","The goggles are high quality and sturdy, but when I got the package it said they were for age 6 and up, which wasn't mentioned at all on the page here. The closest that the page mentioned (briefly) was that they fit a ""small face"", which isn't even that obvious. I'm not going to return them because they aren't ""painful"" to wear and I can always use them as backup goggles in case my main pair breaks, but I wouldn't buy them unless you're buying them for a child or a very petite woman, and I mean VERY..."
3,For Children,"Like others have mentioned, these goggles are for children. If I didn't need them to go snowboarding in a week, I would return them. Although, they fit my face and I can see fine out of them, they don't look quite normal as they are rather small. Listen to the suggestions of the other posters for who to buy this item for."
1,"my glasses barely fit in there, and it's painful wear both my glasses and goggles at the same time","my glasses barely fit in there, and it's painful wear both my glasses and goggles at the same time"
2,"Disappointing, At Best","I just finished reading this book and I'm sorry I spent moneyon it. First, the ENTIRE murder mystery ""plot"" takes place inONE paragraph on the last page of the book. Give me a break!There are lots of mistakes about timing and character situationswhich don't make sense and are jarring to the reader. The restof the book can best be described as a romantic comedy. Evenmore unbelievable is the ending -- which I cannot reveal, butwhich I can say is truly incredulous to even the most tolerantof readers, and just too convenient for the heroine. As far asplot and quality of writing, the book's puppy could have done abetter job! Only plus, the character talks like a female SamSpade -- easy to read and humorous at times, but also loaded withlots of Valley Girl phrases (do I really care what kind ofdesigner shoes Bob's wife wears?). I'm hard pressed to givethis one even two stars."
5,80's Decadence Meets Pure Evil...,"This is a great collection of shorts some feel a bit dated but, having grown up in the era of excess there's a certain appeal (and creepiness) to the decadent sex and violence of these stories. Being a big fan of horror fiction and horror films it's rare that i stumble across anything new and unique, this is one of the rare exceptions.Taking it's cue from the old pulp novels and horror comics these stories are all about what goes gravely wrong when you pursue the wrong vice.Some of the stories are truly horrifying simply 'cause these are the worst case scenarios that rumble around the back of your mind when you decide to pick up an attractive stranger or go home with a ""new friend"" from the local pub.I was so impressed i sought out the nearly entire collection (11+ collections at this point the newest are contemporary and still spooky as hell!).Great Stuff!!!"
4,Quick introduction to Bali and Java; very current,"This recent travelogue for Bali and (largely central) Java paints a very good portrait. It's a quick read, but still manages to immerse the reader in the areas covered. The book consists of short anecdotal scenes, each describing a specific encounter in such a way that you feel you were there."
5,"Great, easy, inexpensive recipes","I collect cookbooks, and I keep coming back to this one over and over again. I have been amazed with how EVERY recipe I try is easily prepared in less than 30 minutes and turns out delicious. Most of her recipes are easily converted to vegan by leaving out the cheese. I keep buying copies to give to friends, and then they tell me that they have bought copies to give to their friends. I have brought the White Beans and Sage dish to several potlucks and it's been the hit of the party. I hope Ms. Fritschner comes out with another book."
3,Not Totally Vegetarian,"There are some good recipes in this book, but she relies heavily on cheese, and cheeses that only available with animal rennet - made from the organs of newborn calves. Hardly something a vegetarian wants to eat. If you ignore that and substitute cheeses with vegetable rennet or only use the recipes sans cheese, there's still enough here to make a worthwhile purchase."
4,Blast From the Past,"True, the special effects are minimal but the movies are better than I remembered. I watched The Crawling Eye for 4 days in a row years ago on the Million Dollar Movie and loved every minute of it (at 9 years old) and I was suprised to find it hadn't become too laughable like so many other Scifi movies from the 50's I've seen. True, the crawling eye itself is not Jurassic Park scarey but My 19 year old daughter even enjoyed it! Invaders from Mars was pretty good too, although the aliens are kinda corney it's still a fun movie to watch. And, the bonus British version was a great addition, in fact I liked the British ending much better!! All in all they're both good to watch on a Saturday night with some popcorn and remember how scared you were the first time you saw them, way back when."
2,Terrible Print - Memorable Movie,"This movie (Invaders) had an eerie feel that stayed with me since I was a kid. I watched this DVD with an adult friend who had never seen it before. He had a dream about it the next night! I had my share as a kid too. Have you ever seen the ""ant eater"" - a little bug that burrows, makes a cone-like hole, then waits for ants to fall in? I wonder if it inspired this film in any way?!Regrettably, as others have said, the print is just terrible. Constant lines through the film. Hopefully someone will restore the film if this is the best that is out there. Having ""The Crawling Eye"" packaged with this is an added bonus."
2,Not as Good as I Remember,"I had not seen these on TV for decades. I remember them as being the scariest movies while growing up. I was disappointed in the movies. They were not scary and were slow moving. I did like seeing the ""head"" Martian in the glass globe again in ""Invaders"" and the Crawling Eyes being burned.I have seen ""Them"" over the years and that still holds up. I also like ""Forbidden Planet,"" even with the low tech technology.I guess I should have rented ""The Crawling Eye"" and ""Invaders from Mars"" before/instead of buying."
4,Soul Magic,"The story is very good and keep you reading. The onlyproblem for me was the magic played ""against"" Christian believe.Younger insecure christians can be influence. I do not believe it was the writer' s idea."
4,"Great color, OK coverage","I picked up this item and used it immediately. The color is nothing like the swatch shown. It's more like a true denim blue with very fine glitter. It's really beautiful and great for every day wear. The only downside is that the polish is rather transparent and the brush is narrow. I had to put on three coats, and they dried fairly quickly, but there are still streaks. I won't put on a fourth coat for fear of it peeling off. So that's a negative but otherwise I love it for the great color! A definite buy if you wear denim!"
3,mckettricks bundle,i really enjoyed receiving this book. it is really good to purchase bundles because you can follow the story lines from book to book and not lose interest
1,ill-informed drivel,"It is astonishing that this author is even able to hold pen to paper. The so-called universities from which he received his degrees need to have their charters yanked for bestowing anything to this moron. Where he doesnt know or cannot find facts, he makes them up. This non-sense should be categorized under ""fiction."" Do not waste your money buying this book. Do not waste your time reading it. I trust the National Inquirer more than this idiot. I gave this book one star because there isn't a way to give it NEGATIVE stars"
1,rainy day,"I have other working mp3s. Bought this one as a no-worry item for kayaking. It will not recognize sd cards. Somehow I think the tech is ok....plastic is cheap, concept is right on though...but the will-not-work outa the box is kinda a let down. Will save the little ripoff for a project some rainy day."
2,Unfortunate Christmas Decision,I purchased this for my son for Christmas. I tried everyting I could to get the player to work but it simply would not recognize anything. By the time the holidays rolled around I was unable to return it to the site so I had to get a RMA from the manufacturer.
2,This is ugly non-supported product.,"This player can read only up to 256mb, It can't read the memory SanDisk 2Gb,1Gb I don't know about 512Mb couse I don't have it. I never recomend it to my friend.I can't find the firmware for this player and support by internet.I hate an iPod, but I realy disapointed by this product too. Be aware!"
3,good for the price,"I used this for ca. half year, as a digital walkman, found out it's picky on the file it can play, battery runs out pretty quick, best one is copper top ca. 8h, toshiba 4-5h, generic 2-4h, sound quality is very good (playing the symphonys), very very simple to drop and drag, no installation of any driver/software, play mode repeat one/all/random (eh!). These dap's need not be so small so people with bad eye sight or big fingers can't use them so a smart manufacturer out there should think about this demograp market sector: baby boomers who care less about skin deep beauty but more and know about true value performance and practicality, and who also have $$$...I have used a few dap's, and found that anyone says their AAA lasts >8h is lying, and do look for one that does not use the battery door as an eletrode. And I won't bother about anything that recharges itself with built-in Li-whaterver-other-ion."
5,Well worth the money!,"My kids each received one of these for Christmas and we have had absolutely no problems with either one. In fact one went through the wash (left in jeans pocket) and once it dried overnight it still worked fine! I would highly recommend this MP3. Easy to use, rugged, and a great value for the money. This one gets my 5 stars!"
2,You get what you paid for it,"Display too small, have to eject and reinsert the SD card after every powerdown. This unit goes through batteries very quickly. The sound is fine, headphones are sub par.Spend a bit more and get a nicer unit!"
2,Just for show,"After seeing a YouTube video of an elderly English man using the glass pen and explaining what it was, I was dying to get one. I ordered it and when I got it, I couldn't wait to use it. I was so disappointed by the writing quality of the pen compared to the one the man had on YouTube. The pen leaks a lot of ink, and then suddenly runs dry. You have to rub it a few more times in order for it to start writing again. Overall, just to write a couple of words is like Mission Impossible. I'm dissatisfied with this product and would NOT recommend it."
5,"Honest, vulnerable, revealing, and brilliant!","I'm so excited about this book! Once I picked it up I couldn't put it down. I was captivated. Rhonda is 100% honest and vulnerable in sharing with us her own personal body image issues. She is one of us, a friend, relating and connecting with us as no other author does. She is brilliant! I will never again think of my body the same way. I love my body now. Thank you Rhonda! What a gift you have given to us. Bj Garnaus"
4,Do I look fat in this?,"Very similar thread to Rhonda's Fearless Living Books and yet as you get further into the book it becomes more meaningful, as far as weight and image are concerned."
5,wrds of wizdumb review,this was a gift aswell to someone who enjoys games of this sort.theyre truly pleased w. it and i couldnt be happier either !
5,Great BUY!!,"I just installed this fan in my case after adding a Ge Force FX 5500 to my computer, and it is amazing how much air this thing can take care of. My new video card and my Pentium 4 stay 5x cooler. This thing moves so much air I actually had to buy some round IDE cables because my old flat IDE cables we're flapping around inside my case because of the suction from the fan! This is a great buy, and a must have if you need to get the heat out of your case. Noise is not really a problem for me, if it is for you, just download speedfan to take care of the fan's rpm's. Once again thank you so much newegg.com!!"
2,SO LOUD,"Dear Emperor! This is so loud. SO LOUD. No single audio file does this justice: The Tornado is the loudest fan I've ever had the displeasure of using.If you keep this like, on a separate floor, than where you intend to be most of the time, then go for it. Otherwise, STAY AWAY.So loud."
2,"Loud, half a fan, and generally not impressed.","The fan is only half the hight of the fan case! It's deceptive to make the fan case double hight, implying that the fan inside is that high, when the fan is (as far as I can see) exactly the same as any other 19mm thick fan. The blades are NOT pulling any extra air in. Not only that, the fan is loud! I guess with a name like ""Tornado"" I should have known better, but this fan is amazingly loud, you can hear it in the next room with the door closed. Not recommended."
3,good for reference,"This book can be used for quick reference, but this book alone may not help to clear the exam."
5,"Experienced developers, this is the only book needed!",This book does an excellent job of highlighting the key aspects of the exam. I passed the exam easily scoring 857.Write a book for 70-100 - PLEASE!
5,A MUST have for 70-175 exam,An excellent preparation guide for the exam. Most of the question were either on the exam or very similar to the exam. Please review it to pass (as I did in my first attempt- :-)).
2,"Not as good as claimed, buyers beware!","I used this book to prepare for the distributed exam because of the great reviews it had. But if not for the MeasuareUp test preparation software, I would've passed the exam at all."
3,Way Off,The thermostat keeps a narrow temperature range which is good. The only problem is that the temperature setting dial is about 6-8 degrees off. I set it at 60 to get a 67 degree room.
2,i dont have the lux ones but i have thermostats that look the same,i do have these kind of thermostats.. that plate that expands i dont understand why its so horrible. i adjusted mine with that screw at the bottom of the plate and they work but still they are annoying with temp swings.. digital is the way to go.
1,Unrated,I ordered this on my kindle but for some reason it would not download. I wanted to read it while on my vacation in Orlando but it would not download there either. Finally when I returned home I went online and it finally downloaded. Have not read yet but was disappointed about this download. I have not experienced this problem with Amazon before this.
3,"A good book, just not a great book","I read this book looking for two things; 1. an autobiographical account of a man's relationship with his father, 2. an autobiographical account of a man's experience with the vietnam war. These were both covered in this book. Carroll does a good job telling a story. His book falls apart when discussing the emotions of the time. It left me unconvinced of his sincerity behind the themes of the book. He ""drops names"" of people he knew in the anti war movement as if to give himself validity. It seemed to be an attempt at grasping for legitimacy as the rebel son of a powerful government figure. Certainly he only needed to tell the story and let the facts speak for legitimacy. A good book, but just not a great book."
2,A one sided dissident's view of a complicated issue,"A Jansenist Roman Catholic father and a dissident uncommitted Priest-son square off for a lifetime of bitterness and recrimination. I am not sure this book should have been written. I would like to have heard the side of the father, General Joe Carroll. The author and narrator, has the self righteous attitude that turned me off.Viet Nam was a complex issue. He oversimplifies it and villifies his dad.Thumbs down for me"
5,An Extraordinary Story,"This beautifully written tale of the impact of Vietnam on a general's family may be the most compelling autobiography I have read in recent years. Carroll's unique position, torn between his loyalty to his powerful father, the intractable Catholic Church, and his own shaky vocation enables him to present a fresh prospective on the war and its impact, quite literally, at home. A absolute must-read, this is a book to be savored"
3,Tough read,This was a tough book for me to read having lived through the Vietnam war and as a person producing weapon systems for the Vietnam war.
5,Some clues lie here,"If you are one of the many trying to understand how the religion of your upbringing and the cold of your father colliding with the Viet Nam war impacted your choices and your outlook, then this is a read for you. A stirring memoir of a boy who is immersed in religion by parents, no a father who thought religion would educate his son. A home empty of relationships provides no comfort nor support for a boy confronting the difficulties of puberty and the 60's. An easy answer seems declaring one's self to serving God where one can also escape the overwhelming problems of women, sex, identity and direction. The coming of age happens in the midst of war. A war no one can figure out, not a previous previous insider father or a new priest with plenty of questions. If you lived through this time, or if you wondered about this time the 60's and if you lived through paternal turmoil, or wondered how much turmoil God, a father and a war could wreck, then this is a read for you."
4,worth persevering,"By the end of this book I found it engaging, fascinating, moving, and tragic, but I thought it was hard to follow at first and am curious if any other readers felt the same. Emotional relationships are subtle and complicated, and I felt at first that Carroll's description of his relationship with his father was somewhat oblique, and that he stated their attitudes and feelings without really illustrating where they came from. I eventually decided, however, that I could only grasp the significance of the effects of the 60s on their relationship once I had worked my way through the chapters covering Carroll's boyhood and adolescence. I also thought the book was a useful source of information (albeit probably subjective) about events in the 60s and 70s that don't get taught in school."
4,White Lizzy,"This is an adorable little doll (Maggie's Closet (Lizzy) - Toywith such cute clothes and even accessories. I don't think the age rating is appropriate at 3yrs and up as the clothing is sometimes difficult for me to put on and take off (educationally, it helps with dexterity though). So, if YOU want to play dolly dress up, keep the clothes out....I personally put them away when I'm not in the mood to dress them. Nicely made dolls except for the hair, but how do you make yarn hair sturdy?!! It is what it is.....I'd definitely buy her again though."
2,Not interesting,"I was looking for something better than this. It was a coloring book and I thought it was a reading book. It did have good coloring pictures, but I was looking for something more. I was disappointed when it arrived. My fault I just didn't realize it was a coloring book."
4,Thank God for Cliff Notes,"Although this book doesn't have any inspiring ideas or new theories about Milton's Paradise Lost, it does help to understand what the heck happens. The Cliff Notes explains the characters, their history, and biblical references that many people don't fully know. Its a tad boring but it's much better than the actual thing! If you want to pass your test or write a B- essay on Paradise Lost you'll need this book to do it."
1,For Children?,"I looked all over the cover of the book for something that states that this book was meant for children. Within every page are definitions to any large word. For example, in one chapter detailing Al Capone, its stated in one incident he sent down thugs to election booths to rough up voters, it then followed in parenthesis a definiton of what an election booth was. Over and over this book has definitions for the simplest words. Its too the point of annoyance. IF I didnt know better, id say this book was one long joke poking fun at people's intelligence."
4,Breathing new life into Spiderman,"I just can't believe how much I'm enjoying Ultimate Spiderman, and this collection is the best story arc yet.Brian Michael Bendis flawlessly introduces two major villains from Spiderman's rogue gallery, Doc Octopus and Kraven the Hunter. There is such a quality to this work, such an attention to detail. Bendis is really building this series from the ground up, really breathing new life and fleshing out Peter Parker. And while Bendis respects the history of Spiderman, he by no means is hampered by it, and has no problem discarding details that make no sense.Mark Bagley is definitely improving as this series progresses. I have been really quite impressed, it seems his storytelling is improving, and the action is very easy to follow. To me, Bagley has become a part of the book, an integral part of the experience.This is a very intelligent Spider-title, and it only stands that it will get better and better, as has been the case so far."
4,Spidey Fights Doc Ock and Kraven,"Doc Ock looks great in this story but maybe a little bit too muscular? I mean he's a scientist with no notable genetic enhancements a la Green Goblin in this series. Kraven looks good as well, but not really a worthy adversary. This book is alright and somewhat longer than the 2nd volume."
5,Incredible Album,"I heard ""Tonight"" on the Shield during a scene and have been looking for the artist for a bit and I finally found the singer and I am so happy I got the album. From beginning to end it has a mixture of melon collie and uplifting beats, but it has a really soothing tone to it. Every time I put his album on I raise the volume on my speakers. In short, I love the album and i highly recommend it. I like a large variety of bands and music and this is at my top 5 artists. Again, such a great album, can't wait for his next one whenever that is."
4,An interesting exploration of power.,"I was surprised when I started the book because it had a new protagonist, and Ged, from the first book, plays a more minor role.Where the first book was about exploring identity and values, this book was more about power. The protagonist, Tenar, is made a high priestess of the nameless ones from the earth. She has dominion over her temple, but she is bound to her role and doesn't have the freedom that would come with knowledge. Much of the book was about her coming to terms with this and moving beyond it.I didn't enjoy it as much as the first book, but it was interesting nonetheless."
5,Cutting Edge PowerPoint 2007 for Dummies is NOT just for dummies,"As a presentation designer and author ofPresentational Skills for the Next Generationeven I found inspiration within the contents of this delightful book. Yes, delightful is the operative word. Geetesh Bajaj's sense of humor sprinkled throughout was a refreshing change from ordinary skills books. His mix of clear explanations and helpful hints prove his credentials and expertise with PowerPoint are solidly established. If you are looking to add to your knowledge quickly or are just learning how to add the power of PowerPoint presentations to your marketing program this is the book you will want to read from cover to cover. And don't miss the free CD with Bonus Chapter, tools and resources too."
4,Honest Prince listener.heard every song,"Like many I own all his cd's. This cd I give 4 stars only b/c it is better than the other crap out now.There is only one great song(P.E.), one good song(Chelsea Rodgers)on this cd and 2 more (A.M.I.T.W, The One U)worth hearing.After reading what songs other people like, I now feel sorry for Prince.Songs I hate and think suck, other people like.So what must Prince think? I'm a fan of his ballads, but all the ballads on this cd suck and there are no catchy hooks. He is energetic on this cd but this isn't the cd where every song is good.I mean Mr.Goodnight really sucks. Prince's latest albums that were good to me were: The Truth, One Nite Alone, Rainbow Children, and half of 3121. The others for the most part sucked."
4,This is a good CD,"Let's face it, Prince was in the zone from 1982 to 1988. During that period he could do no wrong. Planet Earth is not from that period. Compared to more recent stuff, I think Planet Earth is better than Musicology but not as good as 3121.To me, there are 3 stand out tracks: Guitar, The One U Wanna C, and Chelsea Rodgers. Guitar is a catchy little pop-rocker. The One U Wanna C vocals are laid down very well and this too is catchy. Chelsea Rodgers is relentless disco-funk.The rest of the songs are good and well written. There is an overall brightness to the tunes on Planet Earth. Like I said, this is no masterpiece, but it's worth the $15 you shell out."
2,Huge disappointment,"I do not like this CD at all,because I am such a fan I listened to it several timestrying to like it.I can best describe this music as soft rock,there are only 2 trackswith any hints of funk and soul,and those tracks are mediocre at best.Save your money."
3,I'm a little disappointed,"Let me first say that nobody can touch this man musically and as far as overall talent goes. I own everything Prince has released and then some.The is the 2nd release from Prince where I found myself only appreciating 3-4 tracks. The only other release I can say the same thing about was Grafiti Bridge. I also disagree that this is an attempt to recapture his Purple Rain days and that sound.There are a handful of songs on here that sound like it was thrown together in a rush. Musicology and 3121 blows Planet Earth away.I like Prince the best when he metaphorically sticks his middle finger up at the mainstream and just surrounds himself with great jazz and funk musicians. Not a horrible cd, but definitely a shockingly dissapointing. And it's not even about him trying new things or pleasing the fans. I can honestly say that this is the first cd that consists of songs that are just bad musically, and that isn't like Prince. I struggled to give this 3 stars."
3,"Nice, but it could be better.","Purchased this for my mom because she had heard one of the songs and loved it. She has played the CD twice and found that she only likes a couple of the songs and doesnt really care for the rest. She doesnt hate them, but just wishes she'd listened to samples a little more before getting the cd. I know Prince is worthy of better music then this, so I would pass on buying this CD. There is nothing worse then spending money on a CD only to find you dont care for anything but the one song you knew you already liked."
3,Buy 3121 Instead,"Or go back and get old stuff you don't have. Seriously there are a couple of really good tracks that I would recommend you buy on Itunes if it were on there. Guitar is catchy, Revelation is good, and a couple of the ballads are great stuff. But the record is mediocre following 3121 which was great, and Musicology before it (which I rate just below 3121). Somehow there's just not a clear focus for this record, and it is just sort of mellow without a real drive. 3121 was stellar - on a par with Sign O the Times, and many of our man's fantastic records."
5,"Prince Will Always be The King of Rock, Funk, R&B and Soul","Planet Earth is a good cd........ Prince will always play rock,funk,r&b, soul and jazz...... As you can see on this cd....... And this is one reson why he is in the Rock & Roll Hall.... Those who are new to Prince go buy his 2 Cd Prince-Prince 1979 Very hard rock..... Yes, Planet Earth is truly good.... Just give it a little time."
2,Hearing himself,"2 1/2It's always sad to see once vital artists trail off into irrelevance, and although Prince has aged more gracefully than many of his long standing peers, it is impossible to ignore the creeping vanity driving more vacant compositions over the years, masking perhaps as diversity or even self-myth. There are fleeting moments of greatness if you seek it, but it sounds stuck between a whole lot of pseudo-get-down, and some clunky genre experiments, both which of course produce at least one impressive exception to avoid complete erosion."
3,Planet Earth,"I loved the Planet Earth song, and that was about it. The rest sounds like elevator music to me. The holograph is awesome and the reason why I bought this c.d. It is worth it for that and the one great song on it."
2,just ok,"this album along with the past two other albums over the past few years sound like Purple Recycleables. alot of these tracks just have vault written all over them. alot of 2nad 3rd tier reject tracks which cover a stylistic style and theme that Prince did back in the 80's. these tracks sound like quite a few of Prince's 90's material which are run of the mill. He never up-dated his sound and needed a new sound, songwriter and editor. His Business Savvy is of late is on point,but the Music has been lacking for 20 years."
2,A weak effort for the Master,"After a second day of listening, I'll say its groovy, but definitely weakNot nearly as bad as ""Rave un2 the joy fantastic"" which I rank as his only really Bad albumBut its borderlineCompletely lacks any tune that makes u involuntarily shout out a james brown ugh!Also lacks any lines I'd send out in a 2 am txt messageThe album as a whole seems to lack any identity of its own, its just kinda blahWhereas other albums take u on a ride, this one kinda just sits there"
4,one of his best from this century,"I enjoyed this album a lot. Prince goes back to a more guitar approach and compact songwriting. The funk is less on this album, but it still has some great tracks: ""Planet Earth"", ""Chelsea Rodgers"", ""Guitar"", ""The One U Wanna C"", Somewhere Here On Earth"", ""Lion Of Judah"" are all top notch. The remaining 4 tracks are more or less filler. More open than musicology and less manufactured than 3121. Prince is steadily getting back to his old form. Could his next album be a real classic again?"
5,"crisp, clean, classic Prince","classic prince sound that crosses over much of his early WB and Paisley Park days. its not an overdrawn, long CD. nice for that quick prince fix. i love it"
4,Prince Planer Earth,"Good Album. At 49 Prince has still got it. Nothing beats his creativity, live instruments, and guitar playing. Some songs are throw away, but good overall."
1,Free for a reason,"Been a Prince fan for years. Enjoyed just about everything he has done, including his fan club only releases. This album does nothing for me. You can probably get it on ebay for cheap because millions of people in London got it for free in the mail. You should get it free too. It's not worth much more."
1,another mediocre release from Prince,I am a die hard Prince fan so trust me when I say this is apretty bad CD. There is only one decent song on this isChelsea Rodgers. The rest is crap and sounds a lot like thesongs from last few bad CDs Prince has done. I'll probablykeep buying new Prince CDs to keep my collection up but itappears the old Prince we knew and loved is gone.
2,As long as he's having fun..,"Thats all that matters. The fluff-piece that is ""Guitar"" cruelly fades out just as he's starting an all-out assault with his Strat, another track has a glint of the Linn LM-1. I turn the music off, and put on ""Controversy"" instead. With a back catalogue that is the stuff of gods, theres no point in hanging around in this future..."
4,Mostly all good stuff!,"The last Prince album I bought was Diamonds and Pearls, which I still play to death. This latest is right up my street. It's classy, classic Prince. 'Guitar' is out and out a blast. I play it very loud on my car stereo on the way to work (and I'm a 52 year old mother of teenagers.) Title track 'Planet Earth' has spot on lyrics which put me in mind of 'Imagine', 'The One U Wanna C' is pure pop, and Chelsea Rodgers is just a great fun and funky track. I freely admit I prefer the rockers to the ballads, but it's all good."
2,1 good song..that's it,"Except for the title track, the rest of the album is boring and forgettable. Chelsea Rodgers could have been great but it was stuck in a rut and didn't go anywhere. Prince is still the greatest ever but he needs to release the incredible 80's music from the vault. Thats the stuff that's timeless. His current music is uninspired, self-indulgent, and preachy."
5,It's Prince all the way baby!,Man does this guy ever age? Looks and sounds as great as always.. A must have for any true Prince fan...
4,This is a great album!,"I was never really a big Prince fan. Sure, I liked all the classics from the late 70's and through the 80's but never owned a prince album before in my life. I just have some of the hits on collection CD's.A couple of weeks ago I was carpooling to work with a co-worker and he put this CD on. I was floored by what I heard! I had always had respect for Prince as an acomplished song writter and performer but this album for me was great from track 1 to 10. My favorite song on this album is ""Mr. Goodnite"" For me it's classic Prince and takes me a-back to classic ""old school"" rap. My co-worker plays that CD about every day that I ride with him and the More I listened the more I knew that I had to go buy my first Prince album ever. It makes me wonder what I have been missing in past releases. I highly recomend this great artistic album from a very talented artist."
4,"For us long time fans, this one is worth it","I bought the CD mostly because, as a major Prince fan, I tend to buy all of his CDs. It's an impulse, not a researched, purchase. My first piece of pre-recorded music that I bought was _Purple Rain_, as a 10 year old...I've been in love with the genius that is Prince ever since.While I haven't been unhappy with the last 2 CDs, I wasn't fully satisfied...and judging by what others on here say, I'm clearly not alone. But upon listening to the grooves of ""Planet Earth"" and the subsequent songs on _Planet Earth_, I have to say that this is about as satisfied as I have been in a long time with Prince. Just like _Purple Rain_ and _Diamonds and Pearls_ (my absolute 2 favorite CDs of all time), the songs on _Planet Earth_ hit all the notes: sensual, blusey, gutteral rock, classic funk and R&B...I; am 98% sated. It's not as good as the other two, but it's definitely one to have the in permanent rotation."
2,Average at best.,"I just don't get this one. I actually LIKED Musicology. I thought 3121 was just something Prince just tossed off in the studio from stuff in his vaults.But this...this is much worse.Even my kids, who are age 6 and 8 and die hard Prince fans, aren't feeling the album. It is NOT good if a kid picks the Curious George soundtrack over your most recent release."
2,Disappointed :(,"Like another reviewer mentioned, due to critical praises I expected a lot more from Prince's latest CD, but was let down. I like a couple of the songs, but I'm not crazy about them, which for a crazy Prince fan like me, is a big downer. Oh well, thankfully I have all his previous other great stuff to listen to (which I'm doing right now)."
3,Buying Prince,"I love Prince, so I tried to buy all his music. I always find some song I can't live without. This time was not the case. I liked a couple of songs, but I'm glad I bought this used. But if you love Prince, then this is better than fair."
3,Factory Expiermental,"As a fan of Prince one of the things I have noticed is once in a while he will bring forth a ""concept"" album simular to the ""Black Album"" where he tries different approches, listens to the feed back from fans then steps up to produce something outstanding the next go round. Most true fans have come to understand how he works: Something fantastic, then something OK, then something in a completly different direction then something truly funky. This one is his different direction session...not a major hits maker..but it does have some items that will stimulate conversation...untill the next shoe drops..."
2,Hmmm... Not Exactly ....,"I have been a fan since I was 11 years old.. yeah back in 1981!Prince is still THE artist of our time, before his time.But I think he missed the boat with this CD.I sometimes have to listen a couple of times before deciding what I like on his CDs, but I can't get thru this CD a second time. I do not enjoy it, and its sad to say, but true.I enjoyed Musicology, but haven't REALLY loved a cd of his since Emancipation. Once you start to see Prince on Verizon Wireless commercials, you know its a different time....Hope he brings the funk back the next time around.. many of us who have been fans from the beginning will be waiting.."
1,Save Your Money,"I ordered this album largely due to the many good reviews posted here. I expected strong material and some good jams.The album contains neither.Compared to Purple Rain, 1999, or Prince's other early strong material, this deserves no stars at all.Boring. You won't want to listen even a second time."
2,I like Prince but....,"this CD has to grow on me. It's Prince and I'm a fan. I wouldn't encourage anyone to buy it, but I wouldn't send mine back either."
4,FAN 4 LIFE,"I have to admit that track 8 on Planet Earth is my favorite. However, because I've been listening to Prince since I was a 6th grader (I'm 40 now), I enjoy just about all of his music because there are so many adventures through different issues and cultures of the world. Someone such as myself understands what freedom for a real artist is, thus I enjoy and understand the work of many artists past and present. If your mind is closed and shallow, you'll probably say you don't like this or many other artists music, so to all of them I say stand up, open up, and just let it all go my friend."
2,Prince Plays US again!,"Like almost every album since ""purple rain"", Prince continues his 'trick' of releasing one very catchy pop/rock song from an album to persuade people to pick up the album. Unfortunately, that one song is the only thing of any worth on the whole album! The rest continues his self indulgent mishmash of ""funk/slow jam/jazz infused/nothing catchy"" music.I learned my lesson a long time ago. Sample the ENTIRE prince cd BEFORE YOU BUY IT!"
1,Planet Turd,"I'm a huge fan from way back and still feel that Prince is one the most prolific artists of our time. Buttttttt...this is arguably his worst album to date, in my humble opinion. For a guy who has written some great pop songs over the years, this batch is embarrassing."
3,"Not a FULL review, but this has to be said....","I've only heard this twice so far, so I can't make a full review yet. HOWEVER, this MUST be said:1- ""Mr. Goodnight"" might as well be ""Gimme one more Chance"" from Biggie. That's not cool.2- Chelsea Rodgers SLAMS- that song is worth the disc alone!!!Ok, I'll be back later!"
1,I guess Musicology was the last one...,"I'm a die hard Prince fan, and as such, I must say that Planet Earth sucks. I was hoping that 3121 was a one-time disappointment...but i was wrong. I wish I could get my money back. Sad to say, but I think the Prince who gave us classics like ""Let's Go Crazy"", ""Adore"", ""Purple Rain"", ""Kiss"", etc etc etc (the list goes on and on)...is dead."
1,Not a nickel would I spend...,"If sales of this CD featuring ""various artists"" help Stan's widow and family, so be it; but I cannot in good conscience recommend it to anyone to whom this music really means something.I had to listen to one of my old Stan Rogers albums to hear the real thing and get this pale imitation out of my system."
1,sunk off bermuda,"Couldn't agree more with other reviewers. This cd should be scuttled off the cape and never see the light of day again. Choice of songs was fine, but the execution was dreadful. Best to get the originals, mp3s, etc."
1,"I Intensly love the work of Stan Rogers, but not this","I really hesitate to ever criticize any artistry, but I am a die-hard Stan Rogers fan (and of his brother Garnet too, who is great in his own right). However, with a very few exceptions (such as white squall), I'm afraid this is one item I would not recommend. I don't like to say it, honestly, but if you're interested in getting to know the work of Stan Rogers, I really hope you don't use this CD as your introduction, or you'll be completely mislead. I don't wish any bad feelings to the musicians who put it together, but I'm afraid I really feel most of them missed the mark."
4,Chapin sprayer,Chapin makes excellent products. I use this and other Chapin products for spraying concrete sealer. This sprayer is built to take everyday use.
4,Means to get a mold lab test done,"This is just a basic kit with instructions, 6x tape strips, and 2x bags for collect mold samples. You then use the envelop provided to mail samples to a lab, which costs 20$ per test/analysis - which takes about a week to get returned. It basically just gives you a real easy straightforward means to get a lab test done. The kit is probably not worth the ten bucks to some, but it could be. The only thing I couldn't find prior to ordering it was how much the lab tests cost, which is 20$, a reasonable amount compared to other places."
3,mold detection kit,"This is simple to use. The results are sent quickly - the only drawback - each little sample taken costs $20 - yes, that's $20 for a strip of what looks like - scotch tape. I could only afford two. The allergist will help me define the results. Connie B"
2,Not what the title implies,"It is not very interesting. He repeats his few insights numerous times and it is so dated as to be irrelavant today. Sorry because his architectural work is magnificant, his writings are just lost in time."
4,A Lot of Choices,This book is loaded with patterns. They are laid out very well and easy to follow. It is not a technique book. One improvement would be that small pictures of the finished products would have helped with choosing patterns.
5,Native Beading,Very nice. Displays full size patterns for beading. It had designs thatI wasn't familiar with. Good Find for beginner to immediate beaders.
3,Authentic American Indian Beadwork and How to Do It: With 50 Charts for Bead Weaving and 21 Full-Size Patterns for Applique,"This book was a bit of a disappointment. There is some instruction for doing beadwork, but the print is in a very small font--making it difficult to read. The only color pictures are on the front and back covers--using both sides of the cover. All charts are in black and white. The markings in the charts are rather light, making them difficult to see. The patterns are for loom or square stitch and applique only. The book does not do justice to the rich heritage of Native American art and the great diversity in their use of beadwork."
5,"The Answer to ""Why is that?"" and ""How did that happen?""","I received this book from a family member many years ago. I like history and exploration, and there is much of that. I probably started and put it down 4-5 times, not because of any deficienmcy in the book, but because I could not put together the time to really read and enjoy it. I kept having to start at the beginning. Finally, about four years ago, I read it through over a period of about a month. I have recommended it to each of my now grown kids. I think it a rare book in many ways. It succeeds on so many levels. Happy to give it my highest recommnedation."
4,great book - no conclusion though,"The Discoverers is an extraordinarily erudite survey of some of the more important discoveries in the history of man. It does it all, from the invention of zero to the circumnavigation of the globe to the invention of paper money to biological categorization to the history of the discovery of ways to measure time. It is an easy read despite its length and would present no difficulties to the historical layman. I have one quibble, though: the book presents no conclusion, instead it sort of peeters out at the end. After spending a good week getting through the book it is kind of disappointing to be left with no clue as to what it all meant.The index is solid and the biobliographical notes very useful. There are no endnotes."
4,Informative,"Daniel Boorstin has a reputation second to none. I had this book as a World History Textbook at West Point. Loaded with information. My only complaint is that, at times, the prose gets somewhat wordy and hard to follow. I had to take physical notes to follow it at times. Other than that, very educational, though not that reader friendly."
3,NOTE TO UNIV OF PHOENIX STUDENTS,"This is only for University of Phoenix students. If you are taking History of Human Discovery HIS/458, this is the textbook and correct version for the class. Do not bother spending more money and $11+ for shipping. Buy it here and save yourself $$. Better yet, buy one of the used copies for a dollar or so. Just wanted to pass this along..."
1,NEVER AGAIN,THE BOOK STILL HAS NOT ARRIVED! WHAT A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY! I WOULD LIKE MY MONEY BACK.I ORDERED THE BOOK FOR SCHOOL 2 WEEKS 9/2/11 BEFORE THE CLASS STARTED AND I AM IN MY LAST WEEK OF CLASS AND NO BOOK. I HAD TO GO TO BARNES AND NOBLES AND BUY THE BOOK! WHICH COST ME $18.00 BUT IT TOOK ALL OF 5 MINUTES TO DO IT. I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THIS VENDOR AGAIN!
4,"Wonderful book, but not for everyone...","Like others here I found the book fantastic and quite effective in sustaining our interests. However, there are parts that are simply not for the novice reader. People who lack a reference frame in history (which includes many people who never went beyond what they learned in high school) will have difficulty following the web he weaves. Also, some aspects of the book will clearly appeal to everyone (e.g. clocks, evolution) but others are somewhat uncommon and a bit more difficulty to follow, such as his treatment of topology. In fact, some of the connections he makes on that subject are not so evident... Therefore I recommend the book, but I would warn those who try to use it as an introductory text."
4,So comprehensive it's sickening,"An unbelievable portrait of the history of man. From ancient Babylonians and the early Roman Empire to present day, Boorstin shows us how men and women through the Ages have expanded their minds and instruments, reaching past the sceptics and those who would keep the status quo. Boorstin 's work is thorough and blended well. I never thought a book of this nature would capture my attention so completely."
5,a great book for history lovers,"I love this book! Daniel J. Boorstin depicts parts of history that you don't learn in a classroom. He teaches the in depth parts of our culture by going beyond what made people the most famous, and teaches what other great things they have done in their lives. He answers questions people have been wondering in their every day lives and expands on it. I have learned so much about what humans have done to improve and to educate each generation, and amazed at what some have discovered without recognition. I can't put this book down, and that's why I love it the most"
3,A Good Read,"This was fairly good reading, but there are a few problems. First, it seems dry and worded with little vigor. Second, the author tends to go on and on about small irrelevant details and misses some curious questions. A great topic and subject, but this book didnt live up to the expectations for me. For a truly great book of this nature one must see ""A History of Knowledge"" By Charles van Doren. Now that was a stunner!"
5,My favorite book back at last,"Book came exactly as described, used to have a copy that I took all over the world. Lost it in the Philippines, glad to finally have it again. Service was excellent and book in fantastic condition! Will use this vendor again."
1,Rip Off,Although attractive the trivet was the size of a coaster and totally a rip off.I reurned it immediately.
4,Very Pretty Christmas Music,"It is very difficult to find good classical Christmas music,but this CD is lovely! Perfect to relax to after a hectic day of Christmas shopping!"
3,For those wanting a quiet Christmas album,"This is my 5th Christmas cd from Windham Hill. While not my favorite of the five, it still fits the Windham Hill sound and I recommend it for a quiet ""Night before Christmas""."
5,Another great one from the Solstice people,I have all their music collection. I look forward to the winter or should I say the cold. My Decenber cd goes in around Thanksgiving and the others are played up untill Feb. Very tanquil music.
4,Nice looking,I like the way this waatch works but it is complicated to use features. It took me a while to figure out what controls what. If you are looking for an easy use product this is not one of it. I do not understand directions after reading it several times. A little frustrating combination of sequences that you have to do to set the alarm. I like the way it looks and that was a reason I bought it.
4,pretty good,As books go this is very client friendly and I liked that - Helps normalize folks with ADD and ADHD - gives ideas and structure to people with the disorder
3,Makes Simple Tasks seem Very Complicated!,"This is the kind of book most of us with ADD enjoy because it doesn't require us to read through but allows us to jump to the sections that apply to the moment. For that, and the fact there are some great ADD-able recipes, I give it 3 stars. But for anyone looking for a system, or a perspective, or a big-picture, to help their lives flow more easily, this book falls short. This book should be purchased from the bargain-clearance shelf after it's been marked down to under $4.00 or on eBay were others who paid full price are trying to unload them! Only then will you be getting your money's worth."
2,Not worth the cost,The book is just a series of short notes with very simplistic ideas such as buying notebooks/3 ring binders/ folders. All of the info is readily available on-line and for free.
2,Survival Tips for Women with AD/HD,The picture was a little misleading because it looks like there are separators between each subject like a file folder. The book wasn't nearly as informative as most of the books I have read on the subject.
2,Keep Looking,"In the last few years, lots of books about adult ADD have come on the market, and most of them are better than this one. I am embarrassed to admit I bought this book strictly because of its cover - I thought it was a tabbed spiral notebook. As another reviewer mentioned, it's actually a plain paperback. The title was also appealing since I've experimented with nearly every organizational method known to man, including ""piles, palms, and post-its"". I assumed the book would include creative ways to organize, but it was only ""tips"", which are small blurbs that I forgot within five minutes. Search Amazon for ""adult adhd"" and you'll find tons of books on the subject, almost all of them more genuinely useful than this one."
2,Overpriced and false advertisement,"Why do they have a $20,000+ list price in the ad? Totally false advertisement as buying it from Canon USA directly it goes for $9100 (list price). Disappointed in Amazon on this deal trying to make $9800 seem like a good deal."
5,First hand medical account of Dachau,"I knew the author of this book, Marcus Smith, in his later life, when he was a radiologist in Santa Fe, New Mexico. He was a gentle, thoughtful, and open minded physician, and a very good radiologist.I read this book when it first came out, and it opened my eyes to the true horror of the death camps in Germany during the Second World War. The careful description of the camps, the prisoners, and the medical team that first came upon them is stark, moving, and essential to understanding what happened. The newsreel footage conveys only a small piece of what the medical teams found there.The Harrowing of Hell is wellnamed. It's not hard to read, like many books about the Holocaust. We have much more detailed information from other sources, but this book tells the story like no other, on the front lines, in the first person, and as it happened."
1,"Harrowing writing, perhaps","You wouldn't have thought it was possible for a book about such a serious, important subject, to be so bland, but I am afraid the most harrowing thing about reading this is the dull prose of this book, written as if by a school student for a teacher they wanted to impress. There are many better books about the nightmare of Dachau. Don't waste your time on this badly written piece of literature."
4,"Great Book, but not quite a Piece of Cake","Derek Robinson's ""Piece of Cake"" is my favorite novel telling the same story that Frank Barnard revisits with ""Blue Man Falling."" Stories of the Fall of France are not numerous. At first I was a little concerned as there were many similarities between ""Blue Man"" and ""Piece of Cake."" The American pilot in ""Blue Man"" seems very similar to the one in ""Piece of Cake."" As the novel progressed it became clear that this was a different story and it was very enjoyable. Anyone who has read ""Piece of Cake"" should enjoy ""Blue Man."" If I have a complaint it is that I would have liked to get to know the other pilots of the squadron much better. ""Blue Man"" has a secondary plot which means there is not as much time devoted to flying and the lives of the pilots as one might like. Still all in all a very enjoyable book."
2,Flawed book,"The photographs in this book are terrific. Obviously Ward is a gifted photographer. But he (or the publisher) commit the unpardonable sin of not identifying the locations of most of the images. This omission is most disappointing. I recognize certain images as having come from Zion National Park and other locations in the American Southwest, but why should the reader be left guessing? Compounding the sin is a writing style that appears to be trying to be helpful and inciteful but which in fact is devoid of any real content. So, for example, under a stunning photo of a slot canyon, quite possibly Antelope Canyon in Arizona, we find this drivel: ""If an image is abstract or ambiguous, the feelings and meanings we get from this are not all expressible in words."" Certainly he was not able to express in words anything interesting or useful here."
2,Received book in poor condition,I am giving this book as a gift and it was shipped poorly and now embarrassing to give. I am upset with the quality of the book but wish I just went to the bookstore and picked one out that didn't look like it was from a garage sale.
3,could have been better,"When I first saw who was on the album I bought it the first time I saw it. Rappers like Brotha lynch, loki, First degree the de, B legit, Spice 1 and the rest of the siccmade camp are on it. The beats are very original but i was looking for more solo performances. Most of the songs have like two or three or four people on one track. Most of the tracks are decent my favorite one is three the hard way with be gee, loki and Brotha lynch hung If you like the siccmade sound it is a must have. This compilation is better than most of the others."
4,Super cool and super freaky!,"This movie is absolutely crazy! I loved it! It had a moment of boringness :) in the middle somewhere, that's why I gave it 4 stars, but once the tongue started talking it was hilarious! It had so many absurd and freaky things going on! My kind of horror/comedy!"
4,Liberating Tongue,"as it happens with the best majority of exploitation cinema, of which killer tongue is certainly not one of the more violent or offensive examples at all, you should leave your linear expectations somewhere between heaven and hell, let's say round that scorching, toasting, roasting desert where all characters convey to face destiny brought from outerspace by an alien lifeform travelling with a comet which causes anyone exposed to its influence to experience sexual urges, exploding orgasms, self-revelations from the very deep# great SOUNDTRACK by spanish technopopdubmetalambient, definetely modern dynamic duo named FANGORIA"
1,ABOMINABLE,I nearly bought this thing on DVD looking at the reviews given.I rented the video and believe this mess is way below 'Street Trash'. The recommendation for its 'black humor' is not true. There is no 'black humor'.There is only 'sick' exploitation.If you have to see this thing rent it.Don't waste your money on a purchase.
4,Freaky flick,LOL The killer tongue I liked the movie especially the tongue he was funny and I a into these freaky like movies and the title really says it all Killer tongue and its a really good movie the killer tongue is a nice freaky flick the story could've have been better but what can you expect with a title like that
3,Bizarre beyond belief,"Although all the other reviews of this title are fair and honest, nothing anyone can say will prepare you for the bizarre-o fest that is ""Killer Tongue."" A worthy companion to ""Brain Damage"" and ""Basket Case.""Fair warning to those who care about such things...the video transfer on this DVD is simply awful. It's clearly an old recycled VHS transfer with nothing done to clean it up. Scene composition is severely compromised and the image is fuzzy and soft throughout. Sound is OK, but no better than VHS Hi-Fi. There are absolutely NO extras beyond a handful of trailers for other films also available from Ardustry. In short, this DVD issue is sadly lacking, but if you're a fan of the flick it will probably do just fine until something better comes along (if ever)."
3,I'M A TONGUE. WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO?,"This is a comedy-cult horror that misses on all cylinders. A space meteor/alien lands in soup as ""boring as nuns"" that is ingested by a woman (Melinda Clarke). She is taken over by an alien tongue and her 4 pet poodles are turned into flaming homosexuals (I didn't write this.). She is awaiting her boyfriend to get out of a Mexican prison, where Robert Englund appears to be the only guard. The movie lacks in horror. The dialouge is bad and lacks the humor and style needed to create a cult plot.F-bomb, adult situations, no nudity"
4,Info about the DVD.,"I will not talk about the film itself, I rate it 4/5 coz I really like it, and understand that it's not for all tastes. But this DVD doesn't do justice to the movie. The transfer is terrible, dark, bad audio and worst of all pan & scanned wich crop the good compositions of many shots (it was shot at 1.85) and render the movie properly unwatchable. Half of the faces are missing during close ups and I don't talk about the beautiful desert landscape. I suggest you buy the spanish DVD wich have respected format, Eng audio track and you'll be abble to fully appreciate this film. If the reviewers that didn't like it have seen this version it doesn't help their judgement for sure."
1,Pure Trash.,"I once got a free Laserdisc of that film and I'll have to advise you not to buy this pile of rubbish. If you think this might be interesting because of Englund or Mindy Clark, forget it! This so called ""movie"" tries to be a prison drama, monster film and ""Priscilla, Queen of The Desert"" all rolled into one. Needless to say, it doesn't work - it's neither funny nor scary, just incredibly boring..."
1,OK if you just want a Slushy,"This item does not chop, it just makes everything into soup. AsSeenOnTV was very rude and unprofessional. Save yourself the time and money."
3,Nothing compared to CC!,"CC, otherwise known as Custom Content, is very popular for Sims 2. Third parties create hair, furniture, etc., and this content is usually free. This game is a big flop compared to CC. Instead of buying this, I would reccomend you going to a safe and free CC site where you could get anything you want, saving your money for more Sims games or whatnot. I did rate this three stars because this is a nice installment if you don't trust or use CC. This is probally the best SP on the Sims 2 right now, also. This game has no glitches I can see, and arrived a few days early, which made me happy."
3,Glamour Stuff,"Well, as a long time Simmer, this add on was definately better than the family fun stuff edition. That said, there were not enough items, and the cost of the edition was too much for the contents. The fansites have wonderful downloads for the Sims 2 and I am a dedicated fan of the fansites themselves. The fur-coats and the furniture were the most impressive for me in this add-on. I also enjoyed the new wallpapers and floors as well. All in all this is a good edition, especially to those of us who don't download off the fansites. Here's hoping they do an add-on for Pets....come on people, give me more toys for my kitty cat! Happy Simming!"
3,Excellent clothes in full dress,"The clothes of the men are very elegant, whereas the clothes of the children are little. With respect to the feminine clothes, they are too sensual and had to bring objects that adapted to the type of social life that settles down in the game."
2,Overpriced and Not Very Worth It,"You get a few outfits and some new furniture but not a lot. With all of the free stuff out there to download for The Sims, the Stuff Pack is not very worth it. Maxi is just milking the franchise for every penny."
3,Not bad for a stuff pack,"EA stuff packs tend to be over-priced. This one does have some nice clothing and furniture meshes. It's worth getting, but better if you can get it on sale."
3,Cool items but ....,"I liked the items that were added to my Sims 2 from this 'Glamour Life Stuff' but, as many reviewers mentioned what you see on the cover of this 'expansion' is basically the only new items your Sims will get. Overall, some nice items here, but not worth the money in my opinion."
3,"too little, too much","Not enough items for the price. The furniture is spectacular, but then again, it is not enough especially if you're a die hard decorator like me. If you don't download objects/items at all from the web, get a used copy of this so the price is semi-fair."
1,To expensive...... not worth it......... don't buy it,"When I first looked at this game I thought it would be a cool glamour stuff pack for my sims. It would have all the cool clothes and stuff that i loved from the sims superstar expansion pack. (I didn't expect the whole Studio town just the clothes, well more and better ones, and the really cool item like the Aquarium. EA and Maxis should make something like that for the Sims 2"
2,not the best add on,just a few extra things no big deal if you get it on sale then sure go get it lol
1,Where are the items,"I noticed there were not many new items in this game, I found this the advertising for this game to be deceiving. This expansion ws not worth the money."
2,Love Sims2 & Expansions - This Stuff Ain't Worth It,"I love playing Sims2 once in a while, and the expansions are usually a lot of fun. However, the Glamour Life Stuff & other *Stuff* add ons are just not worth the money. You basically just get a few new styles of furniture & clothes, but nothing that makes gameplay any better or different. Perhaps if they put these out at $10 or less with 2 - 3 times the choices, it may be a more worthwhile purchase."
5,Wonderful Addition To The Sims 2!,"The Glamour Life expansion pack is just a treat! This ""stuff"" pack is a great add-on, especially for those of us that are too skeptical to download items from the web. The pack comes with great furniture and clothing options that are inspired from the (in my opinion) greatest era ever for furniture; Art Deco! One thing too keep in mind is that while most of the wall coverings are lovley there are some very hideous ones too. The last thing is that if modern style isn't your taste (for you or your sims alike) then I wouldn' reccomend this to you, but I love it!"
3,Decent Expansion Pack,"This was a decent expansion pack, not one of my favorites overall for the Sims 2, but still worth the cost."
5,Sims is so fun,My daughter who is 23 loves the Sims games. She has to have them as soon as they come out. She and her aunt talk about it and share ideas.(so there's not an age limit)
3,Nice additions to the game,"Even if you download a lot of custom content, this still has some nice things."
4,*A Exhilarating Book*,"The book I read was Teetoncey. It won eighteen books for young people`s award. The author is Theodore Taylor.I liked this book a lot ! I give book a 4 stars. I think this book is exhilarating beacause it is surprising and you don`t know what going to happen`s next . It has an exicting ending . I can connect to this story beacause the named Ben O`Neal was very brave and I am brave too. This story is about a brave boy searches in the darkness for signs of suvivors. I recommend this book to anyone who likes an exhilarating,don`t know what`s going to happen next book! Pick up this book now!!!"
4,Know more,"I've recently completed the audio book of The Creators, from Books on Tape. The 747 pages of copy takes a little over 40 hours to hear. Boorstin's work, while not exhaustive, provides a relatively easy way to become acquainted with much of the art, especially Western art, of mankind. Even anyone steeped in history will find something new in this work, something that may have escaped notice in other efforts. While some regard history as a dry rehearsal of facts, Boorstin seems to put things into a perspective of freshness, one in which a reader can walk anew in the steps of those grand figures of years past. There may be no practical value in knowing all these things but knowing will add to a person's appreciation for things, like music, painting, literature and the rest. This effort, like the others from Boorstin's pen, is worthwhile and will long benefit the reading public."
5,The Creators/a History of Heroes of the Imagination,"Need a crash course in world civilization? Boorstin delivers awonderful message of over 10,000 years of human accomplishments. Hisdetail of the human experience is direct and uncomplicated. ""TheCreators"" is the first in a masterfully done trilogy, which in addition includes ""The Discovers"" and the ""The Seekers"". Boorstin enables us to enjoy a detailed overview of the current civilization occupying the third planet from the sun."
4,If only there were more fire,"Boorstin is well- intentioned, serious, tremendously knowledgable. He knows how to choose interesting topics for his work. A history of the heroes of the imagination sounds extremely interesting. The problem is that Boorstin writes with a dry flatness perhaps better suited to chronicling minor inventions of Americans changing everyday life, than great geniuses. I truly looked forward to this work but read it with a certain disappointment. And this when I admire Boorstin and know him to be one of the finest American historians."
3,Boorstin's shallow narrative on the history of 'the creator',"I found 'The creators', as a narrative piece, to lack the in-depth analytical reasoning that the subject demands. Boorstin builds a mosaic of his subject from specific characters and creative 'advances' throughout history, and whilst he succeeds in opening the door to a piecemeal understanding of creative progression, we do not gain insight into the ebb and flow of creativity from one era to the next. In effect, we are viewing the outcomes rather than the underlying driving forces behind creativity. I enjoyed this book for its short and succinct precis on individual heroes and their life's work, but ultimately yearned to know more about the zeitgeist from which they sprang - or ultimately created."
1,The Creators,"I have not received the products that I ordered on 6/8/2012 - I am in the process of contacting the seller, who is not responding or replying to my email attempts. I would say at this time, I am very dissatisfied with the seller and would suggest to others to never order from them. The seller is nangsuer - I would highly recommend to avoid this seller!!!!"
3,"A Useful Overview of ""Great Western Art"" But Nothing New","This unfortunately myopic and ""catholic"" work offers a readable overview of many of the great artists of Europe (and a smattering located elsewhere). But the treatment of non-European traditions demonstrates a series of basic misunderstandings regarding the cultures the author (nearly) explains-away. (For example: No creation story in Vedic Cosmology? Please.) And, unfortunately, when dealing with European art, there are few analyses that set this work apart from, say, a long string Cliff's Notes or the articles one would find in a decent encyclopedia.That said, if you have no idea who Leonardo was, or want to learn the basic structure of the Canterbury Tales, this book will help. Beyond that, I find the themes which unite the author's ""summaries"" insulting -- or banal, at best."
5,Canon 500mm lens,I bought this lens fronm B&H; Photo Video. The service is excellent and the lens is awesome. The best lens for nature and sports photography. Un paralleled in image quality.Sandeep.
3,A Noteworthy book,"A Savage Parade is not without its merits: There are some intense scenes that seem taken out of a movie and interesting phrases that I think were meant to boggle readers instead of entertaine them. As an ordinary reader I found that the historical parts of the story were beyond me. When I buy a work of fiction I don't want to read about ancient histories and philosophies. The way these things work themselves into the story line are also hard to make out. At the end I was left saying ""Huh? What did I miss?"" I recommend than you don't read this book on the train or on the way to work. It's too far fetched for understanding at some points. When it does make sense I couldn't really relate to it. The interesting parts were when the author got down to the basics of writing and told a story. He does this very seldomly though throughout the book."
2,A Review,"""A savage Parade"" is at times complex and the stoty line become extremely convoluted and unbelievable. Murray-Miller's use of imagery is unique, showing that as a writer he does have talent. However, over all the story does not come together very efficiently and can drag on. It appears that the author intends this book to be experiment in prose, imagery, and diction and sometimes the work can very touching (especially during certain family scenes) but despondency, nihilism, a decadence comes through with a louder voice in the writing, undermining any uplifting feeling the reader gets. The last two chapters are the best in the book but are removed from the story line themselves. This is a writer to watch for in the future but his first work seems to lack any feeling of harmony, good nature or cohesiveness."
3,Fiction or History?,"Murray-Miller works with fiction in a pecular way, creating an odd image- a modern world super-imposed over an ancinet and decaying one. This author shows promise, however his influences are too blatant; Joyce, Rimbaud, Faulkner, Kerouac. It is entertaining and keeps you reading due to the rich treatment of human psychology. However, There are certain elemnts which prove a bit controversial, such as rape, murder, and his outlook towards women. The last two chapters are Amazing, by that I mean well written and beautifuly crafted fiction. They make up for the rather wordy first 100 or so pages."
2,works with a problem,"The battery cover causes an open battery compartment error every time I move or touch the PDA. I emailed and got a second battery cover and it does the same thing. I was told to fold some paper and put it between the battery and the door. This did help a little, but I didn't think it was a very professional fix for a brand new item."
1,lying battery,first of all i am not happy with the purchace of this product yeah it was a reasonable price but you get what you pay for this battery charged once and now my dell wont even turn on.
4,"Good service, wrong description","Battery arrived on time, with proper tracking information and all. Works great in my Axim x51, too. However, as one reviewer has already noticed, the battery is 2250mAh, not 2400, as tech. specs on the site say."
3,nothing is made in hong kong,"Everything that says its made in Hongkong isn't. They ship it there, it gets a made in hk sticker and ships right back out."
4,Fun historical fiction,"A unique approach to a very interesting subject - I was intrigued by the humane depiction of the practices that seem so barbaric to us today and insight on what motivated that civilization. The past/present views of the geography and culture were not only entertaining, but have inspired me to visit the ruins of Palenque with a more animated perception of its rich history."
2,don't bother,"ms criscenzo should write of travels in mexico only, and leave the romantic fiction to others."
3,Celtic or Not-Celtic,"I can not agree more with Christina Roden.There are many compilation discs with a title to be filed under ""Celtic"".A lot of them, this one included, are false.I also agree with another reviewer that another Clannad song should have been selected (plenty of choice).David Arkenstone and Vangelis don't belong here. Not because of the quality of both songs. It's just a matter of classification into another genre. Chris Spheeris' superb music also doesn't belong on a Celtic sampler. And the wonderous music made by musical landscape painter Gandalf (Heinz Strobl) likewise.Greetings,Ron de Wolf, The Netherlands"
3,Mystical Circles would be a better title,"This is great music, however, the use of Celtic is far from being a description. I agree with another reviewer who felt the title might be more appropriate with Mystical Circles. The introduction to the CDs written by Gerry Wetzel shows he doesn't know much about what's Celtic. Uilleann pipes and bodhran are both misspelled for heaven's sake!"
3,Too much Singing,"It was an ok combination, though who wanted singing? not i said the fly, take out some of the songs like Factory Girl (irritated me a bit) and put in more howard shore and leeh types and ill be goodDanke"
2,Ya Call this Celtic,To lunp this with songs about Irish strugles is terrible. If it was under New Age it would be an ok cd set.Enya is NOT celtic by the way.
4,Wonderful blend of traditional and new age Celtic.,"The Celtic Circle is a wonderful blend of traditional Celtic melodies and Celtic inspired new age. Disk 1 is by far my favorite with songs from undisputed celtic masters: Loreena McKennitt, The Chieftans and Clannad. The other songs on the first disk fill in and compliment each other. It's a great choice to put in the CD player and hit ""Play"". I challenge anyone listen to ""The Shores of the Swilly"" or ""Angel"" and not be moved by the lyrics and music.Disk 2 isn't bad by any stretch of the imagination either."
3,"Great recording, but this one is not original!","Excellente Album by Pink Floyd, one of the best they ever recorded! Just some few words, this is not an official cd, it has two in one, including early singles from the sixties, I bought it two years ago, but it is simply a Russian fake copy with average quality. Even the cover art is different than the one that appears here, it has the robot handshaking over a black background with the indication "" Limited Edition"" which I investigated never was done. They copied for the cd the art from the Shine on box,( which was exclusive for it) and put in the disc the music of two cds from that box,that's all. Don't believe what the seller says, he is maybe not aware about this being a copy, but very possibly he is!"
2,Come Ye Thankful People Come,"As one who was brought up surrounded by beautiful choral music I was very disappointed with the mediocrity of this choral group. I wondered whey they even bothered publishing this and actually sold it to the general public. Although I as very taken with the seasonal choices of the music, I was not at all moved when I actually heard the muusic presented by a not overly talented group. I don't doubt their enthusiasm and committment - I just think they should have kept it for their local community. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!"
3,Good Memories!,"As long as I can remember, two of my favorite Thanksgiving songs have been ""Come Ye Thankful People Come"" and ""We Gather Together.""I'm glad that I found them both on this CD. The singers are not the Mormon Tabernacle Choir--nor do they pretend to be. Nonetheless, the humility and sincerity of the voices shine through, and I am enjoying once again these songs from my early school days."
2,Everybody deserves at least one try,"Every big-name conductor gets a try at the Beethoven Ninth, and some, like Charles Munch, Solti, and Andre Previn on this CD, come up very, very short. Previn is bland to the point of incredulity in the first movement, whose slackness couldn't be greater. The same holds true for the sublime Adagio, which here comes off as a limp series of phrases with no conneciton. The Scherzo proceeds proficienlty enough, and the vocal quartet, recruited from the Met despite the London locale of the recording, are fine. but the conducting remains sluggish to the end. The sonics from 1988 are resonant but otherwise natural. Anyway, why bother with details when the conductor is at such a loss?"
2,More of Previn's weak Beethoven,"This is a pretty listless performance. I've now heard all of Previn's Beethoven recordings. Not much life except in the 5th and some of the overtures. As far as the 9th, this probably doesn't rank in the top 50 available recordings. Look elsewhere."
1,Always Persian Gulf,"Never forget that name of this gulf is PERSIAN GULF, since 7000 years ago and always will be with this name!!!Correct your Title."
3,Err..,"Pros:~ Lightens the darkest hair.~ Works on dyed hair.Cons:~ Doesn't turn your hair white, just gold.~ Interferes with your hair color.(Ex. Add blue, it turns green. >_<)"
5,GREAT PRODUCT!,This is the first time I bleached my hair & I decided on Punky. Let me tell you this stuff is great! They have just gotten a lifelong customer!I was worried I would get sick from the ammonia BUT! You can hardly smell it! There are many other bleaches out there that stink up your whole bathroom NOT PUNKY!How do I know this? My mother has tried to bleach her hair numerous times with store bought bleach and afterwards I couldn't go in the bathroom!So if you don't want to DIE from ammonia inhalation get PUNKY!
1,The worst instructional video,If there were a rating below one star I would use it. The video claims to show sailing technique and offer advice from a famous sailor. The entire video was filmed at the dock. The sail trim features were useless and non-descrptive.One example is upwind jib trim. The boat is facing downwind at the dock and they hold the sail out to give it shape.I have returned the video. -T
4,Walking into the night,This book was a good read and I learned a lot about Iceland and the Hearsts.. I have enjoyed all of the books I have read by this author..
5,The Bookschlepper Recommends,"Since reading the author's brilliant The Journey Home, I've wanted to read more from him; this was no disappointment. Again we have an unapologetic person examining long-ago decisions. Christian is not a likeable man; he has left his wife and children in Iceland and come to the US for the love of an exotic dancer, an equally unlikeable character. Left alone, he finds his solace at San Simeon, running the estate of another unlikeable character: William Randolph Hearst. With no one around to win Ms/Mr Congeniality, Olafsson pins his story on connecting the threads between past and present while juxtaposing two men of similar self-interest, whether they are building a business, jettisoning a family, or blind to all but a woman. Of course, if one has money, one is merely eccentric; without funds, one is an outcast."
3,The irony of the reviews,"Though I have not read this book, I am intrigued by the reviews. The irony of the comments by southpaw68 and JKM is that their own reviews are riddled with grammatical errors and runon sentences. Those who live in glass houses................"
4,Bravo,"This book is in fact reality staring us in the face. So many of us want to sweep this stuff under the rug & not deal with it. Then who is left to clean up this mess the sickos are making? Johnny's mother certainly deserves all the support we can give her - how many mothers have had a similar incident and stuck their heads in the sand? Not Noreen Gosch, she is a trooper and a brave one I must say. Not only is she a trooper but a trailblazer. The story is unbelievable to some people but it has to be true for her to put her heart into such depth of our society. Some of the things she has uncovered should make the headlines! I applaud her."
4,"subtle, laconic fantasy","Quite enjoyable. Lynn's laconic style of writing is a welcome change from the more popular self-conscious and overwritten kind of fantasy. This is a very subtle story of love, and revenge. Recommended."
1,Unimpressive,"This starts out ok, but doesn't fufill the promise of the first few chapters. The flow of the narrative is so uneven that there are several places where it almost seems as if the publisher accidently left out several paragraphs. Read McKillip, Kerr, LeGuin, or McKinley if you want to read good fantasy by a female author. Especially read Monette if you're interested in fantasy with gay/lesbian themes."
1,Stilted and Choppy,"While this book is certainly a far cry from 'traditional' when compared to most fantasy novels, the stilted and extremely choppy writing style, along with the rambling plot left me clueless as to how it could have possibly won the World Fantasy Award. There are far better books out there."
1,Terrible writing style,"Several things bother me here. The writing in general seemed disorganized and choppy. I've read many books, and this one stands out by far as having one of the worst writing styles. The author puts so many mundane details in a paragraph it seemed like she was just trying to fill up some pages. She also seemed to be jumping from one thought to another without much logical progression. Maybe it's just my preference of styles, but I just don't know how this book got published."
2,"sorry, had to drop it.","I just couldn't finish reading this book. When I had read half of it and I still didn`t see where the point of the story was, I had to quit. I did not care about the characters (in fact I knew little about them, they are so sketchy)and the scenery was so dull and lacking in detail that it was impossible to be conjured by imagination.In fact, up to the point in mid-story where I dropped it, the whole story seems aimless and without a real sense of an obvious conflict that has to be resolved. As for the writing style, the sentences ar too short, which makes the rythm artificial and strained. Really, I can't see why this novel got the world fantasy award."
4,More than meets the eye...,"I picked up this book in the bookstore while waiting to meet afriend. I was immediately engaged in the story -- it beginsdramatically -- but did not expect to find the book so unusually thought-provoking. Lynn's plot contains a number of the standard fantasy elements: a prince in exile, a loyal retainer, an enemy usurper, and an idyllic valley. But there is much more to this tale than first meets the eye. The author has woven her story with many subtle issues and unusual themes. The book is not particularly fast-moving, but then, one does not wish it to be. The slower pace gives the reader time to absorb the complex personalities of the characters and to explore the familiar but strange imaginary landscape. I look forward to reading the second two books of the trilogy and recommend this book to any reader interested in well crafted fantasy."
3,Definitely unique but still not great,"This book is pretty directionless from the start. You don't like or dislike the main characters, you don't like or dislike the enemies. Everyone is a typical person, which is certainly interesting, but also makes the book very difficult to really get into. The end comes, and leaves you unaffected, because you don't especially care what happens to anyone. Strangely, it's the book's very blandness that makes it worth reading. This isn't your average fantasy book. There's no beautiful princess, fantastic battle scene, superbly evil enemy... There are just a bunch of people going through the steps. It's neither boring nor engaging. It's just several events strung together, mundane as the real world but in a fantasy setting. Very different."
2,"Interesting, but not outstanding","I picked up this book because it had won the World Fantasy Award, and for the life of me I can't figure out why. The characters are bland, and the story seems a bit pointless. There's almost no excitement or drama, and the end is a let down. Still, the author does attempt to offer something more than the typical quest fare, and for that alone it's interesting. If you're looking for something serious, give it a try. Just don't expect too much from it."
4,"Brilliant, Informative - a fine supplement!","This is really a brilliant book. It has everything you need to know about jazz from basic to advanced. No matter if you are a student, dancer or teacher.A.Gaarden,dancer,teacher& choreographer"
4,excellent scholarship on a rather specialized topic,"The thought that somebody could write a 300 page book only about Blue in Old English may strike some people as rather weird. In fact, the study of Colour terms in different languages is rather fascinating. Biggam an provides excellent reconstruction of the OE colour system and also disproves some myths about OE colour. Thus, although the book IS on a rather specialzed topic it can be recommended for those interested in colour and language."
2,DON'T Buy this if your trying to hook up an xbox to a monitor!!!,"This product gives out analog signal not digital and the monitor can only sense digital, altho this will work if your trying to hook up to a projector"
2,Disappointing,"As one who is a great fan of Betty MacDonald's, I had hoped that this book would provide details beyond those in Betty's own books. It proved very disappointing. Blanche writes mostly of her own (very ordinary) life, adding a brief reference to, or funny line uttered by, Betty and family here and there. Only the first chapter, which refers to when Betty and Blanche were teens, has even a ""full length anecdote."" Sections that seem promising (for example, Blanche's mentioning she was eager to see Betty after her marriage for details about the meeting and courtship) lead to no further information. There are several photographs of Betty and one of her sister Mary, but none of any other family members. Don't purchase this one second hand for more than 50 cents."
3,"Its not THAT bad, but...","These are the cutest cages. However, they are very hard to take apart, and even harder to clean. The plastic pieces break easily, and the door does become loose so a smart hammy will figure its way out. I have 12 hammys, and only 3 of this type of cage. Great for the kids, but really kind of a headache for the caretakers. Consider a wire cage. Its great fun to watch the hammy's crawl all over the ceiling and do push-ups from time to time."
2,Breaks and hamster can escape,"This cage is not great. We have had it for about a month and already the plastic tabs that fasten the top have broken off and the hamster has figured out how to open the door and get out. Also, I purchased some expansion kits which I cannot connect to this and there are no directions! Avoid this habitat."
3,Good but not what I expected,"The first book I read from Alan was 'I had it all the time' which is about one of the best book I've ever read. This books doesn't bring anything new beside a business theme in a fictional story to cover ideas he already shared in his previous books. If you have read books from Alan before, save your money. If you haven't and need a booster for your financial life, get this book. Otherwise, I think Alan has written better books for the price with more content."
3,Almost,Original from Author with writing words thoughts.Elements of USA told in a story format for the curious and wantabe authors but the 2002 authors edition wraps revises and takes this book and the other book and makes a complete circle.The two book edited version is worth five stars. Author covers everything from education through politics with messages has good eye for detail.
3,Good But Waiting on the Masterpiece,"Unedited (some quirky stuff and long sentences) but shortened version from author (in own words)'bout relationship that develops between former elem teacher (black, fortyish, Albany State grad)and white-thirtyish-slightly disabled-computer genius (Michigan State grad)who she starts working for (Florida). The book is good in that there's holiday stuff, money, sports, and heavy eduation theme but edited version (can't wait!!) coming out. And told the two main characters do more than ""handshake"" in the revised one. ""The Bonus and Sister Planet Tara: The Complete Stories-Edited"" by same author s'pose to be out by end of September 2002 with reason behind this unedited unpublicized edition first and both interracial stories in one book."
4,70s Delillo forshadows his current visionary brilliance,"GREAT JONES STREET is a novel set in the 70's that is as relevant now as when it was first published. The main character - an AWOL rock musician - with shades of Dylan or Lennon attempts to escape the life of celebrity only to find his disappearing act, in mid tour, has made him that much more an enigma, raising the torch of his celebrity. With the much publicized saga of the late Kurt Cobain, an artist drained by commerce and ultimately destroyed by it, GREAT JONES STREET forshadows the struggle of artists within the system of commerce and capitalism of the United States. It is a novel about fame, and commerce, and the rights of the individual in society whether they be famous or not. It doesn't have the taught language of UNDERWORLD or the magnificent LIBRA but it is worth the time. A definite precursor to the grand themes of LIBRA, Delillo's finest novel."
2,dated and best-forgotten,"The low-point in the great man's career, the book shows little feel for rock and roll and its hippy messiah of a protagonist is almost as embarrassing as Jim Morrison himself was. The lyrics are especially awful and the whole thing seems dated - like most genuine late 60s / early 70s rock. De Lillo went on to much, much greater things, which is what you should read instead."
4,This music was and is ahead of its time!,"This album is cool. Sounds like a bunch of stoned hippy punks getting together for a real head-trip of a musical experience. Check out ""Crazy for your love"" ""Stet"" ""Punk of Today"" and of course the glorious ""Heat's Risin / Jehovah's Witness"" Your life will never be the same..."
5,Comes with the video on the cd.,"Excellent stuff! This is the kind of music that just makes you wanna dance dance dance. 4 tracks. 1.Original - very good. 2.Chili con carne mix - not bad. 3.Dyrt mix - excellent (especially if you want to mix this with other tracks). 4.Live track, this is a great track recorded live.I really enjoyed this CD and plan to put it on a list with a few others to make a killer disco funk cd! Get it now!"
2,NOT the answer - save your money,"Lawlis is a doctor of psychology, not MD. He has no credentials to base many of his claims on. The research sources he cites are old and otherwise available; his personal ""research"" is undocumented, unpublished, and anecdotal. Many of his statements are outright wrong. He is making an effort to jump on the new age bandwagon without any substance to his ""facts"". This cure-all book is a farce and will further disappoint many families that try to use it. Love your kids, help them, explore treatments - that's the only value this book has. And now I just told you."
3,Tantrums gone with EFAs,"My son had been diagnosed with ADD by psychiatry in kindergarten. BUT his terrible tantrums from age 1 to 8, (throwing himself on the floor, banging his head, screaming, hitting, demolishing his room) have stopped since he took Essential FAtty Acids. The teacher literally had all good things to say about him a month after he started taking these nutrition supplements. Where he couldn't get up in time for school at 9:00 am, he could now get up at 7 for a shower. Our family no longer had to walk on egg shells around him, he was more predicable and fell asleep at a good time every night. He could organize his world to the point that he finished whole projects thoroughly and thoughtfully on his own in grade 5 and 6. This solution came to our family through prayer and this was God's answer I believe. I hope you find your answer."
1,Blah,"Wow, no only does this book give false information, it has an underlying sentiment that somehow people with ADHD are bringing it on themselves. Setting some goals, eat your veggies, got to be early and everything will be fine. It's about as usefull as telling someone who is depressed to 'cheer up'!If your into alternative therapy or so desperate and willing to drop money at any technique that hasn't been proven- buy this book. However, if your interested in the REAL treatments of ADHD, try a doctor that specializes in it. A doctor can suggest real treatments such as cognative and behavior modification therapy and medication.Ah, and speaking about medication, Ritalin is a STIMULANT. It doesn't turn kids into ZOMBIES. A little logic would prove that to be counterproductive. Being zonked out would make the kid even LESS attentive."
2,ADD is a designer disease,"ADD is a designer disease concocted to sell Ritalin, which is a drug in search of a disease. The ""epidemic"" of ADD should be a clue; in my city, one class of 33 students has 28 of them on Ritalin. The list of ""symptoms"" is suspect; the fact that you have ""symptoms"" is also a symptom, and this ""disease"" is routinely diagnosed by nurses, teachers, principals and school counselors with no real qualifications. The good thing about this book is that it DOES give treatment alternatives such as natural remedies, biofeedback and behavior modification (Which is the only remedy really needed anyway) as an alternative to drugs. Still, I'm terribly disappointed in Dr. Phil this time. Two stars because it does recommend other treatments than drugging children silly."
1,Baseless anecdotes that hypothesize everything,"If this book was ever submitted as a review for publication, her book would never, ever, be submitted for publication. It's because her writing is simply unscientific. SSRI's are used by over ten million people, and she collected a few hundred stories of side effects. Wow, I'm so impressed. And to compare them to LSD is ridiculous. Also to suggest that Prozac turning people gay or ""making"" them into hippies is very politically incorrect, because she suggests that those two social groups are inferior. If you want unscientific anecdotes, but this book. If you want real data on mental illness, buy The Failures of American Medicine."
4,Don't be fooled by the short term effects of these drugs,"My sister was on Prozac for 5 years and it helped her tremendously. But then she found that it wasn't working quite as well as it did. She went to her general practioner (not a therapist or a psychiatrist) and he recommended that she increase the dosage. She did and it made her really edgy. She felt like she wanted to literally crawl out of her skin. Her doctor switched her to Paxil. Less than 30 days later, she shot and killed her husband. These drugs may start out helping people, but in some the results are dangerous. Make sure that you are receiving regular treatment from a therapist or psychiatrist while you are taking these drugs. You should not just take them without being monitored."
4,ALWAYS A PLEASER!!,"I am never disappointed when reading a Michael Palmer. I think the man could scribble on tree bark and I'd be happy.As always, the storyline is believable and easy to follow.Definitely worth the time to read!!"
3,"Not terrible, but...","This book differed quite a bit from the rest of Michael Palmer's books. While most of the books I've read by Palmer deal mainly with hospital life, this book focused a lot of hospital politics. The book itself was good, but not one of his better books. The ending of the book dropped off very quickly and left me wondering and guessing what happened. If you're a Palmer fan, read it. Otherwise, try another of his books."
5,Great book,"Michael Palmer is one of by favorite writers and recommend his books. The book was in great condition, received sooner than expected and the price was very good."
4,Flash Back,I like most of Michael Palmer books I have not read one I did not like. I like that they start of fast
3,Fishy words...,"Ichthyic is taken from the Greek word for fish. It is of or pertaining to a fish. ""An ichthyic handshake"" would at my best guess, be a handshake that feels kinda like you're shaking a fish *pleasant thought....yeesh*.I've been reading this book the last few days, and I'm in the middle of it right now. Is it just me, or does the climax happen in the middle, rather than at the end? It just feels as if they reached the climax and then dropped off plot-wise."
3,Spelling???,"What in the world is ichthyic shake? As in ""The surgeon stood and gave Frank's proffered hand an ichthyic shake"". As an avid reader, I have never encountered this word before. Please let me know so that I will be prepared if one is ever offered to me. As for the book itself, it was a little hard to get into in the beginning (of course I bought it to read on a transatlantic flight) so that may have something to do with it."
2,Not What I Expected,This was the first Michael Palmer book I have read. I was dissapointed. This story was more about hospital political issues rather than a little boy who's life was miserable due to sugery. The main idea was more focused on the top people of this hospital and doctor's rather than Toby and his terrible experience. The ending did not give enough detail as to the outcome of Toby and Suzanne. I thought Palmer did a great job on the character's. This book was not what I thought I was going to read about. Hospital politics is for the birds.
4,Fast paced novel,"Flashback was a really good book, but it didn't have what his other books had. I still say it's a really good piece of reading material."
4,Riveting melodrama,"It took me about 15 minutes to get really comfortable with the subtitles but after that they didn't seem intrusive at all. The story is a classic melodrama, and the music/dancing scenes are amazing. I loved the movie."
3,A fast paced adventure.,"Harry Manning ekes out a living by chartering his beloved boat, the Grace Abounding, to wealthy tourists visiting the Bahamas. When Cuban terrorists blow a plane out of the sky with his girlfriend on board, he's left with only one thought...revenge.Passage by Night is a straightforward action-adventure novel which takes place in the days following the Cuban missile crisis. Manning goes from one harrowing situation to the next, escaping by the skin of his teeth each time.This book is fast paced and action packed, but the plotting lacks realism and the characters are unnuanced. More guilty pleasure than award winning literature, Passage by Night rates 3 stars, no more no less."
5,The video quality is great,I was able to download the movie and share it. The quality of the video and sound is truly High Definition. I would suggest purchasing all videos HD
2,UNBELIEVABLY HORRIBLE PACKAGING,I don't write reviews at all but this item deserved it. The price I paid for this item did not come to its worth in packaging. The wrapping was ripping and marked with black sharpie all over. The item also didn't have any plastic wrapping and it was a used one just sold to me. I HATE THIS COMPANY!!!!
3,Downhill,"South Park has really gone downhill. Somewhere along the line (about season 4 or 5,) the boys of South Park became ""the voice of reason."" They're no longer hilariously naive and immature, now they're cynical, sarcastic, and somehow seem to know everything about everything. Cartman used to be a rude, crude, insecure bully, whose funniest antics arose from him getting ""pissed off."" Now, he's just a freaky sociopath that just does evil stuff and is no longer emotionally vulnerable. *Snore*I still give this season three stars because, hey, it's South Park. Yet it's just another less-than-funny installment in the rapidly dwindling series."
1,Ordered 12/6/08 haven't gotten it,bought this as an xmas gift for my brother-in-law on 12/6/08. The date is now 1/10/09 and he has yet to receive it. Thanks for making me look like an inconsiderate sister.
5,Wow...,"In their NINTH SEASON, this show is still near its peak!! That is amazing to me. I gave this season 5 stars because out of its 14 episodes, only a few of them aren't hilarious. And even those have their moments! So overall, I'd say this is my second favorite season (thought the way season 11 has begun, season 9 may get shifted down one in my rankings!). You won't regret buying this unless you just don't like South Park at all."
5,Season 9 is finally out of the closet.....,"This is hella cool, I am so glad to finally have it. They just keep getting better and better. If you're a Southparketeer, you've got to get season 9!"
1,POOR Fitting!!,Usually I prefer OEM parts. But this light was very reasonably priced so I figured I'd try it. To my disappointment.This product is a poor immitation. The body line profile was not correct so it does not fit . My original lense was only cracked and the lense cover was coming apart. So its not like I have a bad bed side. I did leave this assembly on my truck for the time being. But it will be replaced with an OEM. Would not recommend any use this product.
1,Flawed System,"When my tail light was broken I patched it with florescent tape but unfortunately it could not pass inspection like that. I ordered this assembly with Amazon saying, ""This will fit your 2002 dodge ram 1500"". Of course it did not fit at all and I will be returning it."
1,Would not rebuy this book,Normally I don't leave bad reviews on a book. However I was disappointed enough with this book that it warranted a bad review.The Cons:The book is paper thin. There isn't even an introduction to tapping and the style itself. A little more background and talk of the technique itself would be very useful.If you don't know how to do some tapping already this book won't teach you. It assumes you know how to tap and can expand on what you know.The Pros:The CD is good qualityThere are some progressive tapping licks in here that sound pretty hip.Honestly if you know how to tap and want a book to give you some more ideas then it's probably worth the money. If however you are knew to tapping then I'd look else where.
4,It's hypnotizing!,"I believe it really caught my attention. As soon as I started reading I was taken into another world, I couldn't put the book down, I ACTUALLY FELL IN LOVE WITH THE MAIN CHARACTER !!!"
2,"Lots recipes, but disapointing","I was very disappointed with the recipes in this book, the base of each recipe was almost identical, in other word there were only a couple methods of cooking the wings, which was used in each recipe. Only slight variations were used. Nothing unique about this book or the recipes, wish I knew of an alternative, I was hoping to find a better or more alternatives to cooking wings. Complete waste of money."
2,Not the best book I ever bought,"I wasn't real impressed. It's has some redeeming qualities and if you get it used or on sale it could be worth having. ""Wings Across America"" hardly. I would have taken the trip a little more seriously. I do own it, it's OK. That's all I have to say."
3,"Selina, the girl with sorrow...","Since I'm Korean, a patch of blue was the very first book that I totaly read in English. I liked the book because it shows us that people are all equal, either African or white. The whole plot takes plae during the problems of society at the time of 1961.The date that the book was written is a time when most of the people were racist and had bad thourghts about blacks.This is the story about Selina, a blind white girl who lives in a small apartment with her mom. Her life was terrible until she meet Gordon in the park. The word TALORANCE is the main theme of this book. The story goes by what happens between Selina and Gordon. The ending of the book was so disappointing and depressing. It ends up with no conclution that make us think no more about the book. I hope the author comes up with some concluiton that solves the problem."
4,a patch of blue,"the book is about a blind girl who lives with her prostitute mother and drunk grandfather. selina does everything around her house, and her mother hates her and yells at her. she had a very bad life and until one day she was brought to the park and met gordon, who she falls in love with. the problem is that Selina has been brought up to dislike african americans, and she doesn't know that gordon is dark skinned.I thought i was a very good book. i""m reading it in english class, and the majority of the class (especially the guys) seem to not like A Patch of Blue, but i found it very engaging. the only problem for me was that the language Selina uses is like old-fashioned slang and sometimes it took me a while to realize what she was saying. and the end of the book was a little confusing."
2,An o.k. book,"The book A patch of blue is a book that does not hold your attention. The book starts off slow. The role playing was o.k. I would not read it again or even a first time, because I dont like those types of books."
4,Had to make adjustments to cage mounts,"Seems just the right size for our rabbit (Netherland Dwarf) and does secure to the cage as advertised. However, we had to make adjustments to the cage because of the way the clips on the litter box are angled, making it impossible to attach easily to the cage sides without clipping the wire."
4,litter training,"My rabbit uses it very well. The only problem is he kept eating the pellets. Had to start using a different litter. But the box is perfect. High enough that he doesn't miss. He alsolikes to sleep in it, before he uses it."
2,Bunny does not use,"My dwarf bunny does not use this at all! He could fit in it, but he doesn't like it for some reason and prefers a roomier litter pan. Also, this is the most uncomfortable pooper scooper ever. It's not shaped right for scooping anything, and most of the poop falls out through the slits! You'd think they would consider the proportionality of the scooper to the bunny..."
3,Nice idea - if only our rabbit would use it,"Our rabbit doesn't seem to care for it. Every time we clean his cage, he seems to pick another corner to do his business. Sometimes he picks the corner with the pan, but most of the time he picks the adjacent corner. We keep it ""primed"" with his droppings and some soiled wood chips, but he mostly ignores it.Also, if your pet is on the small side then the pan is a bit deep for them to use without climbing entirely into it. Our rabbit is a ""mid-size"" (not a mini, but not a full size) so it's a bit too deep for him to back up to, but too small for him to fit completely inside of while doing his thing. We attempted to compensate for the depth by recessing it in the cedar chips we use to line his cage, but he just isn't taking to it after the month or so we've had it. Also if you have the common type of rabbit cage with the deep plastic bottom, it's too deep for this pan to latch to the cage sides. We keep it in place by recessing it in the wood chips."
3,"Good Pan, Bad litter","This litter Pan is great! It is the perfect size for my 7 week old dwarf/lionhead rabbit, Alice. She hops right in and does her business. It clips onto the side of her cage so she can't knock it over.However, the 'Critter Litter' was awful! It was clay based and she liked to eat it. I was afraid of it being toxic because she is just a baby. It also clumped together like a ball, not individual like cat litter. It was a mess to clean up and really dusty. I switched to non-toxic wood based bedding and it's WAY better, much easier to clean and she doesn't eat it.She is basically trained after 2 weeks to only pee in this pan. Other than the litter, I would reccommend for a small rabbit."
1,Confusing Explanations - Not Worth Getting,"As a professional LSAT tutor/blogger in NYC, I can say that you'll need more than these explanations to gain a strong understanding of evidence/conclusion. Not only are these explanations confusing, but this book contains content that is also just plain wrong. More harmful than helpful in my opinion. Do not buy."
2,Not impressed....Left more confused than before the practice test.,"I wound up getting above the 90th percentile on the final test, but I give this book no credit for my score. I put this book away halfway through and focused on my other study materials, because I felt like I was not understanding the explanations, and they were confusing me more than helping me.That being said, it could have just been the way that I process things. I believe that it's important to invest in a variety of sources to prepare for the test. However, I would only invest in this book if you have already exhausted your other options.Good Luck on the test!"
3,"Great show, great season, horrible price!","Star Trek DS9 Season 7 is a great conclusion to one of the best Star Trek series, but the fact that Paramount hasn't lowered the cost of season 6 and 7 DVD sets to that of seasons 1-5 is dishearting. I recommend this season, but not the DVD set."
5,Finish the Show Right!!!,"Alot of shows don't finish there series the way fans expect them to end, but for me DS9 ends in a way that is satisfying. It closes the door on characters the way that it should be closed. Worf, Captain Sisko, Odo, and Kira carry the season for me. The stories mainly envolve around them with Bashir, Ezi Dax, O'Brien, and Nog sprinkle in every now in then. My favorite character Worf ends on a good note and the Captain fulfills his destiny and the rest just fall into place. The show continues its good story writing, which makes it standout more than any other Star Trek series or some of the movies. It is a great boxset, for this great show."
4,Romantic endings are nice and all for the viewer,"but they absolutely defy logic from the perspective of the characters. Odo pines for Kira for seven seasons, but he has to be with his ""people"" who just so happen to be a bunch of gooey, callous, xenophobic, egotistical megalomaniacs? I know, you want to teach your people about humility. Fine. Hop in a runabout (or just become a runabout) and dip your toe in The Great Link, but get your amorphous ass back to DS9 in time to watch Kira have dinner!"
4,Romulan Spy VS Starfleet Spy,"A good political episode that reflects current human scenarios, just the way Gene saw how Star Trek should be. Only con: open ending, and bad pacing. It's a good spy mystery in 46 minutes, and with Romulans. 3.9/5 Stars. ~Keep On Trekkin'"
4,The Cult of Dukat,"Star Trek focuses on a disturbing truth in our reality: Cults. It's a pretty good episode and somewhat important to the DS9 storyline. Cons: No Dominion stuff, Slow Pace. Pros: Freaky and Twisted. This is Dark Trek for sure. Not for the little one's! 3.9/5 Stars. ~Keep On Trekkin'"
2,Missing scenes,"It's a fun episode, but this review is for the streaming video - there's a scene and a half missing at about 23:50. ""a separated shoulder, two cracked ribs, and a"" ... then it cuts two scenes ahead. It's supposed to continue ""bruised ego"", the scene continues, and then go into a scene where the group learns about the captains' rivalry. You can find the transcript online to see what happened.I'm not complaining on Prime, but if you were to buy this, better wait until it's fixed."
3,Oceans 11 for the DS9 Crew,"Vic gets left out of the action. The DS9 crew dresses up, and plays holo-suite to help their photonic friend. It's cute, but a Stand-Alone episode that I couldn't quite get into. Pro: Avery Brooks singing. 3.1/5 Stars. ~Keep On Trekkin'"
2,The Ezri Mirror is Hot,The Alternate Universe. Where all the actors get to play their character opposite. Pro: Ezri. Cons: Everything else. I really don't like these. I have written 4 reviews on the subject of why I don't like the Alternate episodes. 2.6/5 Stars. On to the Next One. ~Keep On Trekkin'
3,"Nog's Leg, PTSD, and holosuite episode","Vic's got the world on a string. Here's the jist: Nog has lost his leg in combat, and has PTSD. A Holo-program helps get him back on his ""feet"". The End. It's no laughing matter or one to joke about as it deals with the seriousness of wounded Vets and combat fatigue. Now you can move along to the next episode. It's OK, but has nothing to do with any DS9 story arc, and the writers are overusing the holo-character of Vic. 3.0/5 Stars for the Vets. ~Keep On Trekkin."
1,technical problem,On instant video the sound quits at the 28 minute mark. Episode itself.was good it was frustrating not finishing it
1,VIC Fontaine ended Deep Space 9,Bringing vic into the series towards the end of the last season really took away from the plot lines. This episode like most of the episodes with that character seemed like just another commercial for his outdated Sinatra rip offs.
4,You will cry...,"...like a little girl. Aron Eisenberg is the actor playing Nog, and he's absolutely amazing in this episode. A lot of people who don't cherish ST or think it's just a sci fi show don't realize how talented it's cast has to be to make it seem so believable. They have to exist in an imaginary world, with extraordinary beings and phenomena....and still make it feel authentic.Every season has it's bad apples that pull you out of that experience (Wesley - TNG and Jake - DS9) but for the most part those are the exception. Nog hits it out of the park here, and at the conclusion his monologue made me lose it. You could feel his pain, how hard he was trying to bury it, so much anger with nowhere to channel it."
4,YAY! :D,"The War? YAY! More Garuk? YAY! Spies? YAY! covert missions? YAY! Diplomatic relations? YAYY!!Finally I'm reminded of how strong this season started out, DS9 is back! Really liked this episode...Get to see true Romulan-Federation relations and learn more about section 31. The ending had me doing double, no triple takes.it's amazing how different the quality of this series is episode to episode....I guess that can be attributed to the director and writers being rotated so frequently b/w episodes."
3,Not for everyone,"Know this up front: It's a stand-alone ""Fun and silly"" episode that can be skipped. The main section is also a very formulaic heist movie that gets too predictable.After watching it I felt like I should have skipped it. I did enjoy seeing the DS9 crew pull together for some good ol team work and getting to see Ezri with longer hair in a cocktail dress :D I'm just itching to get back to some REAL action, maybe that's why I gave it a 3/5. I wanna SEE THE WAR and EPIC SPACE BATTLES!"
1,Very dissatified.,Extreemly poor quality recording. The brightness of the picture was in continuos flux and mostly dark. Very irritating! I would not recommend this set.
2,Bleh.,"I wasn't quite ready for an Ezri episode yet. She was too new to the series to dedicate a whole episode to her and her family. The subject matter just wasn't that interesting, even the story with Miles wasn't quite up to snuff."
4,No reviews?,"It's Deep Space 9 - season 7 is fantastic TV. If you are not a trekky- oh well, maybe you won't like it, but I do!:-)"
3,Huge disappointment,"After season 6 leaves you on such high, season 7 is a huge disappointment. The writers get way off track forcing unneccessary character Ezri Dax unto the viewer without any rhyme nor reason.The season's opener is a continuation of 6's cliffhanger, but watered down to introduce Ezri Dax. The next few episodes also take you away from the strength of the series (its established characters and Dominion War storyline) to try and make the Ersatz Dax character have some relevance.The nadir of the series hits with the wasteful ""take me out to the holosuite"" epidsode. Simply horrible and a waste of an hour.It takes the writers the last 6 episodes to get on track, but even for a devout DS9 fan its a struggle to get the momentum back.This was a disappointing ending to a great, great series."
5,Saving Private Nog,"I remember in the first couple of seasons being disgusted by Nog's selfishness, immaturity and lack of respect for anything. It's a credit to the writers of DS9 that now he has become one of my favorite characters on the show (up there with Worf and Garuk). He has shown more heart, courage, and valor than most of the veteran crew and in this episode he is a shining example of what it means to be Star fleet officer (not only in actions but in attitude). You'd be a fool not to watch this one, it's everything you could hope for in a ST episode. Great action and great acting."
2,"Ezri's Mother ""Mother Dearest""","An Ezri Episode. Her family is evil. OK, it's slow, I'm Playing angry birds on another screen. It's all Ezri's family stuff with the Orion syndicate, and to be honest, I didn't care for it. And I love Star Trek. I remember watching this episode with fellow Trekkie's and we all threw empty beer cans at the screen (back when TV Sets could take more punishment). 1.9/5 Stars. If you love Trek, skip this. ~Keep On Trekkin'"
4,Overall good,This last season has some real clunker episodes but the last parts of the season focus back on the issues surrounding the war and its resolution.These more focused episodes are very well done and make season 7 a good purchase.
3,The Sisko is a Demi-Prophet,"They had to integrate the Benny story with Sisko's. I really didn't like that and just wish they did something else. If you skip all that stuff, then the episode is a solid 4.1, but cause of that I must take away half a star. 3.6/5 Stars. At least Benjamin can go home now. It's integral to the whole Sisko story, so worth watching. Pro: Worf's Battle for Jadzia's soul. ~Keep On Trekkin'"
5,The last few episodes are some of the best in the series,I suppose they had to have some other topics to start this season other than the war with the dominion. The episodes are good but this really gets good when the war and continuings with the dominion come into play. I'm not going to say who but one more of the major characters gets killed off in the last episode. It is also revealed that the plague that is afflicting the changling was introduced by section 31 of starfleet. I will tell you that cardassia eventually rebels against the dominion and it's new ally the breen. The last few episodes you just want to watch one right after another and ends the best wriiten star trek series.
4,Great Follow up To Bitch in the House,"If you read Bitch in the House, then you'll most likely enjoy this book. If not, read this book and then read Bitch in the House.This book is a good weekend read, but I didn't enjoy it as much as it's predecessor. Why Men Lie is the strongest entry in the anthology. And, the volume's weakness does lie with the homogeniety of the contributors. NY is not center of the world!Besides these pity complaints of mine, Bastard will help give women a glimpse into the pscyhe of the men we love--who sometimes can't do simple tasks! If you read the book- you know what this refers to.Read and enjoy."
4,"A self proclaimed ""bitch's"" take on Bastard...","I found ""Bastard on the Couch"" an engaging collection of viewpoints, some that made me laugh, rage and cry all in one story. It definitely waved things in my face that I had taken for granted in my own relationships with men throughout my life that definitely added a depth to my understanding of those dynamics, even answered some lifelong questions for me. I recommend it with enthusiasm to both women and men. I even read exerpts from it to my husband so many times that he started to say, ""Not something ELSE from that Bastard book again...."""
4,Funny and enlightening!,"This is, of course, the male response to ""The Bitch in the House."" Here, 27 men write essays on all aspects of relationships with women and some essays just simply trying to explain what makes them tick. Although several of the essays in the women's version were wittily written, I found the essays here more overtly funny, some of them quite funny. And yet these men, like the women, lay it all out there for all to read. In between the giggles and guffaws, I got a heck of a lot of insight into these men (and perhaps, by extension, other men). I'd have to name as my favorite essay ""Men in Houses"" by Ron Carlson, because it was so wry and sweet. But I enjoyed all the essays, even those by men I'm not sure I'd like to meet.If you decide to read this and haven't yet read ""Bitch in the House,"" I strongly suggest you read it as well, to keep the world in balance."
5,Hilarious,I was lucky enough to read the author's essay first. This is the only book where I couldn't stop laughing out loud. Since I'm on my third marriage every essay hit home and sent me back in time. This book is must for every guy who needs to know that they are not alone in frustration while dealing with women. This book is seriously an heirloom which will passed to my son!!
2,better than bitch.,"I read the female analogue of this book when it came out, and hated it -- the problems of a bunch of whining upper-middle-class magazine writers do not interest me. Now that I've read THE BASTARD ON THE COUCH, I know why. Although these men are pretty shallow overall, they're definitely more interesting than the women in their lives!I do wish there had been more of a range of experience here, but when you draw from a specific socio-economic pool, that is what you're going to get, like it or not. And I don't think people out of that demographic will read this anyway."
3,I dont care anymore I have two cats,"If you werent a lesbian before you read this book you will strongly consider converting after reading it.basically, men are guys , they arent men , they are guys. guys are not worth shaving your legs for. reality is a bitter pill best not taken.Women buy books like this and hope the truth will be something better then it is, yet the truth makes you prefer cats."
4,Great Music,"These guys formerly ""The Trenchcoats""--They decided to change their name after the Columbine incident--have been together a long time and they harmonize so well. This CD has some great stuff. I love good tight harmony and these guys are great live and on this cd. If you want to hear some great a cappella music this cd will have you tapping your fingers and wanting more. Bridge Over Troubled is awesome. Their tenor wails on Joy to the World and Dance Alone is beautiful. Enjoy some great music."
5,a fan for 10 years!,"I first saw the ""Trenchcoats"" when I was 16 and recently got to see them again now as ""The Coats"" uuuuuugggghhh! It made my YEAR. This CD is my favorite because of ""Your Joy"" it's my all time favorite! Their cds are very entertaining, but if you want a treat go to their concert!!!! You can find their tour info online with a search."
1,only for beginners,"I bought this book with the hope of learning something new. Although I did not read it from cover to cover, what I did read was too basic to be worth the money. Much of what is in the book could be learned at a beginning ceramics class in a park district class in one or two sessions. In fact, for the price, a park district class or other beginning ceramics class would be much more inspiring."
2,looks purdy - a half-... mouse,"I was so excited to see this mouse - as my flat panel monitor, speakers, and keyboard are all black - all I needed was a black mouse. Despite the drivers coming on a 3.5"" floppy with a home-job label on it called 'Mouse Suite' [scary!] - they didn't work for Windows 2000. So I search around ... site and finally found drivers that work, and I now have a fully-functional mouse.I love the LOOK of this mouse, but it is not exactly the best one I have used."
2,You get what you pay for,"To small to begin with. I am of average build but my hand seems huge on it. The position of everthing seems off. I play alot of first person shooters and I just hated it. The extras for the price are nice but I like quality above bells and wistles. So if want buget mouse and not gamer maybe, but only if you have small hands."
2,What's the point of this single??,Anybody who loves Nas should already have all these tracks. There's no real point in buying this unless you have a lot of extra money and you're some huge Nas fanatic.
3,Shipping was very slow,"shipping was very slow. I didnt get my product for 3 days after the date they showed as the latest id get the item. I wrote them an e mail and they responded proptly however. The product was what i wanted, its just the shipping i wasnt pleased with."
3,Pink Silicon Cover for my Motorola Razr,This cover isn't to bad.. They only thing I do not like about it is way up on the top of the cover (on the cell phone hinges )the straps are too skinny. So the case looks alittle weird but it does protect my Razr. That's the only problem with this case. But I got it for $6.54 (the whole total!) So I guess I can't complain when Verizon sells a similar case for $20.00.
4,"Just the Theme Song, please.","This is a great albumn if you like 50's & 60's movie classics like Ben Hur, Exodus, Dr Zhivago and Laura. While the entire soundtrack from those movies would be enjoyed, sometimes you want just the main Theme Song. This is great encapsulation of the favorites from that time period."
2,Only a cheep piece of plastic,Not up to the usual custom brackets quality. It is just plastic and doesn't fit particularly securely on my CB Junior. It will twist around as it has no molding to make it fit securely on the bracket arm. So it only just does its job for me holding a light weight microphone in lace. It would need readjusting all the time with something as heavy as a big flash or large microphone. Looks like the locking shoe mount is much better and costs the same price.
5,Best book I have read in a long time,"Bob goes into some deep and interesting ideas. It is a little far out there, but well written and entierly possible. You can either read this as a symble of how to improve your life, or as something completly true. Either way im sure following it will be life changing. After only attempting to apply it for a few days I notice how it really is a life changing concept."
5,Deceptive. You won't know its power unless you do The Process!,"In January of 2006 I offered appreciation for Bob's home transformational course of this same title. The past 10 months have been amazing. His book solidifies the information in his home course. The scientific basis is in the book. His philosophy is in the book and The Process is in the book. If you do exactly what he says in the book you don't need anything else. Just a hint...this isn't just about money. It's about transforming your life. I have had ""miracles"" in my life in every area. Leave your mind open. There are powerful and subtle differences to other stuff out there. Give yourself the gift of the book and do The Process every chance you can get for a week and then notice if there is any difference in your life."
2,one big question,"If Bob has created his world and all the characters in it, then who in the hell is he writing to. He claims we are all mere constructs of his higher power, yet he is writing this book in order to help us (his fictional characters ) rearrange our reality, which, by the way, would have been made up by him as well anyway. I guess he could argue that we (or I, cause you don't exist either) made him up in order to help myself, but it seems that he is pretty sure he exists. Confused? I hope so because this premise is ridiculous.This book is one big ""what if?"" model of reality with little logic and absolutely no factual basis for its premise. But here is the funny thing and why I gave it an extra star - I suspect that following the protocol of the book might actually work to some extent. It certainly could not hurt to feel more powerful and in control of one's life, but I for one could not go through the motions with a straight face."
5,Works With EFT and Continual Tapping,"I write things down on 3 by 5 cards review them daily and receive them in god's time. I don't ask how- I just receive inspiration and act on it. Rather than relying on my rational mind only, I use subconscious mind programming, prayer, and reliance on a power greater than my rational mind. Robert Scheinfeld's book expanded my ability in his emphasis on working with negative feelings. Also many of us blame someone else for our problems. His teaching emphasizes that each individual is responsible for creating his or her situation in life. Lots of people resist this notion especially people in prison or professional victims. Read the book your life will work better because you have more tools to be a victor and not a victim. We are finding that combining this with EFT tapping is an effective combination."
3,Busting Loose,"I bot this book and read it in less than a week. His concepts are interesting, had the same reaction when I saw the Matrix. While there might be some worthwhile ideas in the book, I don't see myself prescribing to this philosohy...A little too out there for me. Overall enjoyed it...but not life altering."
1,He Never does really say just what The Process Is,"I just finished reading Busting Loose from The Money game, and am still not entirely clear on just what The Process he talks about in this book is really all about. Just what is this mystical secret that I paid $20 to find out. It's still not clear to me after reading the entire book cover to cover. If it's just move out of the illusion and create what you want, then I really feel ripped off. I would have liked to have gotten some more nuts and bolts and more specific How To's than a re-statement of Hindu Belief. I thought Gary Renard's book, The Disappearance of The Universe covered many of the same areas, yet was better and more entertaining. Just my two cents worth."
3,To Believe or Not to Believe,"Very strange material. I don't know if he is being serious or just poking fun at all the self-improvement books on the market today. His whole premise is beyond belief - nothing is real, it's all part of your imagination - But everybody needs a new idea to sell and I guess he found an idea that is non-conventional."
2,Has He Been Committed Yet?,"He is insane - whether he believes what he wrote or not. According to this book, nothing is real. We're simply experiencing a physical presence until we move onto whatever is next. This goes to far. According to what he is saying ... you can commit murder and then wake up the next morning and realize that it simply wasn't real. That's right -- you made that up, it wasn't real. Well what if someone actually does commit murder and then says well this book told me it wasn't real??? There are plenty of desperate people out there who will believe this book. This book is ranked in the 2,000 range on Amazon!"
2,Too Mind-Blowing for me,These concepts were way too out there for me to comprehend or even want to pursue any further.
4,Busting Loose From the Money Game: Mind-Blowing Strategies for Changing the Rules of a Game You Can't Win,"This Book is a wonderful reminder that we are pure source energy, and we can attract money into our existence, as long as we have no energy blocks to receiving it, changing our fear of the lack of money into appreciation of the flow of it."
1,Absurd,This book is simply absurd. Basically it says that nothing is real. Everything you see is a hologram! Just stupid!
5,This is REAL! and Powerful!,"This book is a must if you are ready to break from the worry, the craziness and the pursuit of ""Being enough"" & ""Having enough"". It helped me to solidfy even further that ""I AM"" and that is all there is... and from that ALL is Created! The book is well written, Robert takes complicated topics such as Quantum Physics and builds an easy to understand application of these laws that allows the reader to connect to their unlimited potential.I began reading the book 3 weeks ago (Labor Day weekend) and the miracles that have resulted since then, I attribute to applying the ""Process"" outlined in his book.Buy it NOW!"
5,Mind Altering!,"Just when you think you understand the game of money a book like this comes along and changes the paradigm. I will now rethink all my strategiesand tactics for making and keeping my wealth. If you are open to learning the new rules for creating financial abundance in your life, I highly recommend this book.John Assaraf[...]"
5,Busting Lose from the Money Game,"Excellent book!!! Mr. Scheinfeld brings the most important elements of life together with ease and clarity. This is likely to be the best ""money"" book on the market because the author prioritizes how we do life from a greater perspective, and reveals what's REALLY going on here. If you're ready tobust loose from the illusions of life that are holding you captive, get this book. If you're not ready to take that step - get the book anyway and let it work on your subconscious mind. :)I actually recommended this book to my listeners on my radio show last week."
2,Can't swallow it,"This book was not quite what I thought it would be. I thought it would contain more practical information as opposed to new-agey philosophy. I guess I should have done more research on it before just buying it on impulse based on the hype-lines. Some points in it may be valid, such as how one's attitude towards money affects their reaction to dealing with it (of course), but the core concepts got a little too ""out there"" for me to swallow;I didn't feel its claims were supported remotely well enough. I actually couldn't stand plowing through the metaphysical weirdness of it anymore, and never finished the thing.I'm all for open-mindedness to a point, but one has to use discretion, and it just wasn't sounding plausible to me. I guess I'm unenlightened, eh?"
3,"Ok, but nothing revolutionary.","At first blush, it's very exciting but quickly looses it. Don't get me wrong, it does contain alot of truths and it certainly increased my understanding, but his Phase 2 work is just another view of Deepak Chopra's God-Response Stages 3-5 mentioned in How to Know God. However, seems like the author has become locked in Stage 5's traps of self-importance and solipsism. Finally, one has to wonder if he has really busted loose from the money game himself. If money is an illusion & he's busted loose, why does he ask for so much of it for his programs,etc.? Hope this helps. Namaste."
5,New Language,This book expands on the theme that money DOES have a direct tie to spirituality. The author applies his unique language in explaining the concept of abundance in its true sense. For those who are relunctant to 'go there' this may bring a set of tools to strengthen the bridge between the physical world and the spirit world.
3,Not What I'd Hoped For,"The book starts out promising enough discussing quantum physics, the limits of physical reality and how to break out of those limits. However, as I got going into the author's plan to break out, I began arguing vehemently with him, marking notes in the margins, and finally just tossing the book aside in absolute frustrating. For someone who claims we're too limited by ""The Money Game"" and other games created by a higher self that is looking for an ultimate experience, when he goes about relating his method for breaking out...he goes right back into a new set of limits...HIS. If you don't follow his plan explicitly his way, you can't break out. And his plan essentially has individuals seeking out a long Dark Night of the Soul in order to get past some barrier. I'm sorry, I believe that all he has done is create his own version of torment, and I don't intend to join him in it."
5,Far beyond the Law of Attraction,"Robert writes this book for everyone from the physicist to the common, ordinary blue collar transformer. His explanation as to what's really going on here, is simple and yet mind blowing at the same time. With the insight of this book, I've never done so little and received so much.If you're ready for the next piece of the puzzle, this book will throw it at your head like a Major League Baseball Pitcher.Grab your glove. It's a must read."
1,This whole book a rip-off,"The process which the author calls ""the crown jewel of the Busting Loose process"" is pretty much a disguised version of one of 5 Sedona releasing strategies which Hale Dwoskin calls ""Diving in."" All the material surrounding this ""process"" is just filler fluff designed to create the illusion that the author thought of something original. Go ahead. Do a Google search for diving in. You'll eventually find a blog or message board somewhere that talks about this technique."
1,Really Out There,"This book takes the new age theme of ""spiritual beings"" on a physical journey to new lengths, too much for this reader. A couple friends also tried to read it and couldn't get through it. It's just too far out there for us more practical types. But if this is what you want, try it; you might like it."
1,Give me money to tell you money doesn't matter.,"How hilarious that this guy is selling a book for money that says money doesn't matter. This is a con to separate you from your money. Our money system is broken and there are some real solutions out there but this is not one of them.Here are some more grounded books:The Future of Money: Creating New Wealth, Work and a Wiser WorldThe End of Money and the Future of CivilizationLocal Money: How to Make it Happen in Your CommunityThere is another book soon to be released by Bernard Lietaer called ""Of Human Wealth"" but it's not listed as of my writing this."
1,It works?,"I followed the advice and visualized a garbage can and by gosh there it was and the book quickly disappeared into it. This is the biggest piece of Crap that I have read. I was lucky that I payed a dollar for it at the Library sale- at least the dollar went to a good cause.I am a very open minded person and have read many great books - Secret of The Ages, Vernon Howard - any of his books, Napoleon Hill, the Bible- the list goes on. A feel sorry for the author of this book as he is delusional and has watched to many SciFi movies. We are all ready a society that is with drawing from reality and this book takes you further down that path.There are enough good wright-ups to give you the gist of the book - all I can say is save your money and don't waste the time reading it - it is time you will never get back!"
3,Sorry...not for me!,"A one-time subscriber to Scheinfeld's newletters, I thought I would enjoy Busting Loose and was disappointed that I found it difficult to finish.Robert Scheinfeld is a successful (guru type) businessman who is a gifted, creative, and awesome person. For some reason, Busting Loose to me was a lot about almost nothing. He has written other books and articles, I highly recommend you try those instead of Busting Loose From The Money Game!"
1,operating under false colors,I had hoped for a more sensible approach to the subject. Instead it was a cockeyed New Age piece of nonsense.
1,He got one term right......,"Let me get this straight, everything in my life, including the wife and kids, I created. Hmm....so if I just ignore reality, which isn't reality anyway, then I can have everything I ever wanted! Huh????...Well at least he got one term right to describe this, BULLS***."
1,This book has NOTHING to do with money. Don't waste your time or money,"This book has nothing to do with money. It is a book full of vain philosophies, none of which are backed with any proof whatsoever. If you are looking for good books on managing money, getting out of debt, or building wealth I would recommend books such as: The Total Money Makeover by Dave Ramsey; Rich Dad, Poor Dad by Robert Kyosaki; Multiple Streams of Income by Robert Allen; and Money, What Financial ""Experts"" Will Never Tell You by Alan Williams, Peter Jeppson, and Sanford Botkins. Also check out the website and resources found at [...]."
1,Success Mumbo-Jumbo,"I had hopes for this, really I did. Two chapters in, I was sorry I spent the money. This book goes one step beyond the ""feel good"" health and wealth gospel that is so pervasive today. Chaos Theory is easier to swallow than this stuff, but if you would like to travel to another dimension to get rich, be my guest. If just one person who reads this gets rich in spite of the far-fetched ideas, then I suppose the author has succeeded. Don't waste your money; read a real person like Jim Rohn, Brian Tracy or Zig Ziglar."
1,Busting loose from the money game,"This book is the most rambling and contradictory book I have ever read. He suggests that everything that you see and do is ""smoke and mirrors"", doesn't actually exist. People, buildings, furniture the lot all created by your consciousness. He then goes on to explain how his program has helped his wife which, of course, of course would be impossible because she does not exist. She was created by his mind or in this case by my mind. To go the next obvious step, there would no way that a book that he wrote could show up in my ""hola gram' as nothing is real so wrote the book. I wonder if amazon will send me the money for his sales? Oh wait, amazon is not real!"
4,Good but repetitive,"Great information , nice presentation, a little repetitive. I loved the simple, accessible , practical translation of quantum physics reality into direct and meaningful practice. Found the examples disappointing and really not supportive of the presentation."
1,One of the dumbest books ever written,"Save yourself the $16.00. Here's the secret offered by this book: ignore reality and start pretending that money doesn't matter.Stay tuned for the much awaited volume 2 which will cover how to convince your creditors, grocer, mortgage holder, utility company, insurance company, etc. that money doesn't matter.Read the comments above in Bob's blog section (Amazon Connect) for the truth.Click on the Comments link at the bottom of it."
4,Phantom Blues Band,"I am a fan of these guys and have always found their music to have a mixture of several styles of blues. Their singer Mike Finnigan also plays the Hammond B3 and generates great sound. I am looking forward to the next CD.Willy Los Alamitos, CA CA aka batman'84"
4,Smooth suede,This scabbard fits over the sword like a glove. The detail in it is wonderful. The feel of the suede is great. Recipient loved this!
3,Meh...,"Having just received my Strider and Anduril scabbard I was actually disappointed with this one.It is extremely light and flimsy feeling compared to the other UC scabbards. The pictures make it look like the leather is smooth and shiny but is the cheap rough leather like you get on the inside of leather straps.Luckily I only paid 55 for it, I'd be kicking myself if I paid 200 like the others.It does look good on the wall hanging with glamdring, just wrap the straps around the scabbard and it keeps it tight against the sword."
4,Pleasantly understated entertaining Western.,"Bill holden portrays a cynical union officer at Fort Bravo. Despite his hard bitten reputation, he grows roses. He's in charge of protecting the fort from Indian attack and Confederate prisoner escapes. However, for all his experience, he gets distracted by a woman of course, who's secretly assisting a Confederate escape. This all leads up to an exciting climax, when confederate and union officer must join forces to survive Mescalero attack. Bill Holden shines in this role, bringing his usual natural charm to a western that quietly goes about it's business to it's suspenseful end. Some really romantic lines in this one too!"
3,westerns,This is on of the better b westerns but no where near in the class of John Wayne or even William Holdens later movies.
5,good,"this was a good movie I liked the shootout at the end,very good plot.would reccommend to anyone who enjoys watching westerns and cavalry movies."
4,Just a good ol' western,"I enjoyed watching this film, doesn't drag along but it's not just a shoot-em-up either. If you like William Holden then you will like this movie, I think he does a good job in his role."
4,Another escape!,Quite well-made western with Holden a tough army officer and beautiful Eleanor Parker the femme fatale. Director John Sturges (the Great Escape)is usually good for some fine action scenes. Exciting climax!
3,Smells Medicinal lacks bubbles,"Although Smell and lack of bubbles,does not dry out your skin.But does leave residue on tub bottom after draining.Still a small price to pay for being green."
5,Amazon does it again,"Bumble Bee made it taste good. Amazon the cost really great. As the price of EVERYthing goes up Amazon manages to keep offering up great deals on great tasting foods. And I dont miss having to deal with traffic,crowds and long lines at the store."
5,Delicious,Love this healthy snack. The tuna has just the right amount of spice and the whole chili is a nice bonus.
5,Awesome Tuna and Crackers!,"I LOVE the Thai Chili tuna kits! The tuna is spicey and the crackers are a tiny bit sweet, and the combination is divine."
4,i like it,this tuna is soo good if you want a change try this tuna and it's not too spicy. I wish it came with more crackers other than that this is a must have product in my pantry.
4,A travel staple,"I travel in remote areas for work and my gear gets thrown around a lot. I appreciate the box that the tuna kit comes in because the crackers are always whole, no matter what has happened. I buy this tuna kit instead of other ones because it has the simplest ingredients: no corn syrup, no artificial weirdness, no modified anything. The very small can is a good serving size for me. The spice is pretty intense and I know many people who would not like it, but it is fine for me. I usually mix in crushed kale chips to add a vegetable to my meal. I often save the enclosed mini-spreaders and have started to save the plastic boxes to make other meal kits, so in a way, it is possible to reduce the amount of packaging wasted by this product. This is one of my travel staples and I always have some on hand. I'm not giving it five stars only because there are tuna products out there (such as bonito del norte) that have far superior flavor and are the only ones that I give five stars."
5,An invaluable historical resource concerning cannabis.,"Cannabis: a History is an invaluable and concise history of cannabis as a drug, and as a literary and historical entity. The book is very well documented; it's notes form a valuable road map to a wealth of historical material. This is truly a job well done."
2,sketchy scholarship indeed,"I agree with the previous reviewer-- decent read, but mediocre writing and scholarship. I counted 3 consecutive paragraphs in one chapter that all ended with sentences beginning with ""It could be said that..."" The whole book seems breezy and rushed and one gets the feeling that the only reason it exists is to capitalize on the success of the author's previous pop-scholarly tome on Opium. It is also riddled with the usual BS one finds in books on drug culture written by academics and outsiders-- outdated slang; silly, unsupported anecdotes and hearsay; constant reminders that the author is ""NOT advocating for legalization, but...""."
3,"Interesting Subject, Sketchy Scholarship","This isn't a bad book, and the subject matter is fascinating, but I found the book to be full of questionable research and great leaps in logic. For example, the author says that the expression ""chill out"" is from chillum, a primitive type of pipe that has been in use for thousands of years. ""Chill Out"" didn't enter the vernacular until the 1990's. There are many of these instances in the book."
2,Interesting novel,"I think this book is an interesting novell. But I wonder why the author first tried to market it as a 'real story'.Nevertheless it is an exciting read but especially the part about the Dutch submarine seems too far fetched in my opnion. But maybe that is just because I know a litle about the subject. :-)One shoul;d know that Creighton also wrote the book ""Op JB"". (...)All in all it is an exciting book for anyone interested in WWII and/or spy stories."
1,Careful: there is a monster in these pages,"The character of the Paladin is just a soldier doing his job. The monster in this book is Owl, who justifies any number of crimes he forces the young hero to commit ""for England."" Of course assassinating enemy personnel is no shock during war, but the early sequences where Paladin is ordered to murder a bunch of English and Dutch citizens (including a young woman) who have totally unwittingly stumbled onto an important war secret are repugnant and insane in their rationalization. Apparently Owl had never heard of the word ""internment"" until Churchill himself points out how such things should be handled. Also, please enjoy the part where English commandos in training are ordered to practice their killings techniques on German POWs. Poor Owl missed his calling -- he would have been right at home in the Gestapo."
4,An entertaining narrative about private aviation.,"A dated, although highly intersting and entertaining account of the author's experience of learning to fly private airplanes in the late 1950s. For the modern pilot, it provides a great sense of perspective on the simpler days of aviation, and a wonderful reminder of why many of us learned to fly in the first place. For the individual considering taking flying lessons, while much of the technical information is outdated, the book's anecdotes and narrative still serve as a solid primer of what to expect as you become a private pilot."
4,"""Who Sez?"" by Scott Yanow, All Music Guide to Jazz","Pianist Eric Gould alternates three of his originals with jazz standards from John Coltrane, Cedar Walton, Joe Henderson, Wayne Shorter, and Horace Silver on the modern straight-ahead jazz set Who Sez?. Gould plays quite well (with touches of early Herbie Hancock, Keith Jarrett, and McCoy Tyner in his ideas), while Talib Kibwe on alto and soprano sometimes comes close to overshadowing the leader. Trumpeter Pharez Whitted has his spots too, but the focus is primarily on Gould and Kibwe. The modal music, much of it based in the 1960s, is well served by these talented musicians, and although the playing is not flawless (plenty of chances are taken), it is never dull. The musicians all show strong potential for the future. - Scott Yanow"
3,Content Excellent but marred by poor video.,"I was dissapointed in this video from the viewpoint of very poor video quality. Barely on a par with VHS. I have a 480P front projector with an 80"" diagonal picture and it was unwatchable on that system I had to view it on my 36"" tv to have an acceptable picture and even then it was not great. I have several Andre Rieu videos and have never run into that before. According to other reviews Denon has put out a very poor product this time.The show itself is terrific as Andre always is."
5,Good movie from the past,I remember seeing this movie years ago when it came out to the theaters. I was only a teenager in the middle of World War II. The scenes of being a prisoner of war made a great impact on me. I read the book and found the details of survival very interesting. I have both the book and the VHS and have enjoyed seeing and reading both again over fifty years later. Claudette Colbert is terrific as usual. I would recommend the book first and the movie second.
3,Colbert gives a Great performance,"If you are a Colbert fan or not or simply want to know her, this movie should be on your list! She gives a good range of her acting (even if Hollywood believes that mascara was easy to come by in a Japanese camp!). What`s more, Sessue Hayakawa, a typical villain, proposes a sweet & sour taste to his character rather uncommon to his more typical roles. And if you liked that movie, go to ""So Proudly We Hail"", a story with a similar plot but even better!"
3,"Great Movie, bad film, NOT IN COLOR as stated in description.","I bought this movie because i dreampt of a part in the movie. As clear and as accurate as the real movie. i had never seen it though, so this had me intrigued; so I bought it to add to my collection.Out of the three production companies that sell this movie on amazon, I chose this one, and am a bit dissapointed. The film is in black & white, whereas it states it is in color. That was my main reason for choosing this one. And the film (not the disk, the recorded film itself) has scratches and poor quality throughout. This is a DVD that looks like a poorly maintained original 1950s copy on vhs.The movie itself, and the true story it tells, is very emotional. It is one great movie- a heart-wrenching story of what the women and children stuck in the midst of war had to live through.I would definatly reccomend this movie to all, just would say to buy from another film production company."
5,I dare you not to cry,"My Mother told me about this movie. She first saw it in a movie theater in 1950. It became somewhat of a running joke between us, not because it was funny in any way, but neither one of us could watch the ending without crying. We would both leave the room! I get misty-eyed even thinking about it. The main point I want to make is that it is a beautifully made and well acted movie that I would highly recommend."
5,Truly the BEST of the BEST,Every quartet on this CD serves as a shining example of excellence in women's barbershop. I'm so very proud as a member of Sweet Adelines International to have this kind of quality recording represent me to the public at large....
4,Value,"These are a great value and work as good as the expensive glasses, in addition the adjustability is just great."
3,Many choices on lenses,"I was surprised by just how many lenses and accessories come with this very complete package. The lens change out is a bit awkward, but with the sheer variety of lens choice which will cover just about any lighting condition you encounter, it more than makes up for that. Great packaging, I really do think the tilt feature is useful as hearing and eye protection at present isn't really integrated. I use them for shooting, where cheek weld, eye relief and clarity are all important and these do the job well.After having purchased 4 sets, the one great weakness is the frame. When changing out lenses, the nose piece design is very vulnerable to breaking - 2 sets now, particularly when they are cold. I won't be buying another pair. (I do wish I could just buy the frames) Good lenses and a good concept that needs more work"
3,"Adjustable angles, but maybe too large for women","These glasses are a good price with switchable lenses offering the ability to choose a shade suitable to various environments. The best feature is a small ratcheting mechanism at each stem near the temple joints. These can be somewhat customized to fit individual face shapes.Perhaps glasses should also be made in 80% size for people with overall smaller faces/bone structure. (I grow weary of so many tools, car seats, controls, etc. that are about 16% too big to use ergonomically well.) At any rate, the ratchets are a good move toward making glasses that will fit many people well. The adjustments need a larger range. These same joint features could also apply to make the nose bridges more narrow/more wide, change arc against face, etc."
3,"Good glasses, but...","These are high quality glasses but not good for shooting. They would be great for general use but I bought these for sporting clays and skeet. The frame at the bridge of the nose interferes with sighting down the barrel of a shotgun. I like the adjustable features for temple length and angle, but couldn't get them to fit where the frame didn't interfere. I like everything about them except the frame. After 2 shots I switched back to my cheap yellow tinted safety glasses. If you're looking for shooting glasses for casual wear, these are great. They're just not good for shooting."
3,EDITED!?! Salem is not pleased!,"While one cannot fault the brilliance that is ""Sabrina The Teenage Witch"", one can also not help but be disappointed that these episodes are EDITED versions. Please don't call something ""complete"" when it isn't. Hopefully season 2 will have COMPLETE, UNEDITED episodes. Is that so hard?"
4,"Love the show, hate the edits!","Ok, I love Sabrina! One of my all time favourite shows! I was however particularly frustrated when I noticed that they have changed a lot the music in the episodes. They removed the original tracks and replaced them with really lame compositions that at times don't seem to work wih the moment. WHY DO THEY DO THIS TO US!!! WE WANT IT ORIGINAL!!!! THE WAY WE REMEMBER IT!!!!"
4,Complete first season of TV-series,"This is the complete first season of Sabrina the Teenage Witch (original airdate 1996/1997).On her 16th birthday, Sabrina Spellman (Melissa Joan Hart) discovers that she has been given the gift of magic. Her aunts Hilda (Caroline Rhea) and Zelda (Beth Broderick) inform her that she is a witch. The series contain a sense of humour and can be quite sweet without getting childish.The box set contains four DVDs. Video and audio quality are good. Each disc has its own title menu for easy access to a particular episode.Episodes:PilotBundt FridayThe True Adventures of Rudy KazootieTerrible ThingsA Halloween StoryDream DateThird Aunt From the SunMagic JoelGeek Like MeSweet and Sour VictoryA Girl and Her CatTrial by FuryJenny's Non-DreamSabrina Through the Looking GlassHilda and Zelda: The Teenage YearsMars AttractsFirst KissSweet CharityCat ShowdownMeeting Dad's GirlfriendAs Westbridge TurnsThe Great MistakeThe CrucibleTroll Bride-----"
5,love it,"oh my gosh I have wated for this since I was in preschool I always wached this show.This show is one of my fave shows Hannah Montana,Unfablous and sabrina I am totally going to buy this DVD!!!"
5,Love it!,"I was so excited to get Sabrina on DVD - such a great show! And now I can watch it whenever I want :). Even though my husband won't admit it, I know he enjoys watching it with me!"
4,Better quality print,"A better quality print.But no sub-titles.I love this.The episodes are fun and remind me of my college days.No extras in DVD, but the DVD cover has details of every episode."
4,"nino rota, pre godfather but post romeo and juliet","I owned the LP of the this CD in college. My friends thought I was a little peculiar for liking the music. (I'm also one of the few people who liked the movie). It's a pastiche, but stylishly done, and at times stirring. My only two gripes are the length (only 34 minutes) and, in places, the poor sound quality, which might be due to the relatively low regard people had for soundtracks in the 1960s."
2,Fashion freedon perhaps but only for a few,"I am 27 years old and in something of a transition stage with my wardrobe and I thought that this would be the book for me. This book does offer some useful advice. It encourages the readers to determine who they are and what they want to project before shopping and it does give some pointers for looking for quality garments. These are helpful. They do use a number of technical terms and illustrations and/or line drawings would help to illustrate this and would help people to distinguish between terms. My main complaint is that this book mainly seems to be written for people who are either corporate or sartorially clueless or a mixture of both. Being neither of these, it was only moderately helpful."
2,Some useful info but not worth the effort,"The description on the cover made this book sound really interesting but it turned out to be too much a jumble of information. I did get some useful hints from it, but not nearly as many as I had expected. I missed any pictures of what they were describing. That would have helped a lot. And the writing was pretty clunky and the subjects jumped all over the place, so that made it more difficult to enjoy."
5,emphasis on individualtiy,"I read this book a few years ago, and while I did not do all the excercises (in fact, I can't remember if I did any), I loved the book and the concept that it is more important to know who you are and what image you want to give off than to know the ""right"" things to wear. I enjoyed the personal stories of the people who shared their journeys into the shark infested waters of style. This book gave me confidence that I would know what was right for me when I found it. I read a lot of books at that time about body types and color charts, etc, but this is the one that made the biggest impression. You won't find any cookie cutter advice or rules to cramp your style in here!"
4,Surprisingly good!,"I like to read fashion books for fun, and was expecting this one to be more of the same. It isn't! Its introspective quality may irritate some people: I thought it was going to irritate me, because I hate self-help books, but I really enjoyed it. If you're looking for a book about clothes, this is probably not the book for you; it will not tell you what style fits your body type, or what fabrics are better than others. It will help you discover your relationship to your clothing, and help you develop that relationship to a point where you don't have to think about it anymore. The goal is to make dressing and shopping easier as well as better suited to you. Be warned: this book has exercises you are expected to accomplish before proceeding to subsequent steps, but I found them fun and useful. If you're looking for something different, you might give this a shot."
5,One of the Most Powerful Books I've Ever Read,"I flew through this book because I could not stop reading it. The details of life growing up in the Bronx were truly mind blowing, especially for someone who grew up in a super sheltered environment.However, the best part of this book is how Canada relates how the gun culture has doomed inner city children to an adolescence of violence and how something must be done to change this.This is the most powerful anti-gun books I have ever read, and the message isn't shoved down your throat, it's told through the author's own life experience which makes it that more powerful.A must read."
4,Good,"The book is in great condition and I got the book within a reasonable amount of time. I got the right book but I was not sure at first because the book I got did not have the same cover as the book in the picture, but I checked and it is the same book, just different cover. Little confusing since I was expecting the cover that was in the picture."
4,A little gem of a graphic novel.,"Fist Stick Knife Gun is a perfect example of what else there is besides superhero books. It's not a huge book which helps keep that personal story feel. The story is well told and one worth telling. This is one of those unique graphic novels that used to be very rare, but thankfully are making a comeback. The kind of GN that you could easily recommend to someone who doesn't read graphic novels or is tired of men in capes. There is some real street violence, the kind you'd find on a real street. It can be a bit of a downer in parts, but that's because of the subject matter and not the quality of the book. The quality is good so Give Fist Stick Knife Gun a look."
4,Interesting perspectives on ghetto youth violence.,"Good book, a little repetative.He's right, adults and those in charge have failed the children. That said, guns are just a tool. Before guns, the strongest and biggest ruled. Guns are the great equalizer. It sucks that they are misused, but no more than knives previously."
4,A Riveting Account of Urban Proving Grounds,"This is a riveting and heart wrenching book about the trials and tribulations of urban youth. The stories are relate-able, even from other walks of life. The stories and experiences transcend the Bronx; and while not as gruesome or desperate, the themes permeate through all childhood in America these days.This is a great book to share and read with children; it gives an exceptional opportunity to have conversations surrounding sensitive topics with your children. It just might change their lives and bring you closer together."
5,I loved this book,"This book is a great read and really shows this kind of lifestyle in a different light. Interesting and kept my attention, which is saying a lot considering I rarely read."
2,Not very interesting,"I read this constantly waiting for drama, a new and inspiring message, anything. Here's the poop: Impovershed neighborhoods are dangerous places filled with young people who grew up fighting and now have firearms. If you visit certain streets in Harlem, sounds like a bullet proof vest is in order. It sucks to be poor. The author is a good person who has helped many in need. This book should have been a pamphlet."
3,Eco Rangers is incredibly lame & expensive,"In eco rangers, all you do is answer ?'s and I bought it for $25!! :( Also, once you finish it, there is nothing left to do!!P.S. Hans Weber's son, Finn, wrote this."
5,Only the best,Another Richard Cheese diamond mine! I can actually say I jam out to this in my car.This is the best album out of all of them.
3,Pure cheesiness,"Yes this cd lives up to the ""cheese"". It's definitely catchy, cheesy, kitschy, fun. It's very funny and amusing the first time around - throw it on and watch people's reactions - but after the first time through, it definitely diminishes with repeated playing. Overall fun though."
3,No 2000 Drivers,"Although it has a nice feel, this product does not function properly with windows 2000. The scroll doesn't work, nor do the 3 additional buttons on the side. Bummer."
4,No XP Drivers Either,"Enjoyed the mouse while running WinMe. When I upgraded to XP, the mouse wheel and three side buttons did not function properly. If you are running an operating system before Win2000 or WinXP, this is a good mouse. Otherwise, save yourself from the hassel and spend the extra money for a newer mouse."
1,"payed for, did not recieve",could do a review if I ever recieve it. Ordered three items and only recieved two
3,Must be Good Live But.....,"This CD is full of Cliche Blues and rock and roll..Yes I can see them being great if you had a few brews in you at your local watering hole..But this album has week songs ..Rick Estrin'svoice is weak and plays harmonica like Charlie Mussel White ""light""..Great tone without the technique or aggressiveness..Now if this group had a leader like John Hammond say,they would be a adequate back up band and this album would be better...But as it is... its OK..I first heard the instrumental Slap Happy which rocks and made me go out and buy this record..Guitarist and Leader Little Charlie Batty plays a great guitar but is not featured enough..I would have enjoyed this album better with some quality cover songs and alot more guitar playing..These guys are tight and professional but ultimately the material doesn't move me..But decide for yourself ..It is worth a listen."
4,Like it..,"I like the soundtrack because im very hooked with the game. Specially, when you finished the game, i love the music that is playing (Disc 2 Staffs and Credits) very much. It want to feel like ""you did it!"" thing.. And i also felt the tense and horror of the music, really.. So if you want to complete your collection of resident evil soundtracks, this is a must! And oh, if you want to have a copy of this in mp3, just let me know. I know a website that is offering a download of soundtracks of all Resident Evil, that's right. ALL!!"
3,Review,"My order came in an almost diassembled box. The paper packages were torn, though no dammage was done to the paper as far as I can tell. I was under the impression that this was a professional company, I was disappointed by the results."
5,"On time, inexpensive and in good condition",The price was right for this size paper. It's way less expensive than Office Depot. I received it in 2 days and it was in perfect condition. I will be using this as my regular supplier of 11X17 paper.
2,wrong size,"really upset ordered wrong size after it got here it was going to cost me too much to send it back so i seat here and cut it in half so its the right size , but thats what i get for ordering the wrong size"
5,Bee Gees- One Night Only: the best of the best 5+++,"This is one of my favorite music collections. It is such a great mix ofBee Gees' songs. Everytime I watch and listen to it, I feel like I've taken in an in-person concert. The guest spot with Celine Deon is just an additional treat. I would highly recommend the DTS for anyone enjoys the Bee Gees' legendary tunes. F. Mills, Bay Area, California"
5,Bee Gees-One Night Only,"Concerts don't get much better than this one. We've watched it countless times and still enjoy it as much as the first time.If you like the Bee Gees, this one is definitely a green light. DTS and surround sound gives you a front row seat at the concert. Awesome!"
2,"I was warned, but did NOT listen...","I only buy DTS concert DVDs. My setup is top of the line. I apparently did not want to believe the reviews which hammered the DTS recording quality of this concert, but they were right. The vocals are incredibly muddied, and the center channel seems to be dedicated exclusively to a snare drum. I basically have to turn my center channel off to hear lyrics, and they still don't sound that great.Compared to the Eagles, Steely Dan, Orbison DTS recordings, this concert sounds [bad]. The video quality is very good, but there's no point in cranking the sound. If DTS is your thing, you've been warned..AGAIN!"
1,it was a damaged item,when I received the product it was wet and rusted. I sent it back because there was no way I could use it.
3,DTS defect,"The DTS on my disc is defective,only sound comes from the left channel.I switched over to the 2.1 mode and the sound became louder and the sound was normal for the recording.The decoder light had activated but the decoding was low and only one channel. I e-mailed the dvd company about this and am waiting for feedback. The performance is good,but the 5.1 isn't there."
3,good songs bad production,"I love bee gee's songs and I own this DVD(DTS version). I am not sure whether it is just my copy. The audio is not up to any dolby digital standard not to mention DTS. Most of the time, the center and the sourround channels do not have much music effect/instrument or vocal, except occasional background noise and audience's applause.I am not sure whether this is malfunctioning that happened to a certain number of DVD produced at a certain time. If it is, then i would ask for a return/refund.If all DVDs produced are like this.Then this is really bad production. A bad DVD at the expense of very good, memorable songs by BEE GEEs. (e-mail:dlee_at@yahoo.com)"
5,Ever had a really bad day?,"If you have, I would suggest to you this concert. The Bee Gee's take you through their 30+ years of history sharing the joys and pains of their time together. Put on this DVD and experience one of the best musical recordings in terms of quality sound (mix) you may have ever heard. It's a roller coaster of ballads, disco and classic hits. A winner!"
5,Do I like it? Have viewed it close to 100 times,"Not one poorly done song on the entire video. The camera work was great. There is none of the usual ""fast"" quick-views of the performers, and the views of the audience are minimized and appropiate. There is no useless chit-chat, nor silly childish laughter. Just straight forward performing by three men in there 50s. I am an Elvis nut, never paying attention to the BeeGees. Bought the tape for indoor exercising,and I love it. Bought the CD,made a tape for ouside exercising. Its playing now as I type this. Am considering getting a ""back-up"" video. Don't let this one pass you by!!!"
5,One of the Best,Almost 2 hours long and not a bad moment in the whole thing. Ranks up there with the James Taylor and Tina Turner DVDs for sound quality.
3,Disappointed,"I bought this product based on reviews from here. Sadly, I was disappointed. What is there is great. But what IS NOT there is also great. Specifically, I was VERY disappointed to see the song list but to see that MANY of my favorites were only played through the 1st verse ie 1/3 through. I kept thinking.. Is that all?? Yes, it was. Why are they stopping now?For me, the playlist was too long... but also too short... I thought that many of the songs should have been off the playlist entirely but many of the other songs should have been played through their entirety...Yea.. I get that the Bee Gees have been around for X decades.... But still.. Look at the songs that were shorted... And look at the OTHER songs.. Kill the other songs and play the songs that most songs want to hear.."
5,Bee Gees...B.G...Brilliant & Great,"How could one complain about this disc when the picture quality is so sharp and clear, the sound quality second to none and a full song list representing all their well known music through the years. I really cannot fault this disc and everyone who has seen it, has enjoyed it. At 2 hours 10 minutes it's just like being at one of their concerts. Bravo."
5,Truly enjoyable!,"I'm not a huge fan of the Bee Gees, although I grew up with their music and think they are amazing songwriters. My whole life, the Bee Gees have always had a song on the radio, so for me, they are part of my personal soundtrack. I picked up this DVD on a whim, and enjoyed it so much I think I watched it three times in one weekend. It's still in the player, ready to go again. Simply wonderful! Love them!"
5,ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT!!!!,Absolutely fantastic!!!! i've grown up with this music all my life....They are just brilliant.. don't think there is any words in the world to describe how i feel about this dvd. and to make things absolutely great i got the DVD at the brillaint price as well.It just brings back so many great memories.....WELL DONE GUYS! U DESERVE A GOLDEN MEDAL FOR YOUR CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS TH EMUSIC INDUSTRY...LOVE YOU GUYSGISELA NOBLE
5,Yay!,It was good and got everything together just the gift I wanted to get my dad. Just have to wait till Christmas to see his reaction.
3,Good songs but audio recording disappointing to me,"I love bee gee's songs and I own this DVD(DTS version). I am not sure whether it is just my copy. The audio is not up to any dolby digital standard not to mention DTS. Most of the time, the center and the sourround channels do not have much music effect/instrument or vocal, except occasional background noise and audience's applause.I am not sure whether this is malfunctioning that happened to a certain number of DVD produced at a certain time. If it is, then i would ask for a return/refund.If all DVDs produced are like this.Then this is really bad production. A bad DVD at the expense of very good, memorable songs by BEE GEEs. (e-mail:dlee_at@yahoo.com)A good dts music dvd to model after is 'Hell freezes over' by Eagles - best use of all 6 channels in a well planned/beautifully mixed architecture. (i am not as great fan of Eagles, but this dvd is by far the best engineered, audio-ly and video-ly)"
5,"Great sound, felt like I was at the concert, a must have",This was my first music DVD and I was really impressed with the sound and the video. I only hope I can find other artists concerts of this caliber.
4,Bee Gees - One Night Only - DTS,"I love the Bee Gees, always have. The DTS version gives you that fantastic Bee Gees music as it should be heard ... no problem there, loved it. My only beef is the FULL SCREEN presentation ... UGH! I don't know if this thing ever came out in a WIDESCREEN version, but never saw it available."
4,Bee Gees- One Night Only,"This was a very good performance. The Bee Gees perform most of all of the songs that made them famous. Some of the songs were not performed in their entirety, such as ""Nights on Broadway"". There was not much showmanship other than the Bee Gees standing on the stage and singing."
2,DTS Sound,I rate this concert 2 stars. I would give it 4.5 stars if the DTS sound was anything like it should be. My stereo system is all kenwood top of the line with 4 grand in jamo speakers and all my other DTS movies and concerts on DVD sound great. This DVD in DTS sounds like ?hit. That Is all I have to say and that is that. DO NOT I MEAN DO NOT BUY IT FOR THE SOUND. If you buy this buy it cause you like the band but not for the sound. If you want good DTS music buy roy orbison black and white you will love it.
2,Below avarage sound quality and cinematography,"I am a fan of The Beegees so I bought this dvd despite some of the bad critics. Well, unfortunately the critics are true, at least to the Dolby Digital only version I've got. Vocals are weak and instrumental sounds are neither sharp nor clear, with too much noise from the crowd.Video quality is as expected from dvd's but there are just too much zooming and panning from the back of the audience towards the stage that you think you are looking at a home-made video.Also, most of the songs are not full-length, therefore it can be dishearting if you expected otherwise."
2,A Very Disappointing DTS,"I owned a 5.1 digital surround version of this dvd earlier and subsequently I purchased an amplifier with DTS. Because DVDs like ELO's Zoom Tour and Diane Krall's Live In Paris sound marvelously well in DTS I assumed Bee Gees One Night Only would sound equally good. What a disappointment!. The sound engineer did a very bad job indeed. The center channel produces no vocals and the back surround speakers have a very week sound, as well as delayed sound. This dvd does no justice at all to DTS."
2,poor recording,I have both DD and DTS. I found both are poor recorded. Very disappointed. I have CD of Bee Gees from 60 up. The Polydor give very good recording even on the old days. The 1997 concert has very good song and perfomance except recording. This recording is NOT acceptable for a good Hi-Fi equipment.
5,excellent master piece,"rated 5 star's -sound extraordinary,performance-super.If you like the Bee Gees, thsi is the DVD that you are looking for."
5,O What A Night!,"DTS is the best!The digital surroun dound makes it seem as if you're sitting front row center at the MGM Grand Hotel!I love this DVD Because the Gibb brothers sing songs spanning the group'ss whole career-from the 60's to the Disco Era to thei latest hit.They pay tribute to Andy with one song.The Bee Gees sing ""Immortality""with Celine Dion.This is like""The Bee Gees:The Record""only better!The brothers give and electric Performance.This is a must for any Bee Gees fan!"
5,BEES GEES...forever,"It's all here folks...All the hits, sounds of Vegas, Live and great cinema...GET It."
5,"one night only ""Bee Gees """,The DVD I purchased was in perfect playing condition. I could not be happier with it. Thanks so much!!!
4,What Audio Problem On DTS?,"Bought this more for my wife.Back in the day, when the Bee Gees played, I countered with Led Zeppelin and Van Halen.They did grow on me, but I was never a 'disco' fan.This DVD is good.I've got a fat Yamaha Amp, and Polk Audio Left, Center, Right speakers and a Velodyne subwoofer.The audio production sounds very good.The entire production is good.Even if the Bee Gees are not your favorite (I fall in this group), it's a nice video to put on.Four Stars, 5 if I was a BeeGees fan.Note: If this does not sound right on your stereo, you need to tune your amp. Most modern amps are highly tunable, like Yamaha."
5,Essential history of the Wiregrass area of South Georgia,"Mark Wetherington spent many years preparing this work, first as his PhD and then as a publication for general consumption. As the previous reviewer notes, it shows its academic origins, which to my mind strengthens its authenticity and its dead-on description of the evolution of this area following the Civil War.Knowing Mr. Wetherington personally, this reader recognizes many of his personal asides throughout the book. All of these personal observations serve his narrative well.For anyone interested in this little-known historical area will be in for a treat. Get this book!"
1,surprising but amazing,"As a fluteplayer of my own im amazed about albums sensitive touch to the fragile but musical, ""artistic"" sound to the instrument.I always consider the person behind the music and matt is something very funny but glad in making IT."
1,Boring,"I originally bought this to become familiar with the cockpit procedures of the C-130 to enhance my Flight Simulator experience. While there are a few moments that are worth viewing, I wish I hadn't spent the money on it. It basically boils down to a home movie of Alaska by air. And not very well done. EVERY trip is the same, a take off, some snowy footage, and a landing. Almost no narration. At least the airports could have been described. Not what I thought it was. Disappointed"
1,From an atheist: Blatant Subjectivism and Misrepresentation,"I would not recommend this book to anyone. The author misrepresents atheism and also religion. Le Poidevin is also an outright subjectivist as is shown by entertaining the ideas of ""Why something rather than nothing?"" and ""Possible Worlds"" to name just a few.I would recommend George Smith's ""Atheism, The Case Against God"" instead. Smith takes on most of the same questions, but in a much more straight forward, to the point, objective way."
5,waffle snacks,These waffle snacks have been unavailable FOREVER. WHEN & where can we get these????they are delish!!! WE want more...
1,NO STARS HERE.,"Product arrived with box open and missing product. What was there was stale and crumbled in small pieces. Bags were sealed and intact, but product was worthless. I complained to Amazon but they told me food products are not elegible for refunds. Lost $24.00. I can only assume that product was on shelf too long, was poorly handled and even more poorly shipped by Amazon. Would not recommend. Don't waste your money!!"
5,WOW!!!,"If you are able to purchase this album, DO SO! I have heard many recordings of Rossini's overtures and by far, this is the album that must sit on your collection. From the Barber of Seville, to William Tell, each of these overtures are played with such excitement and gusto, that it is impossible to not get lost while listening to this recording. Reiner simply leads the Chicago Symphony in exceptional performances. In each overture, the CSO plays with such energy, vigor, precision, and outstanding musicianship, that they give the perfect blend of wit, humor, and playfulness to each performance. A truly outstanding album, and a must have."
3,good performance; dated recording,"As noted by the other reviewer, this is a five-star performance. In fact, it's the best performance I've heard so far. Unfortunately the recoding is dated. There's some SERIOUS clipping on the peaks, which I find very annoying. This is why I gave it three stars.Don't get me wrong; I don't mind listening to a vintage recording if it's something significant, like Furtwangler conducting Beethoven's 9th at Bayreuth in '51 for example. But why is it that, with a ""warhorse"" like the Rossini overtures, all we have to choose from are lame modern performances that are recorded phenominally well, or classic old performances that are recorded in mud? This is no less than the FOURTH recording of the Rossini overtures that I've purchased, and I'm still looking. Oh well..."
2,No no no...,"Reiner offers driven, humorless, unrelenting performances of this wonderfully playful music. He was a great conductor -- and God knows the Chicago Symphony played magnificently for him -- but this is a classic mismatch."
3,OK,"This is a great idea. The picture is missleading in that the water has to be a lot higher to get the ball up that high. Also, not only does the unit have to be LEVEL, but the wind has to not blow too much or the ball won't stay in the stream.They should really put a level detector on the unit as well as some adjustable feet to help on hill areas. Older kids can have fun hitting the ball as it flies up though."
2,Too basic,"I purchased this DVD because I haven't fish much in years. It was not much help and far to basic. It may be OK for someone who doesn't no anything about fishing but not much new info if you have any knowledge at all about it!It goes a little slow and spends a lot of time on safety ie life jackets, don't go out in a storm, etc. that is not why I purchased this, I purchased it to learn more about fishing!I also purchased the Nearshore Boating & Fishing and When Fish Won't Bite, I wouldn't recomend the three of them, a lot of the same info is repeated on all three such as the same wasted time on all of the safety issues, (a little of that would have been ok but there was quite a lot of time spent on the topic, it seemed like they were just trying to take up time) also the same knots repeated at great length, etc.Maybe for the novice there is some helpful info but in my opinion not much and just not worth the money!"
3,Kindle edition not great,I have the kindle edition of this book. I wanted it so that it would be easier to carry around. The problem is that it is very hard to navigate because there are no chapter markings in it. I would have preferred the physical book version now because I get so frustrated with it!
1,Grill Quality,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BKXE02/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleProblem with Quality of grill.Ordered 1st grill; issues with gritty finish on grill surface left corner & chips/nicks off back edge returned.Shipped replacement #2 grill; issues with gritty finish on grill surface & chips/nicks off right edge, returned.Shipped replacement, 3t grill; issues with gritty finish on grill surface & right handel was broken (probably durring shipment) , returned.Surmising units must be seconds.Prompt shipping & credit.Customer service was great."
2,Nice griddle but Poor performance,"After two uses I have boxed it up to return. Overall the griddle is very nice. Not sure if I have a defective griddle, but it would heat to about 330. Even when it was set at 400. Right before I started to cook 10 strips of bacon I checked the temp and it was 330. After adding bacon the temp dropped to 190 and never got past 250. I was using my laser temp to check. I also checked my laser temp to make sure it was correct by boiling water to verify the temp. I was hoping that this griddle was going to be great, but that was not the case. I am gald amazon has a great return policy."
5,Very Nice Griddle,"My griddle arrived very fast... wasn't due to be delivered till tomorrow and it came today! It is a fantastic griddle with a nice big smooth surface. I've found that at higher temperatures the left side gets about 5 degrees hotter than the right. That is not a problem as most of the time I want more heat anyways. Other than that, this griddle cooks fantastic. Nice even char on burgers and the onions and green peppers were very nicely caramelized. Very nice griddle for the price."
5,Made in USA is worth it,"After putting up with a cheap Presto with a cooking surface directly over the oval heating element for too long, I broke down and bought one of these beauties. I was so totally satisfied that I bought a second one for the cabin. This thing just flat out makes frying a pleasure. All of the things mentioned already; the even heat, the non stick surface, the accurate temperature control, the backsplash and the overall great quality of an American made well engineered product has me delighted. Highly recommended."
3,you only get what you pay for,"cooks great, finish not so good. looks like cheap made in china, sharp rough casting under grill. awful looking non stick coating. wish i bought better american made grill."
2,"A decent grill, not five star!","It is a nice griddle, not sure it was worth what I paid for it, nonstick is a scary thing because it only stays nonstick for so long, one review I read was from someone who didn't like the splatter gaurd, I am in total agreement with this person! The power cord is pretty heavy and likes to go where it wants, the surface heating seemed pretty even, and heated up quick, it'll never replace my old cast iron ever! I have used it once so far and it seemed adiquit enough, I have had a lot of nonstick pans over the years and they were nice as I said before while they lasted, over all a decent product with some good points as well bad ones, I haven't found enough wrong with it to send it back but will use it somewhat conservatively to protect the nonstick surface, would I run off and buy another one absolutly no way, but am going to enjoy this one!"
5,Amazing space!,"We received this as a wedding gift and we saw the good reviews on Cook's Illustrated. It's fantastic and now we can't imagine making pancakes on anything else. Also really good for grilled cheeses and egg-in-a-holes. Heats up fast, evenly cooks, and easy to use controls. It's everything we wanted from a griddle."
1,Avoid,"As others have said about Broil King it came like it had sand under the nonstick coating. The temp is so uneven that I would never try and cook with it. When it said it was at 350F my infrared temp read 468F on the hot side and 279F on the other. I can't believe all the positive reviews I found by so called testing groups . I'm glad I ordered it from Amazon, They take great care of there customers."
2,Broil King PCG-10 Professional Portable Nonstick Griddle Broil King PCG-10 Professional Portable Nonstick Griddle,It had a poor coating job and we returned it. Chose not to have it replaced as it was bigger than what my husband wanted.
2,Broil King PCG-10,I agree with Stephen. The workmanship is very poor. The casting is so rough that you could cut yourself just carrying the grill. My husband filed off the sharp areas. The finish was not uniform. There was a rough patch in the upper left corner that probably won't affect it's performance. I also had trouble inserting the control. Then when I brought the grill up to the recommended temp of 325 for pancakes it seemed to drop way down and didn't maintain 325. The pancakes turned out tan instead of brown. It did OK on the eggs and I didn't have to wait long for it to cool off because it hadn't maintained 325.I would have returned the grill but we had already thrown the box away. Maybe I just got dud.
4,Very happy with purchase after using for a few months.,"Griddle does a fine job of cooking large amounts of food at one time.Works great for browning a dozen Italian sausage links or brats on the front of the surface while peppers and onions are sautéing in the back. Just leave the food on the griddle, turn it on low and you have an easy way to serve your next family get-together or party.Does an excellent job on breakfast food for the whole family (pancakes, French toast, hash browns, eggs, bacon and sausage). I recommend the back-splash but wish it were not so flimsy. There are hot spots though you just learn to use them to your advantage. It has its flaws, the legs don't sit perfectly flat on a surface, but the food comes out great.I've compared every retail griddle I could find from Presto to All-Clad. Commercial griddles cost as much as a stove. For the price ($89), size, and functionality (back-splash) this was the best griddle."
2,A Lemon,"I really like this product and was given a recommendation by my Son & his wife. Unfortunately, I seem to have gotten a LEMON!The griddle itself is good, large and easy to clean. However the electrical Plug-In to the griddle is faulty. It is very loose (and has been from the start) is getting worse and the only way to keep the griddle hot is to hold the plug in manually. I am very disappointed and I think it should be replaced, but I don't want a big hassle. I am thinking of ordering another one, hoping that the same thing doesn't happen again...."
5,Made in the USA and love it,"Yes it cost more than one of those made in China, but I can already tell it last longer and it cooks great."
4,No Complaints,"I do not use the splash guard. There are little plastice pieces you can use to tilt the griddle, but I honestly do not use them either. Like other reviewers, I notice the finish is not smooth and pretty, but I do not care about that. The instructions clearly state one side is hotter than the other, so I do expect that. I learned to work around it! I set the temperature about 10 degrees lower than the recommended for most items and it cooks everything nicely. The temperature control is heavy duty -- which is a nice surprise! Nice thick cord. So far, I really like this. I cook 6 decent size pancakes on it at one time. A whole pound of bacon. I don't know how people cook for a family without a griddle like this!"
5,Can't imagine any improvements.,"A well-thought out product: high grade non-stick surface, tilt-adjusting legs for drainage of fats/oils or flat. Show me ANY heating device that doesn't have hot spots! All cooks understand heat and deal with it, this griddle does not have glaring unevenness hot spots. The plastic drip tray is solid plastic and easy to insert/remove. My only qualm is that for my bigger kitchen that the cord had a little more length to it."
3,BroilKing griddles are all the same,"In searching for information on the BroilKing griddles, I called their customer service line. Basically all of the cooking units (griddle itself) are identical between the Professional, Ultra and 550 models. The only differences are the handles and the backsplash on the PCG10. Given the price difference, it seems the Ultra model is best as the handles on the 550 series are pretty flimsy.Correction: I spoke with customer service again and the information above is wrong. The PCG5 and PCG10 are identical except for the backsplash on the PCG10. The Ultra (USG-10)is a different unit with different thermostat and non stick coating. Sorry for the confusion."
5,Her's The Deal,Nice product. Made well. Heats evenly. Pretty much like other reviews but here's the deal. I ordered this griddle and saw online where it had been delivered. Went out on the porch and no griddle. Looked on the neighbors porch but no griddle. Decided to call Amazon and they jumped all over the problem. The person I spoke with did an excellent job with the situation. We decided to wait a couple of days to make sure it was really lost and at that point Amazon would simply send out a new one. As it turned out another neighbor had it and brought it by. I called Amazon to let them know before they shipped me the replacement. Very happy with the way they responded.
3,BroilKing Pro Gray Griddle With Stainless Handles And Backsplash - PCG-10,"Have used the griddle a couple of times. It seems to work ok,but would not replace our cast iron griddle.I dont know how good the surface will last.My wife loves it so far."
1,Broil King disaster,Well after I pay quite a bit amount of money for this item I was quite dissapointed. I read the instructions because I did not want to mess it up. Light coated with oil and guess what the first time I used burn part of the surface even through I was following temperature instructions per items I were cooking. Try to get it off but did not come up. So indeed I am very dissapointed about this item. My reccomendation is dont get it.
2,Disappointing and Difficult to Listen to!,"While I applaud Douglas Worthen for recording Karg-Elert's flute repertoire, I was very disappointed with the result. His tone is so pithy and fuzzy that I could not hear the delicate chromatic nuances that define Karg-Elert's work. I longed for a firm, relaxed, clear tone (like Aitken's), and became so frustrated with the frothy buzzing and lack of support through the phrases that I had to turn it off! I'm really sorry Mr. Worthen; I don't like to be critical of anyone who puts their best creative efforts out there for public scrutiny, but I was very disappointed with this performance. There is not a lot to choose from when it comes to Karg-Elert's flute compositions - I'd welcome other suggestions!"
1,No more Swissgear for me!,"I bought a set of Swissgear soft-sided, upright, wheeled luggage with hide-away retractable handles, (but not from Amazon). One is 27 to 28 inch, the other is 25 to 26 inch. The exterior fabric is wearing very well and looks good. The zippers are well made. The problem with both suitcases is their semi-rigid plastic interior full frame/liner to which the retractable handle assembly, wheels and exterior fabric attach. This plastic is falling apart like a brittle, dried clay sheet. (It appears to be decomposing.) Obviously, without this plastic structure, the rest of the suitase is no longer usable. For me, no more Swissgear! What a waste of money!"
3,It's disappointing,"I am an admirer of The Sheik. From the title, I expected that all bouts in it are The Sheik's. However as for his match, the video has included only one (The Sheik VS Bobo Brazil), and that it is only a few minutes. a few minutes."
3,Cake pan,The size was too small for what we needed. Other then that I like it. Wish it came in a 12 or 15 cup.
4,good pan,Nice heavy pan out of cast aluminum. Only thing my wife did not like was the dezign did not come all the way to the bottom of the cake.
5,Love to bake? Go for it.,"This pan makes a terrific cake, but a little smaller than what I would like. But a great item to have in your kitchen. Would recommend to anyone who loves to bake."
5,Makes the prettiest cake!,"I love this pan, it makes the coolest cake! I saw it on the cover of a southern living magazine, very impressive!"
1,GOOD AT FIRST,"This makes a beautiful cake and released with ease at first. After time, and after ruining four cakes, I threw it out. No matter how much I prepped it, it would not release the cake. Buyer beware."
5,worth the money,Product arrived on time. Only used the pan twice both times cakes came out perfect. Used Pam Baking spray and the cakes just slid out of the pan. Nothing stuck to the pan and the clean up was easy.
5,beautiful results,"This pan will give you the most beautiful results. The cakes bake so evenly, with a lovely color. A cake made from scratch is the only way to go,mixes don't give you the right crumb. A chocolate cake, with a dusting of confectioner's sugar defining the grooves, makes an elegant presentation."
3,BUNDT PAN TOO SMALL,"ALTHOUGH i LOVE THE DESIGN OF THE BAVARIA BUNDT PAN, I WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THE SIZE. THE PAN SEEMED TOO SMALL FOR MY BASIC CAKE RECIPES. BECAUSE THE PAN WAS TOO SMALL THE CAKE DID NOT BAKE WELL."
5,Great Bake,My very first cake in this heavy-duty Bundt Pan turnes out exquistily as I had hoped . It was a good deal
4,Nordic Ware Platinum Series Nonstick Bundt Pan,I like to bake. good weight. suggest a light spry before use. works very well.
5,If you want a sophisticated cake ...,"This pan offers the high quality of the Nordic Ware cake pans. Be aware there are cheaper versions of this pan that are sold, they are not cast Aluminum. So they do not bake as well as this heavier pan does. This pan really produces the design well, and it produces it everytime. I always like to grab this cake pan, when bringing a cake to someone. It makes it look like you went to so much more effort than what it really takes to make a cake."
4,Makes a Good Looking Cake!,"I hesitated when ordering this cake pan. I feared that half the cake would still be in the pan when it was removed but it turned out GREAT! No frosting needed! But if you do want to frost it, mix up some powdered sugar with lemon juice until smooth. Make sure mixture is a bit thin. Drizzle mixture over the cake slowly, paying attention to where the crevices are so the mixture will run down the crevices of the cake. Let it sit for about 20 minutes and clean up the excess around the cake plate. It makes a beautiful easy presentation. I gave it 4 stars because for some reason, I thought it would be a little bigger than pictured, so my cake was not as large as I would have liked it to be."
3,Read for Linda Howard.,"I agree with the reviewer who said read Lake of Dreams and ditch the rest. I've never been fond of Linda Lael Miller and her short story in this just reaffirmed that for me. Also, for the Lake of Dreams story, buy it in the Everlasting Love Collection. It's cheaper."
3,Lake of Dreams,"If you want the book for the Linda Howard story (Lake of Dreams) you're better off getting Strangers in the Night. It has Lake of Dreams, Whiteout, and Blue Moon, all by Howard. I really enjoyed Lake of Dreams and highly recommend it."
5,Well Crafted,This is a short story that speaks louder than many full length novels. Beautiful fiction. Read and enjoy!
1,Save your $$ - Re-issue,"While I REALLY liked the stories contained in this book - I was disappointed to discover this was a reissue of stories previously issued in the book ""Everlasting Love"". ""Everlasting"" included two additional stories although it was issued in 1995. Good marketing ploy however."
5,Alternate History - Eat your heart out!,"In a world where the Confederacy survived the war, things are as complex as ever in the 20th century.McKenna Alexander finds this out for herself as her ex-husband is first rumored to be part of an assassination plot against a recently released civil rights activist, and she ends up turning up dead.Going after Cullen in an attempt to save her job and find out the truth, she goes on a roller coaster ride of intrigue, passion, murder, and rekindled love.Awesome read! Great details and world building! You get info from all sides for a nice 360 degree view of the plot and all the years and facts leading up to this great clash. If you've ever even toyed with the idea of reading alternate history, this book is for you!"
5,Great Blues Teacher,"I have been playing for over 35 years, taught and played professionally. This book is the real deal. If you want a book that will show you riffs and how to put them together then this is it. The riffs are arranged in 2 bar phrases that are sections of the the 12 bar blues form. You can pretty much use any 2 bar phrase in conjunction with any combination of 5 other 2 bar phrases to make a solo. You will play these 2 bar phrases and say to yourself, I have heard that riff and now I am playing it. This is not beginner stuff that merely runs up and down the blues or pentatonic scales, these are real phrases that you have heard on CDs. Buy this book if you want to really learn to play the blues!!"
4,Great learning tool,"This book does just what it says on the box! No complications. It breaks down a simple 12 bar blues and provides plenty of 2 bar riff ideas that you can use over the backing tracks. Tracks are simple slow blues in E, A and G [2 of each] and each about 4+ minutes long. It's a great learning tool and worth buying just for these jam tracks."
3,Entry level,"Well for all the stuff I read about it and thought it might turn out to be... this turned out to just about ok. I was looking for licks and this has licks that can be memorised and reissued and re used. But it stops at just phrases and at time is actually monotonous...If you want to get a quick bunch of licks that are at best average, get this book and CD.Else you're better off with some of the other tutorials which are more intelligent."
1,Just another riff book,"After reading the reviews and looking at a pile of riff books I already owned and never used it sounded like this one would be different. No way--same ol' same ol. I was especially disappointed with some of these riffs being so short. My ideal would be riffs that comprise more than 10-15 notes. It may be my bias that I do not find riff books to be that useful. The idea of working on and memorizing 70 very short riffs and then somehow stringing them together--10-15 notes at a time does not appeal to me. My bias, I guess. If you like riff books, fine but do not expect this one to offer anything more than others."
5,Great Stuff,"I have been playing for a short amount of time, 4 years, so this book has a lot of examples that are too difficult for me. However, for the ones that I can handle, they are fantastic. They sound great. Even when I play them....As for the ones that are too difficult, some are reachable with some effort. I spent a lot of time on Example 13 and after a few weeks, I was close. I used freeware on the internet to slow the speed down and finally got to about 80% speed. The riffs sound so great, I am motivated to practice every night to try and re-produce the sound. These licks are very professional. Not some wanna be on youtube pretending to know what he/she is doing. I highly recommend this book. My only complaint is that I wish there were some fingering suggestions. That would make some of them easier to play. I have to experiment and it takes extra time to do this. Maybe if I were a bit more advanced, it would be more obvious."
5,Great Blues Book with Solid Riffs!,"This one is great! Unlike many blues books that contain things you would never play and that you never hear anyone else play, this book is filled with interesting, catchy riffs that sound like your favorite blues artist is layin' it down. Of all the ""blues riff"" books I have bought (probably 20), this is the one that has helped my lead playing the most. It is simple, direct, and filled with good licks. Buy it and don't look back!"
2,can't get all this hype,"this is a good licks book, but a few warning must be made. The licks are all played with the same backing track, at the same tempo,same time signature, a slow blues piece of music. The explanations of scales used are two pages long, and confusing, as most books. The rest is tab, purely tab.If you think you'll find different licks for different blues progressions, you'll be disappointed.The licks are categorized in bars of the 12 bar blues, but that doesn't mean you'llknow when to improvise licks, because unless your are a natural born talent, you will need a little theory for that, something you won't find here.Anyway, you'll get many licks from the book, just don't expect to be the bible people are claiming.When the book arrived, I was like ""what about those glowing reviews?"""
4,Good riffs to incorporate,"Good book. You must have prior playing experience or some of it won't make sense. Overall, a good learning tool for a player trying to understand the blues."
3,Too short..but OK,"Treat this book as an introduction to blues licks and pentatonic progressions. It is a nice starter, without much of a theory. Later you may try ""Guitar Aerobics"" and ""Blues You Can Use""."
1,1 Star was generious with this Rag !,"I wish I could have examened this Rag before I purchased it. Weak Blues bars, poor Riff's. Over all a poor choise for a serious blues guitar player."
5,Orig Cast of How to Succeed Gives the '95 Cast the Business,"Matthew Broderick is a nice guy... a very capable actor with an endearing smile, but he pales in comparison to the raw, natural talent of Robert Morse. The engaging personality and sheer energy that Morse gives to HTSIB propels this original recording to heights the '95 remake could only dream about.Some detractors have harped on the lack of ""CD quality"" on this 60's recording. Well, these are the same folks who prefer Citizen Kane colorized. All I can say is this is the real McCoy, a glittering star-studded show from the golden age of Broadway, not some rebaked retro. It remains a joy to listen to and be entertained by."
5,Minor historical note,"Patty, above, refers to this CD as ""H2$,"" but actually that abbreviation was first used in advertising for the 1995 revival (for example, in giant letters on stage behind the peformance on the Tony awards show). The abbreviation used for the original was actually ""HTSIBWRT."" (Note that the revival's producers probably had a good idea in shortening it.) However you abbreviate it, though, I'd agree with most everyone above that HTSIBWRT is a great CD. You'll love it! (Alhtough I'd argue that the H2$ CD is equally enjoyable.)"
3,H2$ was a great show with a great score!,"H2$ was an awesome show to do. I had a lot of fun with it. I heard this recording briefly so we could have an idea what we were doing for the show. I thought it was good, but to tell you the truth, I think our cast did better than this CD, but then again they did the CD so who am I to say we were better, if they got a record done. Well anyway, the songs in this show are very funny. It is a very satirical show, you laugh, you cry, it's great!"
1,OUCH!!!,"This recording is a realy loser! I wish I would have bought the Matthew Broaderick (spell?) version when I had the chance! DON""T BUY THIS RECORDING! It is awful! The 1960's cast just doesn't give this show the fun and ""umff"" that this show needs. Get the 1995 Cast!"
2,Disapointing,"This musical may be very attactive to american audiences. However, approached from abroad, it sounds quite uninteresting and dull. The music said nothing to me, being hard to find one single attractive melody. According to the records, 1962 was not really fortunate for the Broadway musical. The plays nominated for the Tony were not really brilliant. And this musical made it. As the proberb says: ""In the land of the blind, the cross-eyed is the King""..."
5,BEST BAD MOVIES EVER!,"this package of Plan 9/ Robot Monster is GREAT!Excellently transferred to DVD. The added bonus of the documentary of ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"", is fascinating. See Ed Wood directing in rare film clips.""Plan 9""(I guess the first 8 failed) is very fun , and amazingly inept. But Wood, bless his big heart, was sincere and honest, and a bit naive......and the result is one of history's most hilariously bad movies, ever. But very entertaining.As far as ""Robot Monster"" goes......you have to see the hairy beast with the diving-helmet with the TV antennae and the soap bubbles and the flavin........he just wiped out all of the entire race except for a few survivors, who just happen to live a few yards from his cave.yes, the acting, script,and special effects stink, but at least the direction is horrible! this movie is hilarious, and very entertaining.So.....a great double feature for you big kids out there!"
5,The best worst movies,"These two movies are classics in the best ""worst"" B movies. We laughed from beginning to the end on both of them."
2,**facepalms**,I remember this film from my youth.....I just don't remember it being this bad.Good thing there is a decent two man male stripper scene which runs for several minutes near the front of this very sophomoric film.This film is the cinema version of riding in a shopping cart which has been shoved over the edge of a cliff.
2,worse than Troll 2,"Party Animal is a truly horrible movie despite a few scenes that make it ""watchable"" (and I use that term lightly). If not for the awesome soundtrack, the role by Jerry Jones, several nude scenes, and creepy/hilarious homo-erotic tendencies, I'd declare this movie unfit for anyone. Watch at your own risk unless you're into this type of movie, but at the cheap price it's not like you'll break the bank."
3,It is supposed to be brainless fun,I saw this movie when I was stationed in Germany in the late '80s. If you are hoping to learn a life lesson from this movie like another reviewer then don't buy it. This movie is purely an immature escape. There is nothing wrong with that and I can see there are a few people out there that could really use it.Very funny movie with an outstanding sound track!
2,"Goofy, predictable 1980s film","If you like the Porky's series and other 1980s films where male main characters struggle and succeed at losing their virginity, then you will like this. It is a bit of ""the nerd finally gets his."" Still, it has predictable jokes. It's really just for people who want to see a lot of female nudity. There is a token black guru in the film. He does say a phrase that may stay with you for a while. Near the end there is a stereotypical gay character that is only there for homophobic audiences. This film was made before there was a broadscale outcry against displays of the confederate flag. The unthoughtful display of that item may upset modern viewers. Face it, this film is not for people who watch the Oscars. It is very much meant for immature watchers like the main character."
4,Got to love Pondo!!,"This is a fun, cheesy, 80's flick, that you'll either love or hate. I love it and was so happy to see that it was available through Amazon!! So thank you sooo much! This is a movie my brother and I used to watch when we were younger, so to watch it again was so great. And it has such a great soundtrack. If you love 80's music, you'll enjoy it as well. Give this movie a chance...it's so stupid it's funny!!!"
4,Almost as funny as i remembered it,"Granted, this is not classic film making; it is low budget and looks it. I saw this film while in high school years ago, and loved it. Then it fell off the radar. I always checked to see if it was available, but could never find it. Suddenly, there it is on dvd. I bought to show friends who had never heard of it, and we got together and laughed our heads off. If you like silly comedy and don't mind a bare breast or two, you will like this film."
4,Still a source of laughs...,"I saw this movie during my college years in the late 80's... it was funny then, and is still a hoot after all this time. Shared it with my buddies who never saw it before and they howled at some of the bits..."
4,Hilarious!,"It's cheesy...it's dumb...it's your typical 80's college guy flick. In other words, it's great. Who doesn't want to get laid? Who hasn't had those times where they can't seem to do anything right when it comes to the opposite sex? This is a VERY tongue in cheek look at our boy Pondo 'Hound Dog' Sinatra, a college student who just wants a piece. Gotta love it!!"
2,A Must See?,"This movie is a must see for any guy who had women problems growing up. Though extreme, the movie shows the lengths a guy will go to pick up some chicks. I saw this movie in high school at the theater, and thought it was one of the funniest films I saw in an endless line of similar plots, topless women, and low budget films residing in the where are they now file. This film is just funny. I have several friends that I see about once every 3 years who still quote it. This film should have been lifted into cult status, but I don't think enough people have seen it, one thing is sure, if you find a guy who did see it, they will remember it fondly.Not a good film to watch with a female, or your children. Not really all that bad, but I have figured out that most middle aged women do not want to view topless women from the 80's."
2,Girlfriends,some of the DVDs would freeze I have cleaned my dvd player and put in other dvds put tthse keep freezing I am disatisfied with the quality of the dvd
5,Can't Wait,I have been waiting for the release of the DVD Series. Congrats! Girlfriends on your success. I watch the reruns over and over!
5,My prayers were answered...,"I know that may sound a bit dramatic when relating to a television show. However, I have been waiting for this series to become available on DVD for quite some time. I watched other silly shows that were cancelled after two seasons become available on DVD and wondered why Girlfriends after 7 seasons was not available to the fans. I'm glad that they finally got it together and released it so that I can laugh, and enjoy the episodes over and over again."
5,CLASSIC,OMG I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS SHOW. =0) EVERYONE SHOULD OWN A COPY OF GIRLFRIENDS. CAN'T WAIT FOR THE RELEASE OF THE SECOND SEASON.
3,Simply marvelous!!,"I finally got the Girlfriends DVD delivered, and love it. I just want to know when will the other seasons be available? The last scene from the 4th disc was shocking to me, and I need to know what happens in the second season. I know that they remain friends, I just want to know how the whole thing went down when Joan saw what she saw.Great DVD, looking forward to the other ones...."
4,Girlfriends,Not a fan of this show...I think it's rip off of Living Single....the characters Toni and Mya sicken me...especially Toni(UGH!....ugly and has the nerve to be stuck up on and off screen) But my mom loves it and it was a gift for her. She thinks it great and I think it made a great gift.
2,Girlfriends first season,"I am one of the biggest ""Girlfriends"" fans. Although it has not been DVD yet i have seen the whole first season on TV and from my prospective it was one of the worst season of the show so far, because it was a brand new show and the story lines were not so intresting. The hiar, mackeup, wardrobe, and dialog was really off and the little ""Joan"" moments where every thing pauses and joan has a on camere thought in hear head was really the worst part. although in my opinion the first season was the worst, I WOULD STILL BUY THIS DVD because wonce the sales of this set goes well it will give Paramount the green light to release the other seasons, (witch were way better) you see how long it took for the studio to even consider to release the show on DVD. The show is now in its 7th year as one of the longest runnig Upn shows ever. It now continues on The CW."
5,"Great show, great writing","I discovered Girlfriends in syndication, and once I did I became totally hooked (too bad Toni's gone--she was the best!). This is a grown folks show. I like that the women are professional, classy and portrayed in a postive light (Well, Lynn is debatable. She's a little too unfocused and ""free"" for my taste). I also like that the men they date are MEN and not boys in grown men's bodies like a lot of sitcoms these days. Girlfriends explores topics relevant to today such as sexuality, economic empowerment, politics, marriage and dating. And even though these are 4 black women, I know women of all races can relate to what these characters experience. Girlfriends cares about telling great stories and don't always go for the laughs (although there are plenty of those). It is just excellent writing and in the end we can't ask for more than that."
5,VICTORY IS OURS!,I called UPN (before it turned to the CW) almost every day and wrote email after email asking them to release the show on dvd and that by doing so it would make millions of fans around the world happy. After awhile I gave up because I kept getting the run around over the phone and stopped getting a reply from the emails I was sending. Then two days ago out the blue I decided to check out the website and to my surprise they finally decided to release it. I like to think that I (along with many other fans I'm sure) had a little something to do with this phenomenon. At last my fellow Girlfriends fans...victory is ours!
5,A Show I Can Finally Relate Too,"I am so thrilled that Girlfriends is finally out on DVD. Why did it take so long for this to happen? Being stationed in Iraq, and not having the opportunity to get Girlfriends on DVD was a real bummer. I am sure I will be ordering more copies to send to my overseas friends."
1,NOT LONG ENOUGH!!!!,"The tie case is about 2 inches too short - my ties (which are Zegna, Hermes and Ferragamo) do not fit lengthwise (when folded appropriately), so they pop out of the bottom and I cannot close the zipper.Also, the strap that holds the ties in is very taut and so it pinches my ties.Both of these make a very beautiful and well made item almost useless to use."
5,Great sheets!,I bought these sheets for my 13 year old son. He really likes them and they are very soft and wash up well. A good quality sheet for the money.
4,Works great! Excellent customer service.,"I needed a good component video switch since my TV only has one set that provides 1080i support. Also needed something that would work with a Logitech Remote. Found the Nyrius SW201, read the reviews, and am happy to report it does exactly what I need and performs great. I see no degradation on the video signal and hear no difference in audio.Only glitch with the product was that the included remote would not switch to input 1. Contacted support and they sent a new remote within a few days."
2,Works... kind of.,"This switch will allow you to increase the number of HD component devices you can use. However, this convenience comes at a drawback. The picture and sound often black out for several seconds when using this device. It mostly happens during commercials but sometimes happens during actual shows/movies. It also happens occasionally while using my PS3, both for gaming or watching movies. I think the blackouts are caused when the video quality switches as it usually happens when the camera angle switches. Also, it does not appear to happen on standard definition channels. I tested different cables to make sure that was not the issue. I requested a replacement device and found the same problems in the second device. I hope I can get a refund because the blackouts are quite annoying."
5,Good Quality at a Good Price,My television only came with two component inputs and I had four things to input. hmmmmmm what to do?..Hooray Shoptronics to the rescue. This selector switch works great and the remote control means I don't have to get out of my easy chair to switch between inputs.I also like the fact you can turn the power Off/On via the remote.This Switch was exactly what I needed and I highly recomend it to anyone.
5,Works just as described,"When Panasonic didn't offer an HDMI after-market circuit board for slot 1 on my 50"" plassma, 8 series I ordered one of these switchers to get three component inputs. This unit works wonderfully well and over the 3 months that I've used it (daily) it has been totally as described and trouble free--including the remote. It is much cheaper than the recently released Panasonic circuit board, and is actually better than the HDMI circuit board as I send separate audio into a high-end receiver (and not into the TV).casual Kaz"
4,NYRIUS COMPONENT VIDEO SWITCH,"Item was shipped quickly and works exactly as expected. Easy to connect and use. My only complaintits the size of the remote control. Very small and easy to misplace, altough I have been lucky so far"
2,Worked great for the first 10 months,"Worked flawlessly with my components including my Harmony One remote. Nevertheless, after 10 months the optical outputs stopped working (channel 2 then channel 3). I tried different cables to no avail… In the end, the little box is now collecting dust. Too bad, I really liked what it could do when it worked."
5,Component Video Switcher,This product was a great solution for our situation. The remote control was especially helpful as our system was able to learn the command to control the switcher from another room. The produst was very reliable and we had no issues installing it.
3,Had some problems with it...,"The switch had some problems when connecting 3 products together (Streamer, XBox, TV converter).The streamer that was connected showed some lines and the quality was not perfect,When only 2 products were connected everything was fine.For me it was enough as I only needed 2 products to connect together, but for those of you who need it to support 3 products simultaneously it could be problematic.I gave it a 3/5."
5,I have to be sincere,"I bought this product because my HD tv only have one component input so it was kind frustrating changing everytime I want to see a movie because I have a Wii, a dvd player and another electronic device. So I bought it and recieved it three days later, is very small box also very lightweight. to install this switch box I just have to plug the cables! and conect it to the HD tv and it works prefectly also have its own remote control that make the things easier for you!PS: you have to buy the component cable separately."
4,Second one works well,"I ordered this device because it would work with my Harmony easily and was getting decent reviews.The first one I recieved would switch the video fine but the optical was not working at all. I sent it back and received a new unit. All is working well now. I haven't changed my harmoney because of time but I have no doubt it will work since the remote it comes with works just fine.Would have received 5 stars if the first unit I bought had worked out of the box.I am using it with a Tivo Series 3, Sony s360 Bluray, and an Onkyo Digital Receiver to an older Philips Projection Screen HDTV."
5,It made me smile!,"This is a book that brought back a great deal of memories for me. Brian's descriptions of his altar boy days, the priests, the tales of Garrison and Frank Rizzo sent me back to another day and time. I once again became that little girl in the fourth grade with an incredible crush (and a cracker jack ring). His own personal story of his pain as a parent dealing with his son's illness, to the joy of teaching a Sunday school class about faith, left me feeling that I wanted to hear more. Thanks, Brian, for reminding me of just what life is really all about! T.O'K."
3,"Eh, Its alright","This is a very nice gun for someone new to airsoft. However, it is not practical at all. Bb's drop after about 10 feet, and there is no way to adjust the hop up. also, it doesnt have a semi fire mode. For a begginer gun its very nice though, because it doesnt hurt at close range, and also the battery is very easy to charge and lasts a long time. The included flashlight is pretty nice as well."
1,"Awful, just Awful","when i first got this in the mail, i realized it was a piece of junk. Its the well D-90h, the worst airsoft gun in the world. their is no adjustable hop up, when you fire, only 50% of the BBs come out and when they do, they shoot about 10 feet and drop to the ground. My friends laughed at me when i showed it to them. Please do not buy this gun. I would recommend the crosman r76 tatical this gun is way better.Michael,"
5,wynonna judd-her story,I was very touched by her concert which is this cd. she puts her soul and her spirit into all of her songs. One song almost had me in tears because she makes you feel her words. She is a must see in concert.
2,"They Should Tell You It Is ""LIVE""","Should've read the other reviews before purchasing tracks. I HATE ""recorded live"" music - the noise and screaming of ""fans"" just ruins a song for me. If I knew how to get am MP3 refund from Amazon, I'd ask for one!"
1,Wynona: Her Story,I regret this purchase. Wynona talks before every song for a minute or longer. I would neverrecommend this cd.
5,Love Wynona,"I always love listening to Wynona and these CD's are no exception.Especially enjoy her rendition of ""I Want To Know What Love Is"""
5,A great compilation!,Very enjoyable CD. Great songs and stories by Wynonna. The 2nd CD is Wynonna singing many great songs by other artists.
5,20 Years and still going on strong,"Wynonna's live album is a treat for listeners. This two disc live set chronicles her journey of 20 years in country music. From early hits as a member of the Judds, to her solo hits, to inspired covers, Wynonna does it all! It's great to hear her fine voice as usual, but it's also nice to hear the intimate stories she tells between songs. The stories are personal and the music is passionate. Highlights include cover songs like ""I'm The Only One"", ""The Best"", and classic hits like ""Is It Over Yet"", ""Love Is Alive"", ""To Be Loved By You"", etc. Also is a new track she wrote with John Rich called ""Attitude"". Great live set!"
2,Big Voice Drowned In A Sea of Noise,"If you don't mind several screaming, whooping women in the front rows intruding on the music at almost every turn, this one's for you. I found the audience sounds so obnoxious and downright loud, it made it hard to get through this CD. The crowd doesn't even shut up during the ballads, ruining the most intimate moments. I love Wynonna's singing, and there are some fine performances here, and many great songs, but this is the worst engineered live album I've ever heard (although audience noise is inevitable and even welcome, as part of the listening experience, here it is almost as loud as the music - not good). Maybe the DVD would have been the way to go; the CD was a huge disappointment, as far as pure listening pleasure is concerned. I doubt if I will ever play this CD straight through a second time, and that's a pity. If you're a big fan of Wynonna, as I am, consider yourself warned!"
5,Hats off to Wynnona,"WOW, this is an awsome collection. If you didn't know much about her personally you will after listening to these CDs. Very moving, very powerful...definitely a must have."
2,Her Story: Scenes From a Lifetime,"I put buying this Cd off for awhile, I am a fan of Wynonna, But what really turned me OFF about the whole cd is before every song she has to BRAG about herself, and how hot she is, I don't understand why she needs to do that????? Dear Wy, You haven't had a No.1 song since 1994 nor a top 10 single since 1994, ""Get Over Yourself"", that was a total turn off for me, I'm not saying she should not have had a No.1 song or even a top 10 song in recent years, I blame that on Country radio, since they turned their backs on the true country artists and choose to play Kiddie/ Cookie cutter/ Crap 'so called country music"", This collection would have been great without all the self bragging, it just turned me off all together Sorry"
1,Do Not Buy,Do not pay for this book. This book can be obtained free of charge through AUSA. It should not be sold. It is a non profit book written by my mom.
4,Good buy,"The guide is excellent to carry in the field, it is of course only a guide and must be backed by using more detailed text books later. Pity it took over two weeks to be delivered, arriving just the day before I left Vancouver."
4,Inspirational and Sobering,"Great book about a great woman. If your not familiar with the Puritans, its a great introduction. If you haven't read about Anne Bradstreet before, its a great introduction to her also. Wilson applauds her where many have not and uses his knowledge of Christianity, his faith which happens to be hers also, to pull out many characteristics of Anne's life. Wilson compliments her and challenges Christians simultaneously. At times, Wilson's writing style was lacking in my opinion but I have to realize that this is the format of the series of books, not Wilson's fault. Wilson does have a blunt, to the point, writing style in general which is obvious from his other books. Some may not like this fact, others will appreciate his no non-sense attitude. He and Anne together will certainly not waste your time."
1,The Poet Got Left Behind,"The author seems unable to stay on topic for very long. In his determination to associate Anne Bradstreet with all of his views, he abandons any chance to help us understand and appreciate her worthwhile body of work.Wilson constantly harps and carps about the bad rap given to the Puritans. Even when I agree that certain common statements about the Puritans are unfair and incorrect, I am put off by his pompous tone.Skip this one. Go straight to ""The Works of Anne Bradstreet"" (Harvard University Press) to get a good dose of a fine poet."
3,"Interesting, but flawed","An interesting yet flawed account of Holmes tracking Jack The Ripper, with Ellery Queen added to the mix. Not a terrible pastiche, mind you, but it pales when compared to the wonderful non-Ellery Queen film version that stars John Neville as Holmes. So check out the film first, if you can track it down. And then, if you're so inclined, try the book."
5,I love these crackers!!!,"These are fantastic crackers from England. Very thick and have a pleasing toasty bread flavor. All natural ingredients.I grew up with these in Newfoundland, Canada, and now that I live in Indiana I can't find them anywhere."
4,Oneida hsotess set,"I got the order in the alloted time,and in good condition.The product was as expected."
5,Big T/A Fan!!,Bought this for my son but really was for me!! Lol The car has great detail to it. Next time I think I'll order the larger scale.
2,early Peter Falk movie..,"A man begins to investigate on his own the death of his brother, who died from eating a hamburger laced with ground glass. With the police case stalled because of ineptness, the man's own investigation leads him toward a beatnik hang-out frequented by Nico (Peter Falk), a shady character who supplies drugs to the patrons and philosophizes about the ills of the world."
3,Florence,"While a lot of sights are viewed in this video, it would be better if more time were spent on the city and its surroundings rather than a hotel room. More in-depth coverage of sights (even if not in complete detail) would allow one to better appreciate the beauty of this city."
5,divvydivv from sc,this batbag is awesome. i have room for all my stuff. this is the best batbag i have ever owned
5,Finnaly found it,We bought our laminate from Office Depot and need replacement film. They no longer sell it and said it was not available and we would have to buy a new laminate.This solved our problem and was what we needed
4,Ekseptional Reunion,"Although billed as the third Trace album, this is really the first Ekseption reunion album. Jaap van Eik, Ian Mosely and Pierre van der Linden (of Trace) do not appear, while Cor Dekker, Peter de Leewe and Dick Remelinck (of Ekseption) do appear. The sound is unsurprisingly closer to 'Ekseption 3' and 'Beggar Julia's Timetrip' than the ELP-influenced Trace.Shortly after this release (1976) the ersatz Ekseption, which had been continuing with Hans Jensen in place of Rick van der Linden, would change their name to Spin, and Rick would reunite with his former bandmates, reclaim the name and release 'Ekseption '78.' Got that???Ekseption was always Rien van den Broek's band more than Rick's, although Rick became such a major element of their sound that they weren't really Ekseption without him. Of course Trace wasn't Ekseption either without the horn section of Rein and Dick."
5,A Pleasant First Review,"This story was a rather good one to me, the way a typical story should go, a bad guy, the helpless first victims,the at first clueless good guy but then he always destroys the evil one. And that is exactly how it goes with the evil step mother (Aoife) jealous of how much time her new husband (King Lir) spends with his kids instead of her so he turns her into swans! But that is all I can tell you, I don't want to ruin the ending but let me say I think they need a NEW ending."
5,Great Puritan Book,"I agree, every professing Christian should read this book and then pass it on. This is one of my favorite Puritan Paperbacks that is out there. This is a rare topic within todays watered down messages."
3,Advertising misleading,"This title indicates a books that is about selling using Goldmine software.Actually, it is about selling.The title of the book is ""Selling: Building Partnerships""It has nothing to do with Goldmine software, ACT software or any Customer Relationship Management software.The book itself is quite comprehensive and an excellent buy at the $10-$15 price range."
2,Smells fine - WAY too strong,"This was a blind buy for me (never do that with perfumes/cologne)The scent actually isn't bad, but one little spray and you'll still be smelling it after your next shower.It's so strong that after a couple hours I get a bit nauseous.If you're taking a trip & can't bring cologne with you, just squirt this stuff about 3 times before the trip and it should last all week."
4,Not as good as regular Joop! But still a great cologne!,"A previous reviewer said he thought it was too strong. I don't beleive that to be with case with me. It for sure doesn't last as long on me as regular JOOP! does, but it does have some decent staying power."
3,If you have Poison Arrow...,"Although this DVD is very good, it is the exact same one as Poison Arrow, just a different cover and title. If you don't have either, then I would recommend this."
5,Plates with spice!,I love my beautiful plates decorated with Latin spice! I use them daily & they always make me smile! Ay yi yi!
3,Arch Hall's Second Best Movie,"Maybe ""Deadwood '76"" isn't on par with a John Ford production, but I thought it was pretty good. The story is a cut above your run of the mill horse opera, and Arch does a decent job portraying Billy May, a cowboy who gets sucked into the gunfighter lifestyle reluctantly. The side stories involving his father's relationship with a soon to be hostile band of Sioux Indians was also pretty different and effective. Don't go into this one expecting ""Eegah!"" type laughs, or ""Sadist"" like chills, but give it a shot if you enjoy westerns. If I'm not mistaken this was the last film Arch made before leaving Hollywood behind in favor of a career in aviation, so if you are an Arch Hall Jr. fan, then you owe it to yourself to own Arch's swan song."
4,Needs a better release,"This is a movie that turns out better than the sum of its parts. The acting is wooden in a lot of places but Arch is pretty good. It's unpredictable in several places and overall I liked it - except for the painful warbling ""Ballad Of Billy"". Where are the music rights clearance nazis when you really need them?This movie does cry out for a decent widescreen release."
2,Use Too Much and it Ruins Negatives,I ruined several 1950's 3x3 film negatives that I wanted to clean prior to sending them out to be scanned and printed. Unfortunately several negatives had difficult-to-remove stains; it seemed that using a little too much on a clean cloth left rub marks that couldn't be removed. It made the negatives worse than what they were. I ended up cleaning the rest of the negatives with warm water and a little mild soap which did a far superior cleaning job. Use this product with great care!
3,Beware of packaging from vendor eBasement,"Comment regarding packaging: This vendor, eBasement, are very much amateurs. They covered the bottle directly with packing tape, apparently to prevent leaking during shipment. This tape is very aggressive and cannot be removed from the bottle without ruining the label. I am sure the stuff inside is fine, but this vendor's cheap shortcuts really irritated me. They could have taken more time and protected just the cap without permanently impacting the bottle and label. Unfortunately, the day I purchased, Andora did not have the item available or available for immediate shipment via Amazon Prime, so I ordered here instead."
3,slide or film cleaner,"I had some old 1950's slides that had mold (?) spots. I read good reviews on this product and ordered it. I tested it first on some unimportant film and it worked fine. Unfortunately on one of my important slides it scratched it. I was also using the ""tiger cloth"" so not sure what could have scratched. I still recommend it but be very careful and test first."
5,A side that needs to be heard,"Michael Schiavo finally gets his chance to respond, and does so (through his ghost, Michael Hirsh) very well. Yes, he indulges in a little character assassination, but after all of the assassination directed at him, he comes off looking restrained.Also, seeing as how most websites out there that discuss the case seem to be devoted to the side of the Schindlers, anything to counter the mistaken idea that they were on the side of right in this one is much welcomed.The book reads smoothly and quickly, with plenty of detail; the major problem is the lack of an index. But this isn't even close to a crippling flaw.Read it and understand that Michael Schiavo was no murderer, and the Schindlers were no angels."
5,It's a shame...,"Having read many of the reviews before mine, I am of the opinion that reviewers who have not bothered to read the book should refrain from giving their ""opinion"". They are totally worthless to those readers who might want to read something worthwhile!I read the book. I found it to be interesting, factual, and backed up by the sort of legal documents all such books should contain. I thought Michael Schiavo was right to protect his wife from the onslaught of cameras and bystanders who knew nothing of his situation. The testimony of the priest was most enlightening. In fact after reading his words, I actually changed my opinion about Catholics in general. A good read all around."
1,Is this really the truth ?,"This man wanted his wife to die so he could move forward in his adulterous affair. Terry deserved to live and be with the family who wanted her, no matter what! Shame on you for putting to death a woman you were bound to the end. Your affair was more important then a life."
1,Book Not Worth the Money,"I still wonder, if Terri wouldn't have wanted to have been kept alive,why did Michael Schiavo try so hard to win the lawsuit to keep her alive. Also, why didn't he just let her parents take care of her after he got tired of having to do it. Would he have had to part with some of the money from the lawsuit? I doubt that her parents had that in mind at the end. All they wanted to do was to keep their daughter from going through a horrible death. He seems like a heartless man. Most people wouldn't put their pet through anything so cruel let alone a wife that he professed to love. Again, he is out to make money by writing this book and that is the bottom line."
3,who profits from the proceeds of this book????,"Perhaps this is a thorough one-sided view of Terri and the battle that ensued,well worth the read.If it were known what percentage of these proceeds are to Michaels pocket, and what percentage serves a constructive benefit,that would conclude the author's intention all along."
1,"Shame on you, Michael Schiavo...and to the new Mrs. Schiavo, may you never get a bad case of the sniffles.","I used to support the notion that we all had a right to choose to die, that we were entitled to be masters of our own mortal destiny. Of course, I assumed that meant that our intentions were made crystal clear, beyond refute.Terri Schiavo's death was cruel, tragic and unnecessary. It illustrates just how slimy a slope euthenasia really is. The ""right to die"" has become the right to litigate the disputed & unwritten intentions of those who cannot speak for themselves.If this is what ""death with dignity"" means, then I prefer to risk an ""undignified"" demise. My heart goes out to Terri's parents & siblings, who only wished to love and care for a woman whose husband had clearly moved on."
3,So many judgemental people,"Unless you have walked a mile in his moccasins, and were there at the time of her ""collapse"", how can anyone judge what decisions were made in the care of Terry Schiavo?Michael Schiavo has every right to tell his story-- and publish it. And each and every person reading this has a right to make the decision to read it, or not to read it.I want to read it. I understand the struggle he went though; I admire the man for putting up with the pressure for so long.It was horrible-- and both sides did seemingly horrible things. Isn't having both sides important, so the truth, usually somewhere in the middle, can be ascertained?"
1,Pathetic and full of excuses,"Michael Schiavo constantly repeats the line, ""I kept my promise"". What about his promise to love and cherish her, in sickness and in health... for as long as they both shall live???? How on earth did the Catholic church condone his extramarital affair with Jodi and even having two children with her? He should have divorced Terri if he wanted to date, marry, have children with someone else. Not perpetuate this pathetic lie that he loved her and was fighting for her.The book is also badly written and very boring, expecially the parts about all the details in the courtroom. I'm glad I only paid $1 for it at my local Dollar Tree."
1,Painful read,"This book was a painful read, considering it is nothing more than a desperate attempt to place blame for Terri's death onto her father - a serious point which is ever so cleverly introduced to the reader early on in the book. If that point is missed, then the reader will be led down the garden path, believing the book to be about Michael and Terri's great story book marriage. But if the reader reflects on that point, the rest of the book is seen for what it is - a man painting himself as a good and noble husband - with him as the hero and Terri as the victim of an insensitive father. The only reason I gave it one star is because there were no zero's."
1,Pathetic only begins to describe this book....,"Don't waste your money - if you must read...go to the public library; but don't give this heartless man a dime. What a sad commentary on Terri's legacy. This wasn't a tribute to Terri, but a last stab at the Schindler family. If Schiavo had any decency at all, he would of just given Terri back to her family (PERIOD!!) AND, for him to write ""I Kept My Promise"" on Terri's headstone...he knows, full well, that that wasn't meant for Terri...it was yet, another stab at the Schindler's. Yes, he ""kept his promise"" to kill Terri (keep her money) and keep her from the Schindler's (you ""won"" Michael...does it feel good??). Schiavo will meet his maker and Terri will be sitting to the right of him."
5,Great weather information source.,I bought this book a couple of weeks ago. This book is full of information which is interesting and fun to read. This is a must have for anyone interested in weather and its difficulty in predicting.
3,It's okay.,"I love Stoltzman because he plays everything over the top! Well, he doesn't really do this on the Mozart clarinet concerto and the result is just so-so... Honestly, it's still probably better than most people could play it, but considering the many amazing interpretations out there, it's not exceptional.I like the Bassoon Concerto, but the clarinet is WAY to loud. It doesn't sound natural (perhaps he was overly miced or something). Also, his cadenzas seem a little uncharacteristic for the classical style (although I'm not really aware of what that means...) I'm just going by my gut based on cadenzas I've heard in the past.Overall this isn't a bad CD, but it's not exceptional. I bought it because I like Stoltzman a lot and pretty much have all his CDs. I would consider this a luxury item (if you have the money and don't mind spending it - go for it... if you're trying to acquire staples of the repertoire, then maybe look elsewhere)."
3,caution for healthy people,I was under the assumption that by purchasing this product I was going to be super healthy...not saying this is a bad product by no means but if you are a healthy person and are not doing marathons etc then do not buy this product. I only took 1 tablet a day and the niacin in this product made my face swell and all I wanted to do was sleep. And yes I was checked over by my physician and she confirmed this. My physician stated that unless I was doing marathons etc or was so lacking in all vitamins then regular fit people should stay away from this product because the dosage is way too high. Again I am not saying this is a bad product but DEFINITELY consult your doc before taking.
5,Great vitamins.,"I have been taking these vitamins since January, at my doctor's suggestion. It took a few weeks for the effects to kick in, but they have made all the difference between feeling OK and feeling great. I have been eating quite well for many years, but these vitamins seem to fill the inevitable gaps. I can't imagine anyone having a problem with these pills, other than the inconvenience of taking so many per day. I can't help wondering if the people who had negative experiences also have other issues that came into play."
3,Notice: This is only a 30 day supply,"240 Tabs is misleading; 1 dose = 8 pills (that's $40 a month)! They conveniently omitted the ""servings per bottle"" data: understandable. I was shocked when the product arrived and I read the bottle; I've been into health foods for decades and was once a personal trainer who also consulted on nutrition and supplementation. At $40 per month you could buy the organic foods and skip the supplements. Never have I seen a multivitamin supplement that had so many pills as one dose or serving. I gave it 3 stars because I do believe the quality of the product itself is above average; however, I thought Amazon buyers should be prepared for the ""sticker shock"": Buyer Beware!"
3,Handle with Care,"I bought these vitamins after a lot of research (this was in top 5 on the list). After eating just one tablet, I get a niacin flush and a headache that persists for 12+ hours and impairs my daily functioning.Before trying this brand, I was taking one pill a day of GNC mega men heart, for the last 7 years, without any ill effects. I do believe that the product is good but it may be too potent, too well absorbed and so can raise toxicity concerns due to overdose. Your mileage may vary since everyone is different. So try them but don't assume that you will be able to tolerate them (even at 1/8th of daily dose).So after trying to eat 1 pill every day for 10 days, I can't take it any more. I will be switching to another highly recommended brand."
1,Price fixing by the manufacturer?,"I love these vitamins. Why did I give just one star? I started buying these vitamins in May. The lowest price offered by third party sellers (of a range of prices) was 38.19 for the 240 tablet bottle, this very ASIN.In July and August, the price had climbed to 49.95. Now, the price is 68.50. Not only is it 68.50, but every seller, ALL 31 OF THEM, has them priced at 68.50. A few weeks ago, all but one seller had them priced at 68.50. That sole listing's different price was not visible until you added the item to your shopping cart. You know, one of those situations where the manufacturer sets a restriction on the lowest advertised price, and you can only see the price by adding it to your cart. What was this lowest price? 67.50. One whole dollar less than 68.50.These vitamins are still in production. They are no rare commodity. Why is there no competition on here? Yeah, I believe the manufacturer is pressuring sellers to raise the price on these."
5,Program worthy of Trek,"The station is in danger. The Cardassians have left Sisko with a little computer virus that might kill them all (it certainly kills some). This episode is widely considered amongst us Trekkie's to be one of the best stand-alone episodes of Star Trek:Deep Space Nine. It is well written, acted, produced, and made. Everything brings you into a great Star Trek story. This is Sci-Fi at its finest. Don't skip this one. 5.0/5 Stars! ~Keep On Trekkin'!"
4,Jem'Hadar Baby,"Good DS9 episodes like this mostly start the same: Quark does something, and then the station is in trouble again. This time, it's with the Dominion, or at least, one of them. My favorite part is about Jake, not the Jem'Jadar. This is classic Star Trek formula, and, in my opinion, essential to the Dominion story arc. 4.3/5 Stars. (I really liked it) Nicely written and thought provoking. ~Keep On Trekkin'!"
3,The Love Bug,"Everyone is going love crazy on the station during a Bajoran celebration festival. Oh, and we get a special appearance by Majel playing a crush on Odo. It doesn't take a genius to figure this episode out. It's fun, but that's about it This episode is a good Valentine for the Trekkies, but has nothing to do with any storyline, character development, or the Trek universe. It's probably my least favorite Lwaxana Troi episode. 3.1/5 Stars! ~Keep On Trekkin'"
3,Be aware of problems with the dvd's,"I love this series and the DVD's are great ....except for one major issue... Series 3, the first episode.. the sound and video are not in sync. The whole first episode is messed up. I also found one small same issue on series 2.It deserves 5 stars if there were no problems. These problems are major and better be fixed. and replaced!!!!"
2,Good subject awful DVD,I loved Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. So it comes as a doubly rude shock to see the abyssmal picture quality of the DVD's. Where do I start? There is the creepy effect at times of faces moving inside the makeup. There are some places where some objects seem to jitter about on the screen while everything else is fine. The overall picture is hazy and the colors strange.
5,DS9 is the Trek of the future!,"Awesome quality albeit at 4x3 aspect.If youve not watched DS9 since it aired, youre in for a treat! The plotline was at least a decade before its time!!!!"
4,This show is really getting amazing (4 1/2 stars),"I tried this show on a whim, and have become truly impressed. This season really started to show some payoff. The begining of the season, with both odo's origins, and the rest, was easily a great start. The show progressed better and better. I enjoy watching the characters become dimensional, and unique, straying from the early dimensional versions. I must say, I truly regret not getting into this show when it was on. Give it a try."
3,Completely unnecessary,Jake and Nog have a dumb friendship argument that is beyond obvious. And lots of made up medical jargon is used to progress the plot (even for Star Trek it's a bit unbelievable in this one). Someone dies and people cry blah blah blah. That about sums it up. I rarely say this when it comes to ST but skip this episode!
3,Worth watching for the last 15 minutes.,"I think some of the ways Avery Brooks shines as Sisko is when he's playing father, husband, and lover. So the interaction between Sisko and Jennifer(Felecia Bell) sparkles, and is definitely worth it. The chance for Sisko to talk with a version of his wife? Good character development. Sometimes I need a break from the Dominion story. This episode is not perfect by any means, but it fills the bill."
1,Almost Star Trek,"This episode has the smell of Star Trek, although once again the leadership was poor like all the rest of the shows before it. Dax should have been the Captain of the Defiant, and the result should have been much different. Poor leadership always loses battles!"
3,"Rest with the Prophets, Vedek Bareil","This episode concludes the character of Vedek Bareil. And to be honest, I'm glad he's gone. Cause Kira needs to keep her head in the game for what's ahead in the Dominion war. This episode has nothing to do with any storyline, except a way to remove the Bareil character, and build some others. On the Trek-O-Meter, I give it 3.0/5 stars. It could have been better, skip this one if you've seen it before. ~Keep On Trekkin'!"
3,The Rules of Acquisition are Changing,"The Ferengi. Do you want to know more? Well then, the Grand Nagus shows up on the station giving away everything like he was Oprah. Quark takes care of business. This is Armin Shimerman's episode, and he does a good job making us chuckle. But it's 90% Ferengi, 10% Starfleet. And it's a stand-alone episode that doesn't have anything to do with anything except Quark. 3.4/5 Stars. ~Keep On Trekkin'"
5,Change and Changelings,"Part 2 of this epic series brings a lot of twists and craziness following Star Trek formula. However the ending is not what you'd expect. But I did enjoy it, and this episode is important to the story arc. I think you'll like it too provided you've watched the last couple episodes. I think it's more important to the background of Odo and his part in the whole venture. 4.5/5 Stars. Note: If you're watching DS9 just for the Dominion war, you can skip ahead to Episode 6, The Abandoned. The rest are all stand-alone episodes having to do with the charachter relationships. ~Keep On Trekkin'"
3,"Happy Birthday Doctor, have a piece of your mind?","It's Bashir's 30th Birthday, and he gets attacked. Maybe he should have been a professional tennis player instead? The rest of the episode has nothing to do with any storyline or character development. It's very predictable; unfortunately I kept my hand on the 2x button half the time. Yes there's a lot of mystery, but not very good. I don't think this episode lives up to the Star Trek name. See this only if you have to see every episode good or bad. I give it 2.6/5 Stars, which is one of the lowest reviews I've given a Star Trek episode (and I'm a huge fan). Pros: Good Make-up, and it must have been fun for the production team to trash the sets. ~Keep On Trekkin'"
4,Gathering Steam,"Season three, while it doesn't have as many excellent episodes as some of the others, has some of the best. ""Explorers"" and ""Improbable Cause/Die is Cast"" are good examples. Primarily, we see the Dominion War arc and some character arcs that would dominate the later series begin to gather steam."
4,DS9 Season 3,"This review covers season three and the streaming experience from AmazonI'm enjoying catching up on this series, you never see it in re-runs. It's nice to see your favorite episodes on YOUR scheduleAs for the streaming experience:I began watching this series on my macbook pro and then on my Kindle Fire HDThe connection to Amazon is much more stable on my Fire."
4,The Story Gets Going,"I think the writers hit their stride by the 3rd season, but it does help to have had some background from the previous two. Deep Space Nine never got the credit it deserved for story quality."
4,Spin Chair,"The chair is hard to spin because it is on a pivot point on the bottom versus allowing the chair to spin freely, My daughter loves it and uses it everyday even if she just wants to eat snacks!"
3,Does not keep a little one interested for long,"I bought this chair thinking my 18 month old son would love to play with it. He will sit in it and bounce once or twice, but since it is not that comfortable to actually sit in, he moves on to something else.[...]"
3,scary,"I bought this chair for my 18 month old twins. When I turned on the chair my kids were scared to death of it and asked me totake it away. I was able to take it back out a couple of days later but I did not turn it on again. I tried a couple of times to turn it back on but every time my kids would run away scared and I would have to put it away again. Also the chair does not seem very confortable, every time my kids sit on it the nose sticks into thier back and they push on it to try to move it back."
4,Worth the $ if your child loves Elmo,"We got this Elmo chair for our god daughter for X-mas, she's 2. She loved it! Any child who loves Elmo would love this chair. It's soft, light and small in height, perfect for the little one to sit on. It really does not do much though. Basically the child sits on it and if the child could understand and following instructions, Elmo tells the child to spin and laughs."
2,Elmo is scary,"First, I am a little dense as I read the reviews and still was suprised that the chair does not ""spin"". The spinning mechanism is the hard plastic bottom that is also a little convex. This is supposed to make it possible for your child to spin it with their own muscle power. However on our carpet, there's no way she can spin this thing even if she wanted to. Which, by the way she doesn't want to because she's scared of the chair. She's 18 months and doesn't get scared very often, but Elmo does the trick. I tried putting a blanket over it and that worked, until she realized she's more comfortable on the floor. Oh well, I didn't need that 60 bucks anyway."
4,Love This Chair!,"My mom got these chairs for my daughters who love Elmo to death. However, we purchased this exact chair at Target for $39 a chair, no where near the $69+ they are being sold for here."
4,Elmo Says Buy Me!,"I purchased this Elmo chair for my 20 month old son and he loves this chair! When I took it out of the box he yelled ""Elmo"" and ran over to hug him. I would recommend this chair for any toddler who loves Elmo as much as my son does. It's definitely worth the money!"
2,Television Advertising Was Misleading,"When i saw Elmo's spin-chair and in small print the words below the screen read ""Batteries Required"" I knew I just had to have this chair for my two year old that stood in awe each time she saw the commercial. Never did it say that the chair does not spin on its on as it twirled and twirled seat empty. So I went to Target where the ad said the chair could be found, only to discover they were sold out so I had to order online. That's when I found out why.Misleading, this chair was much too expensive to just sit there and say a couple Elmo phrases (which is what the batteries were for). Futhermore, our home is fully carpeted so needless to say, there weren't much spinning going on. Big disappointment. But hey, at least my girl have a nice lounging chair worth $20 at best though."
2,Is not Like it Sounds,"This chair does spin but only if the childs spins it thierself. I thought it spun when the child sat in it, all on its own but it doesn't. My son who loves elmo only likes to sit in it. Elmo chair also doesn't talk very loud so it is hard to understand what he is saying. Save your money!!!!!"
3,NOT WORTH SIXTY BUCKS!!,I bought this chair at Babies R Us for 29.99. If your baby loves Elmo and you just want a fun chair for them it's worth the 29.99. No way is it worth over 60!
4,I have this book for sale,I am selling this book in the auction section. Please bid on it if you would like to buy it!
3,A Morning Shade Mystery #2,"CeeCee, Maude, Stella, and company are back. This one has to do with chain letters. The new guy in the neighborhood is trying to win CeeCee in a most juvenile way. This guy can't take a hint! He flings spitballs at people's heads in church and Stella has to stare him down like the juvenile that he is. He's big on gags, causing many gags.Stella claims that she's ""only hanging on by a thread"" and still reading the obits. She wants to be able to help Maude financially.Maude can't pay her bills as no advance checks are forthcoming.While there was one animal less since starting the first book in the series, more have now been added to the zoo mix. None of them seem to be leaving any time soon.You feel as though you get to know the characters personally after awhile. Good character-building."
4,A wonderful first book!,"Kudos, Ms. Rosnau. I enjoyed this book from start to finish. The characterizations - particularly Johnny whom I loved! - the setting, the style, and the development of the romance (lots of sexual tension, lots of depth - again, excellent!) reminded me of my favorite author, Marilyn Pappano.This book read as if it were Ms. Rosnau's tenth - or twentieth - certainly not her first. I can't wait for her next book. I'm thrilled to have discovered her at the beginning of her career."
1,Fragile LCD,I just want to add my voice to the chorus of complaints about this camera. My daughter turned the camera on after owning it for two months and the LCD was broken. Canon refuses to cover this under the warranty. I wouldn't buy another Canon product after this episode.
5,Well made great options,"This little camera has every thing you need, from the high quality pictures to great video ability."
1,Memory Card Error - Card locked,"I just got my SD200 camera 2 days ago. Took pictures, viewed them, and then the battery died. When the battery recharged and I tried to view the pictures again the next day, when I turned the camera on, it said ""Memory card error"" and it occassionally said ""Memory card error Card locked"". I first thought there was something wrong with my memory card, but then I looked it up online and all these Amazon reviews came up that it's their Canon, not the memory card. Fortunately, the pictures I took were still on the memory card when I brought them to a photo store and they were able to burn them onto a cd for me. I'm really not sure what to do now..."
1,My LCD cracked too! And this was a replacement! Total JUNK!,"I bought this camera before a trip to Hawaii. When I got there, as soon as I went to take my first picture I got the dreaded ""E18"" error. If you don't know what this is, just Google ""Canon E18"" and see all the thousands of hits. Basically the camera lens stops communicating with the body, which makes the camera a paperweight. Luckily I was able to return it and get a replacement while I was out there. Fast forward two months, I turn the camera on one day and the LCD is white with a black blob in the corner, with what look like cracks going across the LCD. The plastic isn't cracked or scratched, this is a problem with the how the LCD was manufactured. Now I am screwed. I have a wedding to go to this weekend with no camera.If there is any kind of a class action lawsuit, count me in."
1,Great camera right up until it failed,"The LCD display failed after only 6 months. Up until then it was a great camera, but I am really disgusted with the poor quality that it would fail so soon."
2,LCD Broken,"The camera takes wonderful pictures. I purchased two for my adult sons in December 2005. As of right now, both have broken view screens. This seems to be a major design problem for this camera."
2,"Broken Screen, Broken Heart","Camera is fun to use and takes great pics for its size. But if you're looking for something pocketable and take-anywhere this isn't necessarily it. The screen breaks way too easily. I had it in the front pocket of my jeans and it cracked while I was tying my shoes! Cost to repair is 2/3 the cost of a new camera. I've had a few other cameras, bunch of cellphones, and PDAs, put them through much worse and never had problems with the screen. Canon wants me to pay for the repairs but instead I'm gonna put the money towards something that can survive a few shoe-tyings."
1,LCD Screen is too fragile.,"I have to be honest the Camera is the perfect size, takes OK pictures, but not great, would be great for casual pictures, and home shot. The main drawback is that the LCD screen is WAY too fragile. It literally takes nothing to crack it, and Canon will not cover it under warranty. My LCD broke in a case with a plastic lcd screen protector on it, I have been very careful because I was aware of this problem. Canon built a pocket camera that is too fragile to carry in a pocket. I highly suggest you find and buy something else."
1,It seemed like a great little camera...,"I bought this camera for my twenty year old son for Christmas. The LCD screen broke within two weeks. He sent it to Canon and they said it was caused by impact/pressure, and he would have to pay $150 to have it repaired. When I bought the camera there were no negative reviews on this site; now there are at least seven regarding cracked LCD's. I think this is a defect that Canon should make right. Until then, I would not recommend this camera or any of the same line."
1,Horrible service,"After having this camera for only 5 months, the infamous E18 message showed up on my camera (something having to do with the lens) and the manufacturer refused to fix this problem without me first paying a $108 fee when the camera itself cost me just under $200. That's like paying for half the camera again. I definitely do not recommend buying ANY canon powershot products."
2,E18 renders camera useless,"The camera itself works very well, and I would recommend if it weren't for the notorious E18 error (search Google for it) - which occurred at a particularly unfortunate time for me. Canon charges $250 to fix the problem if it's out of warranty, and denies that there is a design flaw in the camera (which there is - thousands of people are experiencing it)."
4,"Great macro, color. Tough little camera.","I like this camera so much I bought a second one after my first one got stolen. I have other SLR/pro cameras, but take the most shots on this as it's TINY and with me always. It takes great macro shots and has terrific color. The 'night' setting has been fun too. Am surprised to read about others' problems with the LCD -- my cam is always getting thrown around in bags and pockets and never gets a scratch. The only con would be this camera has a few more red-eye issues than others around this size."
3,Good camera - But Breaks Easily,"I have bought this camera for my girlfriend. I am very satisfied with its function and slick design, the picture quality is good, the menu are also easy to operate........There is only one problem: it BREAKS EASILY. I fell it on the ground carelessly (only from 1 foot high) and I got a dent near the arrow button area. All arrow buttons screwed up after that: RIGHT key lost its fuction sometimes, DOWN becomes LEFT, while LEFT becomes DOWN sometimes (totally unpredictable), DELETE key also become irresponsive, although it's far from the dent. I admit I am a dropper, but I have never seen an electronic device screwed up so easily....Now I can only use it in a weird way, no picture review, no deletion, other functions related to LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT are also hard to use or totally lost...."
5,Great bang for the buck,"I wanted a small camera which took good pictures and good video. the size on this camera is great which allows for me to take it anywhere.The picture and color quality are very good, not great, but very good. For the size, I can't complain.The video quality was pretty good at the time I bought it (17 months ago) and the camera has taken a few knocks over the time I have owned it. Be sure to have a large SD card for the videos.For the price and all around qualities, I am really happy with this purchase."
5,Perfect Little Camera,"I honestly don't know much about cameras, but I love this one. This camera has literally been all over the world with me and perfectly captures every moment. I've had it for about 2 1/2 years and it hasn't failed me yet. The pictures are phenomenal and unbelievably clear. The video sound is a little soft though. Unfortunately I've broken the screen twice. The first time Canon fixed it for free. I'm just ready for an upgrade and am awaiting the arival of my SD800."
2,yet aother LCD problem,"Couldn't resist the free Coach bag promotion and got this for my daughter. Took 3 pictures on Christmas and two yesterday as it was carefully carried in its Coach bag.Upon next turning on, the LCD is locked with a frozen batwing that is also visible when it is turned off.First Canon CSR gave instructions on sending it back without mentioning the possibility that LCD is not warranteed. Second CSR said it's a judgement call by the tech as to possible camera abuse and to send a clear note about camera history.It's on its way to repair depot. I saw previous 1-star LCD comments and hoped to be lucky. Sigh."
4,great for travel...,"I have been using this camera for over a year now and have taken it with me on many travels to other countries. I have been very happy with the picture quality and really like this camera. The battery life is excellent and this is an easy camera to travel with (I had no problems with international adaptors, etc). There is some difficulty shooting in bright light settings and the red eye function doesn't work well (although easily correctable with the software). I would definitely recommend this as I great point and shoot camera."
1,Even ONE star is too much for this camera...,"I've had my SD200 for about three months. Yesterday during a site-seeing trip the LCD cracked leaving a white screen with a purple blob. Horrified, I looked online to see if this was a common problem and found HUNDREDS of reports of broken LCDs. I can't believe Canon is not taking responsibility for their poorly constructed product and doesn't order a recall or at least cover the LCD under warranty. The camera works fine otherwise, but is essentially useless without the menu."
4,"great price, great performance for a compact size camera","I have this camera for 6 month now. It has been working great. I now leave my Olympus ""almost full size"" 4 MP Digital camera (forgot the model name) at home and use this little one. The Olympus does have better picture quality (my opinion), but the SD200 is not too far from that. The reason I bought the SD200 is the size and acceptable picture quality. You can find a few detail reviews on the Internet.The movie capture function is great. If you are going to use this feature a lot, I suggest using a 1GB memory card.I did find that I was not able to put date/time stamp on the picture, but realized that this feature is only available when the resolution is set to ""postcard"" (1600x1200). Another inconvenient thing is that I was not able to force the ""flash"" in auto-mode, but switching between auto and manual mode is easy, so I will live with that."
3,It's good for the price,It came with nothing I order a charger and got canon to send me the software so basically i'm happy it works and takes decent pictures.
5,Rock On!,This book rocks! My favorite band in the book is Andromeda from a Buck Rogers TV show in the 1970s. They had a mind control signal in their music that made the kid all over the universe riot.
3,Didn't really use it much,"I enjoyed watching it with my son, but we really didn't use it much. He was not speaking till nearly 2 years old. By then we just focused on English and not any other languages."
2,Mediocre,"[...] Although the author is clearly experienced and knowledgable on the subject of selling-by-owner, the book's rambling style makes it a difficult tool to use. I haven't downloaded the sample legal documents so no advice there."
1,I could have made this better,"Based on the reviews, this item seemed like a decent purchase, but i was quite surprised at the low quality when I received it. It has threads hanging out all over the place and the hat looks way too shallow and doubt that it will even take the shape of a head. I would return it if it wouldnt cost me even more money to do so. Just not worth it."
5,It capped a perfect training!,"We needed these caps to help our ""All Aboard"" theme for a training. They fir great and looked perfect! We are very happy with the purchase!"
2,No support,It is cute but it doesn't stand up by itself like the picture. It's flattened and kinda cheap looking like its been squished and kept up in a closet or space bag for years. Not impressed. Good thing I got it for a 2 year old!
1,The Very Least of Jane Haddam,"I like Jane Haddam's mysteries; in general I find them to belong to the best tradition of detective fiction: difficult puzzles that a clever and wise detective can unravel with the same clues that we learn. This book does not qualify. By the end of the story there was a likely villian and only one likely villian, both in terms of events and in terms of character (which is usually Haddam's strong suit). There were no surprises in the ending. I was dismayed that so good an author could produce this story.If you are a fan of Jane Haddam, you may want to read this for completeness. But please don't expect much from it."
1,Good....for the first week.,I got this product to help improve my speed and calf muscles. I had this product about a week and the end fell off of the rope. I HIGLY don't recommend it.
1,Not worth it,Jump rope cord is coiled up in the package and the cord will stay kinked for the life of the rope. I was hanging mine up and it would kink at the point it was hung from. So for the several weeks that I had the rope it was never straight. I ended the life of the jumprope when it dropped out of my hand onto the floor and the cap that holds the cord to the handle snapped in half. What a piece of junk. I had jump ropes growing up that were better quality than this thing. Look elsewhere.
5,Better than Running,"Used several times already to give workout some cardio as well as help with footwork and developing a rhythm for boxing. The weighted part helps to work out a little bit of my arms, shoulder, etc. Option to adjust lenth of rope is good too: 10 ft might be too long."
5,Great for cardio,I purchased this for my son and he enjoys working out with it. He jumps outside in the heat and comes in dripping sweat. He uses this to compliment his weight lifting and it is great for cardio.
1,Cord snapped,"Cord snapped only after the second time using it. It didn't snag on anything to my knowledge, just from slapping against the concrete. It was a bit chilly out (maybe 35-40 degrees), but that shouldn't be enough to make it brittle. Oh well, you get what you pay for."
1,Handles are horrible,"The handles are garbage. Came in the box broken. Weight broke out the solid end of the handle, the solid end which isnt the side that screws on and is supposed to hold the weight in the handle. Definately not worth the price asked. However, making lemonade out of lemons, I slathered JB Weld on the broken end and works great so far. Still not worth it. I could buy better weighted ropes at walmart for a quarter of the price."
1,Do not buy,"This item is a piece of shit, it is not adjustable easily, in the slightest. The cord will never ever be straight, will always be too tangled to jump. Valeo also will not refund you so do not buy this product."
3,Mis-advertised product and POORLY designed,"1. This jumping rope is TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO LOOOOOOOONG, probably intended for seven-footers.2. There is not way to adjuct the length3. It is advertised as weighted, without disclosing that thge weight is IN THE HANDLES!!!!!!4. For what kinesiological reason is the weighht in the handles?(b) A jumper/skipper wants weight in the rope, so that, it can glide through air, resist air pressure, sweep through grass, since many people are likely to jump-skip outdoorsI had to remove the handles and add weight to the rope, itself."
2,short lifespan,"The rope broke after just a couple months of using it. It sheared in the middle of the rope, and appeared to be from a weakness in manufacturing. Prior to that, I enjoyed using the rope."
2,Poor Quality,"This rope really frustrated me. Initially I loved the weighted handles, but the plastic rope itself is never straight. It always has curves and kinks in it. I accidentally dropped one handle and the plastic completely cracked open. I duct taped it back and continued using it. I then kept having problems with the rope coming lose from inside and had to keep retying it. Then I dropped the other handle (this while trying to get the rope straightened out) and it also broke completely. More duct tape and I was back to skipping. Finally, yesterday, the rope itself broke at the handle. Arggg...Cheap cheap cheap... spend a bit more and get better quality. I still don't know what the best replacement is. All ropes seem to have mixed reviews."
3,"Just when I got used to it, it broke!","I found that the nylon ""rope"" material was very lightweight and hard to get used to. Even my wife had a hard time with it. It spins just fine and fairly easy to adjust--no problems there. I use it in my garage and a few times the handle slipped out of my hand after catching my foot and this last time the handle shattered. I am now looking for a new jumprope and probably won't repurchase this one, even though I have by now gotten used to the higher speeds necessary to keep this rope tight. The weighted handles had a good feel to them and spun well, but it broke when I dropped it. I need something a little more durable."
1,Tangled up in blue,This Jump rope sucks;it gets all tangled up and is not length adjustable as described.
1,IT CURLS UP AFTER 2 JUMPS! NOT WORTH IT,"I purchased this and couldn't even use it the first day I tried it. After a couple of jumps, the jump rope curls up."
4,Good product for arm strength,"The rope was very long when I received it, but then I unscrewed the handles and cut the rope and shuved the remaining of it with the not inside the handlebar, which was fairly easy to do, now it's perfect length and the weight really helps with the strengthening of your arms/shoulders, it's definitely a great workout!"
2,Not very good jump rope,I bought 2 jump ropes. One works great and the other gets twisted and tangled like no other. I could only give it 2 stars because they cost 13 bucks a piece. For 50% effiency I would have rated them 3 stars if they were 7 bucks a piece.
4,good choice,"this is a good choice for a decent jumprope ,the only problem I've had is the ""adjustability' of the rope , you have to unscrew it and then cut it , re-assemble and hope you cut enough and not too little , hard to find the sweet spot without having to cut too much or too littleI had the idea that it would be adjustable but, its my own fault for not measuring I guess.I was thinking some kinda of sliding mechanism to adjust the length, not having to cut would be niceGregg from CA"
2,Not enough screen shots and diagrams.,The book did not have enough diagrams or screens to thoroughly explain the concepts. Several easy concepts (in other books) were just plain confusing. The publisher should take more time to proofread and make the topics more coherent instead of rushing a book out to meet deadlines.
4,A big help - covers the exam well and sample test is good,"Use this book as a ""final review"". It covers all of the exam topics very well. The sample exam and review questions are a big help in preparing for the test."
2,Error full and misleading,I used the vb 6.0 distributed exam cram book previously and thought it was excellent. So when I needed a study guide for the desktop exam this was my first choice. However I was quite dissapointed. The previous reviewers who stated that this book is full of errors are quite correct. I found many errors in questions and comments. What wasn't errors was often misleading. Overall I was quite dissapointed.
4,"Superb last minute exam preparation, if a little inaccurate","Yes, there are some mistakes, but I have yet to see a book that is as focussed on both instilling mcsd exam technique and providing concise technical information. I wouldn't use it exclusively, but combined with MSDN and one of the weightier texts it's a result."
2,It is OK but with a lot of technical errors,This book will give you a nice overview about the topics covered in the exam. I just hope the author could spend more time on technical accuracy checking.
3,Useful but gets off track,"I thought the topics mapped well to the exam but the sample questions and exams sometimes wander. For example, the author spends just a bit too much time on ""trick"" questions. I'd recommend this book for an additional prep-question source but not as a sole study guide. (All hail Transcender!)"
2,Any value undone by errors.,"The author and the editors fail the reader through their sloppy work. And the errors aren't just typos (and some of those are deadly), there are conceptual errors as well. The only value the book can deliver is as an outline for use with the VB documentation and MSDN."
2,Dissapointed By Many Errors,I bought this book as a suppliment to the Microsoft study kit. It really shines in places but there are far too many errors to recommend this book. You can't sudy it with confidence.
1,Shaking my Head,"I'm shocked, really. After reading the Exam Cram for the Distributed Exam, I was amazed at the accuracy of Exam Cram material. But this Desktop book is a waste, and beyond that, it will hurt you in the long run. Too many errors. Errors in the practice exam at the end. Discrepancies between what the practice exam says, and what the author says in corresponding chapters. Beyond that, it's hard to follow. Try the Exam Prep instead..."
4,Great resource for Exam #70-175,"I'm an intermediate-to-advanced level VB programmer, and just passed the VB6 Desktop exam in part thanks to this book. This book is invaluable for helping you focus your studying efforts, and the practice questions are a great resource. I'd like to give this book a 3.5, but opted for a 4, because I passed the exam! There are numerous errors, some inexcusable, and clearly this book should have been better edited. Also, the book is light on the Packaging & Deployment Wizard, VSS and VCM, which make up at least 25 percent of the questions. Use MSDN and Transcender exams as a supplemental resource. Overall, this book provides good summary information, good practice questions, and helps you focus. A worthwhile purchase."
2,Too brief,"The book is too brief. I must say that it is not easy to write a good book for this exam, as the scope fo the exam is wide. I normally classfied a book in these few aspect : Exam prep, Reference, Beginner's guide or Advance. This book is not good at any of the aspect. I do not even use it as reference after I passed the exam.I use Transcender and MSDN, with many hands-on practice. These two helps me the most, not this book."
2,Not necessary to pass the exam,"This book has a lot of good info in it. Alone, it is a good VB reference book. However, it has more info than could possibly be on the exam. Therefore you spend too much time learning what might be on the exam and not enough time on the exact exam material.In the end, I used the Microsoft Mastering Series CD-ROM, Transcender, and MSDN. This was just the right amount of reference material to help me pass. I would spend my money on those, and not on this book to pass 70-176.Also, I used the same materials to pass 70-175."
3,Not enough to pass 70-176 exam.,"This book offers something not covered in the exam and lots of thing are missing which are covered in the exam. I passed both 70-176 and 70-175 by reading several books, but can't remember what this book helped me -- that's bad! I can say 70-175 test cram book is much better than this one."
2,"i passed, but no thanks to this book","Good points: Alot of the necessary info is in the book, in one place or another. The ""Cram Sheet"" is a good last minute review for topics that slipped through the cracks.Bad points: The info is poorly organized. The material is not presented in an easily understandable and comprehensible manner. The package and deployment wizard and its functionality is a big part of this exam, and yet it is not fully explained here (at least not in sufficient detail). The sample test is an interminable exercise in finding the trick to the question, and is not representative of the actual exam. I passed the actual exam by 150 points, yet the day before failed the practice exam here by 250 points.Use Transcender and the Microsoft Mastering Series CD. This guy won't earn your [money]."
1,This book is BAD,"I just passed(barely) the desktop exam and if it wasn't for the Self-Test practice tests I would have failed. There were way too many errors, both syntax and material, that made it extremely difficult for me to have any confidence in the book. About 1/3 of the material covered in the book was not even on the exam. Plus he did not cover some key topics that did happen to show up on the exam. The author of this book should really find another job. He even had the gall to boast about how good a VB programmer he was. What surprises me the most is I actually read a favorable review about this book and the only thing I could say to him is which book was he reading! Don't waste your money on this piece of GARBAGE..."
1,Don't waste your $$$!,"This book will probably make you do worse on the exam.My Biggest purchase considerations:1) Price2) Time Constraint on exam time preparation3) Recommendations from Course Certification InstructorsSome of the content is wrong. (See Page 23: Data Conversion and Promotion for blatant illustration - the sample code provided doesn't even compile!!!) One of my peers recently visited the errata web site and found no mention of any corrections to errata in this book. Granted, it's a pretty new book, but this is still indicative of horrific editing.Your best bet:1) Buy and Study the Mastering VB6 Cd2) Study Online Help (MSDN)"
2,"Quite a few typos, conceptual errors, even in practical exam","I haven't taken the exam but I read the book in great details. There are more typos than I can accept. A lot of material is totally different from MSDN. (I think I can trust MSDN more). There are even errors in the Sample test. Some chapters are not explained well so I could not even tell it is right or wrong.If you have plenty of time and know VB very well, you can sharpen your proof skill by reading this. The editor of this book in Coriolis should be blamed on his poor work. Mr. MacDonald, please proof read your work and try all your code before you put in text."
3,Average supplemental study source,"I would never recommend just 1 or 2 book to use as a study guide. When I was studying for the exams, I used about 6 or 7 books including this one. This book is OK if you use it as a supplemental to all of your other study guides. If you use this book as your single source of study for the 70-176 exam, you will probably fail. Only about 60-70% of material in this book is on the test.There are several errors in the practice questions at the end of the chapters and in the practice test at the end of the book.I would recommend James D. Foxall's ""MCSD in a Nutshell"" (See my review of that book) and the Transcender courses as you primary study guides."
4,A beatiful book that everybody should read!,"""Creativity"" by John Steptoe is an good sory about two little boys that learned that bing different is something special. My favorite part is the end but I don't won't to ruin it. John Steptoe coould have made this story better if he had mad Hector teach Charles spanish.-Tania Lamb 3rd grade at C.L.A.S."
3,This book is great book to have,''Creativity''by John Steptoe is an very good story.There are two boys who are diffrent but one of them speak spainsh.I think John Steptoe could make it better to see how they speak AAL.-Exavie Owens 3rd grade student at C.L.A.S.
4,This book is so great that you have to read it !,''Creativity'' by John Steptoe is a very good story about to boys that speak and learn diffrently and they learn about each others culture. My favorite part is when Hecter told Charles that his sister likes him. I think John Steptoe could have made the story more intersting by telling more about Charles and Hecter's culture. I highly recommed this book .Destiny Nicole Jackson 3rd grade student at C.L.A.S.
3,"Darius' ""Creativity"" Review","Have you read the b ook `'Creativity'' ? Our class read a book called `'Creativity'' by John Steptoe. I like when Charles gave Hector his shoes, because it was a nice thing to do. The author should have made the boys do more things together. I wouldrecommend it to my mom, my dad, and my sister, because they might like it.Darius Harts, 3rd grade Scribe at CLAS"
4,Review by Brittany Lowe,"My class just read a book Creativity by John Steptoe. My favorite part was when they went to P.E. because even though every one was laughing at Hector Charles wasn't. But the author could of told us more about Puerto Rico. I will tell people they should read this book because it is interesting. Brittany Lowe, 3rd grade Scribe at CLAS."
3,Yo-Yo is Definitely a Go-Go!,"Well Mulberry Lane is back, but this time they brought a hyper beat with them. The sound has more groove and bite, but this is not a bad thing, just a different direction. The heart felt lyrics are still there (maybe just a little more fun and witty) and they can still make you melt with their voices. This is a smart and tight song with an internal beat that is quite tasty and sounds even better turned up loud (put mine on 11 please). You can not help but sing along on this one and it even has a good dance groove to it (right Bo?). They have a new sound, a new look and new names and look poised to be the next darlings of the pop chart. And if you like Yo-Yo, wait until you hear the rest of the CD, it is totally connected!"
5,"Yo-Yo is fun, danceable, and has a cool vibe",I heard Yo-Yo on the radio here in Colorado a few days ago and immediately loved that song. The groove is awesome and the words speak directly to us girls deal'in with the playa thang. The girls in this group sound ... fat and purr like kittens. My friends are now onto the Mulberry vibe and we cannot wait to get their new cd when it comes out. This joint is rockin and these girlfriends can sing.
4,book,"if you like ""political intrigue"" mixed with ""vampires"" you'll like this ---(be aware slow to start)"
5,Another gem from Cullen!,"I can't imagine any guitar fan not loving this album...in fact, any lover of the quieter end of the music spectrum should be thrilled. It's a recording of all originals, recorded solo, with references to jazz, folk, classical, new age and pop stylings without falling easily into any one of them. While his writing is beautiful, it's Cullen's playing, exquisite, but always in the service of the music, that carries the day for me. There's a weird sort of joyous bittersweetness to the compositions, that drew me in from the first notes. Enjoy this one!"
2,dictionary,"The book was in fine shape, but it was supposed to include a CD. The CD was not in the package! very annoying!"
3,I was disappointed with this book,I found this book too basic. Most of the book is about choosing the right equipment. There are only a few chapters on flying. I found alot of this information by searching Deja News and reading rec.models.rc.helicopter.
5,Great book for beginners!,"This book is very well setup and organized for the beginner in mind. It does not assume that you know everything, and by the end of the book, you'll know enough to finally fly a helicoptor. However, the tech info is slightly outdated (1995), but it is still very helpful. I'd strongly recommend it. I'd also recommend getting Milt's Helicopter videos too!"
2,Too old to be truly useful,"A lot has changed in RC helicopters in the last few years, and much of the information in this book is dated. I thought it was alright, but I've seen equally good information and training exercises on various web sites for no cost."
3,A bit out dated.,"Does a good job of going over the basics of RC helicopters but is a bit out dated for today's standards. When the book was written, the technology found in modern RC electric helicopters did not exist."

1,Read A Book........... Any Book!!!,"This movie actually put the fish in my aquarium to sleep! It has no plot, point, or reason to be for sale. Trust me save you 5 bucks!"
3,Alot to Evaluate,"The book arrived in a very short time, and in great condition. It is pretty in-depth reading and can be a little confusing. I'm not very far into it but still pushing ahead."
1,WARNING Not Chrisitan Theology but New Age and the Occult,"Warning: this book is not chrisitian but New Age and the Occult. The author spent the last two years of her life in the blackest psychotic depression according to psychologist and priest Fr. Benedict Groeschel who is also an expert in private revelations. Go to the EWTN website and find the article in the document library under the heading of New Age and Cults, keyword A COURSE IN MIRACLES. Fr. Groeschel was an aquaintance of the author and gave an eulogy at her funeral. Fr. Groeschel believes that the author's experience with the channeled ""spirit"" was possibly a true diabolic manifestation."
5,A Course in Miracles,A great book that goes into great depth of explanation about life and the biblical meanings in life.
3,a course in miracles,"I enjoy the objective in this christian approach to our connection with the whole of life and the approach to how to get there, although I struggle with the Total Male language. I know that this disregard for woman is a breach to our society. Otherwise, I read it & translate the language mentally which is very time consuming & lessens the pleasure of obtaining information through reading it."
5,Practical.,"If you choose to buy this book, I would encourage you to start with the manual for students, and read the text as you go.Honestly, I find the text to read like stereo instructions. it's useful, but I can only absorb it in little pieces. When I first got the book, I tried to read the text, because it's the first section. I didn't like it, so I stopped reading it.A few months later I realized that there was a manual back there! I've found the manual to useful beyond words. It's a systematic training tool to remove the ego, and help one find the presence of God in ego's place.If you've been looking for a spiritual guide and have struggled, this is a great way to spend a year or two. The changes you will see will be remarkable!"
5,"When the student is ready, the teacher will appear","I had run out of hope and was desperate for answers when I found this book. Glancing through the contents, I welcomed the intelligence, depth and honesty of the writing, yet felt apprehensive about the commitment such a book would require of me. This self-study program examines how the ego thought process can only create conflict and chaos in our lives. It works at the level of the mind to change the fundamental concepts of the thought process and guides us to a real inner peace based on forgiveness, truth and unconditional love. If you have ever felt deeply alone, unable to find lasting meaning in your life or wonder if there is a real purpose to all this suffering, applying the teachings of ACIM can guide you to a new way of living in this world. If you are serious about finding a way out, this may be the right path for you."
5,"Find Truth, Happiness and Your Brother!!!","I have been reading A Course in Miracles for about 6 years and I have never been so grateful for it's existence!!! It has helped me to deal w/ death and everyday living. If you're tired of being tired, read A Course In Miracles. Take away the tears and the fears and turn them into Laughter and Joy, no kidding :)."
1,Words of wisdom from a seeker,"I only have two words for this book. Confusing and circular. I could not get through the first one-third of the book due to its wordiness and confusing approach. I picked it up more than once thinking it was just me, but I don't think so. In the end it is a great bedside table book for insomnia. If you are seeking answers to the riddle of life or on the path for true meaning keep going."
4,Get to know the ego your living in.,"The Course of Miracles talks about the ego that we have identified with. It is written in an effort to break old limiting belief systems and misconceptions. It is best to find a group with a facilitator who knows the material because the book redefines words which makes it difficult to get what the book is really saying. The author received her information material from Jesus. Many orthodox Christians have a hard time accepting that Jesus would be communicating with anyone on earth. Did they think when Jesus Christ left the physical body that he went to heaven and won't be making contact with humanity until the rapture to take us home? If we can talk to God, we surely can talk to Jesus."
1,I Wish I Could Give It,"one and one-half stars because it is in reality just a little better than one star. This mammoth treatise is just about one of the most confusing and impractical things I have ever read. The one good thing about it is that it urges the reader to be done once and for all with the idea of a vengeful, angry god. It also states (appropriately in my view) that behind most negativity is fear and a call for love. Yet that could have been said in one page. Another problem is that the course never truly explains the concept of evil in any meaningful way. Oh, I know that it says evil is an illusion, having no true reality, but one look at Adolph Hitler, Osama Bin Laden and 9-11, and you are forced to deal with this ""illusion.""The reading of this book is akin to the feeling one gets after eating cotton candy-for a moment it is there and very sweet, and then in an instant it is gone because there is no true substance to it..."
3,Almost a little too deep for me...but I will persist,"After reading how reading a Course in Miracles raises one's vibration (David Hawkins' Power vs. Force), I tried, and tried, and tried again to desperately to get into this massive book. It's not a book that can be read in one sitting; I've come to terms with that. I am able to glean nuggets here and there, and it has been beneficial. If the writing was a little more intelligible, this could easily be a 4 to 5 star book. It's a challenge, but in a good way. Namaste!"
5,happiness in a nutshell,"I've been studying the course for 3 months now and all I can say is you haven't lived until you read this book. Happiness has always been elusive for me and I've been a dedicated church going Christian most of my life. In 3 months my life has been transformed and I now love life and love God for the first time in my 60 year life. Before, I always prayed out of sense of fear of God and felt I had to please him in everything I did but now I realize that I believed God to be somewhat of an egomanical and fearful entity whose will was separate from my will. How wrong I was. Everything I've read and experienced for 3 months has convinced me that I never really lived or loved until now. I encourage everyone to read it if you want to start experiencing happiness because this book is ""happiness in a nutshell."""
1,A COURSE IN MILLIONS,Useless and cowardly quiltpatch of self-help cliches that made someone millions. Awful.
1,A wolf in Sheep's clothing.,"Jesus said He was the Way and the Gate to Heaven. He never said He was a way. A Course Miracles makes the person of Jesus Christ nothing more than a way. A Course in Miracles receives it's only credibility from using the name of Jesus. Unfortunately it ends there. The use of Jesus' name is an obvious attempt to attract Christians, but this book is far from Christian.For anyone seeking good Christian literature, this is not it! A Course in Miracles is much the same as other new age writings. It is warmly presented as a great revelation of truth, but falls short quickly after you pass the dust cover.If you have been hurt, ill, or lost and seek guidance from a Course in Miracles, you'll find yourself in the same place at the end. The Hope you seek can be found in only one place and that is in Jesus Christ, the Living Word."
5,Recommended reading for the restless,"For those who are restless with traditional ideas of God, or for those who have a case of the '90's uneasiness, I recommend three books: A Course In Miracles, Conversations With God, and Eckankar: Ancient Wisdom For Today. These three books, written at different times, by authors whose experiences and lives are drastically different from each other, all fit seamlessly, and support each other, lending credibility and most importantly, providing comfort, reassurance, and point the way to a God of Divine Love"
1,I just cannot finish this book.,"I know that this book has gotten some pretty rave reviews from other authors I have read, mostly self-help books, but I'm sorry, I am lost. I bought this book at least a year ago. I cannot get through it. It sounds like a bunch of gobbledy gook for the most part, and there isn't enough explanation to begin with about how the author(s) came to write this. It's like a Bible, even the paper it is printed on, and somehow, supposedly, the author(s) have been given this divine inspiration to write it. After you get through the first part, the rest is supposedly a course you take, and throughout the book I think the intent is to enlighten you spiritually somehow so you are prepared to leave your ego and self behind and become God or one with God. I'm going to continue to attempt this, but it may take me a very long while because I think I had better start over. Too confusing and much too circular for me."
1,nonsense,"Who cares what I think. But for the curious, Jung might have this to say against the metaphysics presented here:""Today as never before it is important that human beings should not overlook the danger of the evil lurking within them. It is unfortunately only too real, which is why psychology must insist on the reality of evil and must reject any definition that regards it as insignificant or actually non-existent. Psychology is an empirical science and deals with realities. As a psychologist, therefore, I have neither the inclination nor the competence to mix myself up with metaphysics. Only, I have to get polemical when metaphysics encroaches on experience and interprets it in a way that is not justified empirically. (...) I must only insist that in our field of experience white and black, light and dark, good and bad, are equivalent opposites which always predicate one another."" -- Carl Jung, ""Christ, a Symbol of the Self"""
1,Exercise Your Spiritual Integrity; Expose This Book,"The text asks us to not feel anger, fear and to give up critical thinking in order to ""be ideally spiritual"".I actually read this course cover-to-cover several times; I was shocked.The biggest shocker was reading that it claimed to be ""channeled by Jesus"".It has been pointed out that Jesus was no stranger to intense, directed appropriate anger.Case closed.In my opinion the content of A Course In Miracles represents classic spiritual strength-robbing new age cult flim flam.Reader please beware."
5,A life-changing experience,"This book came to me by way of one of Jampolski's publications, ""Love is Letting Go of Fear"". I was at a very low point in my life, and desperately in need of something to believe in. Through the study of this book, and working the lessons in the workbook section, I have discovered something about who I really am. Although the belief system taught by The Course is not for everyone, I can see that simply reading some of the beautiful poetic thoughts which make up the text of The Course could provide peace to any truth seeker reading the book."
2,A Course in Miracles,I love the course and have studied it for years. But this edition does not have the paragraphs and sentences numbered. I recommend that you make another choice. I'm returning mine.
5,Be prepared!,"I have been a student of the Course since 1996. Be prepared to re-think your entire way of looking at the world and other people. This is definitely not an easy task but then what worth having ever is? Your reward will be a sense of profound peace and the gain of the ability to see the world in several shades of gray, rather than black and white. You will be called upon to take a good, hard look at your beliefs and judgements which at times can be very unsettling. For me, when I remember to look through the eyes of love rather than fear, I feel peace and calm."
1,False teaching! Beware!,"This book should be more aptly titled, ""A Course in Deception"" because that is what it is. To base a book on information obtained through spiritual channeling is dangerous. How can the author claim the voice who dictated the book is the voice of Jesus when the information contradicts God's true word. Do your homework and ask God to reveal the real truth found in His Word, the Bible. Don't let the answers you want to hear be mistaken for the truth"
1,Beware,"Jesus is the ""light of the world""--not us. Please be careful of this book. There is no scriptural or scientific basis for what it teaches."
1,Must I read this?,"Okay well before I begin I will apologise to anyone who likes this book or actually believes in it. I find it to be pure drivel and redundant, and making no sense whatsoever. Sorry but that's my verdict."
1,Counterfeit Spirituality,"This book was supposedly dictated by ""Jesus,"" yet it contradicts every cardinal tenet of Christianity. 1. God is not a personal being, but an impersonal force or principle. 2. Sin is not a moral offense against God and others, but a lack of knowledge. 3. Forgiveness is not letting go of the bitterness caused by real wrongdoing, but realizing there is no such thing as sin or guilt. 4. Salvation is not won through the achievements of Jesus Christ to forgive our sin and free us from bondage, but is found by looking within ourselves. And on it goes.The book used Christian vocabulary (God, Christ, sin), but not a Christian dictionary (the Bible). It is a counterfeit of the miracle of redemption offered by the genuine Jesus Christ, as recorded in the Christian Scriptures."
1,Wolf in Sheep's Clothing,"Wolf in Sheep's Clothing I don't know how Christians can read this book and give favourable reviews, without realizing straight away that there is something not right with it. The book is a new age work written with Christian terminology and is quite obviously not compatible with Christian belief. For example, The ""Jesus"" of ""A Course in Miracles"" is not the Son of God, never had a physical body, and therefore never really suffered on the cross. The reporter Tracy Moran has written a very good review of this in the EWTN file library for anyone who is interested."
5,Amazing,"A Course in Miracles provides all the necessary tools to allow you to experience a true understanding of who you are and your purpose. By putting its lessons into practice, you will achieve peace at a level beyond what you may have previously imagined. I highly recommend reading Gary Renard's The Disappearance of the Universe prior to or in conjunction with reading A Course in Miracles as it gives an introduction to the Course that makes it understandable."
5,"Bill Ard, Reader in Sherman, Texas","How do I give enough emphasis to ""change my life""? I have studied the Course daily for almost 20 years, and it is the centerpiece of my journey. When I read other books, they are filtered through 'Course' teachings and understandings. This is three books in one that constitute a pathway, a map, a Way to understand one's Spiritual path and other information that a seeker is required to learn and contemplate. There are parts of this volume that I recite aloud at least once every day, and its teachings have woven themselves into who I have become. I suppose you have gathered by now that I really do recommend this book if you are looking for a way to find your Way."
5,Happiness is Within,"I can not begin to tell you what a difference this book has made in my life! Not only has my whole thinking process changed, but I am able now to see answers to questions where anger or distrust had kept them hidden. ""When the student is ready, the teacher will appear"", and for me this book was the beginning of a new awakening. We have been given all that we need for our happiness, it is up to us to listen and follow the direction of the Holy Spirit, and to accept the gifts that God has given to us. To Know that we are Loved. I reccomend this book to anyone who is searching for the answers to what this life is all about, it will give you a whole new perspective and a chance to further develop your relationship with God and your brothers around you."
1,This is a pre-copyright edition - no section or line numbers,"A Course in Miracles is a great book, but when I ordered this particular edition, I was surprised to find that it was NOT published by The Foundation for Inner Peace and did not have Section or line numbers. It is a copy of the Course that circulated before Helen Schuchman and Ken Wapnick edited it and organized it. If you are interested in it for that reason, then buy it. Otherwise, you're better off getting the official copyrighted version, which you can use at a study group because you'll all have the same page and line numbers."
2,Course in Miracles,"I have tried to read this book three times. If I had learned anything from the first 2 readings it would have been to trust my intuition to not read it a third time. Maybe I just don't get it, but it seems as if its an attempt at hypnosis with the emphasis being on ""we are not hypnotized"". I love to read new age spirital books, but this book, while lengthy and complex, (I give the author points for the sheer volume of it) still leaves me feeling like it's not real bright. The main premise being, ""Love is the opposite of Fear"". Personally I don't agree with that, isn't love the opposite of hate or apathy perhaps? In any event I felt the book was simply not worth the read. Sorry."
5,"Heavy on words, but heavier on reminders about our journey here-","I have to admit that I've always bridled a bit at religious dogma, but ACIM is rife with spiritual truths that anyone can benefit from reading. Find yourself ACIM study group, and you'll definitely find yourself among a group of seekers just like yourself, and that is priceless-"
5,A Must-Have,"This book should be in every home. A clear, well-written look at the Father of our Country mostly in his own words. Should be required classroom reading."
4,History Directly from the Mouth of George Washington Himself,"I'm not a big reader, but purchased this book because of the vast number of sources used in compiling this book. What I found was a book that was entirely too interesting to use simply as a reference and ended up reading it in just a few short weeks. The book serves as a great history lesson on the life of Washington and includes several quotes and writings from Washington himself, as well as Jefferson, Adams and Hamilton just to name a few. The books follows Washington all the way from Birth to Death and highlights not only his greatest achievements, but also his many admitted shortcomings and errors thoughout his life. The book does wonder off of the subject of Washington at times for a whole chapter, but typically only to drive home a point in the chapters to follow. I highly recommend this book as well as the others in the American Classic Series. They truely offer a glimpse into the true founders of this country."
1,High-school level reading and often off subject,"This book is easy to read and very well organized into small 1-5 page sections for each part of the story, but it is written at more of a high school level than a serious historical biography. The most disappointing aspect, though is that the book often drifts away from its subject for a few pages or even whole chapters! It ends up being more of a revolutionary era history book with emphasis on G. W. than an actual biography of Washington. I would recommend this book for a first read about the era but it is a poor choice for the serious scholar or history buff."
5,A must read,Great information and words of Washington himself. (foot notes). As interesting a read as any novel.
5,AWESOME BOOK!,"What a book! The Real George Washington in his own words. Dont believe the hype, read his own words then judge for yourself. The father of our country!"
5,This Book Will Make You Feel As If You Know G. Washington Personally,should be on everyone's bookshelves. Makes me love my country and this great man. I feel so grateful for all his sacrifices.
2,Buyer beware,"The National Center for Constitutional Studies is a strong ""moral majority""-ish non-profit organization. Vocal stumping by Fox News host Glenn Beck should generate interest in this book from his followers, but readers should be aware there is a conservative bias to the presentation of information in this work. For a good brief biography on Washington, seeGeorge Washington (The American Presidents). For a good longer biography, seeHis Excellency: George Washington, this author also wrote the Pulitzer Prize winningFounding Brothers: The Revolutionary Generation"
5,fascinating,"This book is like walking with Washington, week by week, through a most interesting time in our history. It should be required reading for all High School students."
5,The very best book about George Washington,I loved this book and found it very hard to put down. It was easy reading and based on Washington's own correspondence. I was fortunate to read it during the time that Obama's health care bill was being past so I really could understand how far away from the Constitution that this administration is. I plan to purchase this book for each of my grandsons for our family 4th of July celebration. This book is a keeper.
2,So Sad,"I am so sad for all the information it did not include. I think news paper coverage of the women's was worth reading and unfortunatly the DC does not do a service to the season the teams had getting there. It is mostly reaction the events. I was at many of the women's games and the claim ""this DVD will follow the Badgers every step of the way to the NCAA Championship"" is unfounded."
2,Landing a large passenger type jet on a aircraft carrier? Really?,"Written by a pilot with thousands of hours flight time. Surely Mr. Nance can write something more believable. The part about having a bomb that could knock out all computers was different, and interesting, but it would be more interesting to see the fallout if it actually worked over a large city."
5,Even better than Pandora's Clock!!!!,"This book was even better than his last. The suspense was undaunting. Again, they had to make this into a lame TV movie. This could have been a great movie. Mr. Nance needs to hold out for the major studios, he's got the idea's that sell."
2,"A Fun Read, Until...","This book begins as a great read. After bringing my mind past the improbable set of circumstances that brings our heros to the position that are in (it IS fiction, after all!), I found the story quite suspenseful. It was really a fun read, until...the author takes us past improbable to virtually impossible! I would have enjoyed the book much more if the author would not have hung one of our heros out on the wing of an airplane (way too ""yeah, right"" for me!), then landed the plane in the fashion described (way beyond ""yeah, right""!). Skip this one; it is not Nance's best. There's too much else to read out there."
3,Improbable but exciting,"Nance has done better work, both with characters and plot. This book stretched credibility and the characters seemed generic to this type of story. Still, it's a page turner. His BLACKOUT is much much better."
5,ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ!!!!!!,"THIS BOOK HAD ME SITTING ON THE EDGE OF MY SEATFROM PAGE 1 TO PAGE 388. THIS FAR SURPASSES PANDORA'SCLOCK. KEEP THESE TYPE OF BOOKS COMING, MR. NANCE.WORTH EVERY PENNY OF ITS COST!!!!!"
1,Did not work,My cat must be the exception to the rule. I have a 6 month old kitten that will urinate in the litter box but for some reason will not defacate there. I tried this litter which is expensive and she smelled and rolled in it and pooped once then went back to pooping outside of it. The other cats just want to play in it they did not use it either. They used the other box we have full of corn based litter.
5,OEM Special,"Although there was an issue with the shipping department, the GM stepped up and made it right. The power supply worked as described and as expected.If you are looking for an inexpensive source of repair materials, this is the go to company,"
5,Did just what I needed,This was a replacement power supply for a computer I needed to continue using. It worked just as it should. Arrived quickly. Done. Thanks
5,Stauffer Knows His Stuff!,"Get this book and replace paranoia with common sense!--Todd Stauffer explains which troubleshooting, upgrades, and repairs the average user can make on the Macintosh (most of them--they're easy), and which are best left to professionals (a few). There are also handy tables showing which Macs take what equipment (drives, peripherals, etc.), so you'll know what to get when you shop for that external hard drive or RAM chip. Go ahead, get this book, and save a bundle on computer work."
1,REVIEWS ARE ANCIENT HISTORY,These reviews are useless. They are over 5 years old and no telling how old the book itself is. Beware of the book and the reviews both.Glad to help.
1,tracking problem /3rd episode each DVD/ rateing DVD not show,"I loved the show, but the DVDs were defective. The third episode on each DVD would freeze and not run from the play menue. At first I thought it was my GE DVD player so I tested the DVD on my computer and my daughters DVD player the proformance was the same in each case.I had them replaced by the good people at Amazon. This is the first time I have had this problem with any DVD. I was disapointed, but Amazon is replacing the set. I am hopeful that there will be no further problems with the DVD formate. 10/29/03 Well, the new set arrived and the first disk has the same problem. I think that the quality control is in need of up grading. 1/18/04 received this box set as a gift for my birthday same problem disk 2 would not play ep 3>"
1,Wrong Item Pkg wrong,Just opened this up to watch it. Outside shell said season 5. Inside? The entire Season 4. Not happy... Trying to return it and looks like I have to pay for everything. Not happy.
4,Ecclesiastes 9:11,"I've been looking forward to this episode since I saw the title, and I do not feel disappointed. I recognized it as a verse from Ecclesiastes:I returned and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favor to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.I think this was a pretty good meeting of the nuance of the verse's meaning and the episode. Time and chance, indeed, happen to us all.I'd love to know what you think of this idea, too.Happy watching!"
5,This Could Be The Best Deep Space Nine Episode,"""Just Remember, Bashir is spelled with an I."" THIS IS IT FOLKS! After 5 whole seasons, and getting network extension contracts, they give us the Battle we've all been waiting for. Another one of my favorite quotes from Sisko, ""Mr. Worf, activate the defense array."" A Perfect 5/5 for this! On to Season 6: the war.This is why I love Star Trek. You must watch this episode. RESISTANCE IS FUTILE. ~Keep On Trekkin'!"
5,Red Shirts Beware! (or is it Gold now?),"So why did the Cardassians abandon DS9's sister station: Empok Nor? You'll have to watch this episode to find out. Although it's a stand-alone episode, it is one of the best from Season 5. Con: Not that original for Star Trek. Pro: It does put good plot twists on a familiar Science Fiction tale. 4.6/5 Stars. I thought it was well done! ~Keep On Trekkin'"
4,Odo's Like a Virgin,"It's a Mystery, and not a bad one. However, I remember it, so I like it. And there's some great humor in this episode. Unfortunately, it's a purely stand-alone episode about Odo's feelings. And I didn't see a secondary plot point to go on besides that. Boo to the writes, but still a nicely done piece of science fiction. I'll give it a healthy 3.8/5 stars for that. ~Keep On Trekkin'"
5,Star Trek: Deep Space NIne season 5 review,"This is a great addition to the Star Trek Series.You will love all the twists & turns in Season 5. For all real trek fans there is an very special episode featuring the original U.S.S. Enterprise. You will not believe your eyes. Also, Gul Dukat & his Cardassian punks pay another visit to Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. fans will be introduced to a new species called the Vorta & other exotic alien species."
2,I expected to like this one...but didn't,"I am a big fan of Quark and Rom (heck even the Negas) but this episode was so slow...and disappointing. I find most of DS9s romances unbelieveable and contrieved, as a matter of fact the only relationship that actually makes sense and is well written is the Dax-Worf couple. Rom and Lita, Miles and Keiko, Kira and *whoever*....they all feel so fake and annoying. And Rom and Lita relationship takes up half the episode...ZzzZZZzzzz"
2,skip it,Unless you like crying or watching people cry skip this one to the max. Doesn't serve much purpose and the writing is a a bit wonky compared to what I've come to expect from this series. Here's to hoping this season picks up in the next episode (past two have been disappointing)
5,This episode has it all,"Time travel, Temporal police, magical orbs, Star Trek season crossover, Captain Kirk, and discussion about how Worf smells. This episode was supremely enjoyable and a welcome surprise considering the episodes surrounding it."
4,Highly recommended if...,"you can get past Jake's forced acting. It seems to be a recurring theme in Star Trek that they cast some really bad child actors (I think Nog might be the exception). The last couple of minutes is worth watching the whole episode, all around good writing."
4,A Prophecy by the Emissary,"The Emissary is being spoken to. I mean he's trippin'! This segment of Deep Space Nine interweaves many key hidden messages to upcoming series events. By this time, I'm sure that the writers and producers had figured out an outline for the rest of the series. Enjoy! Cons: was kinda slow and didn't have much action. But I still liked it, and will watch again. 4.0/5 Stars. ~Keep On Trekkin'"
5,Excelent!,"This is perhaps the best season of a series that, without any doubt, is the best Star Trek show since Capt. Kirk's adventures. I recomend this to any Star Trek fan or anyone that likes science fiction. Special efects are fine, but the best thing about DS9 is the way the writter manages the history from the very beginning until open-war with the Dominion. The way the caracters and the relationships among them evolves over time is brilliant!.My only regret is that all Star trek movies were based on TNG. It would be nice to watch the Dominion Wars in large screen.Last words: anyone interested in DS9 should start in season 1. It is one big story from almost first season until 7th."
5,Awesome Nostalgia Trip,This episode of DS9 was an absolute joy and pleasure to watch! The episode is about an accidental trip back in time for Sisko and his crew to prevent Captain Kirk from getting killed by a bomb disguised as a tribble. It was amazing to see how seamlessly the DS9 crew were woven into the old footage of classic Star Trek.
2,Worst episode evah!,"Well.. for deep space nine anyway. At least it isn't as bad as that last Star Trek series where that touchy feel-y guy was captain.There wasn't even a sub-plot to provide some meager amount of exercise to one's brain. Just the very slow moving and boring main plot. I think the writer just had some weird Odo fetish and really wanted to see him naked again. The love interest was a horrible actress, but largely I think it was the writing and perhaps directing that was to blame. Mainly writing I think.. and poor casting for the female."
4,DS9 is hit and miss....this one's a winner,"I love time travel, I love the idea alternate dimensions and possible futures, and I love thinking about whether we all do have a fate or destiny. This episode had all of that, quite a solid sci fi plot here. But I have to say the ending almost makes it fall apart for me. It involves important information that Odo was given, but he does nothing with it. This goes against everything Odo's character stands for....I won't spoil the ending, but watch it and decide for yourself. I think it's a pretty big plot hole the writers missed."
5,Best Star Trek Ever,This is my favorate Star Trek series. It arrived in good condition and faster than expected. So far no less than 5 of my friends want to borrow it. If you can get it do so.
5,"For All You Sci-Fi Lovers Out There, Snuggle Up!","A Valentine's Episode, and a decent Ferengi episode as well. I have fond memories of watching it on TV. One any true fan would want to see. Major Pro: ""Cupid O'Brian."" Cons: It's a pure stand-alone episode that has nothing to do with any story arcs, and there's no action. But Director Rene AuberJonois did do a great job. The Actors are so full of energy in this. 4.6/5 Stars. Spend the gold and press play. ~Keep On Trekkin'"
3,How do you define innocence?,"Kira's old friends are being killed, and she's at the center of it. And she's dealing with pregnancy. It's OK Star Trek. But a pretty well written ""Who Done It"" story. If you've seen this one before, skip it as it doesn't have anything to do with any storyline. 3.2/5 Stars. ~Keep On Trekkin'"
4,Worf and Jadzia,"A Shakespearean Star Trek tale, or a parody of one. This is a Valentine episode, so get your snug buddy and cozy up. It's a comedy that kept me laughing. No space battles or Dominion activity. I like the performance by Armin Shimerman again, and of course Terry Farrell (rawr!). 4.2 Stars. ~Keep On Trekkin'!"
1,Save yourself an hour,"Odo gets laid, she can't stay with him, he has feelings about it. I just saved you an hour and you missed nothing for the rest of the series."
3,broken order,"The package of DVD's arrived broken and the DVD's wouldn't play on my blue-ray player, I had to grab the old standard def machine and hook it up and then finally the episodes would play although not entirely well."
4,The calm before the storm...,"This season has moments of brilliance. It is also slow in a few episodes. The Klingon storyline gets a little thin. The Tribble episode is worth the price of entire season. It is done with such skill that the time travel sequence seems real for a moment. It is a loving tribute that I will remember for awhile!I am really liking the characters now. The early seasons did an effective job setting them up. It seems this crew is destined to be my favorite. The aliens are once more likeable and believable. The Dominion War looms on the horizon. By the season finale, The station begins to seem vulnerable. Indeed, the Federation itself is being taken where it has never been before-under seige!I am sure there will be a happy ending. War is never good, but it makes an excellent storyline within the Star Trek universe. This is the first time this has happened on such a scale. I eagerly anticipate next season!"
3,Latinum Can Be Hazardous To Your Health,"It's Sid's first time in the director's chair, and he doesn't disappoint! This proves that Star Trek is a good launching point for actor-directors. Although there wasn't much action except Quarks' life, it was still entertaining. I liked all the interesting camera angles we get in this episode. Too bad it has nothing to do with any DS9 storyline. 3.6/5 Stars. ~Keep On Trekkin'"
3,The setup of the last episode,"This episode is kinda important to the DS9 story arc, but it's one of the weaker episodes. Pros: Pah'Wraiths, and Rom. But I found it slow moving. 3.3/5 Stars. I'd say skip this one if you've seen it before. ~Keep On Trekkin'"
3,New relationships,This episode where Quark reunites with his klingon ex wife and The Chief and Kira have their issues was a great part of this episodes plot but The whole thing with Worf and Dax that continues throughout the rest of the series was never one of my favorite parts. Dax loses so much of her charm being locked to worf. The show would have been much better without that parts addition.
4,"Good Season, Great Series","I couldn't say this is the best season of DS9, since the really good episodes are spread out well unlike other ST series, but season 5 definately has a decent selection. DS9 is my personal favorite ST series, with TNG a close second, and I chose season 5 out of circumstance primarly, but it does not disappoint. Enjoy the show"
2,John Agar is the only good actor in this snorefeast,"At this price, i cant complain. This movie is set at night as youhear the crickets...but filmed during the day with the camera iris down a bit to make it look like night. Lots of running and more running. At least the script written for the tennagers is pretty funny as they use words no heard since the late 60's. The creature is not too bad and looks a bit better than Robot Monster. Overhall the dvd is fun to watch up to a point because it has John Agar who appeared in so many interesting, bigger budget science fiction movies."
1,KILLER APE FROM OUTER SPACE,"NASA mutates an ape and it crash lands in Satan's Hollow, a hang out for college teens who drive muscle machines and drink soda-pop. I enjoyed the retro aspect of the film, especially the diner with its cheap wood paneling, red and white Coca-Cola product placement, and orange Naugahyde booths. Note the pinky ring on Chris (Ralph baker jr.). He never worked in Hollywood again.The mutated ape, which looked like someone got the wrong head for a Halloween costume, is also bullet proof. He is an acting and dance critic and kills bad ""B"" movie actors. Typical rift between Feds and local authorities. The film was fairly bad all around.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Clark Gable swear word."
2,Mini Maple,"Surprise! It is only 4 inches high. I was disappointed, thought it would have been much bigger."
1,A Book By The Butcher of Belgrade's Wife,"The author of this book is in reality the wife of Serbian dictator Slobodan Milosevic. She is not just a wife but a prime developer of the ethnic cleansing policy that has slaughtered tens of thousands in the former Yugoslavia and made hundreds of thousands refugees. Knowing that you will be sickened to read the tripe in this book. For example she waxes nostolgic about family vacations in Dubrovnic but neglects to mention that under her husband's orders, and her policy urgings, that beautiful city was destroyed and thousands murdered, maimed and left homeless. How a piece of trash like this got translated (how it got originally published is no secret)is a mystery. Sad to say it is heinous garbage such as this that gives censorship a good name. I would rate it ""0"" star but unfortunately Amazon does not provide that option."
1,"Things that Make You Go ""Hmm...!""","Mira Markovic is the wife of Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian ex-strongman responsible for the atrocities in Bosnia and Kosovo. She was the driving force behind his most ruthless and effective actions, and has her own political party. As a dedicated Communist with powerful family connections, she had no problem obtaining a doctorate in sociology at the state university in Nis. She has published several bad books. Two are available at Amazon.com: ""Night and Day"" and ""Answer"". They have not been popular in the US. However, you may notice two positively gushing 5-star Customer Reviews. Her other Amazon book has two similar 5-star reviews. Apparently written by four different Americans, all four reviews were posted on the same day, November 16, 1999. Makes me go ""Hmm...!"" ;-)"

3,Remake me baby !,"Of all the movies out there that never needed to be remade, here is one crying out for a big budget remake.Funky leads, interesting twists (that could be seriously upgraded and CG'd), a sexy snake dance, motorcycles and US surplus trucks. Terrifying the locals. Fires and druid priests.Mix well with Night of the Minotaur, and remake !Got this on VHS to check it out, and the print is pretty bad, but don't think it is worth buying the DVD unless you are a writer. This looks like another movie made by the stunt guys !"
1,Stink-Wolves on Wheels,"Why isn't there a rating lower than 1, like ""never mind"", for stinkpots like this flick? To the person above my post. STOP your lying, you weren't no extra in this movie. You probably weren't even a gleam in 2 drunken rednecks eyes when this crapolla was made. ""I"" was an extra in this movie. I was the Satanic Priest who cursed the two bikers and sent them on their way. NO, I'm only kidding, I wasn't no extra. But neither was this clown above me. I only seen this movie once, and that was enough for me. I love xploitation, road movies, and horrors flicks and all, but this movie didn't do any justice to any of those gens. Buy it if you want, but you'll more than likely regret it later."
3,"Good game, bad overall design.","This game is sort of a cross between Dungeons and Dragons and Magic: The Gathering, for PSP.Overall, it's a strong game. It has a good battle system, and does quite well as a single-player game.So why did I give it a 3 star overall rating? The overall design of the game is very poor, and there is no plot. I mean this literally: the entire single-player game consists of playing against different opponents. You have to see it to believe it; I have never played a game that didn't even try to put in brief story arcs or cutscenes. Your single-player campaign is nothing more than a list of your wins/losses. You play against opponents (who are nothing more than a picture, no dialogue, no anything) until you win. That is it.I enjoy the gameplay a lot, so I said it's 5 stars for fun. But it gets boring quite quickly if you're not enthralled with a card/grid combat gameplay that you play over. And over. And over again."
4,Great Game! Encouraged for card game addicts,"Warhammer WarCry: Battle for AtlumaThis is a great game. I have a blast buying the cards (in game so it doesn't burn a hole in your pocket) and beating up opponents. The game is strictly a virtual TCG (trading card game) so if your not into that kind of stuff, I doubt you will be able to play for long periods of time. But overall a great game! [...]. (It is based of the card game that is based of the actual warhammer game btw)"
2,"Adequate text, nice pictures","Of all the hundreds of beautiful villages in England, what makes these the MOST beautiful? The author doesn't even attempt an answer, or to provide any selection criteria. Nice pictures, though. At this price, wait for discounted copies."
5,review,Arrived promkptly as promised. Excellent condition. Excellent packaging. A thoroughly satisfactory transaction. Five stars to the vendor and my thanks@
4,Appalachain Trail murder,"This is a good book. It exposes some of the extreme prejudice against lesbians. To stalk and murder a woman because she is gay is beyond fanatic hatred. If you're a lesbian this book will outrage you. Once you realize how vulnerable you can be it will make you really mad, and more careful."
1,Challenge?,"These are all easy puzzles - worked the first several then decided it must be like most other Sudoku books following the easy - medium - hard format. So I went to the last puzzle to work backwards, same thing EASY puzzles.If you want difficult puzzles forget this one."
2,Seriously? You think this is tough?,"When I get a sudoku book I like to try the first few puzzles and then jump to the back and see how hard the last puzzle is. In this collection, the last (regular) puzzle is every bit as hard as the first three puzzles; which is to say, not at all. There are sudoku book out there with some tough puzzles, this is not one of them. It might make a good book for the bathroom to while away minutes and as a passing diversion, but for ""toughest pouzzles"" it is sorely disappointing. I suspect it will ultimately disappoint most folks looking for a true challenge."
1,Ultimate schmultimate - too darn easy!,Worked several of the puzzles at the start of this book in about an hour - all quite easy. Skipped to the very last regular puzzle in the book and solved it in about 30 minutes. Tossed book in garbage.
2,Are you kidding....,"My kids love this slide...the problem is we got it Aug of last year...used it less than 15 times and put it away for the winter...Pulled it out this year and the seam is ripped. Called Amazon they said there is not warrenty but to call manufacture...called the number they gave me and it is not their number, Amazon said they do not have a number to call them....so I am out $400.00 for one month use....Thanks Amazon....Please feel free to call me if you want...I would love to resolve this!"
2,not worth your $$$,"we bought this frm super target.paid almost $500 n less than 30days,the seam where the slide is are showing a big tear.we returned back to the store n they were wonderful as to refund our money back.we had a fun with this slide but the produst are not so well done.other than that,my kids enjoy this."
2,Buy With Caution,"I would purchase this product with caution. I bought this item for my children. I layed a tarp below the slide as well as followed all rules for use. The children enjoyed playing on the slide. They played for more than three hours. When it was time to put it away I noticed that the platform below the scale wall was not holding its inflation. Also, the tubing around the pool filled up with water. I had a hard time lifting the slide to drain the water through the motor/airflow valves. For the price payed I would expect it to be more durable. I have read both positive and negative reviews for this product. My children really loved it however it was a lot of work to take down. Thankfully the store that I purchased it from took it back without difficulty. They shared that many are returned with some of the same concerns: deflation, water in the tubing, and tearing at the seams. Good Luck."
1,DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY,"I have been waiting ONE year for this company to solve my problem with a slide I bought last summer. I have a raincheck, and they are refusing to honor it with a slide I requested that costs LESS then what I paid for the first one. The Jungle Blast we bought last year ripped within 4 days. I followed all the instructions given to me on the phone and everyone played nice until I asked for my slide. Marti Muchler, the ""representative"" I am dealing with now refuses to honor our raincheck. She responds with ""ok"" as an answer to a multi-question e-mail. She finds humor in the fact that I am out nearly $800! What an idiot. DO NOT buy anything from this company. You will DEEPLY regret it."
1,Do not buy this slide!,"We bought this slide last summer and the kids loved it. It was easy to use and filled up quickly. But after using it less than 10 times, the inner lined pulled away and the slide couldn't fully inflate. This was not a tear on the outside - we had those too but it was easy to fix with a patch, you could see through the slide to wear the tube pulled away but couldn't get to it without cutting through the top layer. Afeter mulitple emails and calls with the manufactuer, the said they would not replace or refund the slide because it was past the three month warrenty. So I paid $500 for a slide we used a couple of times!!!"
2,Not so great,"This is our second summer with the slide. It is very hard for one person to set up or clean or put away. You can't fill it as deep as you see in the pictures advertised, but the kids love it anyway. Dogs like it, too. However, be warned that if you don't clean it well or check for tears or leaks, you'll have a huge headache trying to fix it or contact customer service. The number provided no longer works, and we can't find the manufacturer online. I don't think this slide was made to last that long, which is sad since entertaining kids is a hard enough issue.I've had to spend extra money buying patch kits and what not. This will also destroy whatever grass you have, so if you like grass don't buy this. It's also a huge waste of money in regards to the water bill. The pool doesn't really hold that much water. Fill it to where you think it should be a comfortable level and the sides will give way."
3,Poor quality and durability,Only used it 2 times (my kids ages are 3- 10) The thread where its stitched together is coming apart.
5,good buy,"The pool could be deeper but anyway kids have lots, lots, lots of fun.I'm glad I got it but require a lot of work drying it..."
2,Banzai Sidewinder Falls,We got the slide in june of 09. I have two kids 3 and 6 that played on it eveyday last summer and had a blast. Thought I had purchased a good product until we went to use it this year. the thing practically came apart and would not hold air.I fixed a couple of holes but it would not inflate the top. Come to find out there is a liner on the inside that came apart which cannot be repaired. The kids and I are extremely disappointed. Dont think I will by any more of their products.
2,Not durable!,"Despite the poor reviews, I went ahead and purchased this slide. Day One: lots of fun; our two boys ages 3 and 5 had a blast. Day 2: Just as much fun and they played on it all day. When we were deflating the slide we noticed a tear where the pool meets the inflatable panels. We were able to repair it (hopefully) but should this be happening on Day 2???? If you've got the money to blow, go for it. Not sure if there are any durable waterslides out there!"
2,fun but not for long,"We purchased this last year and the kids 6,6,11 had a great time playing on it. We got it out this year and played on it 4 times and it split under the lining right along the turn of the slide. We tried everything to fix it with no luck. So I would say it is great fun but don't count on it lasting forever."
2,JUNK!,We played onit for a week after 4 days it started to loose lots of air then it poped! dont wast your money.
1,Great until the seams fall out/Big Safety concern,Got this product three months ago and had fun until the seams came out of it. The manufacture will not fix the problem and recommended a seamtress in the area to get it fixed. Wow this must mean they get this issue a lot. The seams came out below the ladder and created a big hole and let the air out. Thank god my three and two year old were not at the top when this happened. Do not buy this product the seams will come out and someone will probably get hurt sooner or later.
2,Don't buyt it!,"After using the Sidewinder Falls slide, for the first time, it ripped along the seam of the mesh net on top. Toys R Us will not take it back or refund me. I am in the process of trying to get a refund from Banzai, but it has not been easy thus far. It's a shame, because the kids had a blast on it, it's just not durable at all!! Buyer beware"
1,Chalk it up as a lose!!!!,"Of course i read all the reviews, AFTER ours ripped. Bought ours last summer, only used it a couple times. Got it back out today (June), kids got to play on it about 2 hours when the slide side wall blew out. I think we're SOL as they say. Obvious the manifacturer wont do anything about it, according to all the comments......I guess we write this $[...] investment off......I think someone should start a ""class action"" law suit!!!!!!!"
2,Does not hold up for the price,"We bought the 2007 model and within a week it had a hole in the seam so the company where we bought it replaced it. We used it about twice a month for our grandchildren- so it got little time in the sun and was not ever put away wet. We used it two summers. At the end of the second summer it began to leak air from all the seams. This unit was never abused - only two kids at a time and they were under 6 years of age. Now, at the beginning of the 3rd summer - it is unusable!!! I notice this current model says ""2009 Model"" - not sure what that means but - hopefully it has better UV protection. We paid almost $600 for this slide and it should last longer than a few months for two summers. The ad mentions ""years of family fun"" - that's NOT true. Something that costs this much money should last longer than a few months. I'm planning to buy another model from the 2009 collection. If I have the same problem - it will be my last Banzai product - EVER!"
3,Slide review,Overall the slide is a good value. The air blower which inflates the slide is the only problem I have encountered. I have needed to replace the air blower twice.
2,"Fun, but not durable","This slide is great fun for the kids. They were very excited about it and loved the curved slide and pool at the bottom. This is nice because I have children of different ages that can enjoy different features of the slide. The little ones can play in the pool and the big ones can slide. But....The second time we got it out, we noticed a 4 inch place where the seams had come apart; the thread had just ripped or broken and there was a hole leaking air. As a result, the slide didn't inflate to the maximum amount and the water leaks out of the pool. This is not the type of problem that can be patched; it is a defect on the slide. We are contacting customer service; we'll see how far we get."
1,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS MANUFACTURER!,"I purchased this slide last August. My kids played on it for 1 month. They loved it. We followed the directions for storing. We got it out this year, the kids played on it only a few times before we discovered the stitiching was coming apart along the side of the slide. After we sealed up the stitching (as we would on a river raft) we noticed the lining along the slide had come apart and the air was leaking out the whole length of the slide. Of course, since we are past the 60 day warranty, the company won't do anything about it except tell us we'll need a pool company to repair it. I read reviews before purchasing, and figured we had about a 50/50 chance of it working out for us. Unfortunately we were in the wrong 50. It's a lot of money for 60 days of play. And the company knows it won't last longer than that. Spend the extra money and buy from a company that stands behind it's product."
1,how to fix the leaks after a few months,"Buy a thick tarp from costco. The cheap ones break down too quickly. Buy 3m spray adhesive. Turn on the air pump and with a wet hand feel around the areas that get the most traffic like ladders, exit areas or water cannons. Mark the leaks with a marker and deflate. Get the areas very flat and cut the tarp to at least a foot bigger than the areas that leak. Spray the tarp area fully with the adhesive and wait a few minutes until its very sticky and stick on the tarp patch. Wait a day. If its really bad buy a second pump on ebay or craigslist and hook it up to the air outlet."
4,good buy,price is OK.build quality is dubious on the plastic parts.i would give 5 starts if one of the ends where angled.
4,Bumble Bee Lemon Pepper Tuna,"I eat a different variety of the tuna kits everyday at work. This is my least favorite, but it still tastes good and is a quick snack in between meals."
5,Great snack and cheap too,"Tastes great for a cheap snack. Not top quality tuna, but it is good enough and better for you than most snacks. I put a little squirt of squeeze bottle herb mayo or add some celery and green onions for crunch."
3,A travel staple; a bit bland,"I purchased these lemon pepper tuna kits after having purchased many of the spicy thai chili tuna kits. They provide the same convenience as other flavors in this line (small single-portion tuna can with packet of crackers, spread, and packaged crackers, all in a plastic crush-resistant box). This tuna does not have any corn syrup or artificial flavors or colors but does have modified food starch, which I usually prefer to avoid because it's one of those things that it's not clear what it is or how it was made. The thing I noticed when eating this tuna was that it didn't have much flavor. To me, a big point of these kits is that the tuna is seasoned. I didn't detect much seasoning. I have since added different things to add more flavor including black pepper, Simply Organic All Purpose Seasoning, garlic, crushed kale chips, and Crispy Red Peppers. They are convenient and for me, provide variety, but are by no means my favorite."
1,Don't bother with the Lemon Pepper,"While I like the other ones, specifically Thai Chili, which was great, this one tasted like a popular brand of furniture polish. Won't get this one again."
2,Whole Foods does not = Macrobiotics,"Whole Foods does not = Macrobiotics as this author has decided. Whole Foods includes meat, very heartily, as it is a ""whole food"". I planned on a book full of recipes including snacks, which are very hard to think of, and was disappointed. The copy is trite and recipes are not very helpful regardless."
1,Underwhelmed,"I bought this book because I am interested in cooking healthier and eating less meat. I wanted some ideas and good recipes I could incorporate into my family's lifestyle. I tried several recipes in this book, and I did not like any of them.One of the recipes, ""Tempeh-stuffed cabbage rolls"" were so bad that my husband and I threw them directly into the garbage. I am a great cook and my friends and family agree. I have never had so many kitchen disasters in my entire life as when I used the recipes in this book.I do not recommend this book. It makes cooking a chore and the result is barely edible."
2,Too weird for words,"The recipes in this book were just too bizarre for my tastes. And even if I would be willing to try some of them, there's no way I could get my husband and kids to eat these dishes. I couldn't even pronounce some of the ingredients used in her recipes, let alone find them in a grocery store. Perhaps the author's income allows her to buy exotic foods from a health food grocery store, but the average consumer (particularly one shopping for a family) cannot afford to spend that kind of money on groceries."
5,Healthful Food that You Could Actually See Eating,"I have sampled a number of recipes from this book and been quite happy with them. Many cookbooks offer healthful recipes, but this one, more than most, offers healthful recipes that are actually edible and have some character--mostly Italian. The scope is vegetables plus fish, so it offers an excellent guide for heart patients and those who cook for them."
4,A very goodcookbook to expand on the basic macrobiotic diet.,"This cookbook offers a great amount of variety of whole foods and preparation options compared to recipes I have in Macrobiotic cookbooks. All the recipes I have tried so far have all been good. One of the things I have learned about changing to a new way of eating is that it takes time to ajust to new foods and tastes. This is true for me with some of the foods, such as kale, so I continue to try different recipes, etc. until I find one I like. All the grain dishes have been very good, and pressure cooking brown rice has made it into a wonderful tasting rice. Thanks for a very good book."
2,Not Macrobiotic enough,"If your a vegetarian this book is good, But as far as macrobiotic?..........no way!!! Recipes contain GARLIC, are full of nightshades & other ingredients such as coconut milk, basil, orange juice, tropical vegetables, chilli, olives, cayenne, cougettes, peppers........I was pushed hard to find a macrobiotic recipe that was not too YIN......"
5,I am still digesting this book,This book is great for anyone who is interested in macrobiotic cooking. I am a beginner and feel totally at ease with the ways this book is written and layed out. The recipes are varied and very interesting. This book makes me feel like I could create my own macrobiotic recipes. After reviewing this cook book (which I am still doing) I felt as if I'd want to meet the author and take cooking classes from her. This is a great book to have around.
2,bad recipes ...a waste of money,I bought this book after seeing her PBS show and boy was I disappointed. A lot of the recipes could not have been tested. They are runny and doughs for cookies and breads don't hold together. I am really disappointed. I give it two starts because I would only make about 10 recipes from this book again. I wish I would have read the reviews before buying it. Her ingredients are pricy and you end up ruining the recipes. Don't pour all the liquid into the baked items start with a little at a time. Many dishes are really tasteless.
2,Not to sure,So far the time I have spent with this book has not been that satisfying. Either I am missing something or most of my favorite songs are not even transcribed in the right key. If you are a guitarist you might want to look elsewhere.
5,A Must,For The Musician or Fan of some of the Greatest Recorded songs in the history of Music as we know it this is a must.this is a Book that Matters when Words&Music Mattered as well.
4,It always drops a beat!,"It Definetley is worth 13 bucks! I mean, usually if you get a cd, theres only like at most 5 out of 14 songs that are good, but with this CD, its just constant enjoyment! All the songs are great, they sound tight, and the lyrics are tight! They hard to rap to, but once you listen to it for a while its so fun to rap along! If your going to get any ludacris CD's, this is the one to get! So relax yo hormones and keep yer drawers on! And chill wit ludacris! PEACE!"
3,Decent for a Beginner,"This is a goog book to get the basics. Some of the analogies are really good, but they seem to repeat them over and over. Decent reference though"
4,Useful reference,A very useful general reference; even thick textbooks usually list only a subset of these tests -- and not in a uniform reference.
4,Excellent,"Aucune démonstration mathématique mais ouvrage infiniment utile à avoir dans sa bibliothèque. Il y a effectivement 100 tests, avec des exemples complets, hypothèses de travail explicitées et interprétation des résultats. Que du bonheur! Le livre est relativement coteux mais l'achat en vaut vraiment la peine."
5,Excellent,"This was a required text for me at Walden University. I have not only used it in academia but in business, also. The range of possible statistical test which can be used is daunting to the non-statistician. If you are doing or reading research, look up the statistical test used in this book for a better understanding."
4,-I bought this book by curiosity in order to know more ...-,"One day I was obliged to abandon my course, the second of a suite of two course on Statistics, in a university and I was kind of curious to see how tests and statistical software applications evolved since Internet and software applications are now spread everywhere and in schools because I would still want to complete this course.I did not read this book entirely but I am rather amazed to see that some educators At LEAST understand that how-tos explained step-by-step are important when studying in a university because much work and readings have to be done in shorter time periods and there is less time to think of how to realize tests, claculations and whatever can be demanded by teachers. I am satisfied but cannot say more opinions for now."
4,Bent/Cult,"Interesting story for the discerning viewer, Early Clive Owen and special appearance of Mick Jagger in drag no less. Rather intense ending of cruelty to homosexuals by the Nazis."
5,An exceptionally well cast movie,"I have read some of the lengthier reviews for Bent, and I see they contain a galaxy of spoilers. I will just say that this English/Japanese production is one of the most powerful films I have seen - the casting is wonderful - Clive Owen is a revelation and Lothaire Bluteau - the French Canadian actor who starred in Jesus of Montreal gives a heart rending performance. As others have noted, the theatrical roots of this story are evident - but this is no bad thing. I think the production is excellent - from the scenes of decadent (pre-) war Berlin, to the atrocities committed on the train to Dachau to the harrowing scenes at the concentration camp itself. This is a film you will want to watch more than once - which is an extraordinary achievement given its confronting nature."
2,Short on Realism,"I'll be fair and say I only watched this film once and this critique is an initial response.The film falls short on realism. I found the sense of humor in Clive Owen's character weakens the overall seriousness of terror one would feel in concentration camps- exspecially when history books and documentaries exposed such bleak, morbid pictures of this ugly time period. The film editing doesn't pick up speed and has a dragging effect. However, the outdoor shots (buildings, ect.) add dimension and realism to the film. Overall, good attempt but needs polished."
5,"Evocative of a stage play, important material","The movie has been set to feel a bit more like a stage play than a film, but it works nonetheless. It covers the story of two gay men who meet in a Nazi death camp and a very inspiring if ultimately tragic love story. Gays and lesbians are the often-forgotten victims of the Holocaust, and this movie and the play it is based on are important, also, because of its contribution to Holocaust studies in general. Mick Jager's unusual appearance as a drag queen is also interesting. As a source of education, there is some sexual content that makes the film inappropriate for use in high school classrooms without a bit of editing, but I think unedited material is very well suited to a college classroom--and is essential viewing for anyone interested in the Holocaust. An important piece of GLBT heritage."
4,"Wonderful, stark, well-acted movie","Clive Owen and Lothaire Bluteau bring talent and personality to these two victims of the holocaust. In stark contrast, the beginning of the film shows ""gay"" Berlin (with a ghastly performance by Mick Jagger) in it's glory. Owen's character is full of lusts and life, oblivious to the woes that are so near his door. Until his fling with a soldier brings his and his lovers capture. Once the Nazis have him, Owen doesn't want the stigma of being a homosexual at the concentration camp so he admits to being a Jew. His friendship with Bluteau emerges while in the camp, soon growing to love, but nothing can change their tragic fate. A great film about the forgotten victims of the holocaust - the homosexuals."
1,I was expecting a good story...,"The premise grabbed me; it is about a gay man sent to the concentration camps during WWII. I was expecting some really good things from it; ""gay entertainment,"" as well as having the Nazi attrocities against gays highlighted for starters.To say I was disappointed would be an understatement; it's a bad sign when I wished the SS would just shoot the main character and make it a movie about his boyfriend instead! I despised the main character...he was everything I could possibly dislike about a person all rolled up into one.He's a multi-time cheater on the same person, a coke-head, a jerk, very promiscuous, makes (unwelcome) decisions for other people...throw in some domestic abuse and you've just about covered it.He's someone I'd be ashamed to know...needless to say, it was impossible to sympathize with his wretched character. And I can't say I'm happy with the clear stereotypes of ""gay life"" being portrayed from the very beginning."
2,no,"I saw this for Mick Jagger. And his small part is filmed awkwardly. And then the movie after is slow. If you're gay this will surely resonate more than it will for straights like me. I just wanted a good movie, not an ""important"" film. So I lost interest in it's leaden pace. Often plays translated to film fail, as this one did. Although Mick looks FABULOUS in a sequined dress."
5,Very dark and splendid,This film was full of darkness and hope. It was hard to see and easy to understand. The acting was great and the script was good. I enjoyed the film. It is not a film to see if you're on a first date but it is a good film to remind us of how good we have it in this day and age. It was a good investment and an addition to my collection.
4,Exceptional,"The rock pile scene is well worth the time spent watching the film. Move it here, move it there. I loved it."
2,Rocks in My Head,"At the films opening I really did not know what I had gotten myself into, then quickly the film takes a dramatic turn when a HOT SEXY GUY has a tragic run in with the Gestapo and our lead is on the run. The Movie had a couple of Very Powerful Scenes (train scene), there were times when the Dramatic Tension built to a Powerful Crescendo and some Strong Scene Structure, Scripting and Directing, however I really felt this movie did not reach its potential and I felt that Clive Owen performance was a bit weak. The Movie had much potential; however it fell a bit short of expectations."
4,Holocaust Romantic Tragedy,Romantic tragedy of the Holocaust as a Belgium Jew residing in the Berlin of the Nazi thirties was caught between his biology and ethnicity themselves sustain mortal threats in then Germany.It is better once watching than reading a dozen of reviews anyway.
3,Powerful depiction of lost soul learning power of love.,"A powerful, though somewhat stagey, film set in WWII Berlin. The depiction of decadence merely sets the scene for a loveless, soulless, lost man who, once captured and interred at Dachau, learns the meaning of love from a fellow gay prisoner he is not allowed to touch. Bluteau's supporting performance is stunning. Beware - cruelty, torture depicted. Beware for homophobes like the one who wrote the May 11 review on this page - love, tenderness, intimacy also depicted. Not for the tolerance challenged."
4,A different biography of an unknown prince,"Authors usually writes about famous people, kings and queens, politicians, artists, scientists, etc. This biography is different because is about the obscure and sad life of a young prince and his struggle with haemophilia. Prince Leopold lived always under the shadow of his powerful mother, Queen Victoria, who overprotected him because of his illness. As you read the book you get to know and love this shy and intelligent young prince. The book is interesting because the author gives us a theory about why the haemophilia gene appeared on Queen Victoria's genetic code. She analyses th Queen's genealogical tree on the female line and discovers that many of her female ancestors'sons died in infancy so they may had been haemophiliacs. This is a more interesting theory than that of thinking than Queen Victoria was an illegitimate child, not being the Duke of Kent's daughter but being the daughter of her mother's lover, who could have been an haemophiliac."
2,Prince Leopold: The Untold Story of Queen Victoria's...,"I have read many royal and historical biographies, but I must say that this book did not live up to my expectations. I found it written in an illogical manner, and could not keep my interest in it at all. I was very eager to read about things that had not come to light in other books, but everything I read about I have read in other books concerning Queen Victoria.TWO STARS"
1,Stinks to High Heavens!,"I'd rate this less than zero, if the rating system allowed me to. This is completely lousy book and a huge waste of money! Many facts are wrong, which is a disgrace for someone of Ms. Zeepvat's experience. Her writing is flat and uninspiring and almost anything of interest is obtained from other books about the subject. Personally I'm sick of all these royal books that are basically re-packaged versions of previous books."
2,A few unfunny bloopers....,"No bleeps. No bodyslams to remember. And the bloopers consist of Gorilla Monsoon messing up his lines maybe ten different times. Not saying something by accident instead of something else, but more him just messing up on the telepromter. The matches stink too. SKIP!!!!"
2,J.E. Meyer St. Louis,The cover looks nise and has given it some protection that I wanted. The one thing that I have found as being inconvenient is that the part covering the screen keeps sliding as you hold the phone while talking. This covers the ear receiver and muffles the persons voice of which you are talking. I bought it because I thought that the flexable connection would work better but found another problem. I am not buying another because of this.
2,the machiavelli covenant,"Why ""the jockeys"" were killed is never answered in this book of coincidence based contrivance. A good read if you're travelling in Siberia mid-winter by snowbound train."
3,I lke Folsom's work however,This book in the first half was traditional Folsom. I felt that the last half of the book drug out much too long.
1,Don't waste your time- Beyond Horrible,"If there was half a star available - that is what i would have given it just for the wasted paper that was used to print this book. The story line is so ridiculously far fetched - President of the US on the LAM due to world-wide conspiracy from a witch-like cult who has a mad scientist Dr. creating viruses that kills people while masking the fact that they were poisoned.Other annoying aspects of this book besides it being so far fetched:1. The President of the US and a civilian who befriended him calling each other 'COUSIN""2. Writing out the entire name and title of the characters who were in the conspiracy (it was a list that takes up practically a page!)3. So unbelievable (sorry can't let this part go)4. The unending and unnecessary details5. Timestamps of events occuring SECONDS apart! and with the same characters!Even though i paid $1 for this book during a used book sale, i still think i overpaid!I cannot believe people liked this book."
2,Don't Bother!,"How anyone can give this book a four or five star rating is beyond me. The only reason I gave it a two is that it does have an occasional moment of compelling action and a conspiracy scenario that in other hands might have been made into something semi-reasonable from a plot perspective.Even as fiction it is totally unbelievable, as are most of the characters. You alternately want to laugh or throw the book in a garbage heap. It really is a weird concoction of disjointed and ridiculous plot lines that all culminate in a rather predictable ending (which out of shear frustration I skipped ahead to read about half way through this way too long book).In summary--not on my recommended reading list."
3,Missed Potential,"This novel had the potential to be so much more. I found the story line interesting-enough to hold my interest until the end-but also too drawn out. Several times throughout the book, I found the author giving redundant descriptions of situations and conversations that occurred within the text. I also found the format to be awkward-chapter breaks in places for each minute or two of action, chopping the text into one and two sentence bites. This is a cheap, artificial way of building suspense and totally unnecessary. The body of the story was gripping and reminiscent of Robert Ludlum's novels, but tended to drag on too much. I feel the book should have ended much sooner and with a better finish. The ending was a disappointment and another example of cheap tactics to hold interest."
3,So So....,I have really enjoyed a couple of Folsom's books but lately they have been disappointing. This book at best is so-so. The story is interesting but not engaging enough to keep your attention for 500+ pages. It was entertaining at points but by the end I was just trying to get through it. Not recommended....
2,"oh no, what's happened to him?","When I started reading Allan Folsom's THE EXILE, I couldn't put it down...when I did (after reading it in two marathon sessions) I ran out and purchased (not at Amazon but at full retail price) THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW and THE CONFESSION.I was amazed by his intricate plotting, the continued surprise twists, the breakneck pacing. Here was an author who was a clear master of the genre - imaginative, facile, talented.Sadly, The Machiavelli Covenant was disappointing. I kept waiting for it to take off, and it never did. I was 200 pages into it and I asked myself ""When is this going to start"" It was interesting, but didn't generate the excitment his other books did.I will definately read his next book when it comes out, I'm just not salivating for its pub date."
5,Hard to put down!,"This was a fast paced, that kept me up reading until the early morning hours. I couldn't put it down! And, given the current political climate around the world, I found the book particularly pertinent and through provoking!"
2,Lazy effort,"I suspected that the book was lazily written due to some plotting issues and repitition. However, the horrendous translations confirmed my analysis. Beyond bad, they actually made me laugh out loud. Free translation services are not advisable.""Mosca encima"" does not translate ""Fly over"" except in the most literal sense. It means fly (insect) above! The jarringly bad translations made this novel difficult to take seriously. It is just too easy to get a valid translation.Having said that, Mr. Folsom did keep my attention well enough that I read to the end. It was tough going at times to finish the novel."
5,Fast paced thriller!,I could not read fast enough. It grabs you and puts you right in the middle. This was right along the lines of Angels & Demons and Da Vinci Code; a book you just don't want to stop reading. I found it very interesting that I could look up the locations in which are referred to in the book and get a better visualization of the images so brilliantly written of throughout the novel. This made the book that much more intense! It is a must read!
2,Someone Please - Get This Man a Copyeditor!,"Amid other chronically annoying grammatical and style errors, the author's repeated use of the description of someone speaking ""in a sotto voice"" rather than ""sotto voce"" was one that fairly leapt off the page. Add to the poor writing a plot with numerous unbelievable twists, characters who often behave in ways that make no sense, and a ""setup for the sequel"" ending unworthy of even my 7th-grade daughter's stories . . .The book is readable, if only as a way to kill time, because the characters are generally well-drawn and engaging. If you're expecting anything more, I think you'll be disappointed."
1,Truly ROTTEN!!,"Whew! The fact that a book as wretched as this can receive favorable reviews from so many sources has given hope to my own literary aspirations!I was a minor fan of Folsom's until I had to suffer through this latest endevor. Previous reviewers have this book nailed - the characters are wooden and completely unbelievable. The premise is ridiculous. We have the president of the USA running around with a former cop turned gardener who uncovers a major plot based on a few whispers from a dying friend.The plot does not develop in a natural way, but is forced and amazingly contrived through countless repetitive discussions, memories, and deducements from the poorly drawn characters. The writing is lousy. If I have to read one more ""conversation"" between ""Richard"" and ""Victor,"" I'll shoot myself.Spare yourself this read - go get a root canal instead!"
1,One of the worst books ever written,I patiently suffered through 531 pages (out of 690) before I through the book in the trash. I kept hoping that the repetitive tedium would eventually turn into something interesting. I would recommend that you avoid this author.
4,Really a page turner,I was hooked right from the beginning and should hardly put the book down until I read it. The plot is fresh and intriguing. Great job Allan. Keep it up.
1,Herkimer diamonds: A complete guide for the prospector by Barry S. Moore,Absolutely the worst scource of information on the subject. A book to misinform the uninformed.
2,Dependable when running but problems galore,Nifty economical Multifunction machine. The problems though are plentiful - the driver may not work right and you get pages and pages of junk. The trays have these plastic clips that hold them in place that drop real easily.I would definitely recommend dropping a few more dollars and getting an HP or a Dell instead.
5,thicken up,this is a great product it is just modified corn starch. It has no flavor and is great with food and drinks hot and cold.
5,A must have for all true Black Oak Arkansas fans!,This is a great book for anyone that really understands Black Oak Arkansas. Jim Dandy and the boys started the whole hard rock movement of the 80s. Find out where it all started. A must have book for all true Oakheads. This should be a TV movie.
3,A mixed bag,"This is a compilation of a number of bands that Mac MacLeod played in. It's inconsistant, but there are some very good moments. The highlight is ""Telescope"", a wonderful pervy pop song (it's about a peeping tom praising Galileo for the invention of the telescope!) by an early version of Argent that sounds much more like the Zombies than by the arena-rock band that did ""Hold Your Head Up"". If you're a Zombies fan who also loves Pink Floyd's ""Arnold Layne"", you need to buy this cd just for ""Telescope"". According to the liner notes, there are other recordings by this version of Argent. I hope they'll be released soon."
5,It is indeed Splendid!,"As Americans living in Italy, my husband & I have used Fred Plotkin's _Italy for the Gourmet Traveller_ as a guidebook when travelling throughout Italy. It has never disappointed us yet. Now we have added this *wonderful* book to our collection. More than a cookbook, this book explores the history and culture of the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region (where we, quite luckily, happen to live), as well as the cuisine. There are great explanations of the region's different ingredients, herbs & spices, wines, cheeses, coffee, grappa, as well as travel information and sources for some of the harder-to-find ingredients. And then, of course, there are all of the great recipes, each with an author's note (and usually a wine suggestion)! Now I feel doubly fortunate--to have had the chance to live in this region, and also to have acquired this book so I can re-create a little bit of Friuli when we leave."
5,Great Read & Great Recipes,Informative book with great recipes and lots of interesting facts about this region of Italy.
5,Great CD to have!,"A truly great CD to add to your collection! Sleeper's quartet is trully a masterpiece! It's good to know there are composers like him, who can write in a modern idiom and at the same time keep the intensity, passion and fury of a more romantic age."
4,Casio KL-100 Label It printer,"I have owned this little gem for about two years. I used it to label computer network peripherals, however, I found lots of other uses for it at home. I carrie it back and forth between work and home until I decided to purchase a second unit. The KL-100 is extremely easy to use and is very durable. My only complaint is the relatively high cost of the tapes that are available."
1,never worked from the get go,poor quality which may be why it is no longer manufactured. Actually caught the label tape on fire at first use.
4,Ugghhh Literature,I'm an Ashford University student and I used this book for my Lit class. There was maybe one or two that were not in the custom edition and I was able to find them online. It was a great deal less than the custom book! Gld I went this route!
4,Relaxing Reading,"I used this text for a class that I had to take. I have never been a Literature lover, but this book turned that all around. I'm in awe of Literature and ny apetite for reding has increased. I got a B in the course!Thanks"
5,Excellent!!,It's a very good book. It has totally enlightened me on the various types of literature that exists. I had to purchase this book for my English Composition III Course at College but it was well worth the purchase.
5,Fast and Timely,The book arrived in great condition and in a very timely manner. I would purchase from this seller in the future.
4,New student,"I was a new student this year and purchasing books was just as new. I was grateful to be able to purchase my books online and for less money. I do wish however that I would have been aware of the previous marked or highlighted sections within the book, as they had bled through the pages. I did however recievd my books in a very timely manner and for that reason alone I would purchase from this seller again or in the future.Thank You so much!!"
3,Second Edition,"This product is the second edition, not the sixth which is what I was expecting when I purchased it. It was in great condition, but just make sure it is the edition you are looking for."
5,Excellent,"Product was in excellent condition, i received it before the end date, and was very happy with my purchase!"
2,Not what I expected,"I wonder how this Second Edition book was associated with the ISBN that I entered? I needed the SIXTH Ed., so I guess I've been had. Book should have been priced for being so out-of-date that I won't even be able to resell in good conscience."
5,Awesome book.,"I have never felt so engaged while reading assignments from a literature book! The stories in it are all interesting and thought-provoking, and I also like the make of the book (the way it's thicker but shorter/narrower than other books). It was also shipped in good timing before school started, so I was able to start my Lit assignments ahead of time. If you need to take an English class, I highly recommend the AP/college course that uses this book!"
4,Oops,"I bought this book instead of buying the 2nd edition. I figured it would be exactly the same. It isn't. It has a lot of the same stories but some are missing, like ""The Lottery."" Luckily it's a book of short stories, so the stories that are missing you can get online. The price is worth the work. It's half the price of the new book. A paper back book is not worth 58 dollars. Buy this look up the other stories.Plus it's easy to navigate."
4,room enough for friends,I was truly amazed at the size of the box and the size of this playhouse. The screened porch makes it quite special. It takes up a great deal of room and most will probably need to set this up outside. You will need tent stakes which are not included.
5,The BEST money I've spent in a long time!,"I just gave this to my 2 year old son for his birthday and he and my daughter (age 4) have been playing with it NON-STOP. It is a HUGE hit! We have it set up inside, but you could easily have it setup outside, too. It is perfect, because you can have the screen room up (we do- and it's so much fun!) or- if space is a concern, you can have the screen room folded up and attached to the side. This is a great product!! Highly recommend!"
4,Great Playhut,My 3 girls use this Playhut every single day. It's big and airy and we can take it anywhere. LOVE IT!
2,Too Big,"This item is too big. We looked a variety of play houses before we selected this one based on it's appearance and design. However, when we opened this item Christmas morning, it is so large it took up the entire room. It is so large the we do not open the screened porch section. We would have been much better served by a smaller play house. This item is also very tricky to put away. It is supposed to be 3 simple steps to return it to it's carrying bag, but it was anything but simple. A number of people tried to follow the directions to return it to its orgnial size and shape, however after many attempts we only managed to get it close. It still hangs out the the bag and makes the handles useless."
2,Loads of fun!,"My kids love this play tent and so do I. I love that the tent can be folded up, so you only have the house out. We also bought the 5' tube that connects to it. I thought it would be a little bigger around, but kids fit in it just fine. I found folding it up was very easy. It only took two tries and within 15 minutes it was in it's bag. GREAT TENT!!!"
3,playhut,I bought this playhut for my graddaughter for her 4th birthday and she loves it. I like the fact that it is big enough for many kids. The only thing that I dislike about the playhut is that the more it has to be reassembled the more warped the playhut becomes. So if anyone intends to take this playhut down often I would suggest putting the playhouse outside rather than inside.
4,Luxury House Play Tent,"My neices love their new luxury house and have set up a kitchen in the main part and a bedroom in the sceen room. Their old one did not have a screen room, so they think this one is pretty cool!"
5,"Fun, Fun, Fun!!","I ordered this playhouse a few weeks ago for my 3 year old and 18 month old. They love it. The 3 yr. old wants to sleep in it every night. We read books in it, have tea in the screened in patio, play with toys in it. It is a great playhouse that can go outside or in and can travel!!I also had trouble getting it to fold down compactly. I called 1-888-PLAYHUT and they walked me through it over the phone. It is so easy, the written directions are hard to follow. The customer service department was very friendly and helpful."
4,Great BIG fun!!!,"I bought this for my 3 yr old daughter .. and to my surprise its big enough for my 3 yr old, 5 yr old and 9 yr old ... and their cousins!! It is a great challenge to fold down, but when you fold it once it gets easier each time. Great for camping, the beach and backyard fun!!! We're a big fan of Playhut and this house is the best especially for summer!!"
5,AWESOME PLAY HUT,"I must say this is the best play hut ever!!!!It is HUGE!!!!!!!Lots of space.You can fit 8 or more kids in there.Even a Child sofa couch.It is so cool!!!! Easy to put together and to store back in bag.Not hard at all.My children 13,10,6 and 16 months love it.I even put the pit balls in there.You will need at least 400 balls to fill one side of the play hut.I even can fit in there.You also can fold half of the house to make it smaller.I say this is the best hut ever made yet!!!!!!Worth every cent i spent for it,and then some."
5,This book is a life changer!,"Gail Hayes' description of my image type was right on target. Her insight into the drama, dress, and drive of my image type have released me to be the woman God meant me to be. If you're tired of trying to conform yourself and still not fitting the bill--be something even better, a Daughter of the King! Ignore any negative reviews and rush to order as if your life depends on it. It does! You'll never look at yourself the same way again."
5,Panzermeyer,"This is a great book for anyone wanting insight on the 12th SS and the Leibstandarte. Meyer does a great job of redefining what an SS soldier was, compared the what the Western allies sterotyped them as. If you would like an on the ground perspective combined with and a commanding officer insight, this hits both levels. Meyer went from Panzerjaeger company commander, to the leader of the 12th SS ""Hitlerjugend"" Panzergrenadier Division. This is a must for a German WWII history buff."
3,Biaised but not without interest,"If you want to learn more about Panzermeyer you should read this book: ""Meeting of Generals"" by T. Foster. The lives of Kurt Meyer and Canadian general Foster narrated in parallel until they confronted each other on the battlefield in Normandy and after that in a military tribunal.The W-SS officer Kurt Meyer was at the head of units that had no inclination for rounding up soviet POWs (not always ...) and that later executed Canadian soldiers in cold blood after a fair fight (if such fights exist), long after the combat and capture.A brave soldier he was, daring, yes that too. This officer was nevertheless captured in september 1944 hiding in a pig pen, by Belgian civilians that were not even members of the resistance.Just to put things right ...(funny how some ss fans are reluctant to admit or even acknowledge the way their hero was captured. At the end of the day history is just not compatible with fantasy)"
4,Compelling,I read this book within 3 days and found it an exceptional view from the other side of the hedgerow! If you are interested in the personal aspects of elite soldiers and the tough decisions that have to be made on the spot - this is the book for you. I gave it 4 stars because it lacked MAPS! I don't know about other readers but I read the text and maps side by side. Enjoy.
2,Scattered War History,"This book is a rough, unconnected bunch of after action reports. It does not have a narrative, linear story to connect the many interesting and exciting battles together. It is written as a first person view of what was happening within this one officer's eyes on a very small scale and has none of the sweep, suspense or bigger story of the battles he describes. Roughly half the book reads like ""the 12.SS was withdrawn and the 4.PG was pushed foward."" If you want to know about the SS, or tanks, or the battles in Russia, there are much better books by professional historians that will introduce you to the many characters, plans, and other interesting matters. I would skip this one."
3,Encoding errors...,"While I enjoyed Panzermeyer's memoir and the numerous photographs, this edition has annoying and confusing character encoding errors all over the place.The word ""Panzerfäuste"", for example, is on numerous occasions printed as ""Panzerf,uste"".These sort of encoding errors are scattered all over the book, sometimes with numerous examples occuring on a single page, or even in the same paragraph.I am reluctant to try another book from this publisher - the book itself is well made, the paper is clean and bright and the text is easy to see and read... But encoding issues? Makes this look like a cheap cut-and-paste."
3,"A good read, but biased.","Worth a read, but as in most German military memoirs of the period, heavily biased and full of ""selective memory"", when it comes to unpleasant facts, and chooses to ignore them completely or gloss them over.I.e., Meyer has a habit of being being sure to mention/criticize poor treatment he/his men received via the Allies, while not a word is mentioned of the far greater German examples of the same.Worth a read. Just take it with a (large) grain of salt."
2,stop this diseased adulation,"Reviewer is fed up with the adulation heaped on WW2 Nazis. They fought in the worst cause in modern history (with the Confederates of the American Civil War a close second), slaughtered scores of millions of people and should all have been hanged. The overwhelming majority of WW2 books are written from the pro-Nazi point of view, fueled by the Cold War hysteria.A fine example of instant whitewash is Werner Von Braun: from SS Major to icon of NASA. Never mind the 10,000 defenseless civilians his rockets killed, or even worse, 10,000 more who died in slave camps to build his rockets.There was nothing noble or partiotic about such beasts in human form.The only value of the memoirs of these vicious thugs is for us to identify them much quicker before the next generation rises up again. Would you prefer that the Nazis had won? We are well rid of them. If you want to read more serious WW2 history from military analyst point of view, try David Glantz, many titles."
3,Very good but some weak points,"Overall, the book is a good presentation of the German side of the battles in which Meyer took part. It gives an excellent view of the war on the front lines. Its weakness is Meyer's stopping to rant about the mistreatment of the SS soldiers by the Allies and his own government after the war. The book would rate 5 stars from me if it were not for the periodic rants, especially in the later parts of the book. He accomplishes more in showing the true nature of the majority of the front line SS soldiers by presenting a first-hand account of the events from the SS side than all of the rants accomplish. The rants are more of a distraction than anything."
4,"Great picture, but it doesn't have full horizontal resolution","This set has 1280 x 1080 pixels and not the full 1920 x 1080 that a full 1080p set has.Although this set doesn't have the same black levels and clarity of the full 1080p plasma sets coming out now from Pioneer and Panasonic, the colour levels are accurate and deep.Hitachi's plasmas also rank well with Consumer Reports for reliability, but at this price you might not care.If you don't have the money to fork out for a full 1080p plasma, you will probably not want to look much further than this set."
1,Good luck with longevity,"First the good points - I loved the picture. My version had a swivel pedestal for around the room viewing. I was perfectly happy with the television while it worked. But...One year and 3 months after I purchased it the lower drive board blew out. Of course, the warranty was only 1 year. After I replaced the board, BOTH the upper and lower boards blew out 30 days later. My TV repairman states the plasma screen is defective and any cost of repair is greater than the price of the unit. Hitachi customer service is completely unsympathetic. I will not buy a Hitachi again."
3,Know what you are getting,"This book is fine, but I wish I had known in advance what the the author was trying to accomplish. With the exception of ""Blackbird"", the book does not help you to play the guitar parts you might be familiar with from recordings. Instead, the music in the book transcribes the vocal melodies we are all familiar with on top of simple finger picked chord arpeggios. The end result is music that might be closely associated with elevators and weddings. Depending on your audience this can be OK, but it can also sound very cheesy. Also, note that the keys of many songs have been changed in order to allow playing the music in this manner."
5,great book,"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my 15 year old grandson. I was very impressed with the book for the price. Not knowing much about guitar, I can't comment for myself, but he is an intermediate player and loves it."
3,HALF-BAKED TUTORIAL,"In essence this is a not-to-be-missed reference material especially for those players growing up in Beatles era.Most likely the arrangements seem to be designed for ""below intermediate"" fingerstyle practitioners and the absence of accompanying CD makes it less attractive to potential novice customers."
2,Accurate But Not Impressive,"This book has 30 Beatles songs all of which are great songs and the tabbing is very accurate. But if you are trying to learn songs to impress an audience this book is extremely worthless. A lot of the songs don't even consist of double plucking just a few bass notes spaced out but it doesnt sound extraordinary. Go on Youtube and search PER-OLOV KINDGREN He finger styles Beatles songs such as ""something"" and ""And I love her"". When I purchased this book I was expecting something along the lines of his work and it fell extremely short of that."
2,Arrangements not particularly well written,"I feel like these arrangements are dumbed down to the point where they lose the character of the songs. And there are a lot of things like middle voices or a more complete bass line that would have not made the song terribly more difficult to play, but would have made it sound much better. Overall I find the arrangements lazy."
2,"Not accurate, Not a good book",This book is not accurate. Most of the chords are totally different than the real songs and are in different keys. You could not play most of the songs using the book in sync with the recordings. It is mostly arpeggios and some fills. The book does not really contain fingerpicking compositions that would stand alone. Some of the selections in the book are not suitable for acoustic guitar fingerpicking. Makes you wonder why they were chosen.
3,Not suitable for fingerpicking learners,"I would have called myself an advanced beginner or intermediate guitarist, trying to teach myself fingerpicking. I've used a couple of different books, but found this one quite difficult to use. It has tabs for the fingerpicking arrangement, but they don't really correspond to the chords that are listed, so you have to figure out each one almost finger by finger. Might be better for working with a teacher."
5,So you want to spray,"I needed a sprayer for weed control. I knew I needed a high quality stainless sprayer. Aster talking to a few people I decided to give the Chapin 3 gallon a try. So far it works great. I have been using it for a few months and it has worked flawlessly. Every time I use it there is never a problem. I dragged it up a hill and almost dropped it, I grabbed it by the sprayer and it did not break. Then it got away from me and fell. Still works. Then I left it outside for a month without clearing the spout. It still works. This is a great sprayer for someone who is rough on equipment. The nozzle is adjustable and can spray quite a few feet away from you. Easy to pump and lock. A good deal. I recommend it."
5,Formerly Disappointed,"After the initial pre-use check, the sprayer was inoperable. It would not turn into the Lock Pump position, so would not seal. Very disappointing, as this pump was not inexpensive. Contacted Chapin and got immediate and very helpful customer support, including follow up. I could not have been more shocked; not that the sprayer could be fixed, but that there are still American based manufacturers providing excellent products and customer service. We've all learned to settle for flimsy junk produced by hordes of Chinese toddlers. I admit, when the sprayer wouldn't close, my first response was to post a negative product review, as this has become the only recourse for dissatisfied consumers in the US. In this case, my bad. This is an excellent product, made in the US, with fantastic customer support. Do not hesitate to purchase any products from Chapin Mfg."
1,Softwear,"We have had the Brother multifunction 7300 C, for about 10 months. We have never gotten it to work. The soft wear for the printer does not work. I have downloaded it from Brother on the internet and it still does not work. The copier and the fax will work but nothing else works. Abosolutely nothing works from the PC.Thank YouGeo"
1,think twice,"Hi, just got this as a present and after 2 days of frustration its going back .. poor quality through-out .... hard to use .. and don't get me started on the instructions ...I'd say to ... - STOP selling it!"
4,You get what you pay for...,"I've had this mfc for 8 months now and after reading some of the other reviews I had to go back and check the model number to see if this was the same machine. Lighten up people.Every computer user should know by now that multi-function machines are strictly compromises. None of the features, generally speaking, is as good as the stand-alone single-function machine. And, when you pay as little as this mfc costs, your expectations should drop a bit more.I've found this machine to be more than adequate in each of its functions. Print quality is surprisingly good, although it must be said that you go through replacement ink cartridges fairly quickly -- too small.It's a compromise. It's fairly small and takes less space than any two of the machines it replaces. If you're realistic in your expectations you'll find this to be a good, inexpensive mfc. It's easy to use, too!"
2,Great door stop!,"This is a modified sewing machine.Slow, frustrating, and poor in quality on all levels, its a staggering achievemnt in poorly designed machinery. I wouldnt recommend this to anyone who wishes to have intelligible printouts, or a machine that can print more than 1 page an hour.Dont buy this under any conditions!"
4,A different view of the roles,This scholar's elucidation of these three roles in Hebrew tadition is a thorough analysis of biblical texts in regards to the three roles. Each title has a full section devoted to his understanding of what their functions were and he points out where there are problemmatic passages or unclear facets of their respective duties or responsibilities. Their cultural roles and how they developed over time is also covered very well.
5,Great Product,My 92 year old mother can't hear the phone ring when she is watching tveven with the phone next to her chair. She just wont wear her hearing aids all the time. Now she can hear the phone ring even when she is out of the room and not using her hearing aids. Great product Great price
1,impossible,started it during hurricane sandy and was only able to get the outline done. Gave up after three weeks of attempting it.
3,You need prior knowledge,"This book is an outline of the Intermediate Accounting course. It gives brief descriptions of the basic accounting concepts along with many examples and exercises. It requires prior knowledge of accounting as the descriptions are too short for a beginner. But if this is what you want then this is a good and wellwritten book.If you are new to accounting this book should not be your main source. Instead you may want to buy a previous edition of a larger accounting textbook which can be bought preowned at a substantial discount to the newest edition. If you are completely new to accounting I also recommend starting with the book: Financial Statements by Thomas Ittelson, which is a very good introduction to accounting.So depending on what you already know about accounting and what you want to find out this may be a good or a bad book for you ...PS: This review is for the 2nd edition."
2,Dissapointing,"Very little of the documentary seems to focus on the years before they started making films. They speak very little about Gummo, or why Zeppo left the act after Duck Soup. There seems to be an imbalanced amount of focus on the ""You Bet Your Life"" period for Groucho.There is some very interesting scenes of early test shots of one of their Broadway plays that was never made to film, as well as test shooting for a television show that was never made. Also, there are some fascinating facts about their lives; but as documentaries go this one is poorly edited and incomplete."
1,The Unknown Marx Brothers,"It started out strong...for the first ten minutes. It would bring up topics, but would not follow through with the complete story or visuals. More film footage is needed. Especially when Harpo talked at his retirement show. It had an out of order sequence of events. Also, it did not state when each brother passed away. Overall it was a big disappointment."
3,Geart Documentary but Incomplete on DVD,"This is a great documentary, but the DVD has severly edited the documentary that was show on PBS. I have the whole documentary on tape and this is not it. The DVD leaves out the WWI years and a lot of the later films. Why? I don't know, but be warned, if you have seen the documentary before, this DVD is an edited version."
3,A real disappointment,"One expects the DVD version of a documentary to be complete. This is not.The package states that the running time is approximately 2:06, which is the length of the original program. This DVD runs for only 1:26, meaning that almost exactly one-third of the material was omitted! It's a shame, because in its full version this is a wonderful documentary on the brothers Marx. (I would be giving it 5 stars if it were complete.)One other cautionary note: this is not the PBS documentary on the Marxes cited in other reviews (that one is ""The Marx Brothers in a Nutshell"" and is well worth purchasing). This program originally aired (in two parts) on The Disney Channel."
2,"Fixed old problems, created new one.","The Current version of this device is VRFM8, which adds last song and last station recall, which fixes the complaints of some previous reviews about the unit starting over at the first song every time you start the car. Unfortunately, the unit I received plays with significant static on all 14 channels, and I tried it in 3 different vehicles with the same result. Not recommended unless you don't mind some low-level snap-crackle-pop with your music."
5,Addendum to previous reviews.,Only 128kb compression or lower can be decoded by this device at present. The primary complaint I've read by others is that there is no memory when the engine is shut down. My solution was to wire the lighter plug directly instead of the switched one provided and hit the stop (I call it pause) when you leave the vehicle. When you return press the stop/pause again and it continues from there. I think this is a very cool gadget and it can go to any vehicle in seconds. A well spent 30 bucks in my opinion!!
1,Horrible. Do not purchase!,"This item was a total bust. Sound quality is lousy, reception is poor, and you can barely hear your music come through. It's cheaply made and is obvious once you see the package it comes in and the product itself. I would return it but by time I paid return shipping I'd only get a few dollars back. Not worth it in any way."
3,mmm.. it works,"It works well. Before purchase, when I read the reviews people mentioned that it starts from where it stopped. However it is not true.This makes little bit frustration. Does it has any adjustment to start from where it stopped?!!!!!"
1,"Started out well, but now I keep blowing the fuse...","Tried it in two different cars, same result. Even though I replaced with the exact 1/2 amp fuse, it blows as soon as I plug in. I even checked the voltage to make sure it was at 12 volts."
1,Low quality,"The modulator works but the sound is fuzzy or muted, am very disappointed With it's reproduction and wish it could be replaced or returned."
2,Fair for what it is:,This gadget works fair......has poor sound quality. I suppose I can't expect too good of a sound quality for what I paid. I don't know if the higher priced ones are any better.
1,constant static,purchased from walmart terrible reception. Ordered from mach speed technologies fm transmitter with remote that works great no static like the roadmaster unit. and it was cheaper with remote to boot.
2,....ok,"I only paid $20 so it might be worth that, but the quality is not good. It basically sounds like a radio station that isnt coming in that clear. But other than that it works fine :). I doubt i will use it much."
3,So-so,"An inexpensive device to help get MP3's to play on your car radio. Only a small range of frequencies for it to work with on the radio. I tried it tonight and it played without static on the lowest frequency. Sound quality is very tunnel sounding. With a 1 gig Sandisk stick, I found the gain was poor, so if you tried to turn it up to a decent volume, it would distort on the low end. I plugged in my Creative Zen, and it has it's own gain, so I'm sure it will sound better, but, since the Zen has an EQ and it's set for good sound with earbuds, it pumps out too much base for this device. So, I would have to fool with the EQ settings. (I didn't spend allot of time with it.). But, since my Zen will play audio books like a champ, and I like to use it for long drives, without burning and changing 10 CDs, I think the device will come in very handy."
4,Very good value if you get a deal on it.,"Pros: Can play songs directly from a flash drive instead of an mp3 playerCons: Can't shuffle tracks or make a playlist if you use a flash driveOverall I'm very happy with this device. I live in a big city and had no trouble finding an FM station with little to no interference. I love being able to play tracks directly from a flash drive without having to bring my mp3 player with me in the car all the time. The sound quality is good, but not perfect. Similar to playing a cassette instead of a CD. I got it for cheap, so I'm not complaining.UPDATE: I see the Amazon price has more than doubled since I bought mine in early 2007! It's not such a great value anymore, although it looks like the deals in the ""used & new"" section are more consistent with what I'd expect."
2,Disappointed,This product does not produce a clear sound. The connection emits static and can be annoying to listen to. We ordered two of these and they both have had the same results.
4,Generic transmitter for generic mp3 players.,"If you have an iPod, Sansa, or any other popular, name-brand mp3 player, then this probably isn't the transmitter for you. What's good about this transmitter is that it does have decent sound quality, considering its size and the range of FM stations that it broadcasts. It does have a 2.5 mm audio input jack. (It would have been more useful if it were a 3.5 mm audio input jack.)Pretty much, though, what you see is what you get. Remember that it's for mp3 players, and not for flash drives. Just because you can store mp3 files on a USB flash drive does not mean that it contains the instructions to transmit music through the FM transmitter. All in all, it's not the best and it's not the worst. For the price, if you have one of those no-name mp3 players, this could be what you're looking for. Also, do make sure that you read the instructions and convert mp3 files to the appropriate KHz rating for optimal playback."
4,A gadget worth keeping,"I bought this couple of months back and i find it a really good gadget. about it plays from 1st song everytime, i didnt ecounter that, for me it plays from the last unfinished song each time i start the car. i have a 512mb flash and it plays just fine.But yeah, sometimes i do get a littl disturbance but it fades out slowly.Overall this is a pretty good device. It will save your money for the cd player and also burning cds as all u got to do is copy new songs to your usb flash."
4,Worth a second look,"This movie has many threads running through it. What I liked the best was how it switches back and forth between Germany and Taiwan, past and present. It also has themes of Taiwanese supernatural, Chinese mafia, family ties and betrayal, lesbian relations, grief, and guilt. I gave this movie 4 stars because any writer/director/producer who would attempt so many themes and locations gets four stars just for ambition. The movie also juxtaposes complex visual texture and beauty with modern starkness. There are a lot of hints in the beginning about what's going on, but I never get hints. I was one of those people who was truly surprised when Bruce Willis turned out to be a ghost in Sixth Sense. Now you have the hint about this movie."
3,Good movie,"My review is about the review done by James A. Reynolds III. All of his reviews are worthless. He never gives insight about the game, movie, book, etc. He just spews the same Taliban-like crap from right-wing conservative morons. Leave your political views out of the reviews. If you want to continue to make these stupid remarks, go to Foxnews.com. Fox news - they lie & you comply."
3,Born Losers,"The only good billy jack movie of them all!Born Losers(1967) is the introduction of ""Billy Jack"".The best biker film to me is HELLS ANGELS 69' not Easy Rider. Born Losers gets three stars because it's a good decent biker film, and because it hasn't been tainted yet by the moronic hippies seen in subsequent billy jack movies."
5,A Camp Classic,"I felt compelled to add a few thoughts to the feverish customer reviews already written. I give this movie a five-star rating, but for very different reasons than my fellow reviewers. Born Losers is a camp classic, a movie that's so bad, it's good. It has practically no production values, terrible acting, and a script that may have taken less time to write than the total running time of the movie. But compelling - man, is this movie compelling."
5,Born Losers [VHS],Great vintage movie and a very good price. All Bikers like all Biker movies. I would recommend this movie to all Bikers.
5,Born Losers,"My husband just loves Billy Jack. The movie brought back many happy childhood memories. ""Rooting for the underdog never gets old"" he says!"
4,Born Losers Review,A powerful dynamic drama ahead of it's time (1967). I first saw it 30years ago - it has lost none of its impact !
2,Agents of the Sun,"I have seen Agents from close to the beginning in the baltimore area and have been to many shows and practices. They are very good for a local band for sure, but on a national level really fall short.First off, almost every song sounds the same-very similar vocal paterns on every song, same song structure, same dynamics ect...there was really no need to write more than one song.They fall in with the generic radio nu-metalish (on the way light-side though) crowd but their music seems even more annoying than most of that crap. Bands like Trust Company, Trapt, Smile Empty Soul, Evanessence, Linkin Park eat Agents alive on any given day. Don't waste your time."
1,disgracefull at best,"look people i will quote the earlier reveiwer with ""Did you get your lyrics from Dr.Suess?"" if you have never heard good songwriting or have been in a cave the last seven years, you might find the cd listenable, but if you listen to their single (Come Together) you'll realize that repeating two phrases over and over and over and over again don't make good songs, unfortunatly these guys got signed, if your looking for a much more artistic hard rock act look the way of Oddzar, a much more original band also signed to DCide records."
1,"A mediocre 311, and that's a compliment.","Decided to check out this cd because a friend of mine saw this band in concert and she had said that they were decent for a local band. There is really nothing original about this 311 meets Incubus sounding band. In fact, the vocalist tries real hard to sound like 311's lead singer and fails miserably. The guitars are far from being heavy (as my friend suggested) and the vocal harmonies are just average (stick with 2 part harmonies my friends). The lyrics sound like they were written by a 10 year old. The first track on the cd isn't bad, but i'd definetely suggest checking out 311 before Agents of the Sun. The search for a decent Maryland band continues."
4,Big Band album with a twist,"Just like the title suggests, you have three different ensembles: big band, quintet and vocal. Although I am not a fan of the vocal tunes on this album, Tom Boras has a command of every ensemble...he is a commanding arranger for every configuration, I just wish there were more tunes arranged for Big Band on this album. I can only hope he follows this release with another. Highly Recommended!"
3,Glencoe Literature,purchased a used book and was very satisfied with quality for the inexpensive price. I would definately purchase again from this vendor.
5,english book,I guess it was a good book to use. Its just that it was used in school and im not a real fan of school or english subject by that chance.
5,Glencoe Literature Course 4 textbook,"The book was advertised as used. It arrived with no problems. It was in good shape, as advertised. It was a great deal for $3.00 !! Saved me a LOT of money, and the book is fine to use for studying. Reccommend this seller"
1,didn't fit,"The item was order for the same vehicle as the muffler. The muffler fit, but the tailpipe didn't come close to fitting"
4,Superb!,"Superb! From beginning to end: awesome! Melotron are a force and phenomenon who know what to do to get you to bust a move or two. Now this is Industrial Dance! Just when you think Andy Krueger, Kay Hildebrandt and Edgar Slatnow can't take you any higher in ""Folge mir ins Licht"", Julia Beyer joins in with the voice of an angel gracing you with German light!"
3,Not as good as I had hoped.,"I bought this because I had learned that the sampling from Ministry's ""So What"" was from this movie and had hoped that the movie would be as good as the song. I was disappointed; however, the movie was worth watching (I guess), since it was short anyway."
2,The Violent Years,"Well, all in all I should known what to expect. Early '50s, classic cars, violence that would be rated ""G"" today, but an interesting and fun snapshot in time for those who were putzing around then. Probably would not watch again, but then the price was right!"
3,Almost Perfect,When I bought this ring it was a size 8. Its a lot bulkier than most other rings which turns that size 8 to about a size 10 or 11. So the finger it was intended for didn't fit. So if you're interested watch out for that.
3,OK,"I bought this garlic for my dog to help with fleas. Thus far, compared to other brands, it hasn't been that effective. The pills are easy to swallow and tinted green (parsley)."
5,I was hooked from the opening pararaph.,"Gregor Demarkian, the retired FBI agent, is a man of reason, logic, intelligence and good will. Jane Haddam recognizes that life as it is lived reflects few of these qualities. The play in her works, which allow for her subtle ironic commentary, comes from the contrast of Gregor and the situations in which he finds himself. This time he is agrees to appear on an outrageous talk show--as favor to a friend--completely unaware of that he's agreed to appear center ring in America's favorite new circus.Hannukah, the season of light, that celebrates the survival of the oppressed, is the theme of this book. Haddam contrasts the cult of celebrity and the outrageous with the lives of those who work on the show, many of whom are among the poor and the marginalized. Well-done, thought-provoking and engagingly funny and ironic."
1,Festival of Deaths,I read this book out of desperation - nothing else was handy. I hope I'm never this desperate again. No suspense. No real plot. Weakly described motivation for the crimes. No real detective work. And a cast of unlikable characters who all act fairly irrationally. In real life Carmencita Boaz would have gotten out of the hospital bed and strangled Itzaak Blechman for his blabbering. By the end I was wishing that Gregor Demarkian has choked on his mamoul cookies.
1,I am amazed this book got published!,"This book is not only poorly written but badly edited. One of the major characters has been identified with different last names ""Jackson/Jackman"" within a two paragraph span. It is slow, repetitive and filled with dead ends, uninspired characters and trite cultural stereotypes. By the end it doesn't matter ""who done it"". They should have all perished in a holiday earthquake!"
5,Why Can't I Ever Be Good Enough? Escaping the Limits of Your Childhood Roles,I loved the book and am still reading it! It has been very helpful for me to heal the dysfunctional & erroneous beliefs about myself that I picked up during my childhood with my parents. I liked the part about finding contracts that I subconsciously made with life that were destructive to me.
1,Theadore is on his way back to Amazon,"I purchased this video for my child and found it absolutely awful. At least in Thomas the tank engine you get a little bit of a better story, for example, Theadore and his friends are too friendly to each other. At least in Thomas they at least the Frieght Cars torment the engines a bit. I recommend you do not buy this video."
4,this book needs more publicity!,"Marcelo turns what could be an endless soap opera into one of the most beautiful, delicate and funny books I've ever read.He proves to be a strong, sensitive individual and integrates part of the history of Brazil during the dictatorship while developing this beautiful autobiography.My only complaint is that I felt like I was left in the middle of something, the plot didn't offer enough of a closure.I wish more people in the States knew about this book."
5,Happy Old Year,"I read this book in June the 2003 and I thought the book is very nice, interesting and special. The book is An Autobiographyby Marcelo Rubens Paiva (THE AUTHOR), his problems, his happy moments and sad moments. I loved it and I recomend it because this is a motivating book. It's a drama and one true story."
1,"Boring, boring and boring...","The trouble with this book is that the writer is not, basically, a likeable person. He writes with foul language all around, and his life before the accident was one of drugs and alcohol all the time. Also, his literary style is almost non-existent, I think a monkey could write this mess. I really don't know how this book was the huge success it was in Brazil."
4,Great read!,This is a great read if you love nature and backpacking. It will make you want to grab you pack and head out to the Oregon Wilderness!
4,"Boo Cortez, yay Tyrone Power!!","A fine Tyrone Power action picture, with Power at his most George Clooney-esque as a Spanish outlaw who makes his way to the New World as a member of Hernando Cortez's invading army. Power proves his loyalty to Cortez and regains his social status, while getting revenge on the Robespierre-like bad-guy who chased him across the Atlantic. The uncritical glorification of the Conquistador's slaughter of the native people is troublesome, but the film itself moves at a pretty healthy clip, and is an enjoyable, if quite conventional adventure film, taken on its own terms."
3,Big Budget Spectacle - noise and fury signifies nada,"An elaborate and big budget film that remains unexciting and pointless in its attempts to show Cortez' conquering of Mexico with a ridiculous plot - our hero nearly ""dies"" twice. Those margaritas must have healing powers. Powers is unconvincing in lead, Peters miscast. It does boast stunning Technicolor cinematography and sumptuous costumes. The score by Alfred Newman earned an Oscar nom -the love theme is gorgeous but other than that it is pedestrian with a few conquering marches thrown in for good measure."
3,Seriously! The movie is a travesty compared to the book.,"I've read the book ""Captain from Castile"" by Samuel Shellabarger several times over the last 30 years. It is truly one of the most thrilling and captivating books ever written. I continue to need to take breathers during times when the story is just too intense to handle all at once. Yes.... it is written that well!When I found out there was a screen version, I was extremely excited. Awwww, how sad for me. The movie was a terrible disappointment. The soul of the book has been completely annihilated. However, as a ""Swashbuckler"" of it's era, it's good, and it is satisfying enough. But if you're looking for a true adventure, read the book. And after that, read it again. But I really don't need to tell you that. You will do it automatically."
3,Not Enough Real History,"The conquest of Mexico is one of the great adventure stories in history. This film trivializes it by focusing on the story of one Spanish nobleman (Tyrone Power) and by treating only the beginning of Cortes' campaign. Cesar Romero makes the film in the role of Cortes. He is energetic and magnetic. It's a great performance. The rest of the film pales in comparison. Some will resent the heroic treatment of the conquest, and those who do probably shouldn't see this movie."
3,The music is the star,"I bought this DVD for one reason: the beautiful musical score by Alfred Newman. It also has another asset: the gorgeous cinematography. I was entranced by the music when I saw it many years ago, and looked forward to the DVD. It was a long time coming, possibly because the story (about the looting of Montezuma's treasures by Cortez) was considered politically incorrect. For whatever reason, I'm glad it's finally available. The movie is pretty good in itself, and Jean Peters and Tyrone Power are pretty as well."
5,If you only one Insect Ecology book...,"This is the one to get, as most professors of entomology and insect ecology will attest!"
4,Pure and Varied Nostalgia,"If someone still has any doubt about Pontoni's talent here is the biggest demonstration of his diverse cleverness to jump between different musical styles without any fear.In Todo este tiempo, Pontoni shows his experience at his best, and proves to be one of the greatest Colombian ballad performers of all time.From the country remake of Dime que paso to the andean music of Aguila. From the colombian folk sound in Luna Roja to the powerful guitars in Por que ahora. Each one of the 23 tracks on the album is decorated with great strings and orchestral arrangements.This is pure and diverse nostalgia mixed with many surprises such as his unique voice and his wonderful skills as a composer.In only 11 words: ""A necessary piece of work for each serious latin ballad collector""."
3,"Good powder, but you need more than a spoon","As far as the ingredients go, it's a very good whey protein. When I first got it, I tried dissolving it in water or milk and mixing with just a spoon. It did not mix well at all, and the taste was vile (Vanilla flavor). That said if you put it in a blender with water/milk and fruit, for example, it tastes great and blends well."
5,Great protein source,I ordered the vanilla and it has a very good taste. I just started my second can and will order a third when this one is finished.
5,Good & Good for you!,"Two scoops with 3/4 C water is ample for good chocolatey flavor but I love to add one additional scoop for richer flavor plus that gives me 30g protein. I like that it is not sweetened with artificial sweeteners but with organic cane juice and stevia which are the healthiest. Excellent ""shake"" if you place protein powder, water and one frozen banana in a blender. (no ice needed if banana is frozen)"
4,Whey protein,"I like it.I got this product because Traders Joes was out of vanilla my usual whey protein.It is my favorite flavor and product because it has a lot of vitamins too.Biochem is sweet , has more protein and is good tasting.I mix with 2% milk.This does not dissolve easily when shaken.If you like vanilla whey protein.You will enjoy this."
1,gritty and doesn't disolve at all!,I didn't like this product at all!It has a gritty texture and I could not for the life of me get it to disolve completely.I even put it in hot boiling water first and then added it to my blender and it still didin't disolve completly.Hate it!
3,I don't feel any different,i bought this because i thought it gave me more muscle or recover after workouts. the product taste good but i haven't seen a change in my muscle. i don't think imma purchase anymore
4,Vanilla is too sweet and Natural is Just Right Vanilla,"I first purchased Biochem lo carb NATURAL flavor. I had to go to the ingredients when I purchased that one and saw that it had french vanilla flavoring. Exactly what I wanted and unsweetened. Awesome flavor and texture. Loved it and wanted to get a larger container to last longer, was using it everyday. So I purchased this 30 oz Biochem VANILLA Flavor Whey Protein powder. Same color of container. I did look at the ingredients again but overlooked that the VANILLA flavor is sweetened with stevia and it is really sweet. If you are looking for a sweet health shake then this is the one for you. I like no sweetener and if it needs sweetening I add that myself. I love that Biochem at least does have the variety to choose from so that I can get the unsweetened next time. But wish it were less confusing. If I had bought the lo carb natural flavor on this site I'd give it ten stars."
5,Love this powder!,"I have tried many different brands and Biochem is my all time favorite. Light, sweet but no to sweet and blends well with everything."
5,great,this product is tried and true and is exactly as ordered and does what it says it will do. Good
4,"Good product, solid ingredients","I have been using this for 6 months now, primarily in fruit and juice smoothies and it blends nicely. It does clump a little in warm liquid. I like that it has a mild flavor and doesn't add that sharp sweet note that many have."
5,Whey Protien is very good,I really liked this whey protien and will purchase it in the future. It adds a little sweetness to my smoothies. I usually put bananas in my morning smoothie to make it sweet but I don't need it with this protien mix.
5,Tasty protein powder,This one dissolves fairly easily and does not have a chalky taste. It also does not have a funny aftertaste like some powders do. It is great in fruit smoothies.
5,Love that vanilla flavor!,"I HATE the malt flavored protein mixes, and was very pleased to find this vanilla flavored mix. Not only does it taste fabulous (I mix mine with 1% milk), but it seems to be a great well-balanced mix at a great price as well. I've learned if you add the powder SLOWLY while stirring it mixes in smooth. If you just dump the mix into the milk (or pour the milk over the powder pile in a glass) it allows the clumps to form. I'm sure it would mix really great in a blender if you are making a smoothie (which this vanilla flavor would be great in a fruit smoothie). All in all I will continue to buy this mix and know I'm getting a quick breakfast on the run that actually helps keep me feeling full as it's packed with protein. Give it a try! You won't be disappointed."
3,Biochem protein,"This protein is very sweet. I would get something in the future with less sugar. Good flavor, but too sweet for me."
5,Perfect after workout snack,"I put this stuff in my healthy smoothies. Not only does it taste great compared to any other product I have tried, it fills me up. I also paid $40 for this at a local store! Excellent price online."
2,not crazy about it,"This seller shipped it very fast to me so that was positive.Honestly, I am just not a fan of flavored chocolate protein or any flavor for that matter. I now will only buy unflavored products and add real cocoa powder to give better taste. I know everyone else gave nice reviews but I will not buy this product or any like it again."
3,HELP ME OUT?,"I dont want to mix it with bannanas or fruit... I am LOW CARB trying to shed 70 pounds is there ONE just ONE person out there... who can give me the skinny on this product for LOSING weight... I am 270 use light weights... five days a week and want to drop excess FLAP like my gut,,, bring my weight down to 130 pounds,,, I need a WHEY PROTIEN that can deliver the amount of grams I need daily... without the 160 calories in every glass... and low in carbs that it won't interfere with my weight loss goal... why cant one American manufacturer create a product that works...?? I am told I need 2 grams of protien for every pound of weight. How can I get that in a product when I'd be taking in so much fat and calories I will GAIN..."
4,Love,"Love this protein, it taste really good, especially with a little Almond milk. I use it when i do weight training. Love it"
4,Vanilla is a bit sweet,"It's a great product (I've had this in Natural before and it was perfect), though the vanilla flavoring is a tad too sweet. That's really my only complaint, actually - some days the sweetness doesn't bother me at all, other days it's cloying. There's no chemical aftertaste and I still swear by Biochem because of this."
5,Our Favorite,"We have tried several protein powders and like the flavor, mixability, appetizing smell, and content of this product. It is slightly less sweet than Jay Robb's Vanilla Whey Protein. The absolute worst product in this category is the chalky MLO Super High Protein-yuk!Here's a recipe for our late night snack:Slumber Shake Serves 28 oz Silk Vanilla Soymilk2 scoops Ultimate Lo carb Protein Powder8 oz Gaymont yogurt (peach/cherry/strawberry/raspberry/blueberry)1 cup frozen fruit (matching above peach or berry flavor)Blend until smooth and sip it through a straw!This is consistent with the Zone diet balancing protein, carbs, and fat."
1,7 G of Cane Sugar,"If you are on a diet that avoids sugar you should be made aware this product has 7 G of ""Organic Evaporated Cane Sugar. I bought their ""Natural Flavor"" http://amzn.com/B0015QSU9Q and it has no sugar. It would be nice if Amazon would require all Ingredients be posted."
4,Shipped on time,Tastes o.k. and seems to provides the supplemental protein that I need. The price is good for whey protein powder and milk without added hormones is used.
4,So Close To Perfect.,This book is by a Pastor who really cares about the community in which he lives in. He learned this valued info and passed it on to his congregation so that they too would be Out of Debt and in to Praise. Not only did he share this info with his flock he also shared it with over thirty thousand other households in his community because of a vision that he has for his community. The book is great and has some very good info.
2,"Lots of preaching, not much practicality","For a book on how to get out of debt, this book offers very little on how to do that. Someone needs to go through this book and correct all the math errors ... don't rely on the figures. You'll love this book if you want lots of Scripture and preaching. But there are much better books if you want to get out of debt."
5,Cult films,"The acting is not the greatest, but considering the period the films were produced late 60's-early 70's the story line is important. The peace/hippy movement was going on at this time. Billy Jack the Green Beret, half Indian, the Peace activist school teacher who won't fight back until she is attacked. It's a good story for those who don't think that you have to, or don't want you to be able to protect yourself in these times."
2,Billy Jack collection,"Frist.Thank you to Amazon product's, For the ggggreat service and tracking site.However,there is a problem with one of the CD's.Which is not Amazon's fault. The CD (Billy Jack Goes to Washington).Will NOT play.The way it was printed.(Defaulted)Leaves a very bad taste in my mouth about any furture buy's of CD's.IMAGE Entertainment,won't step up to the plate. After I try to contact them for a possable replacement.So this has left me with the feeling,that I will not buy any-more CD's on line in the furture. I have better rights at a store, than I do on line.Sorry about that. But you have to understand. When you buy a product. And that product dose not work right. And no one steps up to the plate to make it right. You find other ways to protect yourself.Sign.Paul"
2,Compatability,"DVD plays fine in computer, but skips a lot and there are audio issues when played in my dvd player!!"
2,SOUND PROBLEMS,AUDIO WAS NOT GOOD.TURN VOLUME UP SO YOU CAN HEAR THE TALKING IN THE MOVIE AND THE BACK GROUND NOISE WAS TOO LOUD. CONSANTLY TURNING VOLUME UP AND DOWN
5,All 4 Billy Jack films at a great price from Image Entertainment!,"Now that the Ventura 35th Anniversary Ultimate Billy Jack Collection is now OOP, this 4-DVD set from Image Entertainment is now replacing that one! This has pretty much the same content(the menus are even the same execpt this one has the Image Entertainment logo in the beginning instead of Ventura's, it even says 35th Anniversary and everything!) as the 35th Ultimate set except for the bonus disc. Each film has 2 commentary tracks(one from 2000 and one from 2005), This set has 4 slim line cases in a nice collector's box! Recommended for the Billy Jack fan!!!"
3,Billy Jack,Billy Jack was one of the first tuff guy movies to come out in the late sixties and early seventies.It is dated so you might be alittle disappointed.The story was well written.
3,Great Movie,Great movie and I guess the copy was remastered? Some images were shaky but over all a good purchase for a classic!
5,billy jack series of movies,"My husband was thrilled with these movies, we have been looking for them. He just thinks these are the greatest movies ever made."
2,Noisy background ??,The first disc has a lot of background noise..was going to send them back...but the other discs were ok.....not worth it to send them back...
3,a time past,"The movies are sooooo dated..i liked at one time , but i grew up. The movies as just movies , i think are pretty good..and even the fight scenes, but nothing like todays action.I was a teenager when Billy came on the scene. Really ...i like the action , the sceneary and believe it or not , the acting.He tries so hard to send out a message , it hurts. But in all i think it would be fun for anybody to watch and get some ideas of how we thought back then. I like the first 3 movies but the 4th, well ....."
4,Nostalgic Memories,"This brings back memories of the '60's. It was fun to see the things that we had forgotten about or that had faded in our memories. There is one scen in the first movie, ""Born Loser's"" where Billy Jack walks over to this black box hanging on the wall and had a hand set attached by a cord. he put a coin in this machine and started to twist this rotary dial thing on the front. My Granddaughters marveled at this item (they had never seen a Pay Phone before), one girl remarked he should have just used his cell phone.The movies were well reproduced and the picture quality was as good or better than what was shown on Big Screen back in the 70's. Sound quality was well reprodeuced also. Unlike some remakes, this one came through very well on my home theater. But the ultimate comment is that this was a B movie when it was released and it is still a B movie today. however for nostalgia, it is worth the price."
2,Billy Jack Collection,"Saw the first two movies years ago but hadn't seen the second two. Enjoyed seeing the first two movies again and give them both a 3 star rating. However, the third movie was way too long, often dragged and was very preachy and the fourth was just plain bad. Also, the cd's were supposed to be new but they were poor quality and skipped numerous times in several of the movies."
3,Alittle let down,I read Belly Laughs and Loved it. its was funny fresh and out of the norm as far as pregnancy books go but Life Laughs fell short in a big way. It was kinda boring. had a few cute things but overall I wasnt nearly as impressed as I'd hoped to be. P.S I'm the wife of Daddy of Three lol
2,Please enter a title for your review,"i probably just shouldn't review this because i'm not the intended audience, but i am a fan of jenny mccarthy's sense of humour and my disappointment in this book stems from the fact that it just isn't written in her voice. it's like she took lessons in writing in the voice of a conservative advice columnist, and i find it hard to imagine that much of the advice in this book could have any practical application unless you're in a relationship where direct communication is simply not an option."
3,Not as good as the first two,"It had funny parts, but I loved Belly and Baby Laughs. The writing in this one just seemed more strained. The last paragraph of almost every chapter started with ""So..."" - like she didn't really know how to end each anecdote other than with some sort of snippy comment or silly advice. I had higher hopes."
3,Light Laughs,"Jenny promises to tell the truth, be it crude, raw, or dirty, about those moments that don't always work out the way planned. In ""Life Laughs"" the topics she covers include going from having only used a stove to light cigarettes to serving up food poisoning, the first poop at his place (and hoping it goes down), purposefully not showering to keep him away, keeping up with the neighbors and their gaudy lawn decorations, what to do when sex gets old, and his new girlfriend.""Life Laughs"" provides light laughs, and proves that women can talk dirty; however, I'd rather watch the Comedy Channel."
2,An Axe to Grind...,"The first two ""laughs"" books were entertaining. This one has next-to-nothing about kids. In the chapter about Jenny's ex, the author emphasizes that the divorce was amicable and the ex-couple is friendly. However, so many of the other chapters are filled with bitterness towards husband and men. It seems that Jenny really has an axe to grind, and I wonder how amicable that divorce really was."
1,What's Wrong With You People?,Who buys this garbage? Is it just me or are her zany facial expressions and T.M.I. about her family's personal life getting OLD?
2,Don't Waste Money,"Although I'm a huge fan of Jenny McCarthy's books, this one was disappointing. It seemed as though she had completely random thoughts that she threw into a new book. Nothing fits & I couldn't relate to anything in this book. Belly Laughs & Baby Laughs are great though."
2,Too many details,"Though I enjoyed her previous 2 books, I found this book to have way too many details than I wanted to know about Jenny McCarthy's life. Even though I am very open-minded and understand that this book was written for a fun reading (actually that is why I got it), some of the things that she wrote were too gross to read about. As I was saying when I was reading it: ""How can she look in her mother's eyes and later in her son's eyes after they'll finish this book"""
4,She makes me laugh,"Although Belly Laughs and Baby Laughs made me laugh much more frequently than Life Laughs; it goes without saying, so I will say it, that this book is hilarious.Jenny has a way of making the reader feel as if you are right there with her going through the motions of everyday life and well... laughing about it. I especially like the chapter on sharing chores with your husband. They really do expect you to do jumping jacks and to twirl your baton every time they do the dishes. This is so unfair since they don't even notice that you do it everyday. I for one, stopped doing the dishes until my husband got the hint, as well as a hint of stinky dishes in the air. Thanks Jenny.This thrid installment is a wonderful addition to what is Jenny McCarthy at her finest. I look forward to reading many more ""Laugh"" books in my lifetime. Keep it up Jenny!Andrea Morello-Allen"
5,Hillarious,"This is one of the most hillarious books I have read in years!! I reccommend this to anyone that is looking for a great, quick read!! Way to go Jenny!!!"
4,So what....,"Yes, some chapters are only a few pages long and some parts of it are crude but, WHO CARES? I'm a guy and I must say even I enjoyed reading it. Some of it is just downright FUNNY!(the episode in the red dress signing autographs...need I say more?) It was a quick read and gave a guy some good insights into certain things about a woman!"
3,"LIGHT, QUICK and ENTERTAINING....","Well, it is what it is. It's exactly what you would expect from Jeni McCarthy.Once I got used to all the bad language, I found it to be quite entertaining. She truthfully covered topics that all women have dealt with...And she's VERY, brutally honest and revealing when it comes to telling stories about herself.I'm sure there are people out there that find poop stories hilarious (I'm not one of them), but she did cover other topics that I could fully relate to. Luckily, she covers SO MANY different subjects, that everyone should be able to relate to at least some of it, and say 'Oh yeah...I've been there.'It's not meant to be serious, earth shaking material. It's more like a girls night out, in book form. I'd say, if you're not easily offended by bad language...and poop, go ahead and read it for fun."
3,Entertaining,"Another giggle fest, not as humorous as her belly laughs but I had a smile on my face while reading. Another book told from the humorous life of Jenny. Many pages I had to shake my head in agreement and just think how great is it to hear this true to life moments."
5,Love anything Jenny,Have read almost all of Jennys books and this one is a riot. tons of great laughs. Would recommend this book for an easy fun read
4,"Raw and real, that's Jenny (well yes, motherhood is like that too)","This is a very light read, so light I felt like I just drank some of Wonka's lemony fizzy-lifting drink. But, reading it is wicked fun! What is it about having a baby, that suddenly gives everyone and their brother the right to bombard you with unnecessary advice? What is it about motherhood that makes us feel oh-so-guilty 24/7? This book will certainly help mothers lighten up (and believe me, we all need it). Jenny tells it like it is, and she's quite frank as well as absolutely hysterical! I felt like I was overhearing a juicy conversation with her closest girlfriends - she just says things that no one has the guts to say - and I admire her for that. I hate to say it, but it's great to see a beautiful star so humbled by her inept attempts at parenting. Just make sure you have a sense of humor and an open mind before reading this one, and you'll enjoy it so much more."
3,Easy Read,Jenny McCarthy's Life Laughs is a humorous book filled with anecdotal stories about life from Jenny's point of view. The book was a very quick and easy read with some very funny moments. I'm sure that many people will be able to relate to the topics that Jenny discusses in the book and feel as though she is just one of your girlfriends sharing stories about her husband and/or baby with you.This is a book that would be good for someone who needs something light to read during a trip or while lounging on the beach.
4,Specifically a quick reference just to the Java API.,"The book's title is somewhat misleading. It's not an extensivereference to Java as a whole. If you're looking for that ina small book, you might want to see David Flanagan's book,Java in a Nutshell instead. However, where Java Quick Referencereally shines is in referencing the Java API. In contrastwith Flanaga, Afergan tells more about what each method ineach class actually does, and the values they return.All extensively indexed. Assuming you're generally familiar withthe Java APIs, this is a hand book to keep handywhile you're actually programming."
3,"A good album,oops, CD!","I rated this CD conservatively at 3 stars but I really like it more. I never heard of this band until I listened to them at my record store. The one song 'Growler in the Rumbleseat' strongly reminded me both vocally and musically of some older Moody Blues, which is how I compare this band. The songs are very melodical and they seem to know how to make these types of songs well. Bottom line: I liked every song, which is a rare thing these days. Their music is not repetitive, which means it won't wear you out. As songwriters and composers they change things up throughout as to make their songs interesting. I consider them a bit of a find. Give this one a shot, you might like them too."
4,cant believe that this is on dvd!,"My prayers have been answered; Heathcliff one of my favorite show's as a child of the 80's is on dvd for me to share with a new generation. Buy this, and send a message that people want Heathcliff!"
2,Disappointing reunion from the legendary teen-idol band,"After disbanding with the release of ""Siempre,"" ""X-Magneto"" marks the first recordings of the now-reformed teen-idol group. It features the band's classic lineup: Alan, Alex, Mauri, Elias and Charly. But most of this disc consists of the original recordings of the group's greatest hits, which already are available on other CDs. And of the two new songs, one is a remake of ""Vuela Vuela,"" which is hardly imaginative or original. And lead singer Alan's voice doesn't sound anywhere as strong or potent as it used to -- perhaps part of that has to do with the fact that he's seen smoking in the booklet, so maybe taking care of his voice is not a priority for him. This could have been really special; instead, it's a disappointment."
3,Maybe the worst of this guys...,"Good music, but really boring. Intresting CD but really repetitive.Try it only if you're a fan...if not, try the oldies."
1,Almost Perfect,"this is undoubtedly a very, very good effort by Opeth. melodic,interesting, powerful, tortured are adjectives that come to mind. that this can all be accomplished using a ""soft-non-loud"" approach is a credit to them. the guitar and drum work is outstanding. from start to finish it's consistently excellent. i actually would rate this 4 3/4 stars (not 5) because i although the vocals are lovely, i would have enjoyed a little less smoothness. i'm sure their intention was to NOT introduce any rough/screaming vocals on this album. it's just that lately i've discovered BURZUM and man, that guy expresses pain! but, anyway, any fan of pink floyd/david gilmour, tool, or any mature death metal fan with an introspective side will love this. as a matter of fact, i can't think of too many people who wouldn't find something to enjoy in this."
