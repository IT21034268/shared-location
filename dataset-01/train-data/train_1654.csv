2,redrex,"It wasn't as good as I thought it would be. Slow start, the end seems as though there was supposed to be a sequel with Michael Caine."
5,The Italian Job,Another gret Michael Caine DVD purhased from Amazon. I missed the chance to purchase it when the movie first appeared. It is a great DVD.
3,Italian Job - Original,It was interesting. The remake is definitely more exciting. It is different than the remake and the ending keeps you hanging.
3,A little short on plot but high on adrenline.,A must see for Noel Coward's prison queen and some terrific car stunts. That's about it. But hey...it's fun and relatively cheap.
4,"Great movie, despite the ending","This movie was great. It is different then the remake, storywise. The one thing I didn't like about this movie was the ending-it wasn't resolved and I don't enjoy movies that end that way. If you can handle an unresolved ending, then the rest of the movie is well worth seeing...it really holds your attention."
1,The remake was better if only for the ending for which the writers of the original didnt seem to know what to do with it.,"While the original, interesting only because it was the original, actually did not have the whimsy the Marky W. remake had and the ending of the original was stupid, and attempt at irony that failed badly and a real downer. Michael Caine, great, magnificent gentleman actor that you have always been, why did you do this movie."
3,"Love the movie, Hate the DVD","This is one of my favorite movies from my childhood, which I saw once on television in Italy and never could find it again. I looked forward to finally owning a copy and ordered it months before it was available. When I received my DVD I was very disappointed. The color fades in and out for most of the movie, not a little, but drastically. The sound is a little off, but not that bad. I don't know if it is just my copy, or all copies, but if you order this great movie, make sure you save the return information in case it is a faulty. I didn't."
5,The original Italian Job,"This was an excellent, movie, great combination of actors, especially with Micheal Caine, Noel Coward and Benny HIll.Extremely funny done to the end. If you have not seen the original Italian Job, you are missing a great classic."
2,One of those times when the re-make a lot better.,Sorry folks the original Italian Job was really sssslllloooowwww and boring.For once the re-make starring Donald Sutherland was heaps better.
5,A perfect picture,"This movie is utterly of its time. Rather than rattle us, scare us, thrill us, it charms us, just about effortlessly, through a perfect combination of cast, script, music, and direction. Caine is terrific as heist head man Charlie Kroeger, but the greatest pleasure comes from Coward, playing a behind-bars king of Anglo-Saxon crime with a fixation on The Queen. In a small part, Benny Hill is a delight. The chase scenes are filmed not from the cars' bumpers, but from a graceful distance, and Jones's music is a deliciously light accompaniment to the playful Mini Cooper sequences that benefit as much from Turin's scenery as from unexpected twists and turns--across a weir, swinging through a sewer pipe.From beginning to end this is a gem, breezy, light, devoid of any real grit or seriousness."
1,you've got to be kidding...,"I had heard the original version of ""The Italian Job"" was a great movie. I liked the new version that came out a few years ago and thought maybe the original would also be good. Unfortunately this has to qualify as one of the all time worst most boring stupid movies of all time. I can't imagine how the creators of the new one even considered a remake. It's good that there is virtually no similarity between this and the newer movie. It's just plain boring! I don't think this disc will be taking up space in my DVD shelves, it just ends up in the trash!"
2,Terrible! Get the remake with Mark Wahlberg,"I LUV the remake of this flick, and decided to get the original. After all, most of the time, I like the original more than the remake. Boy, was I wrong. This movie was TERRIBLE! The acting was fine, but it's totally dated in script and actions of characters. And it was a slow mover. Want to see it? Get the remake with Mark Wahlberg."
2,What?!?,Maybe I just don't get it but this movie was choppy and difficult to follow. And the ending was quite a let-down. The remake (2003-4?) was much much better.Get the original Ocean's 11 (with the Rat Pack) instead!
1,Waste of time,"In the late 60's, this movie might have been reviewed as a ""whimsical farce"" or some other such nonsense. I saw it last night. It was a waste of time. Michael Caine is supported by a large group of poorly trained actors in a movie that looks like some kid directed it while his dad was out to lunch. The almost nonexistent score consists of a few random notes and a very boring refrain near the end of the movie. I have great respect for Caine as an actor and I've enjoyed his work in many films since, but this must have been one he had to do to pay the rent.This is certainly one time where the remake is much better than the original."
5,A British Classic Movie,"A British classic movie.Great actors,Great cars,Great Places.These Minis were integral part of the movie, they were the stars !!!This movie is a must in every dvd library.Michael Caine is a class A actor.Hopefully if they are going to make an Italian Job #2 they should include Michael Caine in the cast it would be such a treat !!!"
5,The Italian Job - Michael Caine,"A wonderful action movie set during 1969 Italy and England. This movie is actually better than the remake. When I first heard that someone had finished making the remake, I tried to find a copy of the original. I remembered seeing it on TV years ago and that it was a great show. The music in the original is super and true to the era. What makes this movie great is the Minis ofcourse, but also Michael Caine. I bought the original. Too bad they never made the sequel that had orginally been planned."
2,"Film to video transfer, tape dupe produced poor picture qual",Content of the movie is great but transfer of film to video and subsequent tape duplication produced deplorable picture quality. Is this movie going to be released on DVD? If so wait for the DVD version.
2,Disappointing & blundering,"I absolutely loved the remake -- partly because I'm very fond of those very sexy Minis -- so I was looking forward to watching the original, but this one's a bust. The movie drags, the superb actor Michael Caine comes across as oafish, the comedy comes across as inexplicable, and even the car chase scenes leave you wanting. In short, this one's worth skipping. Watch the new one if you've any interest in good car chases, reasonably interesting dialogue, or even a plot that makes sense."
2,Look Further,"Taste: 1 Star = Extremely hard (like shredded paper) and very little flavor. Not ""HOT"" at all.Gave 2 Star rating only because it was conveniently packaged in 1/2 oz. size which is what I was seeking.Shelton's Turkey Jerky, Hot, 0.5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24)"
1,Maybe it's time for Katt to retire?,"Very disappointed! This one may be good for those that know nothing about Katt Williams. Not sure if Katt had anything to do with this one but I will say, THIS WAS NOT EXPECTED. The selling point should not be ""never-before-seen stand-up from Katt's early career"", this gives the illusion that there is going to be some comedy involved (whether we've seen it or not). There was little to no comedy on this dvd; a lot of talk about Katt's life. We've see enough of that on television so spare me. Whoever thought this was a good idea, be more creative and come up with another hustle."
1,Garbage Documentary,"This is garbage. There's no comedy in it, and I bet Katt was not even involved. You will be totally disappointed. You've been warned!"
2,Wack,This product which I thought was going to be a new stand up was just a documentary simliar to pimpadelic. I mean it nice and all but for this should have only been like 7 .99 price. People want to hear jokes not know about his come up
2,Not what I expected,I didn't realize the video wasn't as good as I thought it would be. I wish someone would have warned me against this purchase!
5,Good routine!,"Katt Williams: 9 LivesIt was good. Could have been better. I thought it was more of a stand-up routine, not a documentary!"
4,I'm All In,Caught a short clip online earlier this week and it definitely got a chuckle out of me. I can't wait for the official release because this is the Katt Williams I'm very used to seeing.
5,Finally!,Finally some new Katt Williams in my life! I hope this is the tip of the iceberg as far as releases are concernced because I seriously miss Katt. His brand of comedy increasingly grew on me the more specials I watched. I honestly can't wait for this release and hope Katt decides to come back cause the game desperatly needs him!
3,9 months later.... have problems viewing channels... sigh.,sony can only give me another refurbished TV. I was disappointed. I was going to get another Sony LCD TV at smaller size since Sony is such a trusted brand. now switching to Samsung. Hope theirs is better.
4,terrible smell of burnt wires and glue,"got a steal with 1299 including shipping directly from AMZNafter setting up the TV started with biting burned wire smell, so after 3 days i called Sony to report it, Sony gave me a number from a local service center, called and had a next day appointment, the service guy run the diagnostic, and explained me he had the same problem with some other brandssuggested to run it for 2 weeks and seesmell gets less every day, or my nose gets used to it?service guy told me the TV will shut down in case of overheating etcthe service guy fine tuned some of my set me up of the sound and the picturefirst time LCD HD user, awe full picture, looking forward to see the EURO soccer championship in June and later the Olympics"
5,Sony 40V3000 is a Great TV...,"Great TV...Just purchased the PS3 and the picture is awesome. The only thing I regret is not buying the 46 or 52 inch Sony TV's. The price was to good on the 40"" to turn down."
3,Bad Blacks !!!,I have to say that i knew beforehand that LCD screens have some problems managing the black levels but not more than i know now that i have this Sony model.. When i'm watching a dark movie like Underworld Evolution this tv has issues. The image turns blurry and while panning a scene the failure becomes notorious. I'm talking about while playing a Blue ray disc. while watching the super bowl on SD signal every time Fox showed Peyton Manning watching the game i could not even recognize him well because the image was very dim and blurry...I like terror movies and think i will have troubles watching them in this set. The clear scenes are beautiful and detailed in Blue ray.I don't know if my configuration is not settled for a good black managing but i've tried many and none of them seem to work for me yet..Any advise?
2,Tv Burned out,"We bought our Bravia 4 years ago and the LCD panel has failed. the TV cost $2000 and now it doens't work. The part costs $1600 to replace. What a bummer to have a $2000 TV fail after 4 years. I tried calling Sony to see if there is anything the would do. They basically said sorry, its been happening a lot to that model of TV and we aren't fixing or replacing them. I don't know if I will ever buy Sony again after this. I am disappointed in their customer service and product quality. I use to think Sony was one of the best, no I doubt that."
5,"sony bravia kdl-40v3000 40"" 1080p lcd hdtv","Great product,great service,fast shipping.No problems what so ever. TV easy to set up. excellent picture."
5,great TV,TV looks and works awesome. Don't get confused with audio visual experts. This TV is great for the money
2,Sony KDL-40V3000,Purchased Sony KDL-40V3000 last month from Best Buy. Got it home and the controls on the top of the set would not work. Sony advised to return it. I did for another set. Controls work fine however it seems as though the remote has to be pointed almost directly at the sensor on the set to operate. Now Sony says its a warranty issue. This has not been a good experience. Anyone else had these problems?
4,A happy customer,Bought the Sony LCD TV after reading other reviews! Have been a Sony Customer for the past 10 years.Love the TV and very intuitive controls.Love the picture!!Would highly recommend it.
3,Do not buy!,"Bought this TV in January 2008 and a year and a half later black shadows appeared down the screen. Clearly a fault in the LCD panel. Check out Sony.co.uk discussions forums, there are quite a few folk on there with the same problem and Sony have told me that they are unaware of any problems of this kind with this TV, - maybe they should take a look at their own forum pages. There are many people there with the same problem who have all contacted Sony so I find it incredible that they deny any knowledge of the problem. I would say that this is a good looking TV and I thought that the Sony brand was reliable and trustworthy..not now, totally disgusted with Sony's attitude! Will not buy another Sony product!"
4,very pleased new owner,"I have had this tv for about a month and a half now. Delivery through Amazon was flawless. I immediately upgraded to a time-warner HD cable box. After resetting the picture options to much more realistic and pleasing colors, brightness, and contrast I must say that I am thoroughly delighted with the performance of this set. HD channels are amazing, SD channels are quite good. Wish Time-Warner had more HD channels. I am using HDMI from the cable box without any problems and component cables from a standard DVD player. The DVD picture is a little better than SD but I am definitely considering an upgrade to a Blu-ray player as soon as the prices drop a little. At $1299 with free delivery I feel this TV is an excellent value. I understand SONY has just released their new models, which probably accounts for the discount on this one."
4,Bravia KDL400V3000,"After several weeks of research on my first LCD HDTV, I decided to go with the sony brand based on user reviews. My only problem was that I needed to narrow it down because there are so many different models. I knew that 1080p was the way to go, so that helped a little, but by comparing the different sony models side by side at a local store, I found that this model was the second best in the lineup. Just a notch below the XBR this television gives a great quality picture and tons of features. I especially like the customization and setup options available on the sony model I purchased. It allows you to really set the unit up how you want it. The only minor complaint I have is that in 480i mode, when the tv is turned on, it will default to 4:3 instead of 16:9 like I have specified in the setup. A quick change to an HD signal and back fixes it, so it is only a minor annoyance. Otherwise it has worked flawlessly for me in the month that I have owned it."
2,Service request is a nightmare!,"Product is fine except there are two horizonal lines on the screen (missing Pixels). It has been well over a month since I made a request for repair from a Sony authorized repair organization. My opinion: if you buy a Sony product, keep your fingers crossed that it does not need service."
5,Get this TV!!,"Have had it for 1 week. We are more than impressed with the picture on this! It is our first flat panel hd tv. It was extremely easy to setup with our existing home theater and dvd player. Don't forget to buy an hdmi cable to attach from your tv to cable/sat box. I also got one of those from Amazon for $2! Don't pay outrageously for those things, most places are charging $40-100 for them.Just watched Shooter in HD on this tv, and I'm telling you, it's like we were THERE! Some of the scenes were almost 3D-like. We were blown away!Regular satellite channels look much better than most lcd televisions we looked at. Some of the channels almost looked like HD too, even though we don't subscribe to them. Buy this television you will not regret it."
5,Fantastic One,"Sony Bravia KDL-40V3000 40"" 1080p LCD HDTVMy first HDTV, this was at the top of my list almost bought a Sharp 42"" 64U. The price of this SONY 40V3000 was even better than Sharp and has better specs. With the quality name like SONY I know it's dependable. Bought it from Amazon on Sunday and received on Friday with free shipping, very satisfy overall. Connection and setup were easy. When the picture showed up it was breath taking. I should of gotten this a long time ago. Just love it, love it."
5,Sony - YES! Eagle Delivery Service - NO!!!,"The TV? It is absolutely fabulous! We now have two Sony LCD TVs and I wouldn't dream of buying anything else. Also, between the time we purchased the TV and the time it was delivered the price went down, and Amazon very happily credited me the difference. I was so taken with all the reviews that said Eagle would bring in the TV and plug it in to be sure it worked! NOT! In fact, the driver of the truck was so scared of the public road to our house that my husband had to go meet them and ask them to come with him to be sure it worked. The driver said there was no way they do that - even tho the dispatcher who had scheduled the delivery said that they would. Never again would I buy anything that used Eagle."
1,No reasonable explanations,"The book has a lot of TEST questions, but there are no reasonable explanations for some of the answers.There are a few incorrect answers, but otherwise you will have to fend for yourself."
5,Loved It!,"This really gives you a great understanding of the history and life of the Florida Cracker. I never knew ""cowboys"" existed anywhere outside of the ""Old West"" until seeing this documentary. This picturesque view of the life of Florida Cattlemen is facinating, and keeps you entertained from beginning to end. If you love horses, you love history and learning about people then this is definitely for you!"
5,Good Movie,I really like the movie but after going to white castle for the first time I wouldn't waste that much time trying to go there.
1,Great Reading If You Suffer From Insomnia,"Reading this drivel along with Pierre Salinger's Valentine from the Heart to the misunderstood tyrant - I could not help but thinking of Mel Brook's movie ""The Producers"" with its climatic play ""Spring Time For Hitler"". If there ever was a more lunatic writer and dictator then Qaddafi (how do you spell the nut jobs name - Qaddafi, Gadafi, Khadafy?)I would like to know about it. If there ever was a more idiotic ""journalist"" then Salinger - please let me know. Shame on the publisher!"
4,Interesting naration,"An interesting naration of a part of Maryland and Virginia's history few people know about. The book comes across as a little sensationalist when read. However, given the topic, and many of the turn of the century newspaper sources, this would be hard for any author to avoid. (I had the same thoughts when reading Michener's fictional accounts in ""Chesapeake"", yet these events really did happen.) If you are interested in the culture and history of the Chesapeake this is quite an enjoyable read that will add context to other readings."
4,The Oyster Wars of Chesapeake Bay,Really interesting all the violence and especially the slavery that went on up until the early 1900's. I never realized oystering was such a money making trade.
5,"Touching, funny, and delicious","Whether you read her books or see her in person, you will come away from your time with Esme reminded that the everyday world is a wondrous place. I devoured this one snowy Saturday and cannot wait for my ten-year-old son to read it, too. (We plan to download the the audio version of Tuna Fish to our new IPod Shuffle! Esme reads the audio version herself, and she is a great performer.)"
4,Love everything she writes,"This is a memoir, but a memoir written for children, written to encourage children to write their own memoirs. I love everything Codell has written. I was happy to finally find a copy of this book. I suspected Codel had had an unconventional childhood; this book confirmed it, with artist parents, a stint at an alternative school, and adventures with a matzoh ball."
3,weird clues,"Acrostics are my favorite category of word puzzle, and I am starting to feel worried that new acrostics books will be even fewer and farther between than they are now. If that were not the case, I probably would skip these acrostics from Thomas Middleton. If you haven't memorized Shakespeare (including the sonnets) and are not familiar with other European literature from before the 19th century. you may find yourself turning to the solutions page or looking stuff up on the Internet more than you would like. It's embarrassing to admit, but that is definitely my experience. I also find that many of Middleton's clues refer to usages that are at best obscure -- i.e., clues and solutions I would never link up even when I know what the answer is. Takes some of the fun out of working acrostics."
3,Small Type Size Tough for Over 50,"This is my second Super Crostics Book and they are always challenging. Either my eyes have gotten much worse or the type is much smaller in this edition. You'll need several reference books handy. My favorites are The Million Word Crossword Dictionary, The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations and the Bible."
2,Binding,"Haven't used it yet but was disappointed that I didn't pick up in the description that it wasn't spiral bound. Lots of puzzles but working with it will be annoying. Not sure, but I thought the paper stock was not as heavy as spiral bound crostics. I have a feeling I'll have to forego half the puzzles because of that.My bad!!!"
4,"A strong, sharp precis","This is a great little book. I don't want to get involved in any debate about how closely it aligns with Castaneda, but it seems an excellent framework. As someone mentioned earlier, there are very few cogent manifestos for creating a life of intention. Clearly expressed, straightforward, simple."
4,Happy but a little disappointed,"I was looking for one of those city rugs for my son and when I saw that there was one based on his FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME (he's 3 1/2), I figured, Bonus! The thing is, I thought there would be the Willy's Butte race track, and more street to drive on. So I'm a bit disappointed in that regard. However, he plays with it a little and it's still cute, so overall I'm glad I bought it. I may still look for a city rug though."
2,"Decent Rug, not worth $49",We found this rug for $19 at a major chain store. I would not have paid over $20 for it. It did get played with quite a bit until we found some more complex city rugs that he (3 year old) likes more. It is very lightweight and doesn't stay down on carpet very well with two boys playing on it.
3,Superfly books,The book was okay. Spine broken but otherwise usable. No markings in book. Mailed USPS arrived on time. I'd use them again.
4,Nice little stories.,"""The Gift of the Magi and Other Stories"" has a nice variety of stories. I have the 1997 edition, which includes the stories ""The Gift of the Magi,"" ""The Last Leaf,"" ""Springtime a la Carte,"" ""The Purple Dress,"" ""One Thousand Dollars,"" ""Transients in Arcadia,"" ""A Chaparral Prince,"" ""The Clarion Call,"" ""The Hiding of Black Bill,"" and ""A Retrieved Reformation."" ""The Gift of the Magi"" is the best of them all, with ""The Last Leaf,"" ""A Chaparral Prince,"" and ""A Retrieved Reformation"" all coming in second place. O. Henry is an excellent short story writer - it's amazing how we can fully engulf ourselves within these stories, which are no more than ten pages long! I recommend."
4,Torroba-Luisa Fernanda,"Sets and costumes are a little less than lavish, however they are the same as used in the LA Opera stage production"
3,Falta sonido envolvente,"Excelente puesta en escena, eso si extraña maqueta aparece en primer plano, no entiendo porqué siendo una grabación reciente sólo se limiten a sonido estéreo y no emplearon sonido envolvente.Excellent presentation, that if strange model appears in the foreground, not understand why being a recent recording only be limited to stereo sound and not employed surround sound."
3,boards and string,"This is basically a bunch of cedar planks connected by fairly ordinary string. The cedar planks do have a pleasant aroma. It might be nice if they could be sanded to have smoother corners as they are currently slightly sharp and could possible cause injury if one fell on them while running, but I'm sure they'll wear down pretty quickly."
4,Full review to follow,"Using 20x60 Pentax Zoom Eyepiece.Seems to be a very nice unit. The attachment of the eyepiece makes me wonder about water intrusion. If moisture gets between the main body optics and the eyepiece, would it not effect the vision. I am sure the main body and eyepiece are both individually waterproof. It is the interface I am concerned about. With a one piece scope this is not a concern. One must decide between ruggedness and visual presentation. Minus 1/2 of a star.The glass is extremely bright. I am going to wait until dusk for another test. As I am in the high desert of California, midday, in the middle of summer, it would not be a fair test of imaging.The eye relief is not what I thought it would be. I must remove my glasses to get a lens full view at any magnification. The size of the view is outstanding once I remove my glasses. With my glasses on, only about a 1/3 of the image is visible.:( Minus 1/2 of a star."
1,"Gutman's doesn't land ""Tuna""-- a major disappointment!","The same for the paperback edition of ""Parcells""...This book, by and large, is nothing more then a rehash of old football games coached by Parcells. Gutman should be ashamed of himself for delivering yesterday's cup of coffee to football fans. Giving ad nasuem blow-by-blow accounts of games that took place 5-10 years ago is not my idea of a biography. About 25% represents Parcels' philosophies on life, football, family, and friends, etc., and I would rate that at best a C-. Overall the book is a major flop. Don't waste your money on this one. Of course, I shouldn't complain, I picked it up for a buck at a used bookstore...I paid 99 cents too much!"
1,Gutman Rip Off,"This book, by and large, is nothing more then a rehash of old football games coached by Parcells. Gutman should be ashamed of himself for delivering yesterday's cup of coffee--especially so to knowledgeable football fans. Giving ad nauseam blow-by-blow accounts of games that took place 5-10 years ago is not my idea of biography. About 25% represents Parcels' philosophies on life, football, family, and friends, etc., and I would rate that at best a C-. Overall the book is a major flop. Don't waste your money on this one. Of course, I shouldn't complain, I picked it up for a buck at a used bookstore...I paid 99 cents too much!"
2,"Good night baby, Mommie is so sorry","AWFUL. Yoko Ono sounds like an angel compared to this pure cr*p. I have discharged the fool that bought this for my princess, and monthes of therapy later she still has nightmares."
4,It's about time someone takes advantage of 5.1,"Excellent value. For $20, you get a copy of the original album on CD, several videos, and a great expanded 5.1 mix of the album. the only downside is that the end of the last track, approaching pavonis mons by balloon, drops out about 20 seconds before it should... this is a major disappointment, but maybe it shows why this project has been delayed so much already. that aside, it's well worth the money. maybe warner brothers will recall the faulty dvds."
4,"Excellent, but not the best","Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots is a great album, and yes, the 5.1 surround sound is quite something. If you've never heard DVD-Audio or SACD before this will totally blow you away. The sound is incredible and it's quite an experience to hear guitars, voices, and drums coming from different corners of the rooms or moving in circles. However, if you want to hear what surround sound music CAN sound like at its best, check out the Super Audio CD of Pink Floyd's Dark Side Of The Moon. Yoshimi's audio channels are too clearly defined, when a sound switches from one speaker to another you can hear the switch instantly, taking away from the ""circling"" effect. DSOTM mastered this effect by gradually shifting sounds from one speaker to the next. Regardless, this is totally worth buying even if you already own the CD, it's awesome to hear music you know and love as if you'd never heard it before."
5,Great use of surround format,"I have purchased or at least listened to, many higher resolution multichannel mixes of albums which I already had. I alway walked away thinking I wasted my money on something that was no better than the original I already owned. This album is a wonderful exception to the rule. It is far better than the already good original CD version. There is so much good extra stuff on this, I would have paid twice the price and still not feel cheated. The use of the surround channels and the movement of the sound around you as you listen, takes the listening experience of this disc to a new level. If every high resolution DVD-A or SACD was this good, everyone would be upgrading their players to these formats. If you every want a Audio surround disc to amaze your friends, look no further."
4,5.1 mix is a bit gimmicky...but still worth it,"I love the album. And the 5.1 mix is enjoyable. But it strikes me as a bit gimmicky. Sure, it shows off sound coming from every direction, but it doesn't sound natural enough to me. If you read the liner notes that come with the album, for example, you'll see that on one track, they simply move the sound around the room in a clockwise direction. On another the bass moves around on every single note. It's almost like they had some presets they could program in rather than really looking at the music and thinking about what would sound best. Rather it sounds like they're ""playing"". Not that it's a bad mix. The Lips have a quirky sound, so a slightly quirky mix is not all bad. If something like a Led Zeppelin album were mixed like this, it would be awful. Since it's the Lips, it works okay.But simply moving the audio around the room quickly or on every note does *not* make an ""awesome"" mix."
5,Oh Yoshimi,"Just Awesome. After having to re-buy this album for the third time, I chose this version with bonus tracks and a DVD that you can just pop in, play and enjoy the psychedelic colors and patterns. I love it! Great seller, I will use them again."
3,Notice no results yet,"Recommended to me by a health specialist at Whole Foods. She said there is a huge difference between activated and not-activated beauty products. She said MyChelle is activated and recommended (above all others) this and the Serum from this company. It feels good going on, but do not notice a difference yet and it has been months ... Disappointed. I will talk with her again."
3,Good case-study book,"Peter Cappelli provides a case-study analysis of airline labor in this book. The material is historically relevant and is a good snapshot of labor from multiple perspectives. Unfortunately, the book is not a stand-alone. Readers unfamiliar with airline labor will need a primer before reading this book. The book also does not account for the recent sweeping changes in the airline industry. Despite its shortcomings, this work is a good compliment for collegiate studies in human resources, aviation, and labor unions."
2,"Is it a story book, a picture book, or a serious study?","Even if it's difficult to catergorize, at a steep enough discount, this book can be nice addition to a wide range of libraries. While likable, this book is also somewhat disappointing. The author's talents as a local naturalist make Wild Heart of Los Angeles a good primer on the Santa Monica Mountains, and it's written with plenty of genuine enthusiasm, but the subject matter comes off as too large a scope for less than 200 pages. Perhaps a more professional overall approach to references and citations would have been helpful to readers. Overall, the author's goal to ""encourage people to love the Santa Monica Mountains"" seems to have been attained."
4,It works,"After a year or two the Korky valve starts to pulse when it shuts off. Cleaning the diaphragm buys a little time, but the only cure is to replace the diaphragm. This completely fixes the problem and is far easier than replacing the whole valve. This was an economical place to purchase it since they didn't overcharge for postage. To save further, I purchased two diaphragms at once."
1,Leaks worse than...,"Leaks worse than the 10 year old part it was supposed to replace. Buying original part direct from TOTO, this one to trash."
3,"It disappointed me, but it's still Backstreet...","It made me dizzy, the camera moves a lot, there's that girl with the accent talking over it, there's interviews with people that I didn't even know... but it's still Backstreet. I would recommend either ""Backstreet Boys Homecoming"" or ""A night out w/the BSB""... now, those are GREAT videos!!"
1,not a MUST have,"Some refer to the video as a 'must have for every fan', but thats not the case. Its nice to be able to say you have it, but the only worthwhile parts are the rare beginning footage of the boys. Its fun seeing them in the younger years, but if I had seen it before I bought it- I wouldnt give it a second glance."
1,I wouldn't recomend it,"I got this video just because i am a huge fan, but i really wish that i haden't. It was a total dissapointment. I mean there were people in the video that i had never heard of. The only good part in the video is for about 10 min, they show the boys when they were really young. It was like a homevideo thing. It is not a must have, but like me if you are a big fan you pobably will get it regardless of what people tell you."
1,"If you get only ONE BSB video, don't get this one","This video was not bad as much as it was stuff that most fans already know. There was footage from some interviews that haven't been seen in the U.S. but the narration was rather annoying with a thick accent and details any fan already knows. I would recommend that anyone who is getting a Backstreet Boys video consider ""A Night out with the Backstreet Boys"", ""Live in Orlando"", or ""Live in concert"" if you want live performance and ""All Access"" or ""Backstreet Boys the Video"". This video is unauthorized and the authorized videos have better footage and more interesting comentary because they assume you are a fan if you buy it."
2,"Ok, not the best, but worth watching.","well, its not that good. its worth watching because of the behind the scenes of when they started out, nick looks so little. All of them do. but its pretty bad footage and its the same thing over and over. I would not personally recomend it but it does have some perks. It would be worth like renting and watching if it were available but not to own and watch over and over. Get the Live In Concert Video if you want a good one to watch, or even The Video, not this."
1,Save your money,"I bought this video and was very sorry that I did. I love the Backstreet Boys & was glad to see that they were not shown in a bad light, but the video does not give the whole story. It gives half-truths & a lot of innuendo. The only nice thing about the movie is the old home movies. It was strange seeing the ""Boys"" when they were so much younger than they are now.Too bad that I could not have given the movie ""0"" stars."
5,The Other Side of The Coin,"The writer did an extraordinary job of presenting the story of the subjects involved and steering away from sharing her own opinions for the most part. It let the reader have the freedom of forming his or her own opinions about the people and situations involved.Having grown up in the Washington Heights section of NYC around the same time, i could relate although alot of the experiences were new and shocking to me.I think its a must read for anyone who thinks they have their minds made up on welfare reform and punishment of drug offenders."
5,Great Read!,This book was on the NEWSWEEK list of 100 books you should read and I hadn't. SOOOOOOOOOOO... it is really a good summer reading book!
4,"OH, PLEASE PREGNANT AND STUPID","This is such a comical book. It's about poor choices made over and over again but a bunch of easy/sleazy PR girls. Jessica and Coco are young Puerto Rican girls that get pregnant just about every year with different guys. Nobody can figure out where poverty and pregnancy comes from. It's sad that these girls have innocent babies that they can't feed or clothe and they go from homeless shelters into drug/roach infested apartments. By the descriptions of these girls Coco has a red face she picks at and she is four foot eleven, fat, small feet...I have to wonder who in their right mind are impregnating these idiots. It makes me happy that I am on the West Coast. Actually, all these children should just be rounded up and sent to an orphanage or foster care....they'd be better off."
2,A book to confirm your prejudice (whatever it happens to be),"If you are inclined to believe that the welfare system denies poor women adequate resources to take care of themselves and their children, and the criminal justice system perpetuates the plight of poor men of color, this book will confirm that view.If you are included to believe that the women on welfare are lazy, stupid, immoral, and neglectful of their children, and that poor men of color end up in jail because they're lazy, stupid, and immoral, too, and that they neglect their children and abuse their women as a matter of course, than this book will confirm that view, too.If the authors could have found case studies with more nuance, more gray, that might really have made this book useful -- there is a lot of critical public policy being made these days around issues of poverty, crime, and inner-city education, and a book like this in approach, with different subjects, might have been able to influence a lot of decisionmakers."
1,don't bother,"This book sounded so interesting I couldn't wait to read it. what a disappointment! The writing was awful. There was almost no dialogue. No character development at all. It reads like ""first so and so has a baby. Then she leaves it with this person. Than this other person has a kid too. than they both go out and party."" absolutely terrible. There are so many characters you can't keep them straight. Since you don't really know anything about any of them you really don't care what happens. I hate to leave a book unfinished but I'm not sure if I can finish this one."
2,redundant,"this book should have been about 30 pages long. its the same story over and over and over. girls pregnant at 14 by losers who are shortly off to jail. girls have more babies by different losers who go off to jail. girl gets tattoo. girl visits loser in prison. girl has another baby. yadda yadda yadda. it is sickening to me that the mothers of these girls can't help them to see a better way. given their mothers' experience of how having too many babies keeps you down, you'd think they'd help them, at a minimum, use birth control and go to school. you can make your own future if you don't have children at 14 years old. i don't buy that it has to be an endless cycle. these people are one dimensional and show not one ounce of motivation for a better life."
2,Boring. Boring. Boring.,"Too many characters. Too vague. Too bad. I'm sure this could have really been a great book, however it failed miserably. Each page I turned, I kept thinking ""it's got to get better"". I just finished it. Trust me. It doesn't.Skip this one over. Pick up Wally Lamb instead."
2,Irritating Subject-Matter,I'll admit I didn't finish the book right up front- it was too frustrating and annoying. The people portrayed were not sympathetic or likeable. What is wrong with these people? I don't understand why none of them had ever seemed to have heard of birth control or why they were all so irresponsible and childish. Really painful to follow their inevitable foibles and complacent attitudes.
5,The Bronx Underbelly,"I have lived in the Bronx very near where this story began for 40 years, and so much of it rang true from what I have seen from this part of Bronx culture. It also was a great learning experience and really helps me understand experiences that I have not been a part of even though it happens right under my nose. I just wonder how LeBlanc could simply observe all of this and not try to help them change their worldview. There is so much that can be done, which is my motivation for remaining here."
4,A Deep Tale,"This book covers the story of Boy George Rivera, the Bronx Puerto Rican drug baron legend, through the eyes of one of his many girlfriends and her family and group of friends. The highlights of the book are the quotes from Boy George and LeBlanc crafts an exciting tale that weaves in and around the drug world that Boy George thrived in before his eventual incarceration. The book shows the devastation he left in his path while carving out his drug empire through the girlfriends he had and even the story is about him it is about so much more, including his whole community, family and friends. He is just the focal point and the lightening rod over which everything revolves. This book would make a great moving and it is one of the only books that covers Boy George's story beside Seth Ferranti's Street Legends Vol 1 which is written from the inside criminal perspective and has photos of Boy George from inside the belly of the beast.Street Legends"
2,Disappointing,"This book made a number of Top 10 list in 2003 but I beg to differ.It's maddeningly difficult to keep track of the sprawling cast of characters (particularly if you leave the book for a while). A ""Dramatis Personae"" would be very useful.The book is a not much more that a descriptive chronology with too few observations and distillations by the author. It's also long and the story could have been effectively told with 50% fewer pages.Given that the subjects' lives are not inherently that interesting, Le Blanc needs to add something. After while it all starts to blur and, in the absence of an thematic development by the author, you wonder why are wading through this."
5,Every American should read this book,"This is nonfiction about a culture most Americans know nothing about. It is a revealing look into a lifestyle that includes welfare, drugs, single motherhood, sexual abuse, and domestic abuse. If you ever find yourself asking ""How could they live like that?"" or ""How do people get to that place?"", this book is for you."
2,interesting but too long,"I usually finish books in a week or two, but this book took me about 2 months to finish. The first half of the book was interesting and I kept thinking there would be a climax coming, but there never was. The second half of the book seemed to drag on and on, and I couldn't wait till it ended. The subject was interesting and some plots were unbelievable, but it never really had an official ending or climax. I understand it was a non-fiction but it bored me to death. I wouldn't recommend it."
2,Not my kinda thing.,This book seemed as though it had potential but after reading it I realized it read like a long outline or something? Like a synopsis of the story instead of really getting into it. My two stars are way too much for this author.
3,"Fascinating insight , but...","1. There were too many minor characters -- I had difficulty keeping track of them all2. After spending 10 years documenting these lives, the book just stopped cold -- perhaps the author is planning a sequel in the future, or at the least, adding an epilogue in the next printing so the readers can get an idea of what happened to these characters.3. There's a little too much detail on some minor occurences (i.e. Lourdes and Coco's many moves), making the book a little too long. It could have easily been cut by 100 pages to tighten it up.Overall, it was pretty good, but far from great."
4,Chilling Insider View of Poverty,"This book was absolutely amazing. I could not put it down. I don't think I will ever read a better book that looks into the lives of others in such a straight forward way. I hope this becomes required reading in high schools and colleges across the country. It really shuts down that whole theory of ""if they would just get a job"". This book takes it's readers into the entire cycle of inter-generational poverty. It gives a hard look at the obstacles people face to ""make it"". I left off one star because I thought the book desperately needed a conclusion. I felt like the ending was just another day-in-the-life-of and didn't do the book justice. Still, I highly recommend this book and I will definitely be looking forward to other books from this author."
4,"Heartbreaking, Frustrating...","I read this book well over a year and a half ago and I stll think about the characters. It saddens me to know that people truly live this way and don't see anything wrong with it. It's sickening but real, raw, compelling and heartbreaking all at the same time. I will agree with many of the reviwers and say that there are a few too many characters and a lot of extra activity going on in the background - it's distracting and makes the story hard to follow at times. Stories like this and ""Push"" are harsh reminders of how common a way of life this is for so many people. It's sad and frustrating to know that unfortunately, the cycle will repeat itself and continue on."
4,This Book Helped Me Better Understand the Culture of Poverty,"I could not put this book down. I come from such a different background, yet I identified so much with these women in their struggles for love, acceptance and security. The valiant attempts of CoCo and Jessica to survive was mind boggling and inspiring. The author really captured the entire culture in a way that was neither condescending nor pitying.My only complaint with the book was at times it was hard to believe these women went back to the men and the life that had so harmed them. Although true to life, it was hard to swallow."
3,"Good, but here's a better book","This book is good but I felt that the characters were one-dimensional for the most part. You won't waste your time by reading this book but if you read only one non-fiction book in this genre make it THE CORNER: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood, by David Simon & Edward Burns."
2,A challenging book,"The people in this book have lots of sex, the guys sell drugs, the guys beat the women, the guys verbally abuse the women, the women have babies, the women keep coming back for more abuse and sex, the guys go to jail, the women go to jail. There are many, many characters in this book, most of whom have funny names. These characters drift in and out of the action and it's very, very hard to keep track of them. I guess this book provides insight into how one segment of society lives but reading it is like doing an assignment for sociology class.This is a non-fiction book but I am wondering how this author was a fly on the wall of these people's most intimate moments for years and years. I think it would be odd having a writer hanging around your house recording everything that went on for for, like, ten years."
4,It was alright..,"This story was an ok read. There were too many characters to keep my attention on the storyline. I think this book is a little overrated with all the five star reviews on Amazon. I learned a couple of things about the Bronx and how Puerto Ricans live, but besides that it was just alright.Rating 3.5 -4.0"
1,Not A Good Read!,"I thought this book would have more depth. This book was shallow and there were too many changes and they were happening too fast and the book went through so many characters, it was ridiculous. After a while I didn't know who was who and I did not want to finish the book. Not a good book at all."
2,Cheap but not very good,"I was surprised to find wasabi peanuts for such a low price, but after receiving them I now know why. These will certainly clear your sinuses, but quality is poor. These would best be described as one part tiny, stale peanut and four parts crunchy wasabi coating dumped into 2 one pound bags. Learn from my mistake: pay a little more and get less for higher quality in a tin.On a positive note, the vendor was prompt with the shipping. Their other products are probably good, but this one is not."
1,Cheap knock offs are not that hot,"I remember years ago the first Wasabi peanuts I bought from a local gourmet food store were 100 times hotter then theses cheap knock-offs.They were truly wasabi covered peanuts. These peanuts are covered first in a layer of soybean paste than a very thin coating of wasabi for color. I would say they are using a green food colored horseradish not true wasabi.If you like something crunchy and very mild heat, buy these. They are like eatting M&M; candies. I read the other reviews before buying and all said ""Wow these are HOT! I say Bologna!Which goes to show... you can always make something cheap."
3,asian noir a little low on the rice,"remarkable for being a full blown video haiku at the very start with a starting credit sequence that falls nothing short of magnificent. absorbing dialogue if wordy at times and runs short of story as a whole.. ....but the four stars come for some gritty acting by chow and kaneshiro and the subtle sensuality that threads through the movie. there will be complaints, but, gosh who would have believed contemporary asian noir was possible?"
4,sleepless town,sleepless town is a movie about the chinese mafia in japan.takeshi kanashiro plays the staring part he is also known as the johnny depp of asian movies.the movie is vey 4 out of 5 well done and the acting is very good..i rated this movien 4 out of 5 .i think that you would enjoy this movie. i know that i did.
2,Disappointed...,- The storyline is very weak- The cinemaraphy is good though- Overall is below what I expected- Suggested to watch y'L if people like Yamamoto Mirai
2,MsCrys,"This is not a good horror movie. It is a bit funny though, which is why I give it two stars. The acting is hilarious. It is not scary and the premise is nothing new. A bunch of college kids having a party and people die."
4,They don't make 'em like this anymore.,"C'mon guys!A film like this doesn't need a 500+ word review. You can't do that to a film of this nature. 80's teen horror set in a sort of sorrority/fraternity setting. Been there. Done That. Except this one opens with the cheesiest music video known to man that takes place in the annals of a drive-in snack bar and gets cheesier from there. You either love it or hate it, there's no grey area. I have to admit, the possessed chick during the final 20 minutes did spook me a litte. Get this one if you miss the old 80s drive in movies...you'll thank me later for it. LOL"
1,Horrible Horror!,"This horror movie is horrible! The plot is horrible, the direction is horrible, the acting is horrible and the movie is horrible! Don't waste your time or money and instead watch good horror movies like Halloween, Psycho, The Shining, etc!"
5,You MUST ignore the first 10 minutes of this film.,"This is a prime example of a film maker using the first 10 mintunes of film to completely RUIN the audience perception. In fact, you can simply fast-forward or ignore the first 10 minutes. They have ABSOLUTELY no bearing on the rest of the film. I am not exaggerating. No bearing whatsoever. The (ugly) 80's hair band with a bad song is an instant turn off and if you can simply get past that, the film is a decent 80s slasher flick. I can not imagine what sort of mindset caused anyone to add such a horrid opening to any film."
3,For Old Ladies,"Miranda Esmonde seems to have picked exercises from a wide variety of sources and mish-mashed them together, and called it ""Classical Stretch,"" a catch-all title. She has chosen pleasant music (some of it Classical), and she has a pleasant attitude. She says all the stretches (some are not stretches, but are more like calisthenics) feel ""Wonderful."" I find that after I do the tape, my back and hips are looser, which is to be expected from doing stretches and gentle movements for an hour. I think I will try a ballet warm-up tape next if I can find one. I would recommend this tape for someone who wants a mix of mild exercises led by a person who seems genuine."
1,Too Much Guess Work....,"It's a shame, because I think Miranda might be onto something in the Classical Stretch workout series which is combination of stretching and toning. Unfortunately, she is too busy talking about herself, her daughter, her makeupartist - and everything BUT what she should be talking about. She goes on and on about how great her workouts are and how many celebrities and athletes she has trained. However, she gives very little instruction on how to do the exercises and very little advice on form. I don't have the time or patience to use the pause or slow motion button to figure out what exactly she is doing. Good form is the single most important factor while doing any exercize because without good form, you will not get the benefits of the exercise and you could possibly get injured. After trying this workout three times and still not quite sure on how to master the exercises, I've given up on the esmonde technique.... There's just too much guess work."
1,Terrible Video,"This is NOT a stretch video. The ""Athletes Intense Stretch"" portion is an aerobics routine that looks like a mix between tai-chi and jazzercise. The only moves resembling stretching are dynamic, bouncing movements, which is the incorrect way to stretch. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A STRETCHING VIDEO, DO NOT BUY THIS ONE.I have tried ""Total Stretch for beginners with Tami Lee"" and ""AM and PM Stretch"", and they are both much much better than ""Full Body Workout""."
4,All out of shape,"I like it. I have had dance classes in my younger days. The tape is run like a dance class. I have been using it for about a month now and I am starting to see the effects. The best part is she has exercises for ""Old Lady flabby arms"" and they work. The worst thing about the CD is she talks about her daughter and her makeup man too much. All in all I Love it."
4,I liked it!,"I thought it had great suspense and yes, it was gruesome in parts but we are talking about a serial killer here....I enjoyed the story of Lindsey and Judd. Furthermore, I could understand why Lindsey would act the way she did (I didn't always agree with it - she sometimes did behave like a doormat). But, we can't always help who we fall in love with, can we? I'm sure this was the case with Lindsey as well.This was my first book by Barton, but it definitely will not be my last (finished The Murder Game already!). I love the characters in these books (especially Griffin & Nicole) and I can't wait to read more about all of them!!"
3,the dying game very good title!,"well this book was a bit grizzly for me. Graphic detail on the killings. Author really did her homework on serial killers that's for sure.Just a little bit to muchfor me with judd and lindsay ""does he love? Do I love him?"" give it up already. Liked the rivalry thou between nicole baxter and Griffin Powell, would like to read more about these two. If there is a sequel to this I might be intrigued to read it. Thanks birdladypoole"
2,Disgraceful Characters,"While the plotline of this book was interesting, I knew who the killer was immediately upon being ""introduced"" to him. Beverly Barton should've been less obvious about that because it really took away from the enjoyment of the storyline, which was otherwise decent.But I can only give it 2 stars because the characters were awful, especially Lindsay. What a pathetic, disgusting excuse for a woman. And Judd wasn't much better. It was hard to care about either of them or hope for anything other than them both being killed by the BQK.I hope the next book, which looks to be a continuation of this one that focuses on Griff and Nic, is better."
2,There's only one reason to read this book!,"Beverly Barton usually delivers, but she lost me with The Dying Game. The lead characters are pathetic, needy, and unlikable. By the end of the book, I didn't care what happened to them. The only reason you should read this book is to get the background set up on Grif and Nic. Now there's a pair I'm looking forward to reading more about. Grif and Nic outshine the lead couple so much so that I found myself skimming parts just to get to Grif and Nic's interactions. Grif is really overbearing, but I have a feeling Nic is going to knock him down a peg or two in the next book in the series. The story line in The Dyine Game will keep you interested but you'll definitely get tired of the lead couple. Guaranteed! Treat this book as a prequel to the ""real"" story that's coming in Febuary, 2008."
3,I usually realy love Ms. Barton novels but ..........,I was so looking forward to this book when she gave us a preview in her last novel but the entire book read like a prologue for her next book. The hero was a drunk and a bully and the herine was a [...] push over. I am however looking for to the next book with Nic Baxter and Griffin Powell. They have great chemistry and I found myself skipping over Lindsey and Judd parts of the book just to get to more of Nic and Gif. Their book will be out in Feb 2008.
2,Disappointed,"I am a huge Beverly Barton fan and I was so looking forward to reading the Dying Game. I've never thought I would give Ms. Barton a bad review, but the Dying Game is disappointing. Lindsey is the most whiny, pushover, weakest, ""heroine"" in romantic suspense history. I wanted to slap her every time she showed up in the novel. She and Judd had zero chemistry and I found it unbelievable that those two belong together. Like some of the other reviewers, I found myself skimming past the Lindsey and Judd bad soap opera storyline to get to the rest of the story. I do like Griff and Nic Baxter and I am looking forward to their story. Hopefully Ms. Barton redeems herself with her next novel."
4,A Bit Grusome for my taste...,"I bought this book before I read the previous reviews or I probably wouldn't have bought it. After reading 'The Dying Game', I find that I'm not in agreement with those reviews. While it was a bit too graphic for my tastes, the desire to see these sick murderers brought to justice drove me to read on. This is not a romance novel so I don't understand why the previous reviewers hated the main characters in the book. Judd was fighting his own demons and not the typical romantic male lead that overcomes adversity easily. Lindsay loved him enough to help him fight those demons even though her assistance was not initially appreciated by Judd.I loved the ending and also look forward to the next book but thought this was worth the read for its own story and not just for the introduction to the next book."
3,"A Good, Basic Introduction","This text serves as a good, basic introduction to the concept of idea management. It is discussed from a higher level and can help some organizations set up a basic framework for identifying and implementing new ideas. It would be most helpful to those leaders and managers who do not find themselves that creative and need some assistance identifying who is creative and how to best tap into those resources.One area of weakness was that the book did not discuss implementation problems to the degree that is necessary for most organizations. This is the one area that generally troubles organizations the most. It did provide a basic framework, but little concerning the integration issues including; adapting to the current structure, organizational development, and cultural transformation, to name a few."
2,Not in good conditions,"The book is not in good conditions, Pages are highlitghed and have drawings, it hasn't meet my expectations, you can buy a new one in perfect conditions for just few more bucks."
4,Basic guidebook to managing innovation,"This book is useful even though, in itself, it's not all that innovative. In fact, if you have consciously been working on innovation, you'll find little or nothing new in it. However, it is an exceptionally clear compilation of the established ways to enhance creativity, guide innovation and manage your organization to support both. It does a great job of demystifying these often confusing concepts, and of making full use of diagrams, charts and capsule explanations. Its strengths are also its weaknesses: The brevity means some complex concepts are only sketchy. We therefore recommend this book to novices or methodical innovators - to the first as a guidebook and to the second as a reference."
1,Unprofessional,I recently had the opportunity to hear this man rant in the most unprofessional and bitter speech I have ever heard. It was too late for me...I had already purchased several of his books. They immediately went into the garbage where they belong! Teaching is my passion. I cherish the opportunity to work with every child. I was sad that this man represents teaching to many. Please consider purchasing books that are written from an educator's heart supported with sound research. Yes we all know that children should spend time reading. What about providing them with sound instruction? This is not something this man supports.
1,Not Impressed....,I buy lots of books about Creativity. This was a gift. There is some good advice in the book about techniques and publishing but the CREATIVE part that sucks me in was just not there!This books is more for the real serious writer wanting to know the ends and outs of what do with your writings once you have mastered your creativity.
4,Not for the faint hearted.,"Fictional account of two black young adults going from being for the most part normal people descending from that to full blown heroin addicts seemingly overnight. Also delves into the lives of other characters in the drug scene, one dealer in particular and a few other addicts. The author of this book, Donald Goines, along with Iceberg Slim (Iceberg Slim actually came first and was a big influence on Goines) more or less created the ghetto crime fiction genre. This wasn't a bad read but I found it to be a depressing story to read. I liked it but I wouldn't recomend it to the faint hearted."
5,"great author, gear up","Get ready for the best stories ever I love 70s movies and you can tell that this man is definitely from the 70s from his jargon to his style, I guess that era was all about drugs and pimps that was the hip thing, but he told his story very well I stayed in this book from start to finish never got bored it was so sad but it was intruiging as well, I love this man books great read definitely recommend all of his books, RIP MR GOINES"
5,COMPELLING & VERY DRAMATIC,DONALD GOINES HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF THE GRAETEST URBAN WRITERS OF ALL TIME...NOT ONLY DOES HE BRING THE REALNESS OUT OF EVERY SITUATION HE DOESN'T SUGARCOAT THE TRUTH...NOT EVERY STORY IS GOING TO HAVE A HAPPY TO WHAT HE IS WRITING ABOUT NO MATTER WHERE YOU COME FROM...I GO TO CLARK-ATLANTA UNIVERSITY AND THIS BOOK WAS REFERRED TO ME BY ONE MY PROFESSORS...I WILL ALWAYS THANK HIM FOR TURNING ME TO SUCH A GREAT WRITER OF ALL URBAN TIMES....
5,Very realistic and enjoyable.,I really enjoyed this book. It keep me interested and I didn't want to put it down.
5,Great Read.,"This book was a great read. Exciting, emotional, tragic and at times; appauling. I couldn't put it down. Great author and a must read book."
2,Kinda Grody,"This book was a big hit in the drug treatment center where I teach. However, I could not get past the first chapter, as it was really graphic and upsetting, to me. Of course, I want my students to read, but I think I may have just been encouraging most of them to mentally relapse. I don't know what to think, but I won't be reading this book any time soon. Sorry!"
5,Scary,"Whoa. This is truly one DEEEEEEP book. If The Coldest Winter, by Sistah Souljah shows you how the dealers and their families live large (until caught) then this book shows you the effects of using. And I mean down and dirty, in horrifying graphic detail the author tells how a junkie shoots up. What it feels like not to have a fix, how they lie, cheat and steal to get that next fix. I won't lie, this book scared the hell out of me! And anyone who knows somebody who might be even REMOTELY tempted to try that most devastating drug of all, herion, then they should read this book. You'll be afraid to take an asprin!"
5,THE GREATEST BOOK BY THE GREATEST AUTHOR,I give this book 10 Stars if I could. All of his books are excellent and I would recommend them to everyone who loves drama. It's real life to many people and it has the ability to put you right in the middle of it. This book brings out emotions that you can't get from just reading sometimes. I think that Donald Goines should have movies on all of his literature because they would be hits. And I mean HITS.... I hope this thought reaches a movie director.
5,dopefiend,"sad, trgic, man this ain't new to me being that i'm from the ghetto, it's impossible to be from the ghetto and not see drugs,a classic,goines like iceberg slim told it like it was 2 authors who will never get their props the only ones who could make stephen king look like mickey mouse, after reading this why would anybody do drugs, teddy got terri hooked on it and she goes from good girl to tramp, it can happen to anyone a shame how teddy treated her but that's what drugs make you do mistreat those closest to you, all the characters end up in bad shape except porky, teddy, snake, tim, red all got shot, minnie killed herself and terry seeing her body went insane, i doubt if she ever recovers, jean died of a overdose, this is sad it tells of what a drug addict will do for drugs sadly times have not changed only thing new is the drug scene changed and this is a new generation."
4,a great read in an unlikely area,"It is clear to everyone who thinks about the topic that traditional financial reports are a completely inadequate measure of overall corporate performance. But, like the weather, everyone talks about the issue and no-one does anything about it. Eccles et al have -- they have put forward concrete suggestions for making progress on this difficult issue. Congratulations also for the lucid and interesting prose style. This book belongs on every executive's book shelf."
1,Not as advertised,I was looking for a flint operated lighter with the same diameter and length as a cigarette. I had one of those several years ago. The product I received is taller and much thicker than a cigarette and uses crystal igniter. It failed by the end of the same day. Bad product!
3,Not the best,"This lighter is a good replica cigarette, but when I recieved this lighter the metal ring where it opens was stripped, and it doesnt light more than half of the time."
1,"Is convincing, but doesn't work well.","The lighter worked as intended for about a day. After that whenever I filled it up it would leak, and I could light it until it ran out which took about 5 min. I don't know if I broke it or if it was just defective, but I did nothing to it that nobody else would have done. I like that it is a flint lighter, and that you dont need to hold a button for it to keep going, I just wish that it worked properly. I'm going to tamper with it to see if i can get it to work."
1,get what you pay for,"whould have been nice if it didn't fall apart the 2nd time i flicked it, product came a little late yet well packeged. was very delacate near the open side and fill sidequick note: why would it sell for 17 dollars?"
1,Won't ignite.,The idea of a cigarette shaped lighter is great but I've worn out my thumb trying to get it to light. It is full with butane too.
1,worthless,This is cheep it broke the first time I used it. The cap fel off and it doesn't even light. Don't buy this its worthless.
1,Crap,"Poor Quality, broke the instant I went to fill up with fluid, not even worth the time to send back, so mad with this purchase!"
5,An unbelievable story and a great storyteller,"I was utterly amazed when I first learned that the U.S. drafted some of the very same Japanese-American men that the government interned on suspicion of disloyalty during World War II. I was further amazed when I learned that the government criminally prosecuted those among them who resisted the draft. This book tells this incredible story with balance, grace, and insight. The pages pull you along as you quickly get wrapped up in the lives of the resisters and those in the government and in their own ethnic community who opposed them. The highpoint of the book for me was Muller's account of the one resisters' trial that did not result in convictions. A lone federal district court judge bucked the government and dismissed the charges on the grounds that they offended basic notions of due process. This last story is a ""profile in courage"" particularly appropriate to our current circumstances. Read this book."
1,Real Bad,"I had looked forward to reading this book. Alas, there is something that is not quite right with it. First of all, McAmis' definition of Malay is quite misleading. His definition is a bit too liberal and too broad. Malay first and foremost in today's terminological use refers to Malays in Malaysia. While some Malays in Malaysia are likely to see Southern Filipinos, Indonesians, etc as their distant kinsmen, they're not very likely to call them Malays. 'Malay' is very strictly defined in legal terms in Malaysia. To broaden this definition as McAmis does is akin to saying that Vietnamese, Thais, Cambodians, Laotians are all 'essentially' Chinese. Apart from that, McAmis' research into Islamism in SEA isn't too illuminating. Judith Nagata has, in her essays, done a much better job. She has written about the dakwah movement and given such details that I am, as a Malaysian, completely amazed by how much she managed to ferret out of these communities."
3,What's your goal?,"If you just want to utter 10 words or so when you go to Italy, this is fine. If you want to understand how to construct a sentence and actually utter complete thoughts, I don't recommend this book. There are many, many language books out there that are simply geared to the American who wants to learn to utter a few very basic words when traveling. They are awful because if you really want to construct a sentence or phrase, good luck. This is of course the major complaint of most people who study these manuals - they travel and become embarrassed that they cannot communicate at even a basic level. I've been using Pimsleur and it's really a whole other method that gives you more possibility to communicate effectively."
5,Basketball Goal/Backboard/and Bracket,The Basketball Goal/ Backboard/ and Bracket...were excellent and were here quickly. Truth is...you sent me more than enough to make my grandkids dreams come true. Thanks
5,"Finally, a nice board that wasn't too expensive","We have a half court in our backyard, and our son shoots a lot of hoops. This is holding up beautifully, looks wonderful, and the price was right. I confess, I had a professional put it up, so I have no idea how hard installation was. I'm assuming it was a little rough, since my husband joined in on the ""fun."" But they had it up in an hour."
3,Builderguy,"Everything went fine after I got the assembly instructions. Wang wasn't on the ball that day and I'm not the only one (search ""reviews Spalding 79351"") Couldn't find them any where on the internet either without contacting the company direct. My advise...order the instructions first:)"
2,End user review,"Purchased product knowing it was on the lower end of the price scale. Received in 2 days. Had large defect in backboard. Also had to spend quite an effort to modify brackets to fit on existing pole. When ball hits backboqrd has very 'tinty' sound as plexiglass is not thick at all. So bottom line, from my experience...low price product = low quality. Will choose another product next time."
3,Just OK for the price,"I have seen similar backboards, and was aware of the thinness of the plastic polycarbonite material. It looks OK but the plastic is glued to the steel frame with black adhesive and is not perfectly flat. The rebound is OK, but not what I expected. At this price, it works well enough. I would say it works fine for informal use and kid's play, but this is not a backboard for the serious player."
3,This book was not bad but not the best either,Chan i think was a bit of a coward for not facing up to the full of things. I do not know if i would recommend this book to people with opinions.
4,Good Book-What you're looking for...,"If you're looking for a book that will grab your interests and keep you entertained while you're bored, this is it. Necessary Roughness deals with racism, prejudice, school, teenager years of a 16 year old Korean boy name Chan Kim. Chan moves from LA where he enjoys his culture/heritage, to Minnesota where it is full of white people and his family was the only Asian Family in town. This book has some surprises and suspense going but there was only min. racism, i thought he was the only asian kid in town along with his twin sister? There has to be more racism than that. The book has kinda moves from one problem Chan deals with to another without totally clearing it up..but overall its still a good book, if you're asian or football fan..its good to know you can relate to this book."
3,A Korean Family in Minnesota,"I read the book Nessesary Roughness. This book starts out with a Korean kid named Chan. He and his family moves to Minnasota because of their evil drug dealing uncle who needs more money to run a shop. As they rent a house in Minnesota, Chan and his sister has to go to school. While Chan is in school, three main parts occur. One, is when Chan makes a friend who asks him to play football. A second one is when Chan's sister wants to go out with Chan's friend but Chan's father said that she was to young. The third one is when Chan's sister dies in a car accident which changed the mood of the story. I think that this book was great. There are some Korean words in the book that people wouldn't understand but I undersood them all, because I am from Korea. I also think the author of this book did a fine job of making you understand the story."
1,GOOD BOOK!,"With credible personalities, and a respectable storyline, Necessary Roughness was a decent novel. Chan, the main character is a Korean teenager, who moved, along with his mom, dad and sister, from Lo\s Angeles to a very predominantly Caucasian Minnesota mountain town. Necessary Roughness shows how ignorance can lead to racism. I liked this book, and i think most other people would. I t was a good book, and i recommend it to anyone who likes a thought provoking, racially involved sports novel."
3,Necessary Roughness,"Necessary RoughnessChan Jung Kim was popular. He was the star on his soccer. That was until his family moved to a small town in Minnesota were football is the popular sport. No on has ever seen an Asian American family in this town before. To Chan and his little sister, Young, everything in their new school is different. Then, hoping to fit in, Chan joins football, but he still feels like an outsider. Now he tries to find what it really means to be Korean and how that is important. Find out if he learns to fit in, read Necessary Roughness by Marie G. Lee. This book is not only gripping your attention but funny and painful to. I liked this book because it showed how people with different cultures are discriminated against."
4,Time in a bottle before CC broke big!,"This is a nice little addition to your CC CD collection - a full-length LIVE concert by Boy and Company just as they were breaking big - warts & all, out of tune or not, the blue-eyed soul stylings and sheer star-making charisma of Boy are already on display here - buy early and often!"
3,Nice but not vivid on black fabric,"I used the white and red colors to make a design on a black t-shirt. It worked ok. After going over the white parts two or three times, it is more of a light grey color. The red is a good red but a bit dark.I tried them on paper and they look much better. The red is like a fire engine red.The fiberous tips of the paint pens tend to collect fibers from the fabric. It takes some patience, but these can be used on fabric.Overall, I would say they are not bad. They would probably be better for other uses. Next time, I plan to buy a jar of fabric ink and use small paint brushes."
1,Not for the security professional.,"The author of this book has a Ph.D. in organizational management. He is an ""expert"" in the security field; however, he has no clue. I bought this book for a master's level course in Security Admin and Management. The author took newspaper clippings and formed the book. He quotes himself throughout the book. Some of the challenges he has in the book are uninformed. Throughout the book he challenges government agencies and law enforcement. In the security field, the professional must partner with those organizations. I felt he discredited himself by page 100 and at that point, I found it difficult to read. Dalton may understand management; however, security management is more than telling people how many are needed to secure a location. There were some topics I didn't mind reading, but the majority of this book is rubbish."
3,Book confusion,"The book I received was not the same book that is in the picture. My teacher says there may not be a problem, but he said he would get back with me if I need to get another one. If so, I hope I can return it."
4,Very supportive,"Very supportive strong shoe for off road running. Good traction on rock and dirt. Maybe a little heavy because of the weatherproofing and rubber nose. I usually wear an 11.5 but this worked as a 12, especially for the downhills."
5,Excelent!,"I bought this converter when moving back from the US to Germany to support my NAS (network attached storage) - a device that runs 24/7. The power is more then sufficient so it is never overheated. I did not have a single problem, all is working just fine. Highly recommended. I would choose Simran-devices (I also have others) over any cheap chinaware."
4,"Works well, compact, sturdy","Well it works as advertised. I'm using it for an RC-30 Loop Station. The construction is sturdy, it's metal with plastic foot switches. It runs off one 9V battery, which is fine, and it's only on when there's a cable plugged in, with a bright LED indicator, so it's pretty easy to not forget to unplug the cables in order to save your batteries. I don't think it's an issue for this footswitch to need a power source. I've been using the same 9V battery that was included with the footswitch for months and it's still going.I'm only taking one star off because of the price. I think it's a bit pricey for a rather simple functionality. This shouldn't cost more than $30 in my opinion."
1,Boss FS 6,"what a wind up.No power socket,No leads and you need three to operate a Roland Cube 80XL .NO THANKS thats too much money for something simple. Glad mine was free with the Amp."
2,Poor combination with Roland amp.,"Footswitch works. But as others have said, the fact that I need to unplug the cable to turn off the battery is a bad design flaw, and the fact that there is no socket for external power is bad too. So I regularly forget and have to replace the battery.But in combination with my Roland Cube 40 XL amp, it gets even more bizarre. If I unplug the FS-6 to turn it off, and the other end is still plugged into the amp's select/solo footswitch jack, it locks up the amp into LEAD/SOLO mode, and manual switches on the amp can't change channels. So every time I want to turn off the footswitch I have to unplug the lead at BOTH ends!"
4,A Movie Fan's Delight,"Every page of this 160 page, hardcover book is filled with black and white and/or full color large photos. Includes: Top 10, Leading Men, Sex Goddesses, Tough Guys, Beauties, Every Guys, Artists, Comedians, Ingenues, Action Heroes, Rebels, Pros. Presents movie posters, and candid shots. Each chapter provides an interesting page highlighting the chapter. A beautiful book worthy of a place in a movie buff's library."
4,Good trip down memory lane...,"This DVD was pretty good. There was ALOT of focus on the Freebirds and Von Erichs, but not as much on other stars. I remember watching this w/ my Grandma and eating Dominoe's back in the day. Got it for my 9 yr old to help him learn the history of wrestling, so for that aspect, it's good"
3,It wasn't all in the box,"I liked it, but it was suppose to come with two disc and it only had one.... All of the matches were missing"
3,Rename This DVD.....,"I used to watch WCCW on ESpn after school.I bought this one , the WCW, ECW and AWA dvds at the same time. They should rename this the Von Erichs story, or the Von Erichs vs the Freebirds. This dvd only profile them. They did less than minute on Kamala, The Missing Link, Abdullah The Butcher, and The Great Kabuki. Not to mention did not metion the Dingo (Ultimate) Warrior which would have been cool for people who did not know where he started.Overall it's ok and details the tragic deaths of Von Erich family, still it leaves more to be desired."
2,great,didnt know what to expect when purchasing this dvd but it was very interesting when watching it. I was very shocked of what i learned while watching the story but bored watching the first match.
3,Could have been better.,"Don't get me wrong,I enjoyed this collection,and I think it's worth owning for anyone who was a fan of World Class.However,sometimes the match selection (or lack there of)by WWE really baffles me.How can you have a DVD about World Class without including a single match with Gino Hernandez,and the one that really gets me,how in the hell could you not include Kerry Von Erich's world title victory over Ric Flair in Texas Stadium??? That was probably the single greatest moment in World Class and Von Erich history,yet it's not on this DVD."
3,disappointed,"I am disappointed witht two things. First, there is no closed captioned at all for deaf. Second, I dont see Gino Hernandez and Chris Adams wrestled, just Von Erichs and Freebirds that is all. I hope in the future there will be more Gino Hernandez and Chris Adams in DVD."
4,Sad,This is a great documentary about the first family of wrestling the Von Erichs. I would have given the film more stars if the DVD had included better matches. Bring your tissue you will shed some tears.
1,Hated it!!!,I buy lots of wrestling d.v.d.'s.and can not even watch this one..SO BORING!!! Try it if you must.but I suggest you find another..
5,Why wwe???,Why did u put this dvd out now in 2007 or 2008?The new young fans wont buy this dvd u should have launched it bakc in 2000 or 2001 heck even 2003 but not now....i waited years for this dvd.Dumb move wwe
1,"HORRIBLE, TERRIBLE, NO GOOD, VERY BAD",It was totally horrible. It didn't even have them in it just pictures and fans. We don't want to see fans we want to see 'N SYNC. If I wanted to see their fans all I would have to do is go to school. BUYERS BEWARE. If I were you I would not be a buyer of this product. It doesn't even deserve 1 star more like - 1 or 1000000.
1,this video sucked!,"My name is Michelle, and as much as i LOVE n sync, i completely thought this video sucked.....they show no footage of the guys, and it was all about the fans...well.....NEWS FLASH....we want the guys, not the fans..... see ya, michelle"
1,"THIS VIDEO IS LIKE A VAMPIRE, IT SUCKS!","Well first of all they dont even talk to 'N Sync its like these people are stalkers all they show of 'em is stills and a little clip of them at the thanks giving parade. wow i have seen more thing about them in a mag. i do not recamend this 'N Sync video or shall i say this fan video thats all they show of them talking about how cool they were at the show. i'm sure you can find out for yourself by actually going to the show.later dayz, Mari"
1,Highway Robbery,"This video was a complete waste of my hard-earned money. I totally hated the hostess, Sedona, (what a ridiculous name). She had terrible teeth and her face was ugly. She didn't do anything except pronounce all the guys' names wrong and talk to idiot, screaming girls while they tried to win tickets to a concert. It really makes me mad how the losers who put together this video are making money off of us. I really wish I had read these reviews before I bought the video at the mall."
1,"DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO, THE GUYS ARE NOT EVEN IN IT AT ALL","whatever you do, do not buy this video. I am Nsync's number one fan, and I hated this video. Reason: it contained absolutely no footage of the guys. Only Magazine editors with weird teeth, and too much lipstick, and alot of fans, screaming alot. Save whatever money you have, and buy the new Music of My Heart Single."
1,This is the most boring video!!,"I bought this video thinking I was gonna see nsync, and what do I get------>a stupid woman talking to a bunch of girls about nsync. You dont even get to see them. What a bunch of chedder pure chedder!"
1,What was I thinking!!1,I never really liked n' sync now I know why. This video was so boring. I though I would give them a chance but this video turned me so off. I think you should stick with the best group video. Backstreet Boys ALL ACCESS!!!
1,Jesus....,How can a biography of N'Sync exist in the first place?? What great thing have they accomplished?? What musical contribution have they made so far??(not that they're going to) Biographys are supposed to be inspirational about peoples lives which were extraordinary. Your supposed to learn from it for God's sake!!
1,i didn't like it,"my mom bought the movie 4 me & my sister we thougt it was really boring because all there was in it were girls talking about nsync. And when we finally did see nsync all there was was a taped parade video of them waving,you couldn't even hear them talking!!!!!!!!!! personally i thought it was a ripoff. we THOUGHT there was going to be NSYNC on it but there WASN'T.PLUS the running time on the video was supposed to be 50 min. but instead it was 40 min. INCLUDING the credits. thank you for your time=)"
1,It was not what I expected,"I thought 'N Sync was actually going to be in the video. But it was BB editor and people talking about them. I wasted my money and I don't reccomend buying the video unless absolutely obsessed like me. And also, they pronounced Lance's last name wrong. Stay 'N Sync!"
1,HORRIBLE--WASTE OF MONEY,This has nothing to do with 'N SYNC. The offical movie is sooo much better. This is a waste of money with one weird reporter going around asking fans questions.
2,"n'sync is da bomb,but it doesn't enclude an exclusive on um.","YO WATZ UP!! OLIVIA TAYLOR WEST MICHIGAN/N'SYNC IS DA BOMB,BUT WOULDN'T IT COME TO YOUR SENSES TO NAME A MOVIE AFTER WHAT IT IS ABOUT... THE MOVIE WAS ABOUT A REPORTER TALKING TO FANS,I KNOW N'SYNC LOVES THERE FANS BUT THAT'S WHAT A FAN CLUB IS FOR,RIGHT!!!I MEAN GET REAL ON WHAT YOU NAME A MOVIE,AND JUST PLEASE MAKE SURE IT'S ABOUT THE TITLE SOME WHAT..99.9 PERCENT OF AMERICAS TEENS LOVES N'SYNC AND THEY REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING STUFF ON THEM ,HOW THEY GOT STARTED,AND WHEN THEY BECAME,ECT....WELL THANK YOU ALOT FOR YOUR TIME AND THANGS.IIII LOOOOOOOVE N'SYNC TO THE GRAVE............"
1,What I think about the N Sync: Unauthorized Biography video,If you are an nsync fan's fan or think you might be in in go ahead and buy this video by all means... because you won't see Nsync in it trust me...
1,"If I could, I would give it zero stars.","This video is nothing more than an attempt to make money off of a popular musical act. It is unauthorized, which means that there is not actual interviews with the group members, no actual playing of their music, and barely any actual footage of the members. What it DOES include are countless interviews with young girls and magazine editors, talking, not about the members themselves, but about the feelings fans have towards said members."
1,WORST THING I'VE EVER BOUGHT,I was so upset that I demanded my money back for false advertisement. NSYNC is NOT on this video. It's just a bunch of boring fans. DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO! 1
1,Don't waste your money,"The video STUNK! There was no member of N Sync on this video, it was just a bunch of screaming twelve year olds in tube tops! Don't waste your money on this video!"
1,Tell this to Bye Bye Bye,This video is all fans and no *Nsync! You can see and get all the information this video has from a magazine. Pass this one by.
1,NEVER BUY THIS!,"I BOUGHT THIS TAPE, EXPECTING IT TO BE AS GOOD AS THE *N THE MIX TAPE (WHICH IS AN EXCELLENT INVESTMENT). AS I WATCHED IT.... I JUST KEPT WAITING FOR @ LEAST A REAL LIVE TAPING OF THEM TO SHOW. I WAS WATCHING ONLY BECAUSE I WAS CONTINUOSLY WAITING AND HOPING FOR SOMETHING TO SHOW UP THAT WAS DECENT, SO I WOULDN'T HAVE TO RETURN IT. HOWEVER, IT ONLY HAD SOME LADY ASKING THE DUMBEST QUESTIONS TO 5 YEAR-OLD KIDS WHO PROBABLY ONLY HAD *//\\//SYNC'S CD. AND THE CLOSEST I GOT TO SEEING *//\\//SYNC, WAS A PICTURE IN THE BACKGROUND. SO, I AUTOMATICALLY RETURNED IT. MY RECOMENDATION WOULD BE TO NOT EVEN WASTE YOUR TIME BY BUYING IT."
1,This video should go bye bye bye and stay away forever!,"DON'T AND I MEAN DON'T GET THIS! IT IS A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY, THERE IS NO *N SYNC IN IT AT ALL! UNLESS YOU LIKE TO KNOW WHY FAN'S LIKE THEM BUT IF YOU ARE A FAN YOU SHOULD ALREADY KNOW. ALL THEY DO IS INTERVIEW FANS AND ASK WHY THEY LIKE NSYNC AND WHAT THEIR FAVORITE SONG IS, FRANKLY I COULD CARE LESS! I WAS EXPECTING NSYNC! THE CAMRA MAN IS VERY BAD TOO, ALWAYS MOVING THE CAMRA AROUND AND THE LADY DOING ALL THE INTERVIEWING IS VERY CORNEY! DON'T BUY IT!"
1,nsync dvd bites,This DVD is the worst thing out there! I'm A huge fan of Nsync so i had to buy it but to my surprise I hated it! All the movie had was a bunch of fans talking about them and no Nsync! The only reason you should buy this film is if you are planning to cut the 1 inch pictures off the dvd box!
1,Don't waste your money!,"This video is unauthorized so there isn't any real footage of N'SYNC. They are the best group out there but if you want to watch more videos of them, wait until their next authorized video comes out. All this one has on it are a bunch of fans talking about why they like N'SYNC and most of the facts are wrong. I was very disappointed."
1,"n sync rules, this video drools","If this video does not show anything on my main man, Chris Kirkpatrick... I do NOT want it. Chris is sooooo fine and his voice is so sweet. But I will not get this video, only if somebody spends money on it and gives it to me as a gift, I will accept it. But to take money from my own pocket---no way! Chris rocks."
2,So it's not a great video Big Deal !!!,"I think anyone who has bought this video will admit it is poor quality. But I consider myself a true fan who loves anything with NSYNC in it. You want quality then stick to the Official Video, and the official Book but I guarantee you're the one's who will miss out.I collect all their books, CD's, videos (I even have one in Pal format that I cant even watch yet becuz you can only view it in Europe) Every Poster I can find including some I bought online from Germany. When all is said and done I'm happy with everything I've bought even this video. I rated it two stars because you do get glimpses of the guys and if it were just one glimpse it would be worth it."
3,What?!? I thought it was gonna be better,GOSH! talk bout' a stupid lady! all she did was ask little five year old girls who their fave was. and then what song was their fave! half of theses people diden't even know the song names! What kinda hard core *N Sync FANatic is that?? Gosh well anyways I thought it could be a lot better! Hey it's still *N SYnc though!
1,I love *NSYNC but this sucks!,All this video is fans talking about *NSYNC it has no relation to them. DON'T buy it. It was the worst and most unuseful thing on *NSYNC. Even the Backstreet Boys are better then this crap!
1,Waste of money,"it is a total waste of money! there is no real n sync info. i love this line, ""you've got justin, jc, chris, and lance. whos your favorite?"" im not saying i like joey but come on, how could you forget him? DONT BUY IT! I did, and now it is collecting dust under my bed!"
1,Don't buy it.,There is a dumb girl who walks around and talks to annoying ditzy girls. They son't even talk to the guys. All they do is show pictures of them. The girl doesn't even pronounce their names right. It doesn't even deserve one star. So PLEASE take my advice and DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO.
1,Teenyboppers: The Movie!,"Wow! What a masterpiece, I laugh so hard at the teenybopper's stupid answers to their dumb questions. The ugly girls who like them is a laugh riot. Prove to you that fans that love them too much are too ugly for boys to date them."
1,do Not buy this video,"UGH! If I could put less than 1 star I'd put negative 5. First of all, its unauthorized--which means N Sync has nothing to do with it. All it is are people giving their opinions of N Sync. This girl goes around asking people the same questions.. Who's your favorite?...What's your favorite song? And of course, 85% of the answers were Justin...because he's cute."
2,A total waste of money,This is a horrible video!!! All it does is interview some fans and it gives you about 1 minute of info about 'N SYNC and they can't even pronouce Lance's last name right. I would give it one star but since it is about 'N SYNC I will give it 2. Ya have to buy it though cuz it is about 'N SYNC.
1,STUPID STUPID STUPID,"Ok I have this movie and all I wanna say is STUPID! I mean I am a big 'N Sync fan as the next person but this vid! I mean c'mon! Ok I thought ok this is going to be good but it was the most stupidest movie I ever saw! I mean ain't nobody cares about what that girl says! It don't even show them talking not once! It don't show anything about them except for the fans! I mean who cars about that? No offense or anything but this is the most pathetic, boring thing that I have ever saw in my life! It's just another way for stupid people to make money off us fans!"
1,If you ever want to kill someone make them watch this video!,This was the worst movie ever made. It was absolute crap the first(and only time) time I watched it I almost cried it was so bad. As a fellow NSYNC lover please dont waste your money the girl in was cheesy and a ditse and disgraced NSYNC. Thanks
1,Not worth it.,"A didn't buy this video afriend did and I'm glad that I'm not like her. She buys anything with their faces on it. That is sad, but she doesn't know any better. Now the unauthorized BSB video was actually worth it. At least you can see when they were first starting out. This video is a total heaping pile of S---!!!!!!!!!"
1,it is a waste of money,my friend got it and i almost fell asleep. it just shows fans ( at least they think their are fans) repeating the same thing. it doesn't so but 2 pics of *NSYNC. so take my advise and get N' The Mix.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!,"This video was HORRIBLE! My cousin pressured me to buy it, but i said no at first cause i saw it said ""unofficial"" but i bought it cause it was about *NSYNC. When i brought it home to watch it, i was VERY disapointed. I didn't even watch the whole thing, i watched about 15 minutes of the video then turned it off, I had the tape about a year and never even touched since then. I was gonna take it back, but i never did. Why? I don't know..."
1,They never showed 'N Sync!,I bought this video tape and was very unhappy with it. It didn't once show 'N Sync. The whole video was of a woman asking 'N Sync fans questions about 'N Sync. It didn't give you any interesting facts about the guys and it NEVER showed them. They were not in this video at all. All you saw was fans answering questions about them like Who is your fav member of 'N Sync. I would not recomend this video to anyone.
1,Do not buy this!,"This is the dumist video ever. They play the same thing over and over. They don't know nothing about them, they forget to mention that Joey is also in the group. It does'nt even have interviews with the guys. Please don't waste your money on this [production]."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,*NSYNC is the BEST but this video didn't even have them in it. All it was was a bunch of fans being interviewed. This was a waste of time and money. Definatly buy *N The Mix but until now don't bother buying and *NSYNC video unless it's Offical. This video shouldn't shouldn't even deserve to have *NSYNC's name on it. i_luv_babyblue!!!
1,Please avoid this film!,"It's a great pity that I have to write this about a Yuen Biao film. I really wanted to like a film which features Yuen Biao in a pseudo-Indiana Jones role, but it was impossible. Biao has starred in some classics like Kid From Tibet, Kickboxer, Project A and Millionaires' Express, but this easily ranks as his worst. The popularity of the Shaolin kids films was clearly the inspiration here, therefore you know that weak and crude comedy is the order of the day. In fact, the comedy makes Wong Jing look like Noel Coward in terms of subtlety. I at least expected good action, but Biao is totally wasted there as well. If you haven't got the message yet, DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM!"
3,Good entertainment but not suitable for kids,"I watched the uncut official DVD of this, so it has an extra minute of the most gross-out sicko bathroom humor ever devised by sick minds. Very strong R-rate material. This is actually rated a light R equivalent, because certain body parts and partial nudity are considered less taboo in Hong Kong than in more puritanical societies. As for the story, it is very entertaining, and a good action comedy. Would have been a great family comedy, but with the R rating material mixed with a lot of kid humor, it has a limited range of interest to most adults. There is a light romantic banter between Yuen Biao and Vivian Hsuen which redeems the movie some, and overall it is pretty good anyway."
4,Excellent phone,"CNET gave this phone a less than stellar review, but they utterly missed the point. Not everyone wants a phone/computer/camera/e-mail retriever/Klingon translator/backhoe/satellite TV. Some of us just want a dependable phone with outstanding battery life, solid reception that doesn't drop calls and sounds good. This sturdy little unit does all that with aplomb, takes bearable pictures, has a very decent speakerphone, is bluetooth capable, and has PTT for those so inclined. I weathers abuse well and the battery life runs circles around every cell phone I've had previously. If you want a phone that does everything under the sun, but none of it very well, this is not the phone for you. If you're intent on a phone that is an outstanding phone, this unit should be on your list."
5,Excellent Phone,"Solid phone. I've yet to have a dropped call. Bluetooth connects effortlessly. The feel of this phone is most excellent. These other thin phones and my big hands don't blend well. I like the feel of the v365 in my hand. I can't say enough good things about this phone. I have had RAZR's, L2's, E62's, and Treo's... this is my favorite phone ever."
4,"mostly good, a little bad","Firstly, this is a good phone. It's durable, decent battery life, and good features. The sound quality is also very good. The bluetooth is great.Now my gripes...You have to pay extra for the software to connect the phone to your computer. I can't believe this is not included right out of the box. The PTT (push to talk) button is in the worst place ever and is always getting accidentally pressed. This is particularly annoying because PTT is a pay service. It is a fat phone too, and wont fit in the cell phone pocket in my pants. The camera is so-so, but not unusual for most phones.All in all, I am moderately satisfied with this phone. It's big, and no software was included, but it is reliable and durable."
3,Above average basic phone,"Pros: Excellent voice quality, long battery life, blue tooth is good, web email download is good.Cons: Fat phone, won't fit in the normal cell phone pocket in trousers; not so good camera, Extra money for the software for downloading from PC to cell phone and also seprate cable, unusable PTT.I am moderately satisfied b'cas of the good voice quality and long battery life, otherwise it is just a basic phone."
4,Very good Wolverine story,"I don't usually enjoy superhero comics that much, but i have to say that Bloody Choices is a very entertaining book. It is a little hard to get, and is a bit short, but i would recommend anyone to pick it up. The story is more mature in nature than your typical Wolverine book, which is a welcomed change from your typical good guy vs. bad guy plots. In summation If you can find it definetly pick it up, it's a good addition to any collection."
2,his no return policy is a bummer,"no return policy, definitely an overpriced item and long mailing time. The item arrived intact and in excellent condition however."
5,35mm film Holder for Nikon scanner 4000 and 5000,This is a fragile items and more and more difficult to find as Nikon do not distribute this item.I advise you to have a spare in your drawer if like me you are scanning each day.JP
2,a weak finish for a good start,"Being a CYF fan, I borrowed this DVD hoping to find a masterpiece like HARD BOILED or THE KILLER. Despite being a ganster film, much like a poor man's GODFATHER, TRIADS is entertaining, and, if you're into heavy action, well, this is it.It drops at the end, but that's OK, for the movie is entertaining and very watchable."
5,Great for the price!,This product is perfect for small ponds and not expensive....It installed easily and lights up my little 80 gallon pond just fine...It really adds beauty to my little garden and pond after the sun goes down.Glad I found it because other lights were rediculously priced for people that have small hand made ponds...
3,Something to consider,"This is a cute little light, but what I didn't consider is the algae factor. I have the light in my Koi pond and the lens gets covered in algae within a week, then it is not even visible. Therefore, I wouldn't recommend this item for any water feature that isn't kept crystal clear."
2,These lights do not work very long,I purchased three of these fountain lights. Two of them broke in less than one year. I was quite satisfied with the product until they stopped functioning. There appears to be a quality control issue with this item which should be resolved. I cannot recommend this item to others.
1,Desposible Light,"This light was terrific...........for about one month. Then it died. I tried to revive it by replacing the light bulb, but apparently that is not possible. I can't find a source to buy a replacement bulb, and I can't figure out how to remove the old bulb. So I guess the whole thing is designed to be disposable."
3,Sunterra,"This product gives you exactly what you pay for. Good for small ponds/area. I use the product in my small backyard pond, it lights a small area of the pond, would have preferred more light. A bit small."
4,Does the job,I wish it was a little brighter but I should have ordered one with 2 or more lamps for the 36in fountain we have.
1,Nothing but issues!,"This is my 3rd time purchasing underwater lighting for my fountain. The first one I had lasted over a year. The second one I had lasted a few months and this one lasted only 3 months. Don't know why... Changed the light bulbs, checked the connections etc. all to no avail. I hope other people have a better experience with them than I did."
2,Not Reliable,"This is a fairly powerful underwater light. It looked really nice in my small water garden. Unfortunately, it lasted only a few weeks. Apparently, it's not made for underwater use. I bought another brand and that one is working out well."
1,Poor Quality,"Light worked great for about one month. I would not recommend this item. Also, you could barely see the light on a 36"" round fountain."
5,excellent production and content,"This cd is excellently produced and has a unique vibe to it while exploring a few different styles, glad I found it!"
3,Yes!,"I heard Gil Shaham play for the first time on A&E's ""Breakfast with the Arts"".The noises referred to by the previous reviewer were incredibly distracting, especially during the 25 minute sonata performance.I tried to figure out the source and it didn't look like the bow, but I don't know. I thought it was a technical problem at the television studio, but if it's on the cd I'd be less likely to purchase it.Mike Rudnick"
1,"Beautiful music, but intolerable breathing","I love this music of Faure. Wonderfully played, but sadly, I simply could not stand the heavy breathing and had to trash the disk after only one play. I just don't understand how the recording studio can issue it like this. They could have at least given the performer a tissue beforehand. I also scrapped all my Glenn Gould albums for his humming, so it gives you an idea where I stand on this ""bonus"" material. I admire those who can look (hear) past such things, but I don't know how to trick my brain in that manner."
3,Agree about the extraneous noises!,The playing is wonderful but I found the extraneous noises referred to by two earlier reviews to be exceedingly irritating. Sounds very much like heavy breathing to me. A real shame as I find I cannot listen to this CD anymore.
5,Douhet's Command of the Air,"This book truly shows the beginnings of Air Power theories. This book was written in an attempt to talk the Italian government into using Airpower as a new weapon. Douhet initially failed in this venture, but the Italians later realized their mistake. While the views and opinions of Douhet are at times extremely different from airpower today, and may seem a little ridiculous, this is certainly excellent reading for those who wish to begin learning about the origins of airpower theory."
3,A little pricey,"A classic book, but I'm not sure they should charge $32 dollars for it considering you can get a PDF for free if you just google it."
3,Refreshing Visuals,"I viewed this DVD prior to visiting Kaua'i, and though it's a pretty standard travel film, the visuals were good and caught much of the beauty of the island. The drawback of the DVD was the narration, which at times bordered on the downright corny. After visiting the island, it was good to watch the DVD with only the musical soundtrack, avoiding the often trite and annoying comments of the narrators."
3,"Not Bad, But Not Great Either","At this point I have tried several products made by the people at Buffalo Bills, and certain facts are starting to stick out. First off, they are salty, just go in knowing that, if you don't like salt, these are not right for you. The texture is fine, the flavor is fine, all and all they are OK, but I would be hard pressed to endorse them completely, and I do not think that I will be purchasing them again."
2,Too much salt!!!!,"These were way to salty. Iam a little disappointed because I was really looking forward to theses beef sticks. Even after reading all if the reviews, some good , some not so good, but I decide to give it a try myself. And now I wish I hadn't don't know how iam good to finish the rest and I doubt anyone in my family would like them and I don't have a dog to give them too. The hot skinny Minnie's are WAY WAY better !!"
3,Just Okay.,"These have the potential to be really good, but I found them to be way too salty. The saltiness over powers any other flavor they might have!"
2,Just Ok,"This package of beef sticks didn't exactly meet my expectations. Two things immediately came to mind when eating: 1. the beef sticks are as hard as rocks! The sticks are so hard to bite into and then chew, my jaw ends up getting sore after only one piece; definitely not good. 2. Way too salty! The flavor of the beef is masked by an undeniable taste of too much salt.I think I only eat 1-2 pieces a week, simply when I need a quick protein source; I wouldn't recommend these to people, especially if they are looking to a tasty and fun to eat snack."
3,Salty,"These do taste good. Be aware that they are very salty though. A bit tought to bite into as well, hope you dont have dentures. They may fall out"
1,Fine as a first ever knit pattern book,I was very disappointed in the book. I am a relatively new knitter but almost every pattern was in another book - original designs are not her specialty. But more disappointing than the patterns was the complete lack of spiritual insights. Nor were there suggestions for soulful knitting. The title is misleading to say the least. I sent the book back immediately for a full refund thanks to Amazon's return policy.
4,my favorite of the series,This book really has an interesting plot and moves along with it. It is much more a mystery than usual and I enjoyed it very much. Of course there are the usual antics of the animals - they are endearing. I almost always pick up one of these books when I've had it with the world and want something comfortable to slip into. This one's a particular pleasure.
4,Is Mrs. Murphy getting old?,"Sorry to say this story is not up to par, it reminds me that the writter is tired of this story line and only tells this tail for the money.Readers do have expectations, one of mine is to be able to see the person writting through the story. I have all of the Mrs. Murphy books, sorry Rita Mae."
2,disappointing,"This book can not decide whether to focus on the murder mystery at hand or the social lives of its characters. The animals have lots of dull philosophical conversations that are unecessary and take away from the story as a whole. ""Catch as Cat Can"" is easily the worst book in the Mrs. Murphy series."
1,Worst book I ever read,"So my girlfriend made me read this book. I almost broke up with her because of it. I mean, come on people! Nothing happens in the book, the cats who are supposed to help solve the ""mystery"" don't lift a paw, the whole thing is so bad and convoluted that at the end, the author has to explain to you all the things that happend that she couldn't manage to fit into the book somehow, so there was no way for you to even have any clue at all what was happening.Look, I love cats. They're cool. This book made me want to kick cats and the author. Don't waste your time unless you like falling asleep in the middle of scenes that are supposed to be ""action"" or getting really angry that you paid for this book. (I didn't...my girlfriend loaned me hers. I gave it back. Good riddance.)"
2,A good series going downhill -- and where's the editor?,"It's unfortunate that writers, particularly mystery writers, can't seem to bring a series to a conclusion before they run out of inspiration -- and plots. Again, Brown wraps up the plot neatly in the last few pages using information never divulged in the book -- is the mystery why anyone bothers to read a mystery that can't be deduced from the clues present in the book? And again, the animals get all the best lines. It would help if the humans got as much character development as the cats, dog, and horses (not to mention the owl and the blue jay!)And where's an editor when you need one -- to remind the author that her main character has always been a blonde?Bottom line -- not worth the time or the money."
1,Really bad karma.,"If you are looking for junk to read this is the book to do it with. The only descent thing about it is that darling Rita has finally gotten around to calling Cynthia Cooper a deputy sheriff (which she is) rather than a police officer (which she isn't). It will be interesting to see if this holds true in the rest of the forthcoming books Rita insults our intelligence with in the Murphy series.This book, like the rest of the Murphy series, if basiclly for those of us with nothing better to do. If you really want to read it go check it out at your local library like I did.I wonder if Disney will ever get around to making a movie out of this one like they did with ""Rest in Pieces""."
2,just a little logic,"We don't got to a Sneaky Pie Brown mystery for a serious puzzle or realistic police work. Still, there needs to be just a little reality.A perfectly healthy young man falls dead at a party. A sheriff's deputy is there--yet NO ONE tries CPR. No one calls the paramedics, either. No one considers that it might be a crime scene, not does anyone try to convince the decedent's brother he ought to have an autopsy. (I believe in some jurisdictions an autopsy would be required for such a suspicious death. Even if not required by law, surely the law enforcement officers would encourage one.)Others' points about the quality of editing are also true.The illustrations are even more charming than usual, and almost worth the price of the book."
3,could be better,"I was excited to get the seat as I had been looking for a reasonably priced one (I have two shih tzus so I have to buy two seats-pricey!) It looks exactly how it is pictured. The extra storage pockets are handy. However, I am buying new seats because the ""stabilizing bars"" which hold up the sides of the seat are not up to par-to say the least. My pups do not like sitting in the seat because the sides fold down on them and then they are basically sitting on top of the seat, not inside. Then they start twisting around on the harness and get tangled and I inevitably have to unlatch them from the seat at a red light! They might as well not have the doggie car seats. Not only are the ""stabilizing bars"" non-functional, one has already broken, leaving it to be even more of a disappointment. If these car seats were made with sides that stood up by themselves, which seems to me to be an obvious feature in any item like this, the seat would be great."
5,Very Satisfied,"I was very pleased to find this recording, and quite satisfied with my order and the prompt delivery. Joan Sutherland is amazing!"
4,"Informative, but repetitious","If you're looking for a traditional Catholic book about angels, this is an excellent choice. On the downside, many of the topics covered were supported using the exact same scripture, saintly quotes and stories. Although aptly applied, the frequent repetitions made the book feel tedious in places."
5,Hilarious,"This is laugh-out-loud funny. A reviewer who said the commentaries were hard to find wasn't looking too hard because if you play each episode individually rather than just ""Play All"" it gives you a choice before each one that has a commentary to turn it on or off. I am sorry this series did not get a chance to develop. You really have to follow the dialogue to get the good jokes. It is like Seinfeld in Superhero suits."
2,"BAD, REALLY BAD","Yikes! This had an awful pilot and it went downhill from there. The jokes are dragged out forever; the physical jokes fall flat, the acting is so bad that it makes you cringe. A dud."
1,Oops - it's not the cartoon,"I bought this from a GoldBox offer and then realized it was not the cartoon! I haven't received it yet, and already I hate it! Please put out the cartoon series on DVD!!!"
3,Dimwitted Homour,"Ah, The Tick. What a super super-hero. If only he had a brain. I love this show. Some of the earlier episodes are a bit lame, but there are certainly moments when the show is the gem it should be. The final episode (as most finals seem to be - esp. of short seasons) is the crowning jewel."
5,Should NOT have been taken off the air,BEST SHOW EVER! Patrick Warburton is hilariously silly...(way better than the simpsons...)
3,Where's the Animated Tick?,"Why did they release the live action show, which was killed after 8 episodes, but not the cartoon which did well for 3 seasons? Why do people feel that live action is better than animated? The cartoon trumps the live action show easily. Put the animated show on DVD, and start making new episodes...or somebody is going to get hurt!"
4,Dry humor,"Very much an adult type comedy, Patrick Warburton is funny and prefect for the role he plays in this series!"
3,Please release the animated series on DVD,"Seriously, why would they release the live action show but not the animated series. The live action series pales in comparison the animated series.Fox executives, listen up, release the animated DVD if you want to see signficant sales. I would also recommend running re-runs of the old series on prime time to advertise the animated series. It was probabaly one of the funniest cartoons of all time. However this was more of an adult cartoon and would have done better in prime time than Saturday morning."
3,Animation People!!!,"Am I alone in saying, ""Who cares about the live-action series?"" I mean, it's an ok series, but it pales in comparison to the cartoon version. So while I might buy this simply to fill in my need for some sort of Tick related show, it's just a inferior product. Why won't FOX release the animated show? I mean, really, does anyone think that Firefly was a better show than The Tick?!"
5,He's big. He's blue. What more do you need?,"I first came across the Tick (in his animated form) around two in the morning during a sleepless night quite a few years ago. Instantly I fell in love with the big blue lug, along with his crime-fighting partner Arthur. Later on, I invested in quite a few Tick comic books. When the live-action show began producation, I was ecstatic. At first, I was somewhat worried about real people portraying my heroes, however when the pilot aired on FOX, all my fears turned out to be unfounded. The live action still maintains the irreverance and wit of the comic books and the cartoon series. The only way this show disapoints is in the limited number of episodes. FOX never gave it a chance. At least now the Tick can be enjoyed on DVD. All that is needed now is the cartoon series on DVD."
2,The Tick - poorly done.,"Really poor quality. Obviously copied from a TV set. This may be the only way to purchase the series, but be aware that it's a low grade recording. For Tick fans this will be acceptable."
2,Definitely NOT the cartoon version...,"I don't know why, but the cartoon version was just about the funniest show I had ever seen, but for some reason it didn't transfer well into live-action. The comedy was flat and the Tick mostly came across silly. Bat-Manuel sp? was the only character that seemed to elicit a chuckle. I was suprised at how unfunny this series was considering Patrick Warburton was tailor made for the Tick. I loved him as Cronk in ""The Emperor's Groove"" which was essentially the same dumb loveable character. If you haven't bought this DVD yet, I'd hold out for the cartoon release."
2,"""Seinfeld"" in tights","I watched the 1st 5 of the episodes and the pilot ep was great because both Barry Sonnenfeld (producer) was the director as well and Ben Edlund (creator) was the writer and was a new and equally funny take on the Tick's introduction to the City--after that, ex-""Seinfeld""-ians took control, hence my review title--if you have to buy this DVD set, it would only be for the 1st/pilot ep as the others are not as funny as--yes, the comic book and cartoon--I know it was supposed to be different but that is the problem: how can you have a show, even a spoof of super-heroes, without eventually showing superheroics, etc., with little to no budget! Of course, I'm going to end this with my bottom line complaint: WHY RELEASE THE LIVE-ACTION SHOW BEFORE THE CARTOON! RELEASE THE LATTER ON DVD--NOW! SPOOOOOOOON!"
2,Not Really,"A bit too 'cutesy' and the plotline seemed too obviously manipulated around the author's desired direction of the romance. I found it hard to sympathise with any of the characters as they were rather 2-dimensional and had no real depth or personality at all. I found myself getting a bit annoyed with the 'little quirks' that were introduced. A few mysteries and revelations kept things going however - I wouldn't have minded a bit more focus on that. I got book 3 at the same time as this one, but I don't think I can be bothered to read it."
5,Wonderful and Engrossing,"I was fortunate enough to read both books in a row. I loved both of them - especially this one. I found the characters very engaging, especially the Drapsk, and the story fascinating and almost believable. I am a recent convert to Science Fiction, and still need a story that is engrossing and moving. I also found the wry humor a definite plus.I sure do hope there is another book coming in this series, and soon."
4,The longing for love,"Our character spends his short life longing for a women he cannot have. For a life he so strongly dreams. All for not. His duties require his attention be paid to a chosen life of remorse and hate. Until, as a hero of war, he decides to give up his pursuit. Mr. Maugham once again delivers a well written book. Descriptive, poetic, and interesting. Three adjectives that make a book worth reading."
4,Nice Short Novel,"If you are a fan of his work, I am, then you will surely like this. It was a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon. And you can't beat the price :)"
3,Just OK,"Intelligent characterizations, but a too static a plot. Not as good as his later work. (Review is five words short)."
3,"Good, but flawed","I enjoy most anything written by the pilots that actually flew the aircraft. However, poor editing and mistakes that could be avoided with better research are a distraction that I see fairly often in many books. This book has some good content, but as some other reviewers have pointed out, there are mistakes. Some reviewers mentioned mistakes in the F-80 section whereby a photo of F-104 engine work is mislabelled as F-80s. I'd add that the photo of the F-80 cockpit instrument panel is also from an F-104. The photo of an F-80 captioned ""maintenance men assemble the rocket mechanism of an F-80 before a test flight"" is a puzzle. The exposed engine is clearly a jet engine. The A-7 Corsair is incorrectly called a ""Crusader""...very sloppy."
5,A must have for blow drying and straightening!,Does not weight down hair. Very small amount needed for results--makes product last! Super soft hair after drying and straightening.
1,How dare you Mick Jones!,"To call this band Foreigner is a joke! This is Mick Jones with a bunch of other guys, this is NOT Foreigner!Be a man Mick and call it what it is, The Mick Jones Solo Band."
2,Foul,"While the DVD itself is great, I don't care for the new lead singer -- both in his sound, and in his language. There should be a warning on the advertisements for this DVD because of the language. I'm glad I previewed it without the family around. I'd like my money back on this one."
3,good concert,"it is a good concent, with a very fine selection of Foreigner's hits, with a great performance of Mick Jones and specially of Jason Bonham at the drums, it is not the original and complete band of the 80's , but it is great the hear them rock again."
2,Very average. I expected more.,"The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is because it's slightly better then that junk Foreigner 25. I'm a big fan, but can't give this one any love."
5,FOREIGNER REALLY ROCKS - Must Own DVD & Must See Live,"""Alive & Rockin"" is EXACTLY what FOREIGNER is, and this DVD is just one example of the band's musical range, steller performances and songs that are always ""in"" because they are true rock classics.I was very lucky to be able to see them live and meet them on thier New Years Eve 2007 tour. They were AWESOME!If you love classic rock, you'll really love JASON BONHAM on drums. He humbly carries the torch and his Dad (Led Zeppelin's legendary drummer John Bonham) is right in Jason's heart.Mick Jones never lost his touch - he jams with fantastic guitar & keyboard talent. This DVD will bring back memories and the band today will definitely make it easy to create new ones.OUTSTANDING ROCK - 10 STARS!"
5,The mystery that is Venice,"This is more than a travel guide, though it performs admirably in that department. This Fodor's version presents a lively, colorful journey through this most enigmatic of cities, hitting all of the high points, but even better, focusing as well on the lesser known but still beautiful areas. Wonderful photos, descriptions, historical detail, and literary quotes make this fun to read before, during and after a trip to La Serenissima."
4,Going to Venice? Get this book,"If you're looking for a meat-and-potatoes, just-the-facts-ma'am, where-to-go and what-to-do list, this volume is not what you need.On the other hand, if you'd like the aforementioned as well as history, stories, and photographs, buy this book now!This is one of those travel books that you'll find yourself reading in your spare time on holiday, because there are so many interesting facts, asides, quotes, and anecdotes.The photos are gorgeous and the descriptions are compelling. An overall fun read.Why four stars instead of five?1. It's heavy, with sturdy, glossy pages, and not pocket-sized, so it makes it less desirable to carry around all day.2. This edition came before the switch to the Euro, so all details about prices are five years old, and in lira."
2,Unimpressed,"Sadly, this promising-looking sponge left streaks and marks on all surfaces I tried -- our television, my laptop and our glass patio door. If it had worked it would be nice because it is easy to store and easy to hold. But it just isn't delivering the results promised by the package."
2,+ 1/2 star=: a warm-up to the missing 2nd CD?,"Where is the second disc? The 2nd CD on the European release was supposed to have picked up more steam, be more current and electro, and make great use of DM's ""Personal Jesus"". Wha' happened? Copyright use in the states?Regardless, most of these tracks get little mileage, maybe because some are outdated or just too middle of the road. Legowelt's great ""2002"" feels out of place. The remix of Ladytron's ""Seventeen"" is 90's trance bland. Track 6 starts to pick up the pace. I hate giving a bad review, especially to an artist I love. This is a decent CD that simmers, but unfortunately never boils over. Here's to hoping I can spend my other $15 on the second half!"
5,Best Albeniz,"I am in agreement with the reviews which ascribe to Mr. Russell the superior technique and to Mr Vieaux the superior interpretation of Albeniz. (At these heights of musical accomplishment, it seems hubristic to dare compare.) So, I add nothing in this regard.What I do wish to mention is that the liner notes specifically state that reverb is not used in the production process. The recording was done in a cathedral with what the notes refer to as 'dual source recording.' The result, in all respects is remarkably effective.Albeniz seems to me made for the guitar. These guitar transcriptions transcend the original piano compositions."
2,much cheaper at Depot,"You can get the same one at any Home Depot for $10 less! and Depot ships free after $45, but three for $45 for the price of two here . . . or anywhere for that matter. Sears $52 each, are you kidding me?"
2,Overpriced: got it for $16 at Home Depot,"I'm used to finding products cheaper on Amazon, but this one is a major exception. Just bought this item at Home Depot and came here to find it marked WAY up over their price. $15.97 at Home Depot vs. $27.90?!?!?"
2,Product Description is Incorrect,"I was careful to make sure that the shaft diameter was listed as 1/2"", but the item I received had a shaft diameter of only 3/8"". I could have purchased another brand of a similar item for much less. I thought I was paying a little more for something more robust, so I was left disappointed. In fact, I purchased another nearly identical item made by Goldblatt on the same order, and the same thing occurred with it--the product description clearly states the shaft being 1/2"" diameter, but it turned out to be slightly over 3/8""."
3,Explosion without Fireworks,"The author is a recluse living in a quiet village, and is blown up while chopping wood. With the second murder and its accompanying alibis, and a rather gruesome and sensationalistic third murder, the plot becomes extremely baffling. Plenty of ingenious complications keep the reader interested in the plot and hesitating between three good suspects, and the book benefits from the absence of fat: none of those apt-to-become-tedious speculative sessions with Priestley, who contributes very little. Where the book fails is in the solution: Waghorn pulls the solution out of a hat, with none of those pyrotechnic mental fireworks we expect from Priestley, but fireworks of a very different kind. For this reason, the solution is rather thrillerish, and unconvincing: indeed, rather artificial, and a disappointing ending for what began as a good tangle."
1,Don't Buy,This is the forth ear plug for my nokia that I have had (so I can contrast quality). The audio fidelity was lousy. I could hear but the audio was so distorted that I could not tell what people were saying. I used it for a week - and then bought a replacement locally.
5,Tufo s3 lite,"This is a great all around racing and training tire. It is light enough for triathlon races, yet durable enough for every day use. I've tried Continentals and Hutchinsons, and these are more puncture resistant and longer wearing, and lighter than most racing tires."
3,Nice,"If you want to know where a movie was shot, you will find it's location in this book. Mostly b/w on the inside (with a few exeptions), bit of a shame.It lists a movie, followed by the locations (much like a dictionary).Some big movies are missing (like Rambo: first blood).This might all sound negative, but it is a very nice book."
5,Very satisfied,"Having had several other walkmans, I was extremely pleased with all of the features on this particular product. I especially like the more compact size, the extended battery life, and I've found the preset tuning easy to set and simple to use. I enjoy the TV tuning as an added bonus."
4,"Good performer, not astounding but nice for what it is","As an inexpensive multiband Walkman this unit is quite nice. Its performance is good on FM and TV, but DO NOT buy this if you want a sensitive AM radio. It does OK with local stations, but is not for the AM DX enthusiast. The tuning is nice with an easy choice of next-step or next-channel. The memories are also straightfoward and a nice convenience. The unit came with surprisingly nice headphones."
5,The Literary Fantastic According to the Master Himself,"The stories collected in this volume span through some several hundred years and many languages. The authors represented wrote not only in the genre of the fantastic, they are recognized masters. But here we find their finest, eeriest, most bizarre and phantasmagoric tales. Reading through the book provides a real sense of the development of the ghost story and the fantasy through the years.Perhaps of even greater importance, for those of us who are Calvino fans, we can see what stories the Italian fabulist cherished most, what he read and what influenced him. He places each book in a historical and literary context, and the opening essay is truly key to understanding Calvino's theories of the fantastic, which in themselves make this book worth buying!"
3,Hoping to be swept away...,"I was instead disappointed. I enjoyed Italo's Italian Folktakes so much that I thought this would be another endless read. Instead, I found it dry and methodical. While some of the stories were intriguing, the majority were immature works created by talented authors. Meaning, many of the stories just didn't have the direction, plot, or moral I expect from a ""fantastic tale."""
1,BLAH!!!,Bought it to entertain the grandaughters. Worked for about 10 minutes and then we all lost interest and went into a coma. It's in the landfill by now!
4,great dance and romance movie,"great old movie, that makes one want to get up and dance Latin. Sexy and romantic, the main characters entree you from a princess and a pretty boy. great music and with characters that you will be rooting for, fun to watch. try it out."
5,PASSION PLUS+,"I LOVE this movie. The songs are so sultry. The dancing is so full of passion. When you watch this it puts you in THE MOOD-for real. If you want to jumpstart your relationship, watch this movie!! The music makes you want to dance which in my case led to more.. Does anyone know how to get this soundtrack???"
1,Absurdity,"Aside from how attractive I personally find the lead actress, this movie is a complete and utter waste of time. Period."
3,cheesy but fun!!,This movie is not a big budget movie. It is a little chessy but fun to watch. It has dancing and romace.
3,The Real Message Behind the Movie itself...,"""SAVE OUR RAINFORESTS"" by shaking your assets. LOL!For the better part of this film. I thought the movie was great at the time, because the woman was SO hot! Today, I personally think, there are other smarter ways to get the message across about saving not only our rainforests, but saving our whole planet and conserving our natural resources or what's left of it.Peace up y' all!"
2,simply put...bad,"ummmm.... if u watch this movie ur wasting ur time, so please put away the movie and step away from the tv and its remote. While the dancing is extremly hot, the acting it's polar opposite."
2,BORING,The flick was pretty much almost a dancing flimsy disguised as a movie with an enviromental message.I expected something a with a little more substance but hey it's a musical drama and they're not characterized by having substance.
1,Entirely forgettable,"I was quite prepared to accept that the movie was going to be, as it were, void dramatically -- it's a musical after all, one can always fast forward over drivel to the dancing and music. Unfortunately, there's nothing to fast forward to here: the dancing is very inauthentic, lame; the music even more so (in fact, it isn't even latin by the most part; and as to The Song that started it all, well, a couple of fragments of a bland rip-off of the real thing is all you're going to hear).Guilherme Pimentel of Rio de Janeiro (""Give me a break"" review below) is exactly right -- this flick is very, very lame; don't waste your time."
3,cool,Cool movie. I really enjoyed the drama and the entertainment. I highly recommend this movie to any lovers out there
4,Back in the dayz,I always remember watching this as a kid and now Im glad to have refreshed my memory!!! I loved it!!
3,Lambada,Bought this as a gift. The recipient seemed to like it. I watched it and wasn't as impressed as she was.
3,lambada,"Unfortunately I can only give this movie 3 stars for the following reasons:1. Weak Story line.2. Poor acting by most of the cast.3. However, for some reason they capture you. The dancing is ok.4. What really draws me to this movie is the music. Kid Creole and the Coconuts are wonderful and Corey's lead vocal on the title song kicks it up another notch."
3,"Campy, but fun","We bought the video so we could study the dance style in the movie. We found it quite intriguing and sexy. The plot line was definitely very 80's and quite corny, but the dancing was fabulous most of the time. It was a little off rhythm at times, but we got the idea and we're working on it!"
3,Great for Entertainment,"This movie brings back alot of memories, it is about this Tribe princess whos tribe is being recked by some international deforestation company, she goes to the USA knowing nothing of the real life and faces many concesquences. I remember watching this movie when I was little, I will purchase it, but just to entertain not because it is a classic."
2,Give me a break!,"This is a bad movie, with a bad direction, bad actors (at least in this movie), bad story and belive me, this is not lambada (some musics are, but the dance is not)And for the reviewer below, you must start knowing REAL women 'cause Laura is NOT sensual, she's completely ridiculous (in this movie)..."
2,yuck,"that is about all I can say about this. I was intrigued to buy this because I couldn't find any reviews. The cover has Jack, Mark Long, and Lee I Min all over it. The pictures are from Unbeaten 28 and 7 grandmasters. Well, with Lung Fei's name all over this box, I was hoping I wasn't buying a movie I already had. Nope, this one is just like the back of the dvd says, Lee I min vs. Lung Fei. And while Lee I min was ok in this, I thought it was one of his worst performances. On the other hand, I thought this one of lung fei's better showings. Add in another kid with a stupid hair do, and you have an alright action movie. But then the story is oh so dreadful, this is defintely in my big pile of crap that will be sold at the used store here pretty soon.the picture quality is bad and is full screened. A coupel of times teh vhs tape they were recording from completely flutters out. Enjoy."
4,A very interesting book,"Davidson and Lytle's book is an interesting book about history and the importance of looking at history from different views. They have various historical articles that challenge your beliefs about various historical events and I found that I learned a great deal about history that I had never considered before I read this book. It was required reading in my Historiography class and it will be a book that I will use for years to come when I need to be reminded of how history is written, the biases that are in all of us in our approach to history and the various aspects of history that we rarely, if ever even consider."
3,Cute Story - Too much for a Toddler,"This is a cute story, but better targeted at the 5+ set. It's a longer story and takes a bit more attention and understanding than my 3.5 year old has at this point. I think it'll be a story we reread when she gets a bit older. Very nice illustrations. I bought this since WE LOVE the Fancy Nancy books, but this book is not at the same reading level nor same type of book as Fancy Nancy."
5,very clever & original,"This clever and delightfully-illustrated book is a series of letters between Bettina, a young girl at summer camp Oogie-Waaa-Waa, and her nutty Aunt Tallulah, an eccentric and curious woman who lives with her PhD husband first in Antarctica and later in the Amazon. Aunt Tallulah keeps busy in Antarctica knitting six-fingered gloves and backpack-sized hats, and sends them to Bettina at summer camp. Bettina reciprocates by sending her aunt and uncle floaties made out of pine cones.The book is fun & silly, but it also teaches about the importance of gracious gift giving and receiving -- Bettina's letters are all thank you notes -- and there are all sorts of educational tidbits thrown in -- about Antarctica, polar bears, the Amazon and the like.I think this book is a little too complicated for a toddler, and would expect that it is best suited for a 6 - 9 year old, particularly someone who had an understanding of what camp is all about. It's cute, clever & nicely done."
2,Not bad - doesn't fit shaped skis,"I just fitted this to my 998xt rack. It fits fairly well, and feels pretty secure. It's well made, and comes with all the accessories you'll need.The downside is that it's impossible to get my shaped skis (Rossi Bandit B3s) into the rack the way they suggest (back to back). They do fit, but less securely, as individual skis. This reduces the capacity to 3 pairs of skis, and not 6.Also the height of the rack, even with my relatively short skis, is insane - the tops of the skis stand a good 2 feet above the roofline of my SUV.To be honest.... I wish I'd bought a roof rack, and just stuck with the Thule rack for my bike."
4,definatly not a picture book,"I found this book to be very helpful in getting you to think of the box. Instead of being like a picture book with not much information, it tells you how to come up with ideas and explains the process of making a good design. This is a great book to have if you already have those picture books with just designs and need something to help you with actually creating your own designs."
4,A real world book,"Unlike design books filled w/ eye-candy & no direction on processes, Mark Oldach steers the reader through well defined concepts & thoughts. An excellent book for all designers who wish to communicate through design."
3,Design basics,I like the book it helped me understand what it takes to be a graphic designer. Great Book for those looking into Graphic Design as a career.
5,CH HANSON 345EK A-SQUARE FOLDING LAYOUT TRIANGLE,"I have found that this product is of exceptional use in the tile laying industry. It guarantees you that perfect pattern that not only you want to acquire, but what the customer requires. A definite 5 star quality."
3,"Usefull, but a little flimsy.","I bought this A-Square to use in floor tile layout. I saw it used in a trade magazine and it looked like a time saver. It saves time over squaring out a 3-4-5 triangle on the floor using your tape mesure - definately! But for the price I was a little dissapointed in the thinness of the aluminum parts making it not very rigid unless fully supported on the floor. Also the little locking button that locks the triangle into place bumps out proud so that you cant really lay it down flat on the floor in one direction without chance of depressing the locking button and possibly unlocking the triangle out of square. Good for general layout but dont expect tolerances greater than 1/32"" over 3 feet."
3,Supplanted by laser tools?,"Based on the strong recommendation in the Meehan tile book, I bought one of these to layout a small bathroom floor about 6 x 9. It was marginally helpful though I might have realized more benefit on a larger job.A generally neat tool, with a brilliant but flawed design: it does not lie flat! This simply isn't possible as-is, and if you are trying to make long, accurate markings, forget it as you approach the corners. If it would lay flat, this would be a 4 to 5 star tool. Now that laser tools are becoming so cheap, I would save your cash and buy a good one of those to mark your perpendicular lines.Overall the tool is extremely solid and well built; no complaints there. I did not find any problem with the right triangle (not 45-triangle) design as did some reviewers and the long shipping tube case from Amazon was great. The 12"" plastic A-square included as a bonus is cool but irrelevant if you already own a 12"" speed square."
5,"What's that formula? 3, 4,5? Just get the big triangle already!",Just a neat tool! Takes all the guess work out. I like this one compared to a competitors because it doesn't have a pivot point in the hypotenuse of the triangle. Everything turns out straight and true. Well built but does flex a little bit. Nothing that worries me though. If it was built out of heavier gauge aluminum I would be complaining that it weighed to much then. Take the time to take care of it and it should last a lifetime. Go build something!
3,Not too expensive,"Works fine but shop around. I assumed amazon had a competive price but I saw it at the local hardware OSH for 44.99 plus tax. I already placed the order so I will be out several dollars plus waiting for delivery.Jan. 30 2007 I judged too quickly, the delivery was super fast, the package tube was bullet proof, and a bonus 45 degree folding triangle was included. I will use the shipping tube as a carrying case and the bonus triangle combined makes this a competive package with the above mentioned lower price. This is a four star package maybe five if the price was a little lower."
3,It's Okay,"I like the concept and the quality... I know some reviewers complained about it being a bit flimsy, but I've had it for several years now and never had a problem... It actually contributes to it being lightweight and easy to handle... What I don't like (again as some other reviewers have pointed out) is that it doesnt lay flat because of the locking button... I wish I had noticed that before I bought it cause I probably would have opted against it... Its still good for checking square, but I also wanted to scribe lines with it while it was laying ""flat"" on the floor..."
4,Simple and Interesting,"I first saw this discussed in an issue of Handyman magazine and thought it might be interesting to try out someday. Time passed, I recalled this, and ordered one. First it arrived not only in a cardboard tube....but with a large box taped onto one end making for a very irregular package. I'm sure the delivery person was confused. I think this will be a nice addition/backup to my laser alignment tools. I am starting a project where I can test this out. I will update as I get more info.PLEASE NOTE: If this arrives in the same packaging; check through all the packing in the box as there was a small bag of extra parts that I did not see at first and almost threw away."
5,Works Perfectly,This product worked perfectly with my Zire 72 for which I have no wall charger. Perfect for synching and charging. It arrived before the estimated date so I am very pleased and would purchase from them again anytime!!
5,Good Christian Movie,My 2 1/2 year old and I discovered the Hermie and Friends movies recently. He absolutely loves them and watches them over and over. They are probably his favorite DVDs of all. The movies are very cute and clever. We enjoy the Christian values that these movies teach. I find myself watching them with him too. We have seen four of the Hermie & Friends movies and Buzby is one of his favorites. We highly recommend these movies!!
5,funny and useful,"I think that Max Lucado's hermie and Friends movies are really well done, as they give simple and useful messages. my boy would look at those cartoons thousand time and I'm sure he will remember about the advises of God when He will need them, and he will also remember to remain on the streith path as God tells him. I advise to by this dvd as it is nice to wathch it with all the family."
5,Great DVD!,"Buzby is very funny! I highly recommend this series to anyone with children. My kids LOVE Hermie & Friends, and I really like the content. You should definitely give this series a try- we like it even better than Veggie Tales. :)"
5,My son has fallen under the Hermie/Buzby spell....,"I don't know exactly what it is, but my 2 year old son is mesmerized by this DVD. Both the short (""Follow the straight path"") and the movie (""Buzby, King of the Bees, K-I-N-G King!"") He watches it over and over. This is the only thing he will actually sit through completely. He wants to watch it every night, ""Watch Buzby, Hermie?! Yay!!"" and winds down for bedtime watching it. He won't fall asleep to this one, but he doesn't leave the pillow while it is on. It is very cute, and you have to love the fact that Don Knotts has lended his voice. Good lessons, cute characters (how could you not love an Elvis-impersonating Bee?)."
1,Marvin Gaye Through The Grapevine CD,This CD is of very low audio quality and a big disappointment. If you enjoy Marvin Gaye try this one.. 18 Greatest hits... http://www.amazon.co.uk/18-Greatest-Hits-Marvin-Gaye/dp/B000057CNF/ref=sr_1_4?s=music&ie=UTF8&qid=1327160196&sr=1-4 ...It's much better and not recorded (very poorly) Live.
5,Fantastic Material,"I Really Enjoyed The Genius Of Marvin Gaye.His Material Never Lets Up.As a Writer,Producer,Musician&Vocalist Marvin Gaye Really Shines Here.Timeless material Here Very Essential."
3,Did not work for me.,"I ordered this as a weight loss supplement as per an article I read in a health magazine. Although I had to quit taking it within a few days because it made me have terribly difficult bathrooming sessions. Something that has never happened to me before. And I also struggled with a little bit of depression while taking it. I did like the fact that it came in tablet form rather than gelatin capsules and so forth. But I do suggest being careful with this supplement, I think the brand itself is a good one. But I just couldn't handle it."
5,It Works!,"Every 25 hours, I recomend using this product. It can be rewound and used 3 times I believe. Lasts me for years. I use on Camcorders as well as Mini-DV, Player-Recorder. Assures you of clean heads using the dry tape cleaning formula. Takes seconds to work!"
5,Hard to find.,Couldn't find this item any where. Found it at Amazon. Used it on the same day I got it. Has already paid for it self. Would recommend to others.
2,confused,The delivery was great and on time but when I follow the instructions on the tape nothing happens! It's supposed to be as simple as inserting the tape and pressing play...wouldn't buy again unless someone can help troubleshoot this problem???
4,Does what I bought it to do,Nothing special to report on here! It does what it is intended to do. Yes I would buy again. I use this on my Panasonic DVX100B
3,it's just ok,"Well, the product did its job. However, it took way longer time to make affect. It advertised that you only need 10 seconds to clean up the video head. I tried to do that for 2 times but it didn't work until I decided to leave a full 1 minute, and it worked at last.For such a price, this is a okay product!"
4,DVC head cleaner,Purchased on advice of Panasonic rep to fix video camera. Didn't fix camera but assume it at least cleaned the head for whenever camera is fixed.
4,10 seconds makes a difference.,"I used this cleaning tape in a camcorder that has been in storage for over 5 years and after running the cleaning tape for 10 seconds, my camcorder now works perfectly."
4,One of my toddler's favourites,"We got this as a gift. It's a really cute book, with fun illustrations and a nice message too. This was the first 'longer' book my daughter wanted to listen to over and over at about 13 months. She is now 17 months and she still chooses to have us read it to her daily. My husband doesn't seem to get too tired of reading it. Will definitely be getting more books from these authors as my daughter seems to appreciate the humour."
2,reading or boring,"I didn't like this book as much as some of the others, although the meaning behind is excellent, it wasn't as enjoyable"
5,AWSOME!!!!!,this cd single is awsome the two other songs on it are live recorings but they sound so awsome. If you like the Moffatts then you have to get this cd
2,USA BASS CHAMP SLEEVED (Jewel Case),"Not worth the money, can't see the fish and all it says is you got one.Very boring, there isn't enough lures to choose from."
1,horrible,"This game is so boring, all you do is ride in a boat and try to catch a fish, no place to actually get a better reel, you can get lures by driving around and finding them but they dont tell you how good they are and then you lose them when you go to the next scene anyway then you have to drive a round and find them again,"
3,Silly but OK,"This a stupid, but cute and entertaining movie with lots of known actors. I enjoyed the movie although I can not really recommend it as good. It is basically a satire of an early b\w movie (war of the worlds I thinnk)."
4,Pretty cool,This movie really wasn't a comedy except for the fact that all the aliens were blasting the guts out of the big screen stars. I dont like the fact that Lukas Haas was became the big star of the movie. Clever. But Micheal J. Fox should have had more screen time.Great cast.Micheal J. FoxPierce BrosnanJoe Don BakerLukas HaasJack NicholsinDanny DevitoTom JonesSarah Jessica ParkerGlenn CloseAnneta BenningMartin Short
4,"Campy, but Essential for any respectable American cult film collection...Blu-ray please!","This title could excel in Blu-ray. With a good remastering, CGI clean-up, Dolby/THX, some good extras & special features, and maybe a documentary about the satire/commentary on society etc, and/or the historical & surreal inspirations for the narrative and visual styling. The box art is also nice minus the actor photos. Not perfect but what good cult film is."
4,Very funny classic retro movie!,"I've always loved this movie, the special effects are incredible and the cast surprised me (I didn't know Jack Black was in this movie until recently). I always liked the way they made the movie very retro looking, since it was based on trading cards from 1960's. If you're into wacky sci-fi comedies, I HIGHLY recommend Mars Attacks! It's a shame there are no extras on this DVD, but the movie is worth getting, especially at under $10."
4,Hooray for Tom Jones!,"This movie has an all star cast and great visuals. There are a lot of sight gags, and the humor is timeless."
4,Great satire!!,"This is one of the best parodies of 1950s and early 60s sci-fi films ever done (not that there are a lot of 'em to begin with). Hardly a cliche is left unturned, a character type skipped and a detail missed. The '90s twist, along with some unspoken political ""commentary,"" makes it even more enjoyable. And the ending is a riot! A movie that actually improves with each viewing."
1,One star for one chuckle.,I chuckled over what causes the demise of the Martians. Everything else is so over the top that it's simply not funny.
1,YOU GOTTA BE JOKING.,First of all how can cast like this star in a movie like this espically Jack Nichollson you let me down on this movie you were just in it for the money. If i was president of the united states id rather commit suicide than starring in this movie. AND ONE MORE THING? This movie can kiss my a--? see if you can fill in the blank
1,It Sucks!,"When this Movie was released on Videocassette I was more than anxious to see it.The casting alone was enough to get my couriosity and expectations up.The hype about it was also pretty encouraging so I purchased theTape... ...Boy was I apauled at this film!When I realized that I had wasted my money on this ""Bomb"" I wove out a tapestry of obscenities that as far as we know still hangs in space over the Rocky Mountain region!"
1,Waste of time!,"When I first saw this movie in the theater I enjoyed it. I was pretty anxious to get it on video and I did but it turned out to be a crummy movie! Yes, it does have good acting, good music by Danny Elfman, and a great all-star cast. But what else can I say this movie is pretty much dumb and it does make fun of Independence Day and Close Encounters of the Third Kind but that's not the reason why I don't like it. The reason why I don't like it is because it's cheesy, boring, and dumb. I am going to throw away my Mars Attacks video because it's stupid. I have no reason to put it in my movie collection. So whatever you do if you hadn't seen this movie yet, please do not rent it. You might be a little disappointed. It may be enjoyable for little kids but not adults. Adults might find it boring. Thanks for reading!- Ryan"
1,Horrible,"This movie was a horrible display of everything. and I KNOW that the special effects and the plot were supposed to be campy but THE MOVIE SUCKED!!!! it was a pathetic excuse for a movie. I subjected myself to this torture not once, but twice and i still didn't find it funny!"
3,Mars Attacks my funnybone,"I ordered the CD for my daughter, we watched it and had a hilarious time, since watching it we've seen it over and over again."
2,"Burton's done much, much better","Neato special effects and some funny moments, but overall a disappointment. I came away from this film with only one thing on my mind: ""What's the point????"""
2,intriguing look at Bad Blockbusters,Tim Burton proves he is capable of making a spoof movie. But Burton misses the comedic part of the movie.. If you are a fan of any big name star you will find them in this movie either overacting or just in for a quickiee.... Money could be better spent elsewhere!
5,One of the best sci-fi movies of all time!!!,I just bought this movie on blu-ray and it looks fantastic.. Loads of stars and unreal special effects.. A great movie...
5,Timeless fun,My VHS version of this film has finally died and I'm buying a DVD version. It will reside in a place of honor next to my Bubba Ho-tep DVD and other classics. Every few years I can get a good laugh all over again. Good stuff -
4,Bizarre and Funny,"Are you tired of cookie-cutter comedies? Looking for something different, outrageously funny, and filled with top-notch acting? Mars Attacks is the movie that you are looking for. The superb star-studded cast is just the icing on the cake of this hilarious spoof of sci-fi B-movies."
1,Save Yourself !!,"I went to this with my wife, and as we left I told her, "" I'm sorry. I owe you THREE Chick flicks."" It was that bad. I have to list this as ( Honestly ! ) the worst movie I've ever seen. I loved the farts in ""Blazing Saddles"", but this movie really, really is BAD. - Chuck"
1,Zero Stars,"WORSTMOVIEEVER!Not a single laugh or other redeeming feature. A total waste of life. I can't imagine that anyone ever had to pay money to see this POS. If it weren't offered on Amazon for free (Prime Instant Video), I'd be demanding my money back. If you don't have Prime Instant Video, don't waste your money. If you do have it, then don't waste your time."
1,"""Independence Day"" if everybody had been a total moron","There are certain things out there you simply cannot make humorous; one of them is the destruction of Earth, Douglas Adams notwithstanding.If there was ever a movie that needed a ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" smart-aleck commentary overlay, this is it. Nobody is worth rooting for, not the kid who thinks the Martians are making ""the international sign of the doughnut"" in their initial broadcast to Earth and thinks we should all live in teepees, not the trigger-happy general who gets shrunken by the Martians and then stepped on, not even the senile grandmother who accidentally discovers that Slim Whitman music causes the Martians' heads to explode. For a film that's supposedly set in the late 1990s, the military equipment featured is from the 1950s. It's a classic example of what James Blish called the Idiot Plot, and would slap you in the face repeatedly while you watch it if it could."
2,"Bizarre, mean-spirited outing not worth watching even once.","The title sums it up. Not a movie worth watching. Some interesting concepts, but overall a coked-up, mean-spirited waste of time and effort. Do yourself a favor and buy a copy of Terry Gilliam's ""Time Bandits"" or ""Baron Munchausen"" instead, you know, an actual film that's worth watching.Movies like ""Mars Attacks"" makes me want to see laws passed to drug test every director, producer and editor on this planet. Evil, unfunny crap. There's an undercurrent of lowbrow meanness that can't be ignored. Really a rotten film."
5,A fun watch,"You can't go wrong with Tim Burton. This is a mindless fun-filled flick. Total camp. Well filmed. Good acting. And good special effects for 1997. And for those of you who don't remember, this movie is based on bubble gum trading cards of the '60's, so it's kind of nostalgic too. Enjoy."
5,Great cast in the movie... Funny,"The movie is funny for the most part... Guess you have to have an open mind and 'what if' I was in this type of situation? Besides that, it answers what a lot of people weren't sure of... Do martians really have green blood? :) Enjoy the movie for what it is, entertainment!"
5,Great Movie,I use to watch this movie with my little brother and sister. I enjoy this movie so much. It is funny with great animation. This is a must see movie.
3,mars attacks-an all star cast,"well theres not much of a story.mars attacks.stars are many.jack nicholson is the president.christina applegate is a rednecks ol lady.is that wyona ryder?maybe not.danny devito plays a gambler.wayne newton as well wayne newton.the kids can watch it,but it could freak out the real little ones.tim burton directs this one so it is great as usual.it is one of his best films.there are many creative ideas and imagination galore all throughout this one.the aliens are abselutely hysterical.christina applegate is in it but only for a second.then theres this chick who cheats on michael j fox with pierce brosnan.is this guy always stealing someones woman on his movies?anyway,shes tacky.the hippie chick in it is hot but very deeply emotionaly disturbed.this is a really funny movie and everyone but jack nicholsons personal best.the special effects are not fantastic but the ideas that go into them are very creative."
3,Hollywood politics,"I had the cards when I was a kid (they left out the giant insects, one of the best parts of the card series) They used big movie stars to no avail, in fact they got in the way. I think Jack N. is one of the best, but he had that awful run-on scene where he is trying to convince the Martian leader, pathetic, was Tim Burton trying to squeeze water from a stone. In my opinion, Tim Burton's earlier work is great but this was an over indulgent miss. Power corrupts! I liked the movie, but it could have been so much better. Will movie history prove me wrong? No! Look at the overall score, 3 and 1/3 stars, that's about right."
4,"Come on, people","Yes, it's true - the story in Mars Attacks! is a bit far-fetched and it often seems very cheesy, but it's like that ON PURPOSE. A big part of this movie is a satire of cheesy ""little green men from space"" movies (such as Plan 9 From Outer Space). Tim Burton once again shows that he is one of the best directors around, lending this film a style totally unique and still totally Burton. The performances, for what they are, are good and the movie is quite funny. The special effects are done perfectly - yeah the aliens look like they're made of rubber, just how they should. If you take this movie for what it is and don't expect a masterpiece of cinema (although it is a triumph of style, direction, production, and art direction as all of Tim Burton's movies are) then you'll find a great little movie here."
2,An irritating movie.,"The special effects are o.k., but that's about the only good thing to be said about this overrated piece of junk. It's an annoying and irritating mess, filled with actors who think they're having fun, when in reality they dislike the material. It if weren't for Burton or the big budget, would they care ?. -Ofcourse not. It does however feature two of my favorite actors; Joseph Maher and Sylvia Sidney. The great Maher is wasted in yet another nothing-part, but Sidney is marvellous as Grandma. There's really not much else to recommend it, I'm afraid."
2,A WAY FOR ACTORS TO MAKE SOME MONEY,"Unenthusiastic performances by Nicholson and all others involved, it must have just been a way pick up a few easy bucks for them.Not intended to be, but still ugly monsters, over used in this so called parody of sci fi films.Bad editing, awful screen play, bad acting, etc.Forget this one."
2,Not as funny as the trailers,"This film tried for campy humor like Dr. Stranglove, but it fell short, in my opinion. The quality actors in the cast didn't use their talents. The funniest parts of the movie were in the trailers. END"
5,"Great, cool, awesome",good movie. wish I could watch it again.it's about some aliens that come to earth from mars and destroy anything they see.
5,Great,"This is a great movie.It's about Mars atacking Earth.When they land they say they come in peace,yeh right until birds fly down and scare them and they start atacking everything in sight.But they find a way to destroy them."
3,Okay,"This movie was okay, but it didn't have many laughs. It was more of one of those action movies almost because of all the people how die in it. Pretty much the only thing good about the movie is the way the aliens look."
4,"A Weird, Off-Beat, and Clever movie","You either love or hate Mars Attacks! I loved it. I'm a Tim Burton fan, and I like his twisted visions, and strange ideas. I thought Mars Attacks was funny. It's a film you have to see twice to really appreciate it. Trust me."
5,Mars Attacks vs ID4,<MA>Funny <ID4>Over hyped <MA>Well written <ID4>Written by some one who didn't own a watch <MA>Great cast <ID4>Will Smith had to carry the film.All in all this is one of the best alien spoofs films. END
3,You'll have to be in the mood.,"On one level, this is an intelligent comedy, especially in its lampoon of the military, and the executive and legislative branches of the federal government. It's kinda campy, but the scene where Congress is blown up is worth if if you're in the mood for this kind of film."
4,"'What if Tim Burton was One of Us?""","Finally a movie where the heroes die!!!!!!!!!! This movie takes a departure from conventional formulatic plot scemes and does the opposite. I applaud Tim Burton for having the guts to make this film. Who would have ever imagined that Congress, The Prez and The First Lady would all eventually get blown to bits in ONE movie?!? (Yeeah.) Who would have ever imagined rooting for the martians as they kill off the entire human species, sytematically, methodically, dutifully. The martians in this movie are disturbingly frightning but loveable at the same time. This movie pokes fun on how stupid and anal we are as a culture. I bet Tim Burton is just sitting back laughing at all of us."
2,Not that funny,"Hey, it was suppose to be stupid. Only problem, it wasn't that funny. The trailers contained around half the laughs I got out of the movie. END"
4,Pretty Good!!!,"I caught this on tv last night. I'm glad I did because I haven't seen this movie in years, and was a good way to refresh my memory. This is an awesome movie with great special effects and good actors such as Michael J. Fox, Jack Nicholson, Pierce Brosnan, Sarah Jessica Parker, Glenn Close, and many more! I love the way it reminded me of the classic martian films of the 50's, such as The War of the Worlds. Martians visit Earth, claiming to come in peace, but they really came to destroy us and the planet. I also love the black comedy throughout with the Martians having fun, until we take a stand and fight back! I highly recommend MARS ATTACKS!!!"
4,Fun movie for repeated watchings,"Playing video games does help you protect a President!I love this movie:Especially the scene where the giant chases the car, the scene where the kids save the president from martians and Jack Nicholson's hand wringing speech on TV.And Samson's boxing fight."
3,I thought the acting was good but the story was terrible!,The overall acting was quite good but I think the actors were wasted in the film. They could have been doing something better with their time then making this cheesy film. The story line was TERRIBLE!!
2,.,"I'll give it an extra star for Tom Jones' truly amusing role, some good, cartoony effects, and the occasional Burton touch. That said, this is Burton's worst movie. It doesn't know quite what it wants to be, and in the end it isn't much of anything. It's vaguely entertaining on first viewing but after that its almost nauseating to even think about."
1,"Complete, utter, total waste of time","One of the few times in my life I have found nothing to like about a movie. And I have seen some crappy movies. Like a slot-machine junkie, I kept watching, figuring that it had to get better at some point. But no such luck. When it was over, I realized I had completely wasted my time, and that I'm never getting that hour and 45 minutes of my life back. Giving this movie one star is far too generous. Unfortunately, there is no zero star option. Please spend your time more wisely (and save your money). Wash your car. Organize your CD collection. Watch the Home Shopping Network. Paint your toenails. Read a romance novel. Take a nap. ANYTHING would be a better use of your time than to watch this movie."
1,The bottom of the pile.,"This is probably the most humourless, pile of putrid garbage I have ever seen in a movie. I can't believe so many people like this. It is moronic. It was excruciating to have to sit through it. I would rather be bored with nothing to do, in fact I would rather be in the dentist's chair that see this appauling insult to my good taste again. The people who like this are morons with no taste who are easily pleased by anything. This is a definite contender for my ""Worst movies ever"" list. Get a life!!!!"
1,Utterly wretched,"They can't even give this pile of dross away in the 2-99 bargain bucket any more. Why? Because word has got around that it is a complete waste of 100 minutes.Never funny enough to work as comedy and certainly not intelligent enough to work as satire, let alone sci-fi, Mars Attacks fails miserably on all accounts.Cackhanded direction generates not even a wry grin from the very weak and thinly spread visual gags, and the (surprisingly strong) cast appear to be just going through the motions. What on Earth were Nicholson and Close thinking of when they got involved with this turkey?The lowest point in Tim Burton's career."
1,Should've been MST3K fodder......,"Who's crackpot idea was it to make a dumb, science fiction spoof with big stars? Fortunately, I saw this in a drive-in with my parents. We first saw the live action film, ""101 Dalmatians,"" which was awesome. I almost fell asleep watching ""Mars Attacks."" If I saw that in a regular movie theater, I would've walked out and demanded my money back. Why oh why did Mike and the bots overlook this piece of garbage?"
2,Not that good a movie.,"If u don't like intense violence, don't watch this movie. Unlike me, who's watched it, and don't really like it. The humans are shot and burned up, and experiments are done on decapitated people. Also, if u don't like WEIRD movies, then don't watch it, because this one alien in the movie has nitrogen chewing gum. In general, I wouldn't really suggest a movie like this. :("
2,Made to be bad,"A spoof of all those low-budget sci-fi flicks of the fifties and sixties. This was supposed to be a comedy, but I found it to be very grotesque and tasteless instead of funny. A waste of an all-star cast with its plethora of overacting and lousy special effects. It's best to see it on one of those premium cable channels instead of renting or buying the video if you just want to relieve your curiosity."
1,Where's the comedy?,"Mars Attacks has a huge and talented all-star cast, but rarely uses the actors. This film is never really funny although there are a couple of scenes I found laughable such as when the aliens were destroying the cities they keep saying, ""Don't run. We are your friends."" However, that's just about it. This film is certainly no cult classic as it is just about forgotten. I am surprised this film's budget was 70 million dollars. Half of it was probably spent on the underused cast."
5,I liked it and I don't care who knows!,"When I first saw this movie I thought it was so funny! My friends thought it was a stupid movie, but I did not care about them. I liked this because it sort of reminded me of ""Ed Wood"". And as for all you people who hated you did not get the joke! see this movie now!"
1,lame!,"The movie played all right but you couldn't hear the people talking. The dub over had an issue. It always be one of my most favorite movies, but I will still have to buy it again :("
3,"I love the movie, but no sound....","love the movie like I said but it would have been was sound, I tried everything, changed the menu settings, checked all my plugs... nothing, unless I got the only defective one or all of them are the same, it did give me subtitles, but still no sound... so buy at your own risk... The first Defective product I ever got from Amazon."
3,Pretty Good Spoof,THis Film is a Cool Spoof.Tim Burton Does a Trip Out take on 50's Movies here.Alot of Cameos.not Burton's Best but Worth Viewing still for a Laugh.
2,Must have a sense of humour?,"If that is true then I certainly don't have because I thought this movie was simply not funny. Sure there are a couple of amusing moments, but if you throw enough mud some of it is bound to stick! If you saw the trailer then you will have already seen the best moments of the film. I know it's satire and I get the jokes - they're just not funny! If you like spoofs then you'll probably enjoy this, if you don't then steer clear."
3,Not as cool as I remember...,"I saw this movie several years ago, and thought that it was really funny, but after recently buying and re-watching it, I couldn't really remember why I liked it so much. There is lots of quirky humor and unexpected plot turns (like what defeats the Martians), but nothing to celebrate about. I appreciate the fact that it is Tim Burton's, and I also feel that having most of the enormous (and very famous) cast die was a brave thing to do, but the movie as a whole just isn't that spectacular. I suggest renting it before buying it."
4,Some good fun.,"Jack Nicholson, Glenn Close, Annette Bening, Pierce Brosnan, Danny DeVito, Martin Short, Sarah Jessica Parker and Michael J. Fox star in this funny movie. This is the kind of funny and whacky stuff that you can expect from director Tim Burton.The movie's pot is simple. Aliens are invading the earth.This is executed very well with the hilarious looking aliens.When the aliens arrive, a translating machine reads that what the leader said was ""we come in peace"". So, one lady releases a dove in the air which gets vaporised by the beam of one alien. The movie develops very nicely with a resistance by the humans. The movie is just really neat and cool and is also really funny. And for $5.49, this is a gimme. You can buy for 2 dollars more than a rent. This is a movie that I enjoy watching and that's a good addition to my collection."
4,A classic Tim Burton comedy,An excellent comedy that will be around for many years to come as a classic. Everybody should have this in their DVD library.The two characters that I loved were General Decker and General Casey. My guess is they were modeled on Norman Schwartzkopf (the warrior) and Colin Powell (the politician).You will have to watch it several times to catch everything that was crammed into this movie.
3,Independence Day meets Attack of the Killer Tomatoes,"Ack, Ack! Ack, Ack! Ack, Ack!Ok, you've read the other reviews, you know who's in it, and that it's based on trading cards, etc.It's a funny movie, one of those so stupid it's funny kind of movies. Some people like them, some hate them, you know who you are, that should give you a clue as to whether you'll like this movie or not.There are elements from Independence Day and War of the Worlds, the movie that Independence day was based on, as well as others. The final solution comes straight from Attack of the Killer Tomatoes.You'll never think about Slim Whitman the same way again.74s181..."
3,No special features,None at all. Just the movie and the language options. The movie is also in widescreen despite it being a blu-ray disc. It should take the whole screen so it can take advantage of the resolution.
2,There were funnier lines in the movies this was spoofing.,"The Martians' ack-ack was funny. I laughed at them. I didn't laugh at any of the actors. This was hit-you-over-the-head with a rubber chicken humor, not sophisticated or clever humor. If you're going to do a satirical spoof you have to work harder than Burton did here."
3,Okay Sci-Fi Camp,"Given the high-powered cast, a healthy budget and top-notch director,this should have been the sci-fi send-up to end all send-ups. Alas, the film becomes mired in its own self-conscious approach. Nonetheless, there are some very funny moments, and Nicholson (in the character of the casino 'mogul'), Pierce Brosnan as the smug science advisor to the President (also played by Nicholson) and Martin Short as the president's press secretary contribute a lot towards the inanity and goin's on in the film. Sarah Jessica Parker's role as the dull-witted TV personality also shines. If you're looking for a chuckle or two then you'll probably like this okay comedy."
5,Not for the Stupid,"Having spent an hour or so reading every review of this movie on the site, I have come to the conclusion that most of the people who did not like it, were simply not bright enough to ""get it"". Most of the humor in this movie is sophisticated satire and irony. i.e. - you need a brain to understand what the joke is. Unfortunately it seems that that leaves about 70% of the population out in the cold sort of speak.Also, a lot of the reviewers here trash the acting and imply that the big name actors were ""only in it for the money"", yet are unaware of the fact that most of those ""big stars"" clamored to be in this movie at lower pay scales than they are used to. Then they go on about how 2 dimensional or ""broad"" the acting is. Well, ..Duhhh! It's a cartoonish satirical comedy based on a series of bubblegum cards. It's *meant* to be that way.Finaly, a lot of those who hate this movie compare it unfavorably to (their favorites), ID4 or Armageddon or some such trash as that.Nuff said."
3,Great Video...But Sound....,"I truly do love this movie and upgraded to Blu-ray. My only pet-peeve is why cant they get the speaking-sound right? The music is great, but I have to crank up the volume to hear anything when someone speaks. I know they are using Dolby, but honestly.As for the picture -- it's a GREAT transfer. Looks wonderful on Blu-Ray."
4,Mars Attacks DVD,"I figured for less than 6 bucks it would be worth the gamble for this. What I got was basically a copy of the movie. No extras, just the movie. The disc didn't even have anything printed on it.The jewel case at least had the insert with the title and artwork. The good thing is, the DVD played OK and it was cheap. I'm giving it 4 stars because of those two factors plus this movie is a favorite of mine and the usual excellent service I've come to expect from Amazon."
4,Funny Film,I enjoyed this movie. I bought this to replace a broken dvd. If you like parody's of space movies buy this.
4,Funny classic!,I hadn't seen this movie in years. I forgot how many stars were in it. Nicholson is awesome in his dual roles! A young Jack Black appearance is hilarious. This is a forgotten comedy classic.
1,Lack of disclosing info,"No problem with the movie itself including the second version. However, I was not aware it is a subtitled DVD, on BOTH versions no less. This leaves out the option to watch at least the unsubtitled movie. I don't know about anyone else but for me, I find this very distracting & takes away from the whole experience. I was extremely disappointed. If I had known....oh well."
2,Not much to this.,"This is basically a film that can be skipped. There is a funny part or two and some inventive special effects, but that's really about it. There are a lot of popular stars in this movie, but none of them stand out in their roles. I can see how some people could get a kick out of watching this, but overall I didn't find it to be that enjoyable at all. It didn't have much substance to it and just wasn't interesting."
1,No Sound,"I orignally purchased this item along with some other dvds. I have purchased movies from amazon before but this was the first dvd that did not work. You can only hear the background music. No dialogue. I figured that it was a defective dvd and requested a new copy. Amazon was very helpful in the return process. They sent me a replacement dvd right away. Unfortunately, the new dvd had the same problem as the other, no sound. I had send both dvds back and requested a refund. I received my refund in about a week. This has been the only problem that I have had with Amazon. But, they handled my return/refund so well, I continue shopping from them."
1,Silent movie,"The movie arrived and had no sound. Tried different players, computers, dvd players, xbox and playstation 3; yet the movie had no sound."
3,Great while it lasted,"This unit was great for the first year. It has all of the features; magnetic attachment for the cord, ""cooltouch"" exterior, removabe oil pan, dishwasher safe except for electronics. We used it a lot but it now won't heat above 350 degrees. We've checked it with multiple thermometers and it just doesn't heat up anymore.We'll probably replace it with a dutch oven and fry basket."
4,A beautiful coming out story.,"Billy is a typical 16 year old high school sophomore. He's good looking, smart, and on the varsity swim team. So what's his problem? His friends are always trying to fix him up with girls. On the way home from school one day, Billy passes a store front that is being transformed into a political office. His eyes meet those of Al, who is readying the office. He volunteers to help in the campaign and also wants to get to know Al. Al and Billy begin to campaign together. They get to know each other. They also learn that their attraction for each other goes beyond mere friendship. After Billy invites Al to his final swim meet, they return to Al's house to explore these feelings. Al is much more conventional than Billy and is not as willing to be out. Billy cannot understand this and after a weekend at his Aunt's house, finally believes that this relationship will not work out. Billy must deal with these feelings and how they have changed his life."
3,For those who like a complex story line,"If you are one of those people, like myself, who enjoy a complex story line, this is the book for you. The jumping back and forth between times makes for an interesting plot. And the supporting characters could be a little more defined. It seems to fall into the catergory of most gay stories nowa days; Two guys become friends, they find out eachother is gay, they fall in love, a few steamy sex scenes, and then the two guys end up drifting apart. I give this book a 6 out of 10. For a good plot, but the characters and jumping back and forth are a little awkward."
4,Finished in one sitting,"Granted that this is a very short book, it still read remarkably quickly. John Fox paints what appears to be a very clear picture of what life was like for a gay Catholic school teenager in 1968. At the very end of his novella, Fox hints at the horrible danger of being gay in that time, but he mostly highlights the struggle to accept oneself and the blossoming of first love. Though that story line is hackneyed, Fox creates a very, very personal and touching rendition within the historical context of a fascinating and chaotic time. The cover says that Boys on The Rock is a novel, but the work feels non-fictional. Learning more about the life of protagonist Billy Connors in a sequel would be most rewarding."
3,too average,"It was good, but for me the plot line was too much of a classic gay coming of age story. The end really left me hanging. I wanted to know what happened to him after the story. Where did he go to college? Did he ever fall in love again? Other than that though, the book was very well written and constructed. I would recommend reading it if it is your first gay coming of age story. If it isn't though, read something else."
2,Ack! GRAIN!,"I was not at all impressed with this film. I shot eight rolls under various conditions with my Nikon N80 and will not use it again.The colors seemed washed out and contrast wasn't there. However, my main complaint is graininess. I've seen much smoother images from ISO 1000.Perhaps others may have better results, but I'll be shooting Royal Gold 400 until something better comes along."
2,Great Skiers Don't Always Make Great Instructors,"I purchased this video and I am disappointed. The video largely consists of three pros talking about skiing, and then videos of them skiing. There are no slow-motion shots or enhanced videos with highlights/arrows, etc. showing the areas of the body to concentrate on. The pros are somewhat rigid and look like they are reading from a script. I would have liked to see more diagrams on the videos and less special effects that make the video attractive to watch, but have little information. This video would be great to watch while standing in a lift line!"
2,For Level 42 Completists Only,"Sadly, this recording was a dissappointment to me. ""A Physical Presence"", their other live set from the same general time period, is vastly superior in perhaps every way other than song selection. The playing and recording qualities are both much better on APP (""River Sessions"" sounds like a board recording). It comes as no surprise to me that this recording sat around for 20 years before someone released it.If you really dig Level 42 (as I do), you'll want this to round out your collection. And, to be fair, there are live takes of a few tracks on here that can't be found live anywhere else. But it won't win any new fans for Level 42, and Physical Presence will, even this much later."
4,"From a Sinner, Just Like all of Us",I think Mike has suffered enough. He has asked for forgiveness and has repented. Ya got to wonder why the church wants to kick and shoot their wounded??? Give Mike a break unless you can cast the first stone.
3,Not as good as the movie,"This is a story about two men who spend much of their life in prison. And there is nothing supernatural about it at all! I enjoyed this Stephen King story enough to pass the time listening while on the road (the audio-book), but I recalled liking the movie a lot more. After finishing, I watched the movie again, and loved it. About 80% of the movie is from the book, but the movie includes some great additional scenes. Also, the book is told by Red, and everything we see is through his eyes. Yet that makes the listener less connected to the main character, Andy Dufresne. So, while the novella falls a little short for me, the story is still a classic."
5,i couldn't believe it...,"...as i sat in my buddy's dorm room on a cold, thundering night in late april, i secretly fell in love with the movie, ""Shawshank Redemption,"".who would have guessed, but this movie was by one of my most favorite authors --- stephen king.up until a few moments ago, that movie was on my hit list of one of the best, all-time movies to see...now it's on my hit list to read the book!cruising into amazon.com, and looking *eagerly* for the latest book --- hopefully the fourth and finale in the gunslinger series --- i ""fatefully"" stumbled on the book entitled ""Shawshank Redemption"".thinking it had to be a fluke, i clicked on the bio of the tale. now, pleasantly surprised......i'm buying the book --- not only because it's possibly the best movie i have seen of the nineties, but because i know it's got to be good if it's written by stephen king!---poetchick@hotmail.com"
2,Cannot recommend,"I bought this book one month prior to taking the CBEST. I thought the reading comprehension portion was too short and not very helpful in sorting out the test's ""best"" answers. The math portion was lengthy, and in the end helpful, however there were many typos and incorrect answers! This made the math section frustrating. Fortunately, I live with a ""math person"" who helped me. Today I bought two new study guides that were highly recommended on amazon. Hope they are more helpful!"
1,The Standard Yet Typographical Errors?,"Alright so basically I thought this book would be the most helpful in studying for the CBEST which I am taking in a week from tomorrow. Over the course of studying and trying the practice tests I wish I had invested in the CliffsTestPrep CBEST right off the bat instead of having to run out and purchase it tonight. Kaplan is supposed to be a good company for study guides such as this yet they make typographical errors and especially when they are on the practice test portions you can imagine why this becomes a problem. Such errors as using ""?"" in place of the multiplication sign and the not equal to sign in place of the pie sign? I mean come on, you're training people to pass their CBEST yet you're making such errors? Not to mention at times it was a bit hard to follow. I would not recommend this book to anyone. You want a good study guide for the CBEST? Go purchase CliffsTestPrep CBEST instead."
1,Do not use this book!,The questions are way too difficult! This book will discourage you! I suggest using Cracking the CBEST! I passed the exam on the first try!!!
2,waste of money and TIME!,"unless you have plenty of time and money to waste i would never recommed this book who want to pass thru cbest. This book is so confusing , presentation of the material is so poor, difficulty level doesnt reflect that of CBEST.if you want to pass with good marks go for princetons or cliffs.GOOD LUCK:)"
3,Covered a bit too much,"I purchased my Kaplan CBEST Prep Book through Amazon because frankly, Amazon offers the BEST price for this book and the shipping was quick. I used this book exclusively for a month prior to taking the exam and it helped but also stressed me out more than necessary. The questions for the reading comprehension and math sections were much harder in this book than on the actual test. Let's just say, I was over prepared for the exam and passed with flying colors. The essay questions presented in this book are similar to the questions asked on the exam. As the poster below me stated, there is no explanation for how to score yourself and that would have been a helpful tool."
4,OP Live on stage,"OP at his (usual) best. The recordings focus on the ensemble, rather than just OP, highlighting the virtuosity of Ed Thigpen and Ray Brown. The sound is less than perfect, but who cares: Superb jazz!"
1,Nothing New,"I've been a comedy fan for many years, I have over 400 comedy albums, including all of Jeff Foxworthy's albums, sadly, this album is no better then his ""Greatest Bits"", and long time fans will noot find any new material from Jeff exept the dvd clips which I find too short and just musical, not comedy."
5,Handy Holder,"I thought this would be handy, but I found I use it a lot more than I expected. It holds cords, wires, anything you want to hold in place by fixing it in place to something else. Telephone cords, computer cords, anything with a cord stays in place and out of the way. Great way to hang hoses, extension cords. Just wrap it up with Fastwrap. You can even velcro your kids to the chair to keep them out of your hair! (I haven't personally tried this)"
2,Good product but too expensive,"I ordered two products on the same day. One is this Fastwrap product and the other is the tie wrap from Velcro that comes in 100 strips of that are 8"" long. Both products are the same price, but this product comes in one 10 feet roll while the Velcro brand product contains 100 pieces which equates to 33 feet of material.Obviously the individual tie wraps doesn't come with the flexibility of one long strip, but I can't help but to think that this product is over-priced when another package comes with 3 times the material. (to top it off, I bought the Velcro product during an Amazon sale at a price of $6.29)"
5,Many uses,"I've purchased two rolls of this and use it for the many charging cords I've accumulated. I've had other, thicker hook and loop rolls. This is very thin and so very flexible. The best I've found."
1,Dennis in Tucson,"From the photograph displayed on Amazon, I thought I was paying for an original Mr. Coffee D40 replacement decanter. What I got was a cheap knock-off made by a company called MEDELCO. It was a real disappointment."
3,fine for mr coffee,"It's fine for Mr. Coffee coffee makers, but alas it's too low for kitchenaid coffee makers."
2,Monkey Doesn't Do It,"Was waiting whole movie to see a monkey, Very B movie. If you want to be scared more than this movie watch episode of SEINFELD."
1,Now u can avoid 3 for 1,3 bad movies for the price of one! What a bargain. Instead of wasting 90 minutes of your life you can now waste about 270 minutes!
4,Gas Your Way To Happiness:),"It's just a super funny way to celebrate the holidays, especially when things can get so stressed at times. I bought it & my children & entire family laughed & laughed - the best gift (next to good health & tons of money) anyone could give those with a sense of humor:)"
3,It's a gas,"Got this for the kids, they wouldn't stop giggling when I first put it on, and I can still get a chuckle occasionally."
1,True to its title,"Sadly, I thought this CD would be something like the Bob Rivers twisted versions of Christmas carols. It is truly what its title implies: stinky. A really crass form of what some would call humor, the songs are entirely comprised of flatulence from both ends. Live and learn, I guess."
1,Never received,"Very hard to rate something you never received. I wrote them to say I had not received the product and they said they were back ordered. Well I ordered this 4-23-09 and now it's June 13, 2009 and still have not received it. I ordered from Amazon because I have always had success in getting everything in a timely fashion. Will this ruin my relationship with Amazon?????"
1,This adapter ruined my tapes.,"I bought this product in 2008, used it a couple of times and am afraid to use it again. When I used this adapter, I noticed that the sound on my tapes was unintelligible. I then noticed that the very edges of the tapes were crinkled after playing, and the unintelligible sound is permanent."
4,Panasonic VHS C Adapter,Ordered to replace my broken adapter that came with my VHS C camera. Just glad that some of the older technology is still supported. I still have a lot of tapes that I need to move to DVD.
1,Very defective and looking for a way to return it.,"First of all, the battery slot has no cover. I was able to get a battery in and it stays in but the adapter does not work. It worked very slowly at first but then it didn't work at all. I was able to get the VHS C tape in but that's all. It does not work. After paying $39.99 for the adapter and another $39.99 for shipping (actually the label on the box shows it cost only $10.25 to ship it), you would think I could get a product that works. It does not. I changed the battery four times to be sure I didn't have a defective battery. I would like to return this but can't get a response. I had a couple of these before so I know how they work. This definitely is defective and very old. It is now new, as advertized.One more thing: This was not a Panasonic as advertized but an unknown brand."
2,Fundamental,"It's really a fundamental book of communication especially on writing, even for a reader, English is not the native language. I can't see special focus on business."
1,Horrible fit,"Sorry but my other review posted was for the ""Adidas Stan Smith Hardware W"" -womens size 9.5---That I purchased after returning these. Those are great. THESE ARE ENTIRELY DIFFERENT. These are not true to size--They were more like a 10.5"
3,"Good shoe, but....","I received this shoe last christmas. It fit great. and I figured it would last for quite some time. Fast forward to this indoor season. Last night I noticed that the sole was pulling away from the rest of the shoe. I am so disappointed. The last pair of indoor shoes I owned, I had for 7 years, with no problems.If you are looking for a good indoor shoe, that will last, look another place. I should not have to superglue a shoe that is only on its second indoor season."
5,As One Dead,I hold no allusions that vampire novels in many and most cases are pretty much brain candy. but this book was not only entertaining but containg aslo a complex political subplot that interwove with the tribal activities of the sabbat and the self indugent attitudes of the camirilla towards the masquerade. this vamp book is an intriging love story as well that ranks up there with the Sonja Blue stories.
3,Works good but...,I just started taking this & like it so far but beware there is a warning on the label that says this stuff cannot be combined with antidepressants such as MAOIs or SSRIs.
2,Tyler is All about the Money!,Please believe that this guy is only trying to sell his information. He is so busy selling that he dosen't allow this book to help people. He should of just placed alot of classified ads for all the offers that are in this book. You will be able to find very little info that will be helpful to you. So I would advise that you just skim through this book at your local libary or book store and pick out what you need to know and thats it.
1,Do Not Waste Your Money,"Buy yourself a dinner at Boston Market , you'll get more out of it. This book is a tool for ol Tyler to sell his stuff to you"
2,Not that great,"This book was not that great. It gave one some good examples of Home.B.B but it did not go into any real detail. He mostly uses it as a platform to sell his newsletter and other books. I mean if this guy is suppose to have all of the answers how come he has the words.. ""The complete Guide""... to all of his titles of the same type of book?"
4,Blankety Blank,"A blank is a blank is a blank. This is a blank...but it's a good blank. Middle Atlantic makes some great product, and as far as blanks go, this one is decent."
1,A mere copy of 30 min. TV program,"What I wanted from this video was to watch as many sceneries and places to visit as possible. I did not want to see ads of cafes or restaurants. Also, 30 minutes was too short to satisfy my interests in Sydney. 13.99 US dollars was too high compared to its content."
5,carol field is the italian tradition maven,"I highly recommend all Carol Field books, even if you don't cook. She TAKES you to Italy and FEEDS you. She writes engrossing and vividly descriptive literature which also happens to contain really great, authentic Italian recipes. Celebrating Italy will make you want to move to Italy and eat all day and night."
2,same old same old,"Lillian Ross's contributions to the Talk of the Town and to the full-length piece are estimable, but she was never one of great talents at the magazine. She has a real flair, though, for recycling her old work. The more you reread it, the thinner it becomes."
2,Lousy,"Once upon a time I used to revere Lillian Ross for her acerbic portrait of Hemingway and her up and down account of the making of John Huston's film of The Red Badge of Courage.Now when I read her work, in the New Yorker or in omnibuses like this one, I see she is not a great writer, but am ordinary one, and in REPORTING BACK a woman who cannot stop herself from patting herself on the back till it hurts. Don't think I've ever read such a self-congratulatory work. How do people stand her? She says she doesn't like to write about people unless she likes them, but from her writing, one gets the impression she feels superior to everyone, always quoting the little non sequiturs people make by mistake, to make them look stupid.The idol has feet of clay."
5,film student,"Have you ever read some of these long reviews people write haha. Anyone know the song that Charlotte- Scarlett Johansson sings with the wig on, kind of an 80's song. I cannot remember the song right now and we are taken bets on who that was. Anyone?Oh yeah the soundtrack is good woohoo amazon.com rocks yippie"
1,THEY FORGOT TO PUT IN CHEMICAL BROS. and BETH ORTON!!!!,"was it just me or did they forget to put in this soundtrack Chemical Brothers' song ""The State We're In"" with Beth Orton-vocals? The song was playing at the first club Bob and Charlotte went to...Buy the CD ""Come with Us"" by Chemical Brothers....AIR is also from Astralwerks....Astralwerks rocks! home of Fatboy Slim, Basement Jaxx, Sondre Lerche, Beta Band......www.astralwerks.com"
2,uninspired.,"I am yet another Kevin Shields groupie. Unfortunately, this CD is disappointing. I was expecting a lot more based on Kevin Shields' recent work with Primal Scream, but his songs here are boring and uninspired. yawn."
4,"Not a review, just a question","great movie and soundtrack, but i was wondering if anyone knows the song that is playing in the night club (not the peaches song) the scene when bob is talking to the japanese surfers...it's a great song and i'd love to know more about it."
3,Fairly mellow...,"For some reason, I bought this soundtrack thinking that it contained Bill Murray's singing from the karaoke bar scene. I actually like his version better than original singers'. Lack of paying attention on my part. I thought one soundtrack kinds melt into the next....meaning, they all sounded the same after a while. But still decent to listen to if you want to relax and mellow out."
4,Unique Music for a Unique Film,"I loved the music on this CD. It fits perfectly the feel and tone that Sophia Coppola and Bill Murray have given to Lost in Translation. But it also doesn't feel like just a movie soundtrack - I think it could stand as a CD on its own without the movie. The songs go that well together.Really great movie, on a great Soundtrack CD."
4,ARS,"This is an excellent soundtrack, and exactly the right tone for the movie. To answer an earlier reviewer's question, the song ""So Into You"" performed in one of the lounge scenes is a song from '70s by the Atlanta Rhythm Section. Great song, too. Check out their greatest hits CD."
4,Great Soundtrack,"Does truly capture the mood of the movie. Rivals Royal Tenenbaums (I think) in that aspect. Even if you haven't seen the movie, I recommend the soundtrack tho. By the way, not sure if anyone knows but, the song played in the movie towards the end ""So Into You"" at the bar by the guitarast and pianist - who sings it/wrote it? Where can I find it? It's the only thing this soundtrack's missing!"
5,"Melody, I found the song we have both been looking for!!!","The song is ""Too Young"" by Phoenix and it is fortunately on the soundtrack. It comes from Phoenix's United album that is available on Amazon. Cheers!"
5,Lost In Translation - Soundtrack,"Ok. My review is going to be biased and prejudicial. I PREORDEREDthis CD because I was so excited about seeing the film, I wantedto be ""ready"" to match the music to the images on screen. Thiscompilation is ambient and beautiful. It is sometimes serene thenplayful...and sometimes heartbreaking. But the REAL REASON thiscd brought me to tears was there is a HIDDEN TRACK, people!! Atthe end of #15...wait until 11:00 minutes or so and you'll be treated to BILL MURRAY's karakoe version of ""More Than This"". Iwould buy this CD AGAIN..just for the 1 minute of his soul wrenching beauty that captures the spirit of ""Lost In Translation"".Thank You."
5,music to get lost by...,"If you have seen this movie and looking up this soundtrack, chances are you have been affected by it as much as I and many others have. The movie itself is best viewed late at night, in a dimly lit (not dark) room, especially after a difficult day at work. This soundtrack is best listened to in a car, again at night, while flying aimlessly down a dark highway, lit only by the occassional headlamps of passing cars, or the streetlights of a nighttime cityscape. You WILL feel as if you are half asleep in a taxi with Bob and Charlotte after a long nite out in Tokyo. Absolutely fantastic and flawless collection of sonic atmosphere. Dig in..."
4,Need to know who sang this song?,"Hi,In the movie, the piano player at the bar played an old song "" I am so into you"". Does anyone know who originally recorded this song. I need to know. ThanksEllen"
4,Brass in Pocket,"For the person that thought the song that Scarlett Johanssen sings was a song by Blondie, it wasn't. It's the Pretenders Brass in Pocket."
4,More Than This,"Bill Murray's karaoke performance is included on the CD version I got at the store the other day...it is a ""hidden track"" at the end of the last song on the CD (Jesus and Mary Chain). Just go to about 11:05 or so. I personally don't see why it would be such a problem to make it its own track. As it is, the eight minutes of silence are rather lame and annoying."
5,"great soundtrack, but a good album in it's own right.","I left the theatre after seeing this movie really wanting to find out more about the soundtrack, and I have not been disapointed. I'm a little biased though, as I'm a huge fan of My Bloody Valentine and the Mary Chain. I wasn't surprised to find out that Kevin Shields was behind this."
4,Lost in Translation,I like all the songs very much but was disappointed that the one song in the movie I really liked was not on the CD.
5,LIST OF SONGS IN MOVIE,GO TO http://imdb.com/title/tt0335266/soundtrackand a lot of songs are listed there from the movie...if the link doesn't work...it's imdb.com and just type in lost in translation....not just the soundtrack songs are listed there...mesmerizing and mindbending soundtrack by the way...makes you kind of wonder.
4,that song,"The song in the taxi ride home was the My Bloody Valentine song, Sometimes which is on the soundtrack. It's off their masterpiece Loveless. But what I wanna know is, what's the song playing in the Club on their night out, while all those big white balloons have movies of fireworks playing on them. Song will not leave my head and I've only heard about 30 secs of it clearly. Help would be appreciated."
3,The Latest Indicators Are Not Necessarily The Best,"This is a decent book. However, I really do not see what great advantage StochRSI and VHF can present the prospective reader. Both of these indicators are very jumpy, so you do get a headstart but at what cost? Slower indicators on the other hand get you in later usually towards the middle or the end of a move. Each has it's own advantage and disadvantage. Though it is important to remember that consistency is what works in the long run. I will say that Mr.Chande seems like a respectable writer. This is much more than I can say for the vast majority of authors out there. One last thing, trading is not about having the latest indicators. Trading consists of three equally important parts; methodology, pyschology and risk managment. If you are missing one you will surely fail over the long run. This book consists primarily of methodology but it is not too different from most of the material already out there."
5,Good music,I really enjoyed this DVD. Everytime I watch it it makes me get up and dance. Good purchase!!
1,unfunny...and that's putting it mildly,"If I may offer a bit of advice to the folks behind this unwatchable clunker: hold on to your day job. Filmmaking is not something you have any talent for.How did I end up with this godawful video in the first place?You got me. Sent my kid to Blockbuster for something with Chaplin in it & he comes back with this idiotic mess. We took it back to the store. Clerk said he had no idea how this particular tape ended up in a box intended for a Chaplin movie, etc. Well, we ended up with a good Chaplin comedy after all, but as far as this diet video goes: What a waste of time, money and effort."
2,It's nice.... Until it falls apart.,"Well, I loved it until I actually tried using it for the first time yesterday. All I did was carry it around for about 20 min. and the plastic around the ball -that piece of plastic surrounding the ball, so that when you move your camera to the vertical position that plastic piece goes with it- just completely became loose from the top. So, if I would have wanted to take a vertical photo, I would have had to manually move the piece so that my camera could switch into the vertical position. And then I'd have to manually move it so that I could move it back into the horizontal position. It's ridiculous. I only had it for a couple of weeks, finally took it out yesterday, didn't even use the thing and it fell apart."
5,Heavy Duty,"Shipping is fast! Use it on my astro binocs, I mounted pistol grip on my Induro 8M tripod supports my big glass 20X80 binoc's nice quick realese solid feel."
2,Be warned- doesn't hold up,"Pistol grips are a great way to quickly tilt/pan/adjust, but the pro ones are prohibitively expensive. So I gave this one a shot for a trip to Europe.You get what you pay for. With a Canon 50D and an 18-85mm lens, this head became unstable after less than an hour (despite that the head says it can hold 6+ pounds). Unacceptable ""wiggle"" with the head which makes multiframe HDR photography impossible.If you have a decent tripod and want good results, save your $$ for a real ball head."
4,"It's conceptually awesome, some shake that's concerning","I bought this head to replace a pan/tilt head that I had on my sunpak 623 carbon fiber tripod. I am concerned about the weight limit, as it's not robust enough for my 80-200 2.8 lens and body. There was give in the plate with the mount secured with a much smaller lense (28-105). Super easy to use and has a level. Solid, but has room for improvement."
3,"Worked, but was deathly slow","This program worked and I was able to recover all of my files off a crashed external HD, so I give it 3 stars. It took 42 hours to scan my 2TB hard drive though, which was annoying. Then I copied some of the files off and the program crashed, so I had to scan AGAIN. All in all, I had to scan 5 times because the program kept crashing, but I finally got my stuff off."
1,Totally useless program,"As an IT pro I have tried this program on numerous occasions and it has never once been able to recover anything valuable. Like all the other useless undelete programs I have tried, it's great at finding totally irrelevant temp files or other debris from several months or years ago, but completely worthless when attempting to salvage a meaningful file deleted an hour ago.Not worth one penny. Manual backups are the only reliable way I have found to protect data. Don't waste your time on this junk - the only thing more frustrating than losing a significant file is dealing with a program that claims to be able to recover it but just winds up dealing in false promises and bogus hopes."
3,Recover My Files,"I would have given this product a 5 star, however, the version that came from Amazon is an older version and when I ran it, it took 4 days instead of the 8 hours that it took me to run the latest version downloaded from the GetData website. I ended up returning it and downloaded the latest and it took me less because when I try to save, it took forever to do anything since it ate up all of my virtual memory from the machine.To be fair, the latest version recovered all the files that I lost (I reformatted my HD accidently through recovering from a crash). I would still recommend it but I would get the latest even if you had to pay a little more."
5,awesome!!,"I've only used one other file recovery program before and this one blows it out of the water!! I scanned a 160gig hard drive for every file type searchable and it took 6 days to scan. I should've narrowed it down to only the file types I was searching for. I performed another search for 3 file types and it only took 2 hours. It recovered my videos, pictures, and songs along with every other file imaginable!!!! Well worth the money!!! If your hard drive crashed because of a physical defect (making grinding noise), I wouldn't try it....send it in and pay the money if need-be. But if it crashed because the drive became unrecognizable, corrupted, or accidentally reformatted or deleted use this product before paying hundreds of dollars!!!"
4,A Royal Marine`s long journey home,"The previous reviewer, Mr Thielen, makes the point that this book was written in a style reminicent of an earlier time: I personally enjoyed this as it seemed to give the account authority, relating the depth and intensity of this experience without undue exaggeration.James Pleasor`s account of a Royal Marine`s largely solitary march through Burma was a testament to one young ""bootneck`s"" spirit of determination to evade capture by the Japanese and return to the Corps. The frustrating bureaucracy and inertia he encountered after arriving back behind British lines was something that will have rung true with those who have suffered this too!"
4,Great detailed instruction,Billy Robinson gives a great amount of detail for the basics of Catch as Catch Can Wrestling from the footwork to take-downs. The only reason I would not give the full 5 stars is because the audio is not the greatest and it can be difficult at times to understand what Billy is saying. Other than the audio issue this is a must buy for those who want to know the basics of catch wrestling.
2,Very Disappointed,I was very disapoined in my purchase. First of all it didn't arrive in a timely manner. It was way over priced for what it was. I would not order this product again.
3,Good deal but poor quality,This is an excellent deal for any horror fan. The only bad part is the dvd quality. This is by far the worst quality I have ever seen. Dont get me wrong it is watchable but annoying.
1,Cheap Junk,"Within two minutes into assembling this flimsy piece of junk, I regretted that I didn't get a Weber. Thin-guage metal & enamel with bolt-on plastic handles that crack and fall off. I took it back to Home Depot and paid the extra money for a Weber. Don't buy!"
2,Just okay.,"The lid was made well, but the bottom half was thinner and cheaply made. It rusted out after not that long. Spend an extra twenty or thirty bucks and get a weber (The weber is better suited for low and slow indirect heat/smoking- less air leaks and with a decade long warranty which you will probably not need). Trust me, its worth it."
4,Living of the four foods,A great old book taking you back to when life was simpler. Easy to follow reciepts to using famous four. Its a great book that I hope I never have to use to survive.
2,"Not logical survival, a waste of time...","Simply put, you could look at the outside of the book instead of reading the inside to get the moral of the book. The outside cover shows you the 4 primary foods which are wheat, salt, honey, and powdered milk. The first half of the book is nothing but info on these 4, only she stated that she was humiliated for not knowing the nutritional values of these foods. The rest of the book gives you a little advice on survival skills, but doesn't go in depth. This book focuses on short term survival, if a disaster were to happen. She talks about how you can have fun with these 4 foods by creating necklaces, and doll houses. Not realistic if a disaster were to happen if you ask me. As far as the ""cookbook"" section goes, you need an oven for most of these things which wouldn't be practical in the event of a doomsday-scenario..."

I recommend the book Back to Basics if anybody wants to know how to start from the beginning and improve on it. A survivalist must-have book."
2,Good tracks but mediocre sound quality and bad mixes.,"The track selection is good. Most of the songs are classics presented in their extended versions. However, the CD has two basic problems: 1) The audio quality is fair at best. In some tracks it is plain mediocre; muffled and somewhat distorted. 2) The songs are mixed into each other and most mixes are bad. Most songs are chopped off at the end or at the intro. Save the money and skip this one.To the company that produced this CD: You have a potential jewel in here. Improve the sound quality and redo the mixes, and you got one outstanding product."
4,"Lovely, enchanting and sadly overlooked when it was released","Far too many so-called fantasy films (Labyrinth, anything by Terry Jones, Legend, etc) sink all their energy into production values and kick the magic right out the door. They end up lumpen, leaden, anything but enchanting, and either leave kids snoring or scared silly.Fairy Tale: A True Story is everyting that these so-called kid's films are not. Genuinely enchanting, beautifully photographed and with an all round excellent cast.Sadly overlooked and/or dismissed by critics when it was released theatrically, you have a second chance to do your kids a favor--especially if they love imps, elves, faries and all the other little people, and rent, then watch this one with them.The real girls made their fairy folk out of book illustrations. If this filmmaker's fairies had been around then, we'd all all be believers today."
3,"It's cute, but not all that its cracked up to be.",I expected my daughter to love this movie based on the reviews. It is alright! My daughter is 3 and loves these kinds of movies. She might be a little young for this movie.
3,For a girl who loves fairies,"This was bought for a 3 year old who loves everything with fairies. I probably wouldn't recommend this for this age range unless there is obsession with the subject. It's slow at points and it's with real-people vs cartoons. If you have run out of fairy options then this is worth a try, if you are looking for first time fairy movies for your kid... aim for the TinkerBell series."
5,An Extraordinary Charmer,"A five-year old girl was to be my guest for dinner (along with her parents), and I wanted to have something she could entertain herself with while the adults talked. With the advice of a store clerk, I rented five or six different titles suitable for young children. Without a moment's hesitation, my young guest selected this film from my pile. She was right on. We all watched it together, entranced. It is the most tasteful, convincing, and interesting piece of fantasy I have ever seen on film. With a rich subtext of questions about faith, illusion, and a society in crisis, a marvellous cast (Harvey Keitel as Harry Houdini! Peter O'Toole as Arthur Conan Doyle!), and special effects that seem as natural as the fine actors in their Yorkshire settings, this is a gem. No, I don't believe in fairies. But I can allow myself to be transported into a world of illusion, beauty, hope, and magic."
3,Fairy good,"It is the true story of 2 children(well,actually,I have read all about the Cottingly Fairies and the real girls were teens)who insist they have seen fairies.While nice,it was also rather boring."
1,booorriiinngg!!,"This movie was sooooo boring, it didn't have anything. Where's the comedy? Where's the action? Where's the romance? This is what I think the worst movie I ever saw in theatres. And the fiaries. You only saw one fairy,in the beginning and then a lot at the end, but that's all. How cheesy is that? To me, this movie was very unmemorable, because I hardly remember much, which might be good. It just seemed like nothing. This movie hardly had any plot. They're just trying to prove fairies exist. I remember me, my brother, Mat and my Dad being quite bored by it. I should have saw some other movie at the time like ""A Simple Wish"". In other words, skip it."
1,HORRIBLE,"if youre getting this movie for your kid, or any kid, save them the misery. i remember seeing this movie the day it came out, and it was so awful i fell asleep, along with about 5 other kids in the theater. it was by far the WORST movie i have ever seen in my entire life, even worse than that planet of the apes movie. and trust me, i have seen almost every movie that comes out. spare your kids the pain and spare yourself some money. DONT get this movie for them."
5,Fairy Tale _A True Story,"A wonderful movie about Two young girls who take photos of Fairies down behind their home. The scenery, cinematography and the introduction of famous people of the time round out the movie beautifully. Great for all ages"
5,Breathtaking!,"My brother saw this movie and asked if I had seen it. He said the 2 little girls remined him of my granddaughters, Anna and Brooke.So I went straight to Amazon and sent a copy to him and to me. We loved it and planned to watch it again and again. This movie is perfect in every way. It reminds of of Anna and Brooke too.so people, buy it and you will be smitten just like we are!Sandra Neely"
4,"Touching period film, with an intensity that makes it much more than a children's film","This movie had me and my wife guessing where it was going to end. The magic in this beautiful period movie is handled very well, and all the performances are top notch. Yet I wouldn't recommend this for a younger audience; my children were troubled and scared in several places. For older children, the questions and issues that this movie brings up could be wonderful conversation starters -- for thoughtful pre-teens and young teens. Again, wonderfully shot and acted. Sound design and music were excellent as well."
5,Fairy Tale - A True Story,"At first I thought the movie Fairy Tale - A True Story might just be intended for children, but my wife & I truly enjoyed it. It's a movie the entire family can watch together and enjoy from beginning to end. The scenery and photography are fantastic. I was glad that I bought the DVD."
1,AWFUL!! Watch with the mute button on,"I totally agree with the comments another reviewer gave this DVD. The stretches are helpful but the DVD is annoying beyond belief and not worth buying because the host talks through the entire thing!! Not something one would want to watch over and over. It would have been best if they had a seperate section for commentary and one for the actual routines. Beautiful classical music in the background but you couldn't even focus on it because she talked SO MUCH! A ""little"" of instruction guides one through properly. A ""lot"" of instruction and storytelling is not relaxing or helpful."
3,Solid Stretching - Speedy With Limited Explanations,"I have suffered back pain for about 20 years. Based on the other review of this DVD, I purchased it. My comments are that the stretches are good and the DVD appears to deliver what is promised in a no-nonsense style.Pros:1) Good variety of stretches2) The instructor is down to earth, a real person who also suffers back pain and is practical.3) Only a chair is needed for the stretchesCons:1) You have to watch carefully how the instructor does the stretches - she does not explain all the moves.2) While watching the stretches, to see how they are done, you often have to crane your neck up - the opposite of what the stretch calls for.3) The switch from one stretch movement to the next is often too quick, but to the credit of the instructor, she reminds you you can pause the DVD.Overall a good routine, and I must confess, my back does appear better after the stretches."
4,helpful for back pain,I have had severe facet pain and have arthritis in my lower back. This video really does help with it. It provides a good stretch and does not cause pain. Ms White states on the video that she too is a back pain sufferer. The only problem I have with it is that one of the stretches she does with an extended leg while sitting on a chair is impossible for me to do. She is extremely flexible but I am not!!
5,Beautiful and affordable,"I bought this as a Christmas gift and loved it! I hope to buy it for myself. I was looking for something that wasn't as heavy as most stoneware sets, and I found it. The horses on it aren't ""cheesy"", and the price was unbelievable. Most items that have horses on them cost three times as much. This was a great deal for great quality. The bowls and mugs are larger than most dinnerware sets - which my friends absolutely loved."
4,Redford & Wood are tragically beautiful,"A must see for any Natalie Wood fan. A truly moving piece about love, but more about manipulation, desperation, and those who escape their realities looking for something better. Robert Redford is handsome yet unforgiving, and the supporting characters act out their grunginess for railroad town. It wrenches at your heart and the song ""Wish me a Rainbow"" will haunt your memory of the film."
5,One of my favorite movies,Natalie Wood at her best! She is amazing and stunningly beautiful in this movie. A must see for Natalie Wood fans.
5,Excellent,Great movie. Well outlined. Two of the greatest actors in that era star in the movie and both well dipict the charactors eloquently.
3,This Property Is Condemned,"Older movie with an all star cast, but not very moving or any thing else--"
3,The ending ruined it all,"I guess I'm the only the one, but the ending seemed rushed to me. I was left thinking ""What?"" It was as if the writer was like ""Okay, time to end this movie. Let me pull something out of my a$$ and see if that works."" It doesn't. I do love Natalie, but this is not one of her best as far as story goes. My favorite scene is when she gets drunk and yells at her mother. I also liked how she liked to fantasize. Other than, there's really no point for a repeat viewing."
4,"A powerful story of love, duty and idealism.","This movie is vastly underappreciated. It is a timeless and powerful story of love and cultural differences. Owen grapples with his duty which is in conflict with his compassion. Alva's idealistic view of the world clashes with its realities. Her dreams are impractical yet they are exactly what Owen lacks and what draws them together. The rest of the cast delivers great supporting performances, especially Badham, Bronson and Blake. This is one of my favorite movies. It always transports me and I leave it grudgingly, wishing I too could be caught up in Alva's world. Although it has an all star cast, the star is the story, which is as it should be."
2,Redford Casting Mistake,Robert Redford would have been my first choice had his character been a northern sophisticated elite. Legatt's character is too unsophisticated for Redford. Neither his portrayal of the character nor his southern drawl are convincing. Martin Sheen would have been a better choice.
2,This Property is Condemned,"I was very disappointed by this movie. The only redeeming thing about it was Robert Redford and he couldnt even save this movie. First of all if you are looking for an uplifting movie with a happy ending, this one is not for you. Natalie Wood is gorgeous but I found her character to be so slutty that I did not like her at all and did not find her worthy of Robert Redfords character. All in all, I would suggest to Robert Redford fans to stick with some of his other great movies like Barefoot in the Park and The Way We Were-you can never go wrong with those movies, they are truly timeless."
2,Not what I was looking for.,"This book was not what I was looking for. I was searching for a book suitable for a young girl to be introduced to drying flowers. I had a flower press from when I was a young girl, but I couldn't find the book I got with the flower press and so I was looking for something that would be easy to read, and contain a lot of pictures for a little girl. I will continue to look for a more suitable age-related one."
5,YOU WILL NEVER FORGIVE YOURSELF IF YOU READ IT ABRIDGED,"Okay, the size is intimidating at first, but I'm 12 and I still was thoroughly absorbed in it. The characters were dbeautifuly done and the plot was masterful. Okay, Hugo apparently never heard the word ""edit"" but I feel proud being able to say that I read the WHOLE THING."
1,"don't buy this version of ""Les Miserables""","This is only one part of the Victor Hugo epic, just the part about Cosette. Although the translation is excellent, you only get one minor part of the story."
3,Not unabridged,"Although this is listed as ""unabridged"" the packaging that arrived was in fact an abridged version of Les Miserable. On the plus side it is well recorded and plenty long enough to last for many trips to work."
4,Excellent but long,"The writing is fantastic, and long. I would not, in spite of its length, recommend any abridged version. Who would read an abridged version of War and Peace or of Anna Karennina?The first many chapters (yes, chapters!) describe the bishop - and were a delightful experience. There are sections that drag on - such as the battlefield at Waterloo, and so forth - and sections that do not seem to be relevant to the story, but are relevant to context (sort of). For example, the author goes on at some length about the convent, its history, and in general expresses his opinions at length about convents and monastaries.His love of France and of Paris especially are completely visible and plain to see.This book is worth getting, and reading through. But imagine my surprise when, stacked side by side with War and Peace (often used as the definitive example of a looooooong English novel), I found Les Miserables to be the same size and length as War and Peace.No matter. Read it anyway."
2,Les Miserables,I loved the movie but I found the book heavy and ponderous. I could not get through it and gave it up after about 200 pages. All of the characters were either totally good or totally evil.
4,Discovered great story,"I had recently watched the PBS musical of the story, and realized the beautiful plot, that I had never successfully read previously to my recall. Ordered the book, and read it with ease, enjoying every detail. Amazon was fast with the delivery, inexpensive and the book arrived in good shape. No complaints here!"
2,Not smart enough to read this.,I dont have anything against the book other than its way over my head. I am going to see the movie ant then try to read the book.
3,LES MISERABLES,"I GAVE THE BOOK A 3 STAR AS I FELT IT WAS O.K. AND HAS HISTORICAL SIGNIFANCE BUT IT IS A VERY DIFFICULT READ. THE PROSE IS LONG AND YOU CAN GET LOST IN THE DESCRIPTIVE PHRASES AND LOSE THE TRACK OF THE STORY. IT MOVES VERY SLOW. ALSO THE BOOK IS DEPRESSING. THIS IS ONE SAD BOOK SO DON'T READ IT IF YOU WANT AN UPLIFTING MOOD TO BE THE RESULT. IT IS INTERESTING IN SOME WAY BUT IT IS TRAGEDY!SO IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A LONG READ AND ARE PREPARED FOR THE ""DOWN"" FEELING THIS BOOK RESULTS IN WELL O.K."
3,Heavy going,"Good book but a little slow with heavy, historical detail in some sections. The parts which describe the main characters are much more interesting."
4,Excellent,"When I bought this book, I had already read the full version of Les Miserables- Which is AMAZING, by the way. This version cuts out the descriptions of both the covent and Waterloo which rather improved it. Those parts are still very good writing; but when I want to find out what happens next to Jean Valjean and Cosette and instead I get 100 pages telling me about this convent, well, It gets a tad frusterating. Especially since you can't tell whether it's important or not. (and believe me, it isn't.)So, those cuts were good.However, I was very disapointed at the cut of a lot of Marius's love letter to Cosette. The editors kept a few lines, but it loses the flow and beauty of the original letter. Yes, I know the letter was four pages to begin with, but I still think that it's worth reading.On the whole, this version is worth buying, as the story isn't hurt at all by the cuts.But the original version is still worth reading."
1,Edited with a chainsaw.,"Extremely disappointed with the abridging of this book. For example, almost 19 chapters are omitted regarding Waterloo. Not only is Hugo's telling of the battle moving, the artistic strokes of the pen, descriptions and insight are what classic novels and literature are all about. I suppose under Porter's cuttings, the Louve would only feature the Mona Lisa and sparsely anything else.Readers of this edition are robbed of fantastic writing and to try and claim you have read Les Miserables through this edition is like claiming to be a doctor by having a subscription to the journal of medicine. 'This book was a WASTE of my money and full and true edition faithful to Hugo's vision needed to be purchased"
5,Les Miserables,Very good book. Enjoyed the detail and description of the characters and the life in those times. It did make me cry.
4,Just my opinion,"The story was wonderful. But since I am NOT a person who is into history, the parts of the book describing the battle of Waterloo and any other history I pretty much skimmed over."
3,long read,"normally i read more fast paced books for my entertainment. it is a good book, and historical, it just wasn't what I had thought it would be. probably just going to see the play/movie instead."
4,surprisingly good read,"I was skeptical at first when I started to read this book, since it is a translation. After the first few pages, I got hooked. Never saw the play or movie..and I keep wondering how they were able to make a musical out of this book. The book has a lot of philosophical thoughts and conversations. A great book to keep you thinking between reads. Great for all ages (as long as you understand some of the language....that is what 's great about a digital copy...you can query the meanings). I also love the detail that the author goes into describing the places, the people in the book....very eloquent."
1,Serious issues,"Noticing that this book was ""Supposedly"" unabridged, I purchased it, only to find that the translation was a mess. There are notable modifications in the translation, the style has been notably changed in a number of places, and the book is too short to be unabridged. A better edition isThe Works of Victor Hugo (with active table of contents), translated by Charles Wilbour. It offers a far better edition of Les Miserables, in addition to a number of other famous works by Hugo, for only 1 dollar more."
5,The Greatest Book In The World!,"Jean Val Jean is the best character. He is so honest and that it hurts your heart to see him put in jail and mistreated. He come down from a high position as Father Madeline to claime that he is Jean Val Jean. He saves an innocent man from being tried as guilty. This is a great work of art, Javert is seen as such a bad man, but in the end that all changes. You have to read this Novel, it is the best there will probably ever be."
5,A Million Stars!,"Fee, Fi, Fo, Fum, Who didn't give LM five stars?! This is probably the best epic ever of life's darkness and the light of the human spirit. I can't even begin to put my thoughts into words whenever I think about this book. I loved the characters in the shadows even better than the main characters, because Hugo is a master at showing the depths of darkness that he means to penetrate with the brilliance of justice and mercy. Hugo does not allow any subject, no matter how insignificant it seems, pass under his keen eye without a full description, history, and life. The result is the most life-filled dystopia ever to thrill multitudes of readers for generations--and the brightest, most stirring utopianism ever."
1,One the World's Worst Books,"How can this poorly written piece of sap be considered a classic? The hopelessly over-sentimental plot and characters made me want to lose my lunch- in this case, the musical beats the book, hands down."
5,Long but worth it.,I love this story. Its hard to ge through but its worth it in the long run - the story really is more than just a simple theatrical play.
3,Hard to read,Hard to read. Can't really get into it. Probably would be better understood in its original language is I only spoke French.
3,Never read it.,I have never read this but it is on my phone in case i get bored and need something to read.
1,WOW it's long,"I thought it would be more like the musical or movie. Something you could read, but as I looked at the table of contents I realized it was HUGE!"
1,Les Miserables,Ugh! Too verbose and dry. Too many details that are not interesting. I will read the Wikepedia version before I see the movie.
3,Not my cup of Tea.,I can't really give a good review to this book. I just don't like this style of writing but I'm sure it is great for others.
5,A great classic!,"I have read this book several times and have always loved it. For some strange reason the tragedy in the story picks me up when I am feeling down. In my opinion, this is a classic that everyone should enjoy.I have the actual book, but loved the idea of having it electronically which led me to purchasing the Kindle version.The movie is now showing in theaters and I can't wait to see this book transformed onto the big screen."
5,Don't let the musical fool you...,"I read this after having seen the musical when it was in town. I love the music. I love the story. I love it all. I bought the book and fell in love all over again. There are a few differences between the musical and the book and that's why the book is so wonderful. Once you get over the inital shock of the length of the book, you will quickly read it because you fall in love with the characters and their trials."
3,Good book,"This book is good but I'm glad I already know the story because like everything Hugo writes, it is superfluous in the description of everything!! After seeing the stage production numerous times and now the current movie, I am glad to be reading this book to understand the differences between those two interpretations and to understand how well the movie really does follow the book."
4,Love it,Don't start this book unless you plan on putting alot of time into it. Although this is an abridged version. I love the story and it is worth the time.
4,Les MIserables by VIctor Hugo,Excellent and well written. The translations in French to English could have been easier to access. Some meaning was lost without this feature. The section about slang was overdone. Excellent theme for all times.
2,I am sure literature teachers love it,"I had to read this in high school...and hated it. After seeing the newest movie, I decided to read it again (50 years after the first read). I will never read another book by Victor Hugo... I wanted to see how the movie tracked with the book, and the tiny bits and pieces chosen for the movie track fairly well, comprising less than the equivalent of a short paperback, while the book is nearly 1,000 pages. That would be fine, but Hugo takes 20 pages to say a rose is red, shoes are worn, etc. But he was a poet. The endless rambling and describing every little detail 40 different ways while using every $100 word in the dictionary quickly becomes torturous."
3,Very long book,"It is very long its over 900 pages. Also if you are a younger person like in middle school or maybe evan your first year in highschool it will make no sense to you at all. I loved I understood it,and it made me keep readind on and on. Though for some people it will be very boring evan if you understand it."
4,Engaging Story,"Briefly, Victor Hugo triumphed in creating meaningful characters in a romantic setting and exhibiting an ability to understand relationships and emotions. He reminds us of what it is to be human and to suffer and forgive and overcome. I couldn't help fall in love with all the characters, for all their flaws and virtues, because they are real. And I'm not much of a weeper, but the chapter that introduced Marius broke my heart. A person would have to be inhuman to feel nothing for this book. My only complaint is that Hugo meanders endlessly and often about minute details--the gold brocade of the bishop's draperies, etc. (We get the picture, Vic.)"
5,This is the best novel in the history of human civilization.,"Les Miserables captures the essential truths of the human soul and spins them into a collection of brillantly executed prose. Victor Hugo's ultimate work of eloquence combines poetry, philosophy, and deep, beautiful imagery in a way which set the standard for all great novels since. This edition captures not only the meaning of this great work, but also the soul stirring language in which Hugo describes the plight of man in conflict with the absolute. It is a piece of literature which belongs in every library, bookshelf, and heart of the world"
5,Les Miserables by Victor Hugo,"I just saw the new movie ""Les Miserables"" and wanted more background. The book is interesting and a good piece of history."
2,Difficult reading.,"I read a version of this in French many years ago and loved it. However, this appears to be a literal translation from the old French and is really difficult to grasp. I do not remember all of the historical detail of the war. I haven't finished it and don't know if I will. I checked after I got it and the translator of another version even commented(without naming names) on the difficulty in reading it. I felt better that it wasn't me. I may purchase another version and hopefully be able to read it."
4,Very readable translation,"While I feel that Hugo could and should have made his prose more succinct, his writing is largely inspired and his social and political commentary is surprisingly still apropos. This translation seems to capture the spirit of the age and writer while remaining readable - not always an easy task. If you are interested in reading an unabridged version, I highly recommend this. If you are looking for a page-turner, I suggest you find a good abridged version."
3,A lot to take on,"I thought I would read the book before seeing the movie because I never really felt I knew what was going on when I have seen the musical. I didn't realize how long it was buying on kindle. I am only about a quarter of the way through and have moved on. I liked it and understand the background much better. I knew to expect misery but without the music the story is much more miserable. That being said, I realize it is a work of literature and not meant to be a light read."
4,Les Mis,I love this book and I am excited to read it again on my kindle so I don't have to carry the huge book around! And the built in dictionary feature is super helpful!
4,les miserables book,"my wife bought this book on my account by mistake, i assumed she bought it because of the reviews it had"
3,Hard to get into,I found the story hard to get into as it is written. I doubt I will continue/complete reading this book.
4,It is an enduring classic and shiuld be,"Hugo certainly knows have to invent, create and introduce characters. This book belongs in everyone's Kindle. It's length is like a great part time job one loves. As I read this classic I can see it as a template by what can happen in America's future. It is must reading and do it slowly. It is that enjoyable."
5,Absolutely memorable,"At mid-life, why did I finally read ""Les Mis""? Because of the ""buzz"" - something I rarely subscribe to - and because a canvass of the great works of world literature dictated I do so.I expected to confront a somewhat labored and overly drawn melodrama, and I did - but one, I found, whose characters are burned into your memory forever. A tremendous story of redemption and commitment, ""Les Mis"" resonates with anyone who loves, or has loved, deeply. Hugo is a storyteller of the first rank. Long after this read is over, you're willing to forgive some contrived coincidences and broad characterizations. Subtle, it isn't; grand, by all means. So I ended up making a leap of faith.And maybe, that's what Hugo had in mind all along with this masterpiece."
3,Be prepared for several hundred pages of social commentary,"I had seen Les Mis on stage twice and also the film. I decided to read the book. While it is excellent in ""filling in the gaps"" and giving continuity to the characters, the interplay of the characters, and explanation of the plot, Victor auto also used this as an opportunity to give extensive social commentary on current day (1860) French politics, religion, and social justice. While this was interesting, it got overwhelming about 400 pages in, actually disrupting the flow of the story. I made it through, but it took me three weeks of hard reading."
2,Les Miserables,"I read this book after seeing the movie, but was disappointed in the book. There is too much detail about each character which rather bored me."
2,Such a hard read,Being a huge fan of the play I have tried many times over the years to read this book & have never been able to finish it. It moves at a very slow pace & is at hard times very hard to follow.
4,Not bad but I prefer it in French!,Good translation. Much better than a recent movie.Some words were translated too literaly! I personally prefer it in French.
4,a great read,the first 58 pages go on forever. after that it is riveting. the back ground stories of the characters are in depth wonderful insites of the human spirit. both good and brutally bad.
3,Les Miserables,Book was very long and only read part of it because I decided to see the movie. Thoroughly enjoyed the story through the movie version.
2,Punctuation would be nice...,"Long meandering book. I heard the author wrote the longest sentence in the history of novels, and I can see that. I understand it's a classic, but the book is more than a little outdated."
5,Phenomenal!,"I love this entire production!! So emotional, glorious voices, beautiful music accompaniment. I can not recommend it enough. It is a classic you will never tire of."
3,books on Kendle,I have been meaning to read this book for a long time have not finished the book -- it downloaded very quickly
2,Abridged and not well translated,"Believe it or don't believe it, but you'll find the chapter on the history of the sewers of Paris quite interesting. The Battle of Waterloo I had to slog through, but I'm still glad I read the entire book.This isn't the best translation of a classic novel."
3,COMPLEX READ,"I find this to be a bit challenging to say the least. The laugauge, even though it is English has been hard for me to follow.I find myself putting it down frequently after just a few pages. Being that it is so long, it will take me forever to finish. One positive I can speak of is it does take you far, far, far away to a land that seems so beautiful that I want to go and see what that side of the world looks like. The characters are also so interesting and descriptive. I will continue my journey with it and I hope to finish it before too long."
1,Hardly a Premium Edition-update,I knew this was a paperback but from the appearance on the product information I thought at almost $30 it would make a nice gift. But in fact it's presentation looks like something that you would expect of a knock off that had been reproduced by a cottage industry. Consider the other selections or look local in used book stores so you can see what you are buying.Up-Date: I shopped at Barnes and Noble where I found a very nice new paper back published by Modern Library for only $18.
5,"Les Miserables---The best commentary on humanity, ever!","I have been a fan of this translation of Les Miserables for many years. In fact, my hard bound copy is lovingly falling apart. I read it just a little at a time to actually savor what is being said about not only the political climate of the early 19th century but about humanity in general.There have been many criticisms over the years: The book goes off on tangits, the plot is too contrived and confused, and, for people like my mother, just too depressing. Some people still have the audacity to think it is set during the French Revolution. (I shudder still thinking about it.) Personally with this translation I can feel the power of the human spirit, the glorious redemption of Jean Valjean, the heart-breaking life of Eponine, and the utter failure of the students at the barricade. Give it time, give it patience and you will enjoy this tale."
3,It's Okay.,"A little hard to follow, but still o.k. I have been re-reading many older (""classic"") books and this one isn't my favorite, but since it has been getting hew hype because of the movie release, I thought, ""why not""."
5,Very moving,V E R Y M O V . I N G I RECOMMEND to people who can sit down and pay attention to a book
5,Good to follow the movie,I just saw the recent movie and enjoyed it. It was well done. I wanted to follow up with the book to discover the nuances.
2,ahhh,"I downloaded this and I am not a fan, it's nothing to do with the seller, just didn't like this version of the book"
2,Heavy Duty,"This historical read is the most extreme thing I have ever tried to make it through. The description of battles, convents, and sub-characters, just goes on and on and on. I ended up skipping a lot of pages to find the story that I was familiar with from the movie. If you want to spend large amounts of time understanding Paris's history, then this is the book for you."
2,Boring,"I thought this book was a little boring, it went into so much detail about what each person wore and the surroundings it took a while to getinto the story"
2,hard to read,"It is very hard to understand, quit reading it already. wouldnt recomment it. Not consistent with the play or movie"
2,It is truly MISERABLE!,"I was excited to read this book before going to the new movie. So far as i read, the story was dull, but the movie is absolutely depressing!I don't understand why so many people think this is a great story.I appreciated the opportunity to get on on my Kindle."
5,Spiritually uplifting,It is rare in the day and time to find something truly worth reading. Victor Hugo has written a novel that affirms the sacrifice of one person for the love and well-being of another. It is a long book. But there is a lot of positive notes along the way
3,A Very Old story,"To be honest, I did not read this book as I went to see the movie and did not want to spoil that."
5,A Beautiful Story,Victor Hugo has carefully crafted a great book. A life story for every character is completely and carefully detailed..
2,Review of Les Miserables,I can not seem to get into it. The book is disjointed and does not seem to flow from one chapter to another.
5,Emotionally Staggering,"1432 pages and still a page-turner. This is beyond a shadow of a doubt the best book I have ever read. The character development starts out a little vague, but develops into broad sweeping palettes with exquisite detail.Jean Valjean is likely the most famous character in all of literature. There are times when it seems as though Hugo is deliberately trying to run a stiletto of pain directly up the spinal canal of the reader. The trials and tribulations of Cosette go to the point where I had the intense desire to tear this book in half. There were times I had come to actually despise this book.The level of emotion Hugo evokes is staggering. The reader is helpless before his mastery. By the end of the novel I was enraptured and in tears.That this work is pure fiction from the mind of one man is beyond imagining. You cannot count yourself a true scholar if you have not read Les Miserables in the unabridged translation."
5,Stunning,"I started the unabridged version of Les Miserables with some fear, because I don't think of myself as the sort of person who likes to read giant classics. Almost immediately, I was hooked.The novel is often intensely suspenseful, and sometimes slow -- but when it's slow, it's not boring. Among other things, Hugo offers an extremely rich (and in some ways comically opinionated) portrait of French culture and politics in the early 19th century.If you don't like the sound of that portrait, an abridged version of the novel might be appealing to you, since I'm guessing it's the cultural/historical commentary that gets cut out. I loved that stuff though -- it absolutely deepened the story for me. In fact, I recommend that rather than buying an abridged version, you get the unabridged version and then just skip whatever you don't like (I read the Penguin Classics edition, by the way)."
3,"Fair plot and characters, but too lengthy and descriptive","I enjoyed the book's main plot, and all the characters were thoughourly developed, but the book is too long and way too much description. Maybe I don;t like it because I was FORCED to read it for English... It also gives a realistic feeling of the harsh social status in France 19th-century, which I thought was interesting."
4,good reading,Good classic book. Enjoyed the time reading it and then seeing the movie. Take the time to read a book.
4,Good read but sometimes tedious,"Hugo goes overboard on the detail at times to develop the characters and the setting for events. But overall I am enjoying the book. It has valuable moral lessons and it has captured me with the emotion of the story. It's very long, though, and I'm not even half the way through."
2,Hard for me to stay interested,Was written in a very descriptive way and sometimes I lost the plot while reading the 20 pages of description. I also realize it was a translated book so maybe that was the problem
3,I liked the book ok,"It is more wordy than I expected and has a more political slant than what is portrayed in the play and musical. It is still good to read the original, but I discovered I liked what the rewrites had done more."
3,Kindle buyers beware...,"The kindle download of this novel by Mobilereference seems to be a different, and worse, translation than the Signet Classics edition. Please note (or fix) this Amazon!"
1,Do not buy this version!,"Re: Les Miserables.This abridged version is riddled with typos which makes it extremely hard to read. For example, Page 7: Pbudence; Pg 9, The Heroism op Passive Obedience; Pg 19, Petit Gebvai8; Pg 22: To Entkust. These I saw just scanning through quickly. This is a very poor product!In case the link doesn't work for some reason, the front cover has Les Miserables, Victor Hugo on a tan background. The inside title page has Les Miserables, Victor Hugo and Mead Schaeffer, General Books, www.General-Books.net. 391 pages."
3,"Book was really two books written as one. Much, too much information for one book.","The authors knowledge of history is prodigious, story line was exciting, but much too much verbage regarding the history of the times."
3,Hard Reading,"Old writing with alot of wording...not what I enjoy. Love the story and screenplay, anxious to buy DVD when available."
3,not bad,"The book in kindle version is a little boring to read, I excepted a more friendly and colorful edition. Hope other kindle books are better."
2,Les Miserables,"I just feel the beginning has too many names,words that our extremely long and confusing. I plan on seeing the film and then return to reading. I haven't read very far into the book but it is frustrating to me as I can't keep up with all the characters. Perhaps, seeing the film will help"
4,Good Book,A very good read. Keeps my interest. It is nice to read about a great man in this day and time.
2,Les Miserables,This book was totally different from the movie and I had a hard time getting into it. I never finished it.
3,Not so excellent condition,"The cover was very worn and there were highlighting marks throughout the book. Still, for the price it was fine. I was just a bit disappointed."
5,Best book ever,"I have long been a fan of Victor Hugo and of this work and can never get enough of it. It is much better to read the book than say watching the movies or listening to the musical soundtrack. One of the things that I love about reading the book is how all the characters are interrelated somehow. This is a lengthy work, but well worth the time invested in reading it."
1,Here is my evaluation.,I really have no opinion at this time. Started book but due to daily life interruptions I have been unable to rate this product fairly.
2,Too little information,"Haven't purchased this edition, but it is half the length of the unabridged editions I've seen, so a lot must have been cut. And therefore, it is NOT ""complete"". And there is no indication of who the translator is. I suspect this is a 19th century now-public-domain translation that is being reprinted by someone, but there are several.Pretty cover, though."
3,Haven't Read,"From all the media about it I thought I ""should"" read this but frankly am not to interested. Possibly in the future.....Lois"
2,reading,It was not the story line of the movie. I made a mistake in ordering this book but I guess it was to late to change order.
3,My review of Les Miserables,It is slow going because of the language. Difficult to read because it's language like 100 yrs ago. Weird. Haven't gotten very far and doubt I will finish.
2,reading not good,i did not care for this book to me it didn't make much sense or maybe it just didn't interest me
5,Victor Hugo,"This is a real classic, enjoyable read which offers so much more to the story than what you see in the movies. If you are looking for a big long read, who hates to see stories end too quickly, a story to loose yourself in and put you to sleep, then I highly recommend this book."
3,the book was very inviting,"the play was not as good as the book. It took me by surprise on what its actually about, thanks to my daughter"
5,Quick Delivery,I got this on my android. It was almost instant and I got it for free! You can't fail with amazon!
3,So-So,Not a type of book that holds my interest for much time. I'm sure it is a well written book but not for me.
3,Long,Dude this is friggin long . Jeeez. Ok I thought Harry potter was long this is all most 1000 pages . ( the size of an eighth grade English textbook in Louisiana) I would know
3,a long novel,"Known as probably the longest novel written and I can see why. With all the hype over the stage show and imminant release of the film I thought I should read it. This is the second time I have attemped to read this novel. Found it alot easier to read on my kindle than book form. Really enjoyed the story line with Jean Valjean ,Fantine and Cosette but found his side issues like Waterloo and closed religeous orders rather tedious and spoilt it for me. But this could just be that i,m too thick to appreciate classic literature."
3,Les Miserables,"I can tell from the first page that this is going to be tedious reading, translations always are. I will read it as it is a classic, good for the winter doldrums?"
2,Les Miserables,"I couldn't read it. Knocked off trying after chapter 6. Too verbose for me. In saying that, I recognised the author's ability and claim to fame!Stuart Pemberton"
3,New to Ebooks,So far so good. Easy to access and read. I had no problem acquiring the book. I look forward to reading the other books I downloaded.
4,I like it,"I really havn't had a chance to read it yet on my kindal, but it reads well. I hope to read it soon."
4,heavy reading but oh so well crafted...,"am enjoying reading it. easy to understand why its a classic. Yet the human souls illuminated in this book, suffer the same challenges that we do today. buy it and enjoy it."
4,A reader's must,"If you are an avid reader, this is a must have. The details of writing paint such splendid pictures of the times. You will not have to wonder what Paris was like because Victor goes into great detail. If you are a leisurely reader, this book will be a good read. If you are a non reader, this book will drive you crazy. I enjoyed it more after I saw the movie."
5,Les Mis - c'est magnifique!,"""Les Miserables"" is written so well I can't put it down. I plan to read ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" after I finish ""Les Miserables"". This is real literature. I'm so glad I have finally discovered Victor Hugo."
3,dnt see the film before you read this.,...and by that time it will be on DVD. just Hugo at his most poetic (but sometimes long winded) and a joy to digest.
5,Great book!,A beautiful story. Jean Valjean is pretty much my hero. The paperback edition has shown some wear in only the first time reading it.
2,Les Mis,I just cannot get into this book. I have attempted reading it over and over and just cannot get into it.
4,Very good,"I simply love this book. It is a masterpiece of world's literature. The formatting is OK, even if I would prefer to see the text justified."
5,Best of the Best in Classics,Les Miserables is France immortalized and Victor Hugo is one of the greatest things to ever happen to Paris. This edition is the complete edition in every sense and I highly recommend to people to buy this edition if you really want the whole feel of the story. 19th century France comes to life in the words of a man who loved it dearly. Classic French Literature. Victor Hugo romances France just like he does in all his works. If you haven't read Les Miserables yet; read it; and buy a copy of this edition of it.
2,Sorry,"I couldn't get through it, was very boring. Just not my kind of book I guess. I'm sure there are readers out there who would enjoy it!"
5,Classic,This story was well written and keeps the reader wanting to keep reading to the end! Always a great classic!
5,Good read,Wonderful book it captures your interest right away and bring you to the climax of the story breathless. I would highly recommend this to anyone.
3,Beautiful historical novel!,A wonderful story filled with unforgettable characters and detailed scenery. It argues the for the wrong in what is thought to be right and for the right in what is thought to be wrong.
3,My Opinion,I thought it was an ok read. I felt it left a lot unsaid and had some questions still rolling around in my head.
2,Original Victor Hugo writing--hard to read,"Too hard to read and nothing like the movie, musical, etc. I think this is the original written version and is hard to understand."
5,Wonderfully written,The excruciating detail about the characters is what makes this book great. I have thoroughly enjoyed reading every Hugo book.
4,Classic read,"Read it years ago, classic literature. One of the many classics that everyone should read just to acquaint themselves with different styles of literature."
4,Good Read,I have plans to see the movie so reading the story first was the plan. I would recommend this even if you have seen the movie.
1,It is OK,I personally do not enjoy the readings of this time period. It was to hard for me to follow and enjoy.
1,hard to read,"This book was a hard to follow book. I personally would not recommend it. However, I have heard the movie is wonderful."
5,"le mis, how can you miss?","Have always wanted to read this book. Love Victor Hugo, but for some reason, never tackled this book. Now, glad I did. Don't let what non-literary people say about a book scare you away from it. Look at Moby Dick, wonderful."
4,My review,I like the story of Les Mis It is a classic story and a good one. I have never read the book.
3,Les Miserables,"A long and complex book. The actual story of the main characters is very good but hard to follow because of Victor Hugo's excursions into the political and philosophical aspects of France's History at this time. It would be great if there were 2 books, one being the fictional story and the other the non fiction."
1,book,I didn't like it any better than when I had to read it in high school. I'm not into that type of reading.
3,The book was good,"I am not a devotee of electronic books, but this was convienent to read on my tablet. The mechanics of reading in this format are pretty good."
1,Les miserables,"I did not like this book at all. I would. Not suggest. Anyone read it. The writing of the author was strange, in my opinion."
5,Great,"A book for all times and all tastes.Be smart, read it!, you wouldn't regret.have a thesaurus with you."
3,Doesn't read smoothly,Because of the translation into English it is a bit choppy ... ... ... ... ... .. .. .. -
2,Not for me,Could not get into the book at all and the way it was written. Too formal for me.i will see the movie
4,Awesome,This is a great book. I would recommend it to anyone. I haven't seen the movie yet but anxious to after reading this wonderful book.
5,Beautiful,"Being a 19 year old male college student, its difficult to say that I have experienced true heartbreak, misery, or despair. After finishing Les Miserables, I felt almost like an expert on life. Victor Hugo does an extraordinary job of emotionally attaching the reader to each of the characters. As the reader, you experiance first hand the misery of Thenardier, the heartbreak of Marius, and the sacrfices of Jean Valjean. Beyond the attachment you will feel, the story is incredible. I will say though that the size of the book is intimidating and there are some parts that seem pointless, but after you finish the book, you will realize it was worth it. Its hard to explain in words how I felt reading this book. I can say after reading the last two pages, my body had goosebumps and I almost had tears in my eyes. Beautiful."
3,Great for some not for everyone,"I found Hugo to be at his best with developing great characters, providing insights into human nature and what's going on in people's minds, and telling a story when the plot is moving forward. Having said that, He is really long winded and gives detailed descriptions of things, like buildings, that have very little to do with the story. The preface even tries to excuse him for that saying that what is no longer customary in level of detail used to be the norm. I found myself skimming these long descriptions to pick up the plot again. In doing that I was able to not just finish this very long book but to enjoy it as well."
4,Well-known and Welcome,"I have not read this book as yet because I'm saving it for a trip to Mexico which Will be taken soon. However, I did read the story several years ago in a Lit class and have seen the recent movie so I know the book will be enjoyable reading and I will find details missed or not used earlier."
2,The Miserables,"If ever there were a classic in need of a fresh translation, this is it. Although quite amusing to see ""formidable"" translated as ""formidable""."
5,Reading it after the movie,Looking forward to reading this because I enjoyed the movie so much. I knew nothing about this show before I went.
4,purchased,"I saw the play and liked it so much, decided to purchase this book. Still haven't gotten to read it yet so really don't have a good comment......"
4,Les Miserables,Excellent clean reading. It was sometimes hard to understand and that is why I didn't give it five stars. Overall it was great.
2,not for me..,Sorry did not get very far into this book. xvbxcvb xvb xvcb xcv xvb xvbb xvb xvb xvb xvb xv.
4,To the Barricades!,"This is a very slow read. Its rhythm, while slow, is pleasant. I found it a pleasing book to read while we were having a blizzard and I could enjoy it with multiple cups of (de-caf) coffee. Like many of the Russian canon, this is not a book to be causally recommended as it is too long. The brilliance of the choices made and acted upon in the Broadway version are remarkable. I haven't seen the film, and will stay with the book for now."
4,Les Miz,It's a classic and wonderful but like all novels of it's time it is very lengthy.I would recommend it highly
3,Translation,"The translation from French must have been an enormous task. Unfortunately there are some bad translating choices (e.g. you for the formal ""vous"" and thou for the familiar ""tu""). Other than that, congratulations to the translators!"
4,Love this on my kindle for Ipad,Fast downloading and item as described. I am pleased with my purchase. Thanks for making this order possible. Will do again in the future.
4,Les Miserables (English version),"I was looking for a good read - and I also wanted to preparemyself for the upcoming movie version of Les Miserables.You have to be able to read way more details than you might want to,but the writing is powerful."
3,Long beginning...!,I have just started reading the part when Jean Valjean is introduced and enjoying the book much more than the entire intro about the Bishop of D--!
5,great story,"Very much beloved story, great play, even greater book. a great read, you will laugh, cry and be inspired by the redemption of Jean Valjean."
1,not Les Mis,"I don't know what was up, but the Kindle free version I got was not Les Mis but something totally different."
1,"Miserable story, setting, characters and writing.","Why is this garbage deemed a classic? It is thoroughly miserable, I give it that. A depressing look at the futility in being a cop enforcing the ruling class's laws on the poor and even middle-class like here in the US."
4,Book Reviews,I have not read this book yet. I purchased the book as heard that it was very good. I will be reading it as soon as a finish current book reading.
3,les miserables,"at this time I cannot give an accurate review, because I have been busy...but I will be glad to add additional info when I am able to read this product. Thanks for the free reads."
2,Excruciatingly long-winded,"War & Peace seemed 1000 pages too short. This book, unfortunately seemed 1000 pages too long. Victor, do we really need 4 full chapters about the sewers of Paris and the poetic side of excrement? And are we really supposed to believe that of all the thugs, thieves, murderers and other scoundrels haunting Paris, the one guy Inspector Javert is really intent on capturing is the guy who stole a loaf of bread 20-30 years before? Yeah, I get it--the French legal system was unfair, but c'mon--this is ridiculous."
3,Les Miserables,"This a really great book about social and political life in 19th-century France. I would not dare to compare Hugo with Dickens, but somehow that idea might creep into the mind of the reader. The story is poignant, dramatic, raising some important ethical and universal questions on human development and societal justice. Hugo's talent is undeniable, although his narrative may be classified as a bit historically slanted, allegedly. The English version is worth applauding indeed, as it reveals the challenges of interpreting from French; whereas both languages boast their long history, a lot in common in terms of Latin origin, notwithstanding their own unique development and evolvement. For a linguistic researcher, such parallels need noting."
4,Finally got into the story!,"I just could not be bothered to sit through the play. Oh, I know it got rave reviews, but ugh! At least the book made a bit more sense. Even though this is not my genre for reading enjoyment, I found this book bearable, and interesting enough to continue turning the pages."
4,"Good book, but difficult","Great story, but long and a lot of words. It took a while to get to the real story, but it took off from there."
1,no,"don't buy this one! i deleted it once i had it, as it was just facts about the time period and not the story."
3,Deep,It is hard for me to get into this book. I have just now found a little about the main character. Maybe a better review later.
3,The book Les Miserables,I am still working my way through this book. I wanted to read the book before seeing the movie. So far no connection to any of the movie trailers I have seen. Beginning of the book focusing on a Bishop is a very poor city. I will keep working on the book but the movie will probably have to wait until its on DVD. I will update later.
3,Les Mis,"I am still reading the book so can't give full review...so far it's good, as I expected it to be."
2,Depressing (especially during an election cycle),I wanted to read this story before the movie musical came out. I knew that it was sad but I did not realize how DEPRESSING it is. The world is not such a dark and nasty place. Most folks aren't evil or selfish.
5,A marvelous read,"This book is one of my favorite books of all time. I had the abridged version brought to my attention, but opted for the unabridged translation, and oh, the wonder of it all. I have read literally thousands of books, but this and the King James Version of the Bible are my two favorite books to read when I want to remind myself of the true meaning of charity, forgiveness, and love."
5,A wonderful and elegant book!,"Les Miserables is one of my favorite books. I recommend it for any one over the age of 13. It has some difficult reading, but overall, it is excellent. A great buy! A wonderous investment!"
5,There are no words...,"I first heard of this story from my youth director at church. She has been a great role model to me and so I took her advice. Little did I know how much this book would inspire me so much and also be an even greater role model. It amazes me how Victor Hugo was able to capture every character so deeply and bring forth similar feelings that we upon reading this book, had never even realized we too possess. Being 14 years old, my friends laughed at me a bit when they saw the thickness of this book, yet it only made me realize that it doesn't matter how many words it takes to bring something across - as long as it is the truth. And that is exactly what this book is. It gave me quite a wake-up call into how life unfortunatly really is, and greater insight and strenghth in my faith. As the quote among the first pages of this book stated,""...so long as ignorance and misery remain on earth, there should be a need for books such as this."""
4,Classic,"I wanted to read this before seeing the movie and hadn't read it in school for some strange reason. I must admit that the descriptive nature of Hugo's writing was very tedious for me, I kept thinking ""ok ok I get it, now move on!"""
3,nice background,"Loved how the book flushed out characters from seeing the movie or musical. Too much detail about peripheral events. Story should be about the characters, lessen the background."
5,Love it!,"I watched the movie, Lea Miserables, a couple of weeks ago. I wanted to recall the story as the original version. It was a good choice. I can definitely say that it is one of my favorite novels."
3,1000 pages,"This is hard going, but I am glad to be able to compare it with the play and movies. The formal prose is trying my patience."
4,Keeps getting Bette,"While I've read other books by Victor Hugo the length of Les Miserables has kept me away from it. However the Broadway production and now the movie have told me it's time to read it. The play brought wonderful music to the story; the movie helped me understand the plot better; the book brings rich character descriptions and Hugo's wonderful phraseology of his philosophy. This book is long past copyright laws so there are numerous copies available for free. Although it's still awfully long, I highly recommend it."
3,Les Miserables,It was very complicated and hard to follow - too many details. I wanted to read it before seeing the movie. The movie was wonderful and the book did give me some understanding even though I never finished reading it.
3,Avid Reader,"Download this because the movie just came out, I wanted to read the book first. Difficult read, slow to get started."
5,Simply incredible,"""Les Miserables"" is the greatest piece of literature ever written, hands down. I read the book when I was 13 and enjoyed it as much as a 13 year old could. I finished rereading it again today, 11 years later. Now that I have 11 years more experience with world literature, I can stand by my original assessment of the novel: it is simply brilliant. Hugo's characterizations are unparalleled. No one who reads the book could forget Valjean's spiritual awakening and the deep sacrafice made at the end, Javert's relentless pursuit of Valjean and what happens to him when he finds his belief system is fallible to say the least, Marius and Cosette's love, Thernadier's scheming, Enjolras' spark of leadership, Eponine's pathetic state, or Gavroche's kindness to his brothers and fearless death scene. The images and themes will continue to haunt me throughtout my life, and I look forward to reading the book again in 10 years and seeing how age will change it again."
1,Les Miserable by Victor Hugo - E Book,Unfortunately this book was sent wirelessly (probably my error when ordering) and I do not have Wi Fi and did not receive it - so the rating is not derogatory to the book as I am unable to rate it. I am hoping that when I am able to connect to Wi Fi it will come through.
1,TOTAL GARBAGE,Made it to page 37 before deleting this worthless verbose book off my Kindle... Made absolutely no sense and is boring as all hell!
4,nice,"I'm never gonna read this, but wanted to have it anyway just because of the size ! Great condition, and my favorite story ! Just don't want to read it myself."
4,ONE OF THE HIDDEN VALUES OF THE KINDLE,"I HAVEN'T FINISHED THIS NOVEL, BUT IT IS ONE OF THE VALUES OF KINDLE..IT COST ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO BUY THIS MASTERPIECE"
3,miserable book,"this book is very hard to read. Does not grab your attention, seems to drag on. I read several chapters & set it aside, will give up & go see the movie instead. I didn't read this in school"
1,Don't waste your time!,I thought I would try this book since I usually love all book to movie types and now that it's a movie..... ha... I couldn't get pasted the boring first page.
5,Lovely,One of the best books I've ever read. It's sure to find a home on my bookshelf in the future.
4,great on kindle,glad to be able to get this on my kindle and not have to lug around a huge book -- hopefully it won't take me forever to read it love the movie and musical - curious to find out what was not included in those venues
2,Les Miserables - Victor Hugo,"I love the musical but not the long-length book. Ordered by mistake, but fine since it is free. Thank you!"
3,Not finished reading,I am not anywhere close to the end of this book. I believe it is over 900 pages and is not an easy read. (Lots of French/English terms) as that is the period in which it takes place. I'm hoping it will become more interesting because I don't want to give up on it yet.
2,Les Miserables,"Very wordy A detailed view of life in 2860""s France. Too much for me. See the movie. Better yet see the play,which is coming to the movies."
5,It's good to describe the life of poor,"I cried when I read this book. I sympathized the poor's life became hard to live for money and was pursued anyone who is crediter, because I also poor. But I decided to live like Jean Valjean rather than a schemer and also want to resemble Father's life could give anything what is important to me. This is the book call me what I have to do for being a human, and why I have to live Jean's life for satisfaction my life."
5,Timeless Classic,"Timeless Classic that speaks for itself. I read this in Highschool, about 15 years ago, and wanted to re-read with the hype of the new movie that came out last year. It was well worth revisiting the storyline and the characters. A must read, indeed!"
2,Reading this book made me miserable,"It may be a good movie, I will never know. I tried to get into the book at least 8 times and failed. So much so, that I gave up. It may be just me, but the style of writing and the storyline was boring and did not grab my attention in the slightest."
4,Still reading,I really do like it but it will take a while for me to finish. I don't want to miss a thing.
5,Quality of Kindle version is perfect,"I won't comment on the quality of the book or even the translation, since I'm not qualified. The kindle version is free, the font is legible, and the story makes perfect sense. Enjoy it!"
1,Heavy going,"It is interesting at times but then wanders off and is a bit hard to keep track of, I am afraid i gave up. I had been reading it for days and my Kindle said i had only read 5%!!!!"
5,My 3rd time to read Les Miserables-still loving it!,"I saw the Broadway Musical in 1990 at the Imperial Theatre in New York City. I fell in love with the musical, first because I'm a musician; the book in its unabridged form, filled in the ""gaps"" Cameron MacIntosh couldn't stage for sake of time. My favorite characters are ""Fantine"" (for her selflessness toward Cosette), and Gavroche, the little ""gamin""/street urchin. The details of Waterloo are something I've yet to get through quickly, but once that is done, it is much easier to understand Thenardier and Marius' roles in Hugo's novel. This is epic in its scope-it brings forward problems all humanity faces. Like the Bible, one can't read this book without being changed, inwardly. This is my 3rd time to read the book; there will be a 4th."
4,"Beautiful, but old-fashioned and long-winded story","Over the past couple of weeks I've been reading Les Miserables by Victor Hugo. I wanted to read it before the movie came out (11th of January 2013 in Ireland), and just managed to do it. (I read the free Kindle edition).Let me begin by saying that the story of Les Miserables is timeless, and I think everyone should get to know it one way or another.When that is said however, I probably wouldn't recommend the book to most people. I can't speak for the French, I'm sure the original is more beautiful than the translation. However, the style or writing is very old-fashioned, and incredibly drawn out. To be honest, I skimmed through about a quarter of the book - chapter upon chapter about the battle at Waterloo - almost completely unrelated to the story at hand- was just too much for me.There is a lot of beauty in the book though, and the story is as relevant today as ever."
5,how the French were polarized and Napoleonic dream lost through only a few generations,"The proud nation had stringent laws with disproportinate penaltiy for petty offense illustrated in the case of Jean Valjean, the victim of the system. Fearing to be identified and returned to the galley, he became so humble and passive as to be at the mercy of the most advanced of scheming and blackmail and threat of exposure. One love was left to him - Cosette - yet even she was kept away from him - by a jealousworthless lover who relented only too late; the ultimately high-minded man of great physical strength expired and passed to the realm of the angels, divested of the will to save himself.Victor Hugo was a writer who detailed both sides of each dilemma and his use of vocabulary appropriately fits to clarify his point.At times the writng becomes repetitive and the reading is tedious. Such, however, is the price extracted for this experience of the writng of this literary seer, a genius of his time."
2,Did not like,Can't say too much except I didn't like. I would not rcmmend but I'm sure smeone else would like it.
5,Excellent Book for a Beginner,"I'm new to Microsoft Project. I checked several books and settled on this one. I've used the Step-by-Step series before. This is by far the most detailed and correct that I've not only seen of the series, but for learning how to use Project. It's an excellent reference for day-to-day use and covers the steps extremely well. There may be books out there for the more advanced user, but this one is the best I've seen for a beginner."
4,Project 1-2-3,This is a very good beginner to more advanced MS Project book. The many examples and labs help both the novice and more advanced Project user to become more proficient with the tool. Our local PMI Chapter uses this book to teach MS Project to our members and we have gotten very good feedback from out students on how thorough the book is. I would recommend it to anyone who uses MS Project.
2,Shortchanged,I ordered 5 of these manuals. I only received 3. The manuals I did receive was in good condition.
1,Missing Material,"Book was OK but the disc was missing, don't these guys check their stock before shipping?"
2,not satisfied,"The book was required text for a course I am taking and the cd that came with this book did install on my computer, I got a replacement cd and it did not install. So to me buying the book was a waste of time and money."
3,Not pertinent to my original subject matter.,I will be returning this book as it has nothing to do with the Visio software program. I was led to believe that the two books worked together.Thank you.Diana P. Santana
5,MS Project Guide,I needed to learn MS Project fast! This is a great reference guide with a CD that allows you to do hands-on projects. Great tool!
1,Do not buy the ebook edition!!!,"The cd-rom that have all of the cool examples and case studys are not downloaded with the book. So in other words, you can shorted. Buyer beware!!"
4,Good to Start With,"Covers the basics very good.However, not very comprehensive. OK as a first book in this field."
4,Great!,The book is very user friendly and also comes with MS Projects software with it. Very easy to follow and learn. I recommend to user without much prior knowledge.
4,Oh baby,"A timely classic done in fun way. Showed the ""genteel white slavery in the old south"". Had watched this movie years ago but did not regret watching it again."
4,Still bought it again,"I had the pirate version of this movie in movie file for a long time. In my country it was never been released.I always wanted to own properly in DVDIt is a good eye candy movie.I am not a freak who wants to see little girl's naked body and,... so on..I personally think her nudity is pure beautiful. It's an art.About the censorship roumer.My pirate version was not censored one. This one is just the same with the pirate version, so you don't have to worry about that. It's all there.No more comment.So I decided to own in a DVD with a little high price paid."
1,don't order,They edited & deleted scenes from the original version. Don't oder if you want the original movie you might have to get vhs i don't know if there's a dvd out thats unedited.
3,amazing what they got away with,"I've only ever watched this movie when it came out on cable so naturally all the naughty bits were edited out, but upon watching this uncut version I'm amazed how much of it WASN'T cut! I mean, they show baby-Brooke Shields nude from the waste up and also her backside which I was amazed they got away with. All-in- all, the acting was terrible and cheesy but it made the movie like it softened the shock of the whole underlying story the film presents= little girl growing up in brothel at turn of the century America, then turns into prostitute herself at age 11/12."
3,Pretty Baby,I think this is one of Malle's best movie I've ever seen.I saw it when it opened while I was living in New York and I always wanted to get a copy of it and I was lucky that it was still available in DVD.
2,Very depressing,"It was hard to watch a Mother who lived the life as a hooker take pride in the deflowering of her 12 yr old daughter for money. There was an actual party for this occasion.I guess if that's the life you are living back in the day, it was ok to past the life style to your child.To me, I would only want more for my child."
1,Should not have been made into a movie,"Very upsetting movie, shouldn't have been made into a movie, couldn't watch entirely as it disgusted me, through it in the rubbish."
3,Disappointing,I was hoping for a story that would make me think; like Lolita. This was a disappointing movie. It was porely shot and there is a feeling that it was made by an amateur. The characters have no real depth and the acting is sub-par.
4,Clásica!,"No puede faltarte en la colección.No es una película herótica si tomás en cuenta de que actua una niña de 10 años, más bien explora un sub-mundo insólito que es una terrible realidad."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A movie set in a brothel (or directed by Louis Malle) can never be boring, but Pretty Baby doesn't really have a plot or characters interesting enough to drive a film; an interesting failure perhaps, but a failure nonetheless."
3,Pretty Baby,"Pretty BabyIn response to A Customer, I bought Pretty Baby last week and I don't know when or where you purchased your copy, but mine is not censored. Brooke Shields, Who was probably around 11 at the time was shown nude from the waist up and behind when shes locked out of the house and was shown completely nude in one of the photographs Keith Carradine is taking of her. Now I'm no prude, I was only 10 years old when this film came out and had wondered for years what all the fuss was about and I must say that I was a little shocked at the nudity of this small child. The film could not be made today, it would be considered child pornography. After all the fuss that was made about the film Hounddog with Dakota Fanning, Which I thought was a hauntingly sad film told in a tasteful matter I have only one thing to say : watch Pretty Baby if you want to see children exploited on film. Otherwise i thought Pretty Baby was a good movie, but how did they get away with the underage nudity???"
3,Pretty Baby!!!,"I will had put 3 and 1/2 for this movie. The movie had a good atmophere, it sure was different. The story is good but a bit disturbing. Brooke Shields act very good for her age but she get on my nerves with her attitude but that's how she was suppose to act so she was very good. I think for such a young girl we should not had seen her naked, the movie didn't need to see her, a young kid/teenager naked, well I think no movie should put up kids naked. All the cast are good. It's a okay movie but maybe a bit disturbing!"
3,Brooke's first catwalk,"New Orleans...1916, a house of prostitution which raises young girls to become hookers as soon as they turn 12...and Violet (Brooke) wants to become one too. She is ""falls in love"" with a photographer & marries him. What else happens? Watch & find out."
2,interesting movie but....,Too much poor editing to make this a good movie and the subject matter is sick.
2,Pretty Baby,"Was hoping for a bit more with some pretty well know actor's. Cinamatography was excellent, sound was quite well done, but the story line definitely lacked spark.Not recommended."
4,1st Review,"This CD is a collection of 10 good straight-forward tunes with a nice mix of styling attitudes from each of the songs; from a reggae beat in ""Tickin' away"", to a bit of a harder edge on ""Think about me"", there are some catchy melodies on the disc, and some great lyrics. My favorites would probably have to be ""Honestly"", ""I'm not telling"", and ""Apparition"" (which also has a nice piano part added). The CD is also produced well, and sounds good on a variety of sound systems. I bought it, and am glad I did so. Good job guys!"
4,A nice surprise!,"Hey I have to let you know I just happen to stumble across this paticular cd totally by accident.I was hoping this focus album was the proper cd I was looking for. But it wasn't, fortunatly for me. Dudes and Dudettes if you like bands like hootie and matchbox 20, and three eleven this is a must have for your collection.What a refreshing sound. I think this cd will please lots of the descriminate music buffs. I really recommend this one."
3,Does the job,"It took some getting used to the wood handle, but I've grown to love it. I rated it 3 stars only because I've found that the tanto blade isn't really practical for me. I typically use pocket knives to open netflix envelops, letters, and such. There isn't much of a straight edge on the knife because of the space taken by the tanto tip so it takes extra effort to keep your slice on the straight edge. Other than that, it's a great knife. It's a little bigger than I expected so when it's deployed it's quite the eye catcher."
3,Easy to break?,"We use these because they are the only ones sold in the stores around here. I have found that they can be quite difficult to break apart..they aren't scored all the way through. Once you get them broken however, they start fires beautifully."
1,Buy an off brand,Junk! This product is difficult to light and will not stay lit in my wood burning stove. Tried Kroger brand and they worked MUCH better.
5,"long-burning, Easy to break apart","I've been using these the past few weeks. I like to break off 2 small chunks to start 2-3 pieces of dense BEAR Bricks. This makes a great fire for very little money.You can get the Fire Starter for about $14 and a box may well last more than a year. True Value Hardware sells cases of the Bear Bricks for just $3.99. The combo is easy, doesn't take much storage space, and a very good deal, especially compared to the 3 & 5 pound Duraflame and Pine Mountain Logs I also use at $3 or more each. All will get you a comfy, easy 3 hour fire."
4,Ballast sensitive to cold conditions,"I purchased this particular item to use in my garage workshop. Unfortunately the garage is not heated when I am not working out there. The light must be sensitive to the cold. After I turn on the heat, it is often to cold for the lamp to come on. After allowing the heat to rise, the lamp will light and works fine. I will just have to plan my work better and only require the lighted magnifier only after the furnace has done its job. Outside of the cold the magnifier works fine. Thank you for being willing to take the light in exchange for another light."
3,OK for the price,"This product is OK for the price you pay, but typical of all Chinese produced things, the workmanship is only fair at best. The lamp/magnifier swivel hardware was installed upside down and I had to disassemble and reverse it before the head would work at all. The clamp part of it with the cheezy knob adjustment (a poor attempt at copying the excellent Lux lamp method) does not function at all. I simply replaced it with a through bolt and lock nut. If you need a lamp for simple desktop illumination and occasionally need the magnifier, this will probably suit your needs. Next time, I'll pay the extra and get a better one."
5,Great Product & Great Service,Shipping was quick and I find the product to be superb thus far. The light is bright and the magnification plentiful. I would highly recommend it.
4,works well,Better than expected; priced right; probably as good as is necessary for anything except long-term industrial use.
3,Good Enough for what I needed.,The fram around the glass was plastic as was much more than I had expected but it's a fine lamp and sturdy enough.
4,Works for its purpose,Had to finally buy this item after making it 3/4 the way though my finance class and then realized it is a must have. Makes solving time value of money problems a joke. Would get 5 stars but ordered mine used through amazon warehouse and it came without a cover sadly but doesn't affect the function so no need to complain.
4,Sound Calculator,This was a sound buy. I purchased it and it was easy to program and find accurate solutions for a finance project.
5,Calculator,I recently purchased the Texas Instruments BA II Plus Financial Calculator. This is a great product. It works great and so far I have not had any problems.
2,Died after a month,"I purchased this calculator for a managerial finance class and it died a month into the semester. I tried resetting it to no avail. I had to purchase another one because I could not go without it for a couple weeks while it was being replaced under warranty. Overall, I was very disappointed and I would not recommend purchasing this calculator unless it is specifically required for a class."
5,So good seller,"I got this caculator before the predicted day, it really likes a new one even though it is an used one. I have the cover, the handbook. Wonderful quality for a second hand appliance."
5,TI BA II Plus,This is a good calculator that I need for an insurance accounting course. It is nice and light and intuitive.
5,Still have it.,This item works. I recomment buying it. If you don't buy it you suck because it's a calculator and it's totally useful.
3,Was required,"I am a student and this specific calculator was required for a business class. The calculator does what it needs to do, but compared to my TI 83 I hate it. Because this calculator should only one line at a time it is not as user friendly, and it is harder to find any mistake you might make."
4,quite good but concerned,good&#12290;but I don't know the battery can last for how long.Cause it's a secondhand calculator.I hope i can use it for at least 2years
3,"Not too user friendly, but does the job","First off, let me say that as far as doing what it is supposed to do (calculating financial problems), this works like a charm.That said, I would like to point out its shortcomings. I've owned a Casio and HP, and both had excellent menu-driven functionality. Even those that dont have menu systems were were user-friendly and anyone could pick one up and start using using without the need for a manual. The TI, unfortunately, is very bad in this. The placement of keys further adds to this problem - I would have expected data-entry (for stats) to be easy, but the enter key is so small and placed at a very counter-intuitive location that it is still hard for me to enter data as fast as I could with my Casio.The buttons are not the best. I always have to look at the screen after every press to make sure it got entered. My Casio's buttons were the best, you could be sure that if you pressed it, it would be there.But again, if you're used to a TI, this should be fine."
1,Very bad experience to buy this old products,"This is not good product over all , Time value of money functions are not working properly and It is too old financial calculator"
2,too complicated,"too complicated is not equivalent to ""sophisticated"".if this item is not required for AIMR and not recommended by Schweser, I would definitely go with HB 10B II, which is the best, I think.When I use HB, it only took me a brief review of the instruction menu to get used to its functions, but this TI menu is not clear, and the calculation is complicated. I don't think it."
4,Works as promised,I purchased this calculator for a finance class and it does the job. Includes some very helpful functions. Our professor cautioned us to make sure we clear data from the calculator and this one has a tendency to store data and inadvertently use it for another calculation.
2,too big and clunky and awkwardly designed,"I already have a Texas Instruments BA-35 Financial calculator that I purchased back in 1993. It has served me well. A few weeks ago I misplaced it. After two days of searching, I gave up, and purchased this BAIIplus to replace it. Luckily, I found the BA-35 a day later. When this new calculator arrived, I was really disappointed in it. First, it FEELS CHEAP...second, it is HUGE and CLUNKY and has a very awkward hard shell that you must REMOVE then snap onto the BACK. It took several tries to get the calculations sequence figured out...there are some minor changes from the previous calculator. I will use this as a backup, but it is too large and I hate that pop-off cover.(the old one is slim, and came with a nice flip-open vinyl case, with an interior pocket where I keep the instructions, should I need them.)"
2,Only so-so,"This calculator functions fine. What I don't like about it is that you have to very (very) deliberately punch the keys in order to type the number in. If you tap the number instead of deliberately press it, it won't enter. This, I find, slows me down significantly. The keys also feel cheap--like a kid's calculator."
4,BA II Plus Fin'l Calculator,"Great product and very useful!Great service ordering it through Amazon, not to mention lower price."
4,Good but...,"The design is a bit old for this times (from the 90,s) - a 3-4 rows screen would make the difference. The buttons needs some work on the ergonomy...By comparison with the HP thing is much easier to use."
2,Simply bad.,"First of all it's not worth the $33. The buttons are slow and does not respond. This calculator is for people with slow fingers and thinking. If you press too quick this thing will not follow you. You need to slow down and take a cup of tea. When i first open this thing, the calculator feels like it is one of those 99 cent calculator."
5,would recommend this seller,the item was shipped out fast in the stated condition. Also contacted the seller with inquires and questions were answered within 24hrs.
2,Good buut,The calculator is good but the buttons aren't that good and the battery is almost irreplacable and there are no instructions or catalogue that shows u how to do it so use it once and throw it away...
5,Excellent Financial Calculator,This financial calculator offers the full range of functionality for any user just entering the world of financial planning or for the more seasoned professional!
2,The keyboard sucks,"Having used for a month. Have to push a key very hard in order to enter something. Otherwise, it will just skip. This becomes really annoying when you need to type in something fast, for example, in an exam!"
5,shipping is so fast!!!,"Shipping by prime is so fast, but the package is a litte difficult for me to open it. I haven't used it too much, but right now, it seems very good, so hope in the future it can keeps going on."
3,Good calculator,"I bought this calculator for the CFI tests and I still have some difficulties handling it, it's not as simple as it should be."
5,Business Calculator,I bought it for a college finance class and it was required to have a financial calculator. It gets the job done and the manual is plenty helpful when there is any need for assistance.
5,Verrt easy to use.,It has a lot of features and verry easy to use.The user manual is verry well put together and offers alot of solutions and examples.
4,Not too bad,"First things first, I never knew what the difference between a normal scientific calculator and a financial calculator was until I was required to purchase one for an introductory business class. I asked for some suggestions from my company's finance department and they recommended either this calculator or the HP 12c I think is the number. I went with this model as it is the one used by my book for the class.I immediately fell in love with it and have only begun to scrape the surface of all it's wonderful abilities. This calculator would have made my life a lot easier in earlier classes I took where I did all the calculations by hand that this calculator does with a press of a button.It is easy to use, easy to understand, the manual is written in a manner that is step by step, and I really love this calculator."
3,same calc diff results,because 2 plus 2 should be 4 but sometimes comes out 3 or 5 when the calc is complex i find myself consulting an assoc rather than trusting the product
5,Perfect,"I neded this calculator for my accounting class, and this came promptly with no delays. The calculator worked well, and to this day I haven't had a problem with the device yet. I would definitely recommend buying from this seller."
1,Issues with buttons,"I had to buy this calculator, because it was one of allowed calculators I could use for the FRM exam. Otherwise, I would not recommend anyone to buy this product. The biggest problem I had with this calculator was that buttons were not very responsive. For instance, many times a decimal point key button did not registered even after a firm press. So I was forced to re-enter again, which caused me to waste a precious time during the exam. Also the built quality is very bad too."
2,BE CAREFUL,"Be careful when buying this calculator.You have to open the whole casing to change the battery.I personally do not understand why this calculator is chosen for the CFA exam. Unscrewing and prying open the calculator can be challenging.As my CFA exam is coming, I practiced changing my battery when two weeks ago the calculator when short circuit and was no longer able to calculate I/Y for NPV calculations.Can you imagine what happened if this is already in CFA test situation?!? BummerI may have to bring two TI BA II for the test just in case.If you aren't planning to take the CFA test, I'd strongly recommend getting another Financial calculator."
1,Attractively Priced For a Reason...,"Realistically, the BA II Plus can do everything you need from a financial calculator - any of the more advanced function that are lacking are better suited for Excel anyway.My problem is that for the simple, everyday uses, the BA II Plus requires more keystrokes and is more 'complex' than its counterparts. For people who value time and efficiency, stay away.I believe this is a classic example of 'you get what you pay for.' Spring for the more expensive HP unless you absolutely cannot afford it."
3,not as good as its predecessor,"No need to repeat the comprehensive reviews already posted. Two comments I wish to add:1) more buttons, more functions = simple calculations more complicated2) confusing display. e.g., when you amortize a debt and compute the payment amount, the answer will appear as a NEGATIVE number. (the manual confirms this)"
4,Texas calculator,Works well however having trouble figuring out certain functions. Could be more user friendly.
4,not bad financial calculator,It is a good calculator. Sometimes hard to figure out. It rounds the numbers. Serves my purpose however.
4,The Best Finance Calc for the Money,"The BA II plus has all of the necessary features that a finance student might need. It also includes a small quick-reference sheet in the cover, which is helpful. It can be a bit tricky to properly set up compound interest rates, and it tends to round off decimals too much, but its nothing compared to the hassle of trying to do financial math on the TI-83 finance program."
5,Everything I expected!,The product was brand new like the seller said. It's great--- just as if I'd gone out and bought it at the store! :) Very pleased. Thanks!
4,Just what i expected,"This calculator was required for a class, and was just what I expected to receive"
5,great item,It is a necessary item in our Investment class. The caculator is shipped fast and good in shape and function. Its design is easy for using and is highly recommended by our professor. I think it will be my companion from my academic years to career life.
4,Financial Calculator,"I love the Texas Instruments financial calculator. I have been using them for many years. However, the one I recently bought from Amazon the interest rate was factory set to 1 and was giving me the wrong calculations. I called Texas Instruments and was told how to re-set it and was told that earlier versions of the calculator the interest was not set at 1. Their customer service was very friendly and helpful."
2,Functional,"No multi-view, difficult to make multiple chain calculations. Does the basic functions for financial calculations, but for the price, would not recommend."
4,Functions well,"Bought this calculator for a finance class and it functions just as I need it to. Bought it refurbished and it works very well. Only problem is that the display is faded, like it is illuminated at half brightness. Other than that it is a good purchase."
4,Good.,"Easy to use. But if you press button too quickly, the calculating may not reflect to it. Careful and good lucky!"
2,Format Key doesn't work,"I liked the value of the calculator, but for class I am required to use all functions possible. I needed 9 decimals to show up for most of my calculations but the factory settings on financial calculators are usually 2 decimals. So when I needed to use the Format key it brings me IRR which is another function on the calculator. Since only two decimals show up, I rarely got to use the calculators full functions. A big disappointment, but I do think I have a defective calculator, and hopefully I get a new one or a refund. Never done this action before, but I hope I didn't waste money. Otherwise, it would be a great calculator."
4,"Nice size, works well, but a little complicated to use","There is definitely a learning curve for this item. I found myself pouring over the intruction manual way too many times, spending more time on figuring out how to use the calculator than actually using it to calculate! It is a nice size and has a ton of functions-way more than I will ever need."
5,Business student,"Very handy to have this product, though complicated at times it is a fantastic calculator.Another great TI invention."
4,What is Armstong talking about...?,"If you've read the previous review(s) by Mike Armstong, please disregard his comments. This is a great calculator for the CFA exam (from someone that has passed all 3 levels on the first try...with ease!). If you are getting different answers with the same input please see inclosed manual entitled ""USER ERROR."" This is NOT possible (if you understand how calculators are made and work) unless that particular calculator is broken OR you have yet to master the 'BGN' and 'END' functions of the calculator (for example). The previous reviewer should learn to read the manual, otherwise the CFA is the least of your problems...."
3,Decent.,"It's okay. Good for the cost. I will warn you, the screen is small and it is vital to have instructions on how to use. It is not very straightforward."
1,Very poor quality,"The hard cover is easily damaged from daily use. Dust get into the screen only after one month's use. Need to look at the screen all the time to make sure if key strokes are entered correctly. Buttons are very hard to press, always gives me a awful feeling when I press them. I bought this calculator only because it is required for my finance class"
2,"Slow, slow, and slow.","This calculator came days past its already distantly-predicted delivery date. I needed it for class and ordered it in plenty of time and didn't receive it until I had already gone without it in multiple class times. When I finally received it, the screen had black digital marks on it that have faded some now but still reappear at the slightest touch. Overall I am not happy."
3,better if it can be more swift..,"This product is a ""must"" for some courses. But I found it's not swift enough when typing. hope TI can modify it..."
3,fincalc,if u don't do a complete memory erase you never get the same calculations. It gets the job done just make sure to erase
5,Came brand new,Thank you so much for this calculator. Finance was a success and I was also able to use it for accounting. I recommended you to a fellow classmate!! Keep up the great work!!
1,Absolutely the pits,"This calculator is necessary for my finance class, especially the time value money mode, and yet when I follow the instructions in the manual, keying in the number to match the key, it never seems to hold the value. I cannot get this thing to work for me at all. Even some of the basic functions described in the manual do not work, and I know I am following their directions!"
3,Don't be cheap....,"I bought the Texes BA II Plus and found the buttons incredibly frustrating to work with. I borrowed a friends BA II Plus Professional and it is a much finer product. The kind of calculator you can grow old with and one day share stories with over a glass of French brandy (I mean it's a calculator for life). the functionality of the two calculators was the same for my purpose, CFA Lvl 1,2,3. Just $10 more for the professional is totally worth it, I subsequently bought my own BA II Plus Professional and my original plastic BA II Plus is in the bottom of a draw somewhere...I couldn't sell the thing..."
2,Thanks man,I was annoyed that the calculator didn't come with it's cover. The sender should have made this clear before I received it.
4,Good calculator,Its a good calculator. Really easy to use and no flaws. I suggest everyone should get one and use it in class.
3,A social analyze of Paris in the XIXth century,"A definitive contrast between the men called the Thirteen and social life in Paris at the beginning of past century. On one hand, we have men dedicated to their principles and goals, and on the other hand, a declining noble society only busy with itself and its past glory. In the meantime one can feel how the less glamorous society is evolving and maturing."
4,reviewing the Greek Ideal of Diana Watts,"Diana Watts was a remarkable character who at the age of 47 and in the year 1917 wrote an amazing book on The Renaissance of the Greek Ideal. In it she explains her train of thought as she dug into Greek sculpture to understand the laws and asthetics of Ancient Greek Body Movement. She also cross referenced her impressions with Judo. She was one of the first non Japanese women to study Judo.What she came up with is very intriguing and useful. A series of exercises to discover the Greek Body of the Ancients. The book is well worth reading by physical culture enthusiasts, martial arts people, yoga people and students of Ancient Greek Culture. Unfortunately for some technical reason you have to get on line and buy the pictures separately for another ten dollars or so. But it is worth it if you are into this kind of thing. Prayers and thanks to Diana - hope I meet her in the next life!Allen Pittman"
1,La présentation est ratisanale et ne corresond pas la la photo ci-contre. Uen grosse déception.,"En commandant ce CD, je pensais recevoir celui dont la photo ce trouve sur cette passe. Ce que j'ai reu respecte le programme, mais seemble tre une contrefaon (tout en noir et blanc, pas d'indication ""L'Oiseau Lyre), pas de texte franais. Un CD pirate? UNe graosse déception pour moi; j'ai trouvé ailleurs ce CD, mais nepourra pas revendre un objet frelaté.Le vendeur n'a pas le droit delivrer un article qui ne correspond pas à ce qui est décrit (avvec photos!). 0/5"
2,Wasn't the orininal song,"Sorry, The song I was looking for on this CD wasn't the oringinal song I requested. In turns, I had to purchase another CD from another seller who had the oringinal song I was requesting. cheree"
5,Wonderful!,"Moya was a new artist to me and I approached this album with a bit of trepidation. Once I heard it, however, it rose to the top of the ""to be played today"" list. Despite playing it over and over, I have yet to tire of it.If you like Celtic music, this is a ""must have."""
3,So-so,"I'm normally a fan of this genre of music, but Moya's (Maire in Gaelic) music is only so-so. After listening a couple of times, I never listen anymore."
5,Awesome CD,"An artfully crafted blend of traditional celtic/folk sound and contemprary songs. Not quite what you'd hear at a folk club, to be sure, but you can definately hear the traditional celtic influences. Several of the songs have a bit of Gaelic woven into them somewhere, one even has some chorus & background sung in Native American tongues. Beautiful vocals too. I absolutely love it :)"
1,Only trading in one problem for another with this cable...,"I bought the Dynex 10 ft. extension cable to give me a bit more room under my desk allowing me to move my desktop out of the way. The result is plenty of room under the desk, but a horrible image on screen...The Dynex cable felt thin between my fingers compared to the monitor cables I've become used to working with over the past 15 years. Once I turned on the monitor, I immediately noticed that the screen looked yellowish green and there was a shadow effect that really became bothersome. I tried to ""auto calibrate"" my 15"" Dell flatpanel to no avail.. Dont waste your time with this cable. I'm going to look for a higher quality one to replace it."
1,Complete Junk,"I wanted to replace some KVM cables with simple VGA extension cables and bought two os this product. They are complete junk, images on screen all had shadows and looked terrible. I went back to the bulky KVM cables,"
4,Best toilet brush I've had,"I disagree with the first reviewer of this product. If you wish to remove the brush from its clamshell, simply grab the handle and push it to one side. The clamshell opens up automatically. I like this brush because the brush head is well made and durable, the clamshell keeps the brush covered (from kids and animals) and the drain feature in the bottom helps the brush to dry and thus prevents molding or rusting. I'm buying a second to keep in the upstairs bathrooms as well as my downstairs bathroom. A little pricey, but I doubt if I'll have to replace it anytime soon."
2,"poorly designed for use, but looks stylish","Ok, this thing ""looks"" cool with its sleek design and clam shell container but it not very practical.The handle is made of heavy plastic and the brush is well made too. The problem is that after you use the brush the clam shell container keeps itself closed, so you have to bend down and use your hand to hold the container open (both sides since its a clam shell) and put the brush back in. I don't know about you, but I was looking for a brush that didn't require me to be in contact with the poop I had to clean."
2,The turn signals are garbage,"The metal work is excellent but the turn signals are garbage.1. the leads are too short. Has this kit been installed on a CBR??2. the turn signals are not weatherproof. One rainy day in Seattle and they were shot, both bulbs exploded."
3,buy this if you want aids,kdding ... it killed a couple fleas last year.. but the most important thing to do is always treat your pet first.. everymonth.. and keeep your carpets cleaner than virgans pooper..
1,"Crap, don't waste you money.","My boyfriend and I purchased this product to bomb our house this past weekend. We followed the direction step by step and even used two bombs just to be on the safe side. It had little to no effect on our flea situation. I personally would suggest anyone who is interested in purchasing this product to save there money and hire a professional. It'll save you lots of money, frustration and aggravation."
1,Worthless,"I bought this stuff because it has an IGR in it, supposedly, along with some kind of flea poison. It is supposed to protect against adult and pre-adult fleas. Either it is so lightweight as to be worthless or they are lying about what is in it. If you buy this junk, double the amount of canisters because what they say does not get the job done. Typical Zodiac product. I decided to give them one more try and their stuff does not work."
3,"Killed some fleas, going to try another to finish the job","I was perhaps a bit rush/unprepared completing the fogging, and didn't have time to vacuum and used blankets instead of newspaper around the foggers (why do they want newspaper?). I treated my cat at the same time with medicine that should have killed all fleas on him within 12 hours and let him back in after maybe 4. But the flea population seemed to be down about 50% for a bit before returning to full strength a few days later. I was going to tear my old crappy carpets out anyways and this is as good of a time as any. Also going to toss my flea nasty infested sofa and try fogging the house again with a different brand.Summary: didn't work, but I could have better prepared."
1,fleabitten,"This product does not work. I've repeated the use twice over a 14 day period. I just treated on Friday and have been out of town for the weekend. I just got back (3 days later) sat on the couch and had 3 fleas jump on me in a few minutes. I was shocked to look down and see them! I even have hard wood floors and a leather couch, so less area for them to procreate! I even did the carpet treatment and treated furniture separately as advised. Do not waste your money."
2,not effective,Either my fleas were mutant radioactive superfleas or this product's kung-fu is weak. What /did/ work was spreading orthoboric acid powder everywhere and waiting patiently for a weak for all the fleas to die off. Look that one up: orthoboric acid; it kills all stages of fleas from eggs to adults and the only drawback is having white powder spread everywhere in your house... but it worked.
2,Not the Best Design!,"KP Industries used to make Great Knee Pro Ultra Flex II Knee Pads which picture you can see above and is not a picture of real Ultra Flex III Knee Pads. Ultra Flex III Knee Pads look different and have a different Straps and Buckles design. I posted a picture of real Ultra Flex III Knee Pads too. The Straps slip very easy and the Buckles are much harder to clip to the Pads ears in comparison with Ultra Flex II Pads. As the Contractor, I own and use them both and can tell the difference. Bad design + made in China!!!"
5,best knee pads ever,"Best knee pad ever. I have used numerous knee pads and all were basically worn the same way and all usually slid down, bound and hurt behind the knee [popliteal area]. This has a two piece construction that stays put, has a rubber/soft plastic non scuff and non slip pad in the front and is head and shoulders above any kneepad I have worn or seen. It is in a class all its own. Highly recommended."
4,Not bad,These knee pads are light and easy to work in. Defiantly worth the investment if you are looking for comfort while needing to kneel a lot.
2,Too bulky.,I bought this because of the high ratings but these knee pads are too bulky and tend to pinch your skin when you are wearing shorts. I wish I bought those gel knee pads from Home Depot or Lowes.
4,Works GREAT!,"I began a new career in resilient floors and these knee pads are fantastic! They are not as good as Knee Pro's $240 knee pads, but for the price, you can't go wrong! My kness feel great after 8 hours! My only issue is the sweat that builds up when you use them for long periods of time, but I'd prefer sweat to painful knees. If you just can't spend the big bux on the high end pads, get these!"
1,Save your money,I was hoping this would be a collection of dramatized ghost stories along the lines of some old radio program like The Shadow Knows. I wanted to set it up on my front porch to add intrigue as T-or-T'ers were wandering by. It's not at all what I was looking for. I'm glad I didn't spend much. Think I'll donate it to the neighborhood elementary school library. Maybe someone can get some use out of it there. Just not what I was looking for.
3,Very amuzing,"Fly With Me by Tera Leilani Walker (note: there are other books with similar title), published by Dorrance Publishing Co., is a light reading. I was amused by the stories the author narrated to make her point across and she was very effective in doing so. Although I am not a big fan of poetry, the author's poems were very clear and entertaining. I wish she had more stories to tell in her book."
3,Good but aimed at the wrong age group,"Younger children will enjoy this book but its mazes have the same look as many free mazes on the web. Do your homework on this book before you want to shell out the money. In my opinion, this book is for children aged 3-7.SC-RG"
3,Mazes??,My daughter is 5 and she is a maze freak... this book however proved a little difficult for her. She likes the mazes but some of them are hard to tell where the lines are at..Also some need more specific instructions such as dont go under or over the lines that cross (Rocking Rollers Maze) Surfs Up and Raining Cats and Dogs were also mazes my daughter had difficulty with because of the less defined boarders of the maze. However i am reviewing the book in the eyes of a 5 year old little girl so take that in mind...
4,NEVER LEAVE THIS COUNTRY WITHOUT RICK IN YOUR BACK POCKET!!!,"I recently travelled to France using Rick Steves' reference guide to this area. He had an unsually amount of useful and accurate information that placed you right in the middle of the action. We found ourselves frequently referring to this guide when we entered a city, in order to plan our days and nights adventure. Rick, we are stuck on your down to earth commentary that keeps us laughing in the worst of situations. No one will feel intimidated or unsure after reading this selection. Good luck in your travels and may peace follow you."
4,"Rick Steves' France, Belgium, and the Netherlands","Rick Steves' did it again. This book is a great guide for seeing the main areas of France, Belgium and the Netherlands. I stayed in one of the B&B's and a hotel he recommended for Brugge, and they both were everything he said. The information on Paris is exact and helpful, especially the way he separates Paris into three maps. The hotel prices for all countries are right on the money, even in the busy season. One of the best things about this book, is that he always includes helpful information; i.e. how to use the phones; where the tourist info. is; the approximate exchange rates, etc. I love his books and never go traveling without them."
5,The ending totally shocked me,"I love it when a movie can surprise me since it's rare that ever happens. So when I come across a movie like ""The Others"" that I thought I had all figured out, only to be delightfully proved wrong, I get very excited. There's a plot twist involving the elderly couple that I guessed early on, and I suspect most audiences will suspect early on. However, the final ending was something I had NO idea was going to happen.This movie moves slowly in some parts, however, Nicole Kidman's character is so bizarre that I was able to keep interested in this movie even during the slow parts. I kept trying to figure her out.An example of her bizarre behavior is in the beginning when she takes all these special precautions and administers warnings before anyone can even see her kids. I kept wondering if her kids had rabies or something.Overall, I'm very pleased that there's still master filmmakers out there who can delight audiences with great plot twists."
5,A modern-day calssic,"This is one of the best ghost stories ever written, it's up there with classics like the 1963 version of ""The Haunting"". Very few ghost stories have ever been able to obtain such an amazing level of horror and at the same time maintain its dignity.It's very refreshing to see a ghost movie that does not rely on computer effects and cheap, make-you-jump-out-of-your-seat moments of shock (but don't fret, you WILL jump out of your seat more than once). It achieves its horror through subtle lighting and sound effects, something that's virtually impossible to find in most modern-day horror movies.It starts off a little slow, but quickly grabs your attention and doesn't let go until the end. Speaking of the end, it has a surprise ending that will blow you away and leave you talking about it for days.Don't miss ""The Others""."
5,WOW!!!,"What else can I say?? The Others is certainly one of the best suspense films I've seen in a long time. Nicole Kidman is fantastic. A trio of servants come to help a young woman and her two kids. The children have a strange condition in which they will break out into blisters and die if their eyes are exposted to light. Mysterious, eerie, spine-chilling, and spooky---an all around great film. The Others is a ""true"" scary movie, unlike those gory, bloodbath, ax chopping films (i.e. Friday the Thirteenth). The Others is the third film from the talented director Alejandro Amenabar. I can't wait for his next movie. If you are someone who enjoys suspenseful films that will keep you guessing until the very last scene, then watch The Others. You're in for a wicked ride!!"
3,Decent but contrived.,"I really tried to like this movie a lot but, in the end, found it to be just OK. Luckily I rented it as I'll probably never watch it again. If you really like haunted house stories you might buy this film, otherwise save your money and just rent it. The ending was too neatly wrapped up and extremely un-original, I wish Hollywood could come up with something new every once in awhile.If you are a big Nicole Kidman fan do yourself a favor and skip this movie and buy Moulin Rouge. Now that is a movie!"
5,Flawless,"This is a great film for many reasons, and most of all for the trio of mother and children. Nicole Kidman and the two child actors are perfect and totally believable in their period roles. This has to be Nicole Kidman's best performance ever. The actors playing the servants were excellent too.The writing of the relationship between the three is brilliant too, I havent seen a better potrayal of mother and children in any film.Normally I'm irritated by dark and gloomy interiors in films, but here the atmosphere was just right. The film reminds me of old ghost-story books I read in school (long ago), and also of The Turn of The Screw. The mood is so different from The Sixth Sense that I did not notice any similarity while watching."
4,Not Alejandro's best - but still a classic ghost story,"Yes, it won't keep you thinking for days like Open your Eyes did, but it will still make your Sunday afternoon be a fun one. I was happy to spend my seven dollars (including of course my old, old student ID) on this movie. It made me wonder, it frightened me, it kept me going until a very suprising and unexpected ending. Yes: I won't lie to you like many others who always pretend they weren't surprised by the twist of this or that movie. If we were to pause the movie and ask them what is going on, those pretentious little minds would barely ever get it right."
5,Back to good scary movies,"Looks like there is move to good scary movies again. With sixth sense and the others maybe there will be more to follow. The reviewer quoited was much too harsh. This was a movie that makes one think even after seeing the movie. I always liked watching the twilight zone and alfred hitchkock movies. It didn't have any of that blood and gore that dominated the horror flicks for the last 3 or 4 decades. Hopefully this is a sign that we will have the choice of seeing more thought provoking, sophisticated scary movies."
4,Surprisingly Original Storyline!,"Without giving too much of the movie away, this movie was surprisingly original in it's storyline. It took us almost the whole movie to figure out what was really going on. The overall film setting is a little dark, but the acting is very good. I would recommend this film to those who like the supernatural with a lot of suspense thrown in!"
2,"Can I have my money back, please?","The movie opens with Kidman screaming, and screaming, and screaming. She clutches her heart, woodenly attempts to look terrified (perhaps someone should have handed her a terminatoin notice for some real affect), and off we go watching her chewing the scenery pretending to act. My God, who told this chick she's an actor? That's the first problem. The star of this flick can't act and it only becomes more painful to watch because her costars do quite well. The second problem? Isn't a script suppose to have a plot? (Not as a plot in the ground, as in a story that is developed.)This ditty rambles on in apredictable manner and meanwhile Kidman just gets more shrill. Oh please. Enough. Thank goodness even money couldn't buy her a best actress award. The lighting and photography are nicely done so it has some visual appeal. If you are really in the mood for a badly done movie stick to Ed Wood and leave the acting awards for Inspector Clay."
2,"Gobble, gobble....","This little yawner proves what hype can do for a movie. I could hardly stay awake but managed to for the ending...which was apparent half way through and was almost worth the wait. I think Nicole Kidman actually DID phone this one in. If you like watching her stomping around, opening and closing doors, and yelling at servants and children, rent this bomb. You won't be disappointed. Two discs? Hilarious. The second went back to the vid store a virgin."
2,A horrible movie.,"The Others isn't very good. It is about a family during World War II who moved into a new house. It is basically plotless and the little plot it has is extremely stupid. The kids are allergic to sun... How rediculous. Nicole Kidman was okay in this movie but come on... Alergic to sun? Once you finish watching this movie you'll star to notice untied noghts such as why was that father there. That scene with the father did not add to the plot at all. The ending is extremely stupid, and the annoying fake accents of those kids will annoy the heck out of you. It isn't as good as he sixth sense I'll tell you that..."
2,Scary ... how many people rate this film,"I suffered through this dull and predictable film last night, and I am amazed at the overwhelming number of positive reviews. So many people seem to have confused a lack of pace and creakingly slow storytelling with ""atmosphere"". Pivotal plot points are delivered with granite-slab subtlety, removing any real sense of mystery. Other events like the heroine's husband's brief appearance are nonsense, even within the film's own odd reality, or pure McGuffin like the ""things buried under the leaves"". The plot is slight to the point of non-existence and anyone who has read any review that mentions ""the twist"" will spend half the time trying to predict it. Admittedly one late scene actually made me jump, but lock me in a dark room in front of anything this dull for long enough and almost any loud noise will shock me awake. Not helped at all by Nicole Kidman who is a very weak lead."
2,Bruce Willis was dead the whole time?,"The plot of this movie was very interesting (although it seemed I was watching The Sixth Sense again). I was not impressed by Nicole Kidman's acting, although the other actors were convincing.But, the thing that ruined my whole movie experience was a scene in which Nicole Kidman is talking to the new servants (towards the beginning). As she is explaining about the house, the appearance of a microphone can be seen peeking from above. I saw that (according to the audiences' snickerings, it was appearant that they did too), and I thought that maybe it was just one mistake. However, that microphone made a cameo through that whole scene. I hate to sound so critical; however, I feel that this caused me to think poorly upon the movie."
2,BORING!,"Well crafted direction with good performances by the children, this movie is not very scary, and is a trojan horse for themes that attack religion and pro-war politics. All fine and well, but the story cannot support such large themes since it is trite, manipulative, and is so concerned with setting us up with its trick ending. Children may be frightened at some of the faux horror, but if you let them watch it till the end, they'll fall asleep and wake up as liberals. You been warned!Want to save money and find out the ending? Here it is: everybody is dead, including the screenwriter!"
2,slow slow slow,"The reviews for this movie were rather favorable, so I was looking forward to a good scary movie. What I got was a slow, boring movie with no payoff at the end. The movie felt like ... ""The Sixth Sense"". Nicole Kidman plays an unpleasant, unlikeable mother, and her performance can best be described as ""adequate"". Lots of unresolved details that fool you into thinking there is more to the story than meets the eye (why were the children photosensitive? Why did the father show up? Why was he sick for two days? Don't bother to guess--you will never find out by the end of the moive. I can appreciate the attempt to make an old-fashioned ghost story (no gore, etc.), however this was just too boring to pull it off. You may jump a few times, but only because you'll be half-asleep!"
1,how obvious is this one?,"Basically ""The Others"" is a big budget, polished ""Twilight Zone"" episode without any of the warmth or charm. It's big surprise twist is so transparent that if you haven't got it in the first 15 minutes you will enjoy it, but you obviously don't think while you watch films.Why is the film set in the 40's? Just what is it that happened when Nicole had her previous turn that everyone's whispering about? - Answer these questions and the rest of the film is a boring period piece.Yes it is well made, but that Bruce Willis film used the idea (and disguised it) so much better."
1,Beware of Boredom,"Do not be fooled by people who are comparing this movie to the Sixth Sense. While the Sixth Sense kept you interested throughout the movie with Bruce Willis' struggle to reach the boy, The Others was filled with a very boring and ordinary story line until the end. Unfortunately, I have to admit that I actually sat through the entire movie, but only to see how they could possibly end a movie that never seemed to really start. In short, it was easily the worst movie I've seen this year."
1,The Others,This movie was sooooo slow moving that more than half way through I still had no idea what the point was. The last twenty minutes were good and revealing. The acting was professional. The location was interesting. Too much time was spent on the beginning of the film. I would have found the story more interesting if time was taken from the beginning and added to the ending instead. Maybe this was payback from Tom Cruise to Nicole Kidman. I would deffinitely not recomend this film.
1,"slow, boring,big let down!","After seeing the television ads for this movie, I wasnt very interested in seeing it, but after reading reviews on Amazon thought I would give it a chance......I should have gone with my first instinct, this is very slow , boring and for me at least, quite predictable. The climax of the film is just not worth waiting for,I have seen way better made for TV movies than this, I really felt I wasted my money on this one. I think one of the reviews I read compared it to ""The Sixth Sense"" and if you beleive this your in for a big let down."
1,Another disappointment,"I can only say, after watching this movie on tape, DON'T BOTHER! Save your money for something better."
4,Good new ghost movie,"The Others stars an Australian, one of my faves to be true, NIcole Kidman, Academy Award Winner Nicole Kidman.It's about a woman who has two children, who are both super-sensitive to the sun and bright lights. The servants have all vanished, and three new ones appear on the door-step, but Kidman hadn't posted the add yet.She hires them, but soon, locked doors open, and invisible people can be heard walking and laughing through the house.Kidman becomes scared, as drawn curtains open and endangers her children.BUt the children make a horrific discovery, and a terrifying secret is revealed.Good, but Kidman says she hated herself in it."
5,Spooky classic,"This type of ghost story follows the spooky classics made in the 1950's and stands as an excellent ghost story. Constantly increasing tension and verbal clues lead the viewer down many paths with a lovely surprise ending.Volume level is variable, so much so that the movie really needs constant adjustment, so keep the remote handy."
4,The Others,"The compelling supernatural thriller THE OTHERS, starring Nicole Kidman is one of the most effectively-shocking films since THE SIXTH SENSE. The hook of the film is to not so much visual exposition, but cleverly implied with Kidman's brilliant performance and incredible tension-building suspense. Sharp editing a brooding score add to the film's visual panache, and with so much talent behind the project, it certinally delivers. The director, Alejandro Amenabar, assembles the film like a jigsaw puzzle by not giving too much away until the gripping climax, including several moments which made me jump in the cinema! Great stuff.The DVD extras are impressive with this ""Special Edition"" 2 disc set including ""A Look Inside The Others"" - 30 minute documentary, a visual effects featurette, a doco about director Alejandro Amenabar, The Others photo album and theatrical trailers."
4,The Real Haunting,"The Others is no doubt better than all of those other recent haunted house movies such as ""The Haunting, 13 Ghosts and House on Haunted Hill"". It's only flaws are that it's really slow and that the end doesn't make complete sense although it is shocking. Nicole Kidman is fantastic as a mother who's raising her 2 children by herself when her husband went off to war. She's stuck living in a huge mansion where her children start seeing and hearing other people. She refuses to believe it herself until she starts experienceing it herself. What makes The Others better than those other movise I mentioned is that it plays with your head and makes you think about who's really the ghosts and who's actually the ones being haunted."
5,Perfect Ghost Story,"Rarely does one find a horror movie that merits five stars but this movie certainly was entertaining throughout. From Nicole Kidman's overly doting motherly character to the fearful, pallid children, and eerie house staff contributed to the perfect ghostly aura of the movie.The setting in the dark, dank castle with thick fog surrounding all day and night provided an appropriate backdrop to the ensuing horror thoughout. The story itself was extremely creative and the fear that it instills in its viewers is done through tasteful ghostly theatrics, rather than blood, guts, and gore, which in my opinion is more realistic and evokes a real chill in one's bones.A highly recommended movie to all those that love a little fright at night!"
4,"Wait, which movie was I watching?","Although this was an excelent movie, I have to wonder if the writer(s) had just finished watching ""Sixth Sense"" before sitting down to write this movie. The similarities between the two films made me ask, ""wait, what movie am I watching?""It was nice to see Nicole Kidman to play a different type of character for once and she was exceptional in her part. The children were amazing and the servents were just creepy. The set was interesting and made the viewer wonder why anyone would choose to live there. But, it added to the surrel feel of the film.This movie had several twists and turns and an ending I never guessed.I would strongly recomend this film for viewers who like scary movies, but don't wish to be scared to death."
3,slow but catches your attention,"this is a kind of movie that you have to actually pay attention and catch every detail becuase if not you will miss something important. but i reccomend this, but its not all that to catch at the theatre. wait until it comes out on dvd or video"
3,"Interesting, but nothing really happens...","This movie is okay to watch, but nothing really ever happens. There's suspense, but you don't leave terrified because there's not frightening images or scenes to stick out in your mind. Even the overly advertised ""I am your daughter"" scene isn't really that frightening. It's just that the girl looks old and is blind w/ milky eyes. Nothing else. Still, it's interesting and the end will throw you for a loop. Also, Nicole Kidman has a 5 star performance. She is such a great actress in this movie. She's totally believable that you forget it's just a movie. The kids are cute, too, but aren't very convincing. The servants are okay, but don't have the quality of performance that Kidman does. Without her amazing performance, this movie would not be worth watching."
2,Not bad but not good either,"I went to watch The Others even though most of the people who watched it warned me not to. The movie wasn't horribly bad but there was nothing there to make it good either. The setup and the background of this movie was so awfully forced and contrived and even the actors' (including Kidman) reactions were unconvincing. I felt like I was watching a cheesy horror flick (like Scream). The movie had a very bad turn when the husband arrived. His arrival was utterly pointless and went on for a boring 30 mins. Finally the movie got back on track. The ending was not a big enough payoff for the hour and half of creaking floors, slamming doors and horrified gasps. To place ""Sixth Sense"" in the same category as ""The Others"" is an insult to SS. For better thrillers check out the ""The Shining"" and ""Carrie"" in which horror and terror lies within everyday life."
2,a Poor Man's 6th Sense,this film was fairly easy to predict how things would go after the first half hour.it wasn't long before I felt this film was a 6th sense clone.Nicole Kidman is easily one of the Most-Overrated folks in the Acting Business Ever.She brings no Emotion to me in Her Work.She is a ALright Actress but not worth all the Hype She gets.
4,"Excellent, with a great twist","The Others is a good old, traditional, stripped-bare, horror film. It works with a simple storyline, adds a fantastic score, great cutting and filming and a fine actress, ignores the perils of big, complicatd special effects, and shocks, and scares.Kidman is superb in her role as a war housewife who's husband has gone to war, leaving his two children (both allergic to light) behind. After suddenly their servants leave mysteriously, a new set of servants turn up, wanting to work there.Strange things start to happen, and they are associated with the servants. You can see a twist coming, and it does, but there is another twist, an amazing and mindblowing twist which truly explains everything.The film generally is more chilling than outright scary, but some simple but excellent cuts can make the steadiest person jump once or twice. It is genuinely new, and turns the horror film on its head, managing to provoke thought and scare at once."
4,"No gore, just goosebumps","Thank goodness for The Sixth Sense -- they're finally making scary horror movies again WITHOUT bloody knives and ginsu fingernail attachments! It's about time filmmakers remembered how something as simple as a door closing on its own can make you nearly jump out of your seat. This movie brings it all back -- the white knuckles, the goosebumps, the ""YIKES! What was that?!?!?"" - and all at a PG-13 rating. Good job - go see it if you like a good scare!"
4,An intelligent ghost story,"This movie is not one of those blood and gore thrillers. In fact, the most frightening thing is what you don't see or understand. Overall this is a great psycological thriller that keeps you guessing until the surprise ending. So get together with some friends this Halloween and add this one to your ""scary movie"" collection."
4,Good Movie,"Although I fast forwarded through a good part of this movie Nicole Kidman gave her usual fine and totally histrionic performance. Eventually it seems the sky always falls on this ice princess, and now her face almost makes movies by itself. Amazing!You get the feeling that she is a true artist!"
5,The Others is hip and happening,"The Others was a great movie. I can not wait to see it again.This was a rollercoaster ride, actually this was the best rollercoaster ride. These are one of the horror movies you waiting for. I recommend this movie to anyone who is fan of horror or not. Turn off the lights and lock your doors, a witness one the best movies of 2001."
3,So-so,"Yes, Nicole Kidman turns in a nice performance. So do the kid actors. But, no, this is not the greatest movie of all time. Its pacing is agonizingly slow, it's derivative and, ultimately, tedious. Thematically, it's a wannabe ""The Innocents""--the classic Jack Clayton version of The Turn of the Screw, with Deborah Kerr turning in an exquisitely neurasthenic performance. A third of the way into this film, it's fairly obvious what's going on. Yet it's dragged out relentlessly to its foregone conclusion. It's worth seeing as a too-long mood piece, but it's not representative of first-class movie-making."
4,Great Movie,"This was a great movie, it kept me on the edge of my seat. Nicole Kidman's performance was excellent. The information on the second cd was interesting. The only problem was once you've seen it, you know the story. So it is no longer scary."
5,Awesome suspense movie,This is a great suspense movie. Nicole Kidman plays Grace and she is wonderful. She is my favorite actress. It's amazing how she can potray any role someone gives her. I highly recommend this movie and watch carefully and listen or you wont understand!signed a big fan
3,Predictable,"Sorry, I have to disagree with most of the reviews, I thought this movie was boring and predictable. I was very disapointed. The sixth sense is a much better way to spend your time watching a good Flick."
3,A ONE TIME SEE,The others was an excellent movie however its a one time see. The whole plot is a thriller where you are trying to figure out waht is happening. Once you know the ending its not as fun to watch over and over again. I woudl recommend seeing it I thoroughyly enjoyed it the first time i saw it and was shocked by the ending I would compare it to the sixth sence something you never would have guessed happens but after you know i jsut dont think its worth watching over and over.
4,"Nice, Very NIce","While a perfectly good, moody film - I don't think that it has the rewatchability of the film upon which much of it seems based, The Innocents. While I liked the film very much and was gripped by the story and the visual design - I left the theater knowing that it was a one time thing never to be repeated. Rent this film, don't buy - since you most likely won't be watching it again."
4,Well done,"With all the hype surrounding this movie I decided too rent it. I guessed the film's most of the film's mysteries within the first 45 minutes. I didn't think the movie was as scary as people said. It was creepy, not scary. However, this film was a first rate production. The acting, camera work, and lighting are top notch. This film is defintely worth a viewing, and if it isn't your cup of tea, you won't be upset for renting it. I wish more of Hollywood films would attain too the standard of this film. I for one, am sick of those (blah) Halloween sequels and teeny bopper slasher films."
5,Terrifying,"This is a clever, terrifying movie. I hate scary movies but this one is smart. Nicole Kidman and the children (Alakina Mann and James Bentley) are wonderful."
3,Interesting Yet Slow,I thought this movie was interesting and fairly well crafted yet it was just to slow to unfold at times. It reminds me of H.P. Lovecraft a lot. He seemed fond of creepy fogged in and isolated dwellings.Being a fan of modern special effects I surprised myself by enjoying the fact that this was done completely with practical effects. As far as I could tell the only effect was the shaking of a chandelier seen in previews.It's not like What Lies Beneath (or any other Zemeckis film)with all the effects shots that no one even noticed.
2,Quality at it's lowest...!,"The movie itself is my all-time favorite, a piece of cinematic perfection, but this 2 disk DVD set which has the print ""Collector's Series"" is hilarious, while the picture quality and printing on the disks are superb, the packaging is simply junk!! Low quality black plastic case that gives you the impression that it's going to tear along the folding line when you open or close it, the disks release bottons are badly designed and need real FORCE to press them down, the transparent plastic covering the outer poster is foggy, loose!! and full of imperfections and swelled areas (some of them are as big as a drop of dry glue). Not sure what kind of ""collectors"" this edition is targeting??"
4,Chilled to the Spine,"These days, it's not difficult for supernatural thrillers to fill themselves with too much visual effects. Audience would probably agree with me that the new editions of the The Haunted, The House on the Haunted Hill were major disappointments despite that they were star studded with respectable actors & actresses. Then again, there were gems such as The Sixth Sense, The Echo Within. Even though What Lies Beneath was scary at times, the movie was bogged down by its ending. Well, how would I rate the Others? I would have to say that it's on par with the Sixth Sense. The cast was excellent, the setting was sombre, & the development of the story line & the the characters were slow but effective, & it's build up to the twisty ending was first rate. The Others is simply a breath of fresh air, challenging us to see things from other perspectives than how we were accustomed to in the past about the theory of supernatural world. Don't miss it. It's that good."
3,So mediocre it hurts...,"The Others....Look! Its The Sixth Sense... but without Bruce Willis... and not as good... and they didn't have enough money to hire any more actors... or have any additional sets... so its all dark and repetitive...Not really a bad movie at all, but there are just such better ones out there... like... The Sixth Sense.It took too long to get to the nicely done little twist at the end...Worth a rent if you can't find anything else and don't need any action... at all."
3,Good but doesn't live up to the hype,"I feel I need to put in my two cents, despite the fact that this movie has already been reviewed to death.The pros: 1) the film is well made; 2)Kidman and the child actors do a good job; 3) thankfully no full-on murder scenes and stairways coming aliveThe cons: 1) Rather slow; 2)NOT scary. Sorry, but even The Haunting was scarier. Although this IS a well-made film, it fails to deliver on the scary promises; and [SPOILER ALERT] 3) Ripped off surprise ending. 6th sense was soooo much better (as anything is when it's fresh)"
3,Original?,"This film is not original. One reviewer said, ""An original twist on a familiar theme"". How is that possible? The theme is the old ""Sixth sense"" surprise...Oh, look who's dead, look who's alive! Already done recently so when I saw this film, it totally bored me and when the ""surprise"" ending came, I was not surprised. My only surprise is how many people think this is a good, original film. Maybe I'm dead as I write this review..."
3,Good But Not As Good As Everyone Says...,"The Others starring Nicole Kidman (Moulin Rouge, Eyes Wide Shut) was really a let down. I had heard too many good things about it, but when I seen it I thought it was a disappointment. The ending is great, it really catches you off guard. I guess the ending is what made me leaving the theater ""satisfied"", but no more. The movie was said to be ""scary"", ""creepy"", ""edge of your seat entertainment"". When I left the theater all I felt was that numbness in my legs. Don't be fooled, ""The Others"" is good entertainment, but don't expect much else. The fact of all the OSCAR talk for Kidman's performance was stupid. She is okay in the movie, but nothing OSCAR worthy.If you just want to see a fairly decent movie on a snowy or rainy Sunday night, I would recommend it. But as for buying it on video or DVD, I would say no. However, if the DVD has enough special features, I MIGHT rent it. I hope my review was helpful."
2,"Bad story, bad ending, no redeeming value","There's nothing pleasant, happy, or redeeming about this movie. There were tons of positive reviews for this movie on Amazon, but why would anyone like a movie about a mom who murders her kids and everyone from beginning to end is miserable? Terrible movie."
1,"Surprising ending the first time only. Otherwise, boredom.","After a long, tedious viewing experience, a surprise ending was in store, upon viewing for the first time, that made it almost worth watching, once. This is pure rental material only, IF THAT. If you become easily bored, this is not the movie for you. And because the surprise ending is really the only thing going for it, which is not a surprise after the first viewing, this has zero repeat viewing value. Pass on this one."
2,The Others Bereft of Themes and Ideas,"A slow, pretentious, academic film, The Others is enslaved to a single gimmick-driven plot with no character development and no real theme. In other words, The Others has nothing to say, so you have to watch a group of fine actors go through their perfunctory duties in order that the plot, in all of its self-congratulatory cleverness, is fulfilled. But what a long wait for the movie viewer, who must languish through all the cliches and bathos and paper-thin characters! And for what? There's no thematic pay-off here, no real idea. Finally, this is a very stiff and stage-bound film that is too self-conscious to jump out and connect with the viewer."
3,The Others DVD,"There were a few scratches on the DVD but it still plays ok. It did not come with the DVD cover, (which is kind of a bummer) but I can't remember if it stated that in the description or not? All in all, the DVD is ok."
4,Freaky Twice at Most!,"""The Other's"" came out in 2001 and has been by far a scary movie if you see it two times at the most. Nicole Kidman is a mother of two who lives in a large home in New England. The hous becomes haunted once the ""home workers"" come to work with the home. After many haunts through the few days...Nicole Kidman comes across a book...""The Book of the Dead"". It's contents are pictures of those dead and are in the book to help them in the afterlife. Nicole Kidman is suspicious when the mail with the ad for home maitainance had never been delivered but the workers were there...in the room where they stayed, there was a pcture of three dead people. The picture was the three workers.....they explain that Nicole Kidman and their family are.....dead.............find out more with ""The Others""!"
4,Better than I exspected,"At first glance of this movie I thought it would be decent, but not scary at all. Most so-called ""Thrillers"" or ""Horrors"" with big name actors are far from scary. However this movie did give me a couple creeps. It's not really scary, and if your not into intelligent movies with alot of talking than this isn't for you. Although it lacks fast paced sceens for most of the movie, the 3 or 4 sceens that are fast paced are very good and the suspense of the sceens really comes through the screen at you. What really makes the movie is the ending, its the kind of ending that your just like ""WOW"". You don't see it coming at all, and it really catches you off guard. I wish I could have rated it 4.5 stars, but since I cant Ill rate it 4 because it lacks those face paced sceens and without them it doesnt deserve the 5. But its a very good movie and I suggest buying the DVD or Video."
5,Ultimate Ghost Story!,"I saw this twice in theatres. Most people told how it was so ""predictable"". In all truth, no one could predict the final five minutes of the film when all is revealed. It's a ""more than you see"" type of story. I loved it! This and ""Moulin Rouge"" heightened my respect for Nicole Kidman."
4,Worth Watching,"Despite the rather dull title, and the fact that it very nearly put me off spending 8 bucks at the movies, I am very glad I did; although I wouldn't personally class it as a ""thriller"", there were certainly some tense moments.The movie only really comes together at the end-which I think makes it all the more enjoyable-no predictable plots or cliche lines, and a sharp twist to finish it off.The actors, especially the two English kids are superb, as are the rest of the cast.I was convinced from the scenery, that the film was made in England-wrong, Spain.I really recommend this film, you definitely will not regret buying it. I watched it twice at the movies."
4,Very Good Ghost Story,"I'm not a fan of slasher, slice 'em and dice 'em films, so this was definitely up my alley. While it's definitely a bit of a 'Sixth Sense' spin-off, it manages some great creepy moments and eerie scenes. Not mind, I'm NOT a fan of Nicole Kidman, so there were some painful moments for me, but even though she's in the leading role, it was very good."
4,"4 out of 5, but STILL THE BEST","Yeah I have it 4 stars because it does kind of drag in the beginning.. However once you pay attention, you cant let go.."
4,A better than expected thriller,"After hearing all the hype surrounding The Others I finally decided to give it a look and found it better than what I had expected. Nicole Kidman plays a religious mother living in her large home on the island of Jersey in 1945 with her two children, both of which suffer from a disorder where they blister and turn very sick from being exposed to too much sunlight. When Kidman hires some new servants strange things start going on, and an otherworldly presence is felt. Kidman is great in her role as an overbearing mother who really does love her children, but takes it to a new level. Director/writer Alejandro Amenabar (who wrote and directed Open Your Eyes which would be re-made as Vanilla Sky) effectively uses atmosphere over flashy special effects to achieve a chilling tale of mystery and suspense with a twist ending that seemingly comes from nowhere. All in all, anyone looking for a good thriller should definitely check out The Others."
5,Love scary movies?,"Then you'll love this one. I enjoyed it better once I watched the DVD at home so I could backup in case I missed what someone said.I wasn't a Nicole Kidman fan until this movie. She did a great acting job.I love surprise endings, so this was REALLY GOOD. I never would have guessed!"
4,Chilling... Yet Not Too Chilling,"This is about the perfect thriller film for me, scary, but not scary enough to keep you awake the rest of your natural life, (although I'll admit, watching this before bed wasn't the best idea I've ever had.) Anyways, basically this film comprises elements of ""The Sixth Sense"" ""Secret Window"" ""The Village"" and some really good mystery film, and adds an eerily supernatural touch. In my opion, this film contained one of the 5 most chilling scenes I've ever seen, and no, I won't spoil it, (just beware of old people in communion gowns.) lolIn the end, this is a very worthwhile thriller, and I reccomend it."
4,Kidman shines thru the gloom...,"Eerie, atmoshpheric and so well-acted this DVD is a sure bet for any videophiles collection.This one will keep you guessing til the very end!"
3,THE OTHERS,"I watched this film because of the trailer which I found quite interesting. The film is about a mother with two children and a husband who's away at the war. At the end of the film, there were a few questions which were unanswered. I did not quite get the end of the film and it seemed more hurried than anything. The screenplay of this movie is good but all in all there's not much in it. It's not the kind of film you'd talk to people about. There were two scenes in the film that made me jump and if I say I was not frightened, I'd be a darn liar.Watch this film if only you are as curious as I am and like Nicole Kidman in a similar way.A five star film I would recommend to anyone who liked The Others would have to be ""The Village"""
4,Just an old fashioned ghost story,"I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie. Current horror films depend so much on effects that good story telling is sacraficed. To begin with, the setting and house evoke a creepy, calmness that stays throughout the film. The pale, yellowish lighting adds shadows which are both scary and beautiful. The images are almost like engravings. Kidman portrays a character that is not particularly sympathetic but is increasingly appealing as the movie plays out. The children are like figures from Charles Dickens in their innocence. The household staff often are witnesses to what appears to be a seriously dysfunctional family, however, even their smiles seem strangely weird. With a great twist at the end the viewer is given that rare treat by current standards-just a good old fashioned horror picture."
5,Not 13,"I'm not 13. i just don't want to sign in.""The Others"" is my favourite film ever, and I have seen it many times. But I have always wondered one thing. For somebody who seems to prize silence highly, Grace Stewart slams a lot of doors"
4,Surprising!,"I found this movie to be very well written and thought out! I always love movies where the ending surprises me, and The Others definitely did that.The Others isn't your typical ghost story either. As someone who believes in ""the spirit realm"", I can tell that the writers did their homework on the subject matter (but again, that fact didn't come together for me until the end).Great movie despite whether or not you believe in ghosts!"
3,"1/2 rating for movie, 1/2 rating for disc by seller","Although this is a fun story that had me fooled right up to the last part and it looked good with some judder my rating is 1/2 for the movie that I would go with a 4 star and 1/2 for the seller: Source Media who listed this movie ""Used Like New"" when in fact it is so badly scratched that the 2nd extras disc would not play unless U eject the disc and restart for each selection! This is false advertising, it is not ""Like New"" it is ""Acceptable!"" in that the movie does play but not the 2nd disc. This is a 2 disc Collector Edition. So this is my item rating."
3,Well made but I found it predictable,A well made movie and Nicole Kidman gives a good performance. My problem is that I found the movie tended to telegraph the twists and I figured out what was coming next each time. I enjoyed this movie once on a plane but I have not added to my collection.
3,Wasen't this just done...?,"in a movie called the ""Sixth Sense?"" You know, with that kid actor who loved his mommy so in ""A.I."" I believe We, as a people, has lost touch about what's scary in a movie nowadays. This movie is not scary, just depressing. One scene the curtains are supposed to be covering the windows. But then the kids screaming. Kidman comes running into the room horrified to see... The curtains have been taken down. C'mon, it's been done countless times in numerous movies. Want to see a scary house? Watch ""The Shining."" Meanwhile, Nicole will just keep pumping out movie after movie and, by the way, who's watching her kids?"
2,This movie ...,"I don't know what people saw in this movie I really don't. There is not much of a plot, the acting is really boring and there is not one real scare in the entire movie. Nicole Kidman looks good as usual but seems to me she did this one just for the paycheck. Skip this movie and rent something really suspenseful like ""The Legend of Hell House"". 2 out of 5."
2,This is a boring ghost movie.,"I bought Mick Martin & Marsha Porter's Video & DVD 2003 Guide about a month ago and they actually gave this movie 5 stars. They even said that this was an ""ultraspooky ghost story"". But in my opinion, this movie was way too long and boring. I went with my family to see it in the theater and I didn't like it a whole lot. It did have a couple of jump scenes and a very unpredictable ending, but the film took too long and I nearly fell asleep watching it. Rent this movie before you consider buying it. Some people liked this movie, others did not. Rent it, and if you like it and wish to buy it, then feel free to do so. As for me, I've seen a lot better than this. The acting is pretty good, the plot is convincing, but the movie lacks in action and suspense. It only picks up near the end."
1,DONT BUY THIS FILM,"I kid you not, this movie is horrible. It is slow developing, predictable, not scary, and just plain stupid. It is hard to classify something as scary when there is nothing scary and it takes the movie 2 hours to get to the only slightly surprising finale."
1,"If you have trouble sleeping, watch this one !",Not even the sound effects could keep me awake.I watched this movie with loud dolby digital sound and honoustly I fell asleep. The script is absolutely boring.Certainly not the top performance of Nicole.
2,Rentable at best,"This movie is average at best. Kidman does a good job, but the story just doesn't come across very well and she has to carry the whole thing. If you want to rent this go ahead but, I certainly wouldn't spend money to own it."
4,stylistic and fine,"The Others is a directorial triumph for Alejandro Amenabar, as the film succeeds at maintaining a certain level of emotional intensity throughout. Grace (Nicole Kidman) is an overprotective mother, shielding her two light sensitive children from the outside world. She hires several people to assist in care of the children and household, but these servants share a certain secret, protecting both Grace and the children from the reality of what is happening. The pace of the film is slow but measured, the characters convey the intensity and sometimes terror of what they feel; Nicole Kidman particularly ratchets up the level of intensity and territorialism, acting as a mother in the most protective and frenzied manner. The reality of the situation finally comes to light at the end, one of the psychological twists one expects from a particularly well done film. The film is a fine cinematic achievement."
4,"Una interpretación magistral, una gran película.","Amenabar consigue con su tercer filme su trabajo mas redondo, con la ayuda de la soberbia interpretación de una Nicole Kidman que firma uno de los mejores trabajos de su carrera. Muy correctos todos los secundarios. El suspense se mantiene a la perfeccion todo el filme; solo la sensacion de un final ya visto empaña un poco la linea argumental. A pesar de ello, muy recomendable para ver."
4,Slick Take On a Classic Genre,"I'm not going to repeat the praise of other 4/5 star reviews, although everything they say definitely stands. I'd just like to say that 'The Others' proves that the genre of the 'haunted house movie' can be replicated with real panache in the 21st century. The slow, suspenseful build up, sometime shocks, twists and turns follow the conventions of the genre very stylishly. Anyone who felt this film 'plodding' probably doesn't appreciate the slow build up of suspense required to be effectve with this kind of story. Go and see it, and the best advice I can give, is don't bother trying to guess the twists in the tale, just allow yourself to sit back and be entertained. Another piece of advice is: don't read any of the negative reviews here before you see the movie, because from what i've read on these pages, many of those who didn't enjoy it seem determined to selfishly reveal vital plot points to people without considering that this totally ruins a movie for most of us."
2,Lack of Entertainment,"My friends and I rushed to this movie the first day it came out. Talk about disappoinment. The movie dragged on for about an hour and there was only 2 scenes that was interesting (but I fell asleep on one of the 2 scenes and missed it, but I was told it wasn't much). Save your money and wait for the DVD. The scenes cut out of the movie might be more interesting than the scenes left in the movie."
1,"Wake me when it's over, please!","Scary? No. Suspenceful? No. Thrilling? No. Worth watching? No. Well, what was it then? It was better than counting sheep! Good nite!"
2,scary only if..,scary only if you had already been told all about the movie before you actually saw it.
2,poorly done version of this sort of movie,"A poorly done version of this sort of movie. It just didn't have it. Not much scare, not much atmosphere, not much suspense, just ended up being very bland. I had had high hopes for it too."
1,Don't Bother,Watched part of it. Have no interest in watching the rest of it. Turned it off and went to bed. This isn't even close to being in the same class as The Sixth Sense.
3,"Not The Best, Not the Worst","From the beginning, it wasn't a truly captivating movie. The Others tries to be a ""Sixth Sense"" story remade. Not that it was glaringly apparent from the start, but at one point you know whats coming. There were also confusing moments that didnt coincide with the reaminder of the film. Also, the fact that God is protrayed as ""non-existent"" or ""uncaring"" did not bode well with my conscious."
3,Good but not original,"This was a good movie with twist ending. But the twist, I fear, is a little too similar to another recent movie. That's why I've rated it 3 stars, instead of the 4 it might otherwise deserve. I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen it so I won't mention the name of the other movie. Despite it's similar surprise, it still held my interest, and had enough of it's own merit to recommend. It also provided a bit of insight in the area of the paranormal that I'd never seen explored before.It was good. It was creepy. It just wasn't as completely original as I had hoped."
2,"Disappointing ""thriller""","I was expecting a really scary, thrilling flick and got a half-baked fright. The only ""scary"" part was the ""I am your daughter"" and even that I laughed at. The whole film was a spin-off of the wildly frightening, ""Sixth Sense."" The movie tried a twisted ending, but it was just too easy to predict. I don't like this movie at all and don't recommend it."
2,Extremely well-acted movie but...,"THIS MOVIE MAKES NO SENSE!!!ending spoiler warning!In the ending, it reveals that Nicole Kidman's character suffered nervous breakdown since her husband left home for war, accidently killed her kids during their sleep, and then shot herself... despite the mirror scenes that reflected Nicole Kidman's character and the closed door that was wide (or nearly) open! And what else!? a scene where she and her daughter talked about a Nicholas situation w/ a crying voice is where you look closely Kidman is reflected at the wide stony glass above the fireplace! How could they be dead if she was reflected by mirrors!? This movie doesn't want to thrill you into chills, but wants you to feel impressed by the ending despite the faulty scenes I told you about! What an unforgivable mistake!Acting: 4 1/2 out of 5. Plot: 1 OUT OF 5!! Overall: 2/5 b/c of outstanding talents from actors, in my humble opinion"
1,Garbage! Pure garbage!,"I should think that Tom Cruise who is credited with being an executive producer and Nicole Kidman who starred in this film would be embarrassed for anyone to see it, but they probably have no shame. This is a dark, dreary, and slow-moving movie filled with hard-to-understand dialog and not much of a story line anyway. Save your money and put your time to better use. It simply boggles my mind that so many reviewers gave it more than one star. If I could have, I'd have put it into the minus column, because I'm angry at myself for watching it all the way through."
2,"Good concept, badly done","This is a psychological thriller. Scary but no gore- how I prefer it. Problem being? Nicole Kidman's terrible from beginning to end. The movie is set back before electricity existed and men were away at war, so the dialogue and the children are pretty boring and minimal. Everything is focused around the dictator-like character Nicole tries to play. Yawn. The best parts of this movie are what you saw in the trailer for it! It drags on until the plot twist which reminded me of another certain movie that it worked a LOT better for. Rent this movie if you like these types of movie's but really, don't expect much or you'll be very disappointed. And irritated about the wasted time you can never get back!"
3,Twilight Zone revisited,"The movie reminds me of a twilight zone episode. The whole deal is to keep you in suspense and then spring the surprise on you at the end. I don't think most people will be that surprised. It's a very well made movie. The acting by Kidman and the kids is very good. The setting, the music, the direction, is all very good. It's just a weak premise to support a movie. This would have worked much better as an hour long ""novella"" of sorts. It really doesn't have enough going for it to support a movie length presentation. The director does a great job with the shots he chooses and since he also wrote the score, he sets up the atmosphere of the movie very well.I would recommend it for a rental but I don't think it has too much replay value."
5,warning about the dvd,"I just got done watching this movie. As I do with any new dvd I looked at the scene selections first. DON'T!! If you have not seen this movie before (I had not, I missed it when it was out so I had no idea how it ended) don't look at the scene selections first!! If you look at them before you watch the movie you will know about the ""twist"" at the end. I did like the movie, even though I ruined the ending for myself. Nicole Kidman was OUTSTANDING!! The children were wonderful!! It's a great movie, just don't look at the scene selections first!!"
4,"In the tradition of well written, well acted horror movies this","one is up there with Rosemary's Baby, one of my favorite movies. Nicole was terrific as the lost soul, along with her two anemic looking children, who don't realize they are dead. I don't want want to spoil it but I think you'll enjoy this one. No blood or gore, just a good story and good acting. Enjoy!"
3,WEAK GHOST STORY,"Perhaps, I was not in the mood; but this entry in the William James look-a-like contest just did not make it with me. No particular complaints, I simply was not caught up in the whirl of creaks and groans. The cast did well enough with what they had to work with, but they were not able to create the aura of mystery and suspense needed to induce the necessary spell."
4,Turn of the Screw type film,"Overall a decent film although as one reviewer put it, it shouldn't take you too long to figure out what the twist at the end is. Years back I read a short ghost story from the Edwardian/late Victorian era which is obviously the source of this film, otherwise you could say this film has an almost Henry James Turn of the Screw type atmosphere. The acting is pretty good although the sound and visual effects are pretty much standard for this genre. Altogether a well balanced film, Kidman and Mann both deliver very well - the ending has a twist as said before but for me it seemed more of an anticlimax and quite predictable."
3,Pretty Good,The Others is a fairly good movie but has a very stupid ending.Well I give 3 stars and rent it but don't buy it.
4,SUSPENSEFUL!,"The first time I saw the others, I watched it in surround sound in the dark. It was suspenseful but, not scary. Plus it has creepy eerie music in the back round for pretty much the whole film."
4,SPOOKY!,"What a wonderful throwback to truly atmospheric horror films! Forget about the Sixth Sense comparisons. There are 2 twists in this story, and the 2nd will make you gasp."
4,it's just like...,"...this is a good movie, very good budget to box office ratio. Actually very successful...the music sounded like James Horner, the lighting looked like the man who cried, acting was like that movie exorcist, and the kids were like from that commercial, and the house was definitely from the english scene in pearl harbor..."
4,An o.k performance,"The others wasn't that scary, but it managed to leave you hanging. In the begining Everything is confusing, but that all ends when the real plot comes in. The old lady in the dress is what freaked me out the most aside from the dead people coming after the mother and children. Nicole Kidman did a excellent job in this movie, and I love her hair blond."
4,A Good Scary Movie,"When I saw this movie, what struck me the most was that this was a good scary movie that didn't need gore or a demonic lunatic that can't die. It wasn't a teenager slasher flick rather it was a dark, well-developed horror/suspense that raised the hair on my neck without grossing me out."
4,Interesting twist!,"I liked this movie, could have used a tad more movement but otherwise well done. The conclusion was a dandy and I didn't expect that at all."
4,Atmospheric Thriller,"The Others is not so much a horror as a tense and involving mystery. It didn't keep me awake at night, because it brings you down nicely, I felt, but I definately chewed my knuckles throughout it. It was a classic example of how what you don't see is often more frightening than what you do. The bumps and the slamming doors, the constant lack of light, the perpetually heavy fog, and the spooky understatement of the servants, (yes, Fionnula Flannagan can be scary, remarkably) were far worse than a bunch of digital ghosts could have been. And Nicole Kidman was great, wonderfully intense and completely loopy, and tottering around the house all day. The children's photosensitivity was an inspired touch, since keeping everything in the dark only increased the claustrophobia of the creaky old mansion. The cinematography is evocative and atmospheric."
5,What a GREAT suprise!,"The Others is a quality thriller that is smart(the twist at the endmakes you think the WHOLE movie over) and beautiful(the foggy atmosphereand light-deprived house are perfect). Nicole Kidman should have beennominated for and winner of an Oscar for her role as the strained motherGrace. This movie is a GREAT treatthat stands out from all the flashy Hollywood junk. And while I jumped afew times and got chills, this movie won't be keeping me up for nightsto come."
3,ATMOSPHERIC,"This movie reeks of atmosphere, from the constant fog outside to the spartan grey interiors. Did I mention the fog? The director likes fog and in a special feature he shows how he created the fog effects. In segment after segment he shows us. It was sorta neat the first couple of times, but really it's just fog. Like others, I wondered why there are two DVDs. The extras don't really merit a full DVD. I also had some problems with the sound.Bearing all this in mind, the movie is good. The ending didn't suprise me. I figured it out about halfway through. My advice-don't think and you will be suprised. Kidman and the children give good performances. This movie is entertaining, but not very rewatchable."
5,It seems you either like this one or hate it,"I loved it! I really didn't see any previews for this one and bought it pre-viewed from my video store. Perhaps the ending was slightly predictable, but I honestly didn't see it coming. I seriously enjoyed it and have recommended it to anyone that likes a good ghost story."
4,Only downside? It's only one disc!,"Masterbeat's ""The Club"" series is by far the most practical of their releases based on the desire to get hard-to-find, popular club trax. They're always major anthems, great vocal and attitude. And this volume is no exception, with the great razor and guido mix of Kathy Brown (over EIGHT minutes!) the remix of Underworld, and a non-single track by Kevin Aviance. But volumes 1 and 3 are both TWO discs for just about the same price! Track times:1. ready set go (7:25)2. bucci bag (6:40)3. turn me out (8:20)4. dangerous (6:43)5. all I want (5:24)6. magnifique (9:21)7. feelin you (8:22)8. after all (8:49)9. two months off (6:23)10. into the sun (6:36)"
1,More great Tinkers ....with a serious/fatal flaw...,"All the good stuff there is to say about the Tinkers' second album has been said in the reviews below, and I agree with all of it. Unfortunately, this otherwise 5-star CD is seriously (some would say fatally) marred by the inclusion of two tracks, ""The Farmer"" and ""Those Marching O'Neills"". The former is a song that appeals to childish ""just discovering dirty innuendo"" tastes, and the latter is a cacaphonous scrambling of the former. One hopes that the Tinkers' next album won't have such trash on it. In the meantime, burn a CD copy without these two tracks, and then enjoy truly great and innovative performances. Caveat emptor!"
1,Good performance....but fatally flawed by smut......,"Why on earth the Tinkers, who are otherwise terrific performers, chose to include an infantile vocal track (the kind considered risque at the elementary school level) defies the imagination....and then to repeat it in garbled form as the final track! Their first CD was a true revelation.....this one's a bummer."
4,This album is Wicked!,"This second album from the Wicked Tinkers is awesome. It will start your feet a-tapping. It is all Wicked Tinkers - fun, loud, upbeat - a party of music. Scots and non-Scots will enjoy it. The album has a variety - from lively jigs to slow love songs. ""Aaron & Leza"" is a beautiful song and a wonderful tribute to the couple. ""Those Marching O'Neills"" is a real stompin' song. And, of course, ""The Farmer"" is a funny favorite. This album has something for everyone - it is a great buy! P.S., wait after the end of the last song for a bit of fun."
5,BOO!,"Any one hooked on the new TV show Medium will want to read Ghostly Antiques by Jennifer Robins. This readable novel can be enjoyed in one sitting. I know. I sat down and read it from cover to cover in one afternoon.Whether you believe in psychometry or a person's ability to receive messages from objects or you don't you will be engaged in this heart warming story about how a widow copes with the loss of her husband and the rest of her life looming large before her. Nice job, Jennifer Robins!"
1,Worst Summerslam of All Time,This PPV was just really bad from top to bottomCena vs Orton far below expectationsKhali vs Batista HORRIBLE ATROCIOUSChavo Vs Rey Mysterio decent but they cant touch the bar they set back in WCW for great matches theses daysBooker vs HHH glorified squash for the returning HHHUmaga vs Carlito vs Mr. Kennedy decentPunk vs Morrison best of the night two future main event starsDiva Battle Royal Divas havnt been the same since Trish and Lita leftoverall just an atrocious Summerslam pass on it
2,Terrible Summerslam,"1. Kane vs FinlayIt was an ok opening match, but nothing special. 3.5/52. Triple Threat Match for the Intercontinental Championship: Umaga(c) vs Mr. Kennedy vs CarlitoSlow paced match with Umaga. 2/53. Rey Mysterio vs Chavo GuerreroNot their greatest match, but I thought it was pretty good. Rey Returns! 4/54. Divas Battle RoyalJust thrown in to take up time. 1.5/55. ECW Championship: John Morrison(c) vs CM Punk2nd best match of the night, two great superstars. 4/56. Triple H vs King BookerHHH returns and King Booker's last match in the WWE.

WWE Championship: John Cena(c) vs Randy OrtonSome people might not have liked it, but I enjoyed it. Match of the night 5/5Overall: 24.5/40 61% This was a horrible Summerslam. Not a great one to get."
5,Be Not Afraid--He Was Right,Beautiful...a beautiful way to begin the new millennium as we reflect upon excerpts from our most fearless and patient leader.A priest read a page at a mass during a homily and I was hooked on the idea to make this a daily devotional part of my prayers. These short insights into the human condition allow me to pray for us all.
1,don't believe what ya see,"all you'' get is just the video noy the other items that came with this ultamite fan set, no shirt, no armband no nothing , IF THIS IS ADVENTISED DON'T YA THINK inluding the items listed would help boost your ranking"
4,Perfect for a wrestling fan!,My teenage son loves wrestling and he had asked for this video for several weeks. I ordered it and was pleasantly surprised when it arrived before the date promised. My son loved it! It has wrestling matches but also interviews with Rey Mysterio and other wrestlers...a Mysterio fan's dream!
5,Good service,Good service. Rey Mysterio is a great wrestler. This 3 disc collection is well worth buying. 619 all the time!
1,Failed the MPRE!,"This book covered a lot of what was not on the MPRE, and very little of what was. After studying the book, I aced the practice MPRE that was provided. I went into the MPRE confident that I was going to do just as well. However, the actual MPRE bore little semblance to anything I had been prepared for. Bottom line: I'll be taking the MPRE again. Thank you and goodbye Supreme Review, hello BarBri."
1,What a rip off.,"I really disagree with the other reviews so I had to write. The main value of this book is the sample questions. Come to find out - the writers did not even bother to change the ORDER of the sample MPRE questions available for free on the MPRE website. What an insult. Furthermore, I thought the lecturer was a total zone out bore who did nothing more than read the too-abbreviated outline. Don't waste your money on this book. Just go to the free test on the MPRE website, and use the Emmanuel flashcards - which are way more comprehensive."
4,On the young side,"The topics are diverse and comprehensive, but in actually implementing the curriculae, it seemed disjointed and to not ""flow"" well from one session to the next. Perhaps it's better to use as a lesson plan for a much more structured group than I customarily facilitate. The kids enjoyed the activities, and many of them can be pulled out to use in other ways. Although it says for elementary level, As a whole, the most activities were too young for many of my 4th graders, and all of the 5th and 6th graders (they thought the activities were silly.) Overall, I would recommend it - it's structured for 8 sessions per topic, but better for 1st through 3rd, and some of 4th graders."
5,Nicely done Gilmour,This is a very good solid unit and gets the job done. I replaced a plastic coupler with this and it does not leak. Great quality product.
1,THIS IS NOT NEEDED .. it's the wrong connection,Based on someone else's review stating you will need a male/male connector I ordered this .. it doesn't fit anything on the sprayer .. $8 down the drain so to say ... nice brass but not needed .. at all. If you buy one you would need male/female based on the connections I have on the washer.
4,"OK writing, great science","Reading this ""popular science"" book, written by one of the greatest contemporary chemical physicists, was both difficult and satisfying. To avoid a fit of sycophancy, let's just say that I wish I had it when taking my postgrad Statistical Mechanics class. The only negative thing I can cay about this book is that the discussion is somewhat eclectic; it often oscillates between almost trivial philosophy and very high-level, cutting-edge science. It is not clear what the reader is expected to know before starting on this book. That said, if you can work your way through it, you will likely come out with a new understanding of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and the physics of complex systems."
2,Uneven,"As someone with a fair amount of scientific background I must say that this book, which purports to be aimed at a general audience, contains a considerable amount of material that is less than clear. The author suddenly transitions from prose to mathematics on a number of occasions and often leaves it to the reader to construct understanding. Scientists often fail to take account of their audience and are, in effect, trained by example in both written and verbal communication to make little effort to construct clear explanations. As an effort to communicate clearly with non-scientists, this book is quite a bit less than successful although it contains material of substantial interest. Not recommended for the general reader."
3,All of this has been said before,"If you want a simple, elegant, responsible, well-informed book on the origin of the macroscopic arrow of time and on how time-revesibility at the microscopic level resolves many of the quantum paradoxes, read Physics Prof. Victor Stenger's ""Timeless Reality"". You will get much more out of it."
4,Soup Sales Fan,It was great to see Soup Sales again. This video brings back some very happy moments in my life. He was a GREAT entertainer.Amazon was excellent as usual. Deliver was on-time.
4,Blankety Blank,"A blank is a blank is a blank. This is a blank...but it's a good blank. Middle Atlantic makes some great product, and as far as blanks go, this is decent."
4,great for wasps,"These are great for yellowjacket/wasp control. They don't kill them directly, but they stun the wasp, then I step on it to finish it off. This is a safe and easy way to rid your outdoor meal of wasps. We used one on a camping trip, at a group site with lots of wasps. Usually, 5 or 6 wasps would show up as soon as we tried to eat. This made it easy to kill them off, and we could eat in peace. If a few more came a bit later, we could just zap them too. The kids were fighting to get a turn! It would be better if it killed the wasps directly, but I still love it! Now we can enjoy our meal without people stressing and walking around trying to avoid the wasps."
2,useless for bigger flyes,"protective grid prevents bigger bugs (and sometimes even small mosquitoes) from getting fried. the grid that is designed to protect you, protects also your target. i'm thinking about cutting the protective grids off."
4,satisfactory,"This product was as represented and worked well. I ordered 2 on May 19 for $5.99 each. Came back to order 2 more on June 4. Price had increased to $11.99 each. Today, June 12, they are $15.59 each. On June 4 decided to order 2 $5.50 from another Amazon store. Those were only 1/2 the size of these. Was going to order 2 more today of the smaller ones, because they do work even though small. Price on the small ones increased to $9.99 each only 7 days after my order. What's up with so many changes in such short times?"
5,AWSOME!!!,"Although it appears cheaply made, I had to tighten a few screws and then it was good as new, and yes, It works AWSOME! I own a bugzooka also, which is good for the crawly bugs, but flies are too fast, and this little charms takes care of that problem, if you can swat a fly or corner one, they are as good as dead, this will fry them, and it works on knats, spiders, bees, wasp etc. this is a must have for barbacues and camping, and its addicting watching bugs fry, sorry! :)"
1,Didn't Work,"Received the bug zapper, put in the batteries and nothing. It did not work. The batteries were new so I know it wasn't the batteries. It would cost me more to return it than it's worth."
4,It works as expected.,"While I agree the shipped packaging should be a little sturdier, it arrived without damage. (The mailer was a little torn, but it got here alright.)I've got small hovering flys that hang in areas of shadows, quite often near doorways.They drive me nuts. On day 1, this product racked up 4 on first attempts.One survived the initial ""crack"", but still was able to get it on second attempt.I was pleasantly surprised to find it even grabbed a gnat!So much bettter than trying to use swatters, or worse, poisons."
3,"Works for Larger Bugs, Not For Noseeums","Dear Friends:This works well for larger bugs, but I had hoped it would also work for smaller ones. As far as I can tell, it does not work for noseeums at all. They just fly through the gaps in the wires.Otherwise the device works fine. As other commenters have said, you will need to be aware that the door in front of the battery space falls out from time to time. Might be best to tape it shut."
1,DEFECTIVE Zappers sent!,"I was so excited to get my zappers in the mail after getting eaten by black flies all summer. I get the package and BOTH of the zappers did not work. I contacted GammaDiscount and they said I would have to send them back ($9.95 for USPS shipping) for them to determine if they were defective. So they finally reimbursed me the amount for the zappers but NOT for the shipping. So basically I got ripped off and had to pay $9.95 for this entire wonderful experience. Oh yeah and I find out in their disclaimer that they are not responsible for reimbursing the shipping costs for the buyer to send it back. They couldn't even respond to my two emails. Thanks GammaDiscount, you are a horrible seller."
4,Bug Zapper,A sister in law had something like this and it actually sparked up a few bugs for me. I was skeptical that this one would work but gave it a try. I does work and I get great pleasure out of watching mosquitoes spark up and die in the mesh. Not really sure why this one needs a little flash light in the handle.
3,Not as great as the other Dora books,This one had too many characterizing know. And in the jungle it was hard to see their names. It didn't hold my daughter's attention as well. But we do love the participation factor.
5,I like the honesty here,"This cd is half poetry half interesting beats. I love finding independent artists who have something really original to convey, and David Dondero is definitely one of them. For anyone who's looking for that new cd to play over and over again, I recommend giving this one a try!"
5,Great Singer-Songwriter,"David is a classic singer-songwriter with great lyrics and catchy tunes. South of the South refers to Florida, which is one of the best tracks on the cd. Each song tells a great story and he has a very unique style all his own."
3,Reviewing for CTEL exams...,maybe the only book out there for reviewing for the CTel/CLAD exams. Not organized for easy organized learning but not too bad. I haven't heard the results of the exams yet...
4,A Great Resource Book,"I purchased this book for a college class and it was mostly review from other classes. However, I found the book easy to read and very informative. This single book covered about 4 or 5 other books from different courses. If you are a beginning teacher that wants to be able to teach to all of your students, than this book is a must. This great book covers SDAIE teaching and just other great concepts. If you have never taken a multilinguial course than this is money well spent. If you have had a number of those types of classes, than I would look for a book more catered to what you need. This is book is a great introductory book. Most students that I had in class kept the book as reference material and that says a lot because we use book money to live on until finicial aide comes in, LOL."
2,More K than 12,"Although this book calls itself a complete K-12 handbook, in reality it is much more geared toward lower elementary school than high school."
3,The most evil villains I have ever read.,"I have read five of the ""Prey"" novels so far, including these three stories. Obviously, there is something about them that I find attractive, but in retrospect, I cannot honestly say what. The writing style is pleasant, but not taxing, and draws you along. The villains are the most evil people that I have ever read about, and always come to the same end. The number of psychos inhabiting John Sandford's Midwest is truly frightening, yet doesn't seem to surprise the locals. These books are the ""sitcom-lites"" of literature, but easy and quick to read."
2,Quite alright,"This song is good but it's not that great comparing to Dj Quicksilver or Ayla. It sounds interesting, groovy at first but listen a little bit more, it might make you go to sleep because of the monotonous tone. If you'd like to buy this cd listen to others first."
1,Not as Fresh as Nativas Brand,"After first trying Nativas Brand of Raw Cacao Nibs, I was excited to find this brand, which is the brand started by Raw Food Guru David Wolfe, so I expected it to be a 5 Star brand. Quite the opposite.Nativas Brand: Fresh, Aromaticvs.Sunfiod: Rotten, Not Aromatic, StaleWill not by sunfood brand again and go back to Nativas."
5,L.A.C.A --,"I've listened to L.A.C.A I couldn't tell you how many times now, and each time I here it, I like it even better than the last. Desiree, you have done a great job with this one! For those of you who don't know her yet -- You really are missing something. The blend on this CD is awsome! Love Hold Tight!"
5,Excelent Video quality,I was very pleased with the quality of the video. In the past I have found some cantinflas movie to be of very poor video quality. Very happy wth this product.
4,A little pricey,I thought I was getting two for this price. But the option of just buying the head vs. a complete brush is very unique. Bed Bath & Beyond use to sell them in the store. Wish they still did.
2,Disappointing,"All the positive reviews are true. It's captivating and beautifully written, what there is of it. But the story of the three children's search for their birthparents is hastily glued on to the front of the book. As many reviewers mentioned, the story isn't about them at all. It's about the birthparents who they will presumably never learn about. Why do that without telling us anything about the lives those children ended up having, especially since the older ones remember their difficult beginning? The ending seemed abrupt and disappointing, as it left me with many questions about those children and how this beginning affected their lives. It seemed like half a book, and the other half promised to be even more interesting."
3,Brazilian Variety,"Any recording by this legendary bossa nova guitarist/composer commands a curious ear. As a bossa nova collector, I found only two bossa tracks. The vocals (many) were weak. He is no Joao Gilberto. The version of Wave was way too slow for my taste. Wave is not a ballad. Otherwise, great arrangements, and a very clean and crisp guitar sound from this Brazilian musical legend."
3,Useful recipes,"This book has some fine recipes in it, but I'm only giving it three stars because it appears to be more of a marketing tool than a collection of recipes. It does contain many helpful hints for the use and care of Le Creuset cookware, but the recipes are arranged according to various Le Creuset products (french ovens, buffet casseroles, tagines, skillet grills, etc.) Less experienced cooks may be led to believe that one must use only the Le Creuset product listed for each recipe. This slender volume is sometimes included as a free bonus when buying various Le Creuset items, and that would give it five stars. As a stand-alone volume, it falls short."
5,3ds max 7 Fundamentals and Beyond Courseware,This book is great learnd so much and esy to follow. Amazon sent exactly what I orderd and in a timely manner. All in All compleatly satisfied.
5,great dvd,Lionel Hampton was truly a very talented musician and this film show cases the greatness of Lionel Hampton's own talent and his band. i got the honor to see Lionel Hampton in concert a decade ago and he always had command of the vibes and this dvd shows his rich depth and talents and also as a arranger and he had a pressence on stage.
5,Whiskey & The Devil,"This album is simply amazing. They have done it again. Cave Catt Sammy is by far one of the best Rockabilly bands out there. They have their sound down for sure. If you like rockabilly this album is for you! Each song is great. These guys are also amazing to see live. I hope they release a new album every year, because there music is just that good."
4,Another Rockin' Record!,Cave Catt Sammy delivers another track set worthy of the band's impressive history. Just enough tone from original 'billy with just enough modern song crafting make a perfect blend.Now if I could just get a chance to see these guys live...
5,Good experience,I was very pleased with the sellers response time and the item looks to be quality. My husband ran out of the house with it I didn't have a lot of time to look at it. He's happy so I'm happy. A pleasure to do business with.
1,"Beware, this is not an OEM part","As the previous reviewers have mentioned, this is not a Rigid filter, as advertised.If I wanted to bother with a generic part, I would have ordered one. Mine's going back.I didn't read these latest reviews since I assumed I was purchasing the OEM part.Amazon needs to do better job verifying their vendors."
3,Almost Too Big Vac filter!,"The part number was correct, but to fit I had to squash the filter to fit the space. Nothing in the instructions indicated that would be necessary."
2,This is a generic replacement filter,"Not a Rigid brand filter, it's a generic replacement. Rubber seal ring on top of filter cracked after two months."
1,Fell apart,It worked well in our Rigid 16 gal wet/dry vac until it was time to clean and reuse the filter. Washable and reusable it is NOT! It literally fell apart in soggy pieces.
2,Sound Quality Lacking,"If you don't mind a CD sounding like scratchy records, this is one foryour collection. The problem is most prevalent on the recordings fromthe 40's. The recordings from the mid 50's are not as bad. Some goodvintage Dinah Shore here, but not much in the way of production value.As reviewer above mentions...there are no liner notes or informationbesides track list."
