2,This is the best of?,"Each show on the DVD had real possibilities. During the credits that run at theend of each show, you get an idea of what you missed. So many of the musical numbers that Dean did with guests were left out, while comedy sketches that didn't quite work were left in. It's great to see the stars, and perhaps leaving so muchmaterial out helps sell other products. But based on the choices of what is left out, I'd be leery of buying anything else from these folks."
1,Amazon Verified Purchase,"Wish we could have previewed. It primarily is cuts of guests, not the delightful comedy and spoofs of his show. We are so disappointed and regret buying it."
1,Condensed Dino,"What a mess! Instead of complete broadcasts, we get badly condensed episodes from Dean Martin's 1965-74 variety show. Avoid these travesties and wait for NBCUniversal to release full-season DVD sets - hopefully in this lifetime."
1,Where Is Dean?,"As one reviewer has said the best part of The Dean Martin Variety Show was DEAN. Having just watched all 6 discs I am very disappointed. Where have all the songs gone - the entry song, the song on the couch. The editing was shocking and because of it the whole feeling that was The Dean Martin Show has gone. I wish they would just release the complete shows and then all Dean's fans would be happy. What a waste of money! Certainly not my idea of The Best Of The Dean Martin Variety Show."
2,Dean Martin Vareity Show,"While I absolutely love Dean Martin, this collection is a little bit annoying. The episodes are cut so that you don't see an entire show. The order of the episodes is also put together poorly. I wold like to see the Variety Show from its inception to its end in order. However, there is nothing better than watching Dean do his thing."
3,That`s all there is so shut up!,"When this is all there is and you`re not a very patient person, you purchas what looks good. I don`t care about the missed commercials or the NBC Peacock struting it`s feathers like it`s in heat. I remember watching this show during the week night and enjoying every minute of it. So I guess I will take a chance and be quite."
3,"THE GOOD ,THE BAD, AND THE UGLY!","Five dvds in a set should have the BEST of the Dean Martin Variety TV shows. What it does include is cut versions of about twenty episodes, and as I originally saw some episodes I was disappointed to find some really funny moments I remember totally missing. It does have the essence of the Dean Martin we all know and love and there are some moments which are reasonably good including stars who are no longer with us doing their thing.....but it certainly is a mish-mash of entertainment with some of the stars announced who don't appear in the ensueing episode. Whoever put this together must have been ""on"" something. Even the extras are a little strange... although some informative .... some of the guests on the extras poorly prepared for what should have been definitive interviews.It could have been so much better."
2,the sound is awful and i can barely hear the discs,"if the discs had adequate sound they would be great, but they do notand i have been told it will cost more to have the sound improved than i spent on the set to begin with"
2,Sliced n diced.,"What a shame,just when the show starts it's over. Why can't they give you the whole show instead of about 20mins. Very disappointing. I feel like I wasted my money. It's not the show it's that there's not much of it. Dean Martin was so great this set is not. Shame.Just wanted to add it's really fun to watch. I didn't know you can go on YouTube and watch some segments there. Some of the shows are about 37mins long. If your a fan you might like this collection."
2,be aware...,"The Garrison dvds are better!!! More music with Dean and Ken at the piano, more intro songs with Dean, and just more Dean overall. I picked up the 1 dvd version of the Time Life set, after collecting the Garrison set, and was really shocked at how chopped up the ""episodes"" are...especially after the opening credits let you in on who was ""cut"" from the dvd version. A 17 min. version of a 50 min. program!?! NBC can and should do better than this offering."
2,Fair at best,"I agree with the writer that said this is fair at best. I was expecting to see the entire 50 minute show and instead I am watching a chopped up version of a show that ,as a kid, I was glued to for the whole hour when it was on tv. What would it have taken to put the whole show on this DVD...even if there were only ten, it would have definitely been better than missing all of the fun parts of this show....Again the consumer gets it! I am sure when word gets out, the sale of this item will be greatly deminished.....what could have been a super collection turns out to be just another dud"
3,Disapointed,"I Love Dean Martin. I remember his shows when I was a kid and I wanted to see them again,as I remembnered them. I thought this would be it. Its Not. These are not whole episodes just highlights from episodes. Thus the disapointment. None with Frank,those will probably be a separate set. Anyway just to let everybody know. These are not whole shows,be warned."
1,Save your money,"The Deam Martin Show ran for nine seasons for 264 episodes. What few there are in this set are shorts of just a handful of episodes which someone decided to edit and use.Wait for the full library.Get it only if you can't wait. If you remember the original show you'll be disappointed with this. (As I was - I had a good memory as a kid.) If you are viewing for the first time, you'll be missing alot."
4,Good basic treatise on marketing,Rob Adams delivers a fair amount of info about marketing for new high tech products. Most of what is said is very sound and based on practical experience.
1,Take a pass on this one,"This author is fairly arrogant for someone who can't write in complete sentences. Also, the principles espoused in the book can be found in any Business or Marketing 101 text book. And they don't contain near the amount of meglomania that this one does. Skip it."
1,SELF PROMOTING TRASH,"There are very few books that I can't finish. This, however, is one of them. I only wish I had purchased it here so that I could return it.I purchased the book after reading the forward and first chapter. The book is not for your everday entrepreneurs. For instance....one of the authors RULES is if your business isn't in a sector with a BILLION dollar market forget it. Now that's crazy considering how many self-made millionaires today started with a small storefront operation. The still aren't in a Billion dollar market and they are doing just fine.Skip this one unless you are opening a tech company and intend to compete with IBM, Microsoft, Sun, etc.The author talks about how companies should bring ""the least acceptable"" version of their product to market. I think he has followed his own advice on this one."
1,Snappy Title; Lousy Book,"The author seems to assume that all entrepreneurs are the best of life-long friends with venture capitalists and that they will just get the money when they ask. Wrong. If you don't have these strong personal connections with money sources, this book is a waste of time."
1,Quite dissappointing,I was less than impressed by this book.It seems very unrealistic considering the environments start-ups must survive in. How can any start-up afford to take a full year or more to conduct market validation research before even commencing operations? This may sound wise in theory but not in practice. In the real world you usually need to make a gut level decision to pounce on an opportunity or not. Opportunities disappear very quickly and won't wait a year for you to do your homework first.
4,Required reading for anyone in the software business,"Whether you're in marketing, sales, engineering, finance, or customer support, whether you work for a startup, mid-size company, or an industry behemoth, if you're in the software business you need to read this book.In a few fast reading chapters, Rob has distilled the lessons learned from a handful of startups over many years into a winning playbook for the software entrepreneur or manager.Rob wrote this book with the entrepreneur in mind, but I think its lessons are just as valuable to large company managers as well."
1,2 for content; 1 for overall style,"The author's arrogant ""I'm the only one who knowsd this stuff!"" style made me want to retch."
1,Not very good,"This here book not veru good. I recomend instead Bruce A. Berman's fantastic book ""I got Here. You Can To"". This book has beeb climbing the Amazon rankings at a breath-taking rate of 500% per day. The Berman Differential is a Masters Course in Becoming a Millionaire."
1,This book can be trying to read,"Despite the author's claims to be the know-it-all guru of startups he has made some glaring errors in the book. Here's one example:""Take, for example, the misconception that venture investment substantially dilutes the founders' ownership of the company. In reality, the involvement of quality venture investors typically raises valuation in the long run.""Does the author really not understand that ownership and valuation are two separate and distinct things?Earth to Rob Adams: investment may increase a company's valuationbut it also most assuredly dilutes the founders' ownership. And dilution of ownership with the concomittant loss of control is a big concern for most entrepreneurs.Add to dumb mistakes like this the author's penchant for being a blow-hard self-promoter and you have a book that can be very challenging to finish.I gave up after the first half."
1,I did not enjoy this book,I like to think of myself as a person who reads a lot of business books. I am an entrepreneur as well and this book could NOT hold my attention. I ended up returning it to get my money back. I think it was because the things they were saying and talking about was not interesting at all. This is my first bad review of a business book. :(
1,Weak,"I read this book and stopped about halfway through. Why? Because I expected some insightful information for entrepreneurs to start businesses. All I got out of it was the idea that you need to pander to the desires of venture capitalists in order to get venture capital.There is little, if any information here for the independent entrepreneur. If you want to capture venture capital, then this is the book. It will put you in the mindset of the venture capitalist. However, if you are looking to start a business and are ambivalent about venture capital this is no the book for you.I suggest you use your money for marketing rather than buying this book, unless you are trying to get venture capital a la 1999."
1,Waste of time & money,"If you take brunch and sip tea with your local venture capitalists, then you won't need this book. However, if you don't have any strong personal connections with VCs this book will be even more useless to you."
4,A hard kick,"I read the Art of the Start and Then I read this one... I think that ""Art"" had more practical information and was a much more pleasant read. Although the concepts can be applied to many types of startups, It seems to concentrate on technology companies. Both books are very motivating, and very similar."
1,Simply awful...,"Poorly written...badly edited...sloppily organized...I struggled to continue and finally had to put the book down halfway through. Full of bad and contradictory advice that flies in the face of every established business principle. What a bunch of self-serving tripe. Totally irrelevant for about 99% of the population...unless you're some techno-geek with a half-baked idea and access to loads of money from equally out-of-touch VC people. By the way, how many of these HOT start-up companies that Adamas writes about have YOU ever heard of? What garbage."
1,Little More Than Self-Propmotion,"This book is nothing more than an advertisement for the author's incubator in Texas. Every story, example, and reference to a company involves one of his incubator portfolio companies. As well, after about the first fifty pages the constant bragging about his achievements became tedious. I also found his assumption that everyone reading the book had easy access to capital via their venture capital buddies very unrealistic."
3,A few gems among the lot,I've finished reading through the book. The epitaths seem for the most part to be fairly straight up in their messages.My favorite of the lot is:Here Liesin a horizontal position --THOMAS HINDEClock and Watch makerWho departed this life wound upin hope of being taken in handby his Maker and beingthoroughly cleaned repaired andset a-going in the world to comeOn the 15th of August 1863In the 19th year of his life
2,Not the item in picture + Junior sizded,I received a football that does not look like the one in this picture here. Apparently this has happened to other buyers as well. This is the only reason I could not give a average + rating.For 10 dollars though I was happy with my Junior Football
4,Kenya,"This is another good volume in the Globetrottter series. The size of the book and the nice map are big pluses. In the case of Kenya I could have hoped for a little more info about the restauants, hotels, etc. But, still the size, easy reading are going to make it into my suitcase."
1,WORSE THAN ONE STAR,"I am by no means a professional Egyptologist, yet I have beenfascinated by the pyramids thanks to history courses offered in myhigh school, back in the 70s, as well as Oriental Institute courses.This should not be on the market. There are better books out there with much better and more accurate information.This was written by a young adult, certainly not by the same author of ""Egyptian Cosmology"" or ""Exiled Egyptians."" This entire book is an insult to Pyramidology and Egyptology."
4,Remember Guy Pierce?,"Yeah he's in this one. Kind of a horror, black comedy as a recall. It has to do with cannibalism and the Donnor Party and some kind of Native American legend. Worth a watch."
3,"Good speakers, but no bass control","I bought these speakers for my mp3 player, as opposed to the traditional desk setup for a computer. While I was surprised at the power these little speakers had, I often found the bass overpowering the satellite speakers. Obviously, this was due to the fact that the subwoofer was on the ground along with the satellites, but this problem could have been remedied if there was a separate control knob for the bass.For a traditional desktop setup, I don't think you'll find this as problematic, but even so, the bass often felt way too strong."
5,"First of all, im older than 13 years old...","OK, all I wanted to say is that these speakers are amazing. I guess I dont have much to campare them to since the last speakers I had were these crappy ones that came with my computor, but still, this is an AWESOME system. I got it as a present from my sister, and after hearing how good they sound I was stunned to see that they are only twentysix dollars. They have a great sub-woofer that can almost get too loud sometimes, and they look good too. I know everyone is gonna say my review isn't helpful but all there is to say is that this is a great buy. Unless you want a friggin movie theater surround system that costs a thousand bucks, this will do the job....by the way they can get REALLY loud too. ;)"
5,Creative Labs Speakers,"Hello,Let me say that this is one of the best purchases I have made in my life. When i got to the computer store to purchase the system in-store, i did not know that there would be so few left. I had to look in a corner in the far upper shelf needing a cart to get to to actually find a remaining system.After I got the system, I was pleased that it was so nicely packaged and well protected in its case. I was not expecting the subwoofer to be so large.When i opened the package and actually used the system, I found the sound was truly fascinating and incredible. In the next door, my friends cup of water shook similar to that of Jurassic park with the intermittent beats of some good bass.This is truly heaven, thank you oh lord, and praise the heavens for this amazing piece of equipment.I have a complaint - the subwoofers may just rock TOO much as my feet experienced slight agitation!"
1,"severe, severe downgrade for this line","I have owned 6 sets of this style over the years, my whole family has used them. We took the larger set everywhere - to the hospital when my wife gave birth, on vacation, etc... and people always asked what they were due to the great sound. The last pair before these that we bought were the original version, the ""PC Works"" set. It was tiny, plastic, and EXCELLENT for its size.That's ALL over now. This set has terrible midrange response, tinny treble and muddy, thumpy, messy bass, at any volume.I've recommended these to many people, now I'm a little afraid that my most recent advice resulted in the purchase of these horrid little things - and that I'll never be trusted again..."
2,"Very Difficult, Too Linear","I loved Fallout. Once armed and with even leather armor you could strike out in any direction in search of adventure. There was a storyline, but it was still possible to get a job or gamble your way through for a good while, building up experience in the process. Fallout 2, on the other hand, is very difficult. Creatures are so tough at first that survival becomes a challenge unto itself. Guns or body armor would be helpful, but there are none to be found. The storyline, and character survival, are so intertwined that striking off in any direction, alone, is certain death. Experience points come very, very slowly. Crippling injuries are common. Because it's part of the Fallout genre I give it 2 stars, but it really deserves only one star."
2,There are similar games for the Mac that are much better.,"Its graphics and sound are lackluster. Its manual is overly long and poorly written. The gameplay is far from fun or enjoyable. I would have to guess that those who really liked this game have not played other truly good games on the Macintosh. There are plenty of other similar games for the Mac that are much better than this one. I got it on sale for only $4, yet consider it a regrettable waste of money."
1,dont buy unless your running an older mac os x version 10.5.2,this game dos not run properly on os x 10.5.3 or later. video drivers are messed up so unless u like playing in half a screen and can deal with what could best be described as really low resolution predator heat vision i would pass on this one. besides fallout 3 will be out in a few months
2,"Okay game, but bad graphics","If this game had been released for the Mac 2 - 3 years ago then I might be in a position to recommend it. I think the game is terribly dated in terms of looks and game play. As far as a RPG it is pretty good, there is lots of story and character development and the turn based attack system works well. However that doesn't make up for its shortcomings. My biggest complaints are the graphics and the interface. On my computer (G4 533 w/GeForce2 MX card) the graphics are very grainy and pixilated. This may not bother some people, but to me it made game play very unpleasant. The interface makes it hard to move your character and interact with the environment, such as picking up objects. I wanted to like this game because the original was a trendsetter, but I feel that this release is too dated given the quality of games available now."
5,I love it!,"I bought this for my husband's birthday. It is a lot of fun! A nice variation on cribbage when you are tired of cards & pegs. This will be enjoyed for a long time. but this is definately not a game for someone who is not familiar with cribbage scoring, best to learn cribbage WELL first or this will be totally overwhelming."
4,Challenging Cribbage,This game is great for people who like Math. It is quite the challenge to make the cards all add up. Keeps one's mind really going.
5,Another 5 stars,"I liked the group setting. Money well spent. This is a treasure, helped me a lot. Enjoyed reading the reviews."
5,ALL HAMHAMS HERE,"I got this for christmas in 2002 from my cousin, I love bijou!! she is my #1 fave hamham along with CAPPY PENELOPE SANDY HAMTARO OXNARD & PASHMINA!!! Im all those charicters #1fan and im a 9 year old girl and I can write a-lot of things right!"
4,Good...BUT...,"If I could have asked maestro Sinopoli one musical question, it would have been: why did you decide to direct such a different version of the Eighth...? His earlier version, done in the eighties ( also on DG) is so much more powerful...emotional...dark with brief moments of light. This newer one is smaller, lighter and I don't think what Schubert would have appreciated...get the earlier version (coupled with a great Mendelssohn fourth). I liked the Ninth a little more, but for newer versions try the Abbado...for older...maybe Krips."
4,Good memories,"Like most boomer males I saw this one in the early 60s and loved it. Of course it has aged (like we have) and nothing like this is as great when your 50 as when your 10, but it brings back some fond old memories that allow you to escape to a simpler and in many ways a better time than now, if only for an hour or so. For that its well worth owning and watching."
5,A very original and creative look at group development,"This was a real eye-opener for me. It forever changed this way I look at group development. The author's use of chaos theory was well reasoned and the ample examples made it very understandable. I love the chapter on the spiritual aspects of groups. One of the strongest parts of the book were the chapters on leading groups. The chapter on how groups change and grow was also exceptional. After reading this book much of my intuition about how groups develop, grow, and change was confirmed. I wish I had read this book in graduate school."
1,Cheaply made,"Cheap plastic material. The ""hands"" and feet are glued on: the packing box was ok but one foot already dettached from the body even b4 I open the box, as I can tell that the hands and another foot will eventually come off (not the shipping problem). Returned."
5,Understandable at Last,"This book makes a complex Buddhist belief understandable for most. The author illustrates principals with examples from his own life. Interspersed with poetry and songs, it is an insightful study on a most important subject."
5,NO WORRIES,"A very good and MUCH NEEDED book. It really does what it says on the tin. It changes you for the better. Not by casting outside ideas or rituals inside of you, but by awakening YOUR OWN primordial self goodness, or buddhahood, which really has been, and is with you at all times.Some people (westerners) may find concern or trouble that this book is in a Buddhist or Tibetan context. NO WORRIES. The book and author are not there to 'recruit' anyone onto nothing. It is a revealing book about primordial human commom attitudes, feelings, hopes and fears, and the very much common human death that ALL follow. A WIN WIN situation if you read it and give it a deep thought or a chance to what you just read. Specially when you have the feeling that there must be something more to life than what is perceived in our pragmatic and materialistic west. Best of luck"
5,Great book!,"I bought this book because there is a lot of death of friends and family in my life. Also quite a bit of sickness. It has helped me talk to my family better about death and dying as well as the quality of life and what you have, not what you wish you had. Great book for anyone interested in the wonder of living and dying."
5,Everyone that has any chronical disease should read this truly healing book.,"I began to read this book to learn more about the Spiritual aspect. I intended to be reading something just educational, however, this book goes far beyond teaching one's mind. The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying opens the heart. I am waiting for an organ transplant of which I know if I don't receive my time here on this earth is a lot shorter than I would have liked it to be. After reading this book, I not only have been educated but have found many peaceful lessons of which I have shared with others. I highly recommend this book to anyone."
5,"Life, Death, Chaos, and Reincarnation","As a noted Zen master once said, when dying:""This is all, and nothing more.""I think that sums up the beauty of this book."
2,I did my best.,"I really tried hard to finish this book but after over 200 pages of flowery words, I figured that I am not cut out for this religion. My mistake is that I expected to find some universal enlightenment without religious conversion."
4,The owners manuel to life.,"Why do we do the things we do? This book will open your eyes to the wastefulness of our every day lives and how we waste precious energy on desire's and useless needs. Our ""Active Laziness"" as Rinpoche calls it drains us from what we should really be doing, thinking, and feeling. If you ever read ""Tuesdays with Morrie"" you will see this kind of thinking. Rinpoche will explain how and why every breath you take and every step you take should be chrerished as if it was your last, but not in a morbid way, but instead in a positve way.Read this book to better your self in every way."
5,The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying,The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying: The Spiritual Classic & International Bestseller; Revised and Updated EditionThe Tibetan Book of Living and Dying is a Spiritual Classic and should be essential reading by everyone. I would even recommend it be on the school curriculum and be read by all school children.
4,Beautiful book,This is a beautiful book for those of us seeking more enlightenment. You really have to read to to understand what perspective he is trying to give on life.
2,The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying: The Spiritual Classic & International Bestseller; Revised and Updated Edition,I found this book difficult to read and understand. There are so many footnotes and other distractions that I was unable to remain focused on the central theme. Its value to me is off the scale to the left.
1,Aesthetic ridges?,"Am I the only person who received this book with ridges (like dents?) on the side of the pages? I haven't read this book yet, but for some reason this condition of the book bothers me since I got it new from Amazon. Is this simply how the style of the pages should be?"
5,Fantastic,"It is great book, loving it. good condition and good postage time. Extremely happy with it"
3,Beyond an ordinary person's comprehension,"I love reading spiritual and psychological books and do think a lot while and after reading them. I must admit that I didn't finish the The Tibetan Book. I found that it might be beyond my comprehension(as an average and ordinary person but who does actively seek spiritual well-being) as I think that many concepts, although I agree with, are too abstruct. They are something that you feel heartedly agree with, but forget all about the next moment that you put down the book.I guess that I have to enhance my spiritual comprehension more to truely appreciate (and finish reading) the book. However, I believe that I will get back to it later - in years' time."
3,Insightful but over the top,"... The authors compassion and wisdom shine through, however I started to find the outlandish claims of the reincarnation process to become tiresome. Essentially the better half of the book is the beginning which is concerned with ""living"". Here the author provides concrete insights into the nature of our human existence and advice for leading a ""good"" life. The second half which is concerned with ""dying"" and its process, really started to become barely tolerable with all the ritualistic and mythical nonsense. It is all presented as if it is fact and beyond dispute, and that you are close minded if you dont just accept it as truth. I'm sorry, I need some real scientific evidence beyond the authors stories and anecdotes if I'm going to believe these claims. More insight and less ""religion"" would have been better."
5,"Insightful, Inspiring, and Enlightening","This is one of the few books I would say everyone should have and eventually read, especially if you have someone in the family that is getting older or soon to pass away. The thoughts about life have helped me become more and live more now."
5,A true jewel,"This is the best book that I have ever read. It is the essence of compassion and because of it's masterful writing and the precious lessons in the book, I am a happy, content person. I cannot stress how valuable this work is and how much everyone owes it to themselves to pick up a copy as soon as possible. It will change your life if you let it. Thank you so much, Rinpoche! Metta, Robert F. O'Bryan"
4,Adorable,"My daughter has become quite a little animal fanatic. In her preschool they learned about all kinds of creatures, and she decided that beavers were herfavorite. I must say, it wasn't easy to find little play beavers. These guys are very cute and they were perfect."
5,These work great in an UGF setup,These airstone's are great because they are cheap and work well.But they only come with one connector so you should by two bags if you need to run two air stone's at once like me.But other than that these are great
4,Courage Under Fire,"Well acted, tight battle scenes. For the military buff,along with Three Kings, this movies is one of the few opportunities to see the military in action in the Persian Gulf. Much better battle action here than in Three Kings.The movie picks up momentum as it presents the perspectives of the survivors.Watch for an early Matt Damon as a post battle druggie torn by guilt.As usual, Denzel Washington is excellent and Meg Ryan was unexpectedly believable as the unit commander under fire. Who would have thought that she could play tough?All in all, an enjoyable movie."
2,"Poor movie, but fabulous DVD","Director Edward Zwick choiced a Rashomon like film narration to make the first Hollywood movie related to the Gulf war. Alas, Zwick isn't Kurosawa, furthermore the script is mediocre, phony and - overall - lacks courage.Denzel Washington plays poorly a poor character - ergo not even a great actor can save an unsound script.Meg Ryan - BTW coproducing the movie - is simply ridiculous, I understand she's bored to be America's sweetheart, but she'll never be plausible as playing a soldier?!However this DVD edition will be a joy for your eyes and - mainly - ears. The DTS audio track is one of the most powerful and well defined I've ever heard. If you are interested to put to the test your home theater then this DVD is a great choice."
2,Very very good--timeless!,"This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. With an award-winning cast, Courage Under Fire is the story of one crash, one captain (Meg Ryan as ""Karen Walden""), one crew, and one man (Denzel Washington as ""Nat Serling"") sent to investigate it all as a process of his own redemption. Thinking the search is an easy, open-and-shut case, he is ordered to detirmine whether Captain Walden is worthy of the Medal of Honor. But he finds many complications--all too familiar, and similar to his own past mistakes in Desert Storm. Eventually, a questionable story is untangled, the truth is known, and a medal won."
4,Speedy deliveriy,"CD was recieved sooner than expected, product was in good condition as described. Was packaged well."
1,Hollywood PC B$,"Melodramatic Brady Bunch plot goes big screen.Picture Meg Ryan as a combat helicopter pilot in Desert Storm (no really!)and because she's female,the men of whom she outranks don't think she's as good as them in a war situation.So she ends up butting heads with a macho Latino soldier because she's a women.What we have is the Hollywood PC machine trying desperately to dramatize a girls vs boys theme set in a war zone.Another GI Jane movie that nobody wanted to see,but was produced anyway.Almost seems as if Hollywood was trying to produce a date movie that guys and gals would want to see together,but instead just wasted time,talent and money on.No wonder studios go broke when producing stupidity like this.But then again,Aaron Spelling has made tons of money off of the stupidity of the American public over the years using just such plot devices."
3,Courage Under Fire Review,"It was pretty good, but it did have a great deal of swearing in it. It did a good job about of giving people a glimpse of what happened in the Persian Gulf War."
4,Good movie,I enjoyed this movie very much. Denzel is an all-out terrific actor. He can play so many kinds of roles and this is one of his best.
5,"Exciting, thoughtful, and inspiring","Most movies are one or the other, but Courage Under Fire sliced through the knot of the problem revealing deep troubles among the soldiers and in the politics of awarding medals to deserving soldiers. Denzel Washington played a strong man who persisted in searching for the truth in the face of opposition. The movie grabbed me, held my attention, startled my sensitivity, and provided resolution. A rare movie that meets all my criteria for excellence."

5,100% Harry Fan,I loved this CD. Harry is one of my favorite musicians and I thought this CD was one of his best. An amazing collection from an amazing performer. I would recomend it to anyone who likes to hear good quality music.
1,organic crap,"i gave 1 star only out of respect for their effort to produce organic products. (supporting the healthy environment)but other than that, it's waste of money.it says absolutely plastic free- yes, it is true. it's a piece of organic toilet paper with sticker on the back.it disolves with my sweat or discharge or whatever it is supposed to be for, and makes a big mess.on top of that, the pulp from it got stuck on my skin and gave me a rash.when i went to see a doctor, she said; ""throw that organic crap""i just have to avoid sweating (in the summer!) or change it every 30 minutes or every hour.i still have a whole box of this product, and thinking about how to get rid of it as soon as possible.there are some other organic products, so i'd advise people to choose one of those, but absolutely not this one."
2,Not worth it,"I definitely do not recommend these liners to anyone. Trying to live a greener lifestyle, I picked these up at the local grocers since they were on sale. I was surprised when I opened the box. These liners are small. They do not stick well to your underwear and they tear easily. I think I will be sticking to Carefree until their is a better greener pantyliner out on the market."
2,No so great!,"I tried a box of these 5 years ago and they ended up sitting in my cabinet as back up because they don't hold up well. I decided to give these another try recently, and they still don't hold up. I was hoping they would make better quality after all this time, but these things fall apart in less than half a day and get wedged in uncomfortable ways! I would have to use 3 a day and given the expense and waste of doing that makes this product low quality."
3,ESPERABA MAS.,"La verdad que esta grabación en vivo de la quinta Sinfonía de Mahler por Abbado con la Filarmónica de Berlín, es hasta cierto punto decepcionante, todo suena más no llega esta versión a explotar toda la maravilla de esta Sinfonía.Mejores versiones son: Solti/Chicago, Boulez/Vienna, Levine/Filadelfia."
4,The many talents of Graeme Revell,"I wouldn't call anything Graeme Revell composed a masterpiece, but I will declare that each and every one of his efforts at film scoring is another piece of an ever growing puzzle that does nothing less but excite the listener and give them another perspective of film music....""Below"" is one more piece that deserves specific merit. This is a tantalizing composition that includes action, sorrow, suspense and, in a highly effective use of strings and horns, an elegiac cue that describes perfectly the cathartic demise of the submarine in the film...A truly worthy score, and a must-have for Revell fans..."
4,Nice surprise,"This oil provides a lovely, very different flavor from other nut oils. It was a nice surprise when my husband prepared me a lunch salad with it. I found it strong and lively. However, as it is expensive, we might not be able to have it around for everyday use. Thank you for providing a figurative trip to the exotic since we cannot afford to travel to Morocco!"
5,Just about the Finest Band around !!!!!!!!!!,"Having just had the priviledge of seeing DM severaltimes recently during their annual UK tour,they arewithout a doubt the freshest and most innovative bandaround.It's fun all the way from the wonderful twin slideguitars of Tom Gray and Mark Johnstone to the incrediblevocal range of Kristine Markiton,not forgetting the engineroom of the band powered by Scott Callison and Phil Skipper.Tom Gray has described their music as Deltabilly Blues butthat does not really do justice to the amazing musical hybridthey have created.Do yourself a favour and seek this CD out asap.You won't bedisappointed."
1,A complete waste of money,"This is the most worthless map I have ever seen. I think these people were too concerned with the artistic aspect, and they failed to create something useful. And as a guide book? HA! A couple of sentences about a few select sights does not make a guidebook. If you want something pretty to look at while at home, then this would probably be fine. But don't bother taking it to Bermuda with you."
3,overrated,"It is boring and predictable and some (fotunately not all) actions by all persons involved look either unmotivated or way too stupid. Also, there are some clear editorial oversights.On the plus side, there is a feeling that the author does have some real life experience in these matters - in my view the 'boring' attribute comes out of this."
3,Prose like an Anchor,"There is a good story inside the pages of Triple Identity, but you have to read a lot of extra material to find the narrative thrust. The main character is a good one with a background in the Mossad and the USA Department of Justice. Unfortunately, and it might be due to the translation from the original Hebrew, the narrative is a muddy thing that deadens pace and action scenes alike. It took a lot of effort to keep reading, but there is enough here to make it worthwhile. I can't say I'll even pick up another Dan Gordon thriller however."
2,Where is the action?,"While this story had much potential, the pace of the book was EXTREMELY slow in many spots. Page after page of ""meeting-like"" dialogue going over background in excruciating detail bogs this ""thriller"" down. If you are interested in sitting through ""secret agent"" meetings, lunches, etc. and being in on every single aspect of their discussion, then you will be very pleased with the content and pace of this story. However, if your taste is higher on the action scale, and if you are bored by going through every move that someone makes or contemplates and why they did this and why they did that and why they didn't do this, and what they were thinking when they did ""that"", you might find this book a bit slow moving for you.I quit after getting through more than half the book waiting for someone to actually DO something. I assume the last part of the book picked up on action a bit, but I had already invested enough time in this ""thriller"" with very little entertainment value."
2,"Well played, but lacking personality.","The orchestral playing is excellent, and the sonics are fine, but these works, particularly the Czech Suite, need to have more swagger and soul. These performances sound like dutiful run-throughs compared to other, more idiomatic recordings, particularly those by the Czech Philharmonic."
5,Anand Shankar - The Fusion Genius,"There is so much to write about this great sitarist/instrumentalist, but all of a sudden i can't find much to write now! Anand Shankar was probably one of the 'pionners' of what many address it as 'fusion' music! He had a head start on this fusion role wayyyyyyy b4 some other were familiar with this term. I hear so many people going nuts over Ravi Shankar, but i don't think Ravi's mucic is as melodious as Ananda's were!!! Ravi is more widely known; where as, Ananda kept a very low profile. Ananda produced less but Quality cuts. Such a great blend of sitar, guitar, drum, tabla...aah list goes on. Another word, if you are looking for an instrumental cd, i don't think there are too many of this kind! I bought every single cd with his name on it and i'm still looking for more (knowing there aren't any new ones). If you have good ear for the music, i can't see how you can be disappointe by this master piece!!!"
3,Were 2 mo's expired,Were ordered on 9-27-09 and the date on the package said do not sell after 7-10-09.
1,450 Calories per Oz -- not healthy,"Stay away from this product if you want to control your calorie intake, by taking supposedly healthier dried vegetable chips. Found the nutrition fact -- 450 calories per oz. It triples what you would find in other dried veggie chips."
3,Taste good but do not comply with my diet,"I'm counting carbs, and I ordered these hoping they would provide an alternative for me to high-carbohydrate snacks. The similar veggie chips I have bought in the grocery store list 2 grams of carbs; this product lists 18g; fiber - only 2g -- that's 16 net carbs, way too many allowed on my diet. It would be helpful to have the nutrition facts presented on the product page before purchase (or if it is there - I missed it). Sugar is not listed as an ingredient so I am not sure why these are so high in carbs as the similar product with 2grams lists the same ingredients: sweet potato, squash, carrot, green bean, and taro. The other figures are not bad: calories: 130, fat calories, 50, total fat: 6g; saturated fat: 0g; trans fat: 0g. Although on my low carb diet, I don't have to worry so much about calories and fat. Hope this review is helpful to you."
5,Hooked On Anne Rice,"I had heard of Anne's vampire books, but wasn't really interested. When I saw she had gone into Witchery, with a novel based in my two favorite cities, I knew I would like it. I bought it when it was first released, years ago, and it is still my favorite of all her books. I don't usually keep fictions, since I move alot, but this one always goes with me. Highly recommended."
2,Seems cheap,"I bought this after using Wyler's Low Sodium cubes. I figured it wouldn't be that much different, but it was. When it dissolved in the hot water (which it did dissolve quicker than Wylers) it didn't integrate with the water fully. It seemed to have a layer of fat on the top. Tasted fine in my dish, but I was very disappointed in the consistency of it. I'm spending the extra bit and buying the other."
1,Flavorless,Buy the McCormic wet soup bases instead and keep them in the fridge. The first ingredient should be the meat you want the flavor of. If it isn't you will get salt water without flavor like this product.
1,Fan Noise,"Fan noise is killing me on this laptop. Its amazing. It can be heard upto several feet away even when there is surrounding noise. Not to mention other issues like weight, _very_ low battery life (its much lower than they advertise). The only thing that stands out in this laptop is its screen. I also have intermittent problems with the touchpad. Overall, I wouldnt recommend this laptop at all. I want to reach out to Sony and get it exchanged if possible, even if I have to pay some money. The fan noise is very erratic also - goes up and down like nobody's business. I am also not happy with the performance of this laptop - not sure its windows or the hardware tho. Looks to me, its hardware since windows has less latency issues on my other desktop."
2,Heavy power consumption,"I have been very disappointed with this computer. It is supposed to be portable but the battery life is so poor that you have to be near mains power. I find that I get just over half an hour from the battery before it needs recharging. I cannot watch a DVD film on it using battery power. The power requirement is so high that I cannot find an Air/Car 12v adapter powerful enough to charge the battery. This machine is a step backwards not a step forwards.I contacted Sony and I didnt find their advice useful. They could only suggest the things I had already tried through ""Help"" etc. From this experience I would not buy a Sony again."
2,Poor quality and a great disappointment,"The Pentium 4 CPU requires that the fan run all the time at a very fast speed which means that it is VERY noisy. I looked at this very model in several stores and NEVER heard the fan run. I was told by Sony that the fan was not on in the store because it wss bssically being used as a ""TV"" not a computer. I feel that this is false advertising. I did extensive research on this unit before purchasing. Now I am facing up to a $400.00 penalty when I return this unit to have the seller take it back (if they will). This is bad business and bad retail policy on the part of Amazon. Buyer beware!"
3,An Average Laptop At Best,"Although it does have some good points, like a very nice display, and USB ports EZ access, there are some serious faults with this machine. As everyone has pointed out, the battery life is practically nil, the fan is noisy, and to top it off, in the last year and 1/2, I've had to replace the battery and the hard disc. Thanks to the Best Buy extended warranty, this hasn't been a financial burden. The warranty has paid for itself. But, it is extremely burdensome and I am wondering what's going to fail next. It is not your best option to buy this machine, even though it is an adequate desktop replacement."
5,Sin of Omission,"I was fortunate to receive a pre-release copy of ""Sin of Omission"". It immediately pulled me back to a familiar time, and to a world that at first blush, seemed simple and straight forward. But page by page, the Author peeled back the outer layers of that world, revealing its bevelled edges and haunting shadows.""Sin of Omission"" is not quite a coming of age story, not quite a mystery, not quite an historical period piece. Perhaps in its masterful weave, we have witnessed the birth of a new American genre.It is impossible to believe this is the Author's first published novel. I hope more will follow."
2,A Wall Street Scam explained...,"I bought this for research into an expose I was writing on the greatest Ponzi scheme ever; it's called the Stock Market. However, many parts of what I've researched and written have before and since been portrayed in film. - Now likely, once the public understands the monumental fraud of Wall Street, it will be too late for me to write anything because no one will have any money to buy my book. Oh well. :-)"
4,"Entertaining and still relevant, after all these years","The book tells the story of a very succesfull stock speculator, and not least how he became successful by learning from his own mistakes and lack of insight. The book is very well written and the stories excitingly told. It also gives a flair of the financial world at the beginning of the 20th century. Although the tools and terms of today's stock market are lightyears from the scenes portraid, the psychology of the mind, market and the basics of fear and greed are the same. Anyone active in the market, professional and amateur will benefit from reading this book. Not least the account of how the main character of the book developed insight into himself is priceless."
5,Reminiscences of a Stock Operator,Many reviews have been written about this book. All that I have seen are accurate. It is a superb book and a riveting read. The author gives you a good look at the thinking of a momentum operator as well as a view of financial history.The view of the bucket shops of old provides and insight that could be loosely applied to todays currency brokers and the pools to those of the hedge funds.
5,investors will love this book,"I didn't exactly learn much from this book, but it was still an enjoyable read, watching a trader's life. Jesse Livermore's career (this is his fictional biography) had lots of ups and downs, and it's fascinating to learn about them."
5,Reminiscences of a stock operator,This is a very good book for a beginner stock trader; it gives you an inside into the world of trading. Easy to follow and very enjoyable.
2,Little practical value,This book has some historical value. But if you are looking to learn how be a trader than I doubt this book will help you.Livermore made millions but still found himself broke in the end. He died poor and commited suicide. His psychology is more that of a gambler than a trader.And many of the tactics that made him millions are either impossible today or forbidden.I enjoyed to learn about the life of this man but the book has little practical value.
5,A must read for any investors!!!,"This book is probably one of be best investment book ever written. I am a senior majoring in finance at NSU and have been investing for around 4 yrs now. I've made plenty of investing mistake in my short career, but was lucky enough to learn from them and didn't get caught in this bear market (got out around nasdaq 4200). Even though this book was written over 80 years ago, what was true yester-years is still true today and futures to come. So I highly recommend anyone who's interested in investing to read this book and believe you will walk aways gaining something."
4,Interesting stories about the stock market in the early 1900s,"This is a classic book about Livermore, created from a series of newpaper articles back in the 1900s. It's fairly interesting reading, and has a gritty writing style using language of the day about traders 'putting out a line' on a stock 'from their boodle', etc. There are also some interesting lessons about trading that the author (Lefevre) draws out from Livermore's experiences.This would be a reasonable biography read, even if it didn't have so many financial trading stories and lessons. The Kindle version is especially cheap (0.99), although it has quite a few minor quality issues caused (I think) by OCR scanning mistranslations, as well as some missing words at the beginning of sentences, and some odd chunks of whitespace and other formatting issues.I would recommend it to anyone interested in trading, or in the stock market environment of the time."
2,Stories,This book reads more like a story.I purchased the book with the objective to improve my knowledge on stock trading. And this book did not achieved the effect that I wanted.Pros:It reads more like a storybook with interesting plots.Cons:I did not get any fruitful knowledge. Considering it is widely accepted as an investment book. Perhaps my level of understanding is poor. Will be great if someone can advise me on how to interpret or use this book correctly.I can wholly appreciate Intelligent Investor but not this.
3,A great view of the psychology of the stock trader,"What eminates throughout this book is the following:1. The stock market is a complicated machine that takes a lot of understanding to truly understand.2. Always consider the overall market conditions because human psychology plays a large role in how people move money in and out of the stock market.3. The author focuses a lot on commodities so keep in mind that this is the most volotile beat within the stock market system.4. The author's writing style can be a bit repetitive so be mindful of this while reading it.5. You'll get an idea of just how much ""insider"" trading really goes on in the world.Worth the read."
3,"A classic yes, but how much of it still applies?","I've read my share of stock trading books. Most of them say speculating is a bad idea, and that no one can predict the market. Index fund, diversification... are our best bet.This book, from the very first page tells us the market can be predicted and the protagonist made tons of money by spotting trends.Some say trading hasn't changed, principles from this 90 year old book still apply today. I seriously doubt it. Today more than 50% of the trade is made by high frequency trading, super computers steal money from the slow traders before the latter know it. Predict that!"
5,Reimiscences,"Great insight into the human condition, particularly from the perspective of operating in the financial markets. I highly recommend it."
4,Entertaining,"It is amazing that with all the advancement in technology during this era, the basics of trading remain the same: fear and greed, supply and demand. I found this book enlightening in that it sheds light to human behavior and psychology of trading. If you're looking to find a mechanical system that tells you when and what to buy, go elsewhere. This book though, is a must read for anyone who wants to start trading stocks. I enjoyed it a lot."
5,Interesting book.,"Very entertaining to see that most things in the stock market have not changed the last hundred years. Not exactly a literary masterpiece, but plenty of good advice here and there. You can probably survive without, but defintely a beneficial read for people interested in the market."
5,Well Worth It,"An excellent read on the psychology of trading. Not many books on trading would be considered ""page turners"", but this one is. For the novice or professional trader, well worth it."
3,Didn't think it was that good,"Maybe I'm missing something. The conventional wisdom is that this is one of the classics.If you are a long term investor then there are other better books out there, such as ""A Random Walk down Wall Street"", or ""John Bogle: The first 50 Years"".Unless you are a trader of individual stocks or are interested in the psychology of a trader I just don't see the relevance of this book."
5,Classic but stilll timely,"Great read covering the psycological aspects of trading(Winning, Losing, and learning from one's mistakes.)"
2,A gambling classic,"I found nothing new in this book that I could use as an investor. The book's author traded based on what is now called ""technical analysis"" or more precisely gambling. This is affirmed by the fact that this supposedly genius-trader ended his life with $10,000 to his name. Not good.The book is also not an easy read. May be it was back then when it was written, but it was hard going for me. Had to drop it 2/3 way down. Of course, may be the last third was the best, where all that trading wisdom and writing skills came out, but I just could not handle it any more."
2,Good historical stories but....,"If you're looking for some historical stories, thats the book. Keep in mind the author is not a trader so we see many things like... ""I have a friend who..."" or ""I met a guy that...""There is way to much hype on this book. Not a bad book but don't be too anxious to read it... you might be disapointed."
4,"A must read, that's all there is to it.","This book has been positively reviewed like a 1000 times and here's my contribution. I've read it a 2nd time now (train literature) and notice how my current trading system is actually based on Larry's trading principles. Although I knew ""a stock is never too high to buy and too low to sell"", it's always nice to get that confirmation.Just read, don't expect to learn TA or anything, but pure mental strength in your trading/investing."
4,a relatable and fun read,"This was a fun biography that had me rooting for Livingston (Livermore) the whole time. Some of the more technical lessons of the market may not be as applicable, especially those about stock manipulation which most of us will never be involved with. However, the detailed observations of a successful trader's education makes it very relatable for most investors and traders. Most of today's great traders have read this text and speak foundly of it. Since this is a classic and not an expensive or overly long read, I don't know why any trader would omit this text from their library."
5,Finally not loosing money,Seems like we all have similar histories. Talking about us that risk our own money. Livermore knew that market action is the only thing that counts. Forget about the rest. Finally I am making money.
4,Interesting historical perspective,"Although first published in 1923 I found it very interesting that traders of that era were faced with pretty much the same challenges that face traders today. He emphasizes doing your homework, don't listen to ""inside tips"", Don't follow the crowd, and to make big money you need to bet big. Interesting stuff, but pretty standard fare for anyone already well versed in the financial markets."
5,Excellent Overview of Experiences,"This book deserves to be on your shelf. I have read it multiple times, and discusses, in a story format, the life of a trader and how he thinks, acts, and spent his time working the markets for his career.It is not detailed in the sense that you are going to come away with a clear idea of now how a beginning trader can be successful in the market trading, but you will come away with a psychology and feeling for what it is going to take to make it.An excellent resource for your tool chest of trading books. Highly recommended."
4,A very good book on the markets if you have some experience.,"Reminiscences was a very interesting book and a nice change from more technical or even psychologically oriented ones. I would never recommend it as the first book on trading you should grab, however. Much of the insight would be lost on you unless you had at least given some blood to the markets. One thing that makes the book so great is that the reader gets to see examples of why the old trading maxims are what they are by the way they in which they are used."
5,An investment primer for every age.,Mr. LeFevre's memoir is a primer for every age whether you are an investor or perhaps more importantly if you are considering working in the investment field.
4,No Complaints,The book was in good condition when I received it. It came soon after I ordered it. No complaints.
3,"An OK book, if you don't mind reading about the early market","I read this book a few years ago, and didn't really find it to be any kind of revelation to trading in general. It is mostly a fun read, with anecdotal references to the early times of trading (i.e., reading the literal ticker-tape, bucket shops, reading chalk boards, etc.). It definately helped me to appreciate that the trading opportunities today for confessed day-traders is even more numerous if you have a trading strategy. This book will not reveal any specific trading strategies that you can take to the bank, but it is a nice book for your library."
3,Not what it is hyped up to be.,"Before purchasing this book it was hyped pretty high. I though it would have more sound investing information rather than just a semi-fictional story about one man and his investing life. If you are not a champion of speculating then this book will not be that valuable to you. Bottom line I don't like to read fiction and this book is fiction. I don't care about people's nonsense ideas about the market and this is just one ""fictional"" persons account. I did find it interesting gleaming some historic knowledge on places and people. I would recommend reading this book if you get it for free or very cheap but don't buy it if there are other books you want to read. I think the people who love this book are more into fiction than I am and maybe feel they ""should"" love this book because other people do. I found freakanomics to be more interesting than this book. If you want to read a book about investing then read Intelligent Investor."
5,A must read for the professional trader. A Classic.,"The story of a early Twentieth century stock trader who ammassed a fortune and lost it several times over. It is a fascinating, exciting look into the world of a man who made his living trading stocks and commodities.The message: The more things change, the more they stay the same."
2,"Long read, little knowledge gain...","My former review on this book was not very positive: a very low ""useful knowledge"" per pages ratio. At the time I was trading on the side, like most people do. Now, after 1.5 years of readings (about 25 Amazon-bought books) and reflexions I'm trading full time; and doing well, by the way. I'dd say any real trader will recognize himself in Mr. Lefevre's story and any novice will extract some useful info. But if you're looking, like I was then, for something packed with substance on how to stock trade properly, keep shopping. This book is too long for what it has to say. It's a trader's BIOGRAPHY."
2,Websters millennium 2003 birding collection,had expectations of pictures with sound and habits of birds
1,Huh? Ok This is entertainment?,This show simply blows. Ok... A bunch of over sized brightly animated figures staring at each is... is well just dumb. Nuff said.. Have a nice life.
1,"""The Blues Bandits Is More Like It""","""The Climax Chicago Blues Band""? ""The Blues Bandits"" is more like it.They've stolen some good songs and run them into the ground. This bandhas about as much to do with the blues as the Blues Magoos & Blues Image.You couldn't hunt down a more cheesey, amatuerish sounding recording with a bloodhound. To compare this band to any era Fleetwood Mac is ridiculousand for them to add ""Chicago"" to the title of the band was a travesty.Otis Rush & Howlin' Wolf should have hunted these guys down and giventhem a good clocking. These fellows could in no way match up with the likes of true young white bluesmen like Paul Butterfield, Charlie Musselwhite, Danny Kalb, Michael Bloomfield, or Peter Green. Save yourmoney and buy some true Chicago blues, there's plenty of it out there."
3,nail polish,"The polish takes two coats to cover, but stays on well. The biggest problem is that the color was off from the original one I bought at the store. That was very disappointing since it was the color that prompted me to order it when it was no longer available in stores. The color is too brown now, which I don't like. Therefore, I don't want to wear it. I consider it money wasted."
1,"If you already own Jackson, Griffiths, and Barut, don't bother","Difficult to understand, very few examples, and the problems aren't very good at telling you what they are asking for. Maybe good if you already have a decent understanding of E&M, but this is not an appropriate text for a first graduate level class. Use Jackson for most stuff, fill in the gaps of what you missed as an undergraduate with Griffiths, and use Barut for the field theory stuff."
1,that's not a book,"Data On Wap, actually that's not a book. it's a kind of brochure. the book is 88 page which is badly printed. the first 10 page is an index, the last 5 pages is empty, 6 intermediate pages is a reference to web sites, another 6 intermediate pages is the contact address of the companies working in this field. about 15 pages with not more than 5 lines in the page. you can get the information found on this book from web sites. take my advise and don't try to buy this book."
2,"Reasonable overview, but too expensive","The Dec 1999 (issue 1.1) edition of this book is not as bad as the Aug edition; if you are buying this book, make sure you get the later one.The book is now a well-written and reasonably accurate overview of the WAP standards and the major players in this space, and I would have given it a higher rating if it weren't for the price."
1,doesn't work with windows 7,"I had so hoped this would work with Windows 7, but it doesn't. Don't buy it unless you have a dinosaur of a computer still around. Sad, because my son loved this game and wanted to play it again."
2,Tried to do too much.,"The idea of presenting the life of a Beijing taxi driver has great potential for some really interesting stories. Although there were some interesting moments and connections between the driver and his customers, they were not well developed. Instead the movie jumped around so much that those connections never evolved in a way that made sense. The acting was surprisingly good in spite of the struggling story."
1,Don't waste your money,"I wish someone had warned me about this DVD system. Unless you are an absolute beginer, then you are going to be very frustrated at the slow pace of the lessons. Starting with all the Quater note variations against the typical ride cymbal beat & then progressing from there. Not much syncopation which is what you would expect from a jazz learning system. I think you would be better off getting Jim Chapins book Advanced Techniques For The Modern Drummer: Coordinating Independence As Applied To Jazz And Be-bop With Cd (audio Vol. 1)Jim Chapin.

5,excellent,Una mujer como yo is the best mix yet from this fabulous Cuban writer-performer. The cuts are sensual and upbeat--Albita at her best. This CDshows that Albita is just as comfortable and magnificent in genres beyond the guajira and the son montuno. We want more!
1,Attention buyers: it is not a book but a notebook!,"I was a bit puzzled not to see any author; the item being called a ""book"", and having a ""review"" that spoke of how they used to make illuminated manuscripts, I ordered this ""Divine Comedy: The Illuminated Manuscripts"" by ""Dante"", to get a real shock: it turned out to be a plain notebook, or blank book if you prefer.The only thing related to the ""title"" was the pasted on the front cover illustration of a page of a famous manuscript; the manufacturer is ""Hartley & Marks Publishers Inc."" and states on the label on the back cover that ""This edition of Dante's masterpiece was illuminated in 1481 by Niccolò di Lorenzo"". ""Edition"", no mistake. All the (scant) information given by the publisher and by Amazon as well, is, to put it mildly, misleading.It couldn't happen in the stationary shop but expect it when you buy online. Strongly protested. Photos on demand."
4,Another great one,I always enjoy reading Charlie Shedd books. He is so down to earth and tells it like it is. Very practical and very helpful!
1,Postmodern Blasphemy,"This book is a prime example of popular evangelical sentimentality which is so pervasive in the Church today. Ideas presented in this book, such as everyone in the world being God's child (see John 1:10-14) and God needing our help, are absolutely blasphemous. Christians would do well to remember what the prophet said in Jeremiah 8:ll, speaking about false prophets: ""For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of My people slightly, saying, 'Peace, Peace' when there is no peace."" One star is way too many for a book that blasphemes the Holy, All Terrible God of the universe."
1,If you like a clock that lasts only a few years ...,"If you purchase something, it should last a long time. That's my philosophy. I liked this clock a lot but it stopped working after a few years for no apparent reason. I replaced the batteries with batteries I knew were good, but nada."
4,Modest Mouse meets the Beach Boys,"The cover of this album shows the duo that make up AMFM wading into the shore -- a perfect image for these songs. Think of a darker, more jaded Beach Boys (at least outwardly). Harmony is the key to some not-so-pop, much-more-grown-up sounds which gets you thinking why Brian Wilson never went in this direction.This is thinking person's music for the beach. Well done, guys."
2,boring,"Has some good elements but overall it is boring. Little articulation in the voices. Same chords repeating endlessly. As if they knew it, they sometimes try to wake you up with some surprise non-musical noise. For dozing off and falling asleep I have better CDs. This is one of the very few CDs I own which was tried several times but has finally not made it on my home media server. Goes on storage."
2,B&M 70298 Hi-Tek SuperCooler Oil Cooler with Fan,"Fan/cooler is a stout, high quality unit. Unfortunately, it is a lot bigger than the dimensions listed on Amazon or B&M;'s site .They indicate 10"" wide X 7-1/2"" high, it actually measures 10"" X 9-1/4"". The cooler itself measures 7"" high, without the inlet/outlet, mounting brackets or temperature sensor. The temp sensor's plug and wire adds another 1/4""-1/2"", depending on how tightly you want to bend the wire. That makes it 2""+ higher than advertised.Too bad it is so much taller, it will not fit my application. Looking into this a little deeper, I can build a fan and cooler, that will actually fit, using off the shelf parts, for less money."
1,Rot Stop Not!!!!,Sorry but we were immensely disappointed in this product's failure. We noticed absolutely no change or improvement with this product.
2,too noisy,"I have two boys who are 3 and 6. My 3 year old was terrified of this toy because it is very noisy(similiar to a small handheld vacuum). Once he got past the sound of it, he enjoyed it a little. It does seem to go for a while without needing more bubble solution. For what it is, there are better alternatives available."
1,Cute idea.....bad product,"Set this up, and it literally spun around one time, and then quit. There wasn't enough air blowing to even make a bubble anyways. Bad product - save your money and time and pass on this product."
1,Loud and Scary!,"I bought this for my 9 month old son because he really likes bubbles. However, he cried the second I turned this on because the device is SO loud as it makes bubbles. It scared him to the point that I got rid of the thing. No other noise has ever scared him before, and he's not a sensitive baby by any stretch. This thing is just too loud to be of any use. We hated it."
1,Made in China. 'nuf said,"received this as a gift, otherwise i would have never purchased after seeing all the terrible reviews. the motor works, the bubble solution is fine, but it won't produce bubbles. i don't think the fan/blower is forceful enough to work as it should. that is, when the ""on"" button functions. most of the time i have to hold it down for it to stay on. shame."
1,Bubbles burn eyes!,We bought this product and it came with a bottle of bubble solution. After a few minutes our baby was teary eyes because the bubbles burned her eyes. Now how can something made for the bath tub to bathe kids not have tear free bubble solution is an absolute question to me. Producers of baby products with such little thoughts in development or marketing should not be in business!
1,Never buy,Broke within an hour of playing. Waste in ever aspect. Kids were excited and then disappointed because it was a Christmas gift.
1,Piece of Junk,I purchased this a few months ago and threw it out after the first use. This seemed like it would be a fun toy for my boys as they both LOVE Bubbles but it broke during our first use. The toy apparently is not made to get wet but it is sold as a bath tub toy-go figure. As soon as the toy got wet the motor started slowing down and would no longer produce bubbles. I'm not talking submerged in water either- just wet from bath time splashing. A real piece of junk- save your money!
2,Not worth it,"I was not happy with this item. Even with the bubble reservoir completely full, only every other or every third wand produces a bubble as the wands rotate past the fan. I also didn't like that it wasn't designed to get wet - it's a BATH TOY for goodness sake! I'm returning it."
3,Fair,"Agreed, it runs out of solution very fast - the one bottle that came with the package is 3/4 gone after the very first use because you have to fill the reservoir to make bubbles. You have to order more from the manufacturer's website, it's $14.99 for a 6 pack of 4-oz. bottles. Geez. It did only run about 5 minutes of bubbles, then there were so many bubbles building up in the reservoir that it sort of stopped, or significantly slowed down. Now I'm trying to figure out how to save the solution that's in there for tomorrow without it drying up in the machine?"
1,Do not buy,"My child loves bubbles so we bought this for her. It did not work. It blew about 10 bubbles then started foaming. I followed all the instructions, cleaned it, tried again and got about the same results. For us it was a total waste of money."
4,Great entertainment in the bath,"My 16 month old loves bubbles, and bubbles in the bath is much better than bubbles on my living room carpet. The product is a little noisy...but who cares...you can barely hear it over my son's squeals from enjoyment at all the BUBBLES! I do not like the fact that there is one suction to hold it up on the bathroom wall. I would prefer two. However, it has not fallen...yet... good buy"
1,BELIEVE THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS!,"I wish I had taken the majority of reviews to heart (and usually do), but I so badly wanted them to be wrong. Nope, they're right. This thing is junk. The first one we bought never worked at all. Like a complete fool, I returned it for another one, which worked for only 1 bath despite never getting wet. Don't do it. Just don't."
1,BROKEN BEFORE I COULD EVEN LET MY KIDS TRY IT!,The product showed up fast but it was broken. I tried 3 different sets of batteries and it wouldnt work. For such a good company you would think their product would be in better shape
1,Less then impressed,"This item worked GREAT the first time we used it....it poured out the bubbles, almost too much! The second time we used it, it was much less and by the third day it wasn't working at all. I ended up throwing it away before the week was done. Very disappointed. Great idea for bath-time, but poor product. Save your money."
1,"Great idea, bad execution","This was really cool - while it worked. It makes lots of bubbles, and a huge mess - so make sure it is aimed in the tub. But, the suction cups don't hold well. Ours dropped off the wall and into the tub. The motor was fried after two more uses. It is marketed as a bath toy, but CANNOT get wet. Either skip it, or rig up a way to ensure it doesn't fall in the tub."
2,Not worth it.,"Disappointed with another baby item gimmick. This product only blows bubbles if full of solution, when half full, you have to refill. It stopped working soon after purchase, then started up again a few weeks later, then back to not working. Half the time it just foamed bubbles spilling out of the fill dish.Don't waste your money."
2,VERY noisy!!,"I bought this for my son thinking it would be fun for his baths. We've only used it a few times but the darn thing is so noisy! My son is a bit hestitant about it because of the noise. It does blow tons of bubbles. In fact, I think it blows too many, too fast. It'd be a much better toy if it were less noisy and had different bubble speed options. I would keep searching for a bubble maker if I were you."
1,Who makes a bath toy that's not waterproof??,"Only managed to use this once with my 8 month old. The instructions say ""do not submerse"". Well, it's a heavy toy with only one (inferior) suction cup to hold it up. It splashed briefly into the water when my daughter predictably tried to touch the unit, and while it continued to work for that bath, it hasn't worked since. I honestly think it would have stopped working if it had just gotten a couple of good splashes. Really disappointing - we have other electronic bath toys that seal up watertight, why doesn't this?Also, the fan on it was obnoxiously loud when it did work. Definitely not worth purchasing!"
1,Not worth the money!,"I bought this for my son because he LOVES bubbles and thought this would be a great item for him. It was a complete waste of money! It worked great the first time, but never again! Anytime we tried to use it, it would just spit bubbles down the front of it, the wheel didn't spin and half the time it didn't do anything at all except make a mouse like it was trying to spin. Don't know if I got a dud or what but I would not recommended it to anyone! Save your money & just buy a bottle of bubbles & blow them yourself."
2,God Fearing Women,I got the Winnie the Pooh Summer Infant bubble blower. It doesn't put out much bubbles. Also the holes they put in it to make it a sucure packaging. Well the solution leaks out of the bottoms hole ect. My son put it in the bath water and now it don't work at all. I would not waste your money on this bubble blower. My hand held cheaper one from Cracker Barrell has been put in the bath water and has a broken battery door on it and it still in running great and gives out alot of bubbles.
1,Can I give it ZERO stars?,"This item is awful. What a fun idea, and oh how poorly executed. This item is cruddy. Very very poorly designed. The bubbles don't gently float up like they do in the picture. It's more like a full on bubble assault! They shoot out in an aggressive horizontal line. It's terrible. You could NEVER sit your kid in front of it like they do in the picture. They would be taking an aggressive onslaught of bubbles to the face!! Oh!! And did I mention, their bubble solution BURNS!?!? You would think something they picture as floating into a child's face would have the sense to be tear free but I can promise you this is not. It got into my eyes and stung like crazy. What a poorly designed product. I returned mine immediately. When I went to remove my batteries to do so, i could see that the inside of the battery compartment was slimy with bubble solution. This, after ONE abbreviated use! This is a very poor quality product. Avoid!"
1,Would not produce bubbles.,I purchased this for my 3 year old son. He loves taking baths and loves bubbles. We turned it on and all it did was spit the bubble solution. I tried adding more solution and it just kept doing the same thing. My son was so disappointed. I wish had my receipt to take it back. It was not worth spending any money on.
2,Good idea but...,My daughter loves baths & bubbles so we got this...but it came with only a small amount of bubble mix. THe catch -- do not use dish soap to fill OR regular bubble mix...so you've gotta use their special mixture to refill bubbles. We went through the whole container of bubble mix in less ten a week. I tried a few other bubble mixes and they didn't seem to make the bubbles as nicely. Then it stalled...so overall...a good idea...but it doesn't last.
2,Doesn't spin,"I just got this and I wish it worked better. The wands spin sporadically, sometimes stopping completely. When they do spin it works nicely - even if they just rotate a little and then stop because it gives time for bubbles to come out. It's just a low quality toy. What a shame."
1,Waste of Money!!!!,We were so excited to use this... rushed home and got the bath tub all ready... the thig woekrd for maybe 2 montues and then never again produced another bubble. So Sad. :(
2,Very unhappy,"This product is not worth your money. It works maybe twice with the push of a button and then never again when you want it to. We got it for use in the bathtub but its aweful. Bubbles spill out, the suction doesn't work most of the time, the button is useless. Very disappointed with this Garanimals product."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"We bought this item a few years ago for our kids. It doesn't blow many bubbles, it is very loud, and it does not stay up in the tub. It actually fell off the wall and onto our then 2-year-old son! It was so loud they were scared of it. What a disappointing toy."
2,Broke after battery replacement,"Well, the thing was pretty good and interesting while it was working and it was working for about a week; after a week the batteries dies (that's ok), but replacing batteries did not activate the item; so, the batteries are new, but the bubblemaker does not work - simply does not work;"
2,Don't buy it...wish I had read the reviews first!,"I bought this toy at a store thinking it would entertain my little one when she has been fussy in the evening. I wish I would have read all the negative reviews on here first! They are all right! I have gone through the entire bottle after FIVE uses and just as another reviewer said, even when the reservoir has the bubble solution in it, it only sends out a couple of bubbles after 30 seconds of use. I have it high on the wall, so I haven't gotten it wet yet. Bottom line, this toy just isn't worth it. I'm sure there is a cuter one and better quality one out there."
4,Baby loves the bubbles!,"The bubble blower is a bit noisy, as other reviewers have said, but with the sound of the bath or the shower to accompany it, its barely noticable. Its a toy bubble blower and my 5 month old loves it! The only downside for us is that the bubble solution is $14.99 to purchase additional. I'm not sure what size bottle it comes with and from what i can tell, it is only available through the manufacturer."
5,For the clipper challenged,"I love these angled clippers to trim hang nails and other dry skin around my nail beds. I cannot maneuver the cuticle trimmers that nail technicians use very well, so these do the trick."
3,"Not the best socks, but a good value","I rate socks on three points, comfort, durability, and staying up. These socks are quite comfortable even after multiple washings. I expect them to be durable as well. The elastic does only an average job of preventing slipping."
1,Holy Mother of Socks!,"I bought a 12 pack of these black ""Gold Toe"" socks on August 2nd 2K5. Let that sink in for a moment. Here is a guy who bought socks TEN months ago, and went through his Amazon history to track down this product.The fabric of the socks is a very thin material. Which I guess is pretty standard for black socks.However, these Gold Toes develop holes at an alarming rate. I have thrown 9 (out of 24) socks in the garbage because of holes or tears. While the Gold Toe corporation might interject ""Hey, thats not even 33%!"", what they didn't realize is I only wear black socks 1 day a week!Time for some math!40 uses / 12 pair = 3.3 washes to failureCan that be right? I'll be the first to admit I have no idea what the average life expectancy of a sock is, but it has to be greater than 3 washes to be worth purchasing."
1,Awful,"Bought 4 pairs, all have holes within 8 months. Completely ridiculous considering the 'premium' price. They used to be much better, I've bought them off and on for 15 years, but no more."
1,Gold Toe Men's 12-Pack Black Fluffie Crew Socks,"Tried these and then sent them back. They will not stay up, they end up around your ankle. When washed they shrunk almost 20% in length. Also they ""Are Not"" Fluffie, not even a little bit. They were not worth the special low price."
1,Poor Quality,I ripped three new sox in a week. Tears right below the ankle. poor craftsmanship and material. Does anyone have a suggestion for a great pair of sox?
3,English Mystery Lives!,"These are well-acted stories about everyday people who find themselves involved in a mystery. The settings are commonplace, but varied and interesting. The plots are not predictable, but not always satisfying. They vary in quality, and generally lack the pizzaz of Agatha Christie stories. The cast lacks glamor."
2,Totally pointless,"""The Double"", which is the shortest episode in this set, is completely unsatisfactory. It has no particular structure, no particular ending, no particular character development. The sub-plot involving the stocks seems to be irrelevant. This is not ambiguity, which does have a place in literature and film; it is just frustration."
5,great book,"I love this book, it gives a lot of good ideas and got me very motivated to work on my house!"
1,music on CD OK. advertisement at end is infuriating!!,"The music on this CD is predictable, good old standard stuff. Exactly what I thought I was paying for. What I didn't know I was paying for was the lengthy advertisement at the tail end of this CD. I want ads, I listen to the radio for free. I want music with no ads, I buy a CD. I paid my money, but got ripped off on this one. Unless you like ads blaring on your stereo rather than music, you'll pick another recording."
3,Not very Roman,"I owned this CD for a few years and then it was off to the used CD store. I found the performances, while very well played by the New York Phil., simply dull. I think the late conductor took the music too seriously, playing it like Johannes Brahms. The passion and fire are simply nowhere to be found. If Maestro Sinopoli was trying to make this music better than it really is, he was making a mistake. Better to simply to play the music as it was intended. In other words, have fun with it."
3,Not at all a Bad Performance with Sinopoli,"Both ""Pines of Rome"" and ""Fountains of Rome"" played by Sinopoli with the New York Phil lack a bit of musical and instrumental effect compared to Karajan with the Berlin Phil, recorded on the same company. On ""Fountains of Rome"", the orchestra is less expressive and more apathetic. One ""Pines of Rome"", the climatic movement is rather very slow, less bold and very loosely performed. However, I think both recording is okay. The ""Roman Festivals"" is performed almost like most regular performances, lacking energy a bit on the climax. Or is it that Bernstein's performance with the New York Phil on ""Roman Festivals"" is untraditionally very unique ,yet extremely exciting, with all the revealing sounds of the tambarines and the tam-tam?On the other hand, I pretty much like this CD. The performance with my favorite American orchestra is not at all bad, especially the climax of ""The Pines of Rome"", slow tempo, but enough triumph to show."
3,Not bad but,"why would you buy this when you could buy Fritz Reiner's legendary performance with the CSO for less $$? I can't think of any reason.When I got the Reiner CD, this one became a gift to a non-discriminating friend (who I hope doesn't read this)!"
4,Good value product,"Like some other massage equipment fans here, I also own several massage items - foot massager, neck, chair cushion and even one of those expensive sharper image massage chairs. This is a great product. The shiatsu massaging mechanism on this items feels identical to the one in the Homedics neck massager (which I own, too) but this is in a much more comfortable and versatile form. The cushion is easy to manouevre for your back, your neck or your feet. I also like strong massage, and this item works well for me. I wish it was slightly smaller, so that I could take it with me when I travel. Out of all the Homedics massage products I've purchased (four, not including this one), I would recommend this one the most. It was also the last one I bought - and I would have skipped the others if this one had been available first; it makes the others obsolete."
5,Great Little Machine!!,"This little massager has been doing me a miracle kneading out my sore back muscles!! I simply place it on my desk chair and lean into it gently, and it hits the spot with the right amount of pressure everytime. After a good 10-minute session, I'm fresh as daisy!! At times, it works as a foot massager too when I put it on the arches of my foot. For the price of the equipment, it's been giving me a great payback."
5,Good for sore places,"We got this product after seeing another family member receive one for Christmas. My wife has fibromyalgia and sees a therapist regularly, plus she has various other products to massage tightened muscles. This cushion is good in that it can be directed at the particular spot needed. Also the two massaging elements give a really vigorous action. I have used it also to relieve a sore lower back. It's not for a broad area, but it does deliver as advertized: it stimulates a particular place on your back or neck."
1,Disappointment,"DO NOT waste your time, this product only massages 4-5"" of an area height at a time...very disappointing! It is very uncomfortable in the area you want massaged as it is about 5-6"" thick so your body is thrown out of alignment. I had more problems AFTER using this product than before. PLEASE save yourself the backache and do not use this product!!!! If I could give this product negative stars, I would.Lori S.Houston, TX"
3,Much wider than expected,"I bought this massaging cushion thinking it would be great on your back but what I found was it to be wider than most shiatsu massagers. My daughter, 11, cannot use it. It rubs on her shoulder blades. It does mine, too. The powerful revolving massage ""fingers"" work great if you can get them in the right spot on your back (you might have to turn it sideways.) I ended up finding a smaller shiatsu massager that works for all of us. As for this one, we use it mostly for tired feet which it works great for, and it also works well under the back of your legs. As a back massager, you probably need to have a wide back."
4,LMHNEVADA,This really helps me alot with tension relief in my neck and upper back. I do have to put a towel over the roller balls because it really digs deep and is pretty intense. It is sort of loud if you are trying to watch TV and do the massage at this same time.
3,"Realistic massage, but a little rough","This massage cushion is quite realistic as it feels like actual hands / knuckles massaging you. The problem is that there is no way to adjust the amount of pressure and it can be too much for a sensitive lower back area. It can be great for shoulders and neck, but its shape makes it a bit of a challenge to postion correctly. I had to stop using on the lower back as it caused me unusual pains. These pains went away a couple of days after stopping use."
3,Good for the money,This item gives a good hard massage for the money. I hope sometime to get one that moves up and down the back on it's own. It's a little inconvenient moving it to all the places I want it to hit.
3,a little bulky for me,"this feels nice while it's on, but you sure can't just sit there after you turn it off...it's way too bulky and uncomfortable to keep in your chair all the time. So, you have to move it back and forth when you want to use it and that can get old. I'd prefer something I could just turn off and on and leave in the chair all the time, but it does give a nice massage when I take the time to hook it up."
4,Awsome,"I love this massager. It's fantastic. I have another one with this brand name, but the little massagers move up and down your back. It works really well, but I really needed something for spot work. This one fits the bill 100%. It was absolutely worth the money spent."
3,BACKACHE,This massager actually caused more pain than pleasure. I have other massagers and this one is by far the worst.
5,Great on feet,"I bought this primarily for my feet and works great. Also good for upper back where the Homedics 400 model with heat and quad rollers don't reach. THAT kinda irritated me, as it advertised as being FULL BACK....and their intrep. of full back is only half way up....and was too much of a hassle and lost money on restocking fees to return...a monster built-into the machine, I think....I believe in truth in advertising. So with that noted, if you buy any of the full back massagers, you will indeed need to buy this and find a way to do your upper mid-back and shoulders and this thing is powerful....on my feet, one does have to learn where and at what angle to place your feet without it being uncomfortable but most foot massagers just fibrate..that's it. This 100 model really gets in deep and works on hands as well, for my peripheral neuropathy. Buy it, you will be impressed!"
2,don't bother,"this product is awful. It is heavy, uncomfortable and cumbersome. You can't relax while using it, because you are constantly repositioning yourself (or the cushion) because it actually starts to hurt if you don't! Do not waste your money. I sent mine back today."
5,Ahhhhh,"This is a massager for the frugal (most of the population). It's just as good as any massage chair that I've sat on in the mall, except it only works about 1/4 of your back at a time. So what you do is just strap it on to the chair, start on your lower back, and then stick a hand behind you and lift the pillow up when you want to go up higher. Is that slight inconvenience is worth $80 to you?. If you're looking for a VERY relaxing experience and to get all of the kinks out of your back and don't want to spend a ton of money, this is probably the best thing you can buy. If you're looking for the MOST relaxing experience possible and money is no object, I suggest forking over three times the money for a full back massager."
4,It just can not get any better for less than $50,I have tried many massagers but this one surely is the worth for money. It just can't get any better for less than $50. Little inconvenient to move due to the size but still worth it. The hard mode actually feels more comfortable than the soft mode. Go for it........
3,"Great Service, decent game","The service of the vendor/supplier was excellent, but the game isn't what I expected. a true classic, but how often do you want to drive a model T when all you want is speed."
4,Worthwhile for students of cognitive science,"The book is worth reading and it does highlight some of the contemporary areas of research in cognitive science. I don't think that it is necessary that one ought to buy it, you are likely to find a copy in some library or somewhere on the internet.The first chapter is laborious to read and is full of jargons. The topic of 'modularity of mind' isn't presented well enough and is confused with 'modularity of brain' by the contributing authors but the rest of the chapters are good specially the ones about language as well as rationality.The book is a little dated, it is from 2006 but, the topics it discusses still bare relevance in 2013 and are a worthy matter for philosophical discourse.I would also recommend you to have a look at ""The Philosophy of Psychology and Cognitive Science"" edited by Paul Thagard. Though that book is even more dense and can be difficult to read it is more thorough and well structured.Best,Sam"
3,Picture Perfect,"This is a very sweet romantic comedy that stars Jennifer Aniston. She portrays an ad agency copywriter that is involved with fellow costar Kevin Bacon. He is the company bad boy, and she is just too good for him. When she gets involved with Jay Mohr, she finds herself falling for him. I was surprised to find I liked Jay Mohr's character. I have never liked him in anything I have seen him in, but this is definitely the exception. This movie is enjoyable, but very predictable."
3,This isn't a bad film. I liked it.,"Jennifer Aniston used her best acting ability. She was just as good in this film as she was on the Friends T.V.show. She showed much of her personality in this film. She can be strong and assertive but at the same time, she could be humorous and fun to be with. If you don't want to buy the movie at least rent it."
3,"AVERAGE, AVERAGE, AVERAGE","I think this movie was very average. Jennifer Aniston was cute and the acting was about the same as on friends. I feel they put too much emphasus on Jennifer's body and really had her in ridiculous skimpy outfits. It's too bad when you have a beautiful young women with obvious talent, they have to over play her sexuality. I also think Kevan Bacon was seriously miscast, to fine an actor to be in such bad movie. He must have been strapped for cash! If you want an average watchable kind of movie then go for it. Most definiltey not worth owning and certainly worth forgetting."
5,really enjoyable film,"I saw this film a while back, and I loved it so much I bought it on dvd. It has a great storyline and great acting. I am a fan of jenifer aniston as well as jay mohr so this film was great for me. I can truely say its one of my favorite films."
3,Not Bad,"A nice, romantic movie that's a perfect vehicle for Jennifer Aniston.Jay Mohr is good as the man she 'arranges' to be her boyfriend to impress her boss and hook the office romeo.Worth renting at least."
3,"Not quite picture perfect, but cute none the less...","Jennifer Aniston stars in this romantic comedy and does a great job at her performance. I enjoyed her acting and the acting of Jay Mohr and Kevin Bacon, but the story line could have been better. It didn't really pull on my heartstrings like a lot of other romantic comedys out there. I would compare it to that teacher you had in Junior High, you know the one that taught health (a realitively unexciting class) who was a good teacher, but years down the line you can't quite remember her name. Well this is that movie...you love Jennifer Aniston, but years down the line you won't be able to remember if you've ever seen this movie, or you will remember seeing it, but not remember the plot.As it is, a good movie for what it's worth. Light and doesn't require a lot of thinking. I wouldn't suggest buying it, but renting might not be a bad idea."
4,Loved it,"Although it seems that few people liked the film, I thought it was pretty good. As in most romantic comedies, the plot was pretty predictable, but all the actors did a great job. I love it."
2,Why do I care about these people?,"The story is completely predictable. The characters are pretty to look at, but not all that pleasant or interesting. It's not the worst way to pass ninety minutes, but there's little to recommend it."
5,"This movie is highly reccomened, at least by me!","This movie was touching, sweet anf funny. Jennifer Aniston did a GREAT job. Watching this movie makes you fall in love with Jay Mohr! I love this movie and it is perfect for a bunch of teenagers (girls, though; this really isn't a guy's movie) who wanna relax on a Friday night! Watch it for garanteed enjoyment! Anyone who doesn't like it obviously has a MAJOR prob! Love, Julia"
1,waste of time,"This movie was one of the most hideous movies I have ever seen. It was dreadfully boring, had a flat and unintelligent plot, and was full of the worst acting I have ever witnessed. Aniston shows no talent whatsoever, and is almost sickening to watch. I felt as though I had wasted two hours of my time, and walked away from the movie feeling stupider than I have ever before. Please do not watch this movie. It was a regetable mistake."
1,boring,"wow this was incredibly boring. preview made it look good, but it isn't worth time or money that i spent on it. super cheesy."
3,Perfect Dress!,"jenn looks so fab in that date dress with the low cut top, high cut skirt outfit to beat the band, and she just shucks off her sexuality which makes this fare even more intriguing, so it is lacking plot complexities but so fun to see Kevin bad boy and Jay good boy role, for me, I am satisfied with this fare, exciting steamy moments that excite the imagination and the dinner scene was the epitome of bring out the talent show... the little black book diary for the history lesson should be mandatory Love 101 for potential lovers/spouses/FWB, etc., I have had limited success with this approach due to the 180 of written vs spoken word, men should know this applies as well to women... wake up lads!! nice packaged script with limited dissapointments, decent recommend!"
5,Love!!!!!,"Love Jennifer Anniston! Often gets a bad wrap re: her movies but she is adorable! Lord knows, I/we need a break from all of the horror on tv nowadays! Also, since becoming a member/customer of Amazon, I have been quite happy with all of my purchases and the sellers. BIG THANKS!"
5,"Its the quality, not the quanity that counts!","A single CD can only contain so much greatness, thats why only six tracks. ""oklahoma"" and ""live another day"" are effectively poingnant. ""Kurt"" is mortality satire. ""Jeruselm"" wanders in and out of a love song. ""Talkin,Alien abduction blues"" is sci-fi satire. ""Hannibal"" Im still working on this one, but I suppose its about narrow minded biggots. I always play the whole CD, and sometimes once isnt enough. what can I say, Dan's the Man"
5,The only Sherlock Holmes worth the name,"There have been many portrayals of Sherlock but in my opinion, Jeremy Brett was the best. (Read about his dedication to the role, on Wickipedia) These Granada productions always visually excellent, locations spot on. Altogether a classy series and not to be bettered (in my opinion) by these modern remakes. To give proper due, prior to Jeremy, Basil Rathbone gave a good performance."
1,almost child like,"the other viewer was pretty on, some of the so called doctors said some really strange meaningless things. the whole experience was very child like and amateurish i looked for the release date it was 2007 it seems more like late 80's the dvd major organs has been the worst, i would suggest if you really want some good info you will look else where to spend your money. i work as a personal trainer, yoga and chef so i have been studying the mind, body and spirit for about 15 years, one thing i thought was sad, here these doctors and health professionals are promoting the human body and its functions and the girl in the video seems to be eating an oreo cookie talk about going against your bodies natural functions, just thought that to be very strange. over all the dvd quality was very poor, save yourself the trouble look else where."
1,Very Amatuer,"Like the other reviewers stated, hard to define the intended audience. Definitely very childish. Don't waste your money here. If you are looking for general system introductions (30 min) in an easily digestible format veiwable for high school or college level students I would reccomend the Body Atlas series, published by TLC. If you want indepth lectures (45 minute segments) on each system I would recommend Understanding the Human Body with Anthony Goodman published by The Teaching Company. It is an expensive but excellent resource."
3,blah,"Well, this video/dvd is boring. I can barely hear the speakers. It moves very slow. I think middle school kids would be very bored."
2,I gave my copy away,I'm sure someone will like it.I read through a few places and then put it in the outgoing bin.
3,Hardcore,"the band is not so classic, just for people who likes 70's or 80's hardcore, don't take it bad, it has some good songs like ""violent society"" or ""you're doing yourslef not good"". but at the middle of the cd it turns some monotonous. maybe other people would like more than I like!. in the vein of the Partisans, Abrasive Wheels, G.B.H."
3,"Looks cool, but sounds like a baby's toy",I bought this because I thought my son would like it -- the color scheme of the Cobra Snake Squeeze Horn matched the colors of his bicycle. The head of the cobra snake doesn't look bad -- but the sound it makes sounds like a baby's squeeze toy. He had me take it off immediately after he got home from school -- the sound was too embarrassing.
3,these songs are about us!,"while no songs on this cd are classics(except""SURVIVORS"")if you were to turn off the t.v.,throw away the newspaper,and turn on the stereo AND LISTEN,you will hear songs that tell about you and what you have gone through,what you went through growing up,what you like to remember as well as what you would like to forget.these songs will make you ""feel""sit back,listen,and go home again.and mr.kane,there is nothing uncomfortable about patriotism. enjoy, js99@gateway.net"
5,A Collection of Great Standards,This is one of the best CD's I have ever bought. Every song is good.
1,"Ear plugs, please!","This guy is one of the greatest musical con artists in a long time...he's got all the moves and inflections down pat, but he can't carry a tune past his lips! Don't waste your money!!!!!"
1,Mediocre,A lot of the less familiar poetry in this collection is just plain terrible. The baby boomer poets are the worst of all. It's depressing. You're better off with a Norton anthology.
5,Spectacular,"I say spectacular, not just as hyperbole but, in the sense of seeing, these lovely bits of pastiche actually evoke images of paintings by early masters. They are beautifully played and recorded, and the interpretations are crisp and lively. I've always loved the Antal Dorati recording, but these are a stunning addition to any collection."
3,Good value for the money,"Nothing special about this lawnmower, but it gets the job done for not a lot of money. We don't have much grass, so this lawnmower is all we need."
5,Great shoe.,Extremely comfortable yet dressy shoe. I just wish this sole system (Skywalk)was available in a wingtip slip-on or laceup. Fast service also.
3,"A little disappointed, but it was OK","I was expecting a more solid and sturdy looking pair of shoes that can go with rather a formal wear, but it turned out to be light and very casual shoes with rubber bottom. It feels more like a slipper rather than shoes, just as exactly the name implied. I knew there was always a risk involved when ordering an unfamiliar product from the picture so I paid the price for this time. But it should be ok if I wear it for light occasions, I guess."
4,An entertaining book on real world physics,"This book is a breath of fresh air. Contrary to some books where abstract theories are discussed at length but whose connection with reality remains elusive, this book contains calculations on phenomena in the real and currently observable world. Approximations, i.e., back-of-the-envelope calculations, are performed for a great variety of physics topics that makes for truly fascinating reading. The math is mostly high school level with a small dash of calculus in a few cases. The text is clear and engaging and complements the calculations very well. The reason that I am giving it four stars instead of five is that there are several typos in the calculations and the units are not always carried through, i.e., numbers are often presented dimensionless when they are not. Otherwise, a fascinating read that I heartily recommend."
3,naked,"Faerie Whispers is both raw and exposing.While reading these poems I often felt like a Peeping Tom, spying into a troubled life, flaunted on bitter pages. Definitely not a ""joy read""... poems flip between the crazed sexoholic and physically abused.Emotionally jarring, Faerie Whispers mental images tend to be crude and often beg the reader for pity... Perhaps this is what it feels like to be naked and viewed with jaded eyes, a masochistic author who gleans satisfaction by unnerving the world around her."
5,Essays on life,"Each chapter in this book is a separate essay - and each has very important and helpful truths.My favorite chapter in the book is one titled ""What is Greatness?"".Whenever I feel very hurt by the actions of others - or angry - I remember this essay. Sometimes I pull it out and read it again. It's about how hard it can be to love people sometimes - and why we should do so anyway.This is the key to ending vengeful wars and petty disagreements. This is really such a beautiful, life-changing piece of work.You can see that particular essay on line - then buy the book, it's full of gems!http://www.realhubbard.org/"
5,A Collection of Well-Written Essays on Life--A Great Read!,"In this book Hubbard shines as an essayist. Like the finale of a fireworks show, it's just one well-written essay after another.With titles like, ""Is it possible to be happy?"" and ""How to live with children,"" there is something in here for everyone.While not an essay on the specifics of Scientology (see the book ""What is Scientology?"" for that), it does give the flavor of Scientology philosophy: an accent on ability, awareness and responsibility.You'll feel better just reading this book!"
5,Real Answers to Real Life,"I loved this book! With chapter titles like ""Is It Possible To Be Happy?"", ""Two Rules For Happy Living"", and ""Honest People Have Rights, Too"", Hubbard covers alot of ground in helping to understand ""Life"". He describes how a person gets to be in the state they are, and gives real solutions. I found some tools in this book that are nowhere else...and I've looked! The paperback is great! No qualms about underlining particularly useful parts, or lines that immediately make sense. I read 5 to 6 books a month, and this one is a keeper"
2,What the heck?!!,"I was curious about scientology, so I decided to give this book a try. I still have no idea what scientology is or what this book is about. It is definitely not for the casual reader and is not easy to read. This is not a good primer to scientology; I'm sure there's much more clearer books out there. This one is very confusing!"
5,"Wow, Wow, Wow.","What a great book! This book works very well and was very easy to apply to my life and any one that I have shown it to or let read. This book changed my life for the better in many ways. The chapter I use the most is called ""On Bring Order"" this chapter would bring about face to anyone's life that is in disorder! Thanks, Tim P.S. Not to mention how it has improved my business!"
2,Uncertain,"After taking the prescribed dose for three weeks, I found no change in the way I felt. Maybe I didn't have the right condition for the drug,(muscle stiffness and joint aches). But I found zero benefit from taking it."
2,The side effects,"I'm sure this product is very good, but the fatigue that I experienced kept me from truly seeing the results that I needed. I felt drugged throughout the day...very sluggish. I thought it was just me, but when I realized that it started once I began taking the MSM, I looked up the side effects online and yes, fatigue is one of them."
4,Nature's Way,Love taking this and so far it has helped with my joints Just wish the tablets where smaller. Have hard time swallowing.
5,always good,I take these everyday. They're good for lubing joints and for reducing inflammation. Great for reducing the symptoms of arthritis.
4,I actually bought these for my dog....,"I have my dog on an array of supplements for joint health as a preventative, and bought these to add to the mix. No idea if they actually work, BUT the package came sealed, doesn't expire for over a year, and arrived quickly. The dog isn't too keen on eating them....."
4,pain relief,MSM helped reduce my horrible period cramps and it helps with my arthritis in my hips..It also helps me grow my hair
1,Horrible Product,"This is just a horrible product. It works no better than a standard tube. When it does flat and one tries to repair it the slime will come spewing out of the tube when pumping air into the tire to find said puncture. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS JUNK! Also the glueless patches don't work either. The worst part? I bought 6 of these tubes and each failed as described. This product DOESN'T WORK, DOESN'T WORK, DOESN'T WORK!"
1,Not worth the money or the mess!,"After four rides of less than 100 miles on relatively smooth road, I got a flat on my rear wheel. When I looked over the tire, I found no punctures or cuts. Upon removing the tube I was surprised to find that the rear Slime Lite tube leaked at the valve stem base. Green slime all over my rim and hands and no way to repair the tube. While these tubes may have been a good idea, the downfall of this product is the poor quality at the valve stem. Sorry I never got to see if these would withstand the test of road debris. Definitely not worth the extra expense."
3,not exactly!,"well, the tube was holding for a while; and I was rather satisifed.yet, when it got ""pinched"" or ""punchtered"" I'm not sure ..it didn'treally sealed itself; but rather oozed green slime when I tried tore-pump it back to riding pressure (presta). eventually, I had toreplace the tube as it didn't ""heal"" altogether!one nice thing, though, if you do get a pinche/puncture the grenslime shows you more or less where it's leaking :(I then applied a slime patch; after cleaning it, and manage to ridejust about 12 or so miles before it gave up; I replaced it with aspare tube. maybe it's the rim or the road I was taking -- it didlast more then a regular tube of about this weight 100+ gram."
1,POOR QUALITY CONTROL OR JUST POOR QUALITY ?,"Three Slime tubes have failed in one day. First one had a slow leak, so replaced it with a new one and it blew out right along the seam. I did keep from falling. I then replaced the blown one with a new tube and it had two leaks in different places as it was being inflated. Installation was performed properly. You may make your own conclusion about buying Slime bicycle tubes. As for me, when you are paying close to $9.00 per tube, they should at least get you out the door and some sort of replacement guarantee should be in place. I have one more Slime tube, what do you predict will happen with it ?"
5,Excellence in craftsmanship,"I must say that previous to having in my hand the Tronex Model 7223, I did have a very good pair of flush cutters, but this Tronex model 7223 is soooo excellent in cutting to the tiniest detail in wire jewelry. I am so pleased with them, and they are worth every bit their price and give my wire jewelry pieces a professional look. If you want to do excellent work, invest in the very best of tools - these are a must for wireworkers."
5,Super great!,These cutters are worth the price (an arm and a leg). They make my jewelry look even more professional and are a pleasure to use. Wish I had found them 10 years ago.
1,Have yet to receive ONE issue!,I ordered Wine Spectator as a Christmas gift for my Husband. The first issue was supposed to arrive by February 12. It is March 31 and we have yet to receive the first issue. I have emailed and called Amazon to inquire about the missing issues and have not heard back. I would recommend purchasing this subscription elsewhere.***UPDATE*** it is now May and we FINALLY received our first issue. But this was only after MANY calls!! Don't buy this magazine from here.
1,Wine spectator subscription.,I really cannot review this product as I have yet to recieve it!!! Order placed on 7/25/08 and it is currently 9 weeks later-9/29/08 and I have yet to see a copy of this magazine.
4,time lapse,"In this day ang age of immediate response, I have still to only guess why a magazine publisher needs 6-8 weeks of turn around time. The people for whom this gift was intended will be old before they receive their first magazine in their subscription year."
5,worked perfectly,great - first issue arrived much sooner than expected - Bible of wine - cheers & enjoy! - three more words
5,The One I Get,"This is the wine magazine I get. It has good timely information and coverages most aspects of wine. One weaker area is cooking, but there are other magazines for that and I look for WINE coverage in a wine magazine. The format is large (about twice the area of a normal magazine), which can be cumbersome and not so easy to read when standing in line and reading. The layout is clean and edited well. The columns are informative and on-topic. All in all, probably the only wine magazine that I will continue to get on a regular basis."
2,very short....,"I'm 5'6...and these are just an inch(barely) above my knee....and thats really stretching it....just for show, not really for much production if you get what i mean."
4,"Beautiful and soft, but a little too long for me","These stockings are very sexy, soft to the touch. They are not sheer, once they're thick, but they pleased me very much. However, I found them too long for me (I'm 5'3) and it's not that I can't use it, but they go like too high in my leg, almost to the point of my tushy.I use it anyway, I just though other people could find this information interesting. This was a wonderful purchase for the stockings are really good and pretty!"
1,Worked good at first.......,"but after 5 weeks it no longer displayed the caller-id number. All calls displayed as ""unavailable"". Of course, I checked the jack with another caller-id unit. Thankfully, I was still within Amazon's return period. While it's tempting to order another one - to see if I have better luck - I'm permitting wisdom's guidance to steer me away from doing that."
4,Product review and faults,"I like this product. The only things wrong is when I plugged it in it gives the wrong time. Runs about 15 minutes slow. Also the light in the right hand corner does not light up when I have a call. Otherwise, it is a good product."
2,Disappointing,This is a disappointing caller ID box. It does not identify many of the numbers that my wall phone can.
2,just ok,"I shopped for a product with a message-waiting light (phone company voicemail; i.e., stutter tone). It's the one feature that does not work on these. Oh well. Everything else seems to work."
2,product arrived in different package than the picture shows,"Dear AmazonI was always pleased what I ordered on Amazon, but not this time- but this is not Amazon fault.I ordered Madame Rochas Eau the Toilette as the picture shows, but I received Madame Rochas in different packaging (this version is cheaper). The product sent me by merchant appears to be a very cheap imitation of the original and thi is not what I ordered. It does not lasts and has very poor quality. I would not recommed this merchant to anybody until the merchant will stick what he advertises. I should receive refund from this dishonet merchand.I previously used Madam Rochas Eau the Toilette as the merchant advertised and his picture shows (this frangrance originally was made in France and was wonderful).Trulu YoursM. PoleszczukSIN:B0009RV9WW Perfume by Rochas, ( MADAME ROCHAS EAU DE TOILETTE SPRAY 3.4 oz.]]"
1,they changed it,"My mom used to wear this perfume and it was divine. I have not bought it from Amazon, but I did buy a bottle recently and it is nothing like what it used to be.It is a pity that the great perfume recipes are being changed and cheapened. It is a great loss. Madame Rochas used to be fabulous -- but not anymore."
1,Far from the Original,"I use to wear this in my mid-twenties and was nostalgically longing for it. I was surprised I couldn't find it in any stores and so decided to go on line. Clearly whoever took over ""Rochas"" has changed the formula. I find the new fragrance strong and repulsive, sort of like too much generic old lady perfume. No hint of the original slightly musky-patchouli-sweet smell. A complete waste of my money."
5,Best I've heard so far,"Many musicians play with with brains, only few do with hearts - And even fewer pour their hearts out with consistency are legends. Mutter had seemingly rewritten the arrangement and absorbed it so solidly which led to a performance that blooms with such great passion and distinct personality aided by her transcendental techniques. I had felt an instant connection with her the very first time I heard it. It's also sonically pleasing even to the audiophiles. It's a recording for music fans who truely understand and appreciate music on a very sophisticated level..."
1,CD Carmen-Fantasie received,The CD of Carmen-Fantasie I received from the vendor is actually not in working order...I do not think the vendor had done quality control of the CD before shipment.
2,Mixed Reaction,"I heard a lot about Ms. Mutter and heard her performances on radio a few times, but this was the first time I got one of her recordings and listened carefully into her performances. I must say that my reaction is mixed.First, on negatives... I was amazed that at a few places, she was simply and glaringly out of pitch. For example, in 'Meditation', she played the high F# of the first section way sharp. The orchestra and the soloist were off-pace at times. On expressive slow phrases, the tone wasn't warm enough. Rather, it was coarse and felt artificially suppressed.In contrast, she exhibited great clarity and brilliance on virtuouso phrases. It seemed she was much more comfortable with 'devilishly' difficult phrases than slow sentimental phrases. I also felt that her articulation on 'gypsy' phrases was excellent--full of energy and raw emotion."
3,Only use these as a 2nd choice,They serve there purpose and will help to prevent a disk from being scratched but I prefer the hard plastic MediaZone (LaserLine) disk sleeves.
4,A fine reading,"Only K331 here is worthy of comment as K284 is an easy piece and 497 is a fragment.Pogorelech's carefull reading of 331 gives a delightful result.From sforzando to piano is a difficult move and he brings it off perfectly. His tempi seem just right to me everywhere. The phrasing in divine. Any great player can bring off the alla Turka, but his minuet and espectially the theme and variations are peerless. No other performers I have heard observe the subtleties of dynamics and tempo the way Ivo does, although some might object to his sometimes pronounced rubatos and half dotting of notes that are not so indicated in the score."
2,bad rendition,notes stuck together as if glued. In general very clumsy. Unlike Haskil or Uchida's Mozart that were more like small glass balls falling on glass floor with crystal clear sound....
1,Disappointing,"Well.. it does hurt at the back - usually, Aerosoles are so comfortable, but this is an exception.. in a bad way."
1,very little foot support-unexpected for aerosoles,These shoes are unlike typical aerosoles - they don't fit very well (somehow the foot sits really high and the surrounding area doesn't support it). Don't look great either.
1,no había,"ustedes me dijeron que no tenian el libro,.¿que comentario quieren de lago que no me enviaron?"
4,"Okay for raw chicken, bones and all","I bought this grinder because I want to grind whole, raw chicken, bones and all, for cat food. It works okay for this, even though the directions clearly state, ""No bones."" For this purpose, use the largest of the three grinding sizes and work very slowly, alternating boney pieces with non-boney pieces. You can tell the grinder has to really work at those bones, so just give it time to do what you want it to."
4,Chop up your chicken wings,"We use this grinder primarily for grinding chicken wings, bones and all, for our border terrierIf cut into small pieces and fed slowly through grinder, it works well.If you use it for making hamburger you will have absolutely no problem at all. Its a breeze when we were making hamburger from different cuts of beef.I give it my seal of approval."
4,baywatch season 3,"This is in a season 3 box but it is not saeson 3 it is season 4 .I was going to buy season 4 after 3 so not that much of a problem but can not seem to find season 3 baywatch ,so if you are buying this to get season 3 do not buy it it is season 4 in a season 3 box"
2,Baywatch series,"I have seasons 1 and 2 and am waiting(and waiting...) for more in the series. Actually I`m waiting for seasons 5 and on, cause that`s when Yasmine Bleeth(!) enters the show(nothing 'fake' there!). The picture quality/resolution should be better too the more the series goes. Picture quality is really not the greatest on these early seasons. Not expecting HD of course, but this is like VHS quality."
1,"Season 3 on the box, season 4 DVDs","I ordered Season 3, and it says season 3 on the box but the episodes on the DVDs are all from season 4- very irritating!"
2,Badly done- replacement music spoils the show!,"The Amazon page makes it clear that this is actually season 4 instead of the 3 it's labeled as, which is annoying, but whatever. The major issue is the music.As is common for DVDs of shows from this era, getting the rights to the music they included involves a renegotiation and some new payments. Clearly, the powers-that-be decided it wasn't worth it, because they replaced most of the music, INCLUDING THE THEME SONG, with poorly chosen and not particularly good replacements that don't work with the (admittedly already weak) dramatic moments. It's extremely distracting, and makes a weak show even harder to watch- I got this for my boyfriend because he has fond memories of the show and a bunch of VHS tapes that I'd like to get rid of, and he couldn't make it through an episode.If you actually want to watch this, buy the German print, they love Hasslehoff enough that they've paid for the original music- they even have the American dialog as an option."
4,Pretty good!,"I have to say that I like being able to get Baywatch on dvd now!! I loved the show! The only problem I had with the dvds is the fact that you have to purchase all the seasons in order to get season 1. This is why it only gets 4 stars instead of 5. Other than that, I loved it. As far as the music, I really didn't care for it when the show was on tv, much less on dvd. I watched it for the plots and the dvd captured those!"
3,Baywatch season 3,I have always liked season three of baywatch for the reason that I always liked Matt and Summer together and this is the season that it happens. The stories are not bad at all. This is an enjoyable season to watch of baywatch.
3,Very basic,"Very basic book on keeping pigeons, I would pretty much label it a kids book. It has some useful information but not a lot."
1,misleading,"I ordered two of these tapes. The title says ""A"" end. I continue looking , to see what my other end options are. I couldn't find anything. So , I went by the picture , which shows the end I wanted. Turns out , the end in the picture is a ""B"" end. And the numbers start out about 6 inches from the end. In the picture , the numbers start out at the end. I looked on the back of the box. It very clearly shows a picture of both , the ""A"" and ""B"" ends. Why can't they do this on the web site. For misleading the public , I give them one star. I would have to say 4 stars for quality."
3,"A nice day-long read for ""cozy"" fans","I discovered this title by accident, but would recommend it to anyone who likes the ""cozy"" British-style of mystery story-telling. Doug Perkins, a frustrated PR man in 70s London, is trying to save his sinking PR firm by representing an American ""hillbilly"" singing/comedy act, Black Bart and the Troupe, abroad. He desperately needs their money to stay afloat, but along with the fees he must also bear the brunt of their constant criticism.Maw, the ultimate stage mother who makes ""Gypsy""'s Mama Rose seem retiring, insists on bringing her daughter to the forefront of the act, while Bart thinks he is the true star. Maw's ""accidental"" death stalls the troupe's UK debut, but when the show does go on Doug knows the star is also a killer.The mystery part -- who killed Maw -- is quite easy to solve, but the amusing narrative told from Doug's POV makes this easy to forgive."
4,could it be?,"She looks like a regular Barbie doll, which i love. she is so much better than the other ones in the collection !! Her hair is so thick and pretty! her make up....... wow. Shes very pretty actually! i usually dont like my scene even though im a barbie collector, but really... this doll is growing on me! shes actually very very pretty!!"
5,My Scene rock Bratz rock,"Look,both rock.You don`t like these dolls and if you don`t then don`t talk about it.Back to my review!Her face is very aisan pretty looking.She looks innapropriate but those are just pictures.I don`t own this.Her boots are cool.I like her blue furry thing and her skirt and nacklace.The shirt is cool but not the best.She comes with so much accesories I don`t even know what they are."
1,THIS DOLL SAYS INNAPROPRIATE ALL OVER IT!!!,"OMG I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS DOLL. I MEAN, THIS IS DEFINATLY THE DRESS THAT(...)WOULD WEAR, AND HER OTHER DRESS, IT BARELY CONECTS IN THE FRONT, AND SHOWS HER [chest]CRACK ALMOST. AND IT LOOKS LIKE SHE WEARING A BIKINI!! I AM NEVER GIVING THIS TO MY DAUGHTER, EVER!!! THIS IS DISGUSTING, GET BRATZ DOLLS, THEY TREAT BETTER LESSONS!!"
1,eww,oh my gosh my scene dolls are so ugly i feel like puking whenever i see them they are very inapporpriate peoples buy bratz they are pretty and fun to play with and they have coolio clothes
1,What now mattel video ho's?,"I'm sorry no as a matter of fact I am not sorry this doll looks like she can be in three six mafia video dancing in the background. Who told Mattel that this was a good idea? Is this Mattel's vein attempt to give the dolls an ""urban"" feel if Mattel feels this is appropriate to teach young girls to dress like ho's and teach them that their body is all that they have to offer then Mattel has some messed up views of the world. Honestly people this doll is not innocent looking it looks like it could be on that HBO documentary about hookers. What happened to the times when a kid could be a kid and play with a normal looking doll."
1,matell is trying too hard.,the bling-bling thing is not working. they look like they just walked out of a strip club. their trying to be like bratz by wearing short skirts and tops. I would give it 0 stars but amazon would only let give it a 1 star. this is NOT good for a six year old. should be 14 and up. thanks for readingG'dayjessica.
4,a bit disappointed,"I am a bit disappointed by this doll- she looks, tired, or stressed - or maybe it is an appropriate expression because she was in a smoky club and her eyes are irritated? I don't know, but maybe she'll grow on me. I am also mad because ONCE AGAIN the 2 dolls I ordered arrived with dented, banged up boxes (they pack paperbacks better than the dolls!)The fashions are great- the jewelry needs some work, too big and gaudy, un-necessary with the rest of her get-up. Her boots are a bit ugly too. Now I think I should have gotten Chelsea... but I do love her purple eyes even if they are a tad squinty, and the packaging has improved drastically- but is still not as good as Bratz, and I am primarily a Barbie collector. Wether you like Bratz or not- you can't deny they have brilliant packaging!"
3,Err... Bling Bling?,"Alrighty then... I'd understand clubbing or glitter and glam what not... but... BLING BLING?! C'mon now... The doll looks fine and all... props to all the -cringe- bling bling group.... I just personally think it was a poor choice in naming this particular series. And to think bling bling is actually in the dictionary... what is this world coming to. Well, enjoy your dolls..."
5,Gorgeous,"This Nolee doll reminds me of Angelina Jolie with her sexy eyes and pouty lips. I like the main outfit Nolee is wearing, but I like the second dress she comes with even more; I love the shiny sky blue color! The only thing I don't like about the doll is her boots! They look like galoshes (rain boots) and they don't look very stylish. I think the boots should be a lighter color and have some sparkles on them; they look too dull and drab for Nolee's bright outfits. But anyway, Nolee has a gorgeous face, one of the prettiest I've seen on the My Scene dolls (along with Bling Bling Chelsea)."
2,..........,"noope thats just a waste of money to burn the clothes, buy a different line. this line is DISGUSTING!!i now have a newfound respect for my scene. tho i will always be a Bratz LOVA!!!! :D hmmm... i wish i could design MY OWN doll, man a have alotta ideas. and they wouldnt dress like attention hogs either..~~** Long live Bratz~~**"
1,Ugh...,"While Nolee seems more on the appropriate side, look at her second dress. Uh-huh... Mattel has disappointed me and the My Scene gang hasn't had a really good line since Shopping Spree and Masquerade Madness. Jammin in Jamaica if you count the boys."
1,GREATES JOKE ON EARTH!!,HAHAHA!! THIS LINE OF MY SCENE DOLLS WAS MADE TO BE THE GREATEST JOKE ON EARTH!! TO ALL MY SCENE FANS WHO SADI BRATZ WERE SLUTTY SHALL SHUT THE F*CK UP AND EAT THEIR WORDS AND SEE WHO IS SLUTTIER NOW. BRATZ RULE MY SCENE DRULE!! MY SCENE SUCK 24/7!! AND ONE MORE THING.....THIS SHOULD SOO NOT BE CALLED BLING-BLING AND INSTEAD SHLD BE CALLED BLING YA A*S!! SO YA!
1,ugh,mattel is the worst brand ever. These dolls r so inappropriate! do not by these dolls the belong in casino dancing in las vegas!
4,A Good Read. Will inspire you to read all of her books!,"Although slow to get started, I really enjoyed this book. It was good, entertaining, and quick on the plot."
4,Good Trilogy,"My title says it all. The author is brilliant at creating alien worlds that are believable and coherent. She then sprinkles that world with interesting characters and sets up a confict situation or two or more. She creates as many heroes as she needs and they all behave heroically leading us to a satisfying resolution. I have enjoyed everything of hers that I have read. I devoured the Pern books. Thank you Anne, Lou"
1,Some good ideas poorly executed,"The whole concept of this series is exciting. What would it be like if humans were enslaved on another planet and had to start over with other races of aliens? It could have been an interesting book if it was better executed. Some readers like plot driven novels with excitement, mystery, and adventure. Some readers like novel that focus on the individual characters and their relationships. There is none of that in this book.-""Look there is a windstorm!""-""Yes, I see the storm.""-""Should we explore the caves now? We had better call a meeting about the storm.""-""Oh, I am pregnant and may have been raped.""-""Ok, what about the reflectors on the ship? When will the windstorm hit them?""-""I don't know. I'm hungry""-""Me too, let's eat then we can go to the windstorm meeting.""-""We are lovers. I think that is great. I will raise your baby""-""Thanks. What are you going to have for lunch?"""
3,A fairly average book.,"When I first read Freedom's Landing, I instantly fell in love with the book, comepletely hooked. I was overjoyed when McCaffrey finally wrote a sequal to it. I was in for a disappointment. The book lacks the originality of the first. It's a good book to read when one has some time and patience. I know I would have enjoyed this book more if I had never read the first book, so I can't really say there was anything wrong with it. The point is that it's a shame McCaffrey settled for mediocre when we all know she can reach excellance."
5,All RIght!!,"Thank you Ms. McCaffrey!! I just got my copy of Freedom's Choice and I just loved it. While some of the main characters from the other books made no more that token apperances, other new ones took their place. And the colonists managed all on their own to help and rescue many others found on the other colony worlds. I think that ms. McCaffrey did a wonderful job of showing just how everyone can work together, irreguardless of the species line. And in the time this book was set the species line was drawn not by what you looked like, but by what you could do. I like that, it says a lot about the potential for humanity. Lets hope that each of us can live a little of that ourselves. I'm trying to, how about you?"
3,Be prepared to read the book before and the book after...,"It's not that Freedom's Choice is a ""bad book""... it's just that, for this book to make sense, you really have to have read the prior book (Freedom's Landing), and, since the story continues, the book after.I like stand-alone books. Freedom's Choice is not one.In Freedom's Choice, the survivors/colonists dumped on the planet Botany by the Catteni work at developing a structured society, fight back against the Catteni (and their overlords, the Eosi), and try to uncover the identity of the ""Farmers,"" who have ""colonized"" the planet with machines for harvesting grains and meats (it is a bad thing to be captured during these meat-hunting expeditions... you get turned into sausage).Stll, Anne McCaffrey treats the reader to interesting social and personal dynamics. People are such entertaining creatures!"
3,"Great performance, but ...","The recording of the rite of Spring suffer there an there an unusual sound dubbing between takes that is clearly listenable ..Too bad because here is the mighty and beautiful performance, my own favorite, I hope someday the DG team will returns to the original masters and re edit this CD..."
2,Ok but not the best by far.,"I bought this for my classroom after having a Panasonic one for 10+ years. This one lasted for 18 days before breaking. It started off great and was an excellent choice, but for busy places it is not the best. It is a shame because I really thought this one would be an excellent buy, but I was wrong. Sharpener companies need to test their products in a busy classroom or office to really get an idea how they will stand up for the consumer. Surely this would last for the average person who only sharpens a few pencils a day. Kid tested and not teacher approved."
2,Electric Pencil Sharpener by Royal,"Sharpener works well for new pencils, but used pencils don't get very sharp. If pencil has not sharpened evenly, it comes out the same way when sharpened in this pencil sharpener. I was really disappointed in its performance."
2,A disappointment,"I purchased this pencil sharpener for my 3rd grade classroom after already having gone through 3 cheaper sharpeners this year. One of my students brought in this exact model for about a week between sharpeners, and I was amazed at how well it worked so I ordered one of my own for the class. It performed excellently for about 3 weeks--it quickly ans quietly sharpened pencils into very sharp points. After that, however, it took longer and longer to sharpen (you would have to move the pencil around and apply pressure to the pencil to get it to sharpen evenly) and the ""sharpen"" light no longer worked. It only lasted about two more weeks, and now it is completely broken. You can hear the motor when you put a pencil in, but the mechanism that turns to actually sharpen the pencil does not move. It wasn't worth the $50 I paid for it, and it's not worth the $30 it's currently listed for. Save yourself the frustration and find another sharpener."
1,Junk,"I bought this sharpener for my kids in school and within 3 months, it quick working. The motor runs when I put a pencil in, but doesn't sharpen! I can't find a number to call customer service... will be going with a more reputable brand next time. Very disappointed."
1,"Would not recommend, BROKEN","Bought this for home use, had it for less than one year, and it is broken. Therefore, I would not recommend this pencil sharpener. Only thing good about it was it's upright design. The area where you empty it appears large, but is actually very small, and you have to open it on top of the garbage, otherwise it spills all over the place. Sometimes, it will sharpen only one side of a pencil, and on the other side, the lead is still covered even though it's pointy. Main thing is that it broke after a year!!"
2,Less than expected,"Since the goal of pencil sharpeners ought to be sharp pencil, this model fails to perform. I am not a fan of the auto-shut off feature, especially on this model. The sharpener shuts off quickly, leaving a rounded pencil lead instead of a point."
1,HP a220n is still problematic,"Buyer beware. Our a220n has been under repair more than it's been functioning.Purchsed HP a220n from local big national electronics store for X-mas 2003. Out of the box it would not bootup so returned to the store where they replaced the hard drive (supposedly). Was OK for about 2 weeks and it failed again at bootup - ""hard drive not found"". Sent to HP in Cali for repair. They reformatted the HD. Good for about 2 weeks, then same error. Returned to HP again, they replaced hard drive this time. Now when it boots, the machine displays non-windows diagnostic pages that list a variety of disk errors. Works intermittently.Through all of this, the HP reps (including the ones from India) have been polite however they've been unable to diagnose the problem via phone. We're re-boxing the CPU one more time for return for repair.Who knows, maybe it's simply a bad internal cable or a CPU ... it's still under warrantee so I'm not digging into the CPU.Next time, I'm getting a Dell."
4,"Quickly Received, great service",I was extremely pleased with the speed of shipping/receiving this item. It was exactly what I ordered although I have recently found out I need the next addition that was recently published. I was very happy with how fast I received the order which was much sooner than what was projected. Thanks for great customer service so far!
1,Poorly written,"This book is poorly written, there are a number of typos, words spelled wrong etc. The CD that comes with it has the wrong formulas and the answer key is often incorrect. I had to buy this book for a class, if you don't have to buy it, don't waste your money!"
3,Right Up There,"The Killing Jar turned out to be a neat little ""B"" movie, complete with just the right amount of excitement, good acting, and suspense. It had me wondering all the way to the end. Lots of gore, if you are turned off by such things, but just right for me. The only flaw that I noticed is that at the end, they left some strings untied, such as did a couple of the guys who were very badly wounded actually die, or not. Otherwise, I enjoyed it, and I'm glad that I purchased it. My kind of flick!"
5,Riding with Harley,"He's done it again. William Harley has a great track record of putting out relationship books that are honest, insightful and useful. This one definitely fits the bill.For most couples falling in love is the easy part. Staying in love is a completely different matter. Harley dispenses his typical wisdom into the main reasons marriages fail and what you can do to keep the love ever present. No one needs to fall for the lie that love and passion can't be as present 20, 30 or 40 years into a marriage.Anyone seriously wanting to keep the romance and passion alive (or revived) in their relationship should definitely take a look at this book AND The RoMANtic's Guide - which I believe is the best tips and idea book to come out in my 30 years of marriage counseling. If every couple read and followed these two books, I'd be out of a job. Which would be a good thing.Dr. Bradley Sears, Spokane Washington"
2,cheap,"I ordered this a while back, we used it once and it was pretty much a bad idea. There are far better ways and better products than this."
2,you get what you pay for,"this mask is comfortable enough initially, but the so called ""love mask"" is not made to be worn for long periods of time. i took a nap w/it on and when i woke up the part of my face under the mask was covered w/sweat. its made of a kind of material that feels something like polyester."
2,"Beautiful, but disappointing.","Still wondering how some of these toys make the market...We received this as a gift. She is a lovely doll, but the water tattoo features do not work properly. We get the hair to change color perfectly, but the body art tatoos do not cooperate. We've used very icy water, and still, the body art appears for a few seconds then fades. Frustrating, annoying, glad I didn't spend my own money on it. But we still love the doll because she is beautifully designed, I just wish they would have spend more time working on this flaw."
3,Stacy's review,"I think that the new Mermadia collection has lost the quality since the first fairytopia collection. They look really cheesy and have lost thier beutiful ""mystic fairy"" look."
4,magical movement,"these exercises create a return of energy to vital centers. they are not difficult. don't be distracted by the practitioners on the tape. just learn the basic movements. do them at your own pace and let your body modify them if it wants to do so. done in the dark you will see or feel energy currents around you, especially around your hands. close your eyes and still see the energy flow. this tape covers just one chapter from the book of the same name."
2,Caveat Emptor,"Much of the advice in this book is incomplete, outdated, or misleading. After spending many hours attempting to use these forms to do my own divorce, I was tossed out of court by a rather displeased judge, and wound up hiring an attorney to re-do everything anyway. This might be a good reference for someone who is thinking about getting a divorce and curious about what the process is like and what is involved, but for actually using it to go to court by yourself, I can't recommend it. It caused me one heck of a headache."
5,Best Mozart Symphony Recording!,"I will admit I have not been a huge Mozart fan. (Please don't hate me!) I am not sure of the reason for this. However, this recording really won me over. Some may argue that Mr. Jacobs' readings are mannered but my take on them is that they are perfectly executed and highly expressive. I felt that I was hearing these works for the first time, although I am sure I have listened to other versions at least 100 times. I wish this conductor would record all the Mozart symphonies with this orchestra."
5,Great symphonies and a great recording,"This particular album was recommended by a newspaper reviewer, and he was right - this is a truly wonderful recording of two of the finest Mozart symphonies, the Prague and Jupiter."
3,"A very strange ""Jupiter""","Rene Jacobs has been celebrated for many of his recordings, especially Mozart operas. On this CD, the interpretation of Symphony No.41, The Jupiter symphony is unusual in its many tempo variations, something I have not encountered on other recordings of Mozart's final symphony. The same does not apply to Symphony No.38 which is quite fine. All in all I would stick with any of several other conductor's views of Symphony No.41."
1,mechanical and dull; totally uninspired,"If Gil Shaham's ""interpretation"" of Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto had been the first I had heard, I would never have developed my love for Tchaikovsky. I'd strongly suggest CDC 7 47106 2 (Itzhak Perlman/Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra."
4,Brilliant Soloist,"The Sibelius Violin Concerto is my favorite piece of music of all time. Gil Shaham gives the absolute best soloist interpretation that I have ever heard. It is pure genius. Unfortunately, the orchestration in this recording is a little weak. This concerto gives the orchestra a large voice and it is not well sung. The recording with the Berliner Philharmoniker has a much better orchestral performance. I recommend that one above all others as a cohesive piece of music.I also recommend that any true student of the violin purchase this recording for Shahams interpretation alone."
4,Not that bad,"Not inspiring. But what can you expect from such over-recorded works? Average, that's all. Now if you want to hear a good CD, try Shaham's recording of Prokofiev. Sibelius sounds better most of the time in a live recording or in performance anyway."
5,Love this book,"This is one of the best books Ihave in my library. It taught me loving,creative discipline. That made being a parent Sooo much easier. Every principle worked. Happy and amazed. Highly recommend"
2,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"I was very excited about buying this cd, however when I purchased it I was very disappointed. The best song is the song that is playing on the radio now."
2,Its not always better the 2nd time around,"This album doesn't hardly compare to his first release. A third of the songs sound like Michael Jackson music (very blah in comparison), the rest sounds like Prince (very far from the magic of Prince), the other third is just mediocre. The two stand out tracks are the duet w/ Jennifer Hudson...and Angel...Just download those two and save yourself some money."
3,ok,the cd was ok. it is not as good as the first one. if you are a fan of him i would say to get it. the shipping of it was great and the price i think should be lower because it is not worth that price.
3,Ne-Yo a step backward ?,"I think Ne-Yo's second effort is most likely a step back from his first effort . Where so sick, when your mad and sexy love really made me feel his music. I don't think this album was as strong a think because of you,go on girl where his best efforts and his duet with Jennifer Hudson was great the rest is kinda just there I think he needs to move away from only love songs and try some new things as he does'nt appear as versatile as say J.Holiday but he is several notches above Chris Brown I am also feel perhaps Ne-Yo is rushing his product out as soon he will have a 3rd album out he may need to step back as he may risk becoming over exposed . Ne-Yo is a very good vocalist along with a great songwriter but he must build to being a more complete artist ."
5,"""say it""","if ""say it"" were the ONLY song on the album, i still would've gotten my money's worth. i also love ""do you"", ""because of you"", and ""can we chill"". all in all i like about the same amount of songs on this album as i did on the other one."
4,One star short of 5...,"I loved his first album and became a complete fanatic! Since I figured he's been making all these great hits for other artists, his album should be a great hit! I heard each song throughly and aside the first single, the songs I like most from this album are ""Do You"" and ""Leaving Tonight"" with Jennifer Hudson. The one song I liked least was ""Sex With My Ex"", I found the vocals to be messy and the beats seemed to try to mimic Timberland's style. Not sure if that was the sound he was going for since ""Sexy Back"" for JT was a big hit, but no go for me. I guess I'll have to listen to this album a few more times before I become crazy about it. I'm sorry, Ne-yo, I love you to death and you're super cute, but I hope your next album throws me out of the park!"
3,good for what it is,"Hmm...almost all these songs sound the exact same. If you are looking for a cd just too chill too, then Neyo made this cd just for you... I must admit the track "" say it"" is super sexy, and may be added to a playlist of mine later.... but other than that , no other songs stand out. BUT... it is a nice cd."
5,TOP DOG,MY CD WAS IN PERFECT CONDITION. I REICEVED IT FASTER THAN I THOUGHT I WOULD. I WILL ORDER FROM HERE AGAIN
4,1st is betta,"It took me a while to allow the 2nd debut to seep thru. Finally, I can consider it 3 1/2-4. I still adore him as an infinite artist, using trendy capabilities to Prince, MJ, and Morrison. It's kool and satisfaction to me."
4,Because of You- Ne-Yo,"I liked this album from Ne-Yo. The title track, ""Crazy"" with Jay-Z, ""Can We Chill,"" ""Ain't Thinking About You"" and ""Angel"" will tempt you to dance with its fabulous beats while ""Do You,"" ""Leaving Tonight"" with Jennifer Hudson, and ""Make It Work"" deliver a more solemn tone. The final track, ""Go On Girl,"" is has a nice beat, presents lyrics about a broken relationship, and has a catchy chorus. The album received decent professional reviews and had 4 singles that had videos to go along with them. Ne-Yo received Grammy Award for Best Contemporary R&B Album as a result of ""Because of You"" (album). It also went to No. 1 on Billboard 200. Ne-Yo can sing."
3,Something's missing,"I think we all can agree Ne-Yo is a great writer, but that isn't enough. I felt all some of the tracks needed a super producer, to bring the lyrics to light. I felted kind of bored with the music, it was like okay, you are talking about some good stuff here, but the music is making me bored."
3,Better than most....but not enough!,"I am a fan of Ne-Yo because of the consistency of his ladt album. I mean, I named it R&B album of the year! However, whatever the reason, that focus is not there with this album. He has a few singles to make his way to Double Platinum again, but this being a ""album"" is disappointing. That's saying a lot from me who really connected to his last album. Production is the main plague to this record. I hate to admit it, but sales wise you will prosper. Content wise, you better come very good on the third album. If not you will be in the Omarion/Cris brown vein of mediocre hype."
2,Good as a feature.,"NEYO is good as a feature act with other artists, but not so sensational as a solo. Will listen again to see if I missed anything !"
5,Nice,Ne-Yo has always been one of my to rated rnb singers. I love him and the work he puts out. I waited a long time before getting the CD and I'm glad I bought it.
2,Hmmmmm.....?,"I like Ne-Yo. He has a great voice and is an even better songwriter. I bought his debut CD and thought that was pretty good so, naturally, I wanted to purchase 'Because Of You' when it came out as well.I am in a sense disappointed. How can someone write such amazing/number one hits for other artists (Beyonce's ""Irreplaceable"" & Rihanna's ""Unfaithful"" - just to name a few) and not be able to write songs like that for themselves?? The songs included on this release all have the same sound and tend to just blend together - making it quite a ""blah"" CD. Which in turn makes it very forgetable.There are a few ""ok"" songs on here but, none that are really worth running out and buying the CD for. I had high hopes for the song with him and Jennifer Hudson but that is even a snooze fest. He needs to write himself a big, smash hit that everyone will sing along to and remember."
2,Ne-yo Got the Sophmore blues bad!!!,"No matter how I try to like this CD, I can't. Ne-Yo's sophmore effort is just a little too short. I can't seem to understand how Ne-Yo is able to write the greatest songs for other artist but when it comes to himself, he just can't do it. I can't even say I like the first single off of the album. Neyo should stick to writing songs for other people because he's better at writing and hey, there;s more money in writing for other artists anyways.I do not recommend buying this album, best to just download."
1,No-No,What absolute trash. I expected something other than a weak michael jackson wannabe with all the hype surrounding the release of this. More swill to fill up the radio in between now and the next big thing.Total filler
1,I despise modern r & b/rap...,"and Ne-Yo is one reason why. I saw him ""sing"" the title song on the Today show this morning. He poorly lipsynched the tune to a pre-programmed track while doing a bad mid-80's MJ imitation. He had a ""band"" backing him. two keyboardists and a bassist that did nothing and a ""drummer"" that was playing hopelessly off the taped drum track. The ""song"" had no melody whatsoever with insipid lyrics such as this: Want to but I can't help it.I love the way it feels.This got me stuck between my fantasy and what is real.I need it when I want it.I want it when I don't.Tell myself I'd stop everyday,Knowing that I won'trappers can't write. without drum machines and samplers they'd be lost. but with a preposterous name like Ne-Yo, what can you expect. Somewhere Otis Redding is crying on the dock of the bay."
4,Criminal Minds Seasons 1-3 VERY NICE,"My order was received very quickly. The DVD's were shrink wrapped and so far only one cd has a glitch - it loads properly however, in order to play each episode I must open and close the dvd player after the previous one ends. I am very happy with this product and plan to purchase other seasons from this seller."
1,review,it would be better to buy these seperatley i got them at around 20 dollars a piece there is no way 3 seasons are worth that much it should be around 60.
5,Criminal Minds Season 1-4 review,"The packaging was very neat and well organized. Estimated delivery time was exact, good communication between costumer and merchant. DVDs were in excellent condition. I plan on purchasing more DVDS through Amazon."
1,not up to par,"Was excited to see new English mystery and with Diana Riggs, well when I put DVD in and started watching the excitement faded fast.There isnt any chemistry between the main characters and the story is hard to follow - I have read the books and they did not do the books any justice with this DVD"
2,Masterpiece Theatre Disappoints,A disappointing sequel to The Mrs. Bradley Mysteries - Speedy Death. The story lines themselves are good enough but no eye candy here. No gorgeous English castles/manors or inspiring costumes to feast your eyes on. Left me rather flat.
5,"If you liked the Edward Gorey Mystery! opening credits, you'll love this...",I watched the Speedy Death episode & fell in love with the series. Ended up buying the dvd set. The luxurious sets are off the charts AMAZING!: it's as if the famous Edward Gorey MYSTERY! opening credits were turned into a show. Every little detail from the makeup and jewelry to the music and clothes to the homes and countryside give way to the feel of the 1920's England. The acting is superb. Diana Rigg illuminates the screen & treats the viewer as someone in on the inside joke. There is evil lurking around the corner or in a haunted house or to a vaudeville stage or a girl's preppy boarding school. Strong scripts with a great supporting cast gives chills and suspense. Who are the suspects? Anyone from the flappers smoking their long cigarettes to the clown in the hall of mirrors....**Get the most bang for your buck and buy this particular set with the 4 episodes.
5,Mrs Bradley Mysteries,Mrs Bradley Mysteries - Death at the Opera/The Rising of the Moon/ Laurels are Poison/ The Worsted Viper (VHS)[and DVD] which I purchased was excellent and most enjoyable. I highly recommend.
5,SLIMEY DEATH/GRIND,IF YOU LIKE SLIME SLUGEY DEATH/GRID YOU WILL LOVE THIS.Limb from limb is a classic.
5,Brutal!,"If you want to hear the most brutal,heavy,gory music you have to buy this cd.I thought Cannibal Corpse was the most burtal band but when I heard this album my opinion changed.This guys are excellent.The music and the lyrics are very well done.This is one of best metal albums I have heard it is incredebly heavy and fast.If you like deathmetal you should buy this cd right now!"
1,Great if you don't need all 36 inches!,"This item is actually only 35 inches wide when received, so if you need 35 inches or less, this will do you. If not, you're out of luck like I was."
1,not to satisfied,the material is super flimsy and it didn't support the glass for the top of my aquarium.. how is this even possible.
1,This book is to complicated,"I didn't really enjoy this book; it was too complicated. After reading this book, I was frustrated and went online looking for a time table to tell me how long to wait between meals and I found an excellent chart that explained, what, when and how to combine and eat in a page and a half."
1,Velcro,"I had trouble adjusting all of the velcro straps and found that it wasn't comfortable enough to wear for more than 15-20 minutes. I had purchased this to wear while sitting at my computer, so the discomfort was a big issue. It may be better if you order a size larger than recommended..."
2,Sort of,It sort of held my shoulders back to good posture. The straps hurt my underarms that I could only wear it for about 15 min. (And I was wearing it over a long sleeve shirt). Planning to return it
3,"Works, but is uncomfortable.","It helps my back, and corrects my posture but after a few hours it will hurt my shoulder and is very uncomfortable in the armpit area."
2,Hurts to wear,"This does help correct posture, however, it is painful to wear. The product digs into my upper arms. It does help remind you to hold your shoulders back. Worn on outside of clothes I can see it working, but to be discreet under clothes it is painful on bare arms (I put it over a tank top as shown)."
3,So so,The product works as it says. It provides great support for your posture. The part that sucks is you must wear a full t-shirt to avoid the material from rubbing against your skin.
2,cause pain in the arm pit,"It made me more conscious of my posture because it restrain me from slouching my back, but it causes pain in the arm pit"
2,Posture Corrector,"Although the product did what it was supposed to do, it was very uncomfortable. It cut into the arm pits and the Velcro edges were rough. Wearing a T-shirt under it did not help enough to make me want to continue wearing it."
2,its worked o.k.....,"I bought this product because I have really bad Posture, It literally hurts for me to stand up straight, and I'm only 27 yikes.. So I was Really excited about getting a shoulder/back brace to help my posture. When I got it I put it on it felt ok at first, But then I wore it to work and I suffered for about 4hours and then i just had to take it off. The Straps that go under the arm pits were killer. They should attach a piece of Fleece or something to those straps, it might be more comfortable. I haven't tried to wear it agian yet. I even tried putting a shirt under it, it didnt work."
3,POSTURE REVIEW,"Mabis DMI Posture Corrector works. However, it is irritating where the velcro contacts the body. Need to put a piece of fabric so it doesn't chaff the body."
1,Fell Apart the First Day,"When I took it out of the package there were quite a few loose threads I noticed. Ater wearing it for about 5 hours I tried to adjust it and the seam at the back split open. Also, you cannot get the shoulder straps tight enough. The waist was almost too tight but the shoulder straps, at their maximum tighness, were WAY TOO loose."
3,Fits Weird,"Overall, it's a decent product. It seems to run small, as I used the measurement chart and got the correct size but it didn't fit. Also, if you have larger breast, this is going to be very uncomfortable. So, if you are shaped like the mannequin in the picture, then this is the product for you. If you are a bigger gal, like myself, then maybe not so much."
2,way too big,"I always slouch over, to the point that any adult will scold me to sit up straight. Bought this in hopes that it will sort of ""remind"" me to keep a straight posture. I think it will work for people who aren't extra small or small. I bought the small, and it was too big, to the point it just hung loose over my body. You can probably tailor it to fit, but I returned mine.If you fit mediums, get the small. If you're a small, this product won't do anything for you.If this fits you, it should help you maintain your posture, but just know that it won't do it for you."
2,Ouch,Rubbed and pinched armpits even over a shirt. Runs very small. Doesn't offer a lot of support but more a painful reminder to pull your shoulders back.
2,Could be better,The corrector cuts into your arms. No matter how far back your shoulders are it rubs and cuts into your arms. I don't think I would recommend this
3,Product is ok,"I believe this is to make you aware to pull your shoulders back. It somewhat digs into your underarm even with holding shoulders back, less painful when you wear a shirt underneath. I felt it ran somewhat big in size. Overall, I would not purchase this product, I would have preferred something that actually pulls your shoulders back."
2,impossible to wear,"It is impossible to wear this for more than 10 minutes! It rides and rolls under the breast but the worst thing is that it rubs under your arms. I bought the right size for my body so that's not the problem. I wouldn't buy something like this on line again. However, I shop Amazon LOTS and will continue."
4,Helps with Posture,Helps with posture tremendously and takes strain off low back while doing so. Great product; arrived quickly; smooth and easy transaction.
4,Works!,"This product really does help improve your posture. It reminds to to arch your back and to stand tall. I bought a small, and I have to tighten it a little tighter than the velcro allows for, but it's not a serious issue. For anyone who says that this hurts your arm pits, it only hurts when you're not standing straight enough! It serves as a reminder, not a miracle to cure laziness."
3,It works!,"My physical therapist suggested this product. It is adjustable for a perfect fit. I found that if I wear it for long periods of time, I need to wear an undershirt because it rubs my underarms after a while. It is soft and comfortable and provides the necessary pressure to remind you to correct your posture."
1,Better to just be aware of you posture.....,"My ""posture corrector"" lays still in the box which I recieved it in. Upon its first fitting I realized that not only was it unconventional to wear this under clothing, but it was simply not very effective! The shipper enclosed no return iformation, so I am stuck with this silly contraption. Better to disipline yourself to ""sit up straight"" and ""broaden your chest"""
3,great idea,"I bought this posture corrector because it looked to be the one that could most easily be worn under clothing. I can indeed wear it under clothes. It is made of a fairly thin elastic and i have worn it under scrubs, cotton t-shirts, and it isn't detectible. The reason I'm giving this product 3 stars is because although I understand the shape of it is purposeful, I find that the arm straps become uncomfortable after a short period of time, and you could easily start to develop chafing on the front of your shoulders from wearing it while active. I resolved that issue by wearing a T-shirt under the posture corrector."
5,I am very happy with this product,"I use it for working out on the treadmill because I had a minor neck injury, years ago and get neck pain, plus I have always had bad posture, I opened the box put this on and went online and ordered another one! I do no find it uncomfortable at all."
3,Pleased,"This product is really doing good. I see some improvement in my posture and back. I do need to wear and use it more though, which is my own fault. I would suggest it to others."
3,Back Brace,"i bought this item for a friend of mine. the product arrive on time with no problems. she tried it on but it was uncomfortable on her. she wants to return it back. the brace will rub the armpit area, leaving her with a rash."
4,A book about rural Tennessee that shows it in the raw,"No one is better at capturing the culture of an area in photos than a person who grew up there. In this photographic collection, Joe Clark captures the culture and people of rural Tennessee in the mid-sixties. Photos of people, buildings, livestock, fields, streams, and children at play all holistically come together to create a synopsis of the lives the people led in that area at that time. Clark also includes brief poetic captions describing what is happening in the photos. This is a book about rural Tennessee that shows it in the raw, just like Joe wants it to be."
5,"Insightful, witty analysis of the market and market players","Mr. Grant's analysis and insight into market inconsistencies, anomalies, and absurdities is refreshing in this age of me too financial journalism. The articles, taken from Grant's Interest Rate Observer, are as original in thought as they are uncompromising in their logic. I am a finance professional and feel that this book is a must read for any young entrant into the field. This perennial bear can teach even the most ardent bull to reflect before they leap. Beware if you've been nurtured on Money Magazine!"
2,Pocket reference comes up short,"I must say that there is some information in the reference that is pertainent to my needs. that is not to say that it does not suite someone else much more. For the most part, it was not really what I was looking for. The cost was right, the delivery swift, I have to credit the seller for that."
4,Not a bad product at all,"I thought this product was easy to use and produced decent results. It works better than some of the more expensive software; I have tried at least a half-dozen similar programs, but I keep returning to this bargain-bin favorite. For the money, it is an excellent value."
5,Good Buy,"Worked very well in my computer, even when newer products would not. Good product. Very user friendly."
3,Good but very techincal,"This book is good for the medium to advanced do it your selfer. It is a bit technical and doesn't offer any information on the ""small"" mechanical problems you will come across. As far as ""average"" info the owners manual section of the book is a better common guide. I would suggest you get this book but also have a copy of the Hanymes repair manual for the smaller problems."
2,Pushed Tempi!,"My biggest problem with this recording is really more a matter of taste then of any objective flaw. Abbado is consistently up tempo, which, in my opinion, does not allow the music to breathe, if you will. Just for the sake of comparison, Furtwängler's recording of the Vorspiel lasts 9:52, Abbado's lasts 8:24. The result is that it feels hurried and ineffective.On the other hand, Kurt Moll as Heinrich der Vogler is noble and divine, so if you like Moll as much as I do, then this recording is worth purchasing. Other noteworthy performances include Meir and Jerusalem in the title role.Bottom line: Abbado needs to quit collecting like he has a plane to catch!"
3,Almost really good.,"I love Prokofiev. But I hate Yank crap. It has spoiled a great compilation. It was beautiful, up until 'Peter and the Wolf', one of my favourite adventures. But then along came an American narrator explaining the story. Why is there this 'Disney' crap amidst some beautiful music? (All respects to Walt).'Lieutenant Kije' is one of the best stories produced by humanity of a man who did not exist throughout his birth, marriage and death. Don't let this piece of brilliance be swamped by crap.A good compilation, but I strongly suggest you go for untainted versions of Prokofiev.P.S. The Daleks will eventually conquer staircases. Be warned. Three oranges are not enough."
4,Fun Winter Toy,"My 2 year old and his 3 year old friend enjoy the tunnel. It is easy to see in; so you know what is going on in there. Very portable, folds easily and can be stored anywhere you can fit a large pizza box. It seems to be durable so far. We have not had it a year yet, but it has been hit with toy hammers and had toy cars dropped on it without tearing. Hopefully, this will be durable for many years. It is a nice change of pace for the kids when they get bored with the other toys. Especially when they are winter stir crazy."
3,Thanks,"The book was okay. I wasn't a very big fan of this book. I like a lot of Carla Kelly's books, but not so much this one."
5,Them,"...Infectious Hip Hop, well above the norm.This album is amazing and unique, and unable to be categorized.Them transcends people's perception of what Hip Hop is. Once the album's over, you'll find the songs have a looming presence, going over and over in your head. Thumpin Jel trax, Brilliant Dose rhymes."
4,Underrated and underappreciated,"Nat Stuckey is an original. I can remember seeing him on oneor more of the old Ralph Emery TV shows in the seventies andeighties. I didn't think much about him at the time, but havesince acquired some of his LPs and the two CDs he has now. Thefirst one, ""Pop A Top,"" had some really great songs on it as does this one. I'm not really too much on the novelty songs,but he did several of them. Nat and Connie Smith also did some great duets. ""Young Love"" is included on this CD. I would like to have seen more ballads on this collection, but it isstill a really good album and well worth the price. Thanks toAnn Stuckey, Nat's wife, for her part in releasing this music."
4,Great so far,It has been great the few times I have used it. I am holding final judgment until I see how the battery does. I have had trouble in the past with battery power on LED lights.
4,How the heck do you open it?,"I've been bery happy with the product.First complaint, there was absolutely no information or owners manual with the spotlight. Additionally, there is no indication on how to load the batteries anywhere on the light or the packaging. I know this must sound amusing, but who would expect that the whole back of the light would unthread? I was looking for latches, screws, etc. You'll see what I mean when you receive yours, and then you will also chuckle.Works great, and is very bright. Compares well to a 1M candle spot that I have. I've used it a few times now out on the ocean for spotting markers, bouys and debris at night. The LED light doesn't return as brightly off of reflective bouys as a full-spectrum white light, but the long duration and very tight beam make up for any limitations."
2,Doesn't Hold a Candle To It,"I bought this Energizer Spotlight as a gift for a professional friend.I wanted to keep the cost down and this light was 1/2 the cost of the Cyclops CYC-9WS.I'm always on the lookout for the next best thing in LED.This isn't it.I purchased a Cyclops CYC-9WS Thor-by-Sirius 9-Watt Rechargeable LED Spotlight last summer for myself.The Cyclops Thor-by-Sirius 9W rechargeable handheld spotlight features three 3-watt Luxeon high-power LEDs for long range and six standard Nichia LEDs for immediate area use. Three-hour burn time on high power. Cyclops has consistently been the leader in bringing newly engineered lighting instruments to the outdoor market.Now this light I love, The Energizer is wimpy compared to it.The Energizer model uses C throw away batteries, has only 1 LED bulb.The old saying you get what you pay for rules here.Do yourself a favor and spend a little more for the Cyclops."
2,Buyer Beware!,"Many of the pickling/canning recipes for vegetables do not mention hot water baths or other preventative measures against botulism. I had to learn this the hard way after a batch of pickled peppers quickly spoiled, fortunately no one had eaten them yet! The book also does not warn against the use of fresh herbs in flavored oils. Unless you know standard methods of -safe- pickling and infusing stick to the baked and non-canning recipes (those -are- good). The last thing you want to give as a gift is an upset stomach or worse!"
2,You can do better,"To echo another critic, this 2-CD set has a few good tracks, but mostly consists of bland electronica. On Disc 2, tracks 2, 3, 9, and 12 are exceptional - eloquently combining Brazilian/Latin beats and acid jazzy, electronic riffs. Those tracks almost justify the purchase of Disc 2 by itself. However, Disc 1 is pretty much completely unremarkable and it will collect dust on your shelf after one or two plays."
2,ok,"The song 'one more day' was actually originally done by otis redding-- this unlikely choice on an album by an emo rock guy works surprisingly well.Everyone keeps referring to this album as delicate and fragile, but what I've never seen anyone say is that he doesn't actually have that good a voice. It cracks and wavers and all manner of finding its way around a note. The production leaves his voice out there, naked, for you to hear all of the flaws, including a way that he sort of clicks his tongue or the sound of him opening his mouth that grates after a few listens. The songs that work the best are the ones that have his bandmate from rainer maria singin on.Having heaped all this criticism on this album, I will say that the guitar playing is lovely, and almost makes up for his voice."
3,Which Haycox wrote this book?,"This book has a copyright by Jill Marie Haycox in 1935 and 1936 with copyright renewed in 1963 by the same, the writing style seems to be so different from the other Haycox books that I have read which makes me believe that it was not written by Ernest Haycox. A story of a man seeking peace but winds up in the middle of a sheep and cattle war with the requisite beautiful rancher's daughter, I hope other Haycox fans will share their reviews so that I might see if they agree with mine."
5,The perfect soundtrack,"I bought this off Amazon.com used after seeing the movie. I thought the quirky music in the movie complemented the quirkiness of the central character in the movie, and because I'm all about the quirks, I got the soundtrack. Every track -- even the incidental music from The Greyboy Allstars -- is fantastic. Among my favorite tracks are Dan Bern's ""One Dance,"" with its great beat and charmingly plantive lyrics, and Mary Lou Lord's ""Some Jingle Jangle Morning."" My only beef: where's the song that Daryl Zero was singing on his bed? Oh, well, no use quibbling."
1,Mediocre at best,"I mistakenly purchased this Ben Broussard album instead of his second album. What a disappointment! Ben's voice is pleasant, but soooo lacking in dynamics. The songs are sort of pleasant, but none are what I'd call good songs. They are generally all boring. The songs are melodically just fair. Ben's lyrics are probably the strongest part of the album, but I wouldn't call them good. The lyrics are okay.The weakest part of the recordings is the musicianship and arrangements. The snare drum sounds terrible on a number of songs (tinny with a lot of reverb). Ben rhythm guitar playing sounds like he has barely learned to play the guitar. Very mediocre and predictable. The lead guitar player plays a lot of musically uninspiring licks and has lousy tone. Nothing to grab the listener from the bass player, either.Sorry, Ben. Better luck next time. And I am a Cleveland Indians fan, too! I have a lot of your baseball cards."
4,You CAN Teach Shakespeare to Young Children!,"Typically Shakespeare's writings are considered suitable for high school audiences. Those brave enough to try it with primary school audiences generally ""dumb it down"" by using abridged versions with simplified language. This, of course, defeats the purpose, as Shakespeare's genius is in his use of language, the plots being incidental. Fred Sedgewick makes ""real"" Shakespeare clear and exciting to understand and teach. He encourages the same kind of word play with his students as Shakespeare himself was famous for. This book is more than a manual to teach children to write and appreciate these great works, it is also a motivating book for teachers interested in adding a new aspect to their language arts classroom."
5,Sonic X,"Good cartoon, way better than the sonic underground series from the 90's.Anyway children will love watching it.S onic is still the fastest thing alive!"
2,Cover promised more than book provided,The inside of book was all b&w drawings - most of them belonged in the sword and biker mode than mermaids
5,Mermaids Vol. 2,"Great book and some beautiful artwork. Some of the drawings are really ""out there"", but then there are some gorgeous drawings of some breathtaking mermaids!"
1,Links wouldn't fit into slot,"All my previous watchs were already sized. I bought this so I can change my own links for the next watch. Well that day came, and this product let me down. I bought a citizen eco drive, and it didn't fit into any of the slots. What a waste of money. Live and learn from mistake and save yourself from owning a piece of plastic."
5,Positive Christian message!,"Easy to read. Clear, positive message promoting love, intimacy and closeness through sexuality in the context of marriage. Christian marriages should be vibrant. If yours is not then get help now! God created sexuality for your pleasure, dont miss out on it!"
4,2 become 1,"I am newly married and found this book a bit disappointing. It didn't include anything on STD's, infections, birth control or address problems that you may run into. Because of these missing pieces it is not a book I would refer back to and keep on my shelf. The book does give recommendations for other book that we have read and we found those more helpful. I would recommend ""intended for pleasure"" instead because it is more complete."
5,Great book on the heart of sex,"This isn't a manual, but a book on the heart of sex. It includes a neat way of looking at the sex act (Lovemaking Cycle) that is useful in helping spouses talk to each other about what does and doesn't work during lovemaking. The large question/answer section also gives interesting insight and help for common issues. Add this to a good manual (like Celebration of Sex) and you have a great reference library for any couple."
5,Truly becoming intimately one,"When Two Become One has become one of the most important touchstones for my wife and I as we struggle through our day to day life. The innovative ""Lovemaking Cycle"" helps us focus our attention on the parts of our life that create the underpinnings for a secure and happy marriage. We had a good marriage before we read this book...now we have a great marriage."
5,Awesome,I was completely enthralled by the depth of this masterpiece. This book is a real page-turner and I mean it. I sure hope that Brenna Mckaye writes at least a few more books about the land of Sablewood and the adventures of its inhabitants. I will be waiting....
1,Grape Super Chalk /:^(,"Purchased the box of grape super bubble... was tired of buying bags of super bubble and throwing away the greens. Over paid ($33.16) due to the way overpriced shipping. When it finally got here, was very excited to open the box of pure purple super bubble. However every piece I have chewed starts out as grape flavored chalk and after chewing for a few minutes the gum never turns into bubble gum... instead it falls apart in my mouth. End up spitting it out soon after. Gum must have been packaged in the 1980's and left in a warehouse somewhere until I unkowningly ordered online and am now stuck with a big box of grape flavored chalk... very unsatisfied. Would not recommend buying bubble gum from this online store!Signed - Grape Super Chalk"
1,Beyond Dreadful!!!!,"I blindly picked up this turkey (without knowing anything about it) from the used rack of a Blockbuster store several months ago. I brought the DVD home and proceeded to get information on it via the internet. Amazon was my first stop and I must admit to nearly crying after reading the terrible reviews of others who had already seen the film - I hate casting money to the wind!!! But, I decided to watch the film anyway and form my own opinion about its quality. Well, this has to be one of the worst scripted, worst edited, worst scored and most poorly acted horrors I've ever seen. Richard Chamberlain's acting was so bad that I couldn't help wonder if he had taken laxatives throughout the production and was overacting because he really, really had to get to a bathroom!! He was abyssmal!! I recommend you rent this dreadful film if you're really intent on seeing it. Please, please don't waste your money buying it."
1,THIS MOVIE IS AWFUL!,I rented this movie on .99 cents night and it wasn't worth it. It wasn't worth the drive to the video store. Ugh!
5,SHES BACK .....ONE OF THE BEST,TONI STILL HAS IT SHE IS ONE OF THE BEST FEMALE SINGERS OUT...IN A WORLD OF COPYCATS TONI STAYS ORIGINAL ...PICK THIS CD UP TODAY!!!!THIS IS A CLASSIC
3,Not Bad....But Not Great,"Toni has finally returned to the scene with a new label, new management and a new record. Was it worth the wait? Well, let's just say she's headed in the right direction after her disastrous release ""More Than A Woman"".The songs on ""Libra"" are fairly good and very well-produced. Toni has always been a producer's artist, so she needs direction in the studio to get a solid performance with her vocals. That's here, but there is no great single that makes her shine and really gets her back out there.She's experimenting with a less Babyfaced sound and a more funky R&B;, old school soul riff. She sounds enthusiastic, but has too much help in the background, which sometimes drowns out her vocals.Toni needs a pop hit to get back on top. Let's hope the next album delivers a hit.Close....but no cigar."
4,Toni returns,"I'm am very pleased to say that Toni is back on the scene and has returned to her roots. Unlike many other artist who have been out for some time now, Toni is able to mix the trendy music of today with timeless classics. There a nice mix of tracks on this cd, from catchy upbeat songs, to stripped down acoustic offerings. She sounds just a great as she always has especailly on ""Shadowless"". Welcome back Toni, this cd is a keeper."
5,stop hatin this album is the best,This album is hot and and toni braxton can sing. This album is full of hot tracks.My favorite tracks areMidnitePleaseStupid ( that's a hot track)Trippin
4,...Not sure what all the negative hype was about.,"When i saw reviews for this cd on music websites and magazines, the reviews seem to be suggest this is a sub par cd. I wasn't thrilled with the fact that the CD only had 10 songs, nor did I like the lead the single but i gave the CD a chance and found that i really liked it.Toni's voice is still flawless and she can sing the heck out of a ballad and hang with the fast pace beats. I feel bad that I ignored on this CD for so long.This cd could have easily sold much more if the right singles were picked and the CD was promoted better. Toni deserves much better than she got!My fav tracks on here are ""Take This Ring"", ""I Wanna Be Your Baby"", ""Stupid"" and ""Shadowkiss"""
3,Not bad but not the best,"I love Toni Braxton, I even have ""More Than A Woman"" and the remix collection, but I can't help but admit I was a little disappointed with this album. There are no stand out hits, although there are no bad songs either. ""Trippin'"" is definately Toni's version of ""We Belong Together,"" and ""Take This Ring"" is the album's ""1 Thing""/""Crazy In Love""/""Soldier""/""Get Right."" The album only has ten songs on it, there are no bonus tracks, as Amazon lists 12 songs. It's a little short, clocking in at barely 40 minutes. For a comeback album, I think this falls a little short. But I love Toni and I hope that she finds some success with this. Otherwise she's bound to go the way of Jody Watley, a once top-notch hitmaker who became completely irrelevant from one day to the next..."
2,Very Average at best,"Visually Toni Braxton keeps my Glasses Fogged up like I was on London or somewhere.Musically though:while Her Voice is still good the Music for the part is Over-produced.I don't hear no cuts that make me think back to Her Hey day between 92-96.I think she is kinda going through the Motions for the most part on this album.the Material has some moments,but I don't hear that Money Song.I think she hasn't been given the best Material to work with on a whole to me.but again Visually I stayed Glassy Eyed upon watching pictures.if the Album was half as Good as the Visual then she would be the Comeback Artist of the year besides Mariah Carey."
3,Toni... Ah... Where Are you?!,"First of all... I am a fan. Second of all.. I have ALL her albums. But, I was disappointed in this one. There are entire tracks that I skip - on a regular basis. It is hard to out-do her debut album and/or Secrets. There are a few hot ballads and - as always - a hot leading club track. In general, go get it... but no need to break your neck."
4,"WOW, Go sexy Toni","I like this album alot. She is very versatile on this album. I've always loved Toni. Every album of hers was good. My copy doesnt have 2 songs, but my favorite so far is Number #2.Good Toni. Keep it up"
2,This cd is in a moonring! Fever!,I will have to say this cd is so sexy (for the grown and sexy pepole) when Babyface came out with that album I think Toni is more adult till back in the days when she was a very nice female singer. But this album is not worth it for me sorry I gave it 2 stars!
3,LIBRA Toni,It doesn't compare to her earlier CD's. Its kinda Boring . I think I played it once since I bought it. Sorry Toni.
5,IT'S THIS IMPORT EDTION YOU WANT TO GET THAT HAS 4 (FOUR) SUPERIOR BONUS TRACKS THAT'S NOT ON THE U.S. EDITION,"I made the mistake in buying the 2005 U.S. Edition sometime ago, now don't get me wrong the U.S. Edition is still a good album album with Key Tracks: ""Please"", ""Take This Ring"" and ""Shadowless"", but a year later the ""Libra"" album was released in the U.K. that boosted 4 (Four) Bonus Tracks! ""Suddenly"", ""I Hate You"", ""Long Way Home"" and ""The Time Of Our Lives"" featuring II Divo. Surprisingly these Bonus Tracks took a good album and made it Great!!! Old die- hard fans who got hooked on Toni back in the day will really apreciate hearing these Bonus Tracks. You must understand Toni Braxton is moving in a different direction (Musically) on this album...Changed is good! On this Expanded Edition she makes EVERYBODY HAPPY! Who would ever think 4 (Four) songs could make a difference?"
3,Not her Best,"I have always been a big fan of toni, Ive always love how unique her voice was, and how she wasnt just the cookie cutter r&b singer that were constantly being cranked out in the early 90's. But I must sadly say that this albulm was very dissapointing. Toni tries to conform to the now when she simply doesnt have the voice or style for it. This albulm was the equivelent of seeing your 40 year old mother in a pair of juicy shorts and a truckers hat, just wrong. I believe she would have done better if she had stayed true to the old toni, The ""7 whole days"" Toni with just updated beats. While I do like ""Shadowless"" the rest of the albulm fell short. Sorry Toni, try again."
5,Shes back!,"thank you! She is back, Great CD, just too short, with gass prices the way they are she better go back and add some more songs. I must say it's solid no bad songs. they are all great songs. Toni, thanks for a Great CD, she sounds good, always looks good, and music is Great. much better than that last stuff she did (more than a woman) My favs are 'stupid' and 'Finally'. She should have just added more tracks, even if they where not that good, but a few remixed songs or something...lol Toni, gas is too high for you to be only putting 10 tracks on a CD. Good think i did not have to pay full price...lol Go Toni, GO ! with your fine azz"
5,one of the hottest albums of the year,"finally she s back, our favorite songbird, should you buy the album... you would be a fool not to. an RnB and soul classic, this album portrays the lovely braxton at her best... dont hesitate"
4,Solid...But Not Flawless,"This effort put out by Ms.Braxton was a solid album but the album was too short. Blackground could've not been cheap and throw in Toni's usually 12 tracks. None the less the best songs are the ballads. ""Take This Ring"" produced by Rich Harrison sounds like it belongs on an Amerie album. His stuff sounds pretty much the same and that doesn't fit Toni's signature style. The best cuts are ""Please"", ""Trippin"", ""Midnite"", ""Stupid"", and ""S'posed"". The album worth a listen. Good effort!"
3,Standard Toni...YAWN,"Toni Braxton has a most unusual voice. It's smoky yet 'beautifully fragile. It's hard to imagine what songwriterswould work well writing for her. There are some nice songson this cd, but it's not uniformly great. ""Please"" is justawful. ""Take This Ring"" is not really doesn't fit Toni'svoice. ""Shadowless"" is nice though. Maybe she should domore acoustic material next time. So for me, this cd is somewhat a mixed bag. It's great she still fighting the good fightthough."
3,Here we go again,"This album is better than More Than a Woman, which really isn't saying much. And that ""Take This Ring"" song produced by Rich Harrison--man, if I hear one more ""Crazy in Love""/""1 Thing""/""Get Right"" tune again from him, I'm gonna scream. Back to Toni though, she's alright but clearly her best days are behind her. The lack of album sales should show her that she should gracefully bow out and concentrate on her family."
3,Where's the Missing Tracks ???,"I just picked up Toni's CD, but there's only 10 songs that clock in at a limp 40 minutes. W.T.F. ????? Amazon originally listed 12 songs for 'Libra', and then I got this half-baked CD. F.Y.I., Target is offering an exclusive download if you buy 'Libra' from them, and the track ('I Hate You') is pretty cool. Of the 10 tracks, I enjoyed 'Please', 'Trippin', I Wanna Be', 'Stupid', 'and 'Finally'. 'Take This Ring' is PURE CRAP, and it has that same played out drumline percussive sound effect as Amerie ('1 Thing') & Beyonce ('Crazy In Love'). Vocally, Toni isn't 'bringing it' like her 1st 2 CDs, but Libra is MUCH BETTER than that dud titled 'More Than A Woman'. This 40 minute album (LOL!) may be a nice purchase for serious Toni fans, but it's also overpriced!! SERIOUSLY!! If you're gonna give us half a CD, then the price should reflect that decision. Don't spend too much money on this CD!"
2,Ooops!!!,"Give us our good old Toni back! This her new effort sounds like a sweaty remake of her worst tracks from all her previous albums. I am a most devoted fan of Toni and I have to admit I have all of those. I bought this one, however, just because of that sexy stomach of hers on the front cover. Is she pregnant? Then it explains why she sounds so exhausted on this album as well as its title..."
2,What is she saying?,"Was about to throw this CD out the window onto the Interstate until I got to cut #6. Finally, I can understand what Toni's saying. Sorry, girl, I gave you 2 stars only because I'm a die-hard fan, but next time print the lyrics on your jacket so we'll know what the heck you're saying."
4,Great music - not enough of it,"For all the waiting her fans have done just to get a new album and we only get 40 odd minutes???? The music is good and she's back on track. However the effort seems minor. Why for all the time betweeen cds, could she only come up short with 10 songs. Despite the lack in tracks, what is on here is great and her voice is better than ever. True fans will love it, the usuall critics will hate it, but I love it. I'd have given it one more star if the content called for it, but it is definately a must for all fans. I recommend this for sure."
2,Not Toni's best! Her earlier albums will always be the best,"Unfortunately, Toni's Libra album is very disappointing to me. I glad I check this out at my local library because this album is not worth the money. Last album More than a Woman was way worse than this. I wasn't feeling any of the songs. When she was with La Reid, Babyface and Diane Warren, that was Toni. This album is not the Toni Braxton I love during the early 90s when she sang songs from Another Sad love song to Unbreak my heart. She will always be a great singer, but sadly Toni isn't making big again like she used to be."
4,I BOUGHT THIS U.S. EDITION ONLY TO FIND OUT THERE IS A IMPORT VERSION THAT HAS 4 (FOUR) KILLER BONUS TRACKS!,"Don't get me wrong this is still a good album with the Key Cuts being ""Please"",""Take This Ring"" and ""Shadowless"", but it's the Bonus Tracks that are only found on the Import Edition of ""Libra"" that takes this album where it needs to go. This U.S. Edition focus more on her change in sound (Music-Wise)...Change is good, but you gotta have a little something for the die-hard fans."
2,Secrets...It is Not!,"I have every Toni B album that's ever been commercially released, and had been highly anticiapting this new cd for quite a while after hearing about her departure from Arista. So when it was available for import in London, i stormed down to the shops to buy what i thought would be a gem. I was not pleased to say the least, bland and generic, are the terms best used to describe the album. Please and trippin are the only decent tracks on the album, certainly even they cannot be compared to the gems on the Secrets album, which to this day still stands as one of my favourite albums of all time. So just like Usher who has yet to produce a new album to better 8701, Toni still has yet to better secrets or even the heat. Perhaps a return to older ballads is the key to her revival and more collaborations with Babyface."
4,toni is back!,"this is the toni that use to be, and she's back. love ballads that have substance... if you're a true toni fan, the one that melted over her first few CDs, you'll love this new one!ps...tonis christmas cd ...snowflakes of love is wow!"
5,What's Good?,"Libra is...actually this cd is one of Toni's best. It's more mellow as times now are more mellow for her. She's toned herself down a bit and shared a little more intimacy as well. Not to say that she was giving us too much to begin with but, Libra sits well with any of her previous reigning albums. Didn't think I was going to like this album when listening to it, but it grew on me and I haven't taken it out of my cd changer since it's release date.. Very Good CD Toni.."
2,Quit when your on top,"The old Toni use to sing very well, this Toni sounds like a drag queen her voice is too deep to the point you can bearly understand what she is saying and she if she was smart she would have went out with a bang when she was on top."
1,Toni what were you thinking?,"This album along with More Than A Woman are far less then average. You need to take whatever it was that Mariah had and take a hit of it, cause you're star quality is gone. Please would've been hot if it wasn't dropped in May with no video. Trippin is like Brandy's Saddid another song that has past it's prime. The only songs that even come close to average are 'Take This Ring' and that's because of it's beats. I have been a loyal Toni Braxton fan since Another Sad Love song, but Toni you should be doing Aida not trying to do the Beyoncee' thing. Sorry. I have loved your music, but you have continued to disappoint me since ""The Heat' Album."
2,"CD playback distorted, packing not secure","The CD arrived in a package that appeared to have been stapled, but was completely open when found in mailbox. Wonderful CD until the end when the playback became distorted. I emailed the sender; was a few days before getting a response that offered to either issue a refund for the CD or send an mp3 of the songs that didn't play. I chose a refund and sent another notice through Amazon so it would be done properly. Four days later I received the mailing label which requires that I pay postage. Seller offered no explanation for why it took so long to send responses."
3,"Best for Bag Work, ok for rest","Fundamentals Of Boxing/Advanced Punching Techniques were both good but it seems that he talked more than showed. I'm a Freddie Roach fan! He could combined both of these DVDs. 3 stars for the techniques explaned would be 5 if didn't talk so much.Punching Bag Training is 5 stars. Anyone wanting to learn how to hit the Heavy Bag,work the Double End and Speed bag, this is a very good DVD. He even covers some advanced technniques. I guess I expected more from a championship trainer."
4,"Over all, a good product.",I would have given this a 5 star rating but the information in it is too basic and the first 5 min are nearly the exac same in every video
4,Enjoyable,"As a romance novel, this was interesting, with well-drawn characters. The book is similler to a Georgette Heyer novel, altho somewhat less comedy of manners."
3,Mandrake The Magician,"Of all the comic book heroes translated to film in the form of serials, Mandrake is the most disappointing. He is ""out of uniform"" most of the time, does not wear the pecil thin moustache and any magic, cetainly not ""black"" as announced on the DVD cover, is not used to overcome the bad guys. Not once did he ""gusture hypnotically"" nor did he have a villain project his thoughts onto a wall. Worst of all, Lothar had a full head of hair.But, if as I do you like serials as a genre, it is a good example of the fare provided for boys and girls on Saturday afternoons 60 - 70 years ago.Mandrake the Magician"
1,works 1 out 5 times,"this thing works about every 5th time (which is how i know that i'm not just using things incorrectly). the other 4 times it seems to just not push the stem down no matter how hard i press it on the valve, or how i play around with the locknut. so it just reads 0 or some very low (e.g., 2psi) pressure."
2,May not be compatible with all presta tubes.,"I have had a similar experience to the reviewer who says it works one 1 out of 5 times. Except that I've tried it about 10 times on two different brands of Presta tubes and have never gotten a reading (although sometimes I do get the 2.0 PSI rating). I suspect that it is not compatible with all brands of Presta tubes, although it certainly should be! I gave it 2 stars instead of one because Slime's customer service department was VERY helpful. They offered to exchange/refund the gauge if Amazon wouldn't. I got a replacement from Amazon with the exact same issue...I am contacting an online bicycle parts store and they said it is a new item and are offering to take one off the shelf, try it out and tell me what they find. If anything useful surfaces I will report it here."
1,Completely worthless,"Quite simply, this product does not work. it will not accurately test tire pressure on a presta valve. I even carried it to my dealer to see if A) his tech guy could get it to work, and B) warn him to never purchase one. I am as disappointed with this product as I have ever been with a product. Especially since I paid extra shipping to get it sooner. Never, ever purchase this product. Unless you are a glutton for frustration."
1,useless,"This thing is useless. It doesn't work, I have tried it on my bike and car but nothing happens. Don't waste your money!!!"
2,Similar experience as others,"I'm also very disappointed in this gauge. I've found that the only way to get any type of reading (other than the 2psi) is to make sure that the head of the gauge pushes down the lock nut at the top of the valve when I push it down. Of course, this results in additional air escaping the tire.Don't purchase this item..."
2,Broke pretty quickly.,Worked pretty good at first. I was sorry to see it go so soon. It was only good for a few trips to the station to check tire pressure. The cheap green plastic around the tip broke and no longer formed a proper seal to measure pressure.
2,If it worked consistantly it would be 5 stars,"Hi,My name is Jon and I'm addicted to bikes. There, now that I admitted my problem I can heal. I have 5 bikes that use Presta valves (don't judge me). This pressure gauge works on some of the valves and on others it just lets the air out without giving me a pressure reading.Now I'm not a lazy dude...I've done some investigating. I've compared the valve stems on the valves that work to the valves that don't work and just can't find any differences. I've examined the gauge under bright lights and magnification and can't figure out why some valves work great and others not at all. Uninterestingly enough, I have a Slime Schrader valve pressure gauge for my cars. When I put my Presta to Schrader valve adaptor on the Presta valves my Schrader gauge works great. Whatever...If you buy it, it may work for you or it may not. Maybe you'll be able to figure out why."
4,Great country,"Rosanne crossed over to both the country and pop charts,just like her father Johnny Cash did.""Seven Year Ache"" is probably her most popular of them.She has a talent for defining things,and her style is truly classic.She could stand to ""up"" her pace a little,though."
5,Rosanne & I were pen pals in the 60's,"I never met Rosanne in person, but we were pen pals for several years. She was advertizing in a teen magazine for a Beattle fan club. I saw the ad & wrote to her. That is how we became pen pals. Her first letter to me, stated that her father was a singer & he had a song out called ""Ring of Fire"". She wanted to know if I had heard of him? To be honest, I didn't know of him at that time. (This was in the 60's, all this was happening). Her & I went on to write many letters between us. The last correspondence I had from her, was a Christmas card from Tennessee. I still have that card & all her letters. I have always wondered, if she ever remembered me & saved my letters to her? I know this isn't the site to say this, but hey you got to give it a chance, if you can. If you somehow read this Rosanne,maybe you will remember me & give me a holler. Last name was Nichols, in Spokane, Wa. The reason I am over here in Amazon, is to buy your CD for someone special."
1,Worst roller ever!!!,"This was my first time painting in the house and I bought this roller cover. It soaks good and covers well, but the worst part is that it leaves particles behind on the wall. When the paint dried, I could see so many *fabrics* from the roller were left on the wall that had dried up in the paint. I will have to do the whole wall again."
5,Great Songs,My son's love the songs and we play it every single day. They dance and jump around and have a great time singing.
4,IF THAT'S MOVIN' UP...,"I recently saw the incredible show ""Movin' Out"" here in Boston. This is the soundtrack from the original Broadway production, featuring Michael Cavanaugh on vocals and piano. He'ssmoother than Joel and does a fine job. As noted, the lively opening number ""It's Still Rock n'Roll to Me"" isn't on it, and a few familiar hits are medley-ized. But Billy Joel is such a great songwriter that this unique, dance-driven piece really works. (Most of the dancers I saw were the originals.) That said, I'd love to see a new CD (or DVD!) of ""Movin' Out"" with thevocalist I heard, Darren Holden. Darren's from Ireland but sings with real ""Lawn-Guy-Land"" soul- he's amazing! If I ever get to see Joel live, he'd better be as good as Darren. Meanwhile, if you loved the show or love Joel, this CD's still essential."
3,"Good, but not his best","Movin' Out is not the best Billy Joel album to buy, however it is good. I saw the show, and I must admit, the way it is performed is much better with Twyla Thwarp's choreography. If you are just using this to listen to Billy Joel's music, I would highly recommend choosing his greatest hits or one of his original albums. Movin' Out is great as it does include some of Billy Joel's classical music as ""William Joel,"" and there is no denying Michael Cavanaugh's incredible talent, however it will never compare to Billy Joel singing his own music on his own albums.I would recommend seeing the musical and appreciating it for it's artistic excellence that the album does not quite provide."
3,"""Movin' Out"" Leaves Out Too Much","I recently saw this show in New York City, and was impressed by the orchestrations (which won a Tony award), and, of course, by the athletic and endlessly inventive choreography (another Tony).The CD is good, but opts for shortened versions of many songs (am I wrong here?) that seemed longer in live performance. Hey, the orchestrations won a Tony! Let's hear them in their entirety. One spectacular number is omitted entirely from the CD, the Overture, ""It's Still Rock 'n' Roll to Me.""Having said this, however, the album still generates lots of heat when it needs to, and shows its gentler, lyrical side too."
2,Buy a Billy Joel album if you want to hear Billy Joel,"Its not a Billy Joel Album because there is no Billy Joel. Matt Cavanaugh tries his best, but he's only an imitator,Its not a Broadway Show because there is no discernible story, no matter how hard they pretend there is one.It is a dance show, but you can't see dancing on a cd.Buy a Billy Joel Greatest Hits album instead."
4,Almost perfect,"Saw the show at the Richard Rogers Theatre this past week, and about 4 songs into it I knew I'd have to have this CD. Twyla Tharp is a visionary genius, and the entire cast are fabulous dancers and actors. If you can get to it, go! I remember a lot of the music from their first incarnations, and I think Michael Cavanaugh is a better singer than Mr. Joel, who ensured that the band has plenty of kick by picking them himself. I enjoyed getting to hear and see the lesser-known ""Shameless"", which is a pivotal moment in the show. Like many show CDs, it's better to have seen the show before trying to give the CD a fair assessment. The only reason I didn't give the CD 5 stars is that ""New York State of Mind"" wasn't included."
4,GREAT CD! Great Broadway Show!,"I just saw this production 48 hours ago and cannot tell you how much I enjoyed it. The use of Billy Joel's music to convey a story was brilliant! I knew after hearing the music I just had to have the CD. My only complaint is that I wish is was more of a ""live version"". In the begining you hear the clapping of those at the Rodgers Theatre - but then the music appears to have been from a recording studio. That was my only disapointment as the opening musical number was much more alive when I saw it in person. Michael Cavanaugh is wonderful!"
3,Better than Joel,"I've never been a big Billy Joel fan, but I enjoy this CD, partly because Michael Cavanaugh's lead vocals are much better than Billy Joel's! Cavanaugh brings a fresh and much-needed energy to songs you've heard over and over again for years. The reworking of ""We Didn't Start the Fire"" flatters the song and bring the life of the show to the CD. A good purchase if you enjoy Billy Joel and would like to hear a new spin on the classics."
1,Movin' Out CD: Why?,"Who is this recording for? Surely not for Billy Joel fans, who would undoubtedly prefer Billy doing the actual singing. For that matter, why would anyone want to listen to 60+ minutes of Billy Joel covers? This is the most pointless cast album since Contact. Movin' Out is a similarly visual show the appeal of which lies not in Michael Cavanaugh's admittedly distinctive performance. It's no wonder you see used copies of Movin' Out is used records stores everywhere."
2,What???,"This album is simply a list of BJ's songs sung by an imatator. Michael Cavanaugh does have a great voice and could do a GREAT job on an album that has ORIGINAL tracks on it. He just didn't live up to BJ's originals. If you liked, or want, these songs on a CD, buy a greatest hits CD. Don't bother with this album, buy a BJ greatest hits and wait for a Michael Cavanaugh original CD. It really is the best way to go.I haven't seen the Broadway production yet, so maybe the songs are better on that."
2,"different, but not better","I ordered this for my wife when her belgian waffle maker died after 15 years of regular use. Since I prefer fruit and whipped cream on my waffles instead of syrup, I thought the ""boat"" style waffles this makes would be better for that purpose. While the boat does hold fruit better, the quality of the waffles produced is not as good as that from a good quality belgian waffle maker. The center of the boat tended to be soft and undercooked when the bottom and edges were done. After two weeks of the wife and kids complaining about the waffles this maker produces, my wife bought another belgian waffle maker from a big chain store. Breakfast is a happy time again, and this little novelty occupies shelf space in my garage alongside the breadmaker, waiting for a garage sale."
5,Villa Ware Waffle Iron,I love this waffle maker! Alton Brown from Food Network recommended this brand and I could not agree more. It cooks quickly and evenly and is super easy to clean. It takes only 1 and a half minutes to cook so you can feed lots of people quickly. It is an excellent product.
4,Good value,"Unit works good. Cooks a perfect waffle if you first spray with non-stick oil before each pour. ""Done"" signal low and hard to hear for us older folks."
5,My first Notebook,"I'm really in love with this Notebook, I've purchased this computer about 2 weeks ago and so far no problem at all, It's fast and reliable something I did'nt expect from a Notebook, I'm a very satisfied customer."
1,Mine just died...,"about two weeks after the warranty ended. I haven't figured out yet what I'm going to do with it :(. It got really hot often, the CD-RW would often give me errors when trying to burn CD's, but I haven't seen this coming :(. Maybe Compaqs are cheap for a reason."
4,This girl has potential...,"Kelly has a great voice and this album is short of about one or two good songs from taking it to that other level. But this album is very good and all the songs that are written by Walter Hawkins are excellent. He still has it. Kelly can only get better from here. ""Wait on the Lord"" gave us indication of that. I wouldn't discourage anyone from buying this album."
2,Grasping @ straws,"I bought this because I'm grasping at straws. I was diagnosed with CLL (leukemia) in the latter half of 2010. Everyone that cares had all sorts of remedies to recommend. This was one of them. It, along with the other homeopathic remedies has done nothing to arrest the condition. My counts continue to rise (into abnormal range). Will it work for you? Some swear by this product as helpful. My suggestion: Buy three bottles. Take the recommended dosage ""religiously"" on a daily basis until you have completely depleted the supply. Have monthly blood tests. If you notice an improvement, bravo. If you don't, then you are only out about $20. Is your life worth that? I hope so."
5,Conducted by Karajan:),"The Germans know Beethoven and Karajan has been conducting in Berlin since I was a kid.They are technically correct, disciplined and they just get it. Beethoven cannot be performed better"
5,great listning music,While I am on my computer I put on beethoven music for it is great listining music. It is great listining for me
3,Great 5th! Very disappointing 6th.,"This recording of the 5th is an absolute blast. I own Kleiber, Szell, Edlinger, and Giulini(with the L.A. Phil) versions and like them all. If I could only keep one it would be the Kleiber but Karajan's record sounds better and the reviewer who said he goes ""over the top"" in places is right, and it's alot of fun. The finale is just amazing. On the other hand, if this recording of the 6th were your first exposure to this masterpiece, you could potentially miss its beauty altogether. Karajan's first Berlin Philharmonic recording of this piece from '62 is sometimes criticized but is not that bad compared to this. Go with Karl Bohm and Bruno Walter."
4,"cheap, works great","plug and play installation on winxp. the fifth port is kind of useless because it's on the inside, but it's still cheaper than most of the four port pci cards. nice product."
2,DOA,"After a couple of E-mail exchanges with manufacturer's tech support, card was determined to be defective. Replaced by retailer with 5 port version (which was in stock). Card continues to work fine."
1,Faulty and Unacceptable,"The card appears to work upon initial installation.However, after hot restart, any device attached via the usb port(s) is dropped and usb port is disabled. A cold restart (without any device attached) is required to restore normal operation. Devices can be addad back (to usb ports) after a cold restart.Also, large file transfers (over 600K) to/from a usb attached drive appears to ""hang"" without possibility of clean recovery. A hard power down shutdown is only way out, but that leaves both drives in problem state (clusters involved in interrupted file transfer are left in limbo). Disk recovery utility (e.g.,Norton) is required to restore each drive back to normal."
4,A Winner,I bought this book to train my high school Scholars Bowl team. The depth and breadth of knowledge represented is excellent. It's particularly strong in the humanities and current events department.
5,"Hilarious! Right on target, regardless your ""Gen-"" (X,YorZ)","Baird strikes a chord which resonates with anyone who's ever worked a day in his/her life (which according to my wife means I should have hated it). But I loved it!Whether you work in a big corporate environment or growing entrepreneurial firm, this book's rapier-slashes at convention, office politics, drone-bee drudgery, relationships, and more, will have you rolling! I laughed out loud five times in the first two pages and didn't stop.This is Dilbert with a decidedly dry and edgy twist. Read, enjoy ... and don't spill your drink!"
3,same name,The only reason I bought this book was that one of the authors has exactly the same name as I do. The oddest reason I have ever had for buying a book!!
5,Can't get enough!,"I started eating these out of desperation when I was put on an anti-candida diet---no gluten, no sugar, no yeast, etc. I fell in love--they are and have been my gluten free go-to cracker ever since (though I got off the diet, I remained gluten and sugar free because I feel better that way.) My husband tried one or two and has never looked back--we go through them like water so we signed up for subscribe and save. We particularly like them with some goat cheese! It's hard to find a crunchy, rich tasting cracker when you're gluten free, but these really hit the mark!"
4,BACK TO MANDALAY - Dated but terrific,"Although I have been studying the China-Burma-India (CBI) Theater of WWII for nearly 10 years, this book was unknown to me until I recently saw a copy offered on eBay. I bought this via Amazon and I have been thrilled with it. Some of the facts have been revised since this was published in the early 1950's, but the overall story is correct and the personalquotes from those who were there for the air invasion of northern Burma are just fantastic. The story of the 1stAir Commando Group is a thriller right off the pages of the comic strips of that era, but it is all true.Lowell Thomas writes in his usual breezy style, which keeps you turning page after page waiting with anticipationfor what comes next.For anyone who wishes to know more about what was going on in the CBI while the rest of the worlds eyes werefastened on Europe and the Pacific this is a great read. RJA"
1,NOT a method for suicide,This book is more mental than actual. If u are searching for ways to actually die keep looking. It does help u prepare mentally I will say. After i read his method for death i ripped it up. The advertising is very misleading to those in a delicate state of mind.
3,Stupid with some funny moments,"Corny, but with funny moments. I didn't particularly care for the girl drinking the cat-milk scene which I thought wa s bit much, but hilarious at the same time. I did like the scene with pootie Tangs hit ""silent"" album. Silly but funny.Other than that...just a dumb comedy."
1,The dumbest movie in the history of cinema!,"I can't even think of words to describe how stupid this movie is. It's movies like this one that make me wish this rating system had negative stars, like minus five stars...or minus ten stars."
1,"If you're running short on money, don't waste it on this!","Bad, Bad, Bad! I'd rather see a 5 hour Teletubie movie then see Pootie Tang. It was the STUPIDEST, DUMBEST, MOST RETARDED movie ever in the history of Hollywood. I can't believe it made it to the theaters. It's God awful. Don't bother to see it!!! Trust me!"
2,Pootie Tang is horrible!!!!!!!,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen! I mean, how can you have a superhero with a belt as a weapon?! And how can his weakness be women? This is a very stupid movie!!! Do not buy this movie!!! It has a very bad script, the language is understandable, and it's only funny the first time you see it but when you watch it again, it's like ""What was I laughing at?"" DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!!!"
1,I'm the 22nd reviewer with a brain,"The 59 reviewers who gave this movie 5 stars need to be institutionalized. That is not hyperbole.In fact, institutionalize the 20 who gave it 4 stars. For those who gave it 3 stars, I'll give you the benfit of the doubt and assume you had just smoked an ounce of powerful weed or taken some potent LSD before viewing, because watching this movie is agony.The most the audiece lauged was 30 minutes into the film, when I leaned over to my friend and said (quite loudly) ""this is the worst movie I've ever seen"".Verdict:If I was sentenced to be locked in a prison room for a year with this playing over and over, I'd kill myself after a month.BTW, over at IMDB, this movie gets 4 out of 10 which is still 3 too many"
2,I tried to like this...,"this movie didn't start out too bad. i thought it would be one of those stupid, but fun movies. i was wrong. while pootie tang is a loveable character, you won't be missing much by passing this movie over. i found myself wishing the movie would end sooner. check this out only if you want to REALLY waste about an hour and a half. on the other hand, chris rock is pretty funny in this movie, as always. check out down to earth if you want chris rock though."
2,drinking game..,"let me first say this movie as a whole or ""as a movie"" stinks.. the supporting cast is ok in a few spots but otherwise this movie stinks as a movie... with that said, this movie Rocks as a drinking game !! Its simple, anytime ""pootie-tang"" is said in this movie you take a drink.. and believe me they are numerous.. its been many , many years ago that we done this but the memory of this movie and drinking games lives on.."
3,Almost as good as Zoolander!,The script could have been a little better -- but this was pretty funny! I especially liked the shotgun marriage scene!
2,What Happened Chris??,This could have been a really funny cult movie but the script wasn't very good. A talented cast with not much to work with.The Pootie Tang segments from Chris Rock's show were hilarious though. They should have took more time in the writing stage. There were a few real funny moments but overall the film is kinda silly
5,No gray area with this one,"Pootie Tang is one of the funniest most original movies to be released in the last twenty years. It is the very definition of a cult classic--misunderstood, hated, loved, and in possession of a devout group of followers. The humor in this movie is absurdity at it's best, and the experience of watching it with people who love it may be a little jarring. If everyone around you is laughing at Pootie's legendary vocabulary, you might start to think that the words have meaning, and in fact, they do. It is post modern, it is deconstructionist, it is academic. Well, maybe not, but it's as funny a movie as you'll ever see. It's nothing if not original."
5,Black Entertainment,"This movie is a comedy ""keeper."" It is full of black-sterotypical (but funny) action that can be laughed at and not taken as truly offensive. I liked it. Suggestive scenes are in the movie so parental advice might be a good idea. This movie is getting harder to find also. Lance Crouther (who plays Pootie)has come a long way since making this movie. All in all, this movie is entertaining."
3,Sep-a-tah,"Pootie's ""cool"" language was the one thing that made me kind of drawn to this movie. Originally my friend begged me to watch it with her. I usually never watch so-called stupid movies, but I gave it a chance. The names and characters in this movie were so hilarious, for instance ""Biggie Shorty"" and her line (which was my favorite in the movie) ""Just because I am dancing on a street corner, next to a bunch of hookers, wearing fishnet, don't mean I'm hookin!"" At first glance you will probably think this is a stupid movie, but then once it gets going you have a few good chuckles. I have to say that Chris Rock is an excellent creative comic, and all of his movies have great humor, that you just have to appreciate. I do recommend this movie to almost anybody, unless you are way to serious to see the dumb side of life on occasions."
1,the worst,"hey i saw this movie in the dollar theatre, and you know what? that dollar would have been alot better spent on a cup of coffee."
1,This movie is horrible!!,"I would have to say that this is the worst movie I've seen in a long time. Worse than Supernova or Lost Souls, this movie's lack of a real plot is dead weight to this movie. The pie scene was the worst and aside from Chris Rock's friend that always repeated what he said, this movie couldn't warrant a chuckle. You keep watching hoping that it forms some kind reason to watch or say it wasn't bad, but it never happens."
2,10 minutes of genius and 75 minutes of (crud),"this film falls under the category of ""tons of potential but the finished product is severely lacking"". the writing shows glimpses of brilliance but the majority of the humour is anything but funny and the cinematography in this film is abominable. i've never seen worse shot composition in a feature length film. if you can look past what's bad about 'pootie tang' you'll enjoy it."
2,"Not a good movie, not even when ur high","I watched this movie twice, once when I was high. For a movie that is supposed to be hilarious, I didn't find it that funny either time. My friends and I had to stop it halfway through each time because we were completely bored, although I found ""Whatatah"" somewhat funny. Other than that, this was one of THE dumbest movies out there to be watched. Stay away from this movie!"
2,Silly old movie,"Wanted to watch it since its been so long, it was too over the top. Avoid it like the plague or watch only if you have the munchies lol."
4,Instant cult classic!,"if you like your humour zany and crazy this is the movie for you. an instant cult classic. lance, chris and wanda keep youlaughing. get it just to see wanda sykes play 'biggie shorty'.r-s"
5,This movie should have been huge!,"Outstanding! One of the best comedies of the year, if not ever! While it is slap stick humor, it is very well done and intelligent. I cannot recommend it enough! This movie should have been a major hit. It is destined to be a cult classic."
1,First runner up- What's the Worst that Could Happen?.,"...Chris Rock's ... ""Pootie Tang"" is the worst movie of the summer being it had no real plot, or acting, or humor. ... The title of the film explains what the movie, itself, is. Without going any further, let's just say that this film is probably one of the dumbest movies in a long time! Don't waste your money, or your valuable time!"
2,"Stupid Can be Funny, but not this time!","this movie is stupid. you cant argue w/ that, it's stupid on purpose 2 try 2 b funny. the problem is it's way too stupid 2 b funny, i mean there are some funny parts (my favorite is the pie scene) but it's just not that funny. If u like 2 laugh at stupid [stuff] then go see zoolander, the funniest stupid movie ever."
1,Yuck,"I did not like this movie at all. I originally bought it for my teenage kids, who generally enjoy these type of flicks, and they didn't like it either. The made up language Pootie Tang speaks is ridiculous as is the silly actions scenes with his belt. The only good thing about the movie was the multiple characters Chris Rock played and of course Wanda Sykes.I strongly recommend you not buy this movie."
1,Garbage suitable for the dumb masses,"Do not see this movie. Actually, it's your money, and if you live in a free country go ahead and waste it on ""Pootie Tang"". I'd rather watch my own execution."
1,Modern Day Minstrel Show,"Pootie Tang is one of the most steryotypical minstrel movies in existance. Pootie tang, the main character, speaks in ebonics (he's too dumb to speak English, apparently) and he fights using a stupid magical belt. His great rap song that has no words or music, just silence, is almost the director saying that black people will listen to anything and call it music. This movie is deeply offensive and shallow in nature. Buy a copy, and then go stomp on it."
1,??,"I'm a bit confused. The DVD won't play in my DVD player, Playstation 3, OR my laptop. When I put it in the laptop, it prompts me to select a language( out of 23 different languages). After that, it rejects the disc. In the PS3 and DVD player, it just rejects the disc. What is this disc I have received?"
3,not sure about it,"it's alright, but i need to really sit and watch it closer, i don't fully understand the point of this movie."
2,Dumb and not that funny,"I expected more from Louis CK, but this movie was a waste of time. I like dumb movies like ""Tommy Boy"" and ""Zoolander,"" but ""Pootie Tang"" just wasn't very funny."
4,Fun-nay!,"Pootie tang is the penultimate ladies man. You will laugh, you will cry... But seriously, you will enjoy it. Wadatah to da shamacow!"
3,Pootie Tang,"I wanna be as cool as Pootie!Just watch it for what it's worth. A great cast, fun and playful. Has the feel of being shot with your home movie camera with high school credits at stake but who cares. Characters are witty and you find yourself soon after repeating lines to show off your "" cool "".Don't worry if you can't speak Pootie........."
4,hilarious,"my b/f introduced me to this movie....it's surprisingly funnyGood shipping time, the case was a little damaged when I received it, but that's ok - it wasn't listed as a new product - and the DVD works, which is all that really matters. Overall happy with my experience."
5,Loved it!,I bought the Pootie Tang movie for my husband for his birthday because he had previously owned the movie and lost it. It is a hilarious movie! He watched it over and over all day long the first day he got it. I would say this is my husbands favorite movie of all time.
3,No Extras,I love this movie but this dvd is low budget. The only extras are: the music video and the trailer. Enjoy.
5,Cante flamenco at its purest,"This great flamenco singer takes center stage in this live recording of cante jondo with his emotional and raw voice dripping with duende, to the delight of his listeners. The CD has only six tracks but they are all extended play and Agujetas is accompanied by Moraito, one of the best flamenco guitarists of his generation. A highlight here is the 17 minute martinete, a song that has no guitar accompaniment, and in which Agujetas is at his very best as he expresses the letras of one of his favorite cantes. The music is a great experience and a great example of what cante jondo really is."
4,great rental,"I don't understand the disappointed reviewers here. A little research at Amazon or IMDb would have revealed this may arguably be termed an ""art film"", but it certainly isn't lesbian porn, and why in the world would anyone purchase something they knew nothing about when they could easily rent it from Netflix or Blockbuster online? No, it's not in the same league as Aimee & Jaguar, but Jeannette Hain is fun to watch, the settings are gorgeous, and there's also some interesting music (that's what led me to this page - looking for a soundtrack listing). If you like travel stories and aren't left cold by subtlety, give this a try. Oh - the particular tune in question was ""Hindou,"" and you can hear it on The Lecuona Cuban Boys, Vol. 5 (1932-1940) Enjoy."
5,Truth in a photograph,"A true story from more than sixty years ago, yet it could have happened yesterday in much the same part of the globe. Slow, melodic, and like a day dream, no one denies the exquisite erotic tension that exists here. Neither can it be denied that this perfume is found in a patriarchal world of imminent violence. In one extraordinary scene after another, where communication cannot be had by the exchange of words, a rapport is obtained between the inhabitants of this world despite the inexorable progress to war."
2,Journey to WHERE?,"We went out on a limb buy ordering this movie without anyone we knew ever seeing it. We did the same when we purchased ""Amiee & Jaguar"". A & J was a wonderful foreign film! This one unfortunately was not. Through the whole movie we were awaiting something...anything of excitement to happen - nothing ever did. The scenery was ok but not fantastic and definitely not cool enough to overshadow the boring script.We say DON'T BUY with this one. Borrow it from someone else who was brave enough to buy it and save your $20!"
1,Journey to where?,"I hated this movie...I don't think I can come up with anything nice to say at the moment about this it. It was slow...boring...and well...odd. Unfortunately we purchased this movie, so now we're stuck with it! :("
5,retro smooth-funky-jazzy spun together by the magic that is Jazzanova,"Wow, what a collection. I bought this sort of on a dare - since I tend to love all the Jazzanova stuff - and found it just get's better the more I listen to it. Some of the ""smashed stuff"" I just could never listen too, but I did rip 16 wonderful tracks to my iPod and these are just fabulous.The flow from Betty Carter's smooth retro ""Open the Door"" into jazzy, into funky, into really funky Dayton's ""The Sound of Music"" finally mellows back down into a smooth and delectable ""For you and I"", from the scrambled side; and I kept six of these funky-jazzy and all mixed up, well smashed up, fun tracks.I love lounge - and all the blues, tango, piano, sax, reggae... type of influences - but it can be quite a challenge to get exciting variety. I rate this one of my top 3."
2,WRC fan?,This maybe the only way one can watch coverage of the WRC. Too bad one has to buy the series piecemeal rather than having the series available on one DVD. Guess that means bigger profits for the producer! Which aslo becomes difficult to track which events are covered and which ones aren't.
3,A little on the lower side of the spectrum,"So I was really disapointed in the barbie movie for the amount of negative content in it, and could not show it to my children. There are way too many close butt shots of Barbie through out this film while she is walking and daydreaming. Also though the film shows gossip in a NEGATIVE light younger children could pick up alot of gossiping from watching this film I think. I also did not appriciate that barbie's boyfriend in the film was Kevin rather than Ken which would have followed Barbie's other movies better. I did not like the football jock at all and think the film would have done well to leave him out completely. I did however like the over all story plot, and recently discovered Disney's 'Geek Charming' which REALLY was a charming movie with a similiar plot but much cleaner and sweeter than this barbie film."
1,Pretty Bad,"The animation wasn't very good, and the whole plot just proves how desperate the Barbie company is. The Barbie company is obviously scared by the threat of the Bratz dolls, so they tried to make a ""cool teen"" movie.IN reality, Barbie is for three year olds, and the themes of the movies are just too adult for three year olds. Tweens are what this movie is appropiate for, and what self respecting teen would watch a Barbie movie?The movie is about Barbie whining about being unpopular, and wishing that an (ugly) ""Mr. Hotty will recognize her and be her boyfriend. H3er ""so clever"" scheme for popularity is to make her band play BAD songs at the fall formail. A total must see. NOT!"
3,Decent,"The plot of this movie was entirely cliche, though it would appeal to preteens whose current obsessions include boys, bands, and popularity. Maybe a couple of seven year old girls would be interested, I don't know, though I do know I wouldn't have been interested in half of the content when I was seven. The themes stressed were mostly good, but still not something I would want my daughter to bother over. Nothing about it was really anything imaginative (no talking animals). The whole deal with the magical diary was really all in the plot that set it apart from a dumbed down Mean Girls mixed with other high school flicks and that part was actually negligible. The story could have done just as well without it. But it was still an engaging story for all that it was too predictable to do anything for anyone over the age of seven and and too old for anyone younger than ten."
1,Completely Unacceptable,"This movie is inappropriate for young children (under 8)for whom the other Barbie Princess movies were the target audience. We received as a gift and I'm sure the giver thought this movie would be in line with the others. It is not due to very inappropriate messages: 1) If your make-up gets confiscated, keep extra hidden in the pocket of your coat. 2) Getting boys to like you is most important in High School. 3) Getting boys to kiss you is even more important. 4) Getting good grades will make everyone hate you. These things may happen in high school, but this isn't an appropriate message for 5 year olds.Shame on Barbie, shame on Mattel!"
2,Dissapointing,"When I got this DVD I thought it was going to be really good and I was really happy. But when I saw it, I was really Dissapointed.It is a just like Mean Girls! A Girl Hanging out with the popular girls for like a experiment (or in this case a Study).The only thing that I liked about this Movie was the Songs. The Songs are really good, If they have a soundtrack I want it :) Apart from that, this movie wasn't very good.Oh and PS. Unlike the other Barbie Movies, this movie isn't really for like really young girls."
2,Based on the previews,"I think the subject matter is a bit grown up for the younger girls. Its more suited perhaps to the tweens, who wont watch it anyway. I liked Mermaidia, it had strong female characters. I hope Barbie learns in the Diary movie there is much more to life then boys and popularity!"
1,not good!,"story line: not for young kids, and not even really good for older kids. she has to try to fit in with the cool kids. whatever. i hate that an animated kid movie took on the teenage ideals of teenage movies. (!!!!!)animation: sucks. was expecting every other barbie movie animation. those look amazing, this was verrrrrry poor."
1,role model??,"Though I have not viewed it, I've seen the ""preview"". No offense, but it totally is NOT a positive influence. Barbie says, ""I need to find a way to approach the popular crowd."" So she's basically saying, oh I have to be popular. This is basically another Mean Girls-esque movie just with Barbie. Role model? Yeah right. Yes, let's all be blonde cronies and rule the world being popular! Frankly, I'm a bit miffed because there are never Asians. They're all blonde, brunettes...hello? Barbie is racist and such a stupid vision of ""beauty"" - thanks to Barbie, people are bulimic. Thank you so much you blonde idiot."
3,Not very entertaining,"My daughter (7.5) wasn't all impressed by this .. she didnt find it as enertaining or fun as other Barbie movies especially her favourite ""charm school"" .."
4,The kids like this movie,"The girls like this video, it actually has a good message about friendship, but I will warn you that my girls wanted to form a rock band in the garage once they'd seen it a few times. Luckily we don't have an actual garage."
1,Not for young children!,"Warning to Moms of young children. I let my 4 year watch this movie. She adores it and I did not think I had anything to worry about with it until she started saying ""I Hate My Life"". When I asked her where she learned to say that and she said from the Barbie movie. Sure enough, that's what Barbie says in it. I am shocked phrases like this were in a Barbie movie and I am very disappointed"
2,Not up to standard,"The animation is jerky, Barbie looks odd and nothing like herself. She's portrayed as a highschool student, but acts like a middelschool student. Poorly written, poorly animated. My 8 year old daughter loves Barbie movies, and she asked me if we could send this one back."
3,Mediocre Barbie DVD,"My daughter loves the Barbie DVD's, this one included, but I definitely think it's aimed towards an older audience than my 4 year old daughter. That being said, she still highly enjoyed it (I think mostly because of the music) and it was worth every penny to see the smile on her face when she watched it. I was disappointed by the graphics on it though. The other Barbie movies appear to be made better than this one as far as the graphics go."
3,Barbie Diaries,shows those avid barbie fans that growing up is sometimes hard but that things work out when you believe in yourself
5,Fabulous!,"While I can't believe that Mary has created two beautiful daughters with the sleazy likes of James Carville, I was able to get a copy of this book, and it really touched my heart. The book has lots of great ideas for mothers."
1,matalin cannot be trusted,"Mary Matalin has been supporting the publications of people like Jerome Corsi. Any statements that she makes should be taken with extreme care and checked before being accepted. It is likely that what she says about herself and her daughters is also distorted, and likely in a way favorable to herself."
5,An Excellent and Deeply Moving Performance,"Admittedly, I have not heard any of the other recordings of this work, so I have nothing with which to compare it to; that aside, this work - text, performance, and all - instantly resonated with me.I am biased towards requiems - they are one particular type of work that I seek and collect, and that's how I stumbled across this. The ""Dies irae"" - always a critical point in a requiem - is quite powerful, and remains the most memorable part of this work.The narration is a bit overly dramatic at times, something that would usually detract from the work for me (especially in a requiem) but here it works quite well. There is a lot of feeling and meaning brought into this work through Britten's own experiences with war - this is decidedly an anti-war piece, and the booklet provides plenty of background, although the narration (excerpts from a poem, I believe) is clear and easy to follow, mingled in with the text of the traditional Latin mass."
3,Way down on the list,"Nothing here is all that good--the sound is skimpy and wiry, the provincial German forces have no idea of Britten style, and Gardiner himself doesn't hold a candle to Britten, Giulini, Rattle and other greater condcutors doing this masterpiece. A miss al around."
1,Hate It,"I bought this thinking it would be a good alternative to the mechanical boxes, but not so. I haven't had the litter leakage that others here have, but when the cats pee on the grate with clumping litter inside, the litter is stuck and clumped on the wrong side, and you have to take the thing apart to get it all out. I too now simply clean the box out with a scoop like a regular litter box. I will be throwing this box out when I move next."
1,I tried to like them. I really did.,"I ended up with three of these litterboxes...from other people who hated them as well. Here's the thing: With the grate in, they're very cramped for even the tiniest cat. Your cat can just deal with it for your convenience? Not so, my friend. Because of the cramped quarters, your cat will inevitably end up defecating or urinating on the grate...which makes the entire ""sifting"" action of it virtually nil.So, as it stands, I'm yanking the grate, covering up the drawer hole, and using my reliable old scoop."
3,Convenient but not sanitary,"This litter box is a clever product and I would recommend it for the price, but be aware that your cat may have difficulty moving around inside it as well as the roof tends to get coverred with crap which can make for a dirty tail."
2,Didn't think it was much of an improvement,"First of all, it was difficult (really, impossible) to put it together in a way that litter wouldn't leak out whenever the box was rolled to clean it; the parts fit very poorly. Secondly, if your cat uses scoopable litter now, you know that sometimes the liquid penetrates to the bottom of the box so instead of having a discrete clump, you have a clump stuck to the box. The Omega Paw does not deal with these at all, so you still end up scraping and scooping, albeit less often than with a regular box. Thirdly, this box is big, so big that it was a problem to give it enough space so that it could be rolled over to clean. Because of this, it was also bulky and awkward to wash. I used it for awhile, didn't hate it, but disliked it enough to get rid of it when I moved."
2,adult material,"Leroi Jones' plays are just a little too profane for my tastes. I was struck by the message in the text, but could have done without some of the language. I don't want to sound too much like Ned Flanders, but it's just too much for me to handle."
3,Pure Fury...No Solution,"This play is written beautifully in a style that resembles some very late American Dadaist poetry. However if you take the play as a whole, this play lacks any didactic purpose. Baraka is hypocritical in that he has become the hate-monger that he despises. Other than wonderful banter and a powerfully angst-ridden diatribe, this play offers nothing but hate and intolerance."
5,A must-have Mendelssohn!,"For any fan of the violin, Hilary Hahn is simply one of life's joys these days. Her technique is staggering -- beyond even other virtuosi in the way Heifetz was a little beyond the other great violinists of the mid-20th century.But Hahn is also a thoughtful musician. Who doesn't love Perlman, but so much of his work at this age was technically lush, but interpretively dry and dull. Hahn, by contrast, is a thinker and a risk-taker. Even if you cringe at her interpretations some times (and I don't for the most part) you have to admire her willingness to try for a fresh take. She will develop and develop, and I hope I'm still around when she is making her third and fourth recordings of these pieces in her 50s and 60s.Anyway, this Mendelssohn is fantastic. The third movement alone is worth the price of the CD -- she takes a very fast tempo and just whips up this wonderful sweet confection."
2,"Mendelssohn, 3rd Movement","Hilary Hahn has a great technique. I loved her Bach even more than Grumiaux's. I figured you couldn't lose with the stuff she uses. I was wrong. What in the world did this young lady do to the 3rd movement of the Mendelssohn? Did she have to run off to the loo or something? I bet the conductor's arm nearly fell off when she sprinted away. She lost all clear articulation when she did that and she also lost the orchestra in a couple of places. As a violin teacher, I would have to tell her to come back to that passage and play it again, slower, and with some clear articulation.It was so rushed I couldn't catch up enough to hear some music. It looks I'm going to keep listening to the old guys on this one ;-). Isaac Stern's and Fritz Kreisler's have left pleasant memories."
3,Hahn is no Perlman or Chang,"Her playing reminds me more of Midori- a good technician, but lacking the ability to reach the ""soul"" of the music. Great artists such as Itzak Perlman or Sarah Chang (whom Yehudi Menuhin called ""the world's most perfect violinist"") are not only able to handle the technical details flawlessly but can bring the music to life in a way that brings tears to the eyes. This does not happen when I hear Ms. Hahn's playing."
2,"All right, if you want to live in a hotel room","I had great hopes for this book, but alas I did not find much useful information. The author's background in commercial cleaning and design shows that he has a tendency towards hotel-style decoration and has a strange liking for carpet. NOT a great selection for keeping a house clean! I found other books and common sense more helpful and would not recommend this book to a friend, even if they were building a house from scratch."
3,No quite what I'd expected.,"I purchased this book expecting it to contain tips for ways to decorate your home in order to significantly reduce your house cleaning work load. However, this book is really more of a ""how to BUILD a home to reduce housework"" kind of book. At the very least one would need to significantly remodel in order to put many of the ideas within into practice.I was disappointed."
3,poor weld on the neck,"The price on this was great,But after installation and when the engine got up to 190-200 degrees operating temp. the neck started to leak and spray coolant everywhere. when it was removed and inspected it turned out the weld that holds the neck to the base was not done properly. Moroso 63465 Manifold Filler Neck"
5,Brilliant Book,"Recieved item within 6 days, which was beyond expectations.The book per se is a historical statement, challenging the hegemony of western science"
4,"Difficult reading, but well worth it","The first half, which sets up the points the author makes in the second half is brutal. However, when Feyerabend gets around to making his point you see it was all worth it. If the front nine wasn't so brutal, I'd give it a five."
1,Earthbound Yoga,I thought this was a waste of money. The quality is poor and boring. I got much more info from Vasant Lad's book Ayurvedic Home Remedies. I found it misleading in that it was going to show you how to make decotions and it does not. It is a woman giving a talk at a library that looks like her mother may have filmed it with her 1963 vintage VCR movie camera. As yoga teachers and Ayurvedic practicioners my husband and I were very disappointed!
2,complaint,"tube's that where sent where designed for 29 gallon tank, thank god i had a course in basic plumbing, so i could cut them myself. rescieved two day's late. think seller should a leas provide me w/ gift card and trouble. gave seller my opion and no response think their more interested in the money."
4,Great for starters...,"...they'll likely end up being team starters! I first saw this at a friend's house and had to buy it for my son, even though he's almost outgrown it. It's a fun little flick especially for kids just starting out (4-7 age range)...obviously useful for softball or T-ball as well."
2,Very disappointing!,"My four- and five-year old grandchildren (and I!) thought this was an extremely lame production. The songs and ""comedy"" were painful to hear. There's a small amount of useful technical information but overall it just wasn't worth the money. I wanted it to teach the kids how to play baseball and I wanted to learn enough about hitting and fielding to understand all the plays when I watch a game. I'm even embarrassed to give this to Goodwill."
3,"not to bad, not to good","this movie is about two wanna be pimps who take these two girls to spring break in cancun, mexico. one of the girls is a straight up dime piece and the other is ok, not ugly. the movie looks like it was shot with a camcorder, its not very good. dont buy this movie, i recommend you rent it though just for the one girl in the movie, she is worth $3.50 at blockbuster anyday."
5,Really Great Computer,"This HP comupter was a really great deal for all the features it provides. I can browse the internet, burn CDs, get technical support if I need it, and do a lot of really cool things that I could never do on my old computer, which is now five years old. I am also very impressed with Windows XP because it is quick and very worth the money paid. Another thing I like is that this computer is fairly computer friendly. In the first hour I was using it, I burned two CDs, listened to music, surfed the internet and started to watch a DVD. Not only does it work very well, but it looks good too; it's very stylish. I reccomend anyone who buys this computer also gets the HP pavilion f1703 moniter because it's adjustible and has excellent color quality. This is a very good computer and I reccomend first computer buyers to get this computer."
5,It doesn't get any better!,"Firstly, I am not a huge Barbie fan BUT I must admit that movies don't get better than this ....I bought this for my little girl who is 18 months old .... I am a ballet lover of old and I felt that Swanlake was a great story and after watching Barbie of SwanLake think that the movie was an absolutely beautiful adaptation of the renowned ballet!The music is fantastic, the messages for your kid/s are great (same as the ballet acutally), and the animation is the best I have seen in any computer-created movie!I recommend you rent, borrow, or buy this for your kid/s, or yourself ..... I thorougly enjoyed watching this myself ... in fact, truth be told I purchased this for myself!If you want something a little different from the main stream that is simply spectacular and enjoyable, this is your movie."
1,Not for young children,I would not recommend this movie for younger children. I think it's too scary.
4,You're Braver Than You Think You Are,Barbie is brave! Cute and funny story with a great message for girls (or anyone) about facing your fears and finding courage when you have none. Lovely music and dancing too. Highly recommended.
3,Use Caution for Young Children,"I got this movie for my 3yr old because she loved 12 Dancing Princess. The movie only had a little bit of dancing and more of a dark story line. My daughter was afraid of the evil wizard and was upset when she thought Barbie died 2x's.I think this movie would be okay for older children. All in all it is better than tv. Once my daughter gets older, I will bring the movie back into circulation.I wish there was more dancing. We loved the 12 dancing princesses."
1,Too SCARY for toddlers! Get your act together 'Mattel'!,"The 'Mattel' and 'Mainframe' entertainment companies should be ashamed of themselves for releasing this UNRATED animation movie, with NO age recommendations on it's DVD case! My 3 year old was terrified at certain scenes in this movie. The 'innocent Barbie' theme is misleading. I'm no religious zealot or uber conservative here, but these companies should really indicate (on the packaging) that these movies can indeed scare some toddlers! All they care about is their money and profits. All the MANY negative 1-star reviews here are NO COINCIDENCE!"
1,A dumb lil' animal Killed Ivan.,"What a dumb movie,that stupid little skunk killed Ivan.I said to Johannah''Ivan got killed.""And she says...""No he did'nt.""But Carlita just did that.I really hated this movie! This movie is sooooooo BAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I'm to mean bout' this.I H8 this junk."
2,"Coming after Rapunzel, a disappointment","Coming off what I felt to be a very well done adaptation of the Rapunzel story, I felt Swan Lake to be a serious disappointment. The characters in this story are very different from it's predicessor. Odette's friends are hardly likable, the only exception being an amusing troll. The story line is disjunct and the computer animation (especially the children dancing)is rather poor and awkward. Gothbart the villian, is voiced wonderfully by Kelsey Grammer and is the only exceptional part of this production. Odelle (Gothbart's daughter and Odette's antithesis) is simply appauling in concept, pushing offensive, and it is difficult to watch the interaction between the two without feeling somewhat disturbed by the contrast.Sadly, I feel that this represents a poor general effort on the part of the creators and am left to wonder why they waisted their time on such a weak project.Rapunzel is the way to go. The story line is well done and truly uplifting."
1,STOP THE MADNESS!!!!!!!!!!!,People are fighting each other in the streets. Terrorists are all over the globe. And the craziness is caused by: Barbie of Swan Lake.I was practically gagging when I saw this mess of a movie. NOT WORTH YOUR TIME!!! BARBIE MUST ...!!
3,It's alright,"Looks like metal, but it is really just plastic-y. it does it's job but it is just kinda cheap feeling."
1,Don't people read the list of ingredients?,43.2% Corn Syrup Solids? 10.2% Sugar (Sucrose)?That's over 50% sweeteners! How can any responsible parent give this to his or her child? How can any company sell this product? Don't people read the list of ingredients?Avoid it! Trash it!
2,Midsomer Murders - Set 8,still like the series but do not like the new Sgt. He is awful in my opinion. Of all the series # 8 is mediocre at best.
5,From time past,Perhaps no better way to understand the ethos of a culture than toknow its' legends. Ginzberg is the classic
1,You tell me,"I did not buy this product but I had this experience with this manufacturer (X10). I originally bought a home security system from the manufacturer directly X10. What a mistake, the salesman told me it could have an exterior alarm but after two months of trying to make it work (Often I waited 5 to 7 days before someone got back to me) they gave up and told me it would not work and never should have been promised in the first place. They also use an antiquated way of sending messages to indoor sirens that causes all sorts of problems. Eventually, they offered a refund and I have been waiting over 3 months to receive it. I think this manufacturer might be the worst and possibly the most dishonest company I have ever dealt with."
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!!,"My daughter has wanted this item ever since she saw it on TV with tons and tons of bubbles blowing out......it blows 1 bubble and pops, it is like the arm is not aimed correctly and so the bubble hits the seashell and pops immediatly. Definatly not worth the money I am taking it back to the store."
1,LOUD,The motor is very loud.Not a lot of bubbles are produced as they show in theircommercial.Don't waste your money.
2,Poorly made toy.,"I took this toy back to the store the day after my daughter opened it. It made the most awful sound when turned on. I believe the motor was defective. It scared my daughter so much she didn't want a new one. Even without the noise, the bubble wand kept falling off and it is supposed to be a toy you can play with in the tub, but I believe with a motor and batteries, that is not a good idea."
4,Good toy,"I purchased this toy today for my daughter. It really is cute to look at and since I didn't have much luck with the Bratz Bubble blowing doll, I figured I'd give this one a shot. While the bubble blowing is continuous, the area where the bubble wand sticks into just fits and for some unknown reason, instead of fully surrounding the wands stick, it has a slight opening in the tube which, after a few minutes of bubble blowing, the wand falls out. I am going to try glue to keep it in there. It also isn't too sturdy as it is roundish in shape so when you turn it on and off, you need to use two hands. There is nothing educational about this toy but who cares! You really are purchasing it for the bubbles which it really does a good job of blowing. To make even more bubbles, I would suggest picking up a bottle of the gazzilion bubbles as they work much better than the ones that came with the set."
1,Not good,"I am disappointed that the description never once mentions that you need the old Mac OS9 for this in order to play it. This games does not work with modern operating systems. If you have something at least 15 years old, you can play this. Other than that, you will waste your money."
5,Harry Potter,It's a great movie. I have all of the Harry Potter movies. These are a must see for all age groups.
4,Chamber of Fun,"It was a fun movie to watch! I didn't give it 5 stars because it was it's not my favorite of the series, but still a good movie."
1,not what I expected,"The Blu-ray DVD seems to be only the special features, and there are a lot of them, but I could not find the movies themselves on either disk, and had to go out and buy one, just to watch the actual films."
3,The book is better,"A bit childish, but fun. Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) and Emma Watson (Hermione Granger) are exellent, but Daniel Radcliffe is almost expressionless in his lack of interperation of Harry Potter. If the look on his face changed at all it wasn't convincing. I began to wonder if he was only hired for the job because he looks like Potter. The boy simply can't act. Other than that the movie is wonderful and very truthful to the book."
5,Excellent!!!,Okay this movie is a must see. It has a much tighter plot than the first one and the story is edgier and darker too. It didn't feel like 2 and a half hours of watching a flick. JK's imagination combined with high-budget effects certainly made the experience magical. Everything was exactly how i imagined it to be while reading the books. One thing I want to commend is the faithfulness of this movie. Almost everthing was perfectly identical to the published work. Thats the best part.
4,Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets,This is a great DVD! The reason I gave it only 4 stars is because this movie gets old after you watch it alot. Besides that it's excellent.
5,AWESOME MOVIE- BETTER THAN FIRST!,"This movie is awesome- no words can desribe how great it is. The Chamber of Secrets is better than The Lord of the Rings, which is a boring movie. There is comedy, and lots more excitement everywhere you turn. The ending of the movie is a big twist, and is very heart pounding. This is my absolute favorite movie of all time. I will never get tired of the movie! Go and get it now!!"
3,The Worst Out of the Series As of Now,"Compared to the other two movies that have been released, this has to be the worst of them. It seems to just drag on for hours on end, and even though I enjoyed the book greatly, it was not my favorite movie. I cannot insult it too greatly as it is Harry Potter, a favorite of mine, but I will say, defintley not a purchase movie. This one's a rental."
2,As Bad as the First Harry Potter Movie,"I'm sorry to say that I almost hated this movie. I've read all the Harry Potter books and they are all so outstanding. Unfortunately, the two movies are devoid of the magic that made the books so special. Let's hope the new director of the third movie changes that."
4,Good Movie - Not my favorite,"Obviously, I love all the Harry Potter movies, this one included. After the book, though, there is SO much left out due to time constraints - plus, I'm not a big fan of bugs. Still is a great movie, and is one of the standards in my collection. It's fun and interesting to see the development of the actors since the first movie. They (the actors AND the movies) just keep getting better and better. Don't miss out on this one!"
2,DVD missing scenes!!!,"I am most distressed to find that the ""Widescreen Special Edition"" DVD I purchased is missing numerous small scenes-scenes that are integral to understanding the story!!I have also noticed missing scenes in the Sorceror's Stone and the Prisoner of Azkaban, which are ""Special Editions"" as well.I, for one, will purchase no more Harry Potter DVD's until this practice stops. I am quite disgusted with the Harry Potter marketers and producers--I feel that I have been cheated out of my money.When JK Rowling and etc. begin selling unabridged products, I will consider purchasing her movies again.The movies themselves are good; the DVD's are an outright rip-off.BUYER BEWARE!!!Disappointed fan"
1,NO DIGITAL COPY!!!,"Do not be surprised when you receive this and your digital copy code expired OVER A YEAR AGO. Completely ridiculous, but you know what? I am not even a little bit surprised. Typical WB just trying to get every little penny possible for this franchise."
4,"Good DVD, but could have been better","I love the Harry Potter movies (and books) and already have the DVD. The movie is wonderful and my older child loves it too. I was however disappointed that the 19 additional/extended scenes were not blended into the theatrical version. I think that Peter Jackson's ""Fellowship of the Ring-Extended version"" has set a presidence for future DVD releases. I would have enjoyed the movie even more with the deleted scenes returned to the movie. Perhaps that will come later-lets hope!"
3,Potter Goes Snake Eyes!,"The house elf Dobby visits Harry Potter in his room in order to warn him that someone wants to hurt him if he goes back to Hogwarts. There is also someone who is trying to prevent Harry to reach the Hogwarts Academy. However, after some struggle he arrives at Hogwarts Academy where someone or something is petrifying students and every time Harry seems to be present. This ends up turning around against Harry as he becomes the main suspect who is petrifying the students at Hogwarts Academy. This sequel to Harry Potter does not live up to the level of its predecessor because the story sometimes feels forced and flat. However, the superb cast provides an excellent performance that is a pleasure for the eye."
4,Harry Potter makes up for the first film's mistakes,"The first Harry Potter movie was a flop. This one is a triupmh.It has improved itself in every area, from character development, to cinematography, to and especially in special effects, the best in my opinion since Jurassic Park.This movie must be seen to be believed."
4,Watch till the very last credit rolls for extra footage!,"Since I have just finished rereading the book the night before we went to see the movie, I thought the sequences were a bit choppy. My fiance liked it a lot though and pointed out that no movies can ever be true to their origins.A lot of people usually leave when the end credits are rolling, but please be patient this time because you'll end up seeing something extra! We found out because I just NEEDED to know if Chris Columbus had dedicated this movie to the late Richard Harris..."
5,Best Movie of the Year!,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is an exciting and sometimes scary movie! I found it very entertaining and that all the actors did a beautiful job on their characters. It all starts when Ron and Harry almost get suspended for flying a car in the air and had seven muggle witnesses. From there it's a very excellent film. But I would not recommend this movie to anyone who is under 5, it can be very scary and discusting (escpecially when Ron throws up slugs). Other then that this movie will definetely do well in the box office! Harry Potter rules!"
2,The book was better,The movie is nothing like the book. The movie is a horrible joke. It wasn't funny if thats what their getting at. The book was actually enjoyable but the movie didn't follow the book that well. The acting was stupid. They were the worst actors ever. Don't buy or see this movie it will be a waste of your money. The special effects were also a bad joke.
2,The Chamber of Secrets Should Not Have Been Opened,"The same story continues, but this time around they deal with a snake. It even has a language of its own. Give me a break! But the way they made the film, it seems so real. I don't like it because it is scary, but I love the school setting. It took me back to the days when I was a student. The teacher is so self-absorbed that it is ridiculous. I probably won't review the rest because I don't remember the other storylines, and there is a huge snake towards the end. That's why I stopped watching, but I'm sure Harry will win because that's just how it happens in movies...real life is different: you win some, you lose some."
2,The Magic is Gone,"I was eternally disappointed in the second film in the harry potter series.towards the beginning of the film, ron's wand snaps in half, and even though he tapes it together, the magic seeps out of it and out of this inadvertantly hysterical film.director chris columbus seems to refer a lot to his earlier home alone films for the ""comedy"" bits of the film, which brought laughs from all the tiny children in the audience, who just love to see people fall down and do splits.the rest of the film is raiders of the lost ark...with good acting and plenty of mindless action but no character development or depth.in short, this film should appeal to children, or people with childish taste in film, but should repel more mature film critics."
1,not good,"ok this is the part i hate it when percey,fred,georgeron,hermione and harry were so mad at mr malfoyi hate the part when hermoine was too madat mr malfoy and she said we don,t trustyou this is no joyful this is a rat"
2,EH,"The Harry Potter books are so good, which makes writing this review so hard. The whole movie is very sloppy(so was the first one)the problem is that they tried to throw it all together too fast to make as much money as they could off pottermania. They really needed two things to make any of the movies great.1. They should of waited for all the books to be published before writing the script and filming. For a tighter production.2. Hire Peter Jackson he obviously knows a thing or two about making a fantastic fantasy film."
5,Harry Potter Is Back,"Great Acting By The Cast, And Very Much In Tact With The Book. Its A Great Familyt Movie Full Of Scary Surprises, And Alot Of Comedic Standpoints. This One Will Surely Stand The Test Of Time In Movies..."
5,"Great product, great price.",I purchased this for my husband for a great low price. I received the prouduct in excellent condition very quickly..Would order again.
4,Excellent but still not Perfect,"Don't take my title or rating the wrong way. My experience with the first 2 Harry Potter Movies have been excellent, but in the 2nd movie, the Chamber of Secrets, A lot of parts were taken out. In the movie theather, only a few ,dont need to know,details were taken out from the book. In the movie when it was released, had deleted most of the scenes. My sis ter was watching it yesterday and kept asking me questions because she didnt understand. She never read the book. I reccomend you read the book and watch and/or read the Sorceror's Stone, before you watch this movie. I hope next time they put out a better movie with less scenes that are taken out. I loved the movie though. I could watch it hundreds of times and be filled with laughs and some tears. I also liked the loads of extra features in it. There were many small games, like one, you had to drive the flying car out of the forbidden forest, away from aragog. I highly reccomend this movie."
3,"A small DVD, A LONG movie","I have all 3 Harry Potter movies on mini DVD, and since they're so LONG, they had to put them on 3 discs. Still, quality is very good and works in my DVD player. (...)"
4,Recommend,"I would recommend this movie, I like that it kept along the lines of the book as well. Great show for girls and boys alike."
2,rated PG?,"i have no idea why this movie was given a PG rating, there where many disturbing scenes in the movie that i thought was too much for the kids, like the dead cat and the ghost that hung himself... i think the harry potter series is some sort of brainwashing program that will end up bieng a big cult. the author of this book has a warped sense of imagination and should stick to her previous career, selling cookies or whatever the [heck] she did before she wrote this discrace in literature called harry potter."
1,DISAPPOINTED,I tried to contact this seller and he would not return any e-mails or anything to talk to me concerning the DVD that he sent to us. The DVD had scratches on it and stalls in places where you miss some of the movie. I will not be buying from this seller again. Buyer beware.
1,It's A No Show,"I was guaranteed that this movie ""the chamber of secrets"" would arrive in time for Christmas. That never happened and then I was informed that it was cancelled and no longer available. I was very disappointed and feel the site is not very responsible."
1,I got your title!,"If there was a post on the site about the DVD being HD, I didn't see it. Won't play on my DVD player, suppose I could use it as a drink coaster."
4,"Better acting, that's for sure.",The trio is growing up. And so are their acting skills. I loved the ending with the... wait no spoilers! Great movie!
3,-- Good --,"It is good to watch, but not as good as Part I . If the special effects were given more attention it would have come out much better."
5,"Quick, Easy and spectacular",It was easy to watch and looked really great in HD. We watched the other movies in regular format and the difference was clear!
5,Great Movie!,Love the actors and actresses! They did a great job making this movie! We loved reading the books and watching the movies!
5,The best in the collection!!,"We have a lot of DVD's in our collection, and this one is by far the most-viewed. The thrilling plot and climax keep you on the edge of your seat, even after you have read the book!! Daniel Radcliffe gives an excellent portrayl of Harry Potter, as do the other actors and actresses. Even if you aren't a big fan, you should still view the movie as it has amazing technology advances, an exciting plot and climax, and excellent actors. Not just for kids!! A highly reccomended movie from a Harry Potter freak!!"
5,"Just a little less magical than the first, but still great!","The 2-DVD set that you'll get when you buy this are well worth the money. In this, the second movie in the Harry Potter series, you'll find all of the same loveable characters from the first moveir, and some new ones as well. In this movie, Harry is a year older, and has more battles with Draco Malfoy, and then now has to save Hogwart's from the dreaded creature in the Chamber of Secrets.The action scenes can be a little intense for younger viewers, but still will be timeless in its direction and pure enjoyment level. The second disc contains 19 extra cut secenes, and interviews with the cast and author.I highly enjoyed this movie, and look forward to seeing it again."
2,Slavishly copies book without capturing any of its charm,"I think that this movie is extraordinarily boring. Unlike the first film, which took some liberties with the material in the interests of time, the sequel simply left out some of the most charming scenes in the book without really transitioning to the next event. The cast was, of course, excellent, and the sets wonderful, but the film was so predictable in every aspect that watching it was a tedious chore. A literary adaptation is only good if it contributes something new to the material, and this one doesn't."
5,Better than the first!,"I saw this movie on the first day. It was really good. The special effects were better and more believable than the first movie. It follows the book about the same as the first, except I think there is less stuff cut off. There are a bunch of laughs in this movie, too. All the actors seem a little more grown up. All the people that I saw it with thought this one was better than the last, both in the story and the movie making. I just hope that the next one will be this good, too."
3,Not as good as others,"Movie strayed quite a bit from the book, and we found Dumbledore to be less sage and kind in this movie than in the first and second."
2,Poor quality reproduction,"I wasn't very impressed.This is a poor quality reproduction, not much better than DVD quality. Really disappointing I thought. I hope they've improved it since I bought my copy."
4,A job well done by Chris Colombus and crew!,"How often have I heard, ""The book is better than the movie.""? Well, for just about every book that is turned into a motion picture I have! It is a difficult task to take what a reader has seen while reading and project those images on film. The second installment of the Harry Potter series is a success, capturing the feel, characters, and places of Rowling's worlds. This two disc set has plenty of extra features, including deleted scenes, for anyone who wishes to go even further into the world of magic and wizardry."
4,Good sequel,"The movies for the Harry Potter series have been solid, and Chamber of Secrets has been no exception. It was especially nice to see Tom Riddle 'visualized' in the movie - sure, I can picture for myself what is happening in the books, but sometimes it is fun to see what a movie does to the book (as long as it's well-done)"
5,Great Movie,"I love watching the Harry Potter movies, and reading the books. It's nice to read a book and then watch a movie made about it and see that they go together great."
4,Columbus Does it Again,Chris Columbus has done it again! The Chamber of Secrets is even better than its predecessor. It has more humor and action than before. The music captures the moment in almost every scene. The basilisk and Fawkes look absolutely real and the visuals have improved. The Quidditch match is action-packed and the scene in which Harry fights the basilisk is thrilling. I have nothing negative to say. I simply love this film.
5,"Excellent movie, good special features","The movie, is fun and exciting, as is to be expected. Although both this movie and its predicessors are perhaps so much like the books that a certain amount of creativity or freedom seems lost to the movie's director and producer. This detracts little for the true Harry Potter enthusiest."
3,Harry has no re-play,"This was a great movie and in many ways superior to the first in the series - however the film has very little re-play value. I got the DVD and quickly popped it in my DVD player looking to recapture the magic of that day when I saw it in the theater and was disappointed. Having not read the books I had no clue about the story when I sat down in that darken theater - so as the simplistic (yet more complex than the first) plot unfolded I was entertained and impressed. However once you know the story the movie has very little to offer. The DVD set is nice and is more inclusive than the first, it also looks nice next to the first film on my shelf and I'm afraid it's going to stay there for awhile, perhaps I'll watch it again when part three comes out."
5,Loved it!,"Daniel Radcliffe is the only Harry Potter! I love this movie! I think most people, even people who are not H. P. fans, will love this movie. I give it 5 stars! A must-see!"
4,Worse than Sorcer's Stone,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was a lot better. The ""Matured Daniel"" has become better in acting. But the overall movie was worse than Sorcerer's Stone."
2,These kids still can't act,"The disappointing acting from the three young stars is marginally improved, but none of them is convincing for a second. Worse, the magical world of Hogwarts has lost its charm the second time around, and the special effects (especially the really dreadful snake) are strictly grade-B. This movie lacks any excitement or genuine pleasure."
3,What about the book?,"The movie was good, even great if you haven't read the book. It poorly followed the book and all of us crazed, wierd, Harry Potter fanatics will be left tripping along as things move to quickly through the story, with strange unnecessary additions to the small parts, and giant cuts in the important and big parts. I liked the movie and I plan on buying it to go along with my collection (of course I'm considered on of the most serious Harry Potter fanatics in my high school so of course I would buy it and like it) but, I think that if you're a big fan of the books than you will be dissapointed. But, that's only a matter of opinion. I would reccomend this movie and do reccomend it, but if you've read the books you might want to lower your expectations and forget the way the book was. Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix comes out on June 21st! Don't forget! Harry Potter forever!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,I had all the other DVDs except this one and one more. My collection is now complete.
3,"Good movie, but could have been better","I enjoyed it in the theater, and it made a good gift for my sister, but personally, I'd just get it from the library instead of paying for it."
5,Great,The item I ordered came earlier than promised and was exactly what it said in the description of the item.
4,Good for a kids movie.,"I watched this movie when it first came out. Let me tell you I was rather impressed. My son was more interested than I, when it started, but before it was over I was at the edge of my seat as well. Good family get together movie. Lots of action but not to grown up."
4,Chamber of Secrets Yields Interesting Revelations,"In this second part of Harry's adventures we get to meet again, his arch enemy, Voldermort,but with a different swing of occurences combined with a new character called Dobby who warns Harry of terrible disaster if he returns to Hogwarts! Harry ,of course, ignores these dire warnings and arrives at Hogwarts to find himself at odds with Draco Malfoy and ensnared in a mystery which leads him to The Chamber of Secrets. This movie will keep you intrigued as well as amazed with new characters like Moaning Myrtle, with disappearances and students turned to stone! A must see movie for all ages."
4,True to the Book,"I think the best thing about the Harry Potter movies is that they stay true to the book. Upon watching both films in the theater, I noticed a bunch of young viewers reciting the lines along with the characters. This was on opening day, so it's not like they'd already seen the movie. The quiddich scenes are even better this time out. I am a big fan of the novels and the movies. Can't wait for the next one."
4,Intriguing!,"I throughly enjoyed watching Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. It was reliving the book, just without as many details. Even though I prefer the book over the dvd, I would like to say the characters and settings were brought to life quite flawlessly."
5,Great ... but way scary for young kids.,"This movie is as good as the book on which it's based. It's surprisingly faithful, though I wish they'd have let the audience know more about Ginny Weasley's crush on Harry Potter. It's as good as the first movie, occasionally it's even better.But the reason I'm writing this review is to warn people that, though ""Chamber of Secrets"" is excellent cinema, some of it is downright scary. The spider chase scene is genuinely frightening, and moments involving a giant snake could be too much for little kids to take.Watch it before you show it to younger kids. That way, you end up catching a good movie twice, and you can determine whether your kids should watch it at all."
5,Problem with the Trailer,"I heard about this movie and I view the movie trailer for it, but it took 30 seconds. I want to look for the one that shows the whole entire preview like the one I saw when I saw Scooby-Doo the movie."
5,Chamber of Secrets is opened!,"I have not seen the movie yet because it is not out yet, but I do have my tickets for opening night. I have read the book a lot of times and loved it. I also have seen the trailer about a thousand times. I go to harrypotter.com to see the countdown everyday. Harry Potter is the best book series for kids and the movies are just the same. I cannot wait till this movie comes out!!!"
3,A fair attepmt,"As an avid lover of the Harry Potter series, I must say I found the movie only adequate. Maybe I'm just a purist, but I found the added scenes not found in the book quite annoying. Such as in the flying car scene when Harry falls out of the car as the follow the train to hogwarts.Other then my slight nitpicking, the performaces by the actors were great. It was nice to see the cast grow in age as well as acting talent over the year. The costuming was perfect, the special effects stunning. The adaptation from the book though, was lackluster."
1,Not very interesting.,"Sorry, folks, but I found the movie to be slow moving and very uninteresting. I guess it's just me, but I don't believe Harry Potter to be that great. I fell asleep with the movie still in its first hour. The pace, action, and acting are interesting only to those with less than sophisticated tastes. This movie could have been (and probably should have been) done in less than 90 minutes."
1,Never got it...,"This is the second time in a row that this DVD was never mailed to me, by two different senders. The first time I was refunded, but I have emailed this user twice and gotten no response."
1,Garbage,"""Chamber"" was always the worst entry in the Harry Potter series, but this film adaptation manages to take what was already a crappy story and make it even worse. Choppy editing, horrible humor personified by the untalented Rupert Grint, smug acting by the equally untalented Emma Watson, poor screenwriting by that hack Steve Kloves and incompetent direction by the other hack Chris Columbus makes this a very unpleasant experience.Skip it if you can."
1,they butchered the books,i am a huge fan of the books and i have been reading them since their american debut. i just cannot watch the movies. i don't feel they accuatly portrayed the characters and i don't feel they stuck to the book as well as they could have. they cut out scenes that were important and added scenes not in the book. they did a horible job. don't buy it.
1,Horrible!,"Well, after having seen and loved the first Harry Potter movie, I took my girlfriend to see the film we had both been waiting for. She liked it but I HATED it. JK Rowling's novel is trashed in this awful film. Don't waste your money on this movie. Stick with the Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone. This film is just morbid and disgusting, and if there were zero stars as an option, I would definitely select it."
1,Harry Potter Is a Joke!!!,"Once again we have to see a nerdy kid with some magical powers. Stop making these movies, they are simply horrible...0 Stars!!!"
5,Magical!,This movie was awesome! I thought it was so well done. It was almost exactly like the book. Somethings were left out but they weren't major things that ruined the movie. All the actors were great and well chosen. This movie was definately well worth the money and in my opinion I actually think this one was a little better than the first. Bet anyways this movie definately was magical!
4,"Unless they screw it up, this dvd will rock hard","Now it was not as good as part one, but The Chamber of Secrets really pleased me. My biggest fear going in was that Daniel Radcliffe had gotten too old to be any good in the role, but he still shines. Sure his voice is a little deeper, but these things happen. outstanding final performance for richard harris. must own."
1,Make sure you maxmize your purchase,"Before buying any extended edition, collector's editions, etc. HP fans should check out the Blu-Ray region free set on Amazon U.K. that has all 8 Movies plus the same on disk materials as what is offered in the Ultimate Editions (no collectible cards, booklets though). Why spend $30 on this set, when for about $20 more you can get the entire collection of movies, extra footage, interviews, etc. You can search the U.K. Amazon site for these keywords and read the reviews. Amazon does not allow posting external links to Amazon sites.Harry Potter - The Complete 8-Film Collection [Blu-ray] [2011][Region Free]Depending on what you are looking for, it may be well worth your time. Shipping from the U.K. was excellent."
4,"Good movie, bad translation","Rating this just as a movie, it is great. Rating it as a translation of the book, its not so good. Some of the funniest scenes in the book were changed (or left out). When Harry and Ron arrive at school, they look into the great hall and wonder where Professor Snape is when suddenly they hear his voice from behind them (very funny). The movie translation, they walk up the stairs and right up to Filch (not funny). The small side plots in the book were totally left out in the movie. It makes me wonder what kind of butcher job they are going to do to the third movie (probably in post production now)."
3,Missing in Action!,"Enjoying it going right along and when Harry lands in the Knockturn Alley store, he wrestles with the hand on the mantle and then leaves the store, completely leaving out the scene with Malfoy and his father making a trade with the store owner. WHY??? I feel gypped!"
5,Very good movie,"This is a very nice movie. It is a little scary and violent(I don't think you should let little kids see the snake part).The actors were really great too, and there's somthing good about all of them. Harry was heroic, Dumbledore was sweet, Hermione was cute, Ron was funny, Snape was cool and Malfoy was annoying(that's a good thing!). But I thought Lockhart should have been a liiitttlle more irritating, like in the book, where you can't stand him.The special features DVD is worth watching too. This is a must have movie!!"
3,The Video,"It was better than the first, but is still not quite there. Maybe the third time will be the charm and achieve movie greatness."
5,"Better than the first, best movie I have ever seen in years!",I watch this movie at the theatre and just bought it it was good in the theatre but was better on dvd! you should buy this movie you won't regret and if you don't buy it you'll regret!!...
2,not the best,the 2nd installment too the harry potter series wasn't the best out there. because i thought that the first harry potter movie was better since it was funnier.
2,Good but no where near great,"First of all the movies don't come close to comparing with the movies. In my opinion 2 stars is stretching it a little. I know they can't put every detail from the book in the movie but they do miss some things they shouldn't.Some things they made wrong were Mrs. Dursley's hair. In the book it's blonde. In the movie she has black hair. In the book Ron is quite a lot bigger than Harry, but in the movie they're very close to the same size(Harry might even be bigger).The rest in my opinion was pretty good but not great. Those things are big details that they obviously missed."
5,Yay! :),Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was better than I anticipated. Even the adults around me were cheering! Everyone should see this movie!
5,good as gold,The same familiar cast provides a pleasant and exciting movie. Greatly entertaining for the whole family.
5,What's not good about Harry?,Okay...Harry rules.The books are great and the movies are fun.I admit that this is the first of the four movies that start to show the darker side of Harry's world.The kids will love it and I find that a lot of adults do to.
5,THIS RULES!!!!!!!!!!!,I loved this movie. It was so incredibly awesome! I reccomend it to anyone who doesn't want to miss one of the world's best movies!
3,Go with the Book!,"Compared to the book, this movie was nothing. I would definantly NOT reccomend this movie to you if you have not read the book in the first place. It will be blurry and hard for you to understand at some parts. Even if you think you understand it, you DONT (If you havent read the book). I had to read the whole book to my little sister just so she could understand the movie better. Thank goodness most people have read the book, or else this movie would get poor ratings."
5,Greatest Movie Ever!...,"Me and my buddie Micheal Jackson cauhght this flick in the cinemas and thought ""WOW this is the greatest action flick ever!"" Daniel Radcliffe brings a macho smoldering [handsomeness] to his portrail of Harry Potter the simple minded satanist with his bad bee-yatch sidekick Hermione and gangstar peeps like Ron and Hagrid. Watch him battle evil and score more chicks than Dolemite and Shaft put together!Dis movie is DA BOM!"
3,gets old. very old .,"It's a good movie but, once you own it you get tired of it. unless you're a harry potter fanatic or some sort of collecter I`d just rent it. Well if your shaking your head right now admit it. Once you know every word that comes out of harry`s mouth or memerized all the spells said dosnt it seem minutely boring to you? My advice is read the book over and over. That way you might improve your vocbulary. All an all-- BUY THE BOOK!!!!!!!!"
5,WICKED!,"Although a little dissapointed with the first movie, I feel that the second installment of this series was great! Not only following more closly to the book, it also provided a better story line, improved acting, more humor, and improved special effects. I would be more then happy to recomended this movie to others since I myself loved it so much (saw it 5, count them 5 times in the theaters!)."
5,MORE WILD HARRY,"This second installment in the immensely popular series once again delivers a world of fantastic magical proportions. Most of the members of the original movie are back and once again director Chris Columbus weaves a tale of sorcery and danger for our young heroes. Notable new faces include a bombastic Kenneth Branagh and a nasty Jason Isaacs. With gorgeous sets, costumes and neat special effects, this movie should entertain all, even those of us who aren't Harry Potterphiles. Good moviemaking, though"
3,Faithful to the book,"While the first two Harry Potter books have a special place in my heart for the mere introduction of such a fantastic world, this movie struggles in its own medium due to being TOO faithful to the books. Sometimes an adaptation needs a little more to survive, and while there is an update in CGI effects in this movie compared to the first one, it just doesn't seem to do it for me. It's not a bad movie, though."
5,Gift,this was a christmas gift. my daughter was so excited to get this ultimate collection along with the others that she received. It's hp for goodness sakes. who wouldn't like it.
4,two thumbs up,"I was really pleased with harry potters chamber of secrets book. i never read the first one but i did see the movie. the oppisite for the second one, i never saw the movie but read the book. this book was not better than the first but it was very eqivalent. harry potter is one of the best things that kids have to look forward to these days. any other mentor has a cape and super powers, granted so does harry potter but he is a little more realistic. at least he is a real boy. i am 19 years old and i enjoyed this book. its for all ages and i suggest that anyone read it."
4,Scarier Than the First,"""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" is a good sequel to ""Harry Potters and the Socerer's Stone"". Much like the first movie, ""Chamber of Secrets"" is full of magic and fantasy. However, this film is much scarier than the first, something the surprised me a little. Even though I read the books, I was a little surprised by how graphic and violent some of the fight scenes were.Even though some of the scenes may have been a little too much for younger children, I would still recommend watching this film. I doubt there is a Harry Potter fan out there who hasn't, but those of you who aren't, this is a film to at least check out."
3,Harry Potter????,"The first two movies are very enjoyable of the Harry Potter series, one to watch with the older kids."
5,To Kristen from Pittsburgh,I hate to tell you Kristen but the actors are British because the movie and books takes place in LONDON. How dumb would that be if an American actor played Harry or anyone else? This movie is awesome just like the first one. I can't wait for the rest.
3,This could have been better,"I'm a big Harry Potter fan, really, but I thought this was a disappointing (I really hate to use that annoying word)movie. There was nothing very exciting until the end, otherwise it was pretty dull. It was not very detailed and you didn't get very ""acquainted"" with the characters like in the first movie. It was sort of vague, for lack of a better discription. Some parts were good, but overall I didn't like it that much. In my opinion the first movie was better. It felt like it was just a bunch of scenes put together, and it didn't get very interesting until the end. I really hope the third one is better. ..."
2,"A good effort, but rushed due to age restrictions.","Harry Potter should not have been made into movies. It may be a good idea, but every character has age restrictions, making the films rushed and causing people heart attacks when Harry's character gets a pimple or has a growth spurt. Another major criticism is that, like the first, more is put into the special effects than the plot and the storyline. The final con would be that, like the book, the plot elements are so obvious that they could have signs reading ""MAJOR PLOT ELEMENT"" next to them and give the same effect. Despite these flaws, it has some decent acting, making it not completely horrible, and for children or big fans of the series, I would give it 4 stars for being so faithful to the book."
2,alright,this harry potter movie was nowhere as fun as the first and third harry potter movie. still this movie has parts that is fun too see. and im glad that the cast is the same as the other harry potter movies.
3,An average movie,"I have read the books and seen the movies. They are both entertaining. Yet I can not say that this is a great movie. This is what it is, a decent director, medeoker actors, an interesting plot, and an acurate film version of the books. This is a good movie for 3rd to 6th graders. But that is all it is, a good movie. Nothing too special here yet you wouldnt be dissapointed if you rented it or got it off of amazon.com for JUST 15 DOLLARS. There a lot of worse movies you could see!"
4,Fine Sequel that might be even better than the original.,"Harry Potter and the chamber of secrets is the second of the books to be made into a movie, and in my opinion is the best so far. it's more moving and more special than the first film, and much better acted. Thanks to Daniel Radcliff and the gang for another year at Hogwards"
5,Not Evil,"Since I am a God-fearing, God-loving Christian,I had my reservations about watching the Harry Potter movies.I heard they were dark and evil.I found them to be entertaining and the biggest fact that I came out with is that the movie is more about love and loyalty to friends that wickedness.There are dark sides to everything but this I feel teaches what is good in people. Thank you. Teri"
3,"Bigger, Darker, and Missed some Key points","Movie in itself was fabulous, in fact I own it. However, it missed some key points from the book...anyone else miss the whole Ginny Weasley character development part of the movie, I know I did--oh and there was the whole Colin Creevy's Harry Potter fan club that was entirely not present. Umm why weren't some of the 20+ deleted scenes in the movie??Movie by itself great, movie compared to book not so great"
3,Read the Book,"If you only watch the movie, I think you will be confused, yet entertained. If you have read the book, you will be disappointed. Many parts of the book are cut, yet other parts of those particular storylines are still included, it doesn't make sense at times. It's still pretty good, but could have used more, I realize it's so long already, but I hope that for the others they will split it into 2 movies (or more in the case of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (706 whopping pages!). This would be a better idea, just like they do with the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. Overall, enjoyable, but the book is SOOOO much better. Be literate people =)"
2,You want an Harry Potter experience? Read the book.,"You want an Harry Potter experience? Read the book.I saw the movie last week and I wasn't impressed. In compare to the book the movie is boring, pointles, suffers a great lack of details and what ever bad thing cross your mind. The book has in it not only the main story line but also small sub stort lines which makes the book the good book it is. The movie has no such story lines and that really ruin the experience we got use to find in the books.If you still want to see this movie all I can say is that the second movie is better then the first one...Enjoy...."
2,Tale of two misfits...,"Acting and set improved since Sorcerer's Stone where the real petrification occurred.Cast for Chambers:Myrtle, Ron, Snape, Vernon - know how to act.Brannagh - real acting.Tom - ""I'll show you acting, Potter!""Dumbledore - Zzzzz.Fake snake - fake.Fawkes - fake savior against fake snake.Ginny & Potter - weird Oedipal resemblance to Lily and James.As usual, suspending belief is essential to understanding the story. Adults have no sense and only the Potter gangsters can bring salvation. So why isn't Professor McGonagall taking lessons from Potter? In a world where snooping is heroism, the tale of two misfits continues, either Harry or Tom will crack, for neither can live while the other fails at acting."
4,"""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" video Apr 11","'Harry Potter' Sequel on DVD in April'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' to Be Released on DVD and Video in AprilWed Jan 22, 9:58 AM""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" will materialize on home video April 11.The sequel about the boy wizard and his curious classmates at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry has collected $257.8 million at the domestic box office since it debuted Nov. 16.Among the extra features on the two-disc DVD are 19 scenes with deleted material, tours of sets from the film and an exclusive interview with ""Harry Potter"" author J.K. Rowling, Warner Home Video announced Tuesday.It will also include digital jigsaw puzzles, printable ""magic card"" collectibles and interviews with child stars Daniel Radcliffe, who plays Harry, and Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, who play his pals Ron and Hermione.""Chamber of Secrets"" also will be available in the VHS format.Associated Press"
3,A good story but lacking..,"The film is visually pleasing and executed very well, as should be expected from those who created it. The problem with it is the ""I've seen it all before symdrome."" It really doesn't try to break any ground, or show us that the edge is being pushed. I compare this to the new Matrix movie coming out, which will definitely push the edges of moviemaking. If your going to make a visual ""wowee zowee"" flick, try to instill some ""hey look at that"" stuff into the movie, or make the story twist and turn a bit more. Maybe diverting from the book a bit more will help, because what sometimes works in books, doesn't transfer to the big screen. Good movie overall though."
5,Chamber of Secrets is Wonderful.,"I would have to say this 2nd feature in the series is much prefered and more enjoyable than the 1st. One reason for this, i believe is the 2nd feature gets to skip all the explanatory and expository stuff in the 1st and jumps right into the storyline. One minor annoyance-the way Dobby keeps abusing himself in his 1st encounter with Harry. The flying car is kinda corny but kinda cool, and its good to see all the ""Potterites"" back where they belong at Hogwart's. (Even that dispicable Malfoy)"
2,URGH!,"I never received it! I paid for it, and never got it in the mail. So my issue is not with the movie but with the fact that I never got it!"
4,First film was way better but...,The first harry potter film was way better but the same can be said for the books in my opinion. The 2nd book chamber of secrets was my least favorite so i should have figured the film wouldn't be great since the book kinda [stunk] compared to the others. They did a good job on alot of the CGI were the film did lack in SS.
3,Too Bad... I expected better,"I was so naive to think that this movie would be a more entertaining one that the first. This movie is for kiddies who are still in their nurseries learning how to speak! Lord of the Rings is the real deal. If I was to rate the movie out of a five, there isn't even a number that low! If i were to rate the book out of a ten, there isn't even a number that high! I gave it a three because of all the special feautures and computer graphics."
4,Farewell to Dumbledore,"As the movie ended I was filled with a sense of well being, Harry Potter and the chamber of Secrets is much better than the first film. Daniel Radcliffe is still finding it difficult to act naturally. Richard Harris however is his wonderful self. I was thinking these thoughts as the credits started to roll..... and then I reliesed that we will no longer see Richard Harris in any film or on stage again. I stayed until all the credits had gone, but no dedication (the final reel had proberly already been produced, I normally like most people stand up and walk away when the credits start, but this time I sat there till the very end, much to the annoyance of my friends, but I think we owe it to Richard Harris who disliked Harry Potter but did it wondefully none the less. Go see the film it was great (two towers will be the one to wait for however), watch the film, but as a mark of respect wait until the credits finish and remember a great talented actor."
4,Well Done,Harry's back for another year at school and this episode is even better than the first one. Everything about Hogwarts comes to life beautifully. Kenneth Brannagh as the ham Defense against the dark arts teacher was brilliant. Even people who have never read the book or saw the first movie will enjoy this. My only concern is that the producers are goin to have to move fast on the next film because the young actors are going to be too mature for their roles soon.
4,Pretty Darn Good,"I didn't think too much of Harry Potter when The Sorcerer's Stone came out last year, but when it came to video and I rented it, I thought it wasn't bad. I thought that I should see The Chamber of Secrets at least once in theaters because the Quidditch scenes would look amazing on a bigger screen. I was not disappointed. The Harry Potter movies, so far, have been a lot better than I first thought. I highly reccommened it. The acting is very well done and the special effects are amazing."
5,Bloody Brilliant!,"This movie is even more wicked than the first. If you've read the books and seen the first movie you just gotta' see the second movie. The special effects are amazing and have improved a little since the first movie. This movie is a WHOLE lot more intense then the first. Since there's a big tree who beats up a car for being banged into, a Dueling club, Giant spiders, and a HUMONGOUS serpent that tries to eat Harry alive you would expect that it would be, maybe just a little, more intense then the first. I was definatly glued after the first 10 seconds into the movie, and I seriously don't think I blinked through the whole thing. You just gotta see this movie, (SURGEON GENERALS WARNING: It is Highly recommended that you get some eye drops to use after the movie as they may shrivle up and pop right out of you're head from dehydration). I'm glued, and I know you will be to if you see this movie."
5,Wonderful recording of a masterpiece,"Magnificent live performance, inspired and involving,with virtuosistic contributions of the solists. The recorded sound is excellent. -Just a comment- I wonder why the review following mine has been published. It is written by someone who informs us that he doesn't like the composer and criticises the other reviwers, instead of sticking to give his opinion on the performance.(But see what he writes in his other ""reviews..."") This complex symphony is a masterpiece,Nagano's recording is for me one of the best,maybe the best, I warmly raccomand it, hoping you will share my enthusiasm."
2,Staged/mechanical,"Not sure how else to say it, but this is chopped into sections, more than is called for. Messiaen wrote in a peculiar manner, phrasing is somewhat in blocks. Nagano takes things too methodically, there's not the right amount of blending.This Nagano/Berlin does not compare favorable with my first choice Ricardo Chailly/Concertgebouw, which I gladly give 5 Stars.Concerning the above reviews, which frankly I've NOT bothered to read, is very typical of amazon reviews. Too amny give away too many stars.Which frankly is not just and fair to alot better recordings.NOTE: Buyer beware.Sorry 2 stars.I have now become dis-enchanted with Messiaen as of last week. READ Wilbod's review of the opera St Francsis/Nagano.I have to agree with him.Messiaen was OK for about 3 months after which I lost interest.."
5,Master of the Slow and the Beautiful,I always love Bohm's meticulous extraction of beautiful music through slow tempi. Other conductors just skip through the nice pieces far too quickly.
2,No energy,"I've tried hard to like this set, being a huge fan of the Vienna Philharmonic, but Karl Bohm's direction is SO slow that it robs the music of all sense of forward movement. The 6th, in particular, is almost coma-inducing. On balance, I prefer Claudio Abbado's under-appreciated cycle with the same orchestra, although Abbado's 6th is a bit slow for my taste as well."
1,Not Good Enough,The quality of sound on this set is unacceptable at any price. I was deeply disappointed. There is nothing more to say.
3,Something weird.,"Okay...so I was kinda testing songs through samples and I listened to the samples of this album through the amazon player and I came across something incredibly strange. That song...Break It Down Again. I previewed it and to say what I heard was morbid is putting it quite nicely. Upon hearing it I went to google to see who sung the song, finding out it was by Tears for Fears. Well of course the lyrics to the song wasn't the same as what I heard. So I figured...maybe it was just a really sick parody? However google does not show a parody ever being made. This...was really disturbing. Does anyone have any thoughts on this? Are you hearing what I am hearing?"
1,Petula Clark fans,This was a big disappointment. Not up to Petula c;ark's usual performance. It appears that they just pulled together whatever they could to produce an album of duets. Only a couple of the tracks are worth listening to.
5,WOOF IS A PLEASER,"CAME BRAND NEW AND LOOKS EXACTLY AS PROMISED. SINCE NOT BREED SPECIFIC ALL THAT SEE THINK IT'S CUTE, CLEVER AND IT WAS PRICED RIGHT!"
4,Perfect for 3 dogs,This worked perfectly for our 3 dogs' walking gear. The only problem is that the metal is easily bent so one of the 3 bones is a little off. That is a minor complaint though.
5,dog bone wall hooks,"so cute! holds all three of our dogs' leashes, collars, harnesses, and bandannas greatly. they love having their leashes in view all the time. now they are able to bring them to me and let me know, it's time for a walk!"
2,Not worth the money,"While this product does have the retro look, it also functions (improperly) as though it had been sitting in a warehouse for half a century. Crank this robot up with the included key and you do get sparks in the helmet. However, this robot shuffles in place rather than walks. Danger, Will Robinson! Danger! Does not compute!"
3,"Great musicianship, but not dancy enough","Levine's account is a tad too perfunctory for my taste. I find Karajan's mid-'60s Decca album of the suites to be a much more idiomatic rendering. However, nobody can match Lanchbery or Monteux for sheer expressiveness and dramatic flair."
3,"Good, but not a classic","I enjoyed a few tracks but the rest for me did not move me enough. I think the best track is ""What is Love"", so sensual and well written. ""Emotional Rollercoaster"" is good easy listening. I wasn't thrilled overall."
3,Good album but...,"The album consists of a good soulful and jazzy selection of songs. I am equally impressed with her expressive vocal; gentle, assuring and yet powerful when necessary. However, her vocal has an ingredient that annoys me - I cannot pinpoint what it is. Perhaps, it's the feminine aspect of her voice that tells me that she's emotionally sensitive and hurt. Nevertheless, her quality of work is toutable. I greatly admire upcomers like her and Heather Headley... especially Heather Headley!!"
5,"Wake up, please!","Pleasing to the ears and relaxing for the heart. Each page of this love story must be turned carefully to appreciate the words that are being performed. Vivian tells the story for anyone who has ever been in love or merely dreamed of love with the accompaniment of jazz and soul with original melodies. This is one woman who is setting the musical record straight with untouchable class and pure talent. ""Emotional Rollercoaster"" was received well, but there is not enough promotion for this artist who has potential to take R&B; music where it has been dying to go. This is the Best New Artist of the Year.Recommendations for the heart:""What is Love?""""No Sitting by the Phone""""Ain't Nothing but Love""""Be Good to You""""Complete""Well...okay, okay...the whole thing!!!"
3,More Like A 3.5---Upcoming,"Vivian has the kind of voice that no one would mind listening to--although I must admit that some of the songs are lamely written. However, one of the best songs on the album is ""What Is Love""..this song is produced fully with amazing piano melodies and arrangement along with the melancholy feeling of being taken to subliminal bliss! Vivian, with a few minor improvements, will undoubtedly be a greater artist."
5,Better than Alicia Keys!!!!!,"She is really talented, they slept on this CD, nobody ever gave her any credit on this amazing album!!!But that's okay, she and we know she good.Everybody is all caught up in Alicia Keys, why??? that's not the first time somebody has ever played the piano and sang at the same time.Brian McKnight, Stevie Wonder, Smokie Norful...ect.Big deal, Songs in A Minor CD was good but they need to get off her and start on somebody else, like Vivian Green."
4,A Love Story To Be Told & Heard,"Vivian definitly has a great voice and a very well put together CD. I listen to it with open ears every time I put in my playlist. With this CD tho i have to fall back on it because i think it's too much for me. Its a keeper for the ladies and a piece for the men, If thats appropriate to say.There was no doubt that i had to have the CD when i heard ""Emotional Rollercoaster"" because of the entire layout of the song. It's still in the top when it comes down to the passion behind the voice. I was impressed that she delivered the same passion in all of the songs. I personally just wasnt feelin all of them at the same time. It's a one-of-those-day's type of releases. I GOTTA SAY that ""No Waiting By The Phone"" is one of my favorite tracks on the cd as well as ""What Is Love?"". I could play those three tracks over and over and never get tired of them. But the Story is still nice to hear."
4,Excellent debut,"I bought VG's cd mainly out of support - knowing that she was one of Jill Scott's former back-up singers & was not disappointed. It's good to see that some companies still try to roll out artists who are original & genuinely talented singer/songwriters. Viv's songs are deep & soulful with a touch of jazz, which I love and I agree that she & Heather Headley along with groups like Floetry & Kindred are breaths of fresh air to the music world.That being said on an initial listen, I felt that the songs melded one into the other seamlessly - there is a great balance of mid-tempo and slow love songs on this disc and it is definitely worth a listen. Out of 14 tracks there were only 2 that I really cannot get into (No Sittin By The Phone & Complete).The tracks that stand out to me are: 24 Hour Blue, What Is Love?,Emotional Rollercoaster, Affected, Fanatic & Ain't Nothin But LoveIt's amazing to me that this album did not get any kind of Grammy consideration."
4,I am feelin this,"Vivian's original voice is highlighted in this tale of love. I fell in love with the popular hit ""Emotional Rollercoaster"", and my absolute favorite is the powerful woman's anthem , ""Superwoman."" I haven't heard a song this inspiring and directive since Karen White made her song by the same name.It comes across with a message that tells every man that your woman must be accepted for the wonderful person she is, that includes imperfections and all. And it also explains that a relationship can only be as picture perfect as the two people involved can make it. There are a couple of songs I could skip over, but overall no one who is a fan of someone who can acutally SING should be without this album. She is one of the few people who deserve to have a CD, unlike some of the no talent @ss clowns that have songs.""Won't sit by the phone"" is also one of my favorites."
2,I expected more,"I bought this CD after hearing a couple of tunes on the radio. It took about 2 listens before I realized the background singing is better than the lead. I expected a lot more, but nearly all the tracks are full of her emotional/relationship garbage, and it isn't even good garbage. It's just ""you do me wroooonngg"". Didn't take a lot of creativity. The music is plain old radio keyboard boring..."
3,Great Voice but....,"I am trying to add some new music to my collection of Aretha Franklin, Diana Ross, Anita Baker, etc. but this new ""R&B"" is just not for me. Maybe I'm getting old but where are the strings, the melodies, the love?"
2,Nice Voice but she should sing someone elses material,"I don't get it. The first song has to have the lamest lyrics I've ever heard in any pop song. ""I wanna laugh until tears fall down my face and my abs are aching"" or how about ""I hope the children I sponsor down in Chile get the money I send and I wanna fly to Paris...with my husband""Achh!! Please hire a song writer. Almost all of the R&B divas of past sang professional songwriters compositions. Now we expect them to write their own and this is how we pay for it."
3,its okay !!!,when i heard this album i started to laugh because my mother bought it thinking it was going to be great . as we were afraid its not all that i mean sure she sings nice and the songs well some have nice kool beats but its just not the album you can jam to its nothing like jennifer lopez or even mariah carey albums ..its okay for [$$$] its good but if you want more nice kool beats and better lyrics get this is me...then by jennifer lopez and charbracelet by mariah carey ...
5,The best album I've heard in years!,"Wow! What album, what a voice, what a woman. Her lyrics are deep, her voice soulful, songs are so moving! I've had this album since one and a half years and I still listen to it every week, 'cause I can't get enough. In every song I still find deeper meanings to her lyrics, her emotions.My favorite songs are: ""Emotional Rollercoaster"", ""What is Love"", ""Fanatic"", ""Whisful Thinking"", ""Music"" (this woman really loves what she does!) and ""Keep on Goin"". However the other songs are just wonderful too! Fantastic, I'm a fanatic hihi!Vivian is you read this: I want you to always keep on going, your music comes straight from your soul and it touches me! Lots of artists and music today doesn't touch you no more, you make real music! Hope you come to Holland soon to perform. I'm your number 1 fan! Keep on going girl!!!"
3,I love her!!!!,"I must admite but to me even though that emotional coaster song is good but the best song on her cd is FINAL HOUR hands down. But i know shes gonna come with a better album with even more ballads about heartbreak, But i must say she must of just came out of a relationship cause you can just hair the pain in her voice in the song Final Hour. I cant wait until he new cd comes out she is truely a singer not like fakers who have a record deal like ms hilary duff, I truely believe she deserves to be in the list next to Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston & kelly Clarkson."
4,"Great Work, not to be overlooked","This CD was great, from an up and coming artist that may get lost in the shuffle of the entire ""neo-soul"" movement. She has a Jazzy sound and tracks that become better with each listen. I definately recommend this CD...it will be well worth it!!"
4,Good Debut,Good songs and great voice. I didn't like only one song. Nice to hear a new R&B voice that doesn't feel she has to have a hip hop rapper guest.
3,...maybe it's me...,"maybe i've heard too much music... maybe it's the head-cold i have... or maybe i jus dont get it... this woman has an excellent voice (as many artists nowadays!), but i am not overwhelmed... i havent seen her live in concert as many other reviewers have so i dont have that as a guide, but jus going on her cd, three stars is all i'm feelin... this is a good release, in the same vein as heather headley - obviously these women are destined to be the next 'big thang', but when you release your best track for your first single it feels like a let down to listen to the rest of the cd......or... maybe it's jus me... :P"
4,Miss Soul Sistah 2003,"I was too busy playing ""Emotional Rollercoaster"" over and over that I totally ignored her other songs. I was in one of my moods one morning and I started playing her cd and WOW!!! Her voice is incredible and you really feel something when u liten to this cd. My favs are:1. Aint Nothin But Love2. No sittin by the phone3.Superwoman4.Emotional Rollercoaster5.Be Good to you"
2,another just there Neo-Soul Album&Artist,"tired of Neo-Soul Artists because after a while you heard 10 you have heard 100&this set is no different.Vivian Green is talented but pretty much a dime a dozen vocalist&artist.""Emotional Rollercoaster"" was catchy but not much after that holds my attention."
1,"Fast forward, slow reverse. Broke after 4 flights.","Got this for my Syma S107g as a replacement rear rotor. It was suggested for it's increased forward speed.For forward movement, it worked great!...at the expense of nearly all reverse movement. Going backward was painfully slow.Then after 4 flights one blade had a crack nearly through the whole thing. The next flight, the blade broke off.I'm glad I bought the 2 pack rather than the 4 pack.These things are fragile."
3,Replacement Tail Props,"Again I purchased as spares,and have'nt needed them yet,but I'm sure they will work out fine.BIGEMANN"
3,Air Hogs Havoc Heli Replacement Props,"I have already had to use one of these. The fragility of these parts is shocking. My kids love the toys, but they probably won't last long."
2,Extra Props Needed!,THis helicopter is too fine and product for kids...can't really trip the props to get it to fly up or in any intended direction....need extra props as they tear if impacted hard!
1,Not impressed,Finally got these replacement blades in the mail today. I have to different kinds of helicopters. These blades did NOT work on either. Quite upset.
3,Good value.,We really did not need these because the helicopter wore out before the props. We did not need these because the body of the helicopter fell apart.
2,The hole is too small for my needs,I bought this for a 2009 havoc heli...I know...why try to restore a 2009 havoc heli...anyway...took a lot more work than I wanted to put into it...
2,disappoiinted,This machine bubbles but they are anything but quiet. the water was cold in less than 2 minutes even though i put hot water in has per the instructions. A bucket would probally have done better along with air pump from my fish tank.
1,Heavy and awkward,"I got this product as a gift for my sister, she used it once and doesn't want to bother dragging it out again."
1,Not so hot,"The bubbles are great, but the heater does not even keep really hot water warm. The water cooled down to cold in about 5 minutes."
1,"Fascinating Subject, Talentless Author","When I quickly thumbed through ""The Vampire Killers"", I couldn't wait to read it as homicides and vampires are two of the subjects I find to be the most fascinating. Sadly, I was extremely disappointed. Don't get me wrong -- the idea of a teenage vampire cult leader is startling, beyond wicked -- but Linedecker, being the talentless oaf that he is, managed to bore me half to death with his uninspiring, unmoving content. Thankfully, there are other authors out there who manage to do a decent job of writing about the stories that Linedecker ruins all together. If you'd like an interesting view of the Wendorf murders, then ditch this book and read ""The Embrace"" by Aphrodite Jones instead."
1,Worthless,"A big waste of time. There is nothing on this dvd that can't be learned through research on the internet. Russo, especially, seems much more intent on ""selling"" his trash novels and movies rather than instructing others as how to do make a movie. Terrible waste of money."
3,Informative but a tad bit dated,John Russo's Filmmaking Seminar is a very interesting and informative look at low budget filmmaking. If you want a quick overview about how to start making your own movie this is a good start. Some of the information here is dated but I would recommend it for any amateur filmmaker.
1,Doomsayer does not convince in the long run,"I remembered The Late, Great Planet Earth and its tie-in feature release from the late seventies, when Apocalypse fever was sweeping the nation in the wake of The Omen and related Anti-Christ lookalike thrillers. So I thought, after reading Left Behind and a few of its sequels, I would read a little more about it. Mr. Lindsey's literal readings of the prophecies are interesting at first, but soon become rather silly as he tries to explain the unexplainable. It did not convince me, I should have stayed with the direct source, the Bible."
1,Awful,"The service was great and fast, the product is just awful, doesn't work at all. Don't buy this, don't waste your money!"
1,Too big for me,I should have trusted the reviews but I had read mixed reviews all over. I am a size 4 or 6 and this thing is huge on me. I put it on the tightest setting and it did absolutely nothing for me. I am bummed because I was really looking forward to using it. Do not buy if you are smaller than a size 6.
1,Pffft !!,"One size fits all, eh? Not if your 5'10"" and 250 lbs +. Tis what i get for going the cheap $ route in finding relief from mid-upper back ache. Will keep looking for sumthin else.This item is also coming from a company that has product packaging stating machine washable{online ad states it also}, while a tag on item states hand wash only. If i had known this i woulda stayed away from a company that cant keep facts straight.I rated item 1*, has good potential as a sling shot. Albeit a pricey one."
3,does what it says,"The piece works well with holding you back, the only problem I hadis that it rubs under my arms"
1,PLEASE DO NOT waste your time and money!!!,"I bought this as a gift for my wife, and was literally appologizing a minute after we opened it (and quickly returning it to Amazon too). It looks WAY more promising than it really is - you can't even call it a massager - first it's gigantic, plain uncomfortable, doesn't not fit right around the neck, and buzzes the heck out of you when you turn it on - NOT relaxing at all. Umm did I say enough - I think so - save yourself a headache (literally), don't go for this one."
4,Not that bad...,"I took my chances despite the other reviews, and am so far enjoying it. It's not as bad as the other reviewers say, you just have to lean against it. You can't just put it on and sit up in a chair - it works best when you're leaning back on it, more like a neck rest. It's not disruptive, either - in fact, I am using it right now! It's not loud enough to drown out the TV. All in all, it's a HUGE improvement over trying to use other massagers not designed specifically for the neck."
2,Don't recommend,"Having other HoMedics massaging devices, I expected massage and not vibration from this unit. I also expected that it would conform to my neck, but it does not. It is stiff. As stated in another review, it works best if you lean into it. Better than nothing for a stiff neck, but not great at all."
1,Totally dissapointed,I bought this item because i sit in the computer all day and wanted to get some relief. The vibrating noise is way too loud (close to your ears) and the intensity of the vibration almost non-existent. I would gladly return this product but it is hardly woth the trouble because of the mailing cost (bulky item).
1,One spot only neck vibrator,"A waste of money. I assumed because it wrapped around my neck, that it would massage around my neck. It only ""vibrates"" in one spot behind my neck. Also, because it is bulky and does not fit snuggly around my neck(sits on shoulders), I do not notice any heat. I tried to give this away but it was returned. We dropped off at a local donation site."
2,practically useless,"Sound like a cool idea, but it's ineffective; the heater is more effective than the vibration"
1,Useless!,Awkward to use and barely any result. I returned it promptly to Walgreen. Total waste of time.
1,Completely worthless,"This product does not do anything whatsoever to even slightly massage. Your pet cat would do a better job. If you need a massage, go to a professional."
5,this book is top class reading,"amazing book, well written i enjoyed every minute of it. this book is definately one everyone should own."
1,Not compatible with all Kindles,Purchased three Caillou books only to find out my inexpensive kindle can't receive these books. One unhappy 3 1/2 year old boy!
3,"I really like Hans Zimmer, but...","Where is Jack singing, ""Always look on the Bright Side of Life""? Why was he recorded for all of time on the ""Something's Gotta Give"" soundtrack, but couldn't be for this one? He needs to cut a full CD."
1,Not gonna buy used again...,"Caught my alltime favorite movie (As Good As It Gets) on TV recently and got a bug to purchase the soundtrack. Not many new copies available given the age of this movie, so I settled for a used copy of the CD. BIG MISTAKE. Most of the tracks are not accessible at all - the ones that are skip and slip. Don't think there's even one piece that plays through smoothly..."
2,As good as it gets,Condition of jewel case poor - it was cracked. I would have thought the seller could have supplied a new one ! The sleeve was stained in several places.I don't think this was mentioned in the description of the produce before sale.
2,About as Bad as It Gets,"Big disappointment, since the movie was so good. Where is Van Morrison's Days Like This???"
3,Be sure you know what you are getting.,"This soundtrack has some nice songs/tunes. It DOES NOT include any of the ""oldies"" Melvin plays on the road trip. Not a bad CD but not awesome either."
2,As Good As It Gets: Music from the Motion Picture,Only a few good songs. Few songs were like elevator music. No James Morrison. I bought it cheap so I am glad I didn't spend a lot of money for it.
4,Always look on the bright side of life,I purchased the CD because I wanted to song and lyrics to Monty Python's Always look on the bright side of life.
1,It had no effect at all!,"Not only it had no effect on me, it seem my appetite increased. I followed the instructions to have 2 capsules 1 hour before meals, but it still didn't work."
1,This is a SCAM!!,Product made me so sick I had to go to the hospital-its loaded with caffeine. I am so UNHAPPY!
3,quality not there,"Hi, I exspected new and it was clearly opened and then resealed would not use them any more because they lie"
4,Early Semat text,"The book received was, as expected, the revised 3rd edition first published in 1954, not the later edition shown in the figure. I personally used this edition in the Atomic and Nuclear Physics Course at UC Berkeley in 1955. At that time the only other clear Atomic Physics book was one written by Max Born. The Semat book starts at a level that assumes college level general physics. The explanations are clear, the histories of various discoveries are clear but brief. Math required is algebra and simple calculus. Derivations are numerous and most of the problems at the ends of the chapters have answers. I still find that its explanations of early experiments in Atomic Physics are crisp and interestingly presented. This 3rd edition was too early for the discovery of quarks, quantum electrodynamics and other areas of modern nuclear physics. What it does do it does well."
3,"One is bust, Two is better","Egypt 1 had nice graphics, but the logic of play was fuzzy and the storyline erratic. The final puzzle was extremely confusing and I was forced to go to a walkthrough to solve it. I would not recommend the game.Egypt 2 was quite a bit better. The organization was better, some of the puzzles more interesting and the graphics excellent. The navigation has considerably better as well. I did have trouble with one puzzle that has solved by downloading the patch."
3,"Not the same as the band ""Moth"" -- oops","I accidentally purchased this album due to a search I did for a band that is actually called ""Moth"". Honestly, this wasn't the album I was looking for, but, I'll admit, I kind of like it.This is basically ""chill out"" music. Good for background during ... or ..... something. Hope that helps"
1,Like a school project,"Smaltzy, simple, stilted, short. I went into this thinking it was a real movie. Instead it reminded me of a high school project, or at best, like a film they might show at a church social."
4,Right For The Money,"I've had this cd for as long as I can remember and love it. Some compilations want $30 and up for a Wagner opera, but this has it all condensed into one cd and it's both beautiful and inexpensive."
2,Ick.,"In my opinion, this book, Ironman by Chris Crutcher was really stupid. I dislike his style of writing. I tried to like it, and I tried to get into this book but I ended up putting the book down only after the fifth chapter. What I do like about Chris Crutcher, is his strong female characters. I wouldn't recommend this book."
1,Not for 5th Grade,This book was rated 5.5 by Accelerated Reader -- 5th grade. Hello?! This book is full of foul -- obscene and lewd -- language. Who labeled this book 5th grade? Totally inappropriate for Middle School 10-14 year olds.
2,Not for the literate child.,"The language used by the author in my opinion is vulgar and not necessary to tell his tale. It teaches that rude and crude behavior is accepted in the struggle to succeed. Rather than encourage foul language as the norm, Crutcher should try to educate by using BIG words himself rather than resort to base and inferior words to make his characters seem hip - cool doesn't cut it when it comes to learning proper words and how to use them.Johanna Stephens"
5,Really great book!,"This book was extremely interesting! I was so absorbed in it, that I finished it the day after I found it! I am really glad I did find it, and am sorry I even hesitated to read it in the first place. Crutcher puts you right in Bo's shoes, and you feel like you have to stand by him right until the last words."
5,Ironman,"This is an Increadible book that deals with teen problems along with finding ways to deal with them. It's characters deal with backstabbing, Love and learn about the powerful bonds of true friendship that are so very rare and wonderful in the world today. It is a terrific book that I would recommend to people that like teen issue books, books that show a lot of feeling."
5,Great Book!,I read this book for English class and I didn't think I'd like it at all. Turns out I love the book. Once I got started I wanted to keep reading on. Beaus father was mean to him when he had to be in his room for several months. If I could recommend a book to someone this would be one of them. Its great!
4,Excellent Audio-Book - Not just for teenagers,"I had the pleasure of listening to this book on tape recently. The narrative was enhanced by having one reader narrate Bo's letters to Larry King and another reader narrate the other parts of the story. It worked very well and brought the listener into Bo's thoughts and feelings about growing up as a teenager in a dysfunctional family.Not having been a teenager for many years (but having 2 of my own), I found it to be honest and realistic. There are so many instances of rage in today's world -- Anger Management class seems to be a great form of therapy for high school students who can't control their rage. While Bo doesn't quite show his rage in a physically destructive way, his life is enhanced by the people and mentors he meets while attending Anger Management.Highly recommend this book."
4,Interesting on many levels,This novel addresses so many issues that teens face today. The way the relationships between the characters develop keeps the reader hooked page after page. This is a good one for reluctant male readers with average or above reading skills.
4,For teens who have had problems and overcome them...,"This book, as many people have stated, is about teen angst and a young man training for a modified triathalon. Bo is the young man in this book and the books starts with him telling his coach to take a flying leap (in not so many words!). For his actions he's told he has to attend Mr. Naks anger management class every morning. At first he thinks this is a bunch of losers, but over time he begins to think differently of them.Overall a great book. If you've read Stotan by Crutcher you'll notice some characters from that book in this book. I enjoyed seeing what happened to one of the characters in Stotan. I'll be looking for another Crutcher book shortly!"
5,VERY GOOD.,"P DOES IT AGAINbest lp since DA LAST DONonly god can judge me, ghetto postage and gameface were alright but this is back to the ghetto d days...WHEN IS CURRENCY PUTTING A CD OUT..NO LIMIT NEEDS TO PUT OUT ANOTHER SILKK CD AS WELL"
1,Painful to listen to,"I started bumpin P when he came out with Ice Cream Man, and he was my favorite rapper for quite some time. Everything before ""Da Last Don"" is classic material, but isht hit the fan when Percy tried to imitate John Gotti. Beats By the Pound, evidently sensed the wackness and smashed out. Instead of sticking with his ""last"" album, P treaded even further up ishts creek by imitating ""current trends"" (e.g. ""whodi,"" ""them jeans""--blatant lil jon rip) in his newer releases. This cd is a disgrace and Master P has become rap history's ALL TIME WORST SELL-OUT. After making an arse out of himself trying to play in the NBA, Master P released the laughable ""Only God Can Judge Me."" Nowadays Percy pimps his son, whose is nothing more than a Lil Bow-Wow wannabe. Ironically, Three 6 Mafia has been making records just as long, but their sound hasn't changed much since their 1994 classic debut, Mystic Stylez."
5,Classic after Classic,I have had this album since it was released..and being the hip hop fan i am...and when something is released and i see people sleepin on an artist that ...has put in work 10 times what these rookies have and stil contiunes to put out underground classics..and has sold 80 million plus records with nolimit records...he didnt slip nor has he ever fallen off ...from start to finish this album is...dope...just listen to it and buy it....and BUY THE GHETTO BILL GATES>>>>>>THE TRU KING OF THE SOUF get off the bandwagons and buy this southern hip hop at its finest degree...ya heard me.....free c-murder...
3,"Not Spectacular, Not bad","Where do I start. This album is basically a filler album. There were really no standouts except for 20's On Cars 26's On Trucks. Granted the album is not that lackluster, it is nothing to boast about having.To have a track with C-Murder rapping over the phone is truly disgusting, No Limit (or the New No Limit) has truly fell off beyond recognition.To those who gave this album 4 to 5 stars, listen again and you might be surprised"
1,Admit it,"Master P has jocked every one from Cash Money, ""Hot Boys movie,etc."" Outkast, ""Hootie Hoo,"" and now Lil Jon ""those Jeans."" Can you blame him. For someone who owns a record label without any talent as well as having no talent himself, bitting is his only resort. Being from Louisiana, we have officially disowned him before the release of this album. Don't nobody wear P. Miller clothing. All it does is jock other clothing labels. Everyone knows No Limit filed bankrupcy before, and if they keep releasing stuff like this, they better put their attorneys on speed dial. Alternative suggestions (if you want to get the real deal and not the fake) includes Lil' Wayne ""The Carter"" Outkast ""any album"" Big Tymers ""Big Money Heavyweight"" Lil' Jon... ""Kings of Crunk"" Pastor Troy ""Universal Soldier""""By Any Means Necessary."" I guess there is a limit to No Limit: they continue to cross it, album after album."
2,WHAT!,"This Album Has Got To Be a damn joke, this legendary rapper who put music flooded with bass on the map, has gone an replicated everybody's work. I Mean the name of the tracks are a joke :Act a Fool (ludacris), We all We Got (derrty ent.) Man I gave this dude 2 stars for two songs act a fool and 20 on cars 26 on trucks."
2,old and weak,No disrepect 2 p but he suck now he used 2 be str8 gutta and real now he takin his gold out 2 get on da nickoloaden channel.
1,Another Piece of South Crap,"I really do not understand why this guy has a career other than smart marketing and stupid customers. I have never been impressed by anyone affiliated with No limit aka No talent records but this one is really special. Entertaining or embarassing for him to make his first two singles both rip offs, Jeans? yeah ginuwine did it better and then act a fool with him hopping like a retard but ludacris killed that track. I shows why americans are consumed by consumerism for you to actually have a market for his crap. If you want hollow rap with no skillz or talent or anything buy this but if you want a real good new album cop Ghostface Killa Pretty toney album"
1,MANE HE STILL BITE'N PAC ZzzZ,MANE ANYTHING GOES IS A RIP OF WHEN WE RIDE ON OR ENIMIES..YEARS LATTER AND HES STILL BITE'n DOWN WITH HIS STOLEN JAWS
1,Lil' P !!!,"ok..wtf? first P a straight out OG rapper like snoop and dre, now that, that gangsat s--- is not the style of the day, he wants to refere himself as the second Lil Jon? first of all his tryin' to make his voice deeper liek lil' jon, 2nd of all all the song are ripped staright outta ""Kings of crunk"", and wtf is that ""act a fool"" video? why does that Naked guy keep grabbin' master P and what the f--- is P doing in front of his cadillac? C-walkin'? A-town walkin'? or NO walk? if he is then he desperetly needs somelesson, bad, cuz that's just plain stupid, they guy is just makin' fun of himself!"
1,Master P is a F*cking Fa*got,"Holy s*it, P is the biggest rip off of all time: he copies everyone Lil jon, 2pac, and almost every other rap star, the only difference is he sounds like my a** after i get indigestion, this album is a disgrace to rap music and all you stupid f*cks who gave it a good review must have your head up your A** because you havent heard this Bulls*it! when i saw the video for them jeans i started laughing my a** off because it looked like my 2yr old brother had tried to copy lil jon but failed to look the least bit hardcore! Dont buy this peice of s*it! Master P is a worse poser than lil romeo!"
5,MAKIN' A COMEBACK!,"This is no doubt Master P's best album effort since MP Da Last Don. He's takin' it back to the old P but he threw in some of the new club bangers like ""Them Jeans"" and ""It's a Drought"". No album has been as good as this one since Beats By the Pound was around and that's been a long time. Ya'll gotta pick up this album. P's credibilty has been tarnished but with a lil help from all of us he'll be back on top."
4,master p's best album for years--4.5 STARS,"""Goodside/Badside"" is Master P's newest album. It features the hits ""Act A Fool"" featuring Lil' Jon, ""Who Want Some"" and ""Them Jeans"". This is a double disc album with 24 songs in total. It also comes with a DVD featuring Master P and Lil' Romeo's new movie titled ""Goodside/Badside"" (If you buy the limited edition version). The first disc all the songs are good. The second disc has a few strong tracks (""Tell 'Em"", ""Ghetto Model"", ""Ghetto Honey"", ""If"" & ""We Like Them Girls""), but the other songs on disc 2 are average. Overall I give this album a 4.5/5, and think that this album is definitely worth buying."
5,Who Want Some!!!? P is Still Bout it,"OMFG, when I heard P dropped a new CD I knew I had to get it, especially since its been 3yrs since his last one, But When I went to the store I was kinda disappointed that the CD was $25(Canadian)(with DVD) but i got it anyways and I'm glad I did. These songs pound the F*cK outta my subs and there are so many good songs: ""We All We Got""""Who Want Some""""why they wanna wish Death""""Them Jeans""20's on Cars 26 on Trucks""...The DVD aint the greatest but the soundtrack Is cuz Every song on it is from the CD. The end of the dvd with Why they wanna wish death music video is my fav part.If you have any intrest in Master P WHATSOEVER buy this CD you wont be dissapointed!"
4,Finally!,"I am not what you would call a big Master P fan. But I can tell you this, this album by far is the best album P has put out since Ghetto D.The hottest tracks on here in my opinion would be: Act a fool Feat. Lil Jon,Who want some,Let 'em go, That ain't nothing and the hottest joint Who demm Boyz feat. Lil Jon. Yo go cop the album its hot."
1,Bulls*hit is Contagious,"Stop sucking each other's d*icks, this album is trash-don't even touch it. Of course I want P to make a return and to come back hard like he was on Ice Cream Man and Ghetto D, but this s*hit disk just doesn't do it. Sleep on this s*hit cause it sucks, sleep a long, long time-you know what, why don't u go into hibernation."
5,A Classic Album,Ok first off I am tired of everyone hating on Master P. You may not have liked Gameface but this album it a classic. Master P comes off hard on every track. If you don't have this album you should go buy it because its hot. If you hurry up and buy it you can get your free Dvd which is a full feature movie. (...) Go buy the New P album you won't be disspointed. Much Luv Peace
4,WOULD B BETTER IF HE DIDNT BITE PAC,"ITS A NICE CD BUT A LOT OF PPL KNOW THAT MASTER P IS A PAC BITER, DID NE BODY NOT NOTICE THAT HE COMPLETELY STOLE ""ANYTHING GOES"" FROM TUPACS ""WHEN WE RIDE ON OUR ENEMIES""?? CHECK IT OUT...BUT NE WAY ITS A GOOD CD FOR WUT ITS WORTH BUT ARTISTS SHOULD STOP RIPPIN PAC, P HAS HIS OWN NO LIMIT STYLE NOW HE NEEDS HIS OWN LYRICS...i admit he did a nice job REMIXING ""when we ride on our enemies""..."
4,Alright Comeback,"Yo it was kool, tha tank made a little comeback on here.Look i'll tell you,Ghetto D was better,but this is better than Da Last Don.Remember P always use to bite Pac's music,he does it alittle on one song Anything Goes,but he made the song good.Highlights are the 1st song Act A Fool,Number 4 is off tha hook.On Who Dem Boys C-Murder verse was alright from the pen,but the new girl Liberty was tight.The last two songs on the 2nd disc were tight,If was real tight.Ion know,Curren$y is tight to me but P got him sounding like Ma$e & Fabulous alittle.And Lil Romeo was off tha chain on here,hope P dont still write his rap.But if they had a song like Pass Me Da Green,or Burbons & Lacs but better, the album wouldve been the best."
5,Finally>>>,"This pewter piece I ordered back in June, it didn't arrive until the very last day it was required to, 3-1/2 wks later. Although it was in perfect condition, I don't believe I should've had to ask where it was several times. Don't like the seller, like the item."
2,Mexican Train Disappointment,"The 10 trains I received did not seem to be a set. Three of them were made of a clearer plastic, and one of those was a brownish tint with glitter. Of the seven solid trains I received that look like the trains in the picture above, three were a shade of blue, and two were a shade of pink. I assumed there would be more variety and the trains would all at least be made of the same type of plastic. I had planned to give them as a gift and was unable to because of these inconsistencies."
5,Just as ordered,The additional trains I ordered for the Mexican Train domino set were received very quickly. they are very colorful. I would recommend to a friend
3,Very useful,"They are indespensable accesories to the Mexican train domino. We really needed them, so as to play the game with more than 4 people.(Before obtaining them we used....beans...)"
4,Short changed,The product description indicated that the seller will ship 10 trains but I only received 9. I won't buy or recommend this seller.
4,Great addition for the Dominoes G,"An inexpensive addition to the Dominoes game. It is easy to incorporate with the game, and easily allows up to six people to participate with enjoyment."
3,train additiion,These little trains were a great addition to the ones that came with my Mexican train game - allows for more players.
5,I love Ghana!,"I love Anthony Bourdain and I love Ghana! I would recommend everyone visiting this beautiful country with all its wonderful people! I bought this after I came back from Ghana to remind me of Ghana, but wish I had seen it before I left because now I want to go back and see all the places in the show I didn't get to go to!!!"
5,Another Winner,"I admit--I'm a fan of Michele Dunaway's works. This one, though, is one of her best.Take one matchmaking grandfather, two business people with career aspirations who are in each other's way, and you have a romance that sizzles. The dialogue is fast and witty, and Megan is the perfect match for Harry Sanders, the CEO's grandson.As a reader, I was delighted to see Darci and Cameron O'Brien back for a few scenes as they help Harry and Megan along the stormy, but satisifying road to love.A keeper."
3,"Great Episodes, Bad Tape","This is a review of this product:Extreme Ghostbusters Vol. 1-3 VHS. Amazon may display this review on the page of another version of this product, for which this review may not apply. After reading this review, please click on the link so that you can be assurred that the product this review applies to is the same one you thought it was for.--------------------------------------------------While the Extreme Ghostbusters series is top-notch, this video falls below average because it was recorded in the SLP/EP speed - which is usually reserved for those ""low budget"" $3.99 tapes you find on the discount rack at your local supermarket. To make matters worse, Columbia/Tristar Home Video doesn't even tell you on the video box that it was recorded in this speed. Anyway, the episodes are at least worth the money spent on this tape. (Maybe we can all pray that they release this on DVD.)"
1,A travesty,"Take a really fun cartoon show like The Real Ghostbusters, cut out all of the major characters except one, and add ""extreme"" to the title for no reason other than a bunch of 50-year-old TV execs deciding that the word ""extreme"" makes a show sound cooler to 10-year-olds (which it doesn't). What is the result? Something incredibly stupid.I want my Venkman and Ray, darn it, not these ""extreme"" losers!"
3,Good for small jobs,"I was looking for the dropper I used to make muffins with in the bakery. This thing is MUCH smaller.It would take me more time than what its worth. My own mistake, look at the quantity it holds before you buy!!!Its not worth me sending it back either."
3,weird and remarkably strange,"although l think this film is really weird and funny, seen several times. because hugo weaving. incredibly silly and l hated yahoo serious's voice.."
5,This movie is awesome!,"Quite simply, this movie is awesome. It's a very fun comedy if you silly but awesome comedies. So watch it."
5,better packaging,"the article I purchased was what I ordered, and down the track, it was going to be an article of collectibility, but due to the way it was packed, it was damaged in transit (i have already notified buyersbks). unless absolutely necessary, i will not be using your service or your clients service."
3,sara jane,"It's a good solid performance of both the New World symphony and the Moldau, my criticism is with the recording itself. The opening of the first movement is so quiet that in order to hear it you have to crank the volume. Then of course it gets very loud, very fast -- nearly blowing out the speakers. I got it for the Moldau. (Honestly, if I had remembered this problem, I would have got a different recording altogether.)"
5,Stunning.,"Although this was the point in Karajan's career where he recently left the Berliner and went to Wiener and was trying to ""bust out"" as many digital recordings of his previous works and recordings, it is a great interpretation. The sound from this recording is absolutely phenomenal. Although my favorite recording of this symphony is Fritz Reiner with Chicago, the sound on this particular recording is outstanding. The way he takes the first movement slower in comparison really brings out the true quality of the movement. Great recording, would recommend for anyone's collection."
2,"Hotel Collection Classic White Mug, Set of 4","The mugs were ok, but the original price is questionable. They were fairly priced on sale. I suspect that the price drop was because they couldn't sell them at the original price. Price stickers were extremely hard to remove. Be prepared with at least heavy a duty cleaning pad and maybe some alcohol or other solvent to clean off the labels. After spending about a half an hour a cup, and going through two cleaning pads to remove the lables, I would have not have been happy paying the full price for them."
1,Old Macy's overstock?,"These are OK mugs for a couple dollars each.But I don't know what makes them ""Rosenthal"" as the bottom is marked ""Hotel Collection by Charter Club, Classic White, Made in Germany, .... Federated Department Stores, Inc."" - aka, Macy's - Charter Club is one of their in-house brands.And even that wouldn't be so bad, if I could get the blasted adhesive from the tags off the side of the mug. Soaking, dishwashing, rubbing alcohol - no luck."
3,Arrived in Pieces,"The cups are GREAT, perfect size and all. Only reason I gave this item three stars is because this set of four became a set of three after it arrived. The packaging was not the best and one of the cups was shattered in half. I had contacted amazon customer service for a replacement but sadly they were out of stock (they did offered me a refund though, but I ended up keeping it)."
1,Not much bang for the buck.,"This book is _not_ for those who are seeing Montreal for the first time. It does offer a few non-touristy ideas but many secrets aren't that unusual, the organization is lazy, and it's tiny at 160pp. The Ulysses Guide for Montreal (with its extensive walking tours) was way more useful to me as a tourist."
4,Abuelos Clasicos,"Me encantan los Abuelos de La Nada. Le hubiera dado 5 estrellas de no ser porque falla la disquera en notificar al comprador que varios de los temas incluidos en el disco son ""En Directo"" que aunque son originales y muy buenas yo compre el album pensando que eran versiones ""studio"". Fuera de eso, pura rumba con Los Abuelos."
5,great story,"""Home is the nicest word there is."" These are Laura Ingalls' sweet and touching words that help kick off the ""Little House on the Prairie"" video series in ""A Harvest of Friends."" The Ingalls family has decided to settle at Plum Creek in Walnut Grove. Pa builds a house for the family, and they are all happy there. Pa starts working for two men named Mr. Hanson and Mr. O'Neil to ensure that he can earn the supplies he needs for his harvest. Mr. Hanson is a kind and caring man, but Mr. O'Neil is pushy and unrelenting. So, when Pa falls out of a tree at a family picnic and is ordered off to bed, you could probably guess which one of those two men is understanding and which one refuses to cut Pa any slack. I was very touched when the title of this video came to life and presented itself so beautifully at the end. This is a good one--I give it 5 stars and I definitely recommend it."
3,"Decent, but could follow the books more.","Having read the John Norman series, I would have hoped this movie would follow more closely to the orignal plot and details than it actually did. The delicate workings of Gorean society have been squelched and warped into a more typical fantasy setting, until they are no longer recognizable. While it has some merit, or maybe just sentimental value for fans of the original series, this movie version of Gor has lost the uniqueness present in the books."
2,Gor story re-arranged to fit Sword & Sorcery label,"The Gor stories were never literary classics, but they were never meant to be. Something else they were not meant to be were Sword and Sorcery as they are depicted in this film. If all you are looking for is the ""dirty bits"" then that's all you'll see. If all that is wanted by the director is skimpily clad women, THAT'S all you'll see. You do NOT have to be into S&M to be fascinated by the cut and thrust world of Gor, something the puritans out there cannot seem to understand. Unfortunately, it is something the filmmakers didn't understand either. One final comment. Whoever it was that armed women with swords in the film, and showed them beating down the swords of men twice their size in battle has made little effort to follow the Chronicles of Gor.... nor have they ever held a sword!"
2,I should have been arrested!,"I should have been arrested for spending while stupid; bad costuming, bad sets, cheap film. Did they just drive out to Baja(or wherever) and film in the sand on the weekend? The book author John Norman must have really needed money to sell his story to this studio. Incidentally, they must have had a film budget of a dollar ninety-eight. The saving grace was some good acting (stressing some) and the beautiful women. Yes I've seen the second one too! See my review in ""Outlaw of Gor"". My wife tells me I write with an acid pen, well see the movie and find out. But RENT don't BUY!"
2,the movie is one of the worst ever made,if you want to see a bad movies there's not to much out there worst then this. If ever someone did an auther injustes they did on this one. all i can say is watch it. then get the book and read it over and dream that some one can do one better. where's G.L.or S.S. or even R.H. were are the great ones when there's agreat story to be told.
2,Shoddy rip-off of the book series,"The book series by John Norman made much use of sexual and erotic images of muscular dominating men and subserviant women - the kind of world most men long for. Unfortunately, the movie producers decided to forego all that and just use the name ""Gor"" and wrap it up in a very bad plot. It looks like the screenwriter tried to follow the basic plot of the books - the slavery and class roles of the characters are evident - but somewhere along the lines the producers mucked everything up with Christian ""morals"" (no nudity, little violence) and toned down Norman's statement about society. The result was a waste of a movie that once had potential.My advice: read the books and hope the producers of the next film get it right."
2,"the films, like the books, they are really bad","altough the director has done a lot with the poooor material, he still diesn't manage to salvage what is esentially a sick and barbaric ideal, attractive to a few deranged individuals who pick up on the sex aspect and probably rewind and replay the 'dirty' bits over and over while getting their 'real man' to whoop thier butts. It is porn for those who think they are above that kind of thing. Please email me if you have a view on this"
3,"Good camera, Expensive for what you get!","The camera is pretty good, but you cannot see at night with it. You must buy an IR kit from the company to use in the dark. Should be included with starter kit. Also if you want to use the pan, tilt, zoom you must upgrade the software to Platinum version for $[...] per year fee. Pretty sad, they include features that you cannot use unless you upgrade and pay them for as long as you use the system. It says its wireless, but not really because you have to plug the power adapter into it. Must have an outlet close by. I bought the system from Costco which included 2 cameras for $[...], I took it back the next day because you can get a 4 cam system that works a lot better for that price.Wilife DVS800I LukWerks Indoor Starter Kit"
4,A great system for the price,"I've used several cameras in the last few years in an attempt to come up with some type of cheap home security system. After trying out the Wilife system, I have to say that it's the best option I've come across under the $500 range. The video quality is excellent, and the best part is, the motion detector on the camera works perfectly, even through windows, which most of the other cameras I've used can't handle. Setup took less than 20 minutes and I didn't have to deal with port forwarding or spend hours trying to configure my router to get it to work. I was also able to view the camera online very easily from a remote location.My only problem with the camera is that the actual camera is way too big in my opinion, and I didn't really like the mounting options. I wanted to put one of the cameras in my ceiling and angle it through a hole in the ceiling so it was undetectable, but the unit is so big that is impossible. Otherwise, I'm very satisfied."
1,the power supply for the indoor cam has design problem (you lucky if you have 4 months use of it),"I'll update this if their customer service will get back to me. I've been holding for more than 25 minutes now. This is not a company worth dealing with. The customer service group responds quickly but nothing was given except they told me that they knew it is a problem with their power supply!!! So this guy know it is a problem, instead of given RMA number, he give me the number for tech support. 877-585-9397 option 2... 25m and I give up. Time to find a retail store that sell this and do a swap."
2,"Can't view on ""your"" web site","Not worth the money.Very easy to install.Can't plug the cameras into a power strip or ups.You can't upload to ""your"" web site.You can only upload to ""their"" web site.This makes these cameras almost useless.Not a good picture quality.Great that the cameras are ""inside"" your home looking out of the window so they can not be messed with. Bad you can't up load the video to ""your own"" web site.If you have no desire to view your cameras over the web, and you don't need power strips or ups great buy.If you want to view your cameras over the web or need power strips don't buy these cameras."
1,Defective Hardware,"Great idea. When it works it's excellent. I bought fourteen cameras for home and office. Of the fourteen I returned, I think, four within the first year. They replaced them. By the end of the second year only six of the eighteen are working. The outdoor cameras are worse than the indoor cameras. They will not honor a warranty after a year. They could have a great product but their hardware is extremely shoddy. I also bought a desktop camera. It doesn't work either, in that you cannot change set the time. Save your money. Buy a DVR system, it's cheaper in the long run."
3,OK but clunky and customer service is a challenge,"OK systems. Very clunky with issues regularly. My biggest complaint is customer service. You have to do a million things before they help you and that's mostly on email. Need all sorts of ""proof"" like receipts, forms, etc before they will assist. Make sure you keep all those documents. I'm having issues now with one of my cameras and they won't help because I can't find this one receipt after 2 years.....geez."
2,hardware failure during power outage,"The software is adequate, it certainly works once you learn the interface. I had a system with one camera running for 1.5 years and added 2 more cameras about 10 months ago.I just had a power outage in my house, and unfortunately the original camera is now fried - both the wall power line converter and the camera itself are dead. The problem is that the wall plug cannot be plugged into a surge suppressor, so your stuck trusting the devices ability to handle line noise. Apparently, not so good at it.My low rating is mainly due to the price and robustness, when you spend this much on a camera you expect it to be well designed. Failing due a lightning strike I can understand, but this was no such event. In retrospect, my recommendation would be to buy a more professionally designed unit that is not susceptible to power line noise. With 3 cameras, I've already spent over $500; that would purchase a much higher end unit then this one."
5,fabulous fondue set,"This is just the BEST fondue set!! I loved my first one so much, I bought this one so I could have two!!! You will not be disappointed!!! Simply the best!"
2,pinch of salt,"As mentioned earlier, this book can seem to easy to knock because of its veneration by the wide eyed and uncool. I recommend this book for travel information, ie buses, trains, etc., for the first time visitor. I disrecommend it for its recommendations of hotels and eateries. India is a land overflowing with places to stay and eat, and those mentioned in this book are full of aforementioned hordes of the 'uncool', and correpondingly overpriced.I also disrecommend it because info on local points of interest leave a littleto be desired, the tone of the authors is often a little smug, and by buying this book you are funding the ruination of hard found havens by the unwashed hippy masses. But I suppose that's inevitable."
2,"Good Quality, but problems occurred on the way.","The quality of the plates are better than what i had expected. The problem occurred during shipping. The plated are not well protected during delivery. Out of the 4 plates, 2 are chipped around the edges, 1 was completely destroyed, only 1 remains perfect."
4,A very good second work,"Ms Dynamite continues to please. This work is predominantly R&B, in comparison to her first release."
5,One of the very best recordings of Pierre Boulez's career.,"Any lingering stereotypes about the supposed ""coldness"" of Pierre Boulez's conducting should be put to rest by this stupendous recording. This may be the finest 'Concerto for Orchestra' ever recorded, with the great Chicago Symphony at their virtuosic best, and Boulez illuminating the tumultuous emotions of this piece like no other conductor. At times despairing, yearning, happy, humorous, gloomy, and ultimately triumphant, Boulez, with this recording, confirms his stature as one of the century's great conductors."
4,"Soft-Edged, Just a Bit Undercharacterized","Boulez is generally noted for his crystal clear textures and although that is present here to some extent, there is a soft sonic ambience that, for instance, takes away from the mystery and terror of Mmt III and the humor of Mmt II -- the Giuoco delle coppie -- is rounded off somehow. Everything is in place but somehow it doesn't have the rough good spirits that the classic Reiner/CSO recording has. I did like the First, Fourth and Fifth movements just fine, though. Although this is a good recording, it will not replace the Reiner even though that one has aged sonically."
2,Precise but bland,"This is a stunningly clear, perfect, precise reading of the concerto and Four Orchestral Pieces, wherein Boulez demonstrates he has stick technique that's perhaps the finest out there. The violin glissandi in the second movement of the Concerto are particularly exciting and vividly captured by DG. But while he sees not just the trees, but the leaves, the bark and the twigs, he misses the forest completely. These works lack the folksy-excitement of Bartok. It's Bartok under glass. It's a conductor who knows everything there is to know about music--except how to have fun with it. These are pieces of almost unbearable contrast--from mysterious to joyful to blistering to serene. They're not just a test of technique for the conductor but a test of conceptionization as well. Boulez's own earlier take on the music was much better, but for a real treat, hear Dorati and the LSO on Mercury Living Presence, and compare him to Boulez. Pierre, lighten up!"
1,Don't Buy This!,"I've never reviewed anything online before, but this thing was so bad, I felt I should warn others. First, the motor is incredibly loud! Also, it vibrates really hard and will shake the floor. The bubbles aren't very strong at all, they really don't do much. Also, you have to set it on something so air can circulate under it, or it won't make any bubbles at all. The one positive thing I can say is that my cat found it really intresting."
4,Pamper yourself!,"I received this unit as a gift. Overall, I am very happy with it.PROS:1.It has a handle which allows me to easily carry it back and forth from the bathroom to be filled and emptied. I always found I would have trouble carrying older units and would end up splashing water on the floor.2.I love the pedicure attachment! It is extremely handy and comes with many different removable heads. I also like that the heads have a storage place so I won't lose them.3.The ""seaweed"" on the bottom of the unit is very relaxing against my feet.CONS:1.I was a little confused by the whole heat function. The unit does not heat the water but is supposed to keep it warm. I found unless you put in really hot water to start then the water gets cold very quickly."
1,It Doesn't Work DON'T BUY IT!,"I bought my Homedic Foot Spa at Sears, the first of which I returned and the second of which I took to get my money back. Neither one of them worked properly (the bubbles part of it didn't work at all) and even if it had the motor is very loud. I think this would be a great product if it worked properly but it's just a piece of trash if it doesn't work."
2,Doesn't perform as advertised,"I just got this product and I am so disappointed. First, it says the unit does not heat the water so you have to put warm water in, but that it will maintain the heat. Well, it didn't. I put very warm water in and by the time I was done, just 10-15 minutes later, the water was luke warm. Second, I filled the water, as directed, to the fill line and still once the unit was on and my feet went in, the water was splashing all over the place. There were no bubbles near the toes. It did not seem as soothing as I thought it would be. I am considering sending it back and getting a refund or something different."
1,DUD!!!!,"Like the others have said, the bubbles are minimal and I've found don't come on at all sometimes and there is no way to turn them on. They just kick in when they feel like it apparently. The water gets very cold fast, I'd be better off just filling an empty kitty litter pan with hot water and sticking my feel in that. I also find the ""easy drain feature"" drains the water out under the attachments and there is physically no way to drain the water without getting all the attachments wet. Makes a lot of noise too and I thought it was supposed to be quiet.Buy a different one, I am!"
1,ZERO STARS FOR THIS PRODUCT,"This product was not received in even WORKING ORDER. Who has time for such nonsense? (buying, returning, reordering). I contacted manufacturer, who refused to take responsibility for this nonfunctioning product, and advised I return to Macy's. Macy's wants $7 to return...I HAVE TO PAY THEM TO TAKE THIS DEFECTIVE MERCHANDISE BACK? I won't bother...Between Homedics and Macy's, they should have been able to get this right the first time, right? Wrong! Buy a Rubbermaid dishwashing tub and a pumice stone...a fraction of the cost and just as effective! Never again.....Let's see how many e-mails I get from the businesses involved wishing to correct this..Yeah, riiiiight!"
2,Not everything it says,I liked some of the features of this when I first got it. I would agree with everyone else that it does not maintain heat at all and if you rest your feet on the bottom the bubbles are reduced greatly. But it was still nice to have the pedicure feature and the sea grass did feel nice. Carry handle also made it easy to fill and empty in the bath tub. Now the really concerning part - I used it just tonight and went to turn it on and noticed the bubbles didn't work at all. I tried the pedicure attachment and that didn't work either. After about 5 minutes I tried again to see if they would work and picked up the pedicure attachment and it burned my hand - it was melted! I immediately took my feet out and unplugged it and realized the whole bottom had melted and there was water all over my carpet. I am not sure what caused this but I checked google to see if there was a recall on this and I couldn't find anything. Scary! Just be careful if you buy one of these!
1,Water Bucket,"Don't waste your money. You will get as much pleasure from hot water in a big Rubbermaid bucket as this Homedics device. I just received this as a Christmas present and it is going back. Years ago, I had a Dr. Scholl's footbath that vibrated, heated the water, and was an absolute joy. It broke. I don't understand why, 20 years later, the foot baths on the market are weak, messy, and can't heat the water let alone keep it warm.Cons: No power, no heat, and virtually no relaxation.Pros: Based on reviews I have read on other machines, it is light, easy to carry with a fold-down handle, and comes with a nifty foot pedicure device that can be attached to the base unit or hand-held. Unfortunately, I will not test it because IT IS GOING BACK!!! Oh yeah, another plus is that it doesn't splash over the side like other units, probably because IT LACKS THE POWER!!!"
1,Waste of money,"I chose this model because it was the only one available in the store (Bed, Bath and Beyond) for which I had a 20% off coupon. Well, is didn't heat water at all. The store promptly exchanged the unit. The second one didn't heat either and was much noisier than the first one. I plan to return it this coming weekend."
1,Could be so much better!,"Quick notes:- Water gets cold very quickly- bubble wand doesn't work all the time, especially when your feet are resting on the bottom- if you're expecting a salon quality finish on your feet, then don't buy this and just go to a professional- hand wand is very loud- if you're not careful, you can burn your skin and nails in a matter of seconds when using the various parts for the hand wand- this item is not worth the price tag on it and should be lowered"
3,Not great quality,"First use: noticed that the heat function that is supposed to maintain the temp of the water you put in is basically non-functional. Water cools off dramatically (thanks to aeration) in about 10 minutes.Second use: the pumice stone came unglued from its attachment base, rendering it useless.What's going to go wrong with 3rd and 4th use and beyond???Overall rating: C-. I still save a bundle over pedicures at the salon, but it ain't great. Not highly recommended - not at $60!"
1,I DON'T LIKE ANY KNOPF CITY GUIDE,"Don't confuse the Knopf city guide with the Knopf Guide. The Knopf Guides are quite good. The city guide, of which I have mistakenly bought several, is very short, and devotes at least 80% to where to eat, where to stay, where to shop, where to find night life...20% or less useful info of what to visit if your'e a tourist. And the maps are pretty useless too."
2,colorful pictures but not practical,"This is not a very practical guide book. The descriptions of hotels/places to see are very brief and the guide does not suggest good itinaries to tour Madrid. Pages on the right are random photo samplings of tourist spots/hotels which give the reader a good overview of the place. The description of hotels does not include specific prices only price ranges. First time visitors to Madrid are better off getting the ""Eyewitness Travel Guides""."
3,The Great Pyramid-LostLegend of Enoch,"This film had many interesting points, but it did not go into much more detail than I have already read about in other book."

5,Got Me Home!,I was riding on a bike trail when I went off course and ended up with tons of nasty goat-head throns stuck in my tires. After spending like 25 min pulling them out I had at least 6 holes in each tire and the slime plugged them all allowing me to make it home without a flat. I plan on replacing them with these same tubes because I know I can count on them.
1,not a fan of green slime,Not a fan of this tube at all. Low quality and not durable at all. The green stuff is very messy too. Lasted only 2 months in a 5 year olds bike who rides the short driveway and sometimes street when I take him riding. Very cheap feeling rubber
1,Forget it,I was tired of buying inner tubes for my son so I thought the extra $ would give me the better service. NOT with the product. They popped just the same as the other and were really messy. No recommendation here.
4,good product,"I hated slime products for years because this stuff prevents repair of holes, though it self-repairs for smaller thorn-pricks and stops slow leaks. Since, however, tubes are normally less than ten bucks, it is difficult to motivate myself to repair them, favoring instead simple replacement. Thus the slime self-sealing seems worth it now....."
5,Great Product,I use these on my bike trailer tires. All the random junk along the the road sides is hard to avoid hitting and getting flats. These tubes provide safety and added durability in what is a hostile environment for bike tires.
1,quality just is not there,"i bought two of these slime (ball) tubes just for use in a garden cart which sees only use to haul wood about 20 feet several times a year. low use. no nails, thorns etc in the way.one tube lasted a few months the other made it to 8 months. when they leak the LEAK, and it IS VERY messy. it is impossible to repair the hole due to the goo. the tube seems to deteriorate especially at the seams. and when there is a leak the hole is rather large, about 3/8 inch; and the area around the hole seems to be again with the deteriorated rubber.i had hoped paying more would have saved me troubles ... but the cheap walmart and kmart tubes have done far better.i would never ever buy any tube that had 'self sealant'...these are impossible to patch...they go, you toss."
1,Hilarious! But not intentionally.,"There are a few good concepts in this book, but they are so buried under Grey's ridiculous language, it's not worth bothering. His descriptions of things are florid, bizarre and cringeworthy-- one embarassing example: ""A man's persistent sexual longing is really his soul seeking wholeness. The barren landscape of living only in his mind seeks union with the rich, sensuous, colorful and sweet-smelling terrain of his heart."" (p. 29) Uh... WHAT? It did have my husband and I rolling with laughter for hours, but that's probably not what the author intended. When my husband wants to let me know he's feeling amorous, he says ""Honey, my soul is feeling sooooo barren."" Then we laugh hysterically. The suggestions of what to say to your partner about things are so stilted and strange, I can't imagine anyone saying them with a straight face. Men aren't from Mars, but if John Grey is, it would explain a lot."
2,Very dissapointed,"I wasn't expecting this book to somehow transform my sex life, but I certainly didn't expect the garbage I read.Yes, he makes some preaty good, but obvious observations. For example, ""...when a man looks [at another woman], he needs to look appropriately."" Or that a woman like to hear she's beautiful.This is definitely a man writing to an audince of women. There is some good advice here, but you have to be able to distinguish it from the nonsense."
1,Even worse than the original,"Gee. Just what we all need, a sex guide from a guy who has raked in to dough by repeating over and over that men and women are different. There is absoultely NOTHING in this book that will be news to anybody who has ever made an effort at openess and honesty. That anyone would need a book like this from such a monumental ego is downright scary."
1,gray is old hat,"I cannot believe what Gray thinks about women.It's insultingand sterotyical.How would he know,how would anyone know whatevery woman and every man is thinking or wanting anyway!Women are crockpots and men are blow torches he says.He nevergets to the truth of why this sometimes is so - it's calledsocialisation.Socialisation influences us so much,we don'tsometimes know it's happening because it's so planted in ourminds.Read Rudov,I just got done with his book and he has ideas whichwill end all of your relationship problems.Some might beshocked by his revolutionary and courageous ideas but sometimesone has to be shocked into a new way of thinking in order tochange for the better."
2,Not what I had hoped it would be.,"Although Gray makes some interesting points, it seems that he takes three pages to make one point. I found the pulled quotations in larger print to be distracting. If you only read those quotations, however, you would probably be able to skip most of the rest.I found his description of his life after being a monk to be offensive. He boasts about how much sex he had after nine years of celibacy, and he seems to have approached it as a research project, rather than a means of expressing love. I find it hard to take advice from someone who obviously is not ""into"" a monogamous relationship, as my husband and I are."
2,There are better books,Book is ok and has some good points but it is def written from a mans point of view. Lots of advice about giving him quickies when you don't want to have sex. I'm not sure that helps me at all. Seems more like I would be resentful?? Anyway try the books by Dr. Laura Berman instead. She seems to have a better idea as to the why's and how's of things. Good luck.
5,Highly recommended!,"If you think that passion cannot last in a long-term, monogamous relationship, then you really need to read this book. Dr. Gray gets specific."
2,Not up to the other Mars/Venus material,"I'm a big fan of the Mars/Venus materials. They have made a big difference in my relationships and improved my life as a result.This book, however, is not up to the same level as the others. It adds very little insight, and only a few helpful facts. Rather than get this book, I would recommend another reading of the original Mars/Venus book."
1,Doesn't Work,"I saw this book on the Penn and Teller show and I saw some excerpts about it. The one that got me more curious was the 20 phrases that can turn a woman on so I greet my lady friend with ""Your breasts are perfect"" and all I got was a what the hell response. I told her that it was supposed to turn her on but she said she thought I was being creepy so I did not get the desired result not to mention I really did feel like she had perfect breasts so I conveyed that. So I was lucky she just thought it was creepy instead of giving me an e-slap and calling me a pig. So this book is pretty inaccurate and I do not think feeling love or anything like that can be explained in a book anyhow. So for those who need to rely on book to help their love life go ahead but I will not rely on a faulty product to as how the kids would say ""get some""."
2,Are People Really This Lost?,"I've read Men's Health and for years been in a very sexually satisfying relationship. I checked this out of the local library curious to find some new information. While this book isn't terrible it is terribly basic. I didn't get the sense that men are portrayed as ""conquerors"" as other reviewers; it just seems that men are portrayed as clueless.Personally I didn't find anything I didn't already know, just in this volume it's dressed up a little bit presumably so Dr. Gray can sneak the word ""dick"" in to show us he's ""getting real."""
2,Well intentioned advice for men; women not included.,"Dr. Gray must be a wonderful lover. As a woman I read his hints and suggestions for a man's love making technique and marvel at his insight. I truly could not have imagined a man so aware of what a woman really wants in the bedroom. However there are no corresponding ideas for a woman geared to improviing her skills as a lover. By maintaining a position of gallant ""ladies first"" mentality he, in truth, is demeaning the power of women's sexuality.There is much to be gained by men reading this book. Attitudes can improve, skill levels can rise and even the articulation of loving feelings can be created and/or grow with the help of this book's suggestions. Women are unfortunately reduced to being receipients of, not participants in, in bedroom activity."
3,"BANE ,Alittle `SAW' & a tad `H P LOVECRAFT' this is a movie with some stuff to Frighten !","So these ladies may have been kidnapped,That's pretty bad news.Some medical types are experimenting with/on them...Not good.Is that aCthulhu alien ???So,These factors are unsettling and then they get a `Time To Die' carved into their bodies.There is alot going on and the title BANE was never explained to our satisfaction,Were the producers playing off the release of new BATMAN film with the villian, BANE or is it the explaination of the word -a person or thing that ruins or spoils."
5,Awesome camera,I have to admit I was a little scared pushing the purchase button due to the low price for all of the items offered. I am very please that I paid what most people pay for just a body of a camera and yet I got all those items. I have really enjoyed my camera. It has features that I still have not learned to use yet. The picture clarity is unbelievable. This is the best deal on an SLR yet. Thanks Amazon!
5,You Rock!!!,"I agree with you all the way. You couldn't have said it better. TALK ABOUT TH DOLL!!! Madison has a beautiful dress and sparklin' extra outfit! She is even more beautiful in real life. I saw all of them on ebay, and they are BEAUTIFUL. I'm talkin' 100% GOR-GE-OUZZZ!!!!! I'm going to purchase Barbie and Chelsea, while my sister will get the other 2.

5,She IS Beautiful!,"I am so getting this doll, and I can't wait till she is released. Cuz' she is drop dead gor-ge-ouz! Don't listen to the 1 STAR reviews if they talk about bratz! MADISON ROCKS!"
1,To Parents: YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED,"As a teen(17) myself I must say even I am dissapointed. Madison is the most clothed doll in this collection and she still looks like a worker of ""the worlds oldest profession"". This doll dosn't promote the right message to most children who want it, they don't understand that we(teens/young adults) only dress like this at party's not every day and that not everyone should have random body peircings. These dolls look like plastic Paris Hiltons(don't want your baby to be like her do you?). I wouldn't buy this doll for my niece, but if you do but this doll for the child in your life PLEASE explain to them the rights and wrongs of this doll.P.SSTOP SAYING BLING BLING.WHEN RAPPERS MOVE ON TO A NEW WORD SO SHOULD YOU. THATS THE WAY SLANG WORKS THE WORD IS LIKE 6+YRS. OLD."

4,Okay,"I Like this Bling Bling doll although her second outfit (just my opinion and pardon my language) Sucks. But the doll is very pretty, the only one in the bling bilng line that is wearing enough clothing. Her dress is very neat, i like the design and glitter is always good. But her boots make the outfit.* *Ally* *Age 13(Danial Capps is my dad, not me)"

Ok, you don't like My Scene, then don't cuss and write ugly things about them. I'm from Detroit and I will beat you up Zoe the ziggacola. [...]"
5,Book is available,"For those who'd like a copy of this book for its contents not its collector's value, it is available in PDF format on a Google search of the title. Both Vols. 1 & 2 can be found by looking through the Google list.Here's a question for those interested in ancient history: What is the first certain date of history that can be aligned with our calendar, and how do we know that date is certain?"
5,Used College Texts,"The text came in great condition, I am very satisfied with the text. I will buy more texts from Amazon as I need them."
1,Sydney Dream DVD,"Beautiful photography, men, and setting, but........very disappointing sexually. Apparently Australia, or the USA in imported Aussie films will not allow any views of oral/genital sex.You see great frontal nudity, kissing and ""cuddling"" with heads bobbing up and down and groans -- but NEVER any shots of oral/genital contact or orgasm shots (just groans).Most disappointing -- beautiful men, but very unfulfilling for the viewer. Always a stragically placed arm or leg blocking any direct shots."
3,cougar canyon,Cougar canyon is a nice movie I liked all the Arizona desert scenesas I have been over most of the places in the movie
1,Nature Worship,This movie had more in it about how Indians worship nature and creation than about the life of a cougar. Not worth the money.
1,Legend of Cougar Canyon,"This movie is a good example of baiting animals for the purpose of a ""good photo shot"". Within the first 7 minutes you will witness an eagle snared to a bush supposedly having attacked a rabbit. A cougar is meanwhile stalking the eagle. As the cougar pounces the eagle struggles to fly away but is either tied to or won't let go of the obviously snared rabbit. The eagle is then killed by the cougar. Was an eagle (supposedly a young bald eagle?) sacrificed for this supposed family film?Obviously, wildlife filming has seen many advances since 1976. I would only recommend this film as a lesson in now outlawed animal cruelty."
1,Depressing and farfetched,"A book where most of the victims are children and pedophilia is the norm. Giant jellyfish roam the seas. It was all I had to read on a long plane flight, so I managed to finish it just to see if the end made sense. No, not really."
5,Medusa,"Wow. Talk about action. Every scene crackles with energy, and impending or actual disaster, so much so that the novel threatens to implode under its own ambition, but it never does. Give Moody credit. A lesser writer wouldn't have been able to handle a tenth of the plot elements in the book. But as it stands, Medusa is three hundred-twenty-five of the fastest pages you might ever read.Medusa is filled with excitement, pathos, and humor. More thriller than whodunnit, it's the best book yet in the series, though it's probably not the best place to start. I think the book (and the deaths of some characters) might lose some impact if you're not already familiar with the characters.Thank you, Ms. Moody, for another fine effort."
4,this author is amazing!,"Iron Rose is one of the most interesting fact-based but fictionalized novels I have ever read. I was so interested to learn that the main character is based on the author's grandmother's real life experiences, and that Lorie went all the way to Austria to hear and tape record Rose's experiences in her own voice. But few authors could take the amazing events of this woman's life (which are truly stranger than fiction) and weave them into a book so intriguing. It is not only a eye-witness account of one woman's real experiences during World War II, but also a deeply sensitive look at human nature. Lorie Davis is, in my opinion, a first-rate writer!"
2,Too expensive and ineffective,"English-Korean is all right, but the Korean-English section is terribly confusing. Since the dictionary uses hangul, why are the Korean words alphabetized according to the romanizations? For a beginning Korean student, learning the hangul alphabetical order is challenge enough. Add a seemingly erratic romanization (there is no one standard system of writing Korean words in Roman letters), and you have a very confused student! For this much money, find a dictionary that is strictly hangul without confusing romanizations."
2,Romanizing Korean is a bad habit,"I second Minerva Rheault's motion: Romanizing Korean is not a good idea. However, my objection is somewhat different--any serious student of the Korean language will eventually look up items which are not in this dictionary. The sooner that student learns the Korean alphabet, the better.Would you serve a drink to an alcoholic?If not, then don't serve Romanization to a student of the Korean language."
2,Obsolete Words,"This dicitonary is OK. When my Korean teacher (I am an expat living in Seoul, so I trust that she knows Korean backwards & forwards)checks my homework, often she says, ""no one uses that word any more."" It is also common to not find words that I need in this dictionary."
4,I would recommend this.,"This is a good beginners dictionary. Its not too big that I can carry it with me while out and about, but not too small either (it won't fit in your pocket/normal size purse). The only down side is that the korean part is filed under romanization instead of hangul. It does have the hangul printed next to it, but I have found that the romanization can throw people off the correct pronunciation.The book was in very good condition, looked brand new like it never been opened. Got here in a reasonable time too (ordered it around Christmas)."
1,Audio skips!,I dont know how amazon ripped this CD but it skips everywhere in the same places no matter what mp3 player I use. Otherwise its sublime. Just annoying when you're trying to listen to it and it keeps skipping. I want my money back!
3,Informative...,"I bought this book hoping to gain some insight into law enforcement careers that I might be interested in. It did have some information that was good, although the book does have a decidedly ""Federal"" spin; more than half the book is dedicated to Federal agencies, but this is to be expected since Mr. Douglas is a former FBI agent. The book does contain very general information, although I was hoping for more tips and advice that a person could use in order to pursue a law enforcement career, other than wavetop overviews of several different agencies, most of which a reader could gain through visiting the websites for those agencies."
4,worth the money,"Although much of the information in this book is available on the internet, you can't find it unless you know what your looking for. This book covers a very broad range of federal, State and local law enforcement organizations, from the well known to obscure. Each having a small 2-10 page section on the agencies history, positions and duties, and requirements for employment. Some examples of organizations covered are the FBI, DEA, ATF, Bostan PD, and also smaller ones like Department of State Security, ICE, and Park Rangers. Yes they have special agents too. Of course if you know which agencies interest you then definitly find a more specialized book. But if your like me and want a more general preview then this is a well spent 15$."
3,Find out the same information online for free,"This book is very general in nature. Most of the book is fluffed up with detailed descriptions and history of city departments that you will never apply too. As far as his more extensive knowledge on federal agencies like the ATF, DEA, FBI, CIA, this book's information is dated in salary scale and half of the requirements listed to obtain the position.He fluffs up the book even more by using the first chapter to scare away those people that should not become officers. All and all, I learned a little bit from this book, but if I took a brief few minutes online, I could have easily found more in depth information for free, without the dated material, from a man the has RECENTLY been a law enforcement officer."
4,"Great game of chess, but....","....the writing , lacks something.As the story unfolded, and people started to die, I just didn't feel like any of the characters were really bothered by it, regardless of their strong realtionships to the murdered.And the main character's habbit of drinking strong bitter coffe, smoking unfiltered cigarettes, and occasionly consuming alcohol,(and that's pretty much all she does,since she is supposed to be a strong female after all),is such a cliche.Yet after all, all the intrigue justified most of such banalities,and it proved to be a page turner and a brain tickler, but someone recommended the author to me for being similar to Umberto Eco. Well, he was wrong..."
3,Good Start - Poor Finish,"This murder mystery starts off very promisingly with the superb ingredients of the shady Art world , the esoteric world of Chess ,greed and a set of well demarked characters. However despite some clever tricks , the plot gets rather cumbersome, the Chess theme is a bit overplayed and the motives of the killer eventually though well delineated are less than believable."
2,"Not nearly as good as ""The Club Dumas""","I very much enjoyed The Club Dumas for its clever use of plot, subplot and the weaving in of Alexander Dumas' writing style. Thinking I'd found a clever writer, I unfortunately choose to read The Flanders Panel. I was very disappointed by this book. On the plus side, I enjoyed the mystery embedded in the painting and the use of chess imagery was intriguing. On the down side, the villian's identity was telegraphed way too early in the book which took the mystery out of the main plot. Finding out why this person did the evil deeds was a big let down and quite unsatisfying. I didn't believe the motive for a minute. Will I read other books by Arturo Perez-Reverte? Based on the strength of The Club Dumas I would say yes, but if the next one turns out as weak as The Flanders Panel I will relegate this author to my never again list."
2,"Yep, the chess game was a let-down","The obvious flaw in the analysis of the crucial chess game, also pointed out by another reviewer, totally blew this book away for me. Nice cover, nice typing, but intellectual? Not even clever. Looking for anther Eco? Don't bother. What a disappointment..."
3,"Entertaining novel, but cliched characters","This is an enjoyable murder mystery. I don't think the author is an expert on art or chess as his descriptions of both seem simplistic. Munoz would have solved the initial problem in twenty minutes - not two days. If Julia was really an art expert she would have noticed certain things in the painting much earlier. The gay caricature (Cesar) will probably offend many readers - I think the author has watched too many Noel Coward films! Munoz is a non-player's stereotypyical view of a one dimensional chess maestro. The ending is reminiscent of an episose of Scooby Doo - the amateur sleuths unmasking the improbable villain who proceeds to confess all. Despite these faults the author succeeds in sustaining a tense, fascinating story for most of its 295 pages."
4,"Great mystery, until the ending","This is the second book that I have read from ARTURO PEREZ-REVERTE, and just like the first I was turning pages as quickly as I could read them (The Club Dumas). It's a great story which has the heroine figuring out a mystery from the past. I thought the character development was excellent and it really showed that there are good people and there are bad (even the people you don't suspect, have their own human flaws)in this world (even if they are fictional). I was particularly empressed with the twists and turns all the way up to the ending; which then kind of fizzeled my interest(reason for 4 stars - last chapter). Perhaps I didn't get it but I was completely let down when the final checkmate was discovered and the perptrator was revealed. Overall this book was worth the read and peaked my interest in art as well as in chess. A novice who is interested in the craft of chess should give this book a read."
4,a different twist,I liked the plot. The characters were interesting . The flow of sory was good. You will like this especially if you play Chess.
4,Horrible conversion to kindle,"The kindle version of the book is horrible. Whoever converted it to kindle format must have used a 1980s text conversion program. The missing words, random capitalization of words in the middle of sentences, misspellings, random text justifications, etc. are so frequent (at least one every other page) it effects the flow of the story. It reads like a cheap self-published ebook. It is definitely not worth 8.99. Even at $.99 it would be annoying. I have the paperback copy and became frustrated after downloading and reading about half way through. Then gave up. Amazon should give refunds via publisher when the formatting is this bad!"
1,"Thin plot, shallow research","A centuries-old murder mystery in which the only clues are offered by an enigmatic chess game in a Dutch painting -- a promising premise, but the execution is sadly lacking.The course of the mystery is unsatisfying and inconsistent, so that it does not pay to read this book for the suspense. In addition, the characters are entirely flat and predictable, except when some supreme act of irrationality is required in order to move the plot along, so you also need not buy this book for the sake of the drama. Finally, while I cannot comment on the author's grasp of art history, anyone who has ever read a chess book can tell that Mr. Perez-Reverte has not, and therefore I cannot recommend this book as a source of edification.However, I must admit that this novel serves quite admirably as a doorstop."
1,A French best seller? But so are Jerry Lewis & Mickey Rouke,"The reviewers that compared this to Name Of The Rose either didn't read Eco's book or were educated at an exceptional trade school.My kid's Barbie has more depth than any of these stereotypical characters. The mystery is slightly more challanging than a word search puzzle, and the denouemont is silly enough to make you cry that trees were cut down to make this book.The chess problem was the only good thing about this waste of time except I don't read fiction to learn chess."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"I read this book because it was compared to Umberto Eco's Name of the Rose. Turns out, however, Mr. Perez-Reverte isn't fit to carry Eco's breastplate (emblazoned with the Rosy Cross, of course). The characters are one-dimensional, the plot thin and the resolution so contrived and implausible it felt like I was reading the script for a TV movie. I wasn't surprised to read that the author is a tele-journalist. It shows. Anyone who compares this book with The Name of the Rose ought to be flogged the by the remaining members of the Knights Templar."
2,Neat premise - the chess puzzle's solution is incorrect,Great concept - poor followthrough. But most importantly: the author got the chess problem (which the book centers around) WRONG! The board position shown could only be legally reached if the bishop's pawn (on A5) had taken the knight. It is a simple matter of transportation and pawn movement. The retrograde analysis given in the book is flawed. Kinda disappointing...
4,"A intelligent, gripping mystery.","The characters are overdrawn. The plot contains several contrived twists. But the set-up is fascinating, and the resolution takes many unexpected turns throughout the book. Chess enthusiasts will enjoy some of the intracicies of the game interspersed through the book, and the chess-player character is the most sincere. If you can get past the other cartoon characters in the book,this mystery is for you"
3,Check! - In an Allegorical Kinda Way,"Just how many different chess games were going on here, anyway? And how many of them used a conventional chessboard and pieces? I found the chess game in the picture Julia was restoring the most compelling. I liked that the author tried to stretch the boundaries of dimension. But the ending! Was it believable? Did I buy that it would be THAT person for THOSE reasons? And the start of that beautiful friendship as the two walked away into the twilight? Truly stretching it"
5,A game of chess becomes terrifyingly real!,"Take: one art restorer; a painting depicting a game ofchess; four mysterious words: ""Who killed the knight?""; onereal-life chess expert; an enigmatic father figure; and anounce of curiosity; and you have the magnificent recipe foran engrossing novel that is part mystery, part thriller, yetso much more.This is a beautifully written book that you will want to ownand reread."
2,Naive light-weight,"This book has an interesting theme at heart, however theexecution is lacking in any real unique features. Much of the'philosophical' or 'meta-physical' depths of the charactersare simply naive renditions of themes discussed in Hofstadter.The translation perhaps was an obstacle to ennjoying the paceof the story with a very varied style and no real attention todetail or consistancy.The book does have the desired quality of a real page turner, though this reader was glad to turn the last page. Beter off with 'Godel, Escher, Bach'!"
3,"Not the best, but still a good read","After having read the ""Club Dumas"" without having been able to put it down, I compulsively reached for the Flanders Panel.It is also a very well written, enjoyable book to read. Perez-Reverte's style is not presumptuous, and at the same time, filled with rich details woven into a great plot line and real characters.However, the detailed representations of the chess game may make it a difficult read for some. If you don't enjoy the game analysis (for the author actually employs diagrams and move lists), I suggest you skip those sections. The story will still make sense, although a lot of the symbolism will be lost. If you enjoy the game, by all means, read this book. I had not played in a long time, but the book made me dust off my chess set. Perez-Reverte succeeds in bringing the game, and a murder plot symbolized in the chess pieces, to life like the ""Flanders Panel"" brought the depicted scene to life with its realism."
3,Very readable,"This is the first book I've read by Perez-Reverte. I found it very readable and enjoyed it. It started of a little slow but picked up nicely.The character development of the three main characters was handled very well. The main character, Julia, an art restorer in Spain, is restoring a fictional painting depicting a chess game played in the 1500's. While doing so, she discovers a hidden message - Quis Necavit Equitem - Who killed the Knight? Julia is determined to solve a 500 year old mystery of who killed one of the players depicted in the painting.Her two allies in the search, the wise Cesar and the quirky Munoz , are polar opposites that Perez-Reverte weaves together to form a very good murder mystery. I especially like the character Munoz."
3,Fascinating Notion...utterly lacks emotion!,"I've been eager to read more Perez-Reverte since The Club Dumas, and The Flanders Panel seemed right up my alley for ""intellectual"" intrigue.I must say that the first half of the book is remarkable and, though the execution of everything falls a bit short, I do think the entire sweep of the story is commendable. However, my criticism lies in Julia's character who, after the mysteroius murders of two of her friends, she goes about attempting to piece together the mystery without a single hint of emotion toward the loss of her loved ones. Nothing at all. It's all back to business for her. Who acts like this???Even in the end, (which I won't spoil), she turns her back on a 20+ year companion who's about to hurt himself in a very serious way. True, given the elements of the story, their 20 year relationship is in question, but I just felt that it was heartless of her to do.Thumbs way way up for the premise.Thumbs kinda teetering downwards on the characters."
3,Brush Up Your Chess Skills,"""The Flanders Panel"" by Arturo Perez-Reverte (""The Club Dumas"") is not your routine whodunnit. The title refers to a 15th-century painting of a game of chess, which not only holds the key to a 500-year-old murder mystery, but stirs up deadly consequences in the present. I found it intriguing, but lost track of the chess game which forms an integral part of the plot, and found myself wishing the author had included background notes on Flemish art and Renaissance history."
2,A (bad) TV movie?,"Interesting premise, but poor execution. Stereotypical characters, meandering psycho-babble, unsatisfying conclusion. Dissappointing read."
3,riggsmama,"I read part of this book for a book club. I made it half-way through it and just didn't want to read any more. I found the author too descriptive and he said in two paragraphs what could be said in one sentence. The story is intriguing, however, and the characters are likable."
3,Fabulous first 2/3!,"I loved the set up and characters of this book, and really enjoyed up until the first mystery was solved (the murder revealed in the painting) but the rest felt a little stretched to me..."
3,"Interesting premise, but...","A friend of mine had read this in Spanish along with Perez-Reverte's other novels and really enjoyed them. I found the language awkward, the characters one-dimensional stereotypes and the plot way too outlandish to suspend my disbelief. I wasn't sure why the characters felt so emotionally involved in the ancient ""mystery"", and as the present day plot unfolded, there were just too many times I felt a rational person who was not a character in a mystery novel would have behaved differently than the characters in the book did. I enjoyed the Madrid setting, the chess game, and did feel compelled to finish the book; it's as if there were something really good in there, but I just couldn't unearth it. I was left wondering if something were lost in translation."
2,Sophmoric Chess Mystery,"For the most part ""The Flanders Panel"" was a disappointment. It was undoubtedly well-researched, but the plot didn't grab me. I never felt that tug pulling me to the book and forcing me to continue reading. I could put it down at any moment. I like this author, but I found this book cliched and shallow. The characters lacked depth, and there was a repetitive quality to the prose, so that I found myself correctly anticipating how a sentence would end. I had difficulty connecting with his world of fine art and antiques. Maybe that's just my problem as far as choice of reading material, but I think Perez-Reverte is a more inventive writer than that. And then the central mystery, ""Ooooh, I'm scared, somebody left chess moves on my car! Gasp!"" Just not very thrilling. But I would recommend ""Queen of the South"" to anyone."
4,The Flanders Panel,Intense and intriging suspense novel. Keeps you thinking. The author has a unigue ability to bring the characters alive.
4,Captivating Mystery Let Down by Ending,"The Flanders Panel by Arturo Perez-Reverte (translated well by Margaret Jull Costa) is a wonderfully written and engrossing mystery that is let down by a very pedestrian ending. The delightful combination of art, history, chess and suspense is blended masterfully together in a clever and potent mix that, ultimately, is too rich to be sustained. The reader will be carried along, particulary anxious to find out how all these elements can come together as it seems beyond belief that there is a coherent purpose behind all of this delightful madness. The reader would be right as the all the silly psychobabble at the end simply leaves a bitter aftertaste after the sumptuous meal provide for in setting up the situation."
3,"An uninspired effort from the Author of ""Club Dumas""","I read ""Club Dumas"" after randomly picking it up from a shelf in a bookstore, and have been reading other Arturo Perez-Reverte's books hoping for a repeat. This definitely was not it. In general, this is not a bad effort, but when the mystery of the painting is revealed well before the end, the story gets less and less interesting. I was very disappointed with the ending and characters were not at all inspiring or particularly engaging, with the exception of the Chess Player, perhaps. There also seemed to be some confusion in author's head between Flemish and Dutch painting styles of the period as well as other art history inaccuracies. Those certainly detracted from the credibility of characters in the book as well as the author's. I found this to be an O.K. way to spend a few hours, but not in the same league as either Mr. Perez' own ""Club Dumas"" nor ""Headlong"" by Michael Frayn."
3,"Brilliant idea, great start, but peters out with weak ending","I read this book in French while touring France in September 1993 and greatly enjoyed both the chess angle (being a poor but longtime player) and the historical and artistic angles. Makes you look a bit closer at those paintings in the Louvre between chapters. However, as many other readers found, the characters were simply boring except Munoz the chessplayer. The psychology of chess bit was very interesting for all chess lovers as were the philosophical tidbits. The ending is poor as if the author couldn't figure out a decent ending. So I give it a 3 stars out of five for a decent ride, but in no way can this book be compared to the Name of the Rose as a mystery-thriller."
4,great book but you can guess the ending,"This is an enjoyable read, with two very interesting central characters. Chapters are contained enough for this to be a good bedtime read. Unfortunately, at about 150 pages, you can guess who did it. Still, getting there is fun. Reminds me of some of the Susan Isaacs books."
3,"Good beach reading, but does not compare to Eco.","An interesting premise, and a delightful way to spend a weekend at the beach. The translation is sometimes stilted and unidiomatic. Any comparisons with Eco's The Name of the Rose are overly ambitious."
3,Looking closer at the chess puzzle ...,"Other reviewers of The Flanders Panel have given an excellent summary of the sometimes frustrating nature of this intersting work, which can be summarised as ""very clever ideas, only partially realized"". For a novel that blends chess and mystery so strongly it is disappointing to find that the central chess premise is in fact wrong. From the unusual pawn position it is possible to determine that the white knight was taken by the black pawn on a5."
4,A Valiant Effort,"I enjoyed reading this book very much. Not being a chess expert I may have enjoyed it more than some reviewers that complained that the chess puzzle was not clever. I suppose it is true that not being an expert of chess helped me be interested in the book, yet, in spite of that, if you are a chess expert, lighten up and enjoy anyway. Mr Perez Reverte is a journalist and a writer, not Jose Raul Capablanca. the plot was nicely laid and the writing very good, and the only reason I did not rate this a full 5 stars was because some of the characters, Julia and Munoz, kind of diasppointed me, but I also suspect that the author never meant to give us perfect human beings. And also, I felt I got the answer of who killed (took) the knight too soon. I certainly recommend this book to anyone wanting a mystery with style. Finally, I simply am amazed that one reviewer called this book homophobic. How can someone so misread a book?"
4,Good At First Then Becomes Cloying,"Perhaps due to the translation? I own this book and have read and re-read it numerous times, finding something new and interesting in the chess mystery each time. But I also have increasingly grown to dislike the main character Julia, who is insipid, self-righteous and somewhat two-faced in her dealings with the characters Menchu and Montegrifo. Again, it's perhaps due to a less than superior translation, but still, the irritating characteristics of Julia, combined with the slightly self-conscious descriptive tactics of the author himself, combined to annoy me the last time I read the book. The characters of Menchu and Cesar I found the most interesting and (strangely) sympathetic, far more than Julia's self-righteous finger pointing and philosophic offshoots about identity and art. A great idea and most of it was executed very well, but I found myself dearly wanting to smack the main character at the book's end."
3,The Flanders Panel,"A wonderful quirky book. At times it's a bit melodramatic, perhaps from the translation, or the Spanish culture. The answers to the mystery, come out of nowhere: what appears to be clues are just part of the book, and are not intended as red-herrings, this is true of The Games of Chess, ""The Flanders Panel"" itself."
3,Good - until the end.,"The Flanders Panel by Arturo Perez-Reverte is a wonderfully written mystery novel that grabs you from the beginning. An old painting, called the ""Flanders Panel"" is being readied for auction with some restoration work. During the course of that work a hidden message is found and the mystery begins. The painting features two people playing chess, and an analysis of this game can solve a mystery from 500 years in the past. But a new mystery is created when people who have researched the painting begin dying. The novel holds you in great suspense until the poorly executed ending. Not only is the ending poorly executed, it is hardly beleivable, and quite frankly ruins this novel."
3,"Entertaining, but not great.","This was the first Perez-Reverte book I bought. The premise of the book sounded interesting to me, and it was, for a time. The discussion of the painting and the chess was interesting, and did make the book a page turner. However, after a time it was easy for me to see where the story was going to end up and that is why I do not rate this book higher. I found it enjoyable enough to read other Perez-Reverte books, but this is my least favorite."
4,Fascinating,"Having read one of the other reviews here I was surprised by the advice ""skip the chess move bits"". To me, although I am by no stretch of the imagination a keen chess player, these sections were the key to the story. Give yourself some time to go through the moves and you'll see how clever Reverte really is. In fact I found myself wishing that the spoken exposition that Reverte resorts to would end and he would go back to the more subtle metaphor of the chess game. An absolutely fascinating read.Although not as good as the Dumas Club or the Fencing Master."
2,Fairly interesting book with homophobic ending,"I found this book to be engrossing, but the ending was homophobic enough to make me squeamish...suggesting it was sinister and diabolical (even going so far as using chess moves to describe it). That's at least one I haven't heard before.Also, I don't know enough about chess to be bothered the mistake a few other reviews mention. I didn't even notice it, so I doubt your average chess player will be distracted by it."
3,Interesting reading,"This book starts very well; the saga is interesting as well as the characters. However, the story starts to lose the point by the end of the book. This is something that dissapointed me. However, I'm interested in reading other Perez's books."
3,"Great read, but ...","I tend to agree with most of the previous customers' reviews (although I did not read them until after I finished the book). The book started out great, the premise certainly original. It was a page turner until about the last quarter when I could almost predict what was going to happen next. Nevertheless, I did enjoy the book, especially the occasional ""sidelines"" or cultural/artistic digressions ... sort of Art History 101 in 6 easy lessons! But I love art and I love mystery novels and a combination of the two can not but give me pleasure! (All ye who are of the same ilk - check out Douglas Skegg's 'The Triumph of Bacchus', 'The Talinnin Madonna' or 'The Estuary Pilgrim' but not so much 'The Phoenix of Prague'). I am now reading Perez-Reverte's 'Club Dumas' and being thoroughly entertained! Somewhere on my constantly 'evolving' to-read list is his 'The Seville Communion'."
2,Intriguing start. Flat finish.,"The book started out with an interesting premise: After 500 years, a hidden inscription on a famous painting is revealed right before the painting is to be sold at auction. And murders occur which seem to be connected with the mysterious story of the painting. And the best way to uncover the mysteries of the hidden message and the murders is by decyphering a chess match depicted on the painting. Oh, how exciting. Well, it is interesting for a while and the chess puzzle is cute, but in the end... The ending was a disappointment. And the story about the painting just got to be too much. It had potential."
2,Good Until the End,"It was an interesting milieu for a mystery novel. There was a fascinating beginning. Unfortunately, the steam ran out by the end. Real let down...but good until then."
2,Not as good as it seems,"Well, the first time I hear from the book I thought it was gonna be great. I had the book at home, so I began to read it (not very fast but...). It was great at the beginning (murders, a great scheme...), but the thing I hated the most was the final part (if you have read the book you can go on reading on but if not....), when the girl, the one you think at the beginning she's perfect steals the money and scape with his friend... So, I think the book has a good scheme but an stupid end."
2,The chess problem was the only good thing about this book,"Even though some reviews have complained, the analysis of the chess problem was fairly convincing. If you assume that it is obvious whose turn it is because of the attitudes of the players in the painting, it is possible to deduce backwards two moves, and it was a very clever idea."
3,"amusing, not profound","This is an entertaining book, based on an unusual premise: a chess problem depicted in a 15th-century painting is the clue to solving a 15th-century murder and also is the impetus for a series of 20th-century murders that follow the same denouement as the the chess game! The chess problem is well-done, although some important questions are, frustratingly, unanswered (have any pawns promoted?) or are difficult to find the answers to (whose turn is it?). The plot is sufficiently interesting, but the characters aren't - Julia is a remarkably uninspiring heroine. I actually preferred her trampy friend (I think, though the author might disagree, she intended to make those cultural malapropisms). Despite the weak characters, this is an enjoyable book; just don't expect something the as intellectual as ""The Name of the Rose."""
1,TOTAL FIASCO,"In lieu of Anne Rice's previous literary accomplishments, I was filled with anticipation when ""Servant of the Bones"" was released. Unfortunately, my excitement swiftly turned into bitter disappointment. How can someone who writes mesmerizing novels such as ""Interview with the Vampire"" and ""Cry to Heaven"" write such a confusing and pathetically boring novel? I had to exert much self-control in order to finish reading the book. Its bizarre plot and utterly shallow characters transform the entire storyline into a mind-numbing fiasco"
2,"BEAUTIFUL, BUT DISAPPOINTING.","ANNE RICE ALWAYS TRIES HARD TO MAKE US FEELFOR HER CHARACTERS, BUT SOMETIMES SHE FAILS.IT IS A SHAME FOR SUCH A WELL CRAFTED BOOK TOGO TO WASTE BECAUSE SHE TRIES TO MAKE US FEELFOR SOMEONE THAT HAS NO FEELINGS. IF YOU MUSTREAD ALL OF HER BOOKS THEN PICK THIS ONE UP.IF NOT, DON'T"
4,Great new character,"I was quite captivated by Azriel. I'm hoping Anne will use him in a whole new series. Although the 'Belkin' plot was a bit fantastic, I stayed the course to see what would happen to Azriel.I am a die-hard Anne Rice fan, have read all her books - including her ""Sleeping Beauty"" trilogy - and of all hercharacters, I would rate Azriel right up there with Lestat."
4,I hope this is a beginning to a new series...,"I read it in two days. I love Ann Rice's style. The way she mixes ancient history, magic, religion and mythlogy, leads one to wonder if such beings and rules exist. I am in love with the main character ""Azriel"", who is the ""Servant of the Bones"", and hope to follow him in future adventures. I think I even like him better than ""Lestat"" of the Vampire Chronicals (could be because I've read all those already and hunger for more of her books). I recommend this to all Anne Rice fans and more."
1,Servant of the Drones,"This book was recommended by a friend who has an inexplicable penchant for very dull, dry books with no discernible plot. This one fit right in."
2,Not one of Rice's best books.,I did not find this novel nearly as interesting as many of her others. I would recommend any of the Mayfair books or Vampire Chronicles over this.
2,"Tedious, boring","This is probably my 2nd least favorite Anne Rice novel. I remember it being uninteresting, the characters, bland, tiresome. I have read every single Anne Rice novel and dislike giving her any negative reviews, but unfortunetely, I found nothing to like about this particular book. Would I recommend it to a fan who has not read it? Truly, no. Though her quality of writing is superb as ever, the book offers no reward upon finishing it."
1,"Good start, then surprisingly tedious","For someone who is capable of writing The Vampire Lestat, this book is a shame. It starts out wonderfully, with Rice's vivid visions of ancient times, but then fizzles out into ... utter boredom. Who can empathize with a character who deems a thief worthy of murdering? Who can stick with the lifeless plot of the second half of the book? Those who liked the book, I suppose. Seems like this book was written for the author, not the reader."
1,Azriel's tale is nothing but tedious dialogue!,"I started this book a couple of days ago because I thought Rice would put me in the mood for Halloween--was I WRONG!! The cover promised a tale that took you through several interesting historical eras--instead it BORES you through those eras. Only a brief section of the book took you into the time of the Black Death, I don't know why they even mentioned it on the cover.Azriel has tediously similar dialogues over and over which finally caused me to start skimming the book in the hopes I would get to something interesting!! It NEVER happened I remained uninterested until the bitter end.Unlike the reviewer who took two years to read it, I read it with the speed of light because there was nothing to savor! This book was garbage and that is where I threw it when I thankfully finished. I would have given it half a star or less if that was an option."
4,Wonderful touching story,"The story itself is beautiful and unforgettable. I would have given it 5 stars, but it has more than a few typographical errors. I read the kindle version, so I don't know if the errors can be found in other published versions. Other than that, it is truly a great story. If you enjoyed any of Anne Rice's Angel Time books, the Witch books, or Memnoch the Devil, you will love this one too."
2,Disappointing,"Rice is a brilliant writer, and her style and ideology is always brilliant, playfully convoluted, and alluring. So why was this book so lifeless and difficult to read? I struggled through the first part, as I have never done with any other contemporary novel (technical manuals, Middle English literature yes), and where was the payoff? At least when I struggled through Dante and The Canterbury Tales, I could at least brag about my accomplishment ;) I will view this book as an experiment and forget it ever happened."
3,just can't......,"I just can't get into this book. I'm trying, because Rice is one of my favourite author. What's wrong with me,? I read the chronicles in neat succession, I was dissapointed with Violin and then Rice completely redeemed herself with 'Feast...'. I don't get how this ghost guy (thing) can just walk into this guy's cabin and the old guy is not even shocked or anything he just acts all normal! i'm waiting for the Black death to happen, I get nauseous when the bones are mentioned! Ok, i'll try again, but another thing, why are all the male characters half bisexuals in her books! (its' true!) off to read now!"
1,I stopped half way through this book and gave up!,I have read every one of Rice's books from Interview with the Vampire forward. I bought this book on her name and reputation alone. That is the last time I will make that mistake. This is an abysmal book. Save your money.
4,biblicly inspiring.,This was one of the most interesting and different books. This book brings into question the significences of life and the after life. Once you start it you can't stop.
1,"It's time to hang it up, Anne...","Don't get me wrong- I think Anne Rice has done some brilliant writing. Unfortuntely, I don't think this book falls into that category. What Rice accomplishes in 387 pages could have been done in 50. There is a lot of repetition, fluff, and long rambling stream-of-conscious type writing here that is frustrating at best, confusing at worst. Pass."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"This is a version of the whole genii in the bottle story. Azriel is one of that sort of supernatural entity, and grows more and more cantankerous and nasty over the years, leading him to be imprisoned over the centuries. His name, of course, is supposed to suggest his demonic nature.He ends up being awakened in modern New York, and becomes involved with a murder, and a history professor that learns his story."
1,what is this??,"I can't even bring myself to chapter two, that is how much i hated chapter one. if a book doesn't get me interested after chapter one, forget it. I give up.I was very disappointed in this, I liked Interview w/ a Vampire and thought I'd read something scary in lieu of Halloween being so close by.This is just pure drivel. I had the book for three years before I picked it up to read it. It was a gift. thank god i didn't spend money on this terrible book. I don't know what she is talking about in it, it's like reading a text book..boring!skip this if you want something scary...this will put you to sleep."
5,MAGNIFICENT!,"Anne Rice places the reader into a unimaginable world! The history she tells in this novel is really something to be admired. Much thought and prep had to have gone into writing this great novel! I will not give the story away-like so many other people, but it is definately worth reading.Truly a great read!"
3,"Unexpected, But Not Bad","I just finished this one a few days ago and I have to say that my feelings are mixed. My thoughts of the cover and title prior to reading it included a more horrific mood. This just goes to show that you can't judge a book by it's cover. Though unexpected, the story wasn't completely dissatisfying. There is the familiar element of the main character relating an incredible tale with every word being recorded. Trials and tribulations afflict Azriel in his search for the answers to this strange existence. Having knowledge as well as the power to peform acts of kindness is most precious. This book was overall a fairly decent read."
3,just mediocre,"Since everybody else has discussed plot, I'm going to skip that. I have read all of the other books Anne Rice has written, and all I have to say about this book, is that for a character whose existence spanned thousands of years, the book is awfully short on details. This story would have been much more interesting if Anne Rice would have stretched it out into at least a couple of books (like Lasher and Taltos) that provided greater detail, insight, and more stories of the experiences Azriel encountered through the ages. Instead, she focused briefly on just a very few time periods and left out chunks of history that could have made for fascinating reading."
3,Servant of the Bones is a great book to read.,"In Anne Rice's number one bestseller, Servant of the Bones, she writes about Azriel, a ghost who is bent on revenge. The book first takes place in the present time, the year 1995, then goes back to anchient Babylon to explain the origin of Azreil and back again. She has a real gift of describing everything so vividly that one would have no trouble seeing it in their mind. The combination of spirits with a sense of mystery really brought the book to life. The book brings to mind the questions often asked about heaven and hell, do they really exsist? To find out this and more read Servant of the Bones and experience the mystery for yourself."
3,"Not the worst, and nowhere near her best...",I have read most of her books and have begun The Witching again just recently. This isnt her worst (and there are a couple) but I just could not get excited about this book. It seemed to repeat its dilemmas alot. She should have focused more on the evil modern day doings. If you have to read all her books then go for it....
1,No... Again?!,"I read all of Anne's books so far. But this one is the worst. It wasn't like Anne's work at all. It's worse than ""Memnoch"". But if you're blind fan of Anne Rice, read it."
3,Hmm...,A generally ok book. It'd be better if it didnt go on so much- it got kinda tedious after a while. And what was the deal with Azriel sleeping with Belkin's dying wife? That bit was totally pointless and rather boring too.
3,Not one of her best,I Love Anne Rice as an author. Yet this book was just boring basically. I am at page 173 and it is just now starting to pick up. In the first 30 pages maybe 50. I read the same thing. I was the oldest son of a merchant. our whole family was of merchant and scribes.... etc etc. Something along those lines. I was hard to keep my interest in this book. If you like anne rice i dont recommened buying this but if you want to read it Just go to the library.
2,A let down after Interview with a vampire and Vampire Lestat,"Before this I had only read Interview and Vampire Lestat - 2 of my favorite all time books. The writing so beautiful and descriptive, the characters so real I was believing in vampires. At times Servant of the Bones had the same passion, but only rarely. Seeing the hardcover on the bargain pile at bookstores was not a good omen. Obviously Rice's heart wasn't in this book as it was with the other 2, and I really struggled to finish."
2,really cool start but then drags on and on and on...........,"i just finished this book yesterday and am i glad it was over coz at first it excited me, but then .......... it got boring and i have to really exert much effort to finished it. last time i get me an anne rice novel."
2,predictable,The description of ancient persian reglion was interesting but the plot was predictable. Main characters have potential but more refinement is needed to improve the story. My recommendation is to skip it!
4,A very good book.,I really enjoyed this book! Azriel is an interesting character and I look forward to a sequel. What happened to Marduk?
3,Azriel,This book is actually a story about the Servant of the Bones named Azriel.What I like about this book is how it sort of preaches about our purpose here on earth which is to love and to learn.I think that Anne Rice was right about that.Anyway the book is a good read...I wouldn't call it one of Rice's worst but it is not one of her best either....
1,Anne Rice meeting her publishers quota?????,"I love the works of Anne Rice. However Servant of the Bones paled in comparision to her other works. The first part is redundant, the second part lacks Rice's famous detail, and the third part...Well, I had to keep swatting myself to stay awake. To any Anne Rice fan who has read the Mayfair witches chronicles, as well as the vampire chronicals...you will be dissapointed. Servant of the Bones lacks the passion, sexuality, and fervor that can be found through out her writing. Overall, I bad choice for me. I was very dissapointed."
1,UNFULFILLING,"I thought this book had a very good story topic, full of potential, but its awkward telling is so jarring that it's nearly impossible to read. What little descriptive character this book has seems out of place and forced. Its as if the editor of the book handed it back to Ms. Rice after reading it and told her to ""...make it more descriptive..."" which she tried to do by merely adding quasi-descriptive comments to the existing text without regard for transition or context values. In addition to this problem, the book suffers from a disjointed feel, as if it hasn't been outlined correctly. These are major failings in my opinion and made the reading of the book so distasteful that I couldn't finish it. In the future I hope that she and her editor are both in more professional frames of mind for her next book."
1,What was she thinking? What was _I_ thinking???,"I've never really gotten into Anne Rice much before. Her only book that I read before was Memnoch, which I actually kind of enjoyed because of the interesting alternate twist it gave to the religious concepts typically believed today. I started reading this book expecting something somewhat exciting and eerie. Right now I'm 3/4 of the way done this book and I can't many books have bored me this badly. The plot seems to crawl along and the characters are not very believeable in the slightest. It's never taken me this long before to read a book and I find myself almost having to force myself to read it on my morning bus ride. Azriel seems to constantly be whining about one thing or another, and the way he flips between loving and hating the other characters in my opinion just doesn't work. I won't make the mistake of bothering with another Anne Rice book after this yawner."
2,It was a very confusing and boring novel,"I love Anne Rice novels. I couldn't put the Witching Hours down. I read it in 3 days. I also loved Cry to Heaven, and I did read the Sleeping Beauty novels, they weren't my favorite, but I did like them. But, Servant of the Bones had a very boring beginning, which was very hard to get through. Once I did get through the beginning the story started to become interesting, but then it took to long to get to another interesting point. I felt like I was reading and reading nothing to get to something interesting. I was very disappointed in this novel and I couldn't finish it. But, not every song on a C.D. is great. Most of the time you only get one good song off of a C.D.. If every author could write a top book, they would be perfect and we all know nobody is perfect. Anne Rice has done an awesome job on most of her books."
2,OH NO!!! ANNE!!! YOU DONE IT AGAIN.... KILL ME PLEASE!!!!!,"This book was better than Memnocht the Devil, which is not saying much, I rated that 4. Anne once again you have finally disappointed me to the levels of hell. This is not an Anne Rice novel at all. The first half was good. It was Rice at her best, but then the editors should have stepped in for ths second half. Unoriginal! Predictable! Boring!!!! While reading this I was so distracted by her copy-cat characters from the novels before-i.e. Esther-Dora, Rachel-Terry, Geogory-Roger,The Elders-The Talamasca, Johnathan-Daniel. IF I really wanted to tell you the truth. Azierl is just a Lestat wantabee.Please ignore this one also..... Forget it!"
2,I really wouldn't recommend this one.,"I'm a little over 100 pages in and I'm not sure I'm going to finish it at all. I love Anne Rice and I am a great fan. However, this could be called ""Interview With the Angel"". Enkidu is spelled with a ""u"" not an ""o"". I'm sorry. I feel like a traitor to say this but Anne should have stopped with ""Tale of the Body Thief"". Memnoch the Devil could have been called ""The Life of Some Guy Lestat Meets in a Bar."" I love you Anne but what's going on? Maybe she's not as depressed as she used to be. Think pain Anne, pain. Unfortunately that's when you're at your best"
4,One of the Best Books I've ever Read!,"I am very young, and I love books. Anne Rice is my favorite,and is a god-send to book readers. Her latest tale is abouta ghost, phantom, whathave you, Azriel. He tells a grippingstory about the gods of Babylonain, and how he was chosen bythe god, Marduk. It is a very well paced, and thought outplot, that leaves the reader gasping for more. I hope thatthis will become a trilogy, for it is superbly written andgripping. The only complaint that I have, is that she goeson and on about the scenery and what he's thinking, and she'sthinking. Well, that's a very minor flaw, and I tried mybest to find another, but to no avail!!!!Hurray for Mrs.Rice, for she is the best writer of ourtime.-Ben Petiprin, age 13."
3,Better get a pair of reading glasses...,"I just finished this book in large print, and I gotta tell you, it just wasn't nearly as good as it was in regular-size-print. So if you're going to read it, get the regular-size-print edition, or at the outside, the rack size paperback because the large print edition really leaves something to be desired. On the other hand, I would give the regular-size-print edition, 4 1/2 out of 5 stars. The regular-size-print edition is a much better book than this one. Keep 'em coming in regular-size-print, Anne!"
