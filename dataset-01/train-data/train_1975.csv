5,A inner strength builder,I was in a very weaking kind of marriage for 26 years and a young man who wished to thank me for a kindness ask me to read this book. I read it and renewed my walk with my Lord and gathered the strength to walk out and say goodbye to a weaking kind of life. I now am a stronger person and able to look others straight in the eye and know that I have worth.
5,Absolutely Excellent,This book is one of the best stories ever told. He gets the point & I actually did what the book says to try & my life has completely turned around. The way I think & act is thanks to this book. Words cannot express my feelings about this book. A MUST READ!!
5,The Greatest Salesman in the World,"This book is the most inspiring book that I have ever read! The principles mentioned in this book have changed my life drastically. I have personally owned six copies of this book (which I have worn out from having read them so much) over the past 20 years of my life and have given many others as gifts. This book doesn't just teach how to be successful as a salesperson, it teachs how to be successful at life, in every endeavor. This book is a must read!"
5,Please do yourself a favor & read it!,The best...most entertaining...most captivating....motivating....moving....wisdom filled book have read in a long time....and so short...how does Og Mandino manage to write such a touching message in so little words... don't know but do know you must read it!
5,Everyone Should Read This Book Regardless of Sales,"This book should be re-titled the greatest person in the world. The lessons taught in this book can be applied to anything and anyone in life regardless if your job includes sales. This book teaches you great life lessons of selling yourself to yourself, believing in yourself, and just being the best possible person you can, without ever faulting."
5,Greatest Book In The World If your in Sales,I first read this thirty years ago and have handed it out to many of my sales people over the years. If you apply the principles it's impossible to fail. Buy The Book!
5,Create sales habits,This book helps new sales people to create successful sales habits. It may be less satisfactory at first but many people who has used this book in my circle has grown to be more successful in sales. A book worth the read.
5,Great life lessons --- so much more than a sales tool!,"I loved this book! It's a gift that I plan to give to all my family and friends. Og Mandino captures some of life's most important lessons - the things that so few know or understand but that are critical to creating a happy, abundant life. Read this book!!!!!"
4,Great,Og Mandino give selfconfidence and a postive attitude. A wonderfull guide to regain confidence in a world of strife & sorrow
5,Introducing 4th generation to this book,"This gift edition was purchased to introduce the 4th generation of my family to this life changing work.Don't be deceived by the title! This book is about success at living - we are ALL salesman, whether our job title represents it or not. We 'sell' everything from ourselves to boss's and co-workers, to ethics for our children, to ideas we support whether secular or religious. Read the book through, and then follow instructions regarding the Ten Scrolls.It WILL change your life.As usual item was shipped and delivered promptly. The Gift edition is a very nice touch and sure to be handed down to more generations."
5,Full of tidbits of wisdom,"I remember having to read this book as an assignment for a JROTC leadership class; 'The Greatest Salesman In The World' is the first book that I can remember that truly impressed me. Og Mandino has written this classic in a language and style that is easily understood by anyone who opens it's covers. Even though the title contains the word salesman, the book contains profound statements that can be applied to any part of life. If people lived their lives by the messages contained within this gem of a book, life would be so much happier for everyone involved. I highly recommend that all people read this book and add it to their libraries."
4,Inspiring,"It was an eye opener. The teachings are actually doable and can be practiced by all. 'That too shall pass', which is the mantra of one of the scrolls, is actually someting I personally try to emulate."
5,I couldn't believe a book could hold so much power.,"In the summer of 94 I made a brave move and decided that I would sell books with The Southwestern Company in the US for the summer. I was just a college student in the UK so this was a BIG step for me. It was quite simply the toughest thing I have ever done. Thankfully SW give you all the tools you need to deal with such a tough task - one of those was ""The Greatest Salesman in the World"" by Og Mandino, it quite literally gave me a new perspective on my summer and life in general. It inspired me, gave me the will to keep going and helped give me a positive outlook on life that I carry with me to this very day. I must have read that book a hundred times that summer and thank God I did! This book is a fantastic inspiration and I wholeheartedly reccomend it to Salespeople and non-salespeople alike."
3,"An Okay Book, but Watch out","This book is basically one big sales pitch for Christian values. The first part of the book, (i.e. the first 40 pages) is useless, working up towards the meat of the book - the scrolls. The lessons from the scrolls are quite useful, but Og writes in a way that waxes biblical. The last part of the book brings in Paul and Jesus, and that's where it lost me. As a Jew, I don't believe Jesus was the son of G-d and it put a suspicious light on everything Og was delivering. In the end it made him sound like a preacher, which is fine if you're Christian."
2,I was not motivated at all.,"I bought this book the same reason that I bought Think and grow rich by Napoleon Hill. It was reccommended in all my other financial and self motivational books. I was very disapointed. It is a story of perserveering, giving to charity, thinking positive. It set in biblical times which made it a hard and boring read for me."
5,"This Book Should Be Rates As, ""Book Of The Millennium""","Mandino does a brilliant job of giving dignity and respect to the ancient profession of selling, which has been maligned and misunderstood by all too many people. Mandino's extended parable seems simple and direct, but the story turns out to be deceptively profound, for the author uses several clever plot twists to teach readers the ten key principles that will empower them to become successful in sales and in life.The book will surprise you...and delight you.It's short enough to read in an hour or two, but the message will stay with you for a lifetime. The Greatest Salesman in the world is proof that big things come in small packages."
4,UNEXPECTED,"I am a sales manager at an auto dealership and I purchased this for all my salesman and myself. We all really liked it. It is not about ""technique"", it is about attitude and life."
5,The Greatest Miracle in the World,This is an awsome cd and the author is the best. The shiping was great as well. I got this shipment 2 days before I expected it.
4,Great book: Would recommend to friends!,"I really like the book. Very inspiring. I am starting my own business and needed the words of inspiration. I am not particularly happy about the 2 1/2 weeks it took to receive the book but overall, the book is amazing! I think next time I will just go to Borders."
5,The Absolute Best Book In The World!,"This is the absolute best book in the world! This book contains everything you need to succeed. You will be astonished! I guarantee you!If you want to thrive in this world and you want the same for all the people in your life, purchase this book for everyone! It's life changing!Selena D. ValentineCEOJoys of Happiness"
5,Read with care,"I have always found self-help books wishy-washy and self-absorbed, but this book touched me. I am a mere amatuer as compared to some of the people who have posted here, I've only worn out one copy and am looking for a second, but since I'm only 18 I guess I'm off to a good start. The book is not about selling, but about guiding pricipals to success. I must confess i did not follow the books instructions, I merely reread the entire thing as often as I have time. There is a quote from it in my college essay, maybe I'll get lucky and get someone who's read it before. I would recommend it to anyone, fast-food worker to CEO."
4,The Greatest Salesman in the World,"I gave the ""The Greatest Salesman in the World"" as agift and the person liked it. I have not read it."
4,Salesman,"This is a nice short, quick read with a feel good ending. There is nothing spectacular or new about the philosophy found in the book, but it is the kind of good-heartedness that sometimes can use a little reminder."
5,"Good book, good habits to develope",This little book is a salesmans bible. It is full of good advise and principles we all would be better off practicing. I recommend this book to anyone.
5,Full of wisdom,"This book is full of many timeless adages and inspiring tales. The text is easy to quote and a quick read, yet a book that can be read over and over."
5,worked great and got it a wonderful price!!,"I needed a mount for my 60 inch samsung tv, and I was not too sure because it wasn't samsung product, but my husband was very for this product because of the price, (another reason I wasn't so sure of) but when it arrived we put it up right away, we searched for the wall beams behind our drywall & we secured it on the beams. Our tv weighs about 60 lbs and we live upstairs so everytime someone walks next to our apt. or down the stairs it shakes the entire building, and I am sure that is not a good thing, but the tv is extremely firm and is holding up great, it doesn't shake and we can tilt it to the angle we want up or down and that is a plus!! It fit percectly with the back of our tv.I would say the down side was the work searching for the beams and the trash on the carpet from the drilling into the wall, other than that I am very pleased with this product, I do recomend it!!"
3,Functional but not the best,"I purchased this mount for a 50"" Plasma that was retired to bedroom, and purchased another mount for new 65"" at local ""warehouse club"" for $79. The thin gauge of metal and lower quality of components in this package was readily apparent in comparing the two. As some others have commented here, we had a lag bolt that snapped apart during install: cheap. I wouldn't trust this thing to TVs over 50"" and would recommend spending a little more on a better made product."
4,Don't be fooled by the low pricing!,"This is a large mount for large flatscreens. The packaging is solid. It is no more cheap than any of the wall brackets that you pay a $100 or more for in the store. The instructions are clear and concise. The absolute best part about it is that it comes with just about every screw available that you might need for attaching it both to your flat screen and to your wall. I had it installed in about an hour or so.Caution.... Do not use the built in little bubble level that is mounted to the wall bracket. Get yourself either a good spirit level or use a laser level to put it on your wall. That little built in bubble level is useless.I would recommend this product over and over again. I have a 70"" Sharp LED mounted to the wall now and I couldn't be more pleased."
5,worth the wait,"it is great. it also comes with a built-in level so its easier to make it straight. it took a little longer than my other items, but it was definitely worth it."
4,good but ... wrong brand!,"Digicom : PMA-5041 Plasma & LCD TV Flat Wall Mount Universal Design for 40"" to 70"" Displaysreceived this, and not what was shown for sale.1. Good price for the item.2. Too bad for them not to say when processed the order, and the same day I received it by UPS, I received the e-mail that had already been sent, hellooooo! .3. Not receive the same mark shown in the photo, just received an equivalent. Have not used it but I hope to be of good quality. Luck!"
5,Mi-Mount-it,Got it right when we were supposed to and very easy to mount! Looks and works great! Why pay what they are charging in the stores when you can get the same thing for alot less.
4,**DONT USE THE BOLTS**,"So when I bought this Mount ""Mi-Mount-it! 40 - 70 Inch Tilt Mount for Universal Plasma/LCD Flat Panel TVs, Model No.:MI-303L"" I was kinda skeptical about it because of the price being so low, but when I got it and opened it up I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the metal and all of the bolts. I had read some of the reviews before buying and noticed that some had said to not use the bolts that came with the mount, but seeing them I thought how could these bolts not work out. When you see them you will understand. So I got to work, I followed all instructions and got everything level and began to screw in the bolts. Not using very much power at all I broke two bolts halfway in the wall, boy was I upset. TAKE MY ADVICE GO AND BUY NEW BOLTS FROM ANY HARDWARE STORE it will only cost 10 dollars at most. After buying new bolts and remeasuring and pre-drilling all new wholes I mounted my 70 inch Sharp. Dont be cheap buy new bolts!!!"
2,It is not the one that I thought to be,The Mount that I received was not the one that is shown here. If this one is not in the stock then need to be removed from the list.The one that got is somewhat similar. It was difficult for me to attach to the wall and the tilt adjust knob was broken before I actually hang the TV. Not recommend for big screen TV.
2,Dishonest Description,"They claim this product to be less than two inches from the wall. After mounting it, we discovered it's nearly three inches and looks silly having our plasma sticking out so far. We will be getting a replacement."
2,junk,came with no directions! screws are junk had 2 go buy new ones! I have a 22in tv and it wouldnt stay on the mount and fell off n hit 7 year old in the head~
3,Arrived broken but does the job,"This mount is very sturdy and easy to setup. The holes lined right up with 60"" Vizio. Good overall construction.Negative: The built in bubble level was cracked and had 2 holes in it! The shipping box and all other contents were in great shape so dont try and blame UPS. The bubble, mounted on a piece of metal, inside a box, cushioned and inside of a bigger box... this thing was obviously packed in broken condition. maybe this rant is for the seller/shipper and not neccesarily for the product.made it work."
2,Not good for large flat panel tvs,"This mount, while heavy duty and sturdy, is not good for large (over 42"") flat screen tvs because it does not give enough clearance behind the television. The brackets do not extend away from the wall very far, so the tilt is minimal. Will re-mount our tv in the future with a different bracket."
5,Great mount and value,"I bought this mount for my 60"" Sharp LCD TV a year ago, and it has been great. Instructions were clear, the hardware included was plenty strong, and it's been everything I've needed. The tilt mechanism is a little awkward to reach with a large tv, but I only needed to set it once and it has not moved. Also, it helps to have a socket wrench to tighten the lag bolts, as it worked very well."
4,Very Satisfied,"Item is very solid and had no problems installing and hanging my 98lbs 60"". I did go ahead and purchase new bolts for it as I didn't want to take a chance on the originals breaking as I've read in previous reviews that some do and delivery was right on time."
5,Great mount,Does what it supposed to do and that is mount your TV to the wall. But at a fraction of the store price.Very happy.
4,works like it should,easy to install. only issue was the built in level was not accurate. verify level with 4ft level before installing.
3,Check the holes on the back of your TV first before buying,"I have to say first I return this product because even if its description says it fit 40-70 inch TVs, it doesn't fit my 60"" Pioneer. It may fit most of models, but you better measure the holes on the back of your TV before ordering it."
5,"For my 70""","Purchased this to hang my 70"" LED. Great product. Very strong and durable. Came with all the screws to hang and made things easy."
2,"Overall, ok quality...","It has a hand-made look to it, and I don't know if it's supposed to look a little battle worn, but the paint isn't perfect either. It is sturdy, and the overall look of it is close to accurate. It's not really pretty enough to be a display piece, but it's also not safe enough to swing around, being that it's made entirely of metal. It's for my kid, and he will recognize it immediatly, and probably really like it, but if it was for me I'd be kind of dissapointed."
1,Unprofessional Design,Its Looks So fake!i got a REAL one at a shop in TN and its a 100% replicaIf you buy this and think it looks real then you dont pay attention to the genius design of the REAL blade on the game.dont buy it it looks fake
2,Not Good At All,"I regret buying this.. even for only $13.VERY LIMITED OT wordsThe font is absolutely hugeI hate to admit it, but you could probably learn more from a decent study Bible."
4,Rommel for the dummies,My knowledge of 2nd world war is quite limited so started with Winston Churchill and then moved on to Rommel. I had some distant relatives who fought in the war under the British command in Africa and to them Rommel was an enigma. He was the hot topic of most of the stories so getting to know about Rommel was mandatory.Considering the size of the book I think Charles Douglas-Home has done justice in portraying Rommel as a real blood and flesh person rather than an enigmatic legend. He is able to differentiate Rommel as a German army officer different from the SS culture.Rommel was not judgmental but instinctive. Home compares Rommel to his counterparts in the British army and you can see how flexible Rommel was in his planning. Home also compares Rommel to the other German generals - as you will notice that Rommel never saw the grand picture but was more preoccupied with his own battle.This is a very elementary book on Rommel and should be a good one for starters
1,Increased Electric bill,Our Electric bill went up about 300.00 this past month after using 2 Edenpures. House is well insulated so I called electric company and they told me it was the EdenPures. They are not an efficient user of electricity as the company wants you to believe the electric company told me. I tried to ask for a refund but it was 30 days outside the 60 day refund. They could replace them but why would I want that ? So I would say not to buy them with the idea you will save on your electric bill. Wish I had read these reviews before I bought and do not know what to do with them now. They set as a room decoration I guess.
3,Not as impressed as I thought I would be.,"Yes, It puts out heat, and doesn't seem to dry out the air as much as a regular electric space heater...but our electric bill is 100 - 150 dollars more per month when we have it on. It's basically just used for zone heating at our house. Unless you place it close to the thermostat the LP furnace kicks on just as much. We have had ours for 2 years and just had to replace the bulbs, which was over 100 dollars."
1,Edenpure disappointment !!!,"Do not waste your time or hard earned money on an Edenpure heater. After I received mine it worked for a grand total of 4 hours. After I repackaged the defective heater and returned it, they tell me it will take 5-10 days for my refund to be credited to my account. Why should I have to wait for a refund? They sold me a defective heater. I should have read more reviews before purchasing junk from this mercenary band of thieves !!"
1,BEWARE!,"I purchased an edenpure heater about 2 years ago and I brought it out this year and it almost burned my house down. When I started it this year it seemed to start fine but after a couple hours of running I noticed that it had got so hot that it melted the plastic off of the front of the unit. I shut it down and proceeded to call the company, just to get a run around and they were not even concerned about the dangerous heater. After arguing on the phone for an hour with three different people, they said that if I paid postage to send it back they would replace it with another one. I sent it in to them, but all I recieved back was a letter that said my warranty was out and they would not replace it. They got one over on me because now they have the faulty heater and my money. BEWARE!"
1,Worst case of hucksterism I've ever seen.,"I can't believe these people are still in business. I was moved to warn y'all upon seeing a full-page ad in Parade magazine. My credentials: I am an electronics Engineer, specializing in radio stations and do efficiency calculations and thermal management exercises every day. HEAR THIS: Electric heaters are 100 percent efficient. This is NOT to say it's the cheapest, just that it's a perfect conversion from kWh to BTU. ""Watts is watts"". Every kilowatt-hour is converted entirely to heat. A $29.99 1500-watt heater from Target will do the EXACTLY same job as this 1500-watt, light-bulb-operated piece of Chinese junk. 1500 watts from any heater will put-out 5121.6 British Thermal Units (BTUs) worth of heat. Period. And no, the Amish fireplace is worthless, as well. Buy a heater from Home Depot, Lowes or Target, and pat yourself on the back for not wasting $300.00. Report these thieves. Hope this helps someone..."
2,High Electric Bills,"I have the EdenPure Gen3 Model 1000. It was recommended to me by a contractor doing work on my home (he meant well). What a waste of money. My electric bills are now consistently 250.00 a month. Might as well sell it, and buy a cheaper heater which will do the same job as the EdenPure. My electric bills sure can't get any worse!"
2,Great While it Lasted,"I bought the Edenpure 6 months ago. It kept a small room at a comfortable temperature. A couple weeks ago it inexplicably stopped working. I plugged it in and nothing happened. I contacted customer support, and I was advised to send the unit back, at my expense, for a replacement. The warranty only lasts 90 days.The customer service rep. did not sound surprised to hear that my unit suddenly stopped working. It sounds like the concept behind the unit is good, but it's poorly made. I will not buy another product from this company again."
1,No Plug in Heater is worth $300...NOT a ONE,"This unit selling at a 'discount"" price sells for $300....$300...$300!!!!!Any plug in heater that plugs into a standard home outlet will max at 1500 watts and 5100 btu's. If you want to pay $300 for a 1500 watt heater, go ahead! But you can get one that heats just as good for $30. Unless this heater is gold plated, it's massivley overpriced."
2,HEAT BULBS NEED REPLACING EVERY 3 YEARS,BOUGHT UNIT 6 YEARS AGO. USED VERY OCCASIONALLY. HEAT BULBS NEED REPLACING. CO. SAYS 3 YEARS LIFE NORMAL. QUESTIONABLE QUALITY.
1,Expensive heat,"You can get the same heat by buying a couple of toasters and using them instead of this ridiculously expensive, fancy-talking heater! All of the window dressing and quasi-scientific talk will not change the fact that you are simply converting electrical energy into heat. I'd suggest you look elsewhere, if you need a heater, for a simple one with good safety features. Or better yet, put your money into weatherstrip and insulation and skip the heater!"
1,Rip-Off,You can buy a heater just as good or better than the EdenPure for less than $60. Of course you can cut your energy bill in half with it or any other small electric heater. Just heat only one room in your house and keep the rest closed off. Move the heater from room to room with you. Never mind the fact that your water pipes are likely to freeze. See the 5-star reviews to find either an EdenPure dealer or one of their very gullible customers.
1,You've been deceived !,"The folks at Eden pure are real quick to say that you will slash your heating bills?Bull!! I just got my electric bill, and it is 2 times the cost it usually is!These units are just fancy spaceheaters, that everyone knows use up a huge amount of energy..And did you know, that it costs twice as much to heat w electric than it does w a natural gas burning furnace? These units might be good to use for a very short amount of time, but under no circumstances should anyone use it on a regular basis or the electric company will own you! and there was very little change in my gas heating bill.EdenPURE GEN3 Model 1000 Quartz Infrared Heater"
1,Sucks!,This Eden Pure heater was awful. It would not heat a small room at all. The only time you felt warmth is when you put your hand right up against it. I would not recommend it. The only good part about the heater is the remote. Sucks!
1,Yearly headache,"We have owned a Eden pure for going on 4 yrs. every year we have to send it back for another refurbished piece of junk. Problems range from not heating up to shutting off and not powering back up. Every year we are told by the customer service department that most customers don't have this problem. However the first time we had to ship it back the UPS dealer says ""I will see you again next yr. You have no idea how many of these are returned every year"". Should have known then to get my money back."
1,Over priced electric heater,"Save your money. Here is the basic facts on electric heat. For every watt of electricity you consume you can only get at the most slightly over 3 btu's of heat and no more. There is no mystery about this and electric heat, period. What ever the btu's these are rated for you can go to Walmart and get a heater for a fraction of the cost and do the very exact same thing. Don't believe me ask an electrician."
2,Safe but expensive,I have the Eden Pure and paid over $400 for it. It is safe to run and will warm a room but boy will it run up your electric bill. It cost me more to run this heater than it does an AC window unit in the heat of the summer in the South. Wish I had never bought it. After I got this month's electric bill I am unplugging it and retiring it. I have gas heat and bought a Honeywell raditor type heater and have been told by a relative it is just as safe and much cheaper to run!
1,Very Dissappointed,"I received an Eden PURE from my parents as a Christmas gift. It died in a little over a month. We returned it and I was given a ""new"" Eden PURE. I have good reason to believe it is a re-manufactured product due to a couple of scratches, used batteries in the remote, and different packaging. This one lasted less than a year and now makes a horrible noise if in operation for more than a few minutes. I contacted the company and since the warranty has expired I would have to pay for the repair. I also didn't get the heat I expected out of it. It was rated to heat up to 900 sq ft, but in a 600 or so square ft room I freeze and have to use an additional heat source which pretty much defeats the purpose. So whatever it recommends as sq ft coverage, I would cut that in half. Personally I wouldn't purchase this product again."
1,Edenpure Junk,"Edenpure heaters are junk. My heater(Gen 3)went out in January but did not get around to writting them thill February and the said to bad you warrantee ran out 10 days ago. At the money the charge they should do all that the claim, however they don't. A truley very poor heater. You are paying for their advertizing not a well made or effective heater."
4,EdenPure Heater,"We like the heater's compact size. For its size it heats the house very well. The real test will come later this winter. It was delivered in a timely manner and at acheaper price than other sites we checked. I like the fact it is on wheels, so it is easy to move around, or move out of the way if we are not using it."
1,misleading claims,"The 300 dollar Edenpure heater gives the same amount of heat (in BTU's) per watt of electric used as a 20 dollar K-mart electric heater. If your only concern is heat, then don't waste your money on the Edenpure. Of course safety should be a primary concern here and some cheap electric heaters are not very safe. But, ANY electric heater can be unsafe if not used as directed."
1,always broken,"We bought 3 edenpure heaters. One week before the warranty ran out, one of them stopped working. We were able to get it replaced, but could tell it was not a new unit. Another one stopped working within a few months after the warranty expired. The third one was never put into use until a month ago so not sure his long it will last. The replaceme one stopped working after using for about a total of 90 days. The second one still works but is only used in winter if we r gone overnight, which has been a total of approximately 30 nights. I would not recommend this heater. Now we r just hoping we can find a repair kit."
1,All electric heaters are 100% efficient,"Keep that in mind when you think about paying hundreds of dollars for plug-in space heater. They're all limited in power by the capabilities of the ordinary wall outlet, and they all convert 100% of their electrical power input into heat. They cheapest heater you can buy is just as efficient as an expensive one, and they all are required to have safety switches to shut them off if they tip over or overheat. The only differences are aesthetics, whether you want a fan or not, whether you like radiant (glowing element) or convective (oii-filled) heat, and so on. I won't name names, but some brands make absolutely ridiculous claims and apparently succeed at tricking naive people into spending $200-$400 for functionality that's available for $20-$40 at your local big-box store."
2,edenpure heater,"i have seen advertisements on this heater about how it saved so much money and how cheap there electric bills are well these people that they must have to pay are full of it,i bought one of these heaters and my electric bill jumped 200.00 hum some savings, so guess what it will be in my next yard sale but i promise i wont lie to the seller and till them how cheap it is to use, dont buy this unless you like paying high electric bills."
1,DO NOT BUY EDEN PURE HEATERS!,"We bought two and they worked for 1 year for one and 1 year and two months for the other. Have called over 50 times but have never been able to get through. At this point we have gone to state senator and hopefully we will get a positive resolution to this defective product.In other words, if you want to throw away money give it to your favorite charity and buy the Honeywell or Delonghi Safe heater(80.00)"
1,Didnt Even Last One Season,"I bought this heater, and it heated very well ---- for 8 two-hour uses. Then stopped. I wouldn't go near an Edenpure product. Save your money, and buy elsewhere."
1,No savings using this heater,"We've been using this heater rather than our electric heat about 80% of the time, and our electric bill actually went up! Very disappointed, and when I saw what my husband paid for it, I wanted to kill him! Now we're stuck with a big, over priced space heater. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY."
1,Save your money,"We bought this heater directly from eden pure. We had 1 heater that operated for approx. 3 months then quit. Contacted Eden Pure and sent that one back. They returned us a ""reconditioned"" heater that operated for approx 1 month then quit. We contacted them repeatedly and they said the warranty was only for the original. 4 months heat for approx. 400 dollars and the pain of dealing with eden pure is a waste of money and time. Save yours."
1,Terrible!!!!!!!!,"We have had our unit for 3 years and it has been a sham. The unit failed, the first season and had to pay to send it in for repair. The second season the unit failed again!! More cost to send in and repair. It failed again today 5-7-2009. We only heat 550 square feet and it is only auxillary heat. Never again will I buy the Eden Pure or the SunTwin heaters."
1,over hype performance very poor,"This is an over priced piece of garbage. We've owned one for just over 3 years and it doesn't have a thermostat, it's either on all the time or it's off(they say it has one). Plus it doesn't save electricity. We have a Delongi coil radiator that we paid $40 for that works better and actually has a functioning thermostat. Read Consumer Reports and don't buy it."
1,EdenPure Rip Off,"Can't believe we are as old as we are and as dumb as we were. We purchased three of these high pricedthings! Didn't do anything more than a small ceramic heater would have and now after only very little use none of them work. One of them won't even turn on. Don't know why we didn't do more research, but bought them at the height of their popularity and maybe people didn't know yet. Take our advice...don't buy one of these!"
1,DONT BUY THIS,ITS a POS!!! don't buy it it dont work. We had ours last year it sorta worked then now that they are a year old all they do is blow out cold air.
2,My $70 space heater works better!!,"My oh My! I guess this is what I get for watching informercials, right? My friend had a problem with his home heating system and my dad bought an edenpure a couple of years ago and it did a great job, so we thought it would be a good solution to the problem for the winter. NOT!! Bought this unit for $397, and right out of the box you have to practically sit in front of the heater in order to get any warmth! So, you can enjoy your day in warmth if you do nothing else but sit in front of the heater. He was lucky if the temperature had risen 1 degree at the end of the day, running at full power, with no drafts in the room and the room being small. My $70 heater did a better job. Jeez."
1,Bad choice,"This heater does nothing as advertised.I am heating a 340 sq.ft. insulated room in Florida,to 70 degrees. to do this last year I used a small $49.00 heater from Lowe's.This year I am using a $350.00 Eden pure which runs all the time to accomplish the same thing. This is a bad waste of money.Oh did I say my power cost is about $50.00 higher. So much for energy efficiency."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this heater a few years ago based on their incredible marketing - I really wanted to believe it did everything they said it would.It did not reduce any heating bills. What it did do, for one season, was produce nice heat in a small space.Now, a couple of years later, it's not working - no heat comes out, just cool air, and it shuts itself off for unknown reasons (my electrical system is brand new).Obviously, this heater was a waste of money - you can get a much better one for much less - there are good suggestions in other reviews. I have recently bought the Honeywell baseboard heater, which is incredible, and I have used a really nice ceramic heater."
2,No Better Than Other Space Heaters,I purchased the edenpure 1000 and found that the main difference between it and other space heaters is price. I own several other space heaters including one 1500 watt unit with a fan and one 1500 watt oil filled radiator style heater. I can't tell any real difference in the heating ability of any of them except one thing...price. I purchased an oil filled radiant heater from Target for $28 which seems to do just as well as the edenpure which cost hundreds of dollars more. Not a good value.
1,Edenpure a Ripoff,"We bought an Edenpure and were very disappointed. It does NOT do a good job of heating even a mid-sized room, and cost WAYYY too much. Save your money."
1,EdenPure Heaters,"I am on my 4th EdenPure heater and NONE OF THEM HAVE WORKED. I received and EdenPure 500 as a gift in December 2007. It did not heat the small room adequately - and I kept having to reset it. I called and had it replaced with an EdenPure 1000. That one didn't work any better and it went off constantly. I replaced it again - and that one didn't work either. I am now on my 4th replacement which is a different model - with a remote - that I received in September 08. That one didn't even turn on. I am now told that the warranty is over - based on the FIRST ONE - not the replacement units. This one will go in the junk yard. Save your money. Go to Home Depot or Lowe's. Their heaters work and you can buy 5 heaters for what the EdenPure costs! If there was a ""minus star"" Iwould have chosen that."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THE EDENPURE HEATER!!!!!,"I purchased 3 Edenpure Heaters direct from the manufacturer. All broke shortly after the warranty ran out. I tried contacting the company for repair, but got the run around. Save your Money!!! Do not purchase this product!!!!!!"
1,1500 watts of energy is the max,These are well marketed and silly to own as they are 1500 watts like all portable heaters.That is the max they are allowed to manufacture so household electric can run a heater safelyI have seen these in homes and appear impressive. But can heat no better or worse than most other space heaters. The little Polonis (spell) were well received when they entered the market noisy in my opinion. To spend hundreds on a space heater thinking you will save on your gas bill is not going to happen to help in patio rooms etc.. or cold areas in you home any space heater will do this adequatelyGood luck
1,Terrible Product,Don't buy any Eden pure heaters. I have two heaters one like this one and another. This one didn't work right off the bat. Had to send in to fix and it broke again before winter was over. It is now in the trash can. Check the bulb prices to replace one if it goes out. Trust me a ordinary person can't do it! My husband who can do anything could barely get it apart. Just pay your regular heat bill these are not worth the money......Biggest waste of money I ever experienced!
2,Very noisy,"I purchased the EdenPure Gen3 Model 1000 as a supplemental heater for our family room. The unit I received had a high pitched whistling sound when running. I thought it was defective so I contacted edenpure for a replacement. The company sent me a return label by mail and shipped a replacement unit. However, the replacement unit also has the same high pitched whistling noise as the original unit. The company also ""repaired"" the original unit and shipped it back to me giving me two units that whistle. I contacted the company and they mailed me a return lable for the original ""repaired"" unit to be shiped back to them. The unit is so loud that it can be heard in the background above the normal sound of the TV. It can not be used while you are trying to sleep as it is actually painful to the eardrums."
1,Heater crapped out after minimal use,"This product is a bunch of hot air. We have had it for 3 yrs and only turn it on in my son's room in the winter and only overnight. You figure 3-4 months out of the year and just for 10 hrs a night. The heater has barely been used and now doesn't work. I called the ""service"" line and their big fix was rinsing the filter and turning it on again (not the problem). Their next suggestion was taking it to a repair shop or buying replacement bulbs ($40) as that ""may"" be the problem. Of course the heater is out of warranty. I have a $80 plug in heater in my other son's room that works great. This product is a POS and not worth the price-DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"
2,"Decent, but not great. Does not work as advertised!","So my wife and I bought one of these about a month ago. It worked well for a few days and when the colder weather began to hit, it struggled. It still runs well, but we were trying to use it to replace or completely abandon our OIL furnace. It DOES NOT HEAT 1000 sq. feet (because I live in a 1000 sq. foot home.) It will heat a couple hundred sq. feet in a small room. We are currently using it in our office and it seems to be doing the job. Eventually we will need to buy more heater(s) but are not prepared to go with Edenpure. This heater is good for heat, but is not worth the crazy price.Don't trust Bob Vila or the guy from Home Improvement!"
1,Do Not Buy This Product,"We bought the Eden Pure Gen 4~We were told it would be shipping to us in three days~We order it on December 1st and just got it on December 24th~(this is after making many call to see what was going on, the company told us that do to the overwheling demand they could not keep there promise)We very excited to plug it in and let the heat come into our home~No heat unless you move it from room to room~Our home is only 940sq ft~The product also makes a humming noise and it is rather hard to fall asleep~I am a heavy sleeper but my husband is not, he wakes up often from the noise~He also has to get up at 4am to go to work~My floor heater that we paid 49.00 for puts out more heat then the Eden Pure~We have box this ""scam"" up and are sending it back as I write this~Please do not fall for this~Just go to your local hardware store and buy something reasonable and way cheaper!!!"
2,5 bulbs not 6,"Beware of GEN3 made in China. I noticed mine was not heating well enough on a cold night. I thought maybe a bulb was burned out.Opened the side panel and discovered there were only five bulbs instead of six. Called customer service and explained situation, they sent me a return label to ship back heater. Three weeks later unpack refurbished and inspected heater, works well with moderate temperature. Last night temperature drops below 40 and heater just feels like it's not totally heating room. Open up side panel today to inspect and discover again only five bulbs were there should be six. There are not any wires to show that there ever was six bulbs. Called customer service again, they are sending me a return label again to send back unit. Is there no accountability? I see the inspection stickers that are initialed by inspectors I guess they never even look inside the units! Spring is coming soon."
1,highly disapointed,"I bought the first one from a distributor in Ohio. My house lost heat while the eden pure was running on high heat. I took the temp blowing out of the heater and it was betwenen 90 to 100 degrees. The distributor told me it should be around 190 degrees. I sent that one back, and bought another locally. I did worse. After it blew 100 degree air for fifteen minutes it blew freezing cold air for a hour.... Its a waste of money. You are much better getting a couple of $40 heaters from walmart."
1,Eden Pure is over-hyped junk,"I bought the Eden Pure 1000XL 2 yrs. ago and it is presently a DOORSTOP. Who ever is giving reviews above one star [I couldn't find a star with only one peak to choose from]for this product, either works for the company or lives in Belize.Immediately, go back to Amazon and pick out the cheapest heater [reconditioned is good] you can find and buy that; it will be 10x better than any EdenPure product and you have saved yourself 97% on the cost."
3,SO FAR SO GOOD,"WE JUST PURCHASED THE EDENPURE FOR OUR BASEMENT, OUR SON, DAUGHTER INLAW AND GRANDSON ARE LIVING WITH US AND THE BASEMENT IS A LITTLE COLD, WE NEEDED SOMETHING A LITTLE EXTRA TO KEEP IT A LITTLE WARMER DOWN THERE THAT WOULD BE COOL TO THE TOUCH AND COULD SIT ON THE CARPET WITHOUT BURNING IT. AND SO FAR IT IS WORKING GREAT. IT IS ALL ABOUT EXPECTATIONS AND WHAT YOU NEED OUT OF THAT PRODUCT YOU ARE BUYING AND WHAT YOU USE IT FOR. EDENPURE IS WORKING FOR US SO FAR, WE DIDNT BUY IT TO HEAT A WHOLE HOUSE OR TO BRING DOWN ELECTRIC BILLS. OUR MAIN CONCERN WAS THAT IT WAS SAFE AND COOL TO THE TOUCH AND STILL ADD WARMTH TO ONE ROOM. I PLAN ON WRITING ANOTHER REVIEW AFTER WE HAVE HAD THIS PRODUCT FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS."
4,works great for us,the edenpure gen 3 worked great for us here in pa in the winter months of 08 and 09but 1 thing i think what ppl r over looking in the instruction is the humidity in you place where u r heating should b 40 to 50%we tried it and it was a beatiful thing .
3,"Nice Heater, but","For the price you would expect something really fantastic. However, this isn't the case. We were given one for Christmas and while it does keep the room at a desirable temperature it doesn't give the warm comfy heat that I expected from such a high priced heater. In the back of the unit it has a removable filter that can be washed and reused. This heater is nice looking and quiet, but for the money I was disappointed in that it doesn't blow that really hot and heated air that was expected even on the highest setting."
4,Homecoming Friends Live at from Atlanta Georgia,"""All Day Singin"" at the Dome"" was filmed at the spectacular Georgia Dome in Atlanta. The concert started strong with the Homecoming Friends singing robust arrangements of ""On Jordan's Stormy Banks"" and ""I Am Bound for the Promised Land"" to an appreciated, energetic, enthusiastic audience of thousands. This was followed by a solid rendition of ""I've Got That Old Time Religion in My Heart"" featuring Anthony Burger in a piano solo.The concert featured favorite groups and artists who are or have been residents in Georgia or have been impacted by their music. I always enjoy the Gaither Vocal Band numbers. In this concert they were featured singing: ""Satisfied"" and ""I Believe in a Hill Called Mount Calvary."" Other favorites of mine are: Ivan Park, Jake Hess, John Starnes, and a reading done by J. D. Sumner.Worship, Inspiration, and Entertainment - All in all a wonderful concert."
1,not satisfied,"I checked the picture shown on the website and I was sure that I saw ""made in German"" on the box of the kit. But when I received the kit, there was no such line and the pan is made from China. I felt deceived."
4,Very practical,I'm only about 1/3 into the book. I'm reading it slowly on purpose as it allows me to work on a couple of new skills at a time. I know I have improved my listening skills in a significant way. It's well written and very practical.
4,"People Skills: How to Assert Yourself, Listen to Others, and Resolve COnflicts",ook came in great condition on time and well pacjkaged. I was sent a confirmation stating that the order was received and of the correct arrival date. I am pleased .
1,Not a practical handbook for workplace situations.,"This book had been required reading a vocational course that covered workplace communication. It didn't cover one important aspect (or *the* most important aspect): handling organisational politics. For example, it's impossible to be ""genuine"" in an organisation full of employees jockeying for postion and power. Unless you're at a level where your Company's implied message is that it's not your place to be aware of its machinations.Of course, not tutoring the reader on such things is a political move in itself. Bosses won't look kindly upon a training institution that recommends books that enlightens their workers too much."
3,Better writing and structure would've helped,"This is one of the few books I almost stopped reading midway through. Although there were some worthwhile concepts and step-by-step how to's, it was a bit of a slog lacking writing style and in need of more stuctural clarity. Nonetheless, I've tried out some of the techniques and perhaps have even had a communications breakthrough. But I sure wish it had been more enjoyable to read and clearer structure would make it easier to refer back to."
4,The techniques don't change - we just need to practice!,Dr. Bolton gives timely and proven assertion and communication skills in this book. I found it helpful and used the techniques (or tried). I need more practice but would recommend this book highly.
1,Does he really expect people to talk like this?,"I've been around a bit, and have NEVER encountered ANYBODY who communicates the way this book advocates. Most people would laugh you off the block if you started interacting with them the way Bolton suggests, and it's extremely nieve to think that people will accept you as he suggests they will. What people need is a communications book for surviving REALITY, as it is now, not for how it should be."
5,Should be a mandatory read for everyone...period!,"I have more books than I can count on all of my appendages regarding communication & relationships. I use them all, but this one book has pulled it all togther for me showing me that my problem really boils down to my not being 'assertive.' I grew up in a religous family and was taught that I must always take care of others before myself...that anger was bad, etc. I now 'see' it clearly for what it is and health is now coming back to my being. I've purchased two of these books and use one to loan out to others. If I thought it would do any good, I'd get one for each member of my family, but the saying holds true, ""you can lead a horse to water but you can't make them drink."" Too bad."
4,Mastering Communication,"Bolton does a good job of teaching communication strategies. He identifies ""high risk"" responses -- words that put up barriers between people and lead to resentment and anger. He also discusses the art of reflective listening, reading body language, and, finally, assertiveness. He correctly states that being assertive will, on occasion, bring you into conflict with others. The book instructs you on how to deftly handle conflict and defensiveness. This is where the tough skills of listening and communicating come into play.Bolton's writing style is steady and clear, but not especially lively. That makes the book somewhat of a chore to read, despite the good information contained therein. I would give it 5 stars for content alone, but 3 stars for presentation. Odd, in fact, that a book on communication fails to maintain an interesting tone."
5,Skills that Make A Difference,"People Skills is a book that I wish I had read as a young person starting out in life. The concepts and skills that are taught in this book have made a big difference in my life, even though I did not learn the skills until later in my career. (People Skills is the basis for a wonderful workshop - Leadership Communication Skills - that I attended as a mid-career adult.) I highly recommend this excellent book to anyone who is interested in improving relationships and increasing job performance."
5,text book,as text books go this one isn't too bad. easy to read and follow. would reccomend this book to anyone studying basic councilling
1,Explaining U.S. social classes,"This book was an eye-opener for this non-college grad who holds a very white-collar, upscale position.A must-read for anyone who wants to understand the social strata in today's society. And for anyone whothinks a chasm doesn't exist between those who ""have"" -- and the rest of us.NOTE: This was supposed to be a 5-star rating. I'm new at this....... DUH."
5,So that explains some things!,"After 18 years as a blue collar worker, I went back to school for a career change. After graduating college and coming home from my first day of work in a new office, I was amazed! I couldn't believe that my coworkers had held a brief meeting to decide when to meet to discuss a concern that needed to be addressed! A meeting to decide when to meet seemed so foriegn and bizzare to me. In a blue collar world the concern would have already been dealt with. It's been 7 years since that day and I am constantly surprised at the differences between blue collar and white collar workers. When I read Limbo for the first time I found myself in so many of the pages of his text. The workplace section really resonated but so too did the segments about family and friends. I seem different now to friends and family I suppose and it was extremely helpful to know that I am not alone in this journey to try to fit into a whole new world."
4,A generally pleasing effort,"Barbra was always going to be on a hiding to nothing with this album - a defacto follow-up to the ""Broadway Album"". While it doesn't hit the heights that album did, it has a more consistent feel and sound which is equally pleasing. ""Everybody Says Don't"", ""Children Will Listen"" and ""Speak Low"" are excellent performances of lesser known songs, while the more familiar songs - ""The Music of the Night"", and ""The Man I Love"" - receive Barbra's best. This album is best played right through for full enjoyment as Barbra soars and croons in equal measure."
2,What a wonderul voice barbs has but how about the repertoire,"This is the second cd I have of this series of broadway cds. This cd shows very little improvement from the first cd. I uses a lot of newer tunes and forgets most of the old standards that i'm looking for.Also the instrumentation on this cd leaves a lot to be desired. It uses a lot of electronic instrumentation. I would perfer acoustic instrumentation. One thing about it is Barbar still has a great set of pipes. It is a shame she doesn't want to use them re-glorify the old tunes.I won't buy any more of Barbra's cds, until she makes some changes in her repertoire.Recommendation: I can not recommend this cd."
3,What Happened ???,"It's like Columbia FORCED Barbra to make a follow-up album to THE BROADWAY ALBUM. There is no heart in BACK TO BROADWAY. I love Barbra Streisand, but this album really dissappointed me. Barbra is ageing and her voice is losing it's range, which is fine with me, but she overcompensates on this album. It is oversung. There is no detail. And for a Broadway album, there sure are a lot of ""pop"" arrangements -- most glaringly obvious in ""Luck Be A Lady"". Oh, Barbra.....what were you thinking on that one ?? The ""One Hand, One Heart"" duet with Mr. Mathis is very nice. And the harmony on ""Music of the Night"" is very nice as well.I just don't think the artistry evident in THE BROADWAY ALBUM is present on this one."
3,Not Great,"This in my opinion, is not nearly as good as 'The Broadway Album' and I think it's because of some of the material. The selections 'Some Enchanted Evening' and 'The music Of The Night' the latter with Michael Crawford, are superb but it seems to fall apart after 'Children will listen'. The duet with Johnny Mathis on 'I Have One Love' I found very complex. Their voices blend together well, but it just doesn't cut it. She's in great voice form but the selections are just not familiar enough."
2,Disappointing,"Overproduced and for the most part, oversung! A huge disappointment, especially after the brilliant ""The Broadway Album"". The Andrew Lloyd Webber material is lousy as usual but Streisand also manages to butcher some classic Frank Loesser stuff from ""Guys and Dolls"". Standout tracks are the Sondheim numbers - ""Everybody Says Don't"", ""Move On"", and ""Children Will Listen"". Barbra also manages a decent version of ""Speak Low"". But the rest of the album is pathetic!!"
5,David Scott has done it again!,"Well, Pearlfisher David Scott has done it again, and I mean that in a good way. This EP contains that great Pearlie staple ""Even On A Sunday Afternoon"" as well as a great live version of Jimmy Webb(hit for Glenn Campbell) classic""Witchita Lineman"". The polka /bluegrass version of Anne Murray's tune will bring a smile. Basking Shark is a really cool melodic stream of conciousness featuring a sexy German girl narrating God knows what! More good clean fun from the finest current pop band in the world, the Pearlfishers."
4,Perfect for Kindergarten use,I purchased this to use for my kindergarten class and after watching it I think it will work out great.
4,WAHL Replacement Blade,"It was a much needed upgrade from the dulling blades I was using. Glad to have new blades, cuts like butter"
1,not item pictured,"i had tried to place an order for this item, but the sellers called me and explained that the item pictured is not the item that they had in stock.i asked them if they even had the item in question, they did not. this was ab two weeks ago and the item is still up for sale. i just hope someone reads this and get uppity enough to change the mistake. cause i really wanted this item.._beazorx"
2,"Hmmm, not a fan of her work","I purchased this book because I knew almost nothing about Cecelia Beaux and I couldn't find any books about her at the library or used book store. I am a fan of Berthe Morisot and Mary Cassatt, and I thought I should learn more about Cecelia. They didn't teach much about women artists when I was in school, and I'm trying to fix that.In my opinion I don't think Cecelia's work is top tier. Bassed on the paintings depicted in this book she was just good, not great. So while this book fulfilled my goal of learning more about her, it didn't make me a fan. I'll donate this book to the local library."
3,Where's the beef?,"This book left me hungry for more! Yes, there are some nice reproductions. However, the text is boring and lacking in content. I had the notion that the author simply culled insignificant passages from the artist's personal diary, focusing on interpersonal relationships with family and friends, and a few notable artists of her day. Unfortunately, the story reveals little about Beaux's deeper concerns as an artist.If you're looking for some insight into the artist's particular philosophy of art, or of Beaux's creative issues and processes, and her motivation to paint, sadly, you won't find it here.Given the fact that so little is in print about this great artist, it's probably worth a read ... but borrow it."
3,No other comparable work in English,"The bad news: criticisms expressed in other reviews are quite valid. The good news: this is a fascinating account of an extraordinary 20th-century life, and you won't find anything like it anywhere else in English, or possibly even in Arabic. The author brings to it her sensitivity as a scholar, a woman, and a musician and thus writes a fuller and more convincing account of Asmahan's life than any of her male, Arab biographers have done. If you have been mesmerized by Asmahan's voice, this book is a great way to find out what lay behind it.I think the criticism of the book should mainly be directed at UT press: the book simply wasn't copyedited. How can they expect to retain a reputation as a scholarly press if they don't bother to have someone read, fact-check, and correct the titles they produce? Hopefully the book will survive to a second edition and and the various problems pointed out can be put right."
4,trannslating mistakes,"this book was truly excellent and thorough. however, some of the translations of the lyrics were horrendous and totally destroyed the true meaning of the songs.with a book so well-researched, this is not an acceptable mistake and greatly detracts from its value. otherwise, a great book."
3,Pretty Good but the Formula was Starting to Kick in,"Despite two strong Albums this Album Starts The Fall.while This Disc is Pretty Good it shows The Formula.The Music on this Disc Shows Sade Losing their Touch a Bit here.The best songs were The title Cut,Paradise,I Never Thought I'd See The Day.but This isn't on par with Sade's Best work."
5,Nothing Can Come Between Us..........,"After a three year break, the group came back strong with this recording in 1988 called ""Stronger Than Pride"". If your are old enough to remember, Sade was at their prime, and even though urban radio was starting to focus on the new-jack artist of the day, such as AL B Sure and Guy, Sade found major success with such singles as, Love is Stronger Than Pride, Nothing Can Come Between Us, and Paradise. Over all, this recording was then, and is now, in a class by itself."
3,Experimentation and Growth,"This is a very different album for Sade, but it lays the groundwork for future efforts. On Stronger than Pride, the band distances itself from the smooth jazz of their first releases. The sax is mostly exchanged for the guitar, the rhythms are amplified, and experimentation is emphasized over formula. These changes result in some of Sade's best material, including the ethereal title track, the funky one-two punch of ""Paradise"" and ""Nothing Can Come Between Us,"" and the longing ""Haunt Me."" Then, there are the disappointments. The repetitive, synthesized bass makes tracks like ""Turn My Back On You,"" ""Keep Looking,"" and ""Give it Up"" blend together. Ultimately, Stronger than Pride exhibits an important period of experimentation and growth that never quite jells as an album."
3,Stronger than Pride...,"""Paradise"" is the song of note on this album. Taking nothing away from the other songs, it's just that Sade and her band went in a slightly different direction with this effort. Still, not bad! It's remastered which yields a ""cleaner"" and ""brighter"" sound that one can appreciate! Get your copy and enjoy it!Three stars!!"
4,I slept on this one,"For years I have been saying that ""Promise"" is Sade's best CD, but now I am not so sure. I've owned ""Stronger Than Pride"" for years without ever really listening to it and I can't believe what I missed.This is a very strong CD, and the first five tracks are all standouts. My favorites are ""Haunt Me"" and ""Paradise."" This release is more upbeat overall than its predecessor, ""Promise,"" a very blue work. Of course the signature torch songs are there, but they are nicely balanced with funky cuts. Sade is even optimistic for a change on ""Nothing Can Come Between Us."" Wow!Sade is one of my perennial favorites because of the peerless singer, thoughtful lyrics and first-rate band."
5,This does not suck,"I honestly do not understand what is so bad about this album. It has some really good songs on it. This album is seriously underrated sometimes. Stronger than Pride is a beautiful album, just like the rest of them, I think everyone should try it at least once."
5,Wonderful Sade,I absolutely love this CD and I have many of Sade's CDs but I must say this is my absolute favorite. I play it over and over again.
5,I very highly recomend this book,"I highly recomend this book as well as all her others. Each book captures your attention and you won't stop reading till the very last page. In ""NightWind"" you will find, love, happiness, obsession, magic, and triumph, all of which Lauren finds as well as finding her ancient heritage and magic. And Sentian, a very sexy man and one who finds love across the ages proving that love can be found everywhere. This is a very compelling story that will stay with you, a story that you will not soon forget. For all you dark fantasy fans and romance fans alike, Charlotte Boyett-Compo's books are not to be passed up. She gets better with every book she writes."
4,Laugh-bit by Dittany Henbit,"Charlotte MacLeod, whether writing as Alisa Craig or under her own name, is one of my favorite writers of contemporary cozy mysteries. The characters are lovably whacky, the dialog is witty, and the plot keeps interests focused while the narration entertains you. The zany character names alone keep me turning the page to see who shows up next. Here Miss Dittany Henbit and her fellow Grub-and-Stakers fight against those who would turn their Enchanted Mountain into a subdivision. If you are looking for a bunch of laughs between more weighty tomes, you can't do better than this."
3,readable,"This one is slightly better than the others. I got a number of this series for about $1.99 each. If I hadn't already purchased them, I doubt I would have searched out others after I read the first one. The stories are good--but the dialog (especially the stilted supposedly Edwardian/Victorian sections) are unnecessary and annoying. If you can get past that--a fairly enjoyable read."
2,Hard to get shocked,"Shocking Arm Wrestling - great idea and would be excellent fun, but the hard plastic cuffs seem designed for someone with small fists and wrists and average-sized or large people will find the edges of the cuffs dig into their opponents wrists and the contacts that create the shock don't touch your skin - so no shock. The shock is BIG when you get it...but it's hard to deliver. Would have worked much better if the cuffs were flexible, not hard plastic."
4,Belkin USB,"The Belkin Components 16ft USB Ab Device Gold cable is an excellent, well-built, sturdy high-speed cable, that works well with my Photo Printer, and every other high-speed device that I have. I give it a 9 out of 10 for quality."
1,May be a fine cable - but not for hi-speed scanners,I had high hopes for this cable - straightened it to its full length and hooked it up to a Fujitsu fi-5120c scanner. The time it took to scan a page went from about 5 seconds to over a minute.The product may be good for many applications - but be careful with high speed devices.
5,Great Cable!,I got this to use with my USB turntable for recording LP's. Works great with my turntable and with midi controllers and much more... great cable :)
2,The Practical Pendulum Book,It was an OK book but I would think for beginners it's a bit complicated.I still prefer Dale Olson's book - The Pendulum Charts. He's by far the best I've seen.
1,"Save a Tree, Skip This Book","Practically Useless!!! Yhis has applications for individuals seeking medical resources only. It's pure mumbo-jumbo in my book. I have been using the pendulum with great success since ""The Amazing Kreskin"" pendulum boxed set came out. This book is useless to me, it contains no new/useful information for me."
1,I was disappointed,I expected more and got little. In fact I am so disappointed the book is going back. It isn't worth the used price let alone full price which is what I paid for it. There are exactly 11 pages. Three pages give instruction and the remaining 8 are experiments to try and who's results depend on having and using a copper or gold pendulum. All the remaking pages are charts. Here's one I found paticulary usefull...What things have an unfavorable influence on my health with selections that all have unfavorable influences! Yep! This one is going back.
3,Practical Pendulum Book: With Instructions for Use and 38 Pendulum Charts,"I found the book interesting, but the charts where kind of busy as far as i was concerned, but did like it somewhat"
3,Okay but not Sturdy,"This notebook is as advertised but for the binding, which is a less than sturdy, seemingly flimsy rubber material. If looking for a durable, versatile notebook this is your baby but not sure how seriously this rubbermaid-like binder would be taken at boardroom tables.."
1,Trashy Book On Trashy People,"This only interesting thing about this trite and dated account of the student revolt is that the author takes these self-indulgent kids so seriously. These self-styled ""revolutionaries"" came from comfortable homes and went on to yuppie lives but spent their college years engaged in self-congratulatory political masturbation. They should simply have been expelled at their first violation of the laws, and they are worth a magazine article at best, certainly not a tedious and ideologically shrill book. Grayson Kirk was right."
5,good video light,"good video light that does not use up your video camera battery power as it got it's own battery. light is good eoungh for near by shots. however need to remove the video light when changing batteries for my case. overall, good product."
3,Freddie Krueger 18 inch collectable,"I just got the package today. It was shipped from overseas. Sadly the figure box was pretty beat up and torn. Itwas so beat up I had to take the figure out for display. The figure itself is pretty cool looking. It comes with two different heads and the gloved arm is posable, the figure is very detailed and the sounds is actually not bad. I just wish the box it came in wasn't SO beat up and torn. I am glad the figure itself wasn't damaged. I think the store who shipped it could have done allot better job packing it. I guess when it comes from overseas you have to take a gamble. Overall I give the experience about a 6 OUT OF 10."
2,Not bad,"I was not as impressed with this CD as I wanted to be. The arrangements were not as I remembered, and the sound quality was not great. However, as a reminder of past hits that you want to remember again, it's not bad."
5,Even if Only to Read the Others,"This is the first book in a series. I gave it a five, even though it might have only been worth a three by itself, for the following reason:The series gets much better. If you read this and you like it enough to get the rest as you go along, you will be highly rewarded. The next few are quite good three-star and low four-star novels. Not bad at all. Then you get to _The Road to Evehnor_ and _The Road Home_ These are five-star books. Then you get to read some more very good books. Quite a reward, considering the first few are really worth reading as well, even if not as good.Rosenberg handles the central conceit in this book, gamers being moved to their gaming world, quite well. The characters, especially Walter and Andy, are excellent. The ""game world"" is not generic fantasy fluff."
4,Wireless mouse for my laptop,"Arrived in 2 days, installation was very simple, and I am very happy with the way it works. Much better than the touchpad!"
2,"Clunky, Bulky, Uncomfortable","Mouse is oversized and not suggested for anyone with a hand size smaller than a Men's Medium. The edges are not ergonomically aligned to fit an average hand when seated at a desk. Over the course of a day's work, the mouse's rigid edges rub the user's fingers uncomfortably. Otherwise, it's a mouse. Tracking is average. Clicking resistance is average."
4,Wireless Mouse,This is a replacement for a previous dead mouse. It works better than it's predecessor did when it was alive. It was also priced competitively.
4,"A Near Perfection of Craft, Good or Bad?","Japan for sale traverses the entire spectrum of popular music genres, from rap to rock, electronica to ballad pop, with an unmistakable Japanese flare. The pop is pure sugar with a cherry on top, the rap is fluid and easy on the ears, even the album's grittiest of rock is refined and catchy. The trade off for this fine craftsmanship is the lack of anything cutting edge."
4,Good JPOP CD,"Good Mix of JPOP. READY STEDY GO by L'arc~en~Ceil is a great song, and should be familiar to fans of anime as this is a theme song to Full Metal Alchemist. N.G.S by ASIAN KUNG FU GENERATION is another excellent track."
1,MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT!!,"I bought this CD during a visit to J-town in San Francisco last year and I was shocked at how un-listenable the CD was, I think I only liked two of the tracks. The mix overall is very uneven, I wouldn't consider this as a fair sampling of available jpop, this is an unfortunate rubbish tip packaged for quick sale to the poor soul looking to explore a rich and fun musical vein."
3,Subversive Women,"This collection is an interesting compilation of essays on women around the world. The main focus is to reflect on women's movements and their subversive activities in Africa, Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean. Examples such as the essays on the women's movement in Peru, politics of gender in Brazil and women's participation in social movements in Nicaragua, offer an image of women that increasingly participate in the socio-political life and express their frustration for their lack of representation."
5,Fantastic and Comprehensive,"Great product. Gives a very comprehensive look at the 1960s, and what the decade meant to the history of our country. As a teacher, I feel I can use a lot of what is included to supplement lessons. For those who are history buffs, this is a must, particularly since The History Channel refuses to show any history-based material anymore. Great price, great product."
5,PURE PLEASURE,Give yourself a treat and purchase this DVD.Very well done and the quality of the video is superb. A very balanced presentation.
1,A Tribute? You've got to be kidding.,I have never heard a collection of as much trash in my life. I listened to try to find just one redeeming thing about this album and was unable to. Perhaps I am just too old but I can only think of a bunch of non-musicians sitting around after too much drink and smoke and believing that they are going to make a hit record. I am ashamed of myself for relying on the Kristofferson name and being taken by 3 of the 4 reviews I read.It is no wonder there were no tracks to listen to on Amazon. Never again.
2,Don't do Metal in a bathroom,"I like the look, but it's so hard to keep clean. I would NOT make this purchase again."
5,behave,"Dr. Sal's parenting workshop video is uplifting, practical and humorous. From tots to teens, anyone with children will find this video informative and useful. Learn techniques to diminish misbehavior while increasing positive behavior at the same time. Learn how to discipline your children without lowering their self-esteem. Dr. Sal is a wealth of positive practical parenting know how. You won't be disappointed with Dr. Sal video."
4,A Fun CD,"The war was over, spirits were up, and you can hear it in the songs from that era. The sound is better here than on others in this Hit Parade series. Nat, Bing, and Dinah come through loud and clear. A good choice for your music library."
3,Almost the one to choose,"This unit was a bit tough to start. First unit would start, run and quit in 10 minutes or less. Got tougher to start. Got a second unit. It runs well but also had a tendency to stop in idle, and then it got tougher to start too. The store adjusted the settings for the throttle. It got easier to start. Handled easily, cuts nicely. I am a novice on chainsaws but not on 2 cycle engines. I wish they would make one with an electric starter."
3,You get what you pay for!,For $100 what can you expect? Works pretty well for awhile. Gets the job done. After sitting for a few months - varnish builds up fast and it becomes hard to keep the thing going. Ive had the same problem with both of my low end Poulans. Parts hard to come by unless you pay the authorized dealer to do the work - even changing the air filter! For the money it will get the tree down and save you the cost of paying for removal but for long term use - pay the extra and upgrade some!
1,Hard to start right out of the box,"I have lots of experience with chain saws, although as a home owner with two homes and lots of firewood. I have had maybe six electric and two gas saws, all lower end models. If I used one regularly I suppose that I would splurge for one of the top end models.Anyway I bought one of these poulan models and could not even get it started on a warm day following all instructions. I took it back to the store and got my money back. Worthless."
1,Terrible set. Do not buy!,"I bought this set for my 3 yr old who is going through a ""everything Wizard of Oz"" faze. The previous reviewers are right. There are a million pieces. The threading is coming apart after only a week. The clothes are also too small. My daughter loves the Dorothy dress but its a pain and she complains that the sleeves are not attached, the undershirt un-velcros in the back whenever she bends over and I already had to re sew the straps to the dress because they came apart. One of the Ruby slippers snapped in HALF within the week! She barely touches the Glenda and the witch costume. My recommendation would be to get after market Halloween costumes of the characters which even if they are cheap will be MUCH better quality than this trunk. Interesting idea but very cheaply made and not meant to withstand little girls constant changing and playing. Terrible set."
3,"Adorable, but flimsy.","I bought this as a Christmas present for two little girls, aged two and three, who LOVE The Wizard of Oz. They had plenty of fun with it. They wear these costumes literally every day. The witch costume even helped them overcome their fear of the Wicked Witch! However, the trunk is impossible for me to figure out how to assemble, and is made of cheap cardboard. Not very durable. The costumes, while cute, are equally flimsy. They fray within days and split at the seams and just can't hold up to two eager little girls. It's a wonderful costume set. I wish it lasted longer."
3,Fun factor higher than quality,"I bought this dress-up set for my girls for x-mas. They had a lot of fun with it! I gave this 3 stars because the quality of the items were not as good as I expected. The material was thin (like what you would get from a dollar store) and on the small side. The trunk also has a weak design--two little tabs on the trunk lid fit into two slots on the trunk bottom. However, my girls did enjoy dressing up very much and pretending to be Glinda, the Wicked Witch, and Dorothy."
1,Complete Junk,"This is complete junk. The clothes are more of scraps of material that you piece together than clothes - you can't really tell this in the photo unless you study it. My child is 3 years old and has a small, slender build and the clothes barely fit her. The 'cute' storage truck is some cardborard stock you fold to put together, which doesn't seemed designed to stay together on it's own. Also, there's no photo on the trunk. Buy something else!"
2,Poor quality,"I ended up buying another set of costumes....too many bits to the outfits (frustrating for little ones trying to keep it all together), shoes not the safest for 3yr olds - one of the hats too big the other too small.Pity as the concept is great sadly though quality definitely not worth the $20. My 3yr old is slim and these costumes are too small on her.Lastly the trunk that it comes with does not stay together unless you use a lot of tape.Hope this review helps - if I had someone giving me a heads up about this product I definitely would have thought twice."
3,"Great idea, poor quality",Thank goodness my 3 year old is slim and even then the pieces are small. The pieces are also not well made and for $30 I could buy 2 quality disney or barbie costumes. She loves wizard of oz and thinks this dress-up trunk is very fun. She is frustrated by the way the costumes work with the sleeves being separate.Child is happy but mom is disappointed.
2,Some of the clothes wouldn't fit a 1 yr old,"I was a little disappointed to see the clothes from the dress up trunk. When my daughter took them out on Christmas day and started trying them on, we all broke out in laughter. The shirts that they included in the trunk came up to her upper chest area. I'm not sure who they made these shirts to fit, but they don't fit my very skinny 4 yr old or my 3 yr old son who is shorter in stature then my 4 yr old. Some of the clothes are cute but I would save your money and buy something else."
2,"Cute, but not what I expected","This is a very cute dress up trunk--however, Glenda's witch crown fit me, the bad witch was really little and the shirts to all three outfits was really short--which was a problem for my daughter. She likes her shirts to be long enough to tuck in and these definately weren't even close. If that isn't a problem for your little girl, this would probably be fine--just have to deal with the size difference in the witch hats."
1,"HORRIBLE,HORRIBLE PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!! This is the worst dress up set I have ever seen! I read the reviews and stupidly ordered it anyway figuring, ""How bad can it be?"" Well it is junk. The ""costumes"" wouldn't fit a poodle, let alone a child. Listen to the reviews, do not buy this!!"
1,Total Junk,"I bought this for my 3 and 5 year old girls, who have fallen in love with the Wizard of Oz this year. This trunk and the clothes are a total waste. Cheap, oddly fitted, and did I mention cheap? Each outfit comes in several pieces, so no real dress, just skirts, shirts, sleeves (yes, even the sleeves are separate). Crap material as well. Really, it's a huge waste of money. Better to invest in one solid dress-up piece than this trunk. Garbage."
2,Excitement Deflated,"This is a fantastic dress up idea but just isn't right for the manufacturer's age recommendations of 3-6 years. With the exception of the shoes, this item would be good for 2-3 year olds. I am sorry I didn't heed warnings on how small the clothes are. This was purchased for my 4-year-old. She wears a size 4T-5T in her regular clothes and these dress up items were too small to wear comfortably or decently. The shirts are too short showing her midriff and the elastic in the skirts and sleeves dug into her skin.One of the plastic shoes shattered a couple days after she received them and the cardboard trunk's lid does not stay together well.Like I said, this is a really great idea and it could be a very successful product if the manufacturer will make some improvements."
1,The WORST thing I have EVER Bought,My little girl saw this in a catalog and was so excited for Santa to bring it to her. I would NOT believe the poor quality when I opened it. First there is not really a costume. There just scraps of materia that you put on your arms and then there are skirts. My little girl is 3 years old and small for her age and cannot fit into any of it. The witches hat barely fits my 12 month old and the Glenda crown is a joke. The box is made of cardboard and falls apart - - i wouldn't call it a trunk.This is the ONE present she wanted and does not play with it a day after christmas. Save your Money!!! I have never written a review before but I wanted to warn you - - DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!!! Or you will be sorry.
1,The product is of very poor quality,The material is cheap and there are so many pieces to each costume that the kids will never be able to keep it all together.
2,Not what I expected,"The quality of these dress up clothes was not at all what I expected. The clothes were tiny - too small for my neice for whom I bought the gift. She is three years old, and really petit. All of the shirts were like tankini tops on her. Also, the fabrics were cheap looking and feeling, and the construction of the outfits was disappointing."
2,Not for bigger kids,"The outfits were really flimsy and not for any child older than 3. The skirts are short and the ""trunk"" was hard to put together and fell apart the next day. Not worth the money that we paid for it, but the concept was good. Definetly not a favorite."
1,Waste of money - Way to small for a 3 year old,"The size of the clothing items are RIDICULOUSLY SMALL. I have a 3 year old and she is on the smaller size (2T), the tops only cover half her abdomen, she said Santa must not know her size. The witch hat looks as if it might fit a new born, definitely not a toddler, the diameter is maybe 4 or 5 inches. And the ruby slippers not only are they open toe (closed toe in the movie), but they are huge, makes no sense with the size of the clothes. One of the bows is also turned up and down and we can't turn it to go across the shoe. In retrospect I should have ordered the costumes individually. Other downside, no basket or Toto."
2,Poor quality,We got this very quickly in time for Halloween but the sizes were variable - some were too small for my four year old and others were too big. The material was poor quality but probably a reflection of the price compared with other similar costumes.
1,very dissapointed,"I should have looked at the picture better to see that the sleeves are not even attached to these costumes so of the pieces 6 are sleeves. One hat to big, One to small, the outfits were just of poor quality. The trunk was a put together yourself, I was upset, sent it back. I later found a better quality Tinker Bell dress up trunk with way better clothes also with accesories for $15 at walmart."
5,Very useful and enticing,"The fact that this book's intention is to have an relaxation and at the same time it gives suggestions to strengthen relationships, it becomes a great book. The illustrations/images are there, the way the author wrote gives ample amount of information and easy to understand for the instructions. It is a fine read, I would use this along with the book I readAdult Games: Sexy New Ways To Relive The Old Flames In Bed, and will try to spice up things in bed with my girl."
4,"Okay, but kind of one sided","This is a great book if you're a man and want to give your significant other a great massage, but it's clear that a man has done all the photography. My husband and I had to laugh when we noticed that all the women are pictured full frontal while all the guys are shot from the back! I have since found that most massage books follow that same philosophy. It's interesting that, given the century and the subject material, a photographed (...) still seems to be taboo. I finally had to order a book aimed at gays in order to get actual pictures and how-tos on giving my partner a sensual massage."
5,Wonderful book by the massage master,"Lush photos and lovely, understated text. A masterpiece. Own this book, better yet--use it. The massage is wonderful"
1,loved it,i used to love it when it was a displey piece but when i opened it the leg was already was broken and it looked like it had been used
5,Excellent Stories,"Though I am still reading the book, I had to write this review as I enjoyed it very much - so much so that I did not go for my daily evening stroll. This book may be considered a compilation of stories by Jewish Germans waiting to emigrate from their( no longer) Nazi fatherland. Coming from a developing country the stories seems so modern. Germany seems to be such an advanced country but with a soul of a devil. I don't think things have improved much, I do remember having a bad time when I visited Germany in 1979 as a child ( not that the situation was good in Moscow, where I was based, or in UK). Xenophobia also exists in India and we must try to rise above such petty matters though sometimes it make life more interesting ( if you are not the victim). Well enjoy this book in your cosy bedroom and shed few crocodile tears for those long dead persons!"
1,This product does NOT work on the VX 8100,I ordered this for my VX8100 and it does not work on that product as promised.
5,This is the best smelling dryer sheet I have ever known.,I probably shouldn't have gotten so emotionally involved with this dryer sheet because I ended up getting hurt when it disappeared. I just wish they would make it again!
2,Wooden Characters and Clumsy Writing,"I would have given this book one star but the premise of the story was interesting enough to rate the second star despite the very poor writing. This novel was a reminder for me not to purchase a book just because it has a gay theme and is written by a gay author. The characterization was so wooden that it was almost humorous. The reviews I read must have been written by the author's friends or someone who has a lot of copies in inventory. I normally wouldn't dream of doing this, but I actually threw the thing in the trash after forcing myself to finish it. I don't mean to be nasty, but I felt a little betrayed by the reviews. It's hard to imagine very many readers giving this 4 stars."
3,"Entertaining, but requires much suspension of incredulity","Unlike other amazon reviewers, I liked the last part of the book (more than ""the ending"") the best. I have had some of the fantasies that propel the action of the book. The convergence of the three ""Wise Men"" stretches disblief, but what gave me the most difficulty was believing that the FBI would send someone undercover with as little ""basic training"" (like, say vocabulary drill) or backgrounding as Raider has, and that anyone could cover up such ignorance.Some of the characters (Freedom, Deon) were developed; others (Jasper, Bruce, and the way-too-unsuspicious Othello) were insufficiently developed (with Raider somewhere in between). The book was sufficiently interesting to keep me reading."
4,This book made me think!,"I'm a pacifist and Uprising made me very uncomfortable, but in a good way. It made me think about my views and was extremily entertaining. I'm not sure I've ever read anything like it. It's great to finally see black gay characters like Othello, the pop singer, in the lead role. The sexual tension between him and Raider, the straight white FBI agent was HOT!"
4,Not perfect but pretty good for the money,"I own three of these stands. Two of them have followed me around Europe for the past three years and I've yet to have a single problem with them. I don't use them daily but often enough. They are a little flimsy when fully extended and the weight of a large softbox or a studio light with a beauty dish will cause a slight deflection but if the stand is oriented correctly and weighted, it holds up just fine. A bus knocked one down during a freezing late-night shoot in Switzerland and it still functions.Granted these are not top-of-the-line studio stands but then they only cost $24. They're are cheap enough that I consider them disposable even though I've yet to break one. When you figure that pro-grade stands cost almost $600 each, you'd have to go through a LOT of these little guys before you got anywhere near that number."
4,Westcptt 750 Photo Basics 7.5 Light Stand,Westcott 750 Photo Basics 7.5-Foot Light StandThis is a very reasonably priced light stand that is working very well for me in my small studio. It's fairly compact and light weight which makes it easy to manuever. I've never used it outside but it would have to be weighted in any windy situation. I'm very statisfied with this economical light stand.
2,Does not come complete,"I ordered this and ended up returning it the same day. I was interested in the sun reflectors and bought the tripod as a package. It does not come with the neccesary attachment for the reflectors I bought. Your under the impression the deal was ""complete"", yet it is not. I was terribly disappointed. The piece they recommend will not work either."
4,Advanced Amateur lighting user,"This lightstand was touted as being a worthwhile purchase alongside a Photek 60 inch umbrella. If the truth were to be told, this particular stand is a little short and is not heft enough with respect to its construction.Alll of that having been said, it is nice and light and the price as very reasonable. The product was delivered promptly, as is Amazon's wont.I'm happy"
3,"Okay for the price, but not as main light stand","This lightstand is made in China and feels very cheap, although the price is also cheap. I would not recommend this stand as your main light stand however as a backup or secondary stand, it's fine.For the main light stand, look to something sturdier (and as a bonus, made in Italy);Avenger A630B Mini Max Kit Stand (Black). It will last you longer, and is not as flimsy and generally looks and feels more professional."
2,Failing umbrella mount,"I have owned this product since 2009 for use with my canon speedlights and I have begun to notice a number of the threaded screws that keep certain parts of the stand tight, simply do not work anymore. This is especially evident in the umbrella mount, I'm guessing the thread is ""shot"" internally (its plastic). Additionally, when folding or unfolding the stand, the springs now seem to stick and are tough to open.When everything worked properly (brand new), the stand was exceptional. However, it did not take many uses to discover faults in the construction.This stand is very lightweight and I only use it indoors standing very close to my speedlight should it happen to fall over. Luckily I have never had this stand tip over on me.Overall, I'm disappointed, but the stand is very affordable."
3,used and damaged,"i ordered this last week, in hopes to use it to take easter pics! well it was delivered today but i was very dissapointed with what i got. what they sent me was a clearly a used stand. it had several scuffs and scratches all over it. the sticker is half ripped off & someone scribbled out writing with a black permanent marker!!!! did they think i wasnt going to notice??! this is unacceptable!!!!!!!! one less stand to use to take easter photos, thanks alot!! i will never order from this site again."
3,Meant for light-weight applications,"This light stand is inexpensive, so it is expected to not have the build quality of stands that are many times more expensive. However, please keep use to light-weight applications, such as a flash with 36"" umbrella or a fluorescent softbox. If you anticipate heavier equipment that makes the stand top heavy, I recommend weighting it down with a sandbag to give it greater stability. Of course, that's good advice for any light stand. Others have complained about the spring mechanism breaking, but I have not had mine long enough for this to be a problem."
4,Solid stand - not so compact,"This is a solid, medium weight stand. It does what it's supposed to do and is better for lights/flashes/etc that are on the medium weight side(or if you have softboxes). Frankly, I prefer my Manfrotto 001B, which is a super-light-weight 6 foot stand, and folds down much smaller. So in the end... as a studio stand, great. As a portable stand, not bad, but you can buy lighter. Build quality is fine and none of the hardware seems cheap. A previous review said this stand was ""air cushioned"" but it really isn't. It might have that effect in the right conditions but I own some true ""air cushioned"" stands and this one is not. For the price, you won't complain."
2,Light Stand,"I got what I paid for, not a sturdy stand at all. I would not recommend this stand to any serious photographers.Vthomas"
1,Worthless,"I have four. One has a plastic piece that snapped and it doesn't stay up. Two won't erect all the way and the other one gets stuck and you have to force it up.I noticed that these are labeled ""Educational Photo & Video Lighting Kits"" in the Westcott, so that would probably be Westcott's excuse for the crappy quality. But since I now have three broken stands and need to upgrade, I'm reluctant to buy from a company that is willing to sell such low quality equipment.By the way, I use these stands about once a week indoors."
4,OK for the price,"This light stand is pretty good for the price. It has a good maximum height (remember that if you're attaching an umbrella, you will need an additional 1-2 feet of vertical space), but doesn't collapse too small (it is about 2x the length of my tripod with the umbrella adapter attached). It is lightweight, but not very stable at max height with an umbrella and canon 430ex attached. It is made of cheap material, and the spring inside does not sound like it will last very long...it makes metal-on-metal sounds sometimes.However, it does what it's supposed to do, and at a low price. I would recommend it as part of a beginner's first lighting kit."
5,"Sturdy, Light Stand for Cheap","I am impressed by this sturdy little sucker. It hold my strobe and umbrella very easily. I love the air cushion that it has. It doesn't pinch or slam down when you lower it, and pops up when you unscrew it to move it up. The only thing that was difficult was opening the feet for the first time. Works great so far."
4,Good for indoor shoot,Item is good for indoor shoot but not good for out door shoot as it is light weight.Worth the money.
4,Barely does the job,"These light stands barely do the job of holding up 24"" photoflood softboxes, and they do look pretty professional from a distance. But they are so lightweight and flexy that I would never trust anything that weighed more than a few pounds at full extension. I ordered some new Manfrotto 1004BAC $85 light stands to replace this, as I feel like I'm young enough to get a full lifetime out of them, so why waste life with cheap gear."
2,Only for very light flash unit.,"Good?1. Very LightBad?1. I guess it is made with very thin pipe, so that when I extend legs and tighten the knob, somehow it pushes the bottom piece ( pipe ) inside so that it blocks other pieces to come out. ( I didn't twist it too hard). I have to loose it to pull others out.2. I can hear the sound of springs inside. ( make it looks cheap :) )3. Each piece is not holding tight each other. I only use 2/3 length of each piece and leave 1/3 to overlap. otherwise it will be wabblilng.I am not going to buy this for this price. if it was $15, it will be ok, but for $25, find another one."
3,Good for my uses,"I bought this light stand Strictly for Holding a small solid backdrop for my Commercial Head Shots. I knew it was very lightweight, and had no intention of using it to hold my heavier light set ups.If you're looking for something to hold Hot-Shoes flashes and an umbrella, this is the one for you.If you need it to hold Studio Mono-lights, I'd suggest something a little sturdier.Other than that, it does what I need it to...very light duty!!"
3,Nice inexpenisive back up stand,"Nice product in general. I went with 3 stars because for me the product works very well. Please keep in mind that I use these stands with small lights/softboxes. I would not recommend using these stands with large heavy lights/modifiers - Your Mileage May Vary. For the money this is a decent product. Having said that, I'm pretty sure it would not hold up under the strain of extensive daily use as it is somewhat cheaply made. I have two of these stands and I use them about 3-4 times a month for my artistic photography and for basic head-shots. I use these stands exclusively with Photoflex Litedome XS softboxes and wireless Nikon SB-900's hotshoe strobes. This setup is extremely portable, lightweight and has a very small footprint. I can grab the whole setup with one hand and place it most anywhere."
4,Decent Product For The Money,"For the money this is a decent product. Having said that, I'm pretty sure it would not hold up under the strain of extensive daily use as it is somewhat cheaply made. I have two of these stands and I use them about 4-5 times a month for my artistic photography and for basic head-shots. I use these stands exclusively with Photoflex Litedome XS softboxes and wireless Nikon SB-900's hotshoe strobes. This setup is extremely portable, lightweight and has a very small footprint. I can grab the whole setup with one hand and place it most anywhere. I went with 4 stars because for me the product works very well. Please keep in mind that I use these stands with small lights/softboxes. I would not recommend using these stands with large heavy lights/modifiers - Your Mileage May Vary."
2,Don't buy it if you see yourself using it longer than a year,"Bought this and used it maybe half a dozen times lightly but now the tops section can't be tighten anymore. What can I say, it is light weight, but also very light duty and is not durable at all. For a serious photographer, it is a waste of money. no matter how cheap it is."
5,Great Value!,"I bought this as part of the reflector kit, but I also use it by itself as a light stand and it feels very solid and well built, however I do recommend using sandbags with it if you are extending it over 6'."
1,It will break faster than you think.,One of the springs broke just after couple of uses but stand was still usable with a bit of force necessary to extend it.Then after about 20 more uses one of the screws stopped working and I could not keep the last part of the stand extended.Who knew such simple thing as stand can be so screwed up.Do not buy!
3,Flimsey but it works,The material for this product is very flimsey and cheap. Don't buy this if you are using it for something heavy because it is not designed for heavy things. Overall it's ok though. You get what you pay for!
5,Lisa Rayes got the butt all the way!,"Lisa Raye is extremely hot.Fine body,nice round boobs, and delicious looking butt!"
3,What to get the fan who has it all,"You need ""Disco in Mosco"" (the original version is included here, not the re-recording that appeared on a greatest hits CD) to complete your Vibrators collection. As for the rest, well, it's not their best stuff but it's not bad."
1,I expected better quality,"Appendix F, Sample Bylaws flawed. Section 3.11 states ""Directors have no voting power""; which is contradicted by section 10.04 which states that a ""majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors""....Many more flaws - if you use the book be vigilant of misinformation."
2,not for younger babies,I have an 11 month old. She is standing and pulling up on everything but not walking on her own yet. This walker goes extremely fast and if she uses it as a walker; I have to walk with her and hold the back to slow it down so she doesn't fall forward. It really was not what I was looking for in terms of helping her gain more walking mobility. She can however use it as a riding toy.
1,There are better options than this toy!,"We received this as a gift for our 1 year old daughter. When we got it home, it didn't even work! We changed the batteries and put it together right too! None of the functions worked, so we took it back to Toys r us and returned it for another one. The same issue occured with this one. So we had to return it again. The store said that this toy has allot of problems and they're getting allot of returns on this item. So save some time and money and get something different!"
2,"a lots of fun with music and sorting... but , not as good as walker...","My 11 months old son enjoys sorting and honking with fun music... but, he can not use it as walker yet. He is currently crusing stage, he loves to push and walk with the carton box came with this toy, but, this toy does not have any speed resistant feature, so, he can not hold on to the bar.... when he tried as walker. It gets so much faster than he can hold on to it... I wish it features some kind of speed resistant features."
4,Wonderful toy!!,"My 11 month old daughter received this toy for Christmas. She LOVES it!! She loves to sit down next to it... turn on the ""radio"", and dance. She loves sitting on it and pushing her legs to go... and she loves using the walker part.This is such a great toy!! I recommend it to everyone!"
2,Not the best walker,"I received this as a gift for my daughter when she was nine months old. I had a different one like the Little Tykes, with my son. Compared to the Little Tykes this is useless. We have hard wood floors and this goes too fast for her. She is an adventurous girl but even she doesn't like the ""feel"" of it going so fast. With the Little Tykes my son was walking by 11 months on his own. My daughter, I think due to the lack of practice with the laugh and learn, is 12 months and still just cruising. If you have hard wood I would not purchuse this walker. Also, the way my daughter has to walk between the ""legs"" of the toy is uncomfortable for her. I know this one is expensive and many of you probably think the more expensive the better. This is not the case with this walker."
5,The highlight of playdates...,"All the kids just love this ride-on. From ages 1-4 it seems to be a hit. I have never used it for under 1 year, so I can't review that aspect. But my son is 2 1/2 now and just loves riding it and playing the different sounds/music. It doesn't get old with him! It has been very sturdy for us, he even uses it outside on the sidewalk. The shape sorter area (under the hood) is used to store sippy cups and other things he finds, that is a fun feature."
5,Very Cute!,"My daughter just turned 9 months old and loves ride on cars. We have 2 other popular push n ride cars, several push walker toys but when I saw this at the store I couldnt pass it up. It was an excellent choice! She loves to push this one and ride on it. It seems to be easier for her to push because of the way the car opens up it keeps her legs from stepping to far outside. Anyway she loves the steering wheel and sounds! Well worth the money!"
4,Gift for our Grand Daughtert,The item arrived well within time for Christmas. Some slight damage to the box but no damage to the item. Our Grand Daughter loved it.
2,Doesn't teach upright walking,"My 11 month old loves this toy so much he screams when we take it away, but it has one big downside: the baby can grab on to the bottom of the toy to push (instead of the yellow handlebar), which is all my boy wants to do. We're keeping it to use later as a ride on toy as it's very cute. Once the toy is assembled it can't be unassembled (the wheels lock in from the inside), so we couldn't return it if we wanted to."
4,Reid Loves This Toy,"My son, Reid (10 months), really loves this toy. He loves the steering wheel, and the hood that opens and closes. I will say that the wheels turn very easily, so it's easy for him to fall when he tries to pull up. It would be better if it had brakes on it."
4,review,good design a little bit too large for a young childneed a sound on/off hidden button for parents
5,Most Versatile,"The Laugh & Learn Stride to Ride Walker is the most versatile walker/rider in it's category, that I have found on the market. After seeing it, nothing else compares in my mind. We bought this walker/rider for our Grand Daughter as well as for our nephew, and both absolutely love it. It is a fantastic purchase for the price. I would highly recommend this. The Stride to Ride Laugh & Learn is very entertaining as well as educational, just as the product claims. I am so glad that we found & purchased this. It was money well spent and I know the kids will get plenty of use out of it!"
3,Add-ons prohibitively expensive,Not only are these GPS unit expensive but adding a data card and additional software is really expensive. A person is able to buy a pretty slick computer for what these units and software total.
4,good spectative,"I haven't use this product yet, but it seens to be helpfull for point the fix i need at sea. I'll coment again, when a first use this."
3,I think the older model (176C) was better for me,I'm a Amazon River Pilot and I use GPS only for marine navigation. The GPSMAP 276C is a good equipment but in my opinion has too many features that most people do not use. Before I had a 176C that was much more easy and quick to use for marine navigation: it was made for that. The only advantage I see in the 276 is it's better screen resolution. I only got the 276C because my 176C had a problem in the screen and I could not get a new one as it had been descontinued. Also Garmin charts are very bad for the Brazilian coast: I do not understand why they use charts from so many countries that do not have good information about the Brazilian coast ( russian charts for exemple ).
5,Outstanding Garmin product...as usual,"Garmin has to be the best GPS available. It is the only one I buy, and this is my fifth unit. It is fast to aquire satellite data, and will position you within feet of where you are. I would like to have the option to increase the size of the font, but that is not available to the extent I need for motorcycle use. Rugged and reliable, if just a little over price; but then you are paying for the Garmin name. Software was easy to install on my GPS."
3,In for repair,"Nice unit, does everything well. After third use, the voice disappeared, unit back to Garmin for replacement. Second week and waiting."
1,COuldn't understand it,I guess I'm too young for this one.. so many references to events in the 60's and the use of 60's British slang that I gave up.
2,Hey Pup! Fetch it Up!,Tarrant has a strange writing style and an even more odd philosophy on dog training. I would not recommend this book as my only resource for training a new puppy; only as alternate reading when books by Spencer and Wolters have been read.
5,Good Non-Force training method,"Bill's technique of no force shed a new light to my ideas on how dogs should be trained. I was on my way to training my newest retriever just liked I'd trained many dogs before. Bill's book shed a new light on things. I tried it and it works! I recommend to anyone, give it a try before you knock his technique!"
2,Very touchy feely approach to training.,"I am an amateur at dog training. This book has a lot of personal stories that vaguely relate to training. Terrant has the same approach to training that a person would use with a child that misbehaves, ""If you don't do as I say, I'm going to give you a time out!"". This didn't work for my dog and set back her training. I recently purchased ""Water Dog"" by Wolters. This book is more to the point, half the reading, and works."
2,Not good for the beginner,"Even though this book contains a lot of things,but you can not konw exactly how to do them from the book.The whole book is something like introduction and result.If you are interested at random number algorithm, this book is OK.The best book of Monte Carlo Methods for the beginner is Basics, Volume 1, Monte Carlo Methods,though this book is quite expensive."
5,Just What I Ordered!!!,My purchase came very quickly and in perfect condition. Thanks so much:) I will definitely order from you guys again!
2,"A good lid, BUT....","Their lids have a plastic handle. And they melt, totally, if (foolishly) used in the microwave. And the whole thing then comes apart. Now I have to hope to find a replacement part. They are not constructed securely to begin with....."
3,"it was good, but...","It was touching in ways but as a teenager right now, (I'm 16) it was a little hard to relate to."
3,Amanda's Review of Chicken Soup for the Teen's Soul on Love & Friendship,"I like the Chicken Soup for the Soul books, and I liked this one in particular because it was written for teens. It was, I believe, the first one I read for teens, and I enjoyed reading very much what other teens had to say. On the other hand, though, many of the stories are similar, so after I had read a few, they got a little bit reptitious. Overall, though, it was a good book."
3,Love & Friendship - not quite as good as rest of the series,"The Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul series is a wonderful series written by teens for teens and this book is a spin-off, if you like, of that very successful, popular series.However, I found the stories and range of topics to be not quite as good as those found in the other teenage Chicken Soup books. The Friendship section had some beautiful stories in it as is to be expected from this series but I found some of the stores in other sections such as Growing Up to be cliched and boring. While I found it hard to put the other books down, this one was quite easy to put away.If you are looking for a really good Chicken Soup book I would recommend Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul II or even the first or third books rather than this one. Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul - Love & Friendship lacks the same edge and originality as the other books."
5,Best yet,"After reading Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul on Love and Friendship I realized how terrible things can be. It also shows you how to make the best of things that you think are the worst. I never thought that Chicken Soup books were for me until I read this one.You can make life into whatever you want it to be. You shouldnt let guys or friends step in your way. This Cihcken Soup teaches you about all the problems and situations you come across with guys and friends. If either your firend or your boyfriend tried to step in your way of accomplishing something they dont really care because friends and boyfriends dont do that. So if your interested in love, relationships, and friendships then this is the book for you."
5,Chicken Soup is the best!,"This book was awesome. I love reading stories written by teens, especially true stories. I would definately recommend this book to anyone who loves to read and is just looking for a good book, or even someone who dislikes reading and just wants to read the romance stories. From romance to helping people, CHICKEN SOUP FOR THE TEENAGE SOUL ON LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP IS THE BEST!"
3,Good overview for tourists,"This is kind of a novice's attempt to capture the best of New York City. Having lived here all my life (nearly 4 decades) I can say with all honesty that this is just ""okay"" for tourists, and doesn't come near to capturing the essence of this great city. If I were considering a first time trip to New York, this video would not make me book my trip. Has some good coverage of famous places, but views more like a long commercial than a video. Save your money and just rent it from the library for free."
1,sizing is misleading,I ordered 2 jackets for my daughter and her friend for Halloween in an adult size extra small (3-5). The jackets arrived today and they are so tiny there is no way a women who is a size zero could wear it. It looks like the jackets were sized for toddlers.
3,pink jacket,"This item arrived as stated, but it seems to run small. We had ordered it as part of a Halloween costume for my daughter, and the sleeves weren't long enough. Consider ordering a size up."
5,Great pot/dutch oven,"We purchased this pot as a replacement for one we had previously owned. It's exactly what we wanted and came quickly. We didn't receive notice of when it was coming, but it was delivered promptly."
2,Skip This Product,I purchased these headphones for use in the office. The integrity of the headphones is fine and the setup was fairly easy. I was excited to try them out. The sound quality of the headphones is terrible even with them 3 ft from the sensor I still get static. I tried a number of distances but even as far as the edge of my cube they are breaking up really bad. This product will be returned to Amazon.
5,Amazing!,"This is by far one of the greatest tv shows ever made. If you haven't seen it yet, watch it!"
5,Prison break,"I bought this for my husband and he loved it, too bad it only watched the whole thing once. It came quick, at a great price, and in great condition. A very good buy if you like this show."
5,Really Good,The box was in great condition and the discs were not scratched one bit. I kind of wish that they would have kept the picture that was attached to the dvd box when bought but other than that it was good!
5,PHENOMINAL!!!!,Prison Break is by far the best TV Series I have ever seen in my life. It is beyond what you think could ever happen. Eric & Rachael give it 2 thumbs up!
5,good product,I wanted to buy the complete series so I can watch it at my own pace.It is so good. I am happy with it.
3,"Not Very Realistic, but Fun!","Of course, this season got a little hokey, and wasn't really that believable, but overall it was still a blast to watch. The plots and breaking out of jail and whatnot were a bit repetitive from the first and second seasons, but they did it well and made it interesting to watch. Some of the character development was also really good, but then others seemed to be out of character for the majority of the season. Also, I can't believe that for 13 episodes the price of this season was so much more expensive than all the others! I waited until it finally came down to a reasonable amount ($20) and even that, I feel, was too much. It should have been about $15."
3,Good,"Season 3 is kinda slow and even boring at some points. Season 2 is the best in my opinion. If you want to have the whole collection, like I do, I guess it's worth the price."
2,This one's pretty bad,"This is just a remake of season one with an artifical, badly written and unbelievable plot. There's just so many parts where it's hard to believe the characters' actions. Seems like eveyone but the brothers changes sides from one eposide to another - just to keep the ariticle suspense going.But it's still worth getting if you saw the previous 2 seasons, but very hard to watch, almost painful."
4,"So Far, So Good",Arrived by arrival date in good condition. I've only gotten through disc one of three; disc one played perfectly. Four stars until I finish the season; if all discs play well; will be a 5-star review.
5,Excellent show!,My kids and I love this show. Some may even call it an addiction lol. Definitely a great series :)
3,"Gets more unbelievable, but I still enjoy it.","Prison Break seems to get more and more unbelievable with each season. This season (Season 3) requires a fairly high suspension of disbelief. The episodes are entertaining enough, but I think I made the right decision to watch them during the summer down season when there weren't better shows on to be watching."
4,Prison Break Season 3,This is one of my least favorite seasons... still really dope! Nothing can top season 1.
5,Strike made this the best season by far,"Prison Break Season 3 is the best season by far. Before watching it, I was influenced by the fact that it was strike-shortened, and I thought it might be incomplete and would not be very good. Instead, it turns out to be one of the best laid-out TV Series I have ever watched, along with the best of them all - 24 Season Five. While PB Seasons 1 and 2 occasionally dragged as if they had to fill out 22 episodes within a constrained theme, in a strange way, the strike might actually have helped Season 3. Everything became pacier, plot twists coming quicker, and the pressure getting relentless. I watched the last ten of the 13 episodes in one go, and it was exhilarating stuff. Whereas I would give Seasons 1 and 2 about three stars, this one is an unqualified fiver."
4,The strike affected all Prison Break fans...but.,"At first I kinda felt the 3rd season of Prison Break started off a little stale. Then by the third episode I was hooked as usual. You got Scofield dumped in the most horrific prison known to man. You got Bellick walking around half-naked lookin' like something the cat dragged in, after it threw it up. Mahone is going through some serious withdrawal issues. And Linc on the outside pretty much clueless. My boy Sucre is still hangin' around dedicated to Michael for all he's done. T-Bag continues his menacing wrath. Newcomers, Whistler and Lechero and the vicious Gretchen a.k.a Susan B. make for some very interesting storylines. I agree that that daggone writer's strike did make this season seems rushed. It's all worth it though to see Wentworth Miller all hot and sweaty between a rock and a hard place."
3,Weak season,Overall Prison Break was a very good show. Show title could have been better. This season they are put in a prison in another country and have to break someone out. Not a good season at all. Prison was boring and a lot of the new players were boring. Putting them back in prison was not a good idea. Had a shocking moment and some good points but not a great season weakest of the 4. Buy only if you like the show.
1,Disappointed Irish customer,Unfortunately We cannot play this as it has the wrong region code for our DVD player. Wish Amazon would warn Irish customers that the product may not be suitable when buying from America. Very disappointed.!!
5,good for non gluten diet,"My wife and daughter has celiac disease and it it perfect with a bannana, cinnamon,and stevia. This provides them a very healthy and delicious desert."
4,Pretty good!,"It's been a while since I bought this, but I remember it being quite good. It's not so tasty, but it does the job. If you eat it quickly it will still be somewhat crunchy, but be advised that the crunchiness is just a little over that of Rice Krispies. Otherwise you can let it sit for a while and become more of a mushy texture.I found out that even rice has a gluten-like protein and I have since given it up. But if you're not sensitive to gluten and similar proteins, this may work for you."
4,Crunchy Rice Cereal,"I like this cereal. It isn't sweet, and it's crunchy. I like how it is packaged in a small box, instead of some of the cereals I have seen that are packaged in much larger boxes when they only contain as much cereal as this one. Overall I would give this cereal four stars for taste and texture. Very good!"
5,Great addition to our cereal cabinet!,"We are a gluten free household of 5 and everyone loves sprinkling this cereal in with others for some added crunch. They are cute, crunchy, and the flavor is not too mild nor too strong. I dare not run out of this one or we may have a mutiny in our cereal loving family!"
4,"Nice, but did they need to kill an entire tree to ship it?","I ordered two 3-packs of these and am happy with the items. They are nice bamboo hoops as advertised. But the packaging was ridiculous. Each 3-pack came in a separate HUGE box with lots of packing paper. If you are thinking you'll be a little environmentally conscious by selecting bamboo, forget it."
5,My opinion of this item,"This is a good product, but the image is not the same when you recieved the product. The product is better than the image in the Amazon.comI recomended this item to all customers.ShoeMall which is the store where I bought my Florsheim shoes is the best.Thanks."
4,Exactly what it says,"An excellent introduction to the most important parts of opening theory with some ideas to give you a fun, open game. It has some rewarding tricks and traps, but is mostly designed to show you step by step how to make the most from the opening without mindless memorization.The section on closed games is very thin, but since most elementary games do not feature Queens Gambit or English Opening, this is little to fear.Most importantly, in his usual style, Schiller spends his time explaining the WHY of the moves, not just lists of analysis.I heartily recommend this volume as a way to get an opening repertoire for elementary or beginning players.Later, you will need to add other books to round out your game, especially for Queen's pawn openings. (For this I likeComplete Defense To Queen Pawn Openings (Cardoza Publishing's Essential Opening Repertoire Series).)First Openings will give you enough opening knowledge to prevent frustration long enough to focus on tactics and endgame."
2,There better with Becky Bondage,"This is a pretty good album, but there much better with there origanal singer songwriter Becky Bondage. If you want to here the real voice of a generation pick up something with Last Rockers, Stand Tall Stand Proud, or Latex Love on it, Thats the true VICE SQUAD!"
3,Cute soft toy but a bit pricey for what it is,"It's a nice soft toy for younger kids. Each of the blocks has something different such as a ring or a ""mirror"" along with different animals. However our do not stack as shown in the picture. They are soft which is a good thing but it also means that it can be crushed pretty easily which is not a problem until the corners get bent in. When that happens, the cubes do not return to their original shape by themselves but rather must be pulled back into shape which generally works but must be done by a parent."
4,babies love taggies,My 9 month old loves tags and strings that stick out from anything. So I thought these taggies blocks would be great for him. The blocks are colorful and each block has different tags and strings and crinkles and jingles. Absolutely adorable! You can hang them in your stroller to keep them busy.
5,Taggies Soft Blocks,"We love the Taggies toys. These blocks were for my 8-month old granddaughter but her 2 1/2 yr old brother loves them too. The blocks are soft with lots of stuff to pull and chew on. The blocks all make different sounds when squeezed and have fun things to look at, feel and play with."
4,awesome cloth blocks,"These blocks are perfect for us! They are cloth and machine washable (hold up pretty good) and my son loves them. He chews on the tags and likes the various noises they make. A bit pricey, but great blocks that I hope will continue to be entertaining for a very long time."
5,nice,"We got them a week ago and they are cool. My girl is 6 months and likes them. They have many thinks to grab them by and are colorful.First I was a little skeptic because of the price but you end up having 4 separate toys that stay around in different places at $6 each, not bad:) They are great to attach to stroller or playmat or crib, they come with two chain linksthey are HUGE - almost 4 inchesthey are machine washable and you can humble them dry. Only the mirror got a ""scratch"" already, maybe I bent it to much :(and of course the satin white product label is the most interesting one"
2,My daughter is not interested; pricey,I am disappointed in this item. The blocks aren't very big and don't retain their shape when handled. One of them I still can't fix. My daughter isn't very interested in them at all (she is almost 11 months now and has never liked them). I would not recommend this product.
2,Disappointed,"I would not buy these soft blocks again. I love Taggies products, but was very disappointed with these blocks. I like to thoroughly clean the toys I purchase before my son plays with them. I tossed these in a pillowcase and threw them in the wash machine. After that they totally lost their shape and then a couple days later they began to smell musty. If you do buys these, do not wash them."
5,Taggies Big Soft Blocks,"Bought these for my new granddaughter who was 2 months old when I gave these to her. My daughter uses them for her tummy time. They are soft and safe. Each on has a unique quality, for example: one has a rattle noise when you shake it, one makes a crinkle noise when squeezed. They also have loops so you can attached these to strollers, car seats...etc. Very smart toy. Very educational. My granddaughter loves them. Each one is unique and brightly colored. they also come in a handy carrying case. I highly recommend these. Thank you."
4,"they pass time, fun, but...","my only thing I can hate on here is that they kind of crush in and you cant get it out, so when she oressed it in, it has stayed that way. Now that was on one of them, the one with the crinkle paper in it, the rattle and bell ones are great, but I can see it happening soon. Good product for a great deal, and amazon has the best price, as I shopped around. Make sure you wash them, not to much of an odor, but anything from china you just want to mke sure you clean them, because they go right to the mouth for the initial taste test to grade how much fun they will be for her!!great buy, great toy, amazon wins big on price (due to shipping)"
3,Overall would not recommend,"Not as good I was hoping for...The tags are a bit too difficult to get to and the blocks itself crumble easily when my sons tries to plays with them. Unless I am actively playing with my son, these really do not hold his attention (I was hoping they wood). They also do not stack up nicely, keep falling down, so I am not sure if you can even call them ""stacking blocks"". Taggies is overall a great company with a lot of other toys I own, but with this one I was a bit disappointed..."
2,Disappointed... Taggies Big Soft Blocks are just OK...,"I bought these Taggies soft blocks thinking that they were going to be ""soft"" blocks that would at least hold the shape of a ""block"". They do not hold there shape AT ALL! They squish down into whatever shape... and then never ""Pop"" back (even if you try to re-shape them). I would not recommend these blocks. We bought them for our son because he loves this one ""Sassy"" foam block that he has. These blocks did not even entice him. He does play with them ocassionally because they have fun things sewn onto them, but he is mostly not interested..."
3,Good quality blocks (well stiched) but way too expensive for foam blocks. Find them on sale if you can.,Got these for my 6 m/o nephew and honestly they are well built. On the other hand I think you should either get more than 4 blocks for $25+ or they need to lower the prices. If price is not an issue then I say go ahead and get them.
4,waited too long,"Our child was fascinated with tags, so we bought this and thought we'd hold onto it for a month for her birthday. Too late, she stopped being so interested in tags. This toy is great, though, just what she would have liked a month or so before we gave it to her. It's colorful and sturdy and well made. We'll pass it on to someone with a younger child."
2,Where are the demos?,"First of all, the track listing is wrong from what appears on the Amazon site as of 6-14-2006. It's not even close. Second, there are no demos on this. Am I missing something?? I preordered this to get the demos and all we have are live recordings. The sound on this is awful, very similar to the Stooges live recordings. If your familar with those, you know what I mean. I would have given it one star, but it is still a interesting listen, as I love The New York Dolls. I'm shocked they would release this the way it sounds. It appears to be a attempt to make money without putting a dime in cleaning up the sound on this. The Vancouver show is the only decent recording on this release."
3,Ahead of their Time,"As a Dolls fan, I bought this item as soon as I saw it. The song selectionis excellent, and is an amazing career overview. The only down side(althoughnot for me) is the sound quality. If that would deter one from buying this,your not as big a Dolls fan as you may have thought you were. A must have for any serious fan of The New York Dolls."
4,"It's Called the ""Bootleg"" Box, Folks!","So far I have made it through the first two discs. I don't think the sound is nearly as bad as some of the other reviewers. If you are familiar with ""real"" bootleg recordings from this era, it isn't bad at all, and Vancouver is excellent. What do you want from a a cult band 35 years ago? Lots of raw energy and prett hard-driving rock, freed from the studio production."
1,horrible quality,"This is not worth the money. The recording quality is worse than an audience B rating.Oddly, I am discovering that Amazon only publishes my reviews with a positive rating, wonder why. Sales?Let's see how this goes before I waste more of my time."
1,The History Channel Should Know Better,"First the good...there wasn't anything good.Why. The History Channel should never air something with so many untruths. Period.From the ""wrong timeline"" absurdity of Mike Collins smoking while at NASA. He quit before he was selected, per HIS OWN BOOK ""Carrying The Fire"".To stomach turning false friendships...Buzz Aldrin DID NOT coax a neck-sick Mike Collins out to jog, per BOTH OF THEIR BOOKS.I could go on, but I won't...If you are buying this because the History Channels logo is on it, you might want to question your History Channel DVD purchase of the past...I am thinking of returning ""The Nixon Tapes - How Do We Know For Sure That It Wasn't Rich Little."""
4,"Beautiful, beautiful history!",Watching this gives me all kinds of goosebumps as a history buff and someone who's dreamt of going to the stars!
5,Moon Shot worth the watch,"This video is informative and entertaining. It gives you a feel for what astronauts had to endure during training, crew chemistry and being in the media lime light. This is good enough for movie night or use in the classroom."
2,A very bad version,"With a already 5 star documentry in VHS, why would anyone attempt to duplicate a lousey remake like this one. Naming it or otherwise using the same name as MOONSHOT is a discredit to the original. Poor judgement or lack of, maybe exercising correct reasoning isn't rocket science but Why would anyone produce such a Dud. Luckily for most people, They'll have a VHS original and will be holding their breath until someone comes to their senses and transfers this to DVD."
5,Excellent for people who know some programming,"This is a very solid book. It assumes you know the basics of programming like loops, modules and the likes... If you are familiar with any regular programming language (like C, C++, Java, PERL, python, ruby, even shell scripting) then this books is probably your best bet to learn C# quickly.There is no whole chapters made to get you to write a ""for"" loop here, you must have programming concepts to really benefit from this book.As a programmer, I really enjoyed it and was able to get to work quickly on C# programs. If you are totaly new to programming, get another book to get your feet wet before jumping on this one."
4,Great For Experienced Programmers,"This a a very good book for someone who has programming experience. Fundamental concepts are in the book, but they are not belabored. The book quickly gets on with C# and what it takes to create real applications that do something more than say ""Hello World"".If this is your first experience with programming, then this book is not for you. If you have done some programming and are moving to C# for the first time, then this book is a great addition to your library."
4,Worth the money,I think dollar to dollar this product can be the best value . Great blowing power and easy to follow directions and use. Only drawback istead of a triger for adjustable speed you have one button with two settings ( hi-lo ) .
3,Weedeater Electric Blower,"I have owned one of these for about three years and find the conversion from blower to mulcher to be awkward. It requires a tool to open the bottom hatch and the suction tubing is both hard to attach and remove. The tubing sections also have a tendency to separate. Suctioning debris requires one to stoop and the collection bag tends to sag or fall off of your shoulder. It works well as a blower and I particularly like the optional gutter attachment. When used as a mulcher, it compacts the material very well but I think the comfort and convenience could use some redesign. The Black & Decker product line looks better to me although I have not used one."
5,Loved it!,Spiced up the holidays! Seriously? There's a word requirement for reviews? That's silly! Don't know what else to say ...
5,I've watched this twice...in 24 hours that is,"Great set list, great sound, great band. Shot really well. A fav band of mine, and now a fav dvd. If you are in any way a fan and are moderately curious about purchasing this, DO IT. Easily worth twice the price, I can't see how you could be disappointed, Jaz and the guys are as intense as ever. Young drummer Ben does an incredible job as well, I have to say...""It's a total INVASION!!!!"""
3,"Hard-hitting, politically motivated material","Influential post-punk rock group celebrates a quarter of a century with a homecoming show that's packed with seventeen of their most hard-hitting, politically motivated material. Visually, the show isn't much to brag about, but the music is more than enough to make an impact. It's kind of difficult to take their political views seriously when their frontman performs with joker make-up on."
1,Can't play,I'm sure it's a great dvd but unfortunately I can't play it on my dvd recorder in Belgium. Is it exchangeable for a suitable version in europe ?Killing Joke - XXV Gathering: The Band That Preys Together Stays Together
4,Spiffy new collection of instrumentals from Innocence Mission guy,"Don Peris has taken a departure from his band The Innocence Mission to record a fine collection of gentle, melodic instrumentals featuring his excellent guitar work (and he plays nearly everything else too). These themes are by turns grand, nostalgic, quaint, romantic and beautiful. Don wrote just about all the tracks except for a lovely, meditative version of the Ravel Pavane. There are also a couple of vocal tracks along the way, ""North Atlantic Sand,"" a duet with Karen Peris that could easily have come from an Innocence Mission album; and ""Young As You Feel,"" with Denison Witmer. In all, Go When The Morning Shineth made for a very pleasurable listening experience."
3,Great match for Cracker Barrel Flat Skillet,"Works great with the Cracker Barrel cast iron 10 1/4"" flat skillet. This lid is very deep to allow for steaks to fit inside.Price is too high."
3,30 GB Zune Acrylic case,"The case works as advertised. Provides good protection, a little hard getting the unit in and out. One problem that I have noted is the hold swith on the Zune gets pushed down causing the Zune to get stuck in the hold position. The little stand/clip works well when viewing videos on the Zune."
3,An ok product.,This is an ok case and it does protect my zune. The only reason why I took off stars is because it is 1. really bulky and 2. REALLY hard to get it out of its case. Also the cover get scratched fairly easily so I usually take it off to watch movies.
3,fast shipping,"I bought this for my zune and it came pretty fast. It fits well, but makes the already large zune larger. But it does it's protecting job pretty well because of how big it is and that was all I was concerned about."
4,Very good product,"It is very good product. you receive exactly what you ordered. May be I was too naive to think acould open initially the case without a MANUAL! but what I got was a injured finger. And of course, as soon as I open it, I could figure out what I was doing wrong. I suggest to include a labeled push here to open or something for that very first time."
2,Yeah! Plastic,"This ""Product"" is just plastic I don't know why I bought it. It makes your Zune unusable but protected by 2 inches of Plastic on all sides."
3,Tough but pricey.,"Tough case with a nice fit but adds significant bulk to the player. I purchased this case for my son but decided to get the silicone skin ones for myself. The soft cases are really nice fitting with a good feel and adds protection without being bulky (also making it easier to get to all the controls). Best of all, the silicone cases are less than 1/2 the price of these."
1,Not even okay; horrible,"I don't like this case- it's not really needed for the Zune. You don't need a case; the Zune is so thick it will never scratch.If you buy the Belkin TunePower it won't be possible for you to charge it with it inside the TunePower; I was never told this. You can plug it on the Belkin TunePower but you can't place it inside the TunePower.Another major problem is that you can't take your Zune out when you put it in! It's almost IMPOSSIBLE too! Maybe you can but if you have long fingers and short nails like I do, it's just not possible. Definitely annoying.If you plan to buy other accessories for your Zune: DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY and BUY THIS!!! Otherwise, feel free to buy."
4,Another Decent Release By The Big Man!,"This is an interestingly different blues recording from Popa Chubby. There are plenty of noteworthy guitar licks and all original tunes, with the lone exception of the cover of Jessie Mae Hemphill's ""In This World"". As you might expect from this unusually large man, he is all over the place on this recording. The CD opens with ""Slide Devil Man Slide"" with lyrics spoken in a manner which made me recall the 70's ""Hot Rod Lincoln"" by Commander Cody. He maintains that rather awkward style on two other tracks, ""Young Guns"" and ""Smugglers Game."" While that is style will not appeal to everyone, Popa returns to a rocking blues style on songs like ""Long Deep Hard and Wide"" and two up-tempo instrumentals, ""Kinda Dicey"" and ""Buffalo Chips."" To me the standout track is the mid tempo ""Why I Can't Have You."" Overall, this is not as good as some of Popa's earlier releases but in this day of cookie cutter blues, the originality of this composition is worth noting."
2,Emergency Kit,"I ordered 4 of these for my family to put in their cars. Light weight to carry if necc. I figured they are practical. Later I can get better tents if needed. If I had to carry one, it has to be light weight. 60 yr old female carring her own stuff. More then likely, I will chose to stay home. Too old for all that silly stuff of survival. It is 3 season tent. Very important to me. At least I know my family will have this shelter if needed.Update: received the tents, on the box they come in states ""two season tents"" The ad above states "" 3 season"". I am disapointed in this, but I am not sure about the difference in 2 & 3 season tents. I maybe sending it back, unless there is not much difference in the 2 & 3 season type. I am really disapointed in this. I did not even notice this until I was showing my son the tent."
4,For grandkids,"Bought this for the grandkids,to camp in the backyard.I like it a lot,and they did also.I will buy one for me also."
5,Great Historical Maps,"I bought this book for my husband as a Christmas present because of his fascination with old maps. Of course, I had to take a look through it before giving it to him to make sure it lived up to the reviews I had read. It did! Along with several good maps of the early days of the southeastern United States, there are essays on each one, describing their origin and development. Of course, my husband should be the one who writes this review because he absolutely fell in love with this book. His high praise of its maps and essays is the best recommendation I could give to anyone interested in old maps and their history."
4,Excellent guide to an amazing expressionist,"In Germany, it is easy to study the amazing work of Max Beckmann, but those of us who enjoy his work in the US have to rely on books and the internet. He excels as no other at depicting the horror of the early decades of 20th century Germany. This book has an excellent 46-page summary of his life and work, with comprehensive analysis of 40 color plates of his major works. The symbolism in his paintings is extensively reviewed. The author, Dr. Stephan Lackner, was a longtime friend and patron of the artist."
5,A Welcome Change in Sytemic Thinking,"This book presents a revolutionary, yet simple thesis on the Bible's teaching about ""divorce."" For too many years churches have burdened divorced individuals with the feeling that they are somehow now ""disqualified"" because of it. Divorce has been treated as an almost ""unpardonable sin."" Callison's book dispells this attitude and belief by simply pointing out the translations of the O.T. Hebrew words and the N.T. Greek words used for ""bill of divorce"" and ""putting away."" It is a welcome message that should help countless divorced people regain the joy of their relationship with God."
4,Great Western Series,This is a fine addition to my Lonesome Dove collection. This is one I will watch over and over.
3,Great Movie,"I love the Lonesome Dove series, what I am disappointed inis the missing pieces on most DVDs. Missing small bits andmissing the ending on two of the DVDs."
4,great album,saw this band recently and the new girl singer is wonderful. She is on the album and it is great.
4,excellent music,If you are familiar with this music then you already know your going to love this CD I recomend this to any Asleep at the Wheel fan
1,didn't hold up in the long run,"I have had this pan for four years, and it is completely pitted and the nonstick coating is peeling off. It has never seen a metal utensil -- we only have plastic and wood utensils, so I guess the nonstick coating was either put on badly or not enough was applied at the factory. I'm kind of grossed out to think how much Teflon we ingested before I noticed the pitting. I would not buy this pan again."
1,Do not waste your money!!!,"This bits comes without sharped edge, are very short to be usefull. Pooor quality and machining results like the quality of this pieces of junk. Very desappointing results.."
2,Short,"The bits are very short. To be fair the size is published, I just did not pay attention. The short length really limits your ability to make deep cuts, it does not allow enough extension over the tool holder edge."
3,light duty only,"This is a good deal for the price, but I wouldn't expect it to last a long time in a hard production environment, or when used in a location shoot. I use this stand to support a homemade soft keylight that only weighs about 10 lbs and equally distributes it's weight over the cross bar. I would feel mighty uncomfortable using this stand to support heavier lights without being very, very careful to evenly distribute the weight due to the lack of angle supports for the crossbar. Still, in a controlled studio environment it should be fine."
3,9FT Wobble,"Only three lights up in the air, and I'm worried about... everything.It tilts to one side... and wobbles- The fine threaded screws stripped at a gig, leaving me with a 5' light stand. The hardware was replaced, and i drilled pin holes to keep my lights up. one bump and my T-bar spins in circles. The tubing in very skinny, and the legs are springy. it lasted about 6 months."
3,"I have received not the New item, it's definetely used one",I have received a used item as I found the small scratches on the top bar + the inner box was wornMulti time taped on the box. The bolt and nuts are also anybody can tell. Watch out this distributer
1,Junk!,"one Star because it resembles a light Stand.Mine came with a broken Sleeve,missing knobs,packaged and repackaged several times. 3/4""tubing is not a light stand.Very Disapointed."
3,ummm...its in between toy,"this is a cute product...we got it for our six month old daughter...because she loves lights and music, and saw that this won some toy awards..shes will play with it a little bit, but is not crazy about it...maybe she will grow into it, when she has better hand-eye coordination...all and all i would say that it was a pretty good product, but a little pricey...considering"
2,A little disappointed,"My 7 mos. old daughter received this for Christmas (2006). There are several flaws. Although it is big and kind of wraps around the baby, her foot is right by one of the trap doors where the balls come out and so it gets blocked. Also a big flaw is the center of it. The ball sometimes gets stuck in there. It needs to be more of a slope because the balls sometimes stop rolling once they get to the bottom. And... the dinosaur head does not always go back to the ""upright"" position and so the ball sometimes gets stuck.ALL IN ALL: Needs to go back to the drawing board. Then buy it."
3,Not as great as it looks.,"The toy is really cute and looks like fun, but my son won't play with it. He got it when he was 9 months, so I'm hoping that when he's a little older he'll get into it. My son quickly figured out how to push the little buttons inside each hole to start the sounds, but doesn't care about putting the balls into them. He was bored after having the toy a week. For as large as the toy is there is no ball storage for the rollarounds and limited sounds, so you hear the same thing over and over. It now collects dust in my son's room. Wouldn't waste your money."
4,My 10 month old loves this!,Very easy to assemble. Nick picks up the peak a boo blocks easily. There are 4 holes to put the ball and they all come out different openings. Very fun. Need a larger place to store.
3,An okay toy,"When we first got this toy my girls played with it more often but the fun wore off after a few weeks. Now they do not really play with it much but some kids will probably love it. We have also had the balls get stuck inside the dino but have never had anyone get an arm stuck (although I can see how it can happen). I have had my 10 month old tip the dino over when she was trying to stand up using it as leverage. If you place the toy against something this problem is solved. It is also solved by being right there at all times but lets face it, it takes 2 seconds for your child to pull to standing and tip it over and if you have more than one child you can't always be watching every second. I would say this toy is okay but I have found others that are much better."
2,Not used much,"This was a gift. I would not have bought it now that it has been here for months with little use. The kids just are not interested in it. The balls with different textures are a great idea but the holes are too small so the balls often get stuck. Another reviewer complained about the head coming off easily. I agree but that has not happened in my house since no one is really interested in this toy. Aside from boring and defective, the music is awful. This one is a dud...don't bother."
4,"Very durable, quality toy",This toy holds up really well to the use of my two little ones. My three-year old is still interested in it at times. The balls get played with alot away from the dinosaur as well.
5,Great Toy for Little Ones,"This toy is really great. My baby and toddler love it. It teaches cause and effect and has fun lights and sounds. Each opening sends the ball down a different path, so there's always something new to see each time."
3,"Fun, but be careful!","We bought this for our 9mnth old son thinking he would love all the action. And he did for a little while. It took a little while for him to get the hang of it and once he did he lost interest fast! My biggest concern though was when he started pulling up on it! It tipped very easily. Thank goodness I was there to catch him. So put it up against the bed or wall if your child is stand. Overall fun, but be watchful!"
5,My son loves this toy!!!,"My son is 6 months old and loves this toy! I sit with him and put the balls through and he plays with the head and butterfly. He really doesnt bore with it, actually I get tired of playing with it before he does. He loves the lights and music. My son is very rough and grabs the dino's head at the mouth and tugs it really hard and after reading one of the earlier reviews i tugged on the head and it was very sturdy and did not come off! This was and is a great first toy for him and I'm extreamly pleased with our purchase!"
3,Kinda lame!,"This toy is quite large, it takes up alot of space compared to most toys. My dd got it for her first birthday and has had it 3 months and only plays with it maybe once a week for 5 min. So totally not worth my money. But I am sure some kids might enjoy it more."
4,Growing into it,"My son got this toy early (when he was 4 months), so in the beginning he didn't so much play with it as watch us play with it. Didn't bother us since we knew it was for older babies.As he's gotten older he's started using more and more parts of it. He's 9 months now and the only thing he doesn't do is put the balls in the holes (he plays with all the other parts of it and seems to like it best when we put he balls in. He now knows where they'll come out so he waits and grabs them as they appear - he finds this vastly entertaining.Overall, we really like this - it's fun for us, it's fun for him. And hopefully he'll use it to it's full extent as he gets older. I think in general the age recommendation for this is off; it should be for older (maybe starting around a year?). But it's still very safe for younger babies.Only downside is the construction; since it's molded plastic the balls sometimes get stuck where the plastic pieces won't perfectly join."
1,Stuck Foot - watch carefully!!,My 22 month old had put his foot into the bottom right opening on the dinosaur 4 times in the last 2 days. His entire foot has been stuck. He is unable to remove his foot out of the hole. It has taken both of his parents working together for several minutes to extract his foot out of the hole. He became very upset and slight bruising to his ankle area where he has tried to remove his foot from the toy.
3,"It's Okay, but Nothing Special","My son received this as a first birthday gift, and I tried to take it back. We don't normally buy noisy, no-point toys...He absolutely loved it the week we found out Toys R Us won't take toys back without a receipt... Learning to put the balls in the holes on his own was exciting for him and he does dance to the music. We left it in the corner, and a few times a day, he walks over and puts a ball the one of the holes... NEVER the middle hole anymore! He knows it won't come out!It's a silly thing that takes up a lot of space, but he likes the balls and his playmates love it when they come over since none of them have it..."
2,Not too exciting,"I thought my son would love it, however it only holds his attention for a few short minutes. At this point, he is 10 months old, and I still have to put the balls in the holes for him. He does not have the ability to do it independently yet. Hopefully, before he outgrows it completely, he will be able to play independently. I will say though, he enjoys the lights and the music."
2,Seriously? $[...] they want for this thing?,"Okay, I bought this last year for my then 1-year-old. At the time he wasn't walking and he would try to use it to pull up on. It always toppled over. And since he's become mobile, he'd rather climb on it than use it the way it is meant to be used. He doesn't bother with the balls and just pushes the buttons to make the lights and songs turn on. All that said, for $[...] or so, it's not a bad buy. But now they are asking $[...] for these. That's just absolutely ridiculous. Totally a rip-off. If you go on ebay or craigslist, you can find them for $[...]. And they are easy to find."
5,"The roar could use some work, but the kid loves it!","I've heard better roars in my day! My 1 year old plays with this thing for HOURS and I can be a lazy parent and just watch and encourage. Put the balls in the hole and they come out another hole.. that's the name of the game. The balls end up all over the house, but that's what I'd expect from a one year old. He stands on it, sits on it, and it lasts."
4,"Entertains him for a long time, and the cat too!","I received this used from a friend and at first thought it may not go over so well, but my 11 month old loves it! He just learned how to put the balls in the holes and he will sit for a long time playing with this toy. Plus, he loves rolling the balls around on the table. The cat loves to watch the balls move around and play with the balls herself!I agree that the middle slot is poorly made and the balls get stuck in there a lot but it doesn't seem to bother my son."
3,Ok product...doesn't keep his attention,"We bought this for our 11 month old son for Christmas. It doesn't keep his attention. Granted, he is a bit of a busy body, but he won't sit in front of it long enough to really play with it. We also got him a musical table and he loves that! The Drop and Roar Dinosaur is very cute and I like the music and lights, but the balls get stuck in the chutes. I am not sure what age group this is good for, but my son doesn't really care for it."
4,Lots of fun!,"I bought this for my son when he was 8 months old. He learned rather quickly how to put the balls in the holes (which we were thrilled about!). I feared that he'd tire of it pretty quickly, however. Now at almost 11 months he still stops to play with it about once a day. I enjoy that it's so sturdy (since my son uses it to crawl over quite frequently). I was wary of buying this because of the ill comments about how the pendulum gets stuck. Ours has only stuck every once in a while; not a big enough deal to not buy it. Too, sometimes the ball doesn't come all the way out from the middle hole (with pendulum). I don't know if it's just uneven plastic on ours or if that's how all of them are. Like I said, though, it's enough fun for the babies to get it anyway."
3,It's alright,My daughter is only 8 months old and got this toy AFTER Christmas when it went on sale (it's on sale for 21$ at wal-mart now). She doesn't care for it much. Maybe when she gets older.
4,Lots of fun,This is a great toy for the little ones to help them learn and play at the same time. You can also buy more of the animal plastic balls that can be used for this set. He watches to see the balls come out of the dinosaurs mouth and tail and little doorways. Then puts them back in the slots to do it all over again and to hear the music and sounds.
1,Should be recalled,"My 1-year-old received this toy as a Christmas present. It was opened and put together on a Saturday; by Tuesday she had taken the Peek-a-Boo Door off. A small (Cheerio size) plastic piece of the hinge came off with it. I found the piece before she was able to put it in her mouth, ear or nose. Clearly this could have been a choking hazard or some other hazard. I called Fisher Price and its going back to them."
4,My son loves the music!,"My son got this for his first birthday; we were waiting for it to come out. I don't really have any complaints, but he hasn't quite figured out how to put the balls in the holes on the front of the toy. The Roll a Rounds that come with it are ADORABLE. Damien loves to pull up on it and bounce with the music. Right now it is a toy that he can't really play with alone, but I don't mind playing with him!"
2,no interest to our baby,"Our son got this toy when he was 6mths old and still at 12 mths he could care less about it. In fact the only use it gets is him crawling on it to get to something out of reach. He has played with it a few times but only because we were sitting right there playing with it with him.The balls get stuck in the middle hole and our son likes the sound and lights and all he does it stick his finger in the hole and make the sound and lights go off without the ball.Out of 6 mths he has maybe played with it five times (again because we were playing with it to get him to play with it) for about 2 minutes. Glad we didn't waste our money on it, instead it was a gift."
4,Good toy,My daughter loves to play with this. She loves the music. This toy also helps to improve her small moter skills. The only bad thing is that the balls get stuck sometimes.
4,your toddler's own personal dinosaur,"This is a great toy, but it does take up a lot of space. The balls are perfect for 1 year old hands. It would be nice if it had a ""lights only"" function, but it is fun for them as is. Our toddler has figured out all kinds of things to do with it - besides just letting the balls roll around. I do recommend this if you've got enough space for one more over-sized piece of plastic!"
5,great toy,I bought this for my one year old niece for Christmas and she loved it. It is large and sturdy and cheerful to look at. The balls are just the right size for little hands to pick up they come out at different places which keeps it interesting. Very nice toy.
5,A wonderful product!,I got this for my one yr old daughter for her birthday! Even her two older brothers really enjoy it! It was worth the money!
5,Entertaining!,"We bought this for my 9 month old for Christmas and she really only enjoys the roll-around balls right now, since she hasn't quite figured out how to drop the balls into the dinosaur. However, my 3 year old loves this! I have even ""caught"" my 7 and 9 year olds playing with it too. It is very durable, good colors, nice music sounds to reward the ball in the hole and I can see our family enjoying this for a long time to come."
5,Great toy,"The dinosaur is both cute and fun. My son loves all the colors and the different sounds, and it is interesting enought that even my 5 year old joins him to play with it."
4,Very pleased,We bought this item for our 4 month old daughter for Christmas. She was just starting to pull herself into a standing position (she's advanced) and it was very stable and didn't tip when she did so. She loved the chew toys in top and the pink butterfly on the left side. I think it would be much better if it had more educational values. Such as a-b-c's or counting. But she's now 7 months old and still loves it.
4,cute!,"My hsband and I where excited to get this for our daughters 1st birthday. She really loves to play with it, and loves the lights that flash and music that plays when she puts a ball through the holes. Even my 4 year old enjoys playing with it (though I think that is more because it belongs to her sister more than anything else) It's nice because it helps them to share and take turns. It only comes with 4 balls, but you can get more roll-a-rounds to go with it. The only problem that I really have with it is that it has no where to store the balls, so they end up all over my house. However, that would probably happen even if there was a storage place. So, if you don't mind noisey toys, I think this is a nice one to get."
2,"definitely not what I and my son ""expected""","I like this toy more than my 10-month-old son. I like to use it as a sort of ""fence"" so that he does not crawl to ""off-limits"" areas of the room. He likes somewhat the balls but he is absolutely not interested to learn how to put them in the holes. The music attracts him for a very, very short while. He uses the dino though to lean and help himself get on his feet sometimes. I was hoping he could do more with it. The balls get stuck very often, which is pretty disappointing for a prize-wining toy. The roar is very disappointing too.I hope he will learn to play differently with it in a near future."
1,Dangerous....................,"At first I loved this toy. My son got this toy for Christmas when he was almost 16 months old. Sometimes the balls would get stuck inside the toy, which really didn't matter much until one day when my son was about 23 months old. My son got his arm stuck the circle on the orange plate and even somehow managed to twist his arm once in the toy. I had to unscrew the back in order to get his arm out. It took about 45 minutes and it felt like eternity. Needless to say my mom threw the toy out the very same night."
4,Love the dinosaur,We bought this dino for our son for his first Christmas and he LOVED it. It is very enterraining and makes some cute noises and plays cute songs. And when you get sick of hearing it you can turn it off but the kids can still paly with it. the balls that come with it are clear and have different items inside so the balls alone are fun toplay with too. Our whole family has loved playing with the dino and laughed alot when we did.
3,It should say 12m+,"I bought this toy for my daughter because it's so popular. Well when I took it out of the box I noticed that the butterfly was not attatched properly, it only one stand and it had a plastic ""plug"" on the other hole. The slot that drops the ball out of the mouth never plays the music unless I press the button and the balls always get stuck in the holes. My daughter does enjoy this toy now at 12 months but I had bought it for her at 8 months and she didn't care for it also she was just learning to pull up and she tried that with the dinosaur and she would always fall onto of it. I think the Roll-A-Round balls are appropriate for 6 month olds but the dinosaur should be labeled 12m+. Now that she does play with it, I do think it's a great toy."
4,great learning toy!!,"This is a great toy for the young ones,, they learn so many things, and it brings a smile to thier face when they hear the music and see the balls drop and come out at different places!!"
4,Graphic SF Reader,"Black Adam takes over.Getting sick of what had been happening to his former country, Adam recruits some metahumans, including some heroes, to do something about it. In particular, Atom Smasher.The JSA decide to stick their noses in, and it gets very bloody indeed. Not a pretty fight, this one, or result."
4,5 Stars for everything but the scent,"I love method products and took the plunge with this purchase. Based on the reviewer that loves this scent, I went with it because it was the best priced.Well, it works like a dream.The scent is not bad at all, but I definitely prefer the Ginger yuzu scent - that is the bomb! But way too expensive. At least my kitchen will be clean now - by the way, this stuff is magic cleaner for the oven top!!!"
4,Love the smell!,This is an organic product which smells great and cleans well. I always have people walk into my home and ask what the wonderful scent is.
2,undeliverable,"this should have arrived a couple of days ago so i checked the tracking today; it says its undeliverable. i love the product, but not when i pay for it and don't get it. I'm sure there must be a way to get my money back without 'returning' something i don't have. Any ideas??"
5,Method Junky!,I love this cleaner! When I was pregnant I became a Method junky. This is a great deal and the smell is a good one! 5 Stars!
4,Kitchen duty,"I like the cleaning power in the kitchen, but does a poor job on soap scum in the bathroom. This cuts grease, takes off fingerprints and works wonders on the kid's ""drawings"". I do like this for most light to medium cleaning, but it doesn't cut it on the tough stuff."
5,Best tool ever invented,"I am from New York,I have alot of buildings. This tool should never,never been discontinued! I make tools and invent things at home all the time and this the best tool I have ever bought! Yes it bends but you learn to use it properly and bend it back, very easy if you are not Lazy in the first place! Very disappointed with this being discontiued!"
1,FLIMSY,We bought this today at a local hardware store and the metal frame bent after the first use. We intend to return it.
1,very unsafe!,"My daughter is one of the many infants that has been hurt by this contraption. She's learning how to crawl and pulls herself up on the tunnel handle, well they have made this thing so light that it just comes over right on top of her. My daughter was terrified the first time it happend. Ive put it away since then, glad it was a gift from grandma and I didnt by it!"
2,Could have been great!!,"Like other reviewers here my 10-month-old son received the Activity Tunnel as a Christmas gift to go with his Activity Wall, also a Christmas gift. And like other 10-month olds he immediately tried to pull up on it and it toppled over on top of him, but at least he began to laugh!Fisher-Price should have designed the tunnel to attach to the the rest of the activity wall set and then it would have been stable!! My son still enjoys the tunnel upside down or sideways so I haven't fully decided whether or not to return it. Luckily I only paid $20.00 for it, but I definitely do not think it's worth the full $30.00!!!"
3,A little disappointed,"My son received this item as a gift when he was born. I thought it looked interesting and fun. The recommend age is 6 months. So when he was 6 months, I introduced it to him. He had absolutely no interest in it. As another writer mentioned, it became a toy holder. However, after about 2-2 1/2 months, my son started to play with it. I was actally getting ready to pack it away. He is now 11 months old, and enjoys it for short periods of time. He likes to make the lights and music go off. He will crawl through it from time to time. He actually likes the clicking and spinning contraptions on the legs the best. I was oringally excited, then disappointed, but I guess it turned out ok."
1,TOTALLY UNSAFE!!! DO NOT BUY THIS TOY!,"This toy is very lightweight. My daughter loves to pull up on everything, but the first time she tried, she fell straight back. If the toy is made for the age when babies are pulling up on everything, why make something that falls over? I'd rather have my daughter pull up on furniture! Love the playwall that goes with it - this should have been made as sturdy as that product, or at least somehow attached to it so that it would be safe! Very very dangerous!"
2,"Poor design, pretty unsafe","My son got this for Christmas this year from a friend of mine. It's not one of Fisher-Price's finest, that for sure! Although the lights and music are fun, it is like others have said pretty unsafe. Pretty much any child that is at the proper age for a toy like this is going to try to pull themself up with it, and odds are they'll fall over with this thing landing on top of them! My son is a tuff little guy and he hasn't been hurt by it at all, but it did however scare him pretty good the first time it tipped over on him and if I wasn't right there he would have been stuck under it. He still plays with it, but now we have it up agaist a stand so it can't fall over.If your looking for a tunnel type toy for your little one to crawl through, look else where!"
3,Needs Improvement,"My son loves this tunnel... however Fisher Price needs to put weights in the legs so babies that are learning to pull up do not pull it over on themselves. They should know better! Other than that, it is a great toy!"
1,Black eyed Baby Girl,"I agree with the prior comments on this items safety. My 10 month old daughter pulled the tunnel over while trying to stand up. She has the gymtastics wall that is designed for standing as well. Needless to say she now has a nasty black eye. I am not impressed with the item at all. I do not recommend spending your money on it. As for the Gymtastics Wall, that toy is great!!"
1,Very unsafe!,"I bought this on clearance at BRU last night for my 8 month old daughter and returned it this morning. As everyone else said, it tipped over every time she tried to pull up on it (on carpet). I was afraid to leave her alone with it.Also, the box implied it attached to the Baby Gymtastics playwall (which we love), but really it just sits next to it.Poorly designed product - maybe they are taking it off the market since I found it on clearance."
3,Fun for Crawlers,"We got this toy for my daughter at Xmas time and she wasn't quite crawling. Now at 8 months she is crawling all over and loves to crawl through this toy. She also likes to pull herself up on it and dance to the music. She loves to play with the toys that come off of this. Other reviewers were correct in saying it's light weight so it tips easily, but if you hold it down a bit while the baby is playing on it, it is a lot of fun. I don't have the play wall to go with this toy, I think I am going to buy the Laugh and Learn Learning Home instead."
2,Not sturdy...,My child started crawling at 6 months and soon after was pulling up. I thought that this tunnel along with the climbing wall was would be perfect for him. The first day I brought is home my child pulled it on top of him self. It is very unsturdy. Now that my child has a little more control he can pull himself on it without falling but that took him a little while. We do play peek-a-boo with the side curtains and he has learned to crawl under the sides (commando style) which has been fun to watch. The climbing wall I bought with this was a much better purchase and I do recommend that.
2,Not for advanced babies,"This toy might be good for babies that are not advanced. My baby is 8 months old and has been crawling, sitting and standing for a month now. She tried pulling up on the tunnel and it fell over on her. She grabbed the rattle toys and they hit her in the head. When I tried to take it apart...to return it, I couldn't! Once you snap the pieces in, they are in. You can't remove them. My husband even tried and we were afraid of breaking it so we stopped. If your baby is younger and learning to crawl and sit....this would be a fun toy. My daughter was very excited at first. After she couldn't pull up on it, she stopped playing with it."
2,What were they thinking?!?,"We just recently bought this along with the baby gymtastic wall for our twin girls and have already taken the tunnel back. We got it for their 1st birthday and I thought they might be bored with it but was wrong. They both loved it and especially loved when one of them was in the tunnel and the other was out. But the love didn't last long. It only took a day before they started pulling up on it and both my girls toppled over bringing the tunnel with them. After the 3rd time we said enough, packed it back up and took it back. I love FP items, as evident to our playroom, but seriously, what were they thinking. It would be one thing if it was an item only for crawling babies, but they market it with an item that is obviously for babies pulling up and cruising. Don't waste your money, unless you plan on holding it everytime your little one gets near it. Such a disappointment!"
2,Dangerous for little ones,I just bought this for my daughter who is 8 months and learning to stand and pull herself up. I wanted to warn other parents about the dangers of this toy...and see that many others have had the same problem. My daughter ends up falling backwards (which is traumatic enough) and then the tunnel falls on top of her and hits her in the face. A parent must supervise the use of this toy and hold it down while your little one holds on. I would not reccommend this toy!
1,FUN BUT NOT SAFE,"Yes, please do pay attention when people say this item is not safe and listen. It is not sturdy AT ALL, and my son is constantly pulling it over on himself. He is pretty good at standing, though, and knows how to use it to help him without always doing this. Since he absolutely loves crawling through it (in connection with our Baby Gymnastics toy), I haven't taken it away from him. For the most part, this toy doesn't really do anything so he's not too interested in it. I was lucky I found this item on a Christmas-leftover clearance pile for $14, b/c it's not worth any more than that. I definitely do not recommend this toy for any child unless you are literally attached to your baby 24/7 to make sure they won't pull it down and crack themselves in the head with it."
1,Fun if supervised...,This toy is very unstable and tipped when my daughter pushed on it. It toppled over and she fell over with it. After the incident she disregards the toy for the most part. She seems to like when I lay with my head inside the tunnel and play peek-a-boo out the sides.Buy this toy if you don't mind your kid falling over on top of it.
4,He likes it,"I received this as a christmas gift for my 9 month old, he loves it. He can stand but we have not yet had the problem of it falling with him. He doesn't really pay attention to the toys that are attached but loves to hide in it, he has played with it everyday for the past 2 weeks."
3,Baby loves this toy,"I have an 11 month old and he got this for Christmas. He absolutely loves crawling in it and out the sides. I've not had any problems with it toppling over, but my baby is very competent at pulling up, standing and cruising. My cat also likes to sleep on the top of it so perhaps that helps stabilize it somewhat. It is not the most sturdy toy but I hate to see all the trashy reviews. It is an excellent companion to the play wall. If baby is supervised, as with any toy, I don't see where there is a problem with this. Maybe putting a book on the top will eliminate the instability for those who's children love it but tend to pull it over. Just my 2 cents."
1,Not the best,"This product is fun for a while, but doesnt provide stability for a cruising baby/crawling baby. I would reccomend getting the fisher price baby gymnastics playwall. These are pricey at babiesrus, but at consignment shops they might have some that are gently used. We just bought ours for $25 dollars and its in very good shape!"
5,Great Price,The Nora Roberts collection is a must see the male lead is a terrific actor. The story line is very consistent throughout the movie. It is a must see.
3,Good for new believers,This book was not what I expected. I thought it would be a guide on how to pray successfully. Instead it looked at some Psalms and interpreted them. It is more of a theology book on Christianity than a learning tool on prayer. You can easily do without it if you are just learning about prayer. As a theology book it is actually quite good.
4,Spurgeon strikes again!,"What a blessing this little book was to me! I bought my copy off a rack at Publix and thought I'd get more to give as gifts this Christmas. Spurgeon speaks plainly to the everyman in all of us. He addresses our fears and anxieties and leads us to the solution, over and over. It never gets boring, even when his conclusions are the same. The most profound of lifes problems are addressed in this little book, dealt with thoroughly and drop kicked into the dustbin. Go Chuck, go!"
5,Peter Newpert worlds most self involved person ?,Peter Newpert - seriously could this guy be any more full of himself ? nice job generating return on investment of the $ 700 + million over at drugstore moron..
1,Don't trust the pictures - Don't buy this!,"The item pictured is not the item received. The blade belongs to a completely different sword, and the seller is obviously aware of this since the sword comes with a scabbard designed for it. They are intentionally deceiving their customers, and do not reply to their customer's attempts to contact them. The only response I have gotten back was an auto-reply when I sent my first request for exchange or refund, and nothing more."
2,Article was delivered did not match picture,"We were looking for cutlasses for the Drum majors at the local HS and bought them based on what we saw. The blade shape was not the same as what is pictured,they were just the wrong shape for a ctulass. The tip is sweeping and diamond shapped (wrong) and is way bigger and therefore way heaver than what we were looking for. I've had to do a lot of work cutting and grinding on them to make them look the way they we need them to look (as advertised was close that's whay we purchased them). We also had to make new scabbards for them to fit the new shape.I know, why not return them... We needed them for a field show and had less than a week when they arrived. It was better to rework them than send them back and try to rush something that we'd probably be equally dissapointed with.Bottom line - make sure your pictures match what they will be shipping."
2,Mermaid a bit too sexy,This is a good costume but it is completely see though. Let's just say it will take a spank-type undergarment to make it look good or I will fully line it. I love the sequin design but not how see through it is.
2,"This Guy graduated from a school that teaches writing, right","This book was very hard to read because it was about 90% incomplete sentences. Punctuation and grammar was...very bad. Except for a few pieces of information that actually sounded like biographical content, and a few biographies (of a sort), I really didn't understand what is his point. Now if I read in between the lines....well, the author seems like a total manic depressant who looks for outside drama as an excuse about why his life is a struggle. But I bet that he spends most of his time on the couch watching sports, instead of preparing for his, or his daughter's, future."
5,A CD you could take to a desert island.,"I bought this CD when it came out in vynil. Later on I bought the tape because the vynil was scratched. Then I got the CD. No matter what support you listen to it to, you'll love. I've been listening to it for roughly thirteen years and is one of the very few albums that have seen me through thick and thin. So many musicians and poets could benefit by listening to Mr Cohen..."
4,"Flawless Songs, Cheesy Arrangements","The songs contained on this release are absolutley stunning. Cohen mixes a world weary point of view with a dry dark humor, and his verbage so economical that not a word is wasted. Cohen may not have the ""golden voice"" that he jokes about in TOWER OF SONG, but he nails the vocals on every song here with just the right emotion and inflection.Then comes the backing tracks. This could be a primer on cliched 80's production values. Cheesy synthdrums, backing vocals worthy of Diane Warren songs and generic keyboards would destroy lesser artists or tunes. Only TOWER OF SONG and EVERYBODY KNOWS get treatments worthy of their fine lyrics and vocals.I would love to see Cohen redo this album with a sympathetic producer, who would frame these dignified tunes with the backing they so richly deserve. It never hurts to dream."
5,Whispering memories into my soul,"Like many others, I first heard this man sing on the soundtrack of Pump Up the Volume. Picking up the soundtrack album, however, I found a verstion of the song Everybody Knows by Concrete Blonds, and was confused.Then I found I'm Your Man.This is an album that lives on your turntable, disc player, whatever, for like 6 solid months, then you put it away. Then it calls you back.Jazz Police does break the album up, true, but it brings out the best of the rest, and the rest IS the best."
2,Review: I'm Your Man,"I was introduced to Cohan via Austin City Limits rebroadcast of 1988 program. The show was fantastic and I wanted an album. This album has many of the songs featured on the program. On the program, the singers and instrumentalists had solos. The album lacks these brilliant interludes. What we are left with is just Mr. Cohan's voice--""monotonal, gravel-on-velvet delivery"" which wears thin after a song or two."
5,The Poet as Songwriter,Leonard Cohen started out as a poet. Then he became a songwriter. His songs evolved into theatrical pieces which took on lives of their own. He's still evolving.
4,ain't no cure for love,"this is one of my favorite cohen's cds, unlike his more early work, which can be deep and beautiful, this albom has the addition of some very dark aura to it, the addition of a political massage, in songs like ""first we take manhatten"" or ""jazz police"" and also a lot about the proccess of writing music and the life of cohen as an artist (""take this woltz"", ""tower of songs""). for me this song always give me the feel of a trip to the early 80's in europ, or being in some artistic black and white movie, plus it has the tendency to feet my mood whenever i'm feeling down...it's not the first leonard cohen cd that you should listen to, but if you are a cohen's fan, this cd is a must."
3,"A mixed bag here, with a gem or two...","For my taste, 'Ain't No Cure for Love"" is the keeper on this CD, but I have friends who like ""First We'll Take Manhattan"" or ""I'm Your Man"" or ""Tower of Song"" better. I like the last three better by artists other than Leonard, and in fact, ""Ain't No Cure"" is even done better by Jennifer Warnes. As with most Cohen albums I've heard over 40 years, his love lyrics, happy or sad, are his strong suit. Overall, this is weaker than ""Various Positions"" and I recommend that one, and also his Greatest Hits stuff from the '60's and '70's, ahead of ""I'm Your Man."""
3,Occasionally great,"For fans of Leonard Cohen, this might come harsh: ""I'm Your Man"" is not a pop/rock masterpiece. However, it has six great songs which I have not yet tired of.The problem I have with this album are the ""poetic"" lyrics. In my opinion sometimes they amount to complete gibberish, ""Jazz Police"" being the prime example. Another thing that slightly bothered me was the somewhat dated production, which probably was very modern at the time of the publication of this CD.To end on a positive note: the mood of Leonard Cohen's singing is excellent throughout, especially in the last two songs. For a buyer unfamiliar with the artist's work, I strongly recommend listening (the whole CD) before buying."
4,Great for typographers with such particular interest,"This is one straight forward book. It delivers what it says: complete fontfaces from the early gothic period mainly on england, nordic, and celtic cultures. a complete set of characters of a font is spread on single pages, most of them at only one and the same point size. They vary from simple strokes to some of the most ornamented and complex sets ever created. Don't expect information concerning the background of the fonts or any other contextual related content."
3,tree stand umbrella,good product. unfortunatly i will have to modify to use. it screws into tree which is not allowed in new hampshire. wish it came with ability to strap to tree instead of screwing in.
2,roof tree umbrella stand,"The concept is very good. Some issues with installation. The tie straps were not long enough to go around the tree and the snaps used to attach to the umbrella come off too easy. Also the Pivot roller that the umbrella pole sits in would not keep the umbrella from tilting in a minor amount of wind. Once modifications were done to take care of these issues is worked pretty good. I would have liked to see gromet holes that secure the umbrella to the tree instead of snaps. Longer straps and a fixed ""L"" frame to provide more of a secure attachment to the tree. This may allow you to make it bigger as well."
5,Great,Just toss the seeds in and lightly covered and they started growing right away- will see in the spring if we get any flour out of the amount for a 15 by 15 area of use. If not can always turn over and use before spring planting.
4,great seed,this hard red wheat seed (chemical free) germinated very quickly and evenly in our garden; has been growing very rapidly without very much rain
5,Good seed,Good price for a large quantity and I get a good crop of wheat grass each time that my cats can enjoy.
1,Nonsense,"Although fun to read, this book relies almost exclusively upon English and Northern travel accounts, and their descriptions of Scots, Irish, Celtic, and American Southerners. Because they all share the same traits- lazy, drunken, idle, violent, uneducated- it is concluded that this Southern character directly stems from his Celtic ancestors.Although the South is clearly influenced by Celtic migration, the logic of following English accounts to portray Scots, Irish and Southerns as the same is illogical, considering English accounts of blacks and Native Americans (and almost every other culture they met) give the exact same descriptions. Suggesting that Africans and Scotsmen share the same decendancy, because Anglos have decribed both as lazy, violent and savage is ridiculous, yet this is exactly the logic that McWhiney follows.Scots and Irish influences are clearly felt in the South, but they are beyond the English and Northern comic book descriptions that McWhiney trusts"
2,Shoddy scholarship and racially divisive,"Like other reviewers here, I share the view that McWhiney's book rests on scholastically shaky ground. What no one has pointed out, however, is the extent to which his work is used to support the racist ideologies of the Neo-confederate movement, and the fact that McWhiney himself sits on the board of one if its most virulent organizations, The League of the South. Before you give your money to this man, please learn all you can about him."
1,Way off the mark!,"This book misses the mark almost completely! The south's culture and origins rests more in the Anglo-protestant tradition. The patriarchs of the south were mostly of English descent. Their plantations were mini-recreations of what they remembered the British Aristocracy to possess. Granted, there was a large Scottish influx in the south, especially in Virginia and North Carolina, the majority of Celtic Scots, Irishmen and Welsh settled in the North. It doesn't account for why more Irishmen, Scots and Welsh fought for the North and yet there was so much more hostility. Those Irishmen and Scots who fought in the North came from an Ireland and Scotland that was subject to the English and viewed the south, with its slavery, as a re-creation of what they'd left behind. They wanted no man to be subjected to such ways. The northern anglos referred to in this book came from the line of those who split with the crown. Cracker ways indeed! I wished I hadn't bought this one. It was a waste."
4,Kerouac - Selected Letters Review,Good book. I knew that Jack had his problems later in his life but this book really shows that he got off track in the late 50's rather than the 60's. This book reads real fast in that you can't put it down. It reveals the relationships that Jack had with the other Beat Poets among other people. I recommend this book to all interested in Kerouac and the Beat Generation.
4,Just Part 1,"Mr Elgie is being unfair when he complains that this tape does not cover the evolution of Britain since 1603AD. What he seems to have missed is that this is just the first of a two part series and that Part 2 will cover the period post 1603.I've not seen the video but have had very good reports of it from my family back in Britain. I have read the book though and certainly enjoyed it. I'm told that it covers more material than the video so together they probably make a good set.Mr Elgie's comments regarding the lack of depth are probably correct if the book is anything to go by. This is not necessarily a bad thing though as it provides the reader or viewer with a good overview of the whole 4,500 yr period. They can then identify those periods that are of greater interest to them and search out more detailed studies of them."
4,very good,"I really like the combination of science and spirituality, in any book. I like its combination in this book. Other reviewers say different things, which gives you an idea of the range covered. This book teaches Americans to be tolerant of ambiguity, something most Americans really need to learn.Taking the Quantum Leap: The New Physics for Nonscientiststalks about quantum mechanics, in a useful way; this book does roughly the same thing for chaos theory. It's worth the read."
3,Used for Research,Used this book for an analysis on the MENA revolution. Insights on course of events pertaining to certain situations were very useful. If you are looking for a deeper understanding of Chaos in this world or in one's day to day life this is a good source. For research it gave me a bit of a general understanding of Chaos observed from different angles.
3,How do I apply these lessons to improve my life?,"Just wanted to say that this is fascinating reading but I somehow expected that it would be less an explanation of the theory and more as to how one can take these lessons and apply it to one's job, social life, and how to make significant changes in one's everyday experience...in other words, as an engine of change. I am on the second reading and I still don't see how to accomplish this. Interesting reading if all you are looking for is an explanation...to be really specific, this weather guy, Lorenz, who discovered this chaos phenomenon while studying and trying to predict weather patterns , obviously provided the people in his field with lots of things to work on and they continue to apply this theory in their everyday work in trying to improve their predictions and to actually understand the phenomena of weather. I have no idea how to apply this in my life..and perhaps that was not the authors' intention in any case."
5,Think about it,"This is not a ""how to"" book but, rather, one that presents understandings based on chaos theory and shows how the same is undetood according to the same. One has to interpret the same for his or her self. It is an important work and is very worthwhile to read."
4,worth it,Very nice watch. I got it at a very good price. I was looking for a watch was not made in china and was a reasonable price. This is a great Swiss made watch and works just as expected. The luminous dial doesn't work as I would hope. It only works for a few minutes after being under a bright light. Other than that it is a great watch.
3,Not the watch in the photo,"Google this model number before you order!! The photo is not the watch you will receive from Amazon. The band is different! Otherwise, a nice watch. Nice size face, easy to read. Not as ""luminous"" as I would have prefered."
4,excellent watch,"I have had two of these watches and they are the best watch I have ever owned. They are completely waterproof, i have had so many watches stop running because they got moisture in them (I am always getting them wet). The reason i only gave 4 stars is that they broke for some off the wall reason. The stem broke off the first one and the second one the gears broke so i couldn't set the time. They lasted for a very long time so they were a great deal at that price. I am looking into buying another one, but I am considering upgrading to a ""fancier"" version."
5,Watch,Great item. I love the fact that it has both military time and regular time. It is stainless steel and is a very great product to wear in the hospital due to the material it is made of and waterproof.
1,Terrible,Nice looking watch ordered for a Christmas present. Worked for about a month- sent back to manufacturer who kept it for almost two months and I had to pay for shipping despite the situation. Pulled it out of the box and it worked for exactly one day and now its headed back to factory again! This time they are giving me a call tag so I won't have to pay shipping! Great! I just want a watch that works for my wife!
1,"""Junk""","I purchased this edger at my local Home Depot,used it and returned it that day. It simply does not have the power to edge. The blade stops rotating when the engine is under load. Do yourself a favor and spend a little more to get a low end McLane model, you will be glad you did"
3,Good for two years,"First two years, no issues, started 4-5 pulls. Have spent the past two years attempting to keep it running. Will not start so I replaced Gas Tank and rebuilt carb 3X's I just ordered an electric one just to save the hassle. Looking for a short term solution, it is ok. Longevity: nopperI purchased all weed eater products when moved and I only have one that is still running: (That would be a blower (knock on wood)"
1,Never again,"First day on the job it took 45 min to get it started. Lasted 10 minutes and died. It spent one month in a repair shop. They did all they could, it still takes forever to get it started. Dont waist your money."
3,OK - watch recoil,"A decent household unit - not for commercial use. Be wary of the recoil getting stuck in the ""out"" position. You need to tear the thing completely apart (not a job for the average home user) to reset the thing. You're almost better off buying new if you ever get the recoil stuck."
2,Easy to use but very short life,"I must be crazy but I just bought my 4th Weedeater PE550 Edger. I have back problems so the unit is ideal because it is lightweight and does a great job of edging the grass. The big problem is that they don't last long at all. If you are real lucky, you might get 3 years service before it wears out. The last one I bought just last fall has already died. The quality of these units is very poor. I tried the Troy Bilt 4 cycle last year but took it back because it didn't edge as well as the PE550. This would be a great edger if it would last longer. Considering the short life, it is over priced at $149. I don't think I will buy another one."
1,TERRIBLE customer Service,When I recieved this edger out of the box one of the wheels keeps falling off because an axle pin is missing. I contacted customer support which apparently is at husqvarna and even though it says a response will happen within 24 hours I haven't received one. I have posted 2 replies andit has been almost a month now with no acknowledgement.
1,"save your money, won't last the season","I bought this model last spring for the wife's birthday. by july it was dead, wouldn't start ever again. we probably used it 10 times. threw it in the trash last month while cleaning the garage. I bought same brand WEED EATER leaf blower at the same time, that made it until the fall.... you know when leaves fall and you really would like one! never happened, the pull cord recoil mechanism crapped out. so I'm guessing the whole line is junk. do some research and read these reviews they seem to be the best buyers guide. on products I have researched by reviews and purchased I have not been disappointed. I wish I reviewed these products first. but you know how you get sucked in by those home improvement stores. don't buy these products!"
2,2nd Weed Eater,"I have purchased two Weed Eater edgers, both of them lasted about 2 years. While very economical has far as price, these machines only have a shelf life of two years. The first edger's on/off switch broke inside, and was almost impossible to tear apart. The second edger, which I bought from Walmart for $99, simply quit working. I replaced the air filter, spark plug, and gas...still nothing. Save your money and buy a different brand. Junk!"
1,Weed Eater PE550 8-1/2-Inch 22cc 2-Cycle Gas-Powered Poweredge Lawn Edger,"****This item sucks do not waste your money.This item did not work when I got it. So I followed the instructions to contact the vendor and get it fixed at a store. The engine was destroyed and I hadn't even been able to use it. I highly suggest no one ever buy this item. Now Amazon says I cannot even return it. So I will never buy an item like this from Amazon again. Go to a store to get these kinds of items, if you do not want to loose your money."
3,Ok Edger,"This is actually a nice edger for a smaller, lighter duty yard. The good things: Light, easy to use, compact. Bad things; Loud and it has a plastic piece (Where a 'wheel' ought to be) that you drag along the ground. This of course starts to wear out as you use the machine. (Unless your not sliding ton concrete or install a wheel or slide guard yourself)A problem I had is that the hoses going to the gas tank to the carb have crumbled. (Fell apart.) Replacing these hoses is not as easy as one would think. First off, the gas tank doesnt come off easily. Once (If) you get the tank off, apparently their is some sort of filter thing inside the tank and once you pull the hoses, this filter comes off. I havent been able to put this back together yet so the thing is useless because of cheap plastic gas hoses. Im going to work at putting it back together but just FYI, watch those gas lines. They become gunked up and or might crumble after awhile."
5,A New Treasure,"Beautifully recorded solo document showcasing Bruce's formidable talents on fiddle, banjo, and guitar. He sings on a few numbers and his voice is pleasing enough. There is a nice variety of tunes and with the different instrumentation the program never goes stale. It's easy to recommend this cd, not only for the crystal clarity of the recording, but for the warmth and intimacy of the playing. It will become an audio companion for the coming years. Thank you Bruce."
5,AWESOME!!!,"This is the cutest little mirror! Actually...it isnt little at all. The description does not give it justice! There is a whole other play area on the back side, music, lights, rattles, etc! My 8 month old LOVES it. I have other taggies items - and absolutely love their blankies, toys and rattles. Seems expensive....but WELL worth it."
5,Awesome toy!,"My 3 month old was totally protesting tummy time until we got this toy. He loves it! Now he will sit for 5 or more minutes at a time looking at the mirror and pulling at the toys, when he previously started fussing after only 1 minute on his tummy. Also includes ties to hang on a crib, so I think we'll do that when he's older and can look at other things on his tummy. The only downside is that the angle is not great for looking at from the tummy, so we have to prop it up for him to see himself well."
4,Baby book.. bring back some of the 2003 options...pls,"I bought both this book and the 2003 version and really prefer this 2003 edition. I started making a baby book for the new baby and thought I had better get one organized for my 2 year old, hence the need for buying two books. This one is ok, but the 2003 edition is actually better because it has little pockets that you can store items in, like art work and other keepsakes you might want to hold on to and pass down to the child when they grow up. Both books are layed out similarly, and pretty much cover all of the basic info that you would want to keep track of and they are both pretty much presented in the same manner as well."
3,"Beautiful book, but not what I was looking for","This is the 3rd baby book I ordered, after several disappointing attempts. The reviews were so strong that I was excited to receive the book. When it arrived, it was just lovely. It would hold loads of information, with space and section for each year. But the book itself left me a little cold. There was no warmth or charm to it. Most pages are just lines where the parent fills in the information. Age, name, family tree etc. It felt more like a guess book at a wedding than a baby record book--just the facts. There was not a spot for any religious ceremony records, which I wanted. There were also no photos sheets, just places you could take pictures. I think I will give this as a gift, but it is not right for the records I want to keep for my second child."
5,Baby album,This is the perfect book for our new baby. It arrived in great condition and I began making entries right away.
3,Depends on your needs,"I've found this book to be exhaustive. Yes, it's fun to capture moments but this goes on for 5 years, and some of things it asks for I frankly am not going to care about 5 years from now. If your looking for something to document the milestones get something else. If you want to document ever little hair that they lose then this is the book you'll want."
5,Hands Down BEST Baby Book Ever,"I bought this book when my oldest was almost 1 year old. I had another before that was just specific to the first year. I wanted something that held more information and pictures and went on for several years. As I am a ""crazy"" record keeping scrapbooker, lol! I bought this one at the book store as it was the only birth-5 year one they had in stock. I am in love with it! It holds all the info I could ever want to keep. Lots of room for pictures! And lots of space for making a scrapbook like page design! I have filled mine with stickers and photos! It was very sad when my oldest turned 5 and her book was DONE! I had to hunt down and eventually special order this same book for my other 2 children! I would have nothing less! I now have baby books that I am proud to show off and I am excited to be able to look back so easily on my childrens infancys and early childhoods!"
4,"so far, so good","I purchased this book based on some of the other reviews and listed features. I have not been disappointed yet, although there was not as much room for capturing some things as I would have liked. I don't think any book would have been right though and started a separate journal. Our son is only 4 months old so that's as far as we've gotten but there are lots of spaces for pictures and I like that the first year is broken down by each month. SO much happens then! I think the quality is very good and having the box to store it in is even more insurance that it will stay nice. I would definitely recommend this to a friend."
2,This is not Perfume Tree but is instead a group called Perfume.,"It is a fine Album but if you are looking for Perfume Tree, you will be greatly disapointed as it is a completely different genre."
3,No Worries,"This story is about a young boy who grows up on a farm. He wakes up everyday to pretty much the same thing. To start his day he gets his dog, and heads down to his fishing spot. The day is unusualy hot, and everything is hiding from the sun, including the fish. He sees a storm in the far off distence and heads home. When he gets there he helps get all the animals in the barn so they don't get muddy. It is a decent story that tells about country life."
4,Only one improvement needed,"This is a wonderful little unit. I use it in my bedroom and it provides a nice sound. The only change I would make is to the display. It is impossible to read the time. The display is just not good. But, in terms of the sound, this is a very nice addition to any room."
2,"Great sound, cheap design","The unit sounded great after set-up. I never could get the cassette player to work, and after three weeks any CD started skipping. After 4 weeks, no more cd's, just the radio. The user interface is pretty tough to understand and read as well. The unit has a lot of features for the price...I decided I want something that will last a few years and I'm willing to pay more."
1,Bad Sequel,"I really like ""Bread Alone"" so I was excited to read this sequel. Unfortunately, this book does not measure up to the first. The plot is so all over the place it seemed like the author just went with anything that popped into her head. Several main themes of the first book are abandoned for less interesting topics and the story just weaves aimlessly between characters.The worst aspect of this novel is that NONE of the issues are resolved in the end...it just fades out to a completely unsatisfying conclusion that leaves the reader just hanging in the air.DISAPPOINTING!"
3,The Baker's Apprentice,I was hoping for another Bread Alone and sorry it wasn't. I did finish it and enjoyed the read but was hoping for more. But I still remain a Judity R. Hendricks fan.
3,Sequel to 'Bread Alone',This book wasn't as good as the first one but had it's moments. I'll still keep it to continue the story.
4,The Baker's Apprentice,"Unlike Bread Alone, I found this book to be the better of the two. Wyn Morrison has grown past that annoying complainer from the first book and into a mature, intelligent, strong woman. I thought this story was great. I enjoyed these characters very much. I am new to Judith Ryan Hendricks but will continue to follow her work."
4,Nice basic figure,"Not a bad figure, I like the look and the stabilized gun mount (obviously modeled on a stabilized camera) is interesting. Now, it definitely is one of the old style figures, very little articulation and not the same load of accessories you would like. That being said, it is reasonably durable, the only thing that went wrong after a great deal of use from my younger brother who I bought it for was that the waist started spinning rather to easily."
4,Wonderful model,"Watch it when you buy bridles for it though, it's hard to get one that adjusts enough to fit the throat, due to the tipped head. I simply love this model, it's beautiful"
5,It's GREAT,"Okay, about these review. If you EVER get someone telling you it randomly breaks that is only because you pulled the plug. If you attach this lamp to a outlet extention plug, then this will not burst/break/whatever you call it. My turtle has some calcium deficiency and ever since I got this, they have been doing GREAT!Positive:My turtles LOVE itIt works very well!Improve the health of your reptileVery good qualityLasts for 6 months - 1 yearNegative:VERY Expensive (but worth it! The best out there!!)"
1,Important Flaw - it shuts off!,"Bought this to boost the temps in a 20 gallon tank for my carpet python with a respiratory infection. My goal, per the vet is low to mid 90's. I assumed I was reaching those temps until I noticed the thermostat was calling for heat, but the bulb was off... it shuts off somewhere in the md 80's. This is inexcusable for a reptile heat lamp. I've grown accustomed to the terrible quality products provided to herp keepers, but for the price, this really is not acceptable."
1,Burnt out after 2 months,"Should have listened to the other reviews, but I thought I might get a ""good"" one. No such luck, the first one of these lasted a little over 2 months before it burnt out. This is in a rigid ceramic fixure that was never moved, on 10 hours per day on a timer, so it's not careless handling to blame.This is really unacceptable in a 40 dollar plus bulb. Unfortunately, there appears to be little choice at the moment. My favorite ""mega-rays"" are impossible to get right now.One star. I'd give it zero if I could."
2,Just bad,One of the worst MVB on the market. The only thing that was good about it was that it gave off enough heat as well as UV.
1,Keep looking,The first one I ordered arrived broken and the second quit working after one day. Ended up with a fluorescent type. Nice idea but way too problematic.
1,Does not last...,"I purchased this lamp and put it in a deep dome, vented, ceramic socketed hood. The bulb lasted about 12 hours. This was plugged directly into the wall outlet. I got a replacement lamp from Amazon shortly after. This was put in the same hood, same location etc. This one lasted about 7 weeks with about 9 hours daily use.For the money this life expectancy is horrible.The lamp is parallel to the floor, not tilted or anything odd. The lamp is not touching anything, does not get misted or even breathed on yet the life is so short. I do not have any thing between it and the power source.I really was hoping for a good lamp/brand here."
1,Burned up in a week,"I decided to give this bulb a chance, even though it has mixed reviews due to its questionably short life. This thing burned up within a week. Another bulb, not exactly sure what brand it is, has been working for the passed six months. I'm definitely not buying another one of these things."
5,I use this bulb for all of my bearded dragons,It does a good job at keeping the basking temps between 90 to 100 degrees which is where you want to be at. It provides them UVB as well.
1,Not a good bulb,"This bulb puts out heat, like it should for a basking bulb, however, after setting this bulb up (yes, I followed the directions on the minimum and maximum distance) my bearded dragon started refusing to bask. I checked the heat of the basking area and changed the distance so it maintained a temperature of 102 degrees fahrenheit (the vet said it needed to be between 100-105 degrees with him preferring to be between 105-110). After 3 months, the first bulb simply quit working. I sent it back and after about a month without a bulb I received a replacement from the company. I have had the replacement for about 3 months and it has quit working like the last one. I will not be re-purchasing this bulb in the future and I do not recommend it. My beardie hates it and it is definitely not worth the price."
1,Zoo med Powersun UV Mercury Vapor Lamp sucks!!!,"I bought this UV bulb at the beginning of September from Amazon. Don't get me wrong the delivery was awesome, but the product stink! I didn't use the UV light until October 3, 2011 when I got my bearded dragon. It continued to work for exactly 1 month before it made a loud popping noise and never came back on again. Unfortunately I could not find the box or anything else proving when and where a purchased the bulb. So, that same day, November 3, 2011, I went to Pet Smart And told one of the cashiers about the issue and he told me that the dome that I had was wrong. Not only did I have to buy a brand new UV light but I bought an ""appropriate"" dome as well. When I got up this Morning (January 7, 2011) to turn my dragon's light on, it came on and went right off... I think it is safe to say that Zoo Med Powersun UV Mercury Vapor Lamp 100 Watts is a terrible waste of money."
1,Both bulbs only lasted a month,"This is for my tortoise table, fixed onto a zoomed mini deep dome fixture. It stopped working after one month.I bought a second bulb, taking the precaution this time to plug it into a surge protector to prevent surges from blowing the bulb out.Blew again after barely a month use!I am looking to buy another brand, these bulbs should last much longer. It is not worth the trouble to replace them each time it happens."
1,burnt out in 2 weeks,"Title says it all. Worked great, until it burnt out in about two weeks. Never again. Do yourself a favor and get one that actually lasts"
1,Waste of money,"Bought 2 of these (bearded dragon and russian tortoise). One lasted about 2 hours and the other one appears to be having issues as well. Made sure I spent the money on the deep dome LF-17 with ceramic socket after reading the warnings so the fixture did not damage these expensive bulbs. $6 Walmart clamp light with a $4 spot light worked with no problems, just lacked UVB so upgraded to this expensive bulb. Hoping the Zoo Med return process is not too much of a hassle."
2,keep trying but he hates it,after a week my bearded dragon would not open his eyes. the closes point to the light was 10 inchs but he never got within 15 inchs of the light. mabe it was just to bright i dont know. but went back to my old light a he went back to opening his eyes. gave it a week and tryed the light again( cost 50 bucks wanted to make sure it was the light) did the same thing. bearded dragon is about a year old alway ate great not big on greens but eats some. after going back to the old light went back to normal in a day or two this was the 100w.
1,Very disappointed! Lightbulb only lasted one week.,"Received light and for the first week it was wonderful. Our tortoise loved to bask underneath it. Today I went to turn it on and it flickered out. Very disappointed. The lightbulb states 6000 hours, ours did not even last 70!"
1,Lasted for only 129 days,"We bought it on Sept 18, 2011 and it died today (Jan 25, 2012). We had it on a standard timer set for about 14 hours a day."
2,barely gave off heat!!,"I couldnt get a TRex 100W flood so i thought i'd give this bulb a chance and i was totally not satisfied. Only 13"" from my tortoise, the Zoo Med bulb was only giving off 75 degrees of heat.Within 2 weeks i had replaced it with the TRex which gives off 95 degrees of heat at the same distance and has a longer output of UVB."
3,Did not last a year!,I purchased this lamp on 1/24/12 and it has been working fine until today. The lamp only lasted 8 months! It's still under a one year warranty tho. I called Zoo Med and they told me to return it and they will replace it.
1,Bad,Like others have stated only lasted one month before burning out. I even wore latex gloves when handling the bulb thinking maybe it was oil on the glass causing other peoples problems with premature burnout. Oh well looks like its time to make a warranty claim.
4,This product is pretty good,"I used this for a while over top of my CWD's terrarium and he seemed to love basking underneath it, at the moment i am using two 5.0 bulbs and two 2.0's over top of him in an exo terra four bulb hood.My use for this bulb now having only used it for about 2 and 1/2 months is for play time with my dragons.I let them out in my room and have the Powersun in a deep dome which can be hung from just about anywhere in my room.I know that my dragons do not need to be sucking up uv all day like vampires but just for extended amounts of time when they are outside of their terrariums i visually notice them run right up my fake trees to go get beamed by the powersun."
5,The Proud Family,"I really enjoyed this CD because it is upbeat and makes you feel good with familar favorites like "" Respect"" by Aretha Franklin, ""Use to Be My Girl"" by The O' Jays and other toe tapping songs like ""Peanut Butter Jelly Time"" by Buckwheat Boys and ""Enjoy Yourself"" by L.P.D.Z. This CD will get your body up and moving. There is something for everyone on this various artists CD."
2,Proud Family,"Basically I bought this CD primarly for the song ""peanut butter jelly time"" a crazy silly song that just seams to grow on you, because it's just that crazy and silly. Has a couple of other good songs on it."
3,"Good size, but quality isn't all that great","It's particle board and shipping caused some cracking of the pieces - since appearance isn't critical for this (it's holding paper!), it wasn't worth returning. However, the cost to quality ratio isn't very high. Since cardboard versions of this go for $80 and only hold 20, we went with this one thinking it would last longer. We'll see if that's the case."
3,informative but boreing....,"I have read the book and watched bith videos. IMO I found myself getting rather bored with Sallys voice at times. I have ridden western for years and English for 12 months. I take a lesson twice a week from a professional and train daily 4-5 hours a day in Dressage. The only thng I gathered from the book and videos was ""soft Eyes.... belt buckel being pulled forward and the wing-ged (hoe she pronounced it) victory).... A better book and video is the 40 Fundamentals of Riding.40 Fundamentals of English Riding: Essential Lessons in Riding Right (Book & DVD)[...]"
5,Centered Riding Brings a New Level to Riding,"My instructor recommended this book a few years ago and it has changed the way I ride and how I look at riding. I come from a hunter/jumper background but I think the ideas could apply to all types of riding. The hot horses go softer with these techniques and the quiet horses become more responsive. This book helps bring the rider's mind into the sport through exercises and diagrams that show new perspectives. Her second book is also excellent. This is one of my favorite books on riding, especially since I also practice yoga and martial arts."
4,Useful old favorite,"This book has been in print for a considerable length of time - and for good reason. Sally Swift has a knack of generating useful mental models that help the learner rider grasp the elusive essentials. Riding is full of concepts that are difficult to convey to novices. It's rather like learning to ride a bike or swim - once you can do it you can't see what all the fuss was about.Sally Swift's book should prove a useful adjunct to other instruction - whether had from an instructor or gained from books like those of Cherry Hill. The book, as its name implies, deals with the basics. In essence it aims to help you establish a ""deep seat"" and a ""long leg"" - the two basic requirements for more advanced instruction yet things that prove surprisingly difficult for most people to achieve.I would rate this book a ""good buy"" rather than a ""must buy""."
5,A great start for a newbie,Although for me this book has to digested in small amounts then applied. The process is enjoyable. I am a late comer to riding and coming from training dogs horses are different.I am going to also purchase the DVDs the book was suggested by a riding instructor who was not aware that DVDs were also available.Since I have back issues this method will help me to position correctly making the ride more enjoyable for both myself and the horse
3,Basic information,This was recommended and a good basic book. I already kne most of the information. Would be helpful to a new rider.
5,phenomenal book,sally swift is brilliant. swift's insight into visualizing images while riding takes riders to new understanding and plateau in riding.
1,Entirely useless,"Having heard so much about this great, breakthrough book, I was really disappointed. The approach to riding was certainly unusual, but I found none of the images helpful in any way, and in fact if you follow her images closely, you will end up riding incorrectly, as is apparent by the incorrect position seen in many of the pictures throughout the book. She falls into the common trap of thinking riding is about relaxing and balancing, rather than a highly athletic endeavor that requires strong isotonic contractions of many muscles, primarily the abs and thigh muscles."
2,The title says it all.,"And I mean all. I got very little out of this book. I needed more practical descriptions rather than ""center yourself,"" ""breathe,"" ""let your arms be one with the reins,"" etc. Visualization and airy-fairy language is not enough. ""Like"" this book must have sprung from the 70s hippy era."
4,Descriptive but hardly practical,"This book explains balanced riding through imagery and visualization. I think it may be handy for the novice rider, but there are many better books for the more experienced rider. It only goes as far as Novice or Elementary level dressage and covers some jumping techniques. It's a book about the basics to help build some foundations, but if you already know your foundations, then find another book. There are also lots of helpful illustrations and b/w photographs to back up the explanations. If you are a novice or you have specific riding problems, you will find this book quite handy. Even if you are experienced, you could find a few useful tips - but don't expect more. I also feel it's a little outdated."
5,Centered Riding by Sally Swift,Book is excellent for helping one understand the importance of their body posture to assist the horse when riding as well as developing a secure seat for trail or arena riding.It is a wonderful wealth of information for riders and horse lovers of all levels.
3,Interesting read,"I enjoyed what this book was trying to do, but I'm uncertain if the information here is current and/or correct. Some of the first aid advice I question having just taken first aid courses, and gotten conflicting info. Still, for the $4 I paid for it, you can't go wrong."
1,Useless and Poorly Written,"I ordered this book as I really thought it might have some fun information about woodsmanship or old ways of doing things. Not expecting practical items but at least material that was researched and had some credibility. Boy was I wrong. Not only is a lot of the data in this book WRONG, but some of it is downright dangerous. About the only use I will have for this book is to level out a wobbly table or maybe to start a fire using the paper. Save your money.The title had hooked me. I'll save you the trouble. To ""Catch a Pig"", use a covered pit that is baited and be careful extracting the pig. There you have it, the basis for the entire title is one sentence.Oh yeah, I would have given it ""0"" stars, but thats not an option."
2,Historical Lessons of Marginal Practical Value,"When I purchased this book, I went in with my eyes open knowing that it is a collection of campfire stories and old ""best way"" methods. I had hoped, though, that I would gain a little insight into some practical tips and suggestions for today's nature enthusiast. And though there were some, there were very few. The redundancy and laughable suggestions (use a 8'- 10' fishing pole for pike; the best fishing poles are bamboo) eroded the practical application of the remaining insights. So if you're looking for a lesson in firearms (35% of content) or entertainment of how things used to be done before technology entered the outdoor world, the book has real value. If you're looking for tips and suggestions on how to survive in the bush or to support a true roughing-it camping experience, look elsewhere."
4,Very good,I purchased it for my husband as a Christmas gift. He has really enjoyed it as has everyone else that has checked it out.
3,Inconsistent perfomance,"This is a great bulb for your reptile, if it works. The bulb I purchased behaved erratically almost immediately, randomly turning off and on, and lasted about 5 months before failing entirely.As per the warranty in the box, I returned it to the company for a replacement. The replacement bulb only lasted about 3 months. sigh."
1,Burned out in less than 3 months,"I bought this bulb 7/22/2011. It has burned out on 10/17/2011. It didn't even last 3 mos. For the price, you'd think you'd get more than a couple month's use out of it. Now I have to buy another one."
3,UVA/UVB lamp,"I really liked how this lamp gives out UVA, UVB and heat, so i got it for my bearded dragon. Only problem is, the light turns off at least once a day (I have it on for 12 hours, and at least once in the 12 hours it randomly turns off). I've tried plugging it into many outlets in my room and it's done it every where i've plugged it into. I paid so much for it, and it won't even stay on."
2,Mediocre Lamp,"This is a good lamp, but lasts like no time at all. The package says 10,000 hours, which theoretically, if you used the lamp 10-12 hours a day, then the lamp should last at least for 800-1000 days. In reality, it lasted like 3 months. It's OK, and suitable for my pair of bearded dragons, but is very expensive, and has very little life.Kinda sucky. Way overpriced."
1,Bulb burns out,The bulb burned out after 4-5 months. It has a year warranty so I paid $14 to send it back for a replacement. After 2 months now the replacement has burned out as well. Company wants me to pay another $14to send it back for another replacement bulb until the one year expires in May 2012.We paid $80 for the first one and you have to deal with the manufacturer for warranty claims.
4,No problems. Lasted beyond warranty period,We got this lamp just over a year ago and it just burnt out. It exceeded their 1 year warranty. The lamp was used 8 hours per day and gave no trouble whatsoever
2,Really?,I ordered this bulb for my Mali Uromastix three months ago. I ignored the bad reviews of it and ordered anyways. It has a warranty but I didn't register it. Bad decision. Now I'm having to buy another. It just stopped working for no reason. I will be sure to get the warranty this time.
2,Disappointing,"Maybe my hopes for this product were too high, but I was let down by these peppermint capsules.I didn't have any trouble with them dissolving too early and causing the weird stomach cooling that I read about in the cases of others, but I also didn't find any relief from my predictable IBS symptoms. I tried taking them at various times during the day, and in higher doses, but it was no use.Of course, the fact remains that there are very good reviews for this product out there-- clearly peppermint oil capsules can work for some. Just not me, unfortunately."
5,What a miracle!,I have suffered from IBS with diahhrea forna long time . The omly thing that has helped memthus far is drinking metamucil each day. If i skipped a day it was a disaster. There is nothin worse than hitting a department store and having to run to he bathroom. I purchased Heathers peppermint oil capsules after seeing an episode of Dr. Oz. He was not proposing a certain brand of peppermint oil but be said that peppermint oil in enteric capsules would significantly help IBS with diahhrea. The oil has to be in an enteric capsule to prevent digestion of the oil in he stomach . I take one capsule 15 minutes before coffee in fhe morning along witb the metamucil an hour later. He combo of the two has changed my life. No more rushing to the toilet or accidents
2,Not Good For IBS-C,I struggle with IBS-C and have tried many different products to help with the symptoms - without much luck. I tried these pills and so far I haven't noticed any difference in helping with my IBS-C. I get terrible peppermint burps from this product. It hasn't worked for me but perhaps it might be different with everyone else.
2,No real results for me,I tried these before trying the tummy fibers. I didn't see any noticeable improvement in the intestinal cramping I was experiencing for a prolonged time. I switched to the Tummy Fibers and had much better results.
1,Not for me,"This product will ease stomach distress for most people. However, for some of us with GERD, it will actually make the symptoms worse. So I won't be using it any longer, but let your own body be your guide."
1,No effect,"Used it pretty regularly. It's too strong and kept burping it although I have no problems with acid reflux, took it more for IBS like symptoms. No changes seen, no symptoms relieved."
4,Peppermint Oil Capsules,"These capsules seem to mitigate some of the symptoms due to IBS. I found I could tolerate them well, by taking one daily, at least 15 minutes before food. When I stopped taking them, my symptoms ( gas, etc.) recurred. However, this product doesn't completely eradicate them, and better results are obtained when probiotics are added to the regimen."
4,good for digestive problems,"This product does cut down on gas and bloating. I take it before meals and it does wonders. Be sure to drink it with cold (not hot or warm) water to wash it down. If you don't, you may experience some peppermint reflux. I like this formulation better than the one she had used many years ago. The product performs like it says it does. I recommend it highly."
5,Worked wonders for my IBS,"Gas pain and cramping virtually gone after I started taking the Peppermint Oil Capsules (and only 1 per day). I experience a tiny bit of reflux/heartburn in the hour after taking the capsule, but it is minimal and well worth it for the benefit to the colon."
1,didn't work,"These didn't work for me at all. I never have reflux but these gave me some reflux the first time I took them. Also, they worked as a laxative which I don't need. They did relax my colon but at the laxative cost, I'll pass. I'm glad they work for most, just not for me."
2,may or may not help,"used product for about a month, saw no noticeable changes in my sometimes irritable bowel like symptoms. not sure if it does anything."
5,Fresh breath!,"I don't have IBS or any other issues like that. I tried these because I read somewhere that peppermint oil helped you not have to fart. I was planning a trip with a relatively new boyfriend and I just thought, why not? Well, I don't know if they had that effect. It wasn't really an issue and I don't know if it would have been. BUT, when he rolled over and kissed me good morning, he asked ""when did you brush your teeth?"" I hadn't. I had the same creepy mouth feeling that he probably did. But apparently the peppermint was working from within. I didn't taste it...but what an uber cool thing to have him think I was naturally minty fresh.That was a couple of years ago and we both stopped caring who farted or who didn't and now we are just amazing friends. However, I still use these pills. Nothing worse than having stank breath and not knowing it. This is a healthy alternative to swamp mouth."
5,a good medicated food for IBS,"The product is satisfactory for me and helps me to relieve to a large extent the pain caused by an attack of IBS and tremendously shortens the duration of such attack. As I do not have the problem of gas reflux, I do not have strong feeling of the reflux of the peppermint oils, just a little sensation of the presence of peppermint in my mouth or stomach occasionally after taking the pills, which is quite acceptable for me. The effect of the pills is even more satisfactory than taking my existing prescribed IBS medication. Of course, we have to be careful with what we eat and make sure we have no problem with the digestion of the food we eat because indigestion or overeating are the major causes of attack for me and for other IBS sufferers too."
2,Needs better enteric coating,"These work well at reducing symptoms and soothing intestinal discomfort and urgency - however, they could be better.The enteric coating is a bit thin, leading it to often dissolve in your stomach before it reaches your intestines.This can cause reflux like symptoms, nausea, a 'cold' feeling in your stomach, and peppermint burps.Pepogestworks a lot better for me - despite it lacking ginger and fennel.The pepogest is easier on the stomach, and results in the same, if not better, soothing."
4,PEPPERMINT TABS,THESE REALLY HELP WITH IBS SYMPTOMS WHEN TAKEN FIRST THING IN THE MORNING ALONG WITH PEPPERMINT TEA. GREAT FOR IBS SUFFERERS
1,Doesn't work...,"Bought these expecting them to work better than the regular peppermint oil capsules out there, but they don't work at all! Pepogest is far better than these and is more readily available."
2,Enteric coating does not work,"Immediately after taking these I always get reflux. Also, the seem to trigger the very symptoms I am taking them to avoid, as well.So, they are not for everyone. Maybe people who don't have reflux get better results."
3,not sure about this,"I tried this during a few IBS outbursts and although it probably helped a bit, it was not miraculous. What truely helped was the acacia powder, sometimes I think it will make my IBS go away :)"
3,Peppermint oil capsules,It does help me somewhat. Had hoped for more but will continue to use them to see if things do get better.
1,Not for me!,"I can't see how this product is enteric coated because if that were the case, the pill wouldn't open up untilit reached the lower part of the digestive system and it seems to start working in the upper digestivesystem way too quickly. It gave me reflux.I would have to say to be really careful if you have reflux and generally I don't, but I was feeling a burning sensation in my chest after one pill.It also doesn't make a lot of sense to be taking this on an empty stomach. I would think if I had taken itin the middle of a meal, it might have gone down with my food and arrived at it's destination as it should.Trouble was I was scared to take another pill because of the burning in my chest. It took hours to go awayand made me wonder what Heather was thinking in the design of this product!"
1,I'm sad that this doesn't work.,"I have tried Beano and other products to help stop the ""expenditure of gas"" from my body. Nothing works. Then I heard about the peppermint oil pills and, again, got my hopes up. Well, these pills do not work either. I am so dissappointed. I was so sure they would work, I even purchased two bottles. I guess I'll keep looking for something to help. (One thing is that I wish the pills wouldn't have to be taken on a completely empty stomach, and that they must be taken about an hour prior to eating.)"
1,NO GO,"ibs c / fibro patient here. im not feeling this product at all.. sorry try maybe if i had ibs d. but this did not do much.. what goes in must come out... and it did in a spicy way when u go to the restroom. this product did not take care of bloating, or anything for my ibs sorry. dont buy too much."
1,ibs c fibro sufferer.,this is a no go if u do want to try try the one bottle first dont pay for 2. i have ibsc this stuff BURNS when it comes out. also i burped up peppermint?? weird huh. i must say maybe if i had ibs d it would be different. peace.
3,Almost there,Did not take a major portion of the cast to the show. What was their was good ( except for Lawery who is wearing kind of thin) just not enough. It was more the Vocal Band.
1,LOST Ward Bond,"I also remember growing up sitting in my Fathers lap, and watching Wagon Train, and I fell in love with Ward Bond he just Makes the show!! I still am thinking on buying the Wagon Train or not. I personally can't even think of watching it with out the number 1 man in it!! Sorry Still Thinking!!!!"
2,OK NOW FOR THE FACTS,"I've been a DoA diehard for years so i am not against the group but this CD sums up what is most appalling and criminal about the record industry.Basically, they have taken 8 of their best songs and ""remixed"" them in an edited form !! The result is that you have a CD capable of storing 80 minutes of music, that barely lasts 35 mins as they are all edited 7"" versions.I can't understand that amongst all the reviews here, no-one has bothered to mention this because i think it is crucial...the very title of the album ""rip it up"" suggests an extended cd compilation.As for non-stop dance mix, it isn't , it's simply been passed through a nero editor to eliminate the 2 second pause between the tracks, nothing else.Bitterly disappointing, would it really have cost them to compile the full versions ?Dead Or Alive deserve a better tribute than this offering."
4,That hot chick on the front cover is hot! Wowwwwweeee,"Ohhhhh Boyyyyyyyyy What a tasty cd! I called all my buddies (Horn, Sweats, Adam, Barral, G-man, Trout, D-Boy, Gooch, Marble, and a bunch of squirrely college babes ) and had an ""I want Surprizes"" party. These songs get me in the mood to sing with 2 rockin guitar players/dancers by my side. If you want a cookin beat with a twist of Relaxation, this CD is a must for you! The female lead singer is mega cute, but I can't understand the flat chest."
2,Get the import version with the bonus track,"The Import version of this CD can be gotten pretty inexpensively from amazon marketplace, and what makes it a gem for Dead or Alive collectors is that, as a bonus track, it has the full length 12"" version of ""Turn Around and Count to Ten"". It stands completely alone and is not continuously mixed with the rest of these chopped up edits. As of this writing, that is the ONLY place you can get the full 12"" version of that song on CD, and it pushes this mere 35 minute disc closer to 45 minutes. I just wish they had added a bunch more 12"" versions as bonus tracks to bring up the CD duration."
2,Not required. Oh no SONY!,"Epic, whatever! This LP just isn't necessary. Don't waste your time. This LP is an afront to my musical soul. Pete Burns would agree, just nothing. Put your $$$ on ""Nude"" instead of this rubbish. What a shame."
2,Painful to listen to,"Ouch. This really hurts. Dead or Alive could have released their greatest hits as a CD single, and saved a bunch of album space.Yeah, ""You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)"" is a great track. ""Brand New Lover"" has an incredibly catchy vocal hook, the kind that can get stuck in the head for days on end. The final two tracks, ""In Too Deep"" and ""Hooked on Love"" are passable...barely. The rest of the album sounds like overdone synthesizer noodling and screechy dancefloor gimmicks. The songs aren't particularly memorable, and, as a result of the overdone productions and general musical messing around, not even really fun to dance to.Unless you loved their albums in the '80s, and Dead or Alive is a proven quantity to you, don't bother with this."
3,AVERAGE GAY BAR DANCE STUFF,"Must've been an early curfew. Just when they seem to start screamin', they run out of venom. Too bad. I'd like to hear the UNabrdiged versions. They die quickly. (No pun intended.)"
3,Nice work,"I f you like Black Sabbath and Ozzy you will probably like this album (but not too much). My main problem is in the production . There is a lot of bass sound , that make me not like this album so much as i wound have with a better sound. The tracks are nice with no tracks to make the difference. The vocals are just ok (Its not like Ozzy guys) but i have to say that the guitar rocks."
2,Better stick to being a sideman,"I bought this version of the US release just to see what all the fuss was about. Sounds to me like ZW has been listening to alot of Alice in Chains, Pantera, and early Sabbath. Highly derivative. For the real deal, check out some Iced Earth."
3,my head was shaved.,"I found myself having to use the Adult Costume Wig when I awoke one morning in a European hostel and my head was shaved. Normally I would not mind but since I was leaving on a Russian tanker (tickets sold for passenger on Tankers and Passenger Ships) it would be offensive to have a bald head. Some of the tough sailors would take it as an offense so I steered clear and bought this at a costume shop. Suffice it to say it was not a pleasant experience. I awoke with fleas, lice and ticks."
2,Get Real,"I had to add my review when I saw the positive 5 start reviews for this album. I am a pretty true Priest fan and I've got the tattoos to prove it. When I bought this album, I was so excited that I went to the mall the day it came out and it NEVER lived up to the expectation. The songs are forced and silly. Even highpoints like ""Blood Red Skies"" fall flat due to the almost adolescent lyrical content.If you doubt me, go over the set lists for the tours that have followed this one and see how many songs they play from this album... I'll give you a hint, zero.Buy every single Priest recording, except this one.Long live Judas Priest."
4,(4.5 Stars) Very Underrated,"I don't see what the fuss is, this is an excellent priest album. All and all, I think this album is very good, by no way does it compare to Defenders of the faith, but the majority of the songs here rock! There's The title track, which has priest written all over it, and then there's ""Hard as Iron"" which will blow you away. Other tunes that are just killer would have to be ""Monsters Of Rock"" which is just dark and creepy, and kicks, and ""Heavy Metal"" which is a killer preview of what's next to come on Painkiller. Sadly, Priest only made one video from this album which was the Killer cover of Chuck Berry's ""Johnny B. Goode"", but I think that if they made a video to ""I'm A Rocker"", and ""Blood Red Skies"" this album would've taken off alot better. There's only one weak point, and that would be ""Love Zone"", which would be the only reason this album didn't get a full 5 stars."
2,UH-OH!,"I hate this album!! From the cliched song titles(""Love you toDeath"", ""I'm A Rocker"", ""Hard as Iron"",""Come and get it), to the overly simple,cliched lyrics, this album shows JP at their least intelligent.Also, the guitar playing is horrible! Technically, it may haverepresented Tipton and Downing at their best, but their guitarsolos were merely speed exercises! Their guitar solos used toactually SAY something!! Also, Halford was losing his knack atwriting melodic and catchy vocal lines. Side one is JP at theirworst and side two is only just a little bit better. I do havea few nice things to say about the album, however!First of all, the album cover may be their best ever! It's avery well drawn cover, to say the least! Secondly, ""Blood RedSkies"" is a very powerful song, especially when the drums comein! Also, ""I'm a Rocker"" is a very catchy hard rocker, with oneof the album's only memorable vocal lines!Other than that, RAM IT DOWN is a truly pathetic JP album!"
2,SMASH IT DOWN,"Buy this CD, then you'll smash it into the ground due to anger !! Very bad. This was the last record with Dave Holland on drums. Glenn and K.K. are playing better than never, but the songs are silly. Exception: the cover of Johnny Be Goode sounded amazing and the solo in the title track is something that belongs to the history of metal !"
4,Defender of RAM IT DOWN,"Oh come on now . . does anyone listen to JP for the lyrics, really? Most of the lyrics on most JP albums are cliched and formulaic. In my humble opinion, this album is second only to Painkiller. A real headbanger. Buy it."
2,The end of the road for me...,"I used to be a big Priest fan in jr. high and high school (graduated '87), but this album didn't impress me at all. When ""Turbo"" came out, I was saddened, and this album, although harder, didn't help much and was the last 'Priest album I purchased.On the flip side, when I saw Judas Priest in concert in 1988 (just after this album came out),the songs they played from ""Ram"" sounded awesome! In my opinion, the band was just meant to be appreciated live."
2,One or two good songs,"I have to agree with the music fan from canada, they have only two songs on this album that I care to listen to. Very unlike Priest."
5,"One of the best by the""Preist"".",The rendition of Johnny B. Good is fantastic.The Preist still rocks.Upstate Ne
2,Forgettable and Disappointing,"Every great band has a weak point or two and ""Ram it Down"" is Priest's. It's without a doubt the most forgettable and uninspired Priest album to be released. To me, it seemed that the band's collective fuel tank is pretty much on EMPTY for this one. Yes, the album has a few high points and the muscianship is its usual brilliance. Rob Halford's wake-the-dead wail is there. The composition and arrangements are OK. But the album is missing Priest's greatest strength: and that is the sense of rebellion, energy and edginess that just propelled earlier LP's. Without that energy, ""Ram it Down"" sounds just plain silly in most cases and difficult to take even a little seriously. About the only thing ""Ram it Down"" can do -- with tunes like ""Hard as Iron"", ""I'm a Rocker"", ""Come and Get it"" and ""Love Zone"" -- is make a fan truly appreciate their other material."
3,Not As Bad As Everyone Says!,"I was in 10th grade when this album came out. I remember the first time I listened to this and being slightly disappointed. I just found a used copy for [amt], so I said what the heck! I'm still a little bummed about this album, but it's not as bad as I remembered it to be. The first two songs rock! Blood Red Skies rules, and Johnny B. Goode is one of the most pathetic cover songs from one of the most pathetic movies ever!! Johnny B. Goode - Starring, Anthony Michael Hall (If you can believe it!), Uma Thurman,& Robert Downey Jr. (Who is probably more disgraced by this film than all his off screen problems!) Bottom line - this album hasn't stood the test of time, but it isn't as bad as people say."
2,"NOT SO BAD AS EVERYBODY SAYS, BUT NOT SO GOOD EITHER ...","RAM IT DOWN is a big dissapointment, no matter how you look at it. None of its songs are present in Priest's live set. The most annoying thing, in my opinion, are the drums. Maybe that's why Dave Holland left. Other than this, the lyrics are weak ( a now common factor for Priest, unfortunately). As for the musical merits of the album, we have the following: great guitar solos, Blood Red Skies."
2,"Disappointing, overly biased read","I had to read this book for a Worldview class at Dallas Baptist University. The goal of my class was supposedly for me to establish my worldview and develop an understanding around my reasons for believing as I do. I would have enjoyed the book much more if Sire had attempted to truly take an unbiased look at other worldviews. The tone is almost always preachy and arrogant against all views except Theism. It's no surprise to anyone with half a brain which worldview he subscribes to (hint...it's the one he doesn't make weak, circular arguments about and attempt to drag through the mud). I don't know if I'm more disappointed in the book or in my school for making me read this with the supposed intention of understanding my belief system. I found this book to be a waste of time and no help at all to anyone who really wants to examine their worldview. If you are a Christian looking for someone to validate you in a half-baked manner, this is the book for you."
5,"Great book, great price.","Good book, and this saved me a lot of money. I am very happy with this purchase and the book was in great shape."
5,great book,this was a great book. it was very insightful. the author did a great job of defining and describng the most prominent worldviews held in todays world.
5,An excellent introduction to worldviews.,"Mr.Sire's book is exactly what it claims to be; a basic worldview catalog. It is well written and covers its topic nicely. His points are not always fully fleshed out, but that is expected for a brief work on such a broad topic. If interested, one should take Mr. Sire's advice and dig deeper into the subject."
2,Disappointing,"Picking up this book in the philosophy section of a bookstore, I was excited to see a book that would summarize several worldviews in order to begin my own trek into philosophy. I was encouraged by the author's introduction, promising ""to suggest [each worldview's] strengths and weaknesses."" Unfortunately, this book failed to live up to my expectations. Theism only gets a thumbs up, and no weakness are admitted in that ""complete worldview"". Each and every other one is portrayed as having no truth whatsoever; he concedes no truth to any of the others. I am currently in process of getting a refund for this book."
2,Obviously One-Sided,"If you are a Christian (in the Western tradition) and you want to reinforce what you already believe, by all means get this book and be happily naive. This will supply you with trite arguments against misrepresented belief systems that you can use to witness to unbelievers. (Atheism is wrong because it says there is no God- You can use the author's tactics against montheism.) However, if like me, you are disenchanted with contemporary Christianity and want to seriously explore/understand other worldviews, this is not for you. I give it two stars because the author was open about his bias."
5,I wish more people would read this book !!!,"This is a great book.I've read the older edition in russian, and then I bought the new one (that includes Postmodernism), but didn't read it yet. However, this is a great book and James Sire is the good man (because he did good decent research). I wish more people would read it and see how inconsistent some worldviews are...If you liked this book read more from the same author AND try ""Understanding the times"" by David Noebel. They have new edition on their website (Amazon doesn't have it yet) - at Summit Ministries.~thanks~"
3,Unfair at times,"To me, Sire spent too much time trying to interpret worldviews rather than letting them speak for themselves. He is an intellectual, which is nice, but his generalizations felt a bit too prevalent. I would recommend something by Ravi Zacharias if you're looking for a less in-your-face approach to worldviews presented by a Christian author. I hope he revises this book and tones down the rhetoric, as it does contain some redeeming material."
2,For people with minds are already made up.,"This book presents itself as a ""basic worldview catalog."" While it does cover many of the major themes it is heavily tainted by the authors inability to see things from anything but a Christian perspective.A quote from the end of the book says it all in my mind: ""In terms of possible worldviews, our options are numerous but, as we have seen, limited. Of those we have investigated, all but theism were found to have serious flaws.""While no worldview is perfect, to not see the flaws in theism requires a very blinkered view of the world and this shows its self again and again through the book.If you want to read something that tells you why Christianity is the best worldview there is - go ahead and buy it. If you want something more objective I would look elsewhere."
5,Great book. condition as advertised and fast shipping,"If you like british political comedies and subtle humour, this book is for you. Book condition was as advertised and shipping was fast. Very satisfied with the order."
5,Quick Delivery - made life much easier once I had it here !,Very quick delivery - package showed up in great shape and I was thrilled to have my remote for the garage back again !!
5,Fully Satisfied,"My order arrived 2 days earlier than due date. Everything works. Instructions to program the remotes were as easy as counting 1-2-3. Definitely , I will order again from this vendor."
4,"Apparently does not have the ""duplicate"" or ""match"" feature of the 972LM","Surprisingly, this remote is less capable than the 972LM.Yes, the remote will work for your orange learn button garage door, but be wary if you want to match another remote for your community/commercial gate.You would think this (973LM) would just be a three-button version of the 972LM, and would have all of the 972LM's capabilities. However, it does not. The manual for the 972LM specifically has instructions for a match/duplicate feature. This remote (973LM) does not appear to have the match feature and this unit's (973LM) manual is silent on the matter. Even apart and aside from the match feature, my HOA was not able to get this remote to work with the community gate (while the 972LM does)."
5,Perfect and early arrival,"This was exactly what I needed and it arrived early. It was exactly as advertised, programmable and replaced my lost remote."
4,rewrite review for liftmaster 3 button remote,"I accidently received the wrong remote, but the company was very helpful in sending the right one and sending me a postage free return slip for the wrong item. I would like to thank them very much. I just got the right one yesterday but have not the time to program it. the other one i have is in the car, I wanted to replace an old one I had for the truck. All is swell now. They work really good."
2,"OK for replacement, not for additional remote, does not work on many craftsman openers","I bought this for $18 shipped, and I'm sure it would work great for a lot of people. Quality is fine, workmanship is fine, it was even delivered within 5 days.But...It does not have dip switches! That means you cannot clone another garage door opener remote! My garage door opener only allows for two unique remotes, but I need more than that as we have three cars and a motorcycle in the family and two workers need access to our garage as well. So, if you need/want dip switches, or to clone a remote, or you want several unique remotes, this is not for you.And...I gave it two stars because it stated it would work with purple craftsman programming button, but it did not. Also, paying for shipping to me an then paying return shipping would cost more than the unit costs (plus BS factor), so I am not returning this unit. If anyone wants my unit, message me."
2,after a few weeks they dont work,"you need to be rite in front of the door for them to work, thats the problem i had with the old ones but they lasted over ten years. poor prduct"
5,easy,Remote was easy to pair with new receiver and built-in controls in my van.I only need two buttons so I might set the third for my Bro-in-laws garage and do some drive -by openings on him.
5,Works Perfectly!,"What can be said for a garage door opener? It works perfectly, the instructions were clear and easy to understand, and it seems to be a well-made product."
2,Very short range,"This remote works only when the nose of my car is within five feet of the garage door AND I have the visor down. (The remote is attached to the visor, so putting the visor down allows the remote to transmit through the windshield rather than through the roof of the car.) I suppose the batteries could be old, but if they are, then that is another problem -- this product comes with built-in lithium batteries that are supposed to last five years and would be expensive to replace."
5,Less than one minute to get it to workl,"I bought two of these remotes to replace the two original Sears remotes I had. The old remotes just busted apart at the trigger switch. I put off buying any because I just did not want to deal with the hassle.Bought these and read the instructions and said, ""Yeah, right. No way is it this easy.""Set my stepladder up. Pressed the Learner button and immediately the light clicked. Then I pressed the button on the remote to accept the code and immediately it learned the code and opened the door. Less than 60 seconds to get the thing to work.Great set up. That is for sure."
5,Great product,The product works as described and is very easy to program. It took literally less than 10 seconds! Seller shipped the product quickly and arrived in about one week.
4,ok,it functions as expected lost the other two over the ppast few yrs and you annot go tohome depot and buy one.
5,Works fine-easy setup,This unit is a perfect replacement for my Sears opener with Orange Learn button. This orange buttonis located on the motor unit inside the right side light cover. There is a green LED near it. Mine was flashing.Thanks for the fast shipment.Now I need a safety receiver unit that was fried by lightning.(Door would start down- reverse and click angrily 10 times) -but would go up OK.)
3,"""Mixed"" Colors NOT Mixed...:(","I was disappointed by my last purchase. I buy these for my employees and ordered 3 boxes of 12 each of mixed colors. I received 35 orange ones and a white one. This company does not allow me to order the colors I really want, but of all the colors, orange is the worst!"
4,nice cutter,I don't know what I would do without these cutters. I use them everyday at work. Getting 12 for the price is great. They are also made pretty well.
4,random colors,"These box cutters are very nice and they are very sharp, the only problem is that they send you random colors. The picture shows a black, orange, and white one and when i got them there was no black or orange. I got 4 white, 4 red, and 4 yellow. So if you do purchase this then don't be surprised when you recieve 12 pink ones."
3,Cutter is great but scraper mode is poor,"This is a fairly standard design. The center doesn't pinch as much as I'd like, so the sheath can move around in the box a little.The scraper end isn't bowed out enough to be easy to install the razor blade.For what it is, it's a poor replica, but for what it competes with, it's still very good."
1,so badly made!,"Love the concept. In fact, I thought of this years ago and made one out of a small piece of sheet metal metal from the hardware store, and riveted handles onto it. Was very excited to see that there was a professional version, but it is so inredcibly thinly and cheaply made that it's extremely difficult to slice through the cake with, and as with the other reviewer, it broke on the second use. So I'm sticking with the one I made, but I'd be happy to buy a good-quality version of this."
3,Broken,"I love gadgets. This one in particular was quite cheaply made. By the second use, the handle fell off. Square one works better."
5,Super book for the period.,Great for history lovers and genealogists alike. This book give a very good description of the area and people and way of life.
5,excellant buy,"My husband and I are very impressed with the whole system. Interchangeability, ease of set up, and the quality of the product for the price."
1,missing parts,"Product was very scratched, all tripods/truss, like used, but more importantly, missing screw caps. American DJ said they would send some, never did."
2,damaged goods,The lighting stand as a whole is a good looking piece of equipment and works just fine. The problem I had was that the product came damaged. It wasn't just a couple of dings the two truss had big dents in them and the end which is supposed to go into one of the plastic holds was severely dented and I had to bend it back into place and force it into the hold because of the need for the stand. I wouldn't be upset if there was just scratches or maybe some minor dings but the dents were big
4,Awesome!,"This is a great worship CD... not only does it have some great songs with beat and rythm, but all are filled with meaningful content. It's worth the money."
1,great album,"Arriving is a wonderful album,its very inspirational and it lifts me up if I'm feeling a little down. I love to sing along to all the songs and I've gotten several friends listening to it also."
5,Awesome Christain Singer and CD!!!,This cd is superb and full of truth. Every song is a gift from God along with Chris Tomlin.I recommend this to everyone especially if you are seeking the Lord.Chris explains God's love and forgivness through song and shows God's ultimate authority through expert lyrics.This cd is definately God inspired.Give it a try.You won't regret it one bit.His music is very upbeat and will appeal to all.He sings from his heart which is not seen alot anymore nowadays.
5,Amazing Christian Rock,"I just got into Christian Rock, and have very few cds. In fact, I very rarely buy music cds. But this is an amazing cd, for any collection, be it Christian or regular rock. Chris has an amazing voice, great songs, and it makes you feel great listening."
5,Fantastic,Chris Tomlin is an awesome artist and every single song on this CD exemplifies that to the core. There isn't one song on this CD that is not absolutely wonderful to listen to. This is one of the best CDs I have!
4,Among the better artists I've found,"Chris Tomlin is among my favorite contemporary worship music writers. This CD has many worthwhile songs, and I'm sure most listeners will be pleased. Not quite ""5 stars"" because the lyrics could be more creative. Words like ""great"" and ""awesome"" to describe God appear, reappear, and reappear. In this way, the CD is not quite as mature as it could have been. However, this weakness is often offset by the other creative and worshipful aspects of this CD. (If you don't yet own ""Not To Us"" or ""The Noise We Make,"" I recommend these earlier releases slightly more.)"
4,Pleasantly Surprised,I am not huge worship music fan. It's too boring and plastic sounding. I was roped into attending a concert where Chris Tomlin performed. I admit I enjoyed the show but still didn't buy the CD. I just bought the CD on a whim 2 months ago and it has not left the CD player since. The music is really good. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of each song. There is enough 'churchy' sounding songs for those who like worship music but plenty enough of regular music songs for people like me too. I can't explain it very well but it is a favorite my entire family and that is not easily accomplished. Sorry for being so obtuse.
4,"Good, not great","I love the first four songs on this CD - especially ""How Great is Our God."" However, I have trouble distinguishing the remaining songs. Tomlin has a great voice, but I would've liked to hear some more versatility in the music.That said, the first four songs on the CD make it worth a purchase."
3,Very Small Size,"I didn't realize how small 0.13 oz was until I received it. It's smaller that a pack of gum. It does it's job though, stops bleeding on small cuts."
4,does what it's suppose to,"Stops bleeding from cuts, good little carrying tube with a resealable top. A little dab a d-tip will do the trick, should last for years, unless you shave with a machete..."
1,"Good product, rip off company","BEWARE!!! This item costs a little more then 2 dollars, yet the shipping is over 8 dollars! $2 product with $8 shipping!"
5,very fast pased and exciting,a very fast paced novel that i couldn't put down! I recommend this to any true crime fan!!
5,Wes Montgomery Hybrid/SACD,"The sound on this Hybrid/SACD release is amazing--you can hear every detail in the studio. My only complaint concerns tracks 6 and 8: these don't sound like alternate takes, but rather demos or run-throughs, as the sound quality is inferior to the other tracks. Too many labels are mining everything in the can and re-issuing CDs with bonus material that is often of little value. If included, it should be at the end of the orignal album, not scattered among the regular tracks."
1,LOUSY execution of product and frustrating to put together!,"My wife keeps buying Fisher-Price products for our infant. I don't know why. Most of the P.O.S. products we have bought from them have either malfunctioned prematurely, or have fallen short in expectations due to shoddy construction and/or poor design. This product is no exception. The concept is good, but execution is terrible. You will go crazy trying to find the tiny, recessed screws on the battery pack, in order to attach the unit to a crib. In addition, they easily strip, even with the proper sized screwdriver! This makes it impossible to either install the unit, or to remove it!!! Whoever designed the crib attachment battery pack part of this product should be fired Donald Trump style!!! Back to the drawing board Fisher-Price."
3,"It's loud, bulky, heavy and really not worth it!","I had registered for this item b/c someone had told me that their daughter loved this. I think it is just okay.The only positive thing about this is the music, it is nice and soothing.The negatives are that it is soooooooo heavy and bulky and a real pain to change the batteries. I never even attached this to my son's crib because of how heavy it is. I leave it on the floor and hit the blue button with my foot each night to start up the music while my baby is being put to sleep.The other negatives are that it very loud if you set it to the movement of the fish with it making bubbling sounds. It is so loud and mechanic sounding, I NEVER use it for that because it annoys me so much and my son doesn't find it to be too interesting anyway.This item is okay, but for the money it wasn't worth it to me because I only use it for the music part and that is all."
1,Battery Pack a Hassle!,"Like other reviewers, we had the original aquarium and our son loved it. We received the new one as a gift two years later and were excited UNTIL we took it out of the box and had to hassle with the battery pack. To make matters worse, the battery pack is so heavy that the connection will not stay, thus the music does not work. I was very disappointed in this model and ended up trashing it in less than two weeks. Did not have receipt or name of store purchased, or I would have returned it! Definitely would NOT recommend purchasing this one!"
2,"If you have the old one, you won't like this one","Our old ""fishy tank"" was 2.5 years old and has been through the ringer, so we decided to get the ""new improved"" version. I can see someone liking it if it is their first experience with it, but if you liked the old one, you'll hate this. The battery compartment is a pain, the sound of the animals going round and round is louder than the music (the old ones ""floated"" more gracefully) and the bubbles are really lame compared to the old one. I'm going to return this and get the old one again from amazon, because you can't find it in the stores! So sorry!!!"
4,Instant calmer,"I bought this toy for my 4 month old, thinking that ocean sounds could be soothing and help him go to sleep more easily. And it has been exactly as I hoped. When I put him down to sleep in his crib, he can be very restless at first. But as soon as I turn it on with the setting that has the bubbles, fish moving and music, he is instantly calm and mesmerized. He usually drifts off to sleep before the standard five minutes of playing are done. I agree with the other reviewers about how ridiculously difficult this was to install. I was ready to take it back. But now I am very glad I kept it. I've read from others that this uses a lot of batteries, but that has not been my experience so far and we use this frequently."
4,I have older model...sooo many batteries to replace,"I am afraid that I am writing this review too late. My review is in reference to previous model.Previous model went through batteries like crazy. (4 ""D"")Kid loves this thing. At 19 months the little one still enjoys it in her crib."
2,Load Motor,"I purchased this item yesterday, and it will go back to the store tomorrow. I got it together, turned it on, and the motor on the thing was louder than the music. It really does sound as though the motor is straining and it will break any minute. There is no way I will be able to tolerate the motor to put my baby to sleep."
3,"Baby loves this, but designers need to go back to the drawing board...","We are Americans living in Kuwait, and they do not have Fisher Price toys here :-(. We purchased this while on vacation in the U.S, because our five month old loves to watch aquarium fish. As a Fisher Price fan my entire life I have to say I was dismayed with the design of this toy. It is large, heavy, and clunky, and the battery pack installation was no fun at all; a real hassle even for us veterans with four children! On the plus side, our daughter loves to activate it by kicking it on, and she spins the little starfish and crab with her feet. It does make a strange 'thunking' sound on some settings, but she doesn't seem to mind. I'd like FP to make a smaller, more user-friendly version of this toy."
2,Not sure if I got a defective model?,"While my 5-month old son IS absolutely mesmerized by the bubbles and lights in the Ocean Wonders Aquarium, I'm wondering if we may gotten a defective one? It makes HORRIBLY loud, groaning, thunking sounds while it runs -- does anyone else's do this? Sounds as though it's on its last leg and might go up in a puff of smoke at any point! We (fortunately) don't rely on it to soothe our son to sleep (I can't believe he could sleep through all that racket). I've tried contacting Fisher Price/Mattel customer service to inquire, but have just gotten the runaround, and unfortunately, our local Toys R Us doesn't have this item in stock to go ""test"" at the store (to see if they are all this noisy!)"
1,Baby hated it!,"Maybe it was the one I purchased, but when I would turn it on, it would make a loud windshield wiper type noise as the fish moved around. Baby did not like it at all. I thought it was a little pricey also. My advice, keep looking."
2,Loud,I now understand why this was upgraded by the manufacturer. Though the toy is appealing to my child the internal parts are extremely loud. This is not a toy that will help put the child to sleep because of the volume of the internal parts.
3,Just OK - motor is loud and it doesn't stay on long enough,"I didn't pay a lot for this, so it's not bad. I definitely would not pay $40+ for it! The motor is kind of loud and it doesn't run long enough in my opinion. I think it only runs maybe 5 mins. and then shuts off. I just use it to occupy my 8 mo. old in the crib while I do some chores in her room (like folding laundry). I keep having to press the button to restart it again. It is cute though."
1,Old model is much better!!!!!!!,"We just got this for a baby gift and had to return it for something else. We had the old model with our 2nd son and loved it, especially when the lights projected on the ceiling!!But this new one does not have this feature and we were not impressed at all, it is just not as great as the oringal one.I guess new is not always better!We took it back and got one with moving birds that project light and music on the ceiling called FLUTTERBY DREAMS by another company, which both us and baby love alot better."
1,If I could give NO starts I would!!!!,"This was purchased for a second baby. The battery pack on this sits outside of the crib - which would seem like a very good idea to make changing the batteries much easier. However, the battery pack OFTEN becomes unattached from the unit and then the thing will not turn on. What a disappointment!!! Do not waste your money - we are going to try the cute little birdies!!"
1,Not as good as the original one!,I don't have many negative reviews about anything but this my family(husband and daughgters-5 and 13) and I were truly dissapointed with! We had the original one for my 5 year old. She still plays it. This one is ridiculously bulky and the motor moving the sea creatures is loud. The music isn't soothing by any means and the little creatures don't move easily around.I don't like this at all. I recommend Fisher Prices aquarium mobile instead. We returned this for that and have been very happy with it. So has our baby!
1,"Stupid, Stupid, Stupid",My sister bought this item for my daughter. I don't know why the battery pack has to be attached to the toy. It is not connecting tight enough and therefore not working. I attached it to the crib and actually had to stand there holding the battery pack so my daughter can enjoy the lights and music.I am throwing it out. I am going to hook up the one my older daughter used two years ago that didn't require a separate battery pack.
3,Nice idea but...,"I bought two of these for my twin 3-month-old sons. Both of them LOVE the music and white noise settings while they're falling asleep - yay! But I have had one of the aquariums sitting on their dresser rather than in their cribs... now that I'd like to put one in each crib - HOLY COW! What a nightmare to put together!!! With a HUGE battery compartment that you have to THEN screw into the rest of the unit, it is very unweildy and impractical. To put it on the back of the crib, closest to the wall, the crib would have to stick out from the wall about 3 inches! (fitting 2 cribs in one room is already a task in itself). And yes, the motor when you turn on the fish and bubbles is soooo loud.Overall my babies love the sounds this aquarium makes, but I am VERY disappointed with the structure of it!! I wouldn't buy this again."
4,"Great toy, but...","My baby (now 9 months) has loved this since he was little. The music quality is great and he enjoys the lights and bubbles. The problem is that he wakes himself up in the middle of the night by accidentally turning it on. It also makes a lot of noise when he bumps into it (even without turning it on) and it wakes me up over the baby monitor. So...we installed it in his play area, on our gate, and he loves it."
1,Impossible to attach to my crib,"This soother is really hard to attach to the crib - you have to unscrew the whole back (yes, tools are required) AND then we learned it doesn't even fit our crib (we have the Simplicity Ellis 4-in-1 Sleep System). The straps that go over the side aren't long enough to attach but without them, it slides down and scrunches our bumper since it's so heavy with 4 D-batteries. My husband used some rubber bands to attach it, but it's supposed to attach to the side of cribs easily and it doesn't. Plus, it doesn't really do much. Overall, I would not recommend it. There must be other soothers that are designed better."
4,we are all enjoying it!,"I bought the ocean wonders musical aquarium attachment for my 4.5 month old son. It's been very fun so far. It was a little complicated to put together. But he stares at it fascinated(we call it baby tv). He has already figured out how to turn it on himself and play with the buttons. Today, he figured out he could turn it on with his feet.I had wanted to get the flutterby dreams because I heard great things about it, but this was half the price so I went with ocean wonders instead."
2,Great toy but bad design for older babies,"I bought this for my daughter for her first birthday. She was pulling on her mobile in her crib so I thought this would be safer for her and since she was already used to falling asleep to music I thought it was a good choice. She is able to turn the music off on the top parental controls because she can stand up, then she gets frustrated and upset when she pushes the seashell and the music doesn't start. It has ended up being more upsetting to her than relaxing. If I go in to turn it on she usually goes right to sleep, but it sometimes happens a few times before she falls asleep for the night. They needed to put those controls at the back of the toy so baby can't get to them. Great for a small babies but not great when they can stand up and are curious!"
2,terrible design,"The only reason im giving this 2 stars is because my [...]loves it.She lies in her crib and turns it on and off with her feet for the first 30 minutes of being awake in the morning.That is its only redeeming factor. ITs impossible to get the battery to stay on, and when the fish are set to rotate it makes this awfully loud noise, now. So i just turned that part off."
3,Fun but loud,"My daughter loves this, but the motor is too loud and the lights are to bright for bed time. There is a music only setting that I use and that is fine. I think this is way overpriced if I am just using it as a music box."
2,Annoying Battery Pack!!,"I was very disappointed with this toy, due to the fact that the battery pack makes it very difficult to operate. I returned the first one because the air duct where the bubbles were supposed to come out wasn't working. I don't recommend this toy."
3,Loud,"I think the idea of this toy has a great concept. However, this item is so LOUD and heavy that it scares you to even put in there crib for the safty hazard of it falling on there head it probably weights a good 5 pounds. I put it by the changing table and that helps him stay calm when I change him, but I wouldn't use it in the crib."
1,A big disappointment & totally frustrating!,"My [...] has the OLD version of the Ocean Wonders Aquarium and he loves it still to this day. Upon learning we were having twins last year, the first thing I set out to buy were two more aquariums for the new babies. When I saw they had a new version with the battery pack on the back, I thought 'terrific! what a great idea! I won't have to take off the entire aquarium to change the batteries.' My excitement quickly faded as the stinking battery pack is WAYYYY too heavy and will not stay connected to the toy, thus making it worthless. And in the slim chance I am able to engage it, as soon as the baby rolls around or moves, the battery pack is no longer engaged. I'm seriously disappointed and hope this new version is removed from the shelves. Do yourself a favor and find the OLD version. Don't waste your money otherwise."
1,Mine doesn't work,"The battery pack on the back of this toy won't stay on, so the music stops before it is supposed to. I've tried everything to get this to work, but only ugly duck tape will keep this toy together. I hope they solve this problem and come up with another model."
1,"I ""WONDER"" Why I bought it!","I had the older model for my first son so naturally I thought that the new model would even be better, boy was I wrong. Everytime my baby touched the aquarium it would turn off. This is because the battery compartment is way too heavy and is not on secure enough. So in order to use it I have to set it in the crib. Ofcourse thats not a good idea because it will end up falling onto my son. All I have to say is - Fisher Price what were you thinkin?"
1,this aqaurium sucks!,I have the older model and I like it tons better. The newer one we had to duct tape to my son's crib so it wouldn't keep shutting off. It has actually made me question buying anything from fisher price in the future!!!
2,Crappy Construction,"My daughter has loved this toy since she was a year old, but the recurring problem we've had with it is the ginormous battery pack is always falling out. It has the potential to be a nice educational and entertaining toy, as she loves pushing the blue seashell to start the music herself and then pointing at the seahorses moving inside the box. But the stupid battery pack disconnects so easily that every few minutes the music and movement inside stop and she starts screaming for me to fix it. I don't understand how this toy has such a high rating when the construction is so poor."
2,Cumbersome to Install,"My older daughter has the old model of the Fisher-Price Aquarium and we love it. We bought this new model for our infant and were surprised to see how the structure has changed. There is a huge battery pack on the back that screws into the aquarium and it is supposed to anchor it to the crib. We are having a very difficult time fitting it onto the crib. Also, the holes in the strap are too small to fit into the pegs on back of the aquarium. I don't know why they changed these features from the old model. I would recommend skipping this model and finding one more like the earlier aquarium."
5,"For $11.99, buy two!","Plays great music, very soothing for babies. Love the bubble action and swimming motion of fish. You may need some additional plastic strapping to install onto crib."
3,Cute and entertaining but bulky!,"I bought this because I thought it was similar to the Flutterbye, by Fisher Price, that my sister-in-law has, but this one is way bulkier and does not have the ceiling projector like the Flutterbye. I was disappointed because I love the Ocean Wonders stuff. But, my 5 week old likes this a lot!"
1,New & Improved-----NOT!,"The parents here have already said it, this product is a huge disappointment from the original model. My son loved his aquarium, but it began to leak so I went out and bought this one (really had no choice since I wasn't able to find the old model). Assembly was a huge hassle----I'm still scratching my head at how FP could have allowed this design to pass! It has a very loud mechanical sound to it that clunks and the light on it is so bright. I woke up to its horrible sound this morning at 5 AM! It's going back today."
1,I returned it!,"I purchased this new model of the Ocean Wonder Aquarium because I needed a second for Grandma's house, and my daughter loves the original. What I did not like was the battery back that attaches outside the crib. If you have to take your mattress out of the crib to change sheets,etc,it would be extremely time consuming to remove this toy because the battery pack is screwed in. Also, the movement of the fish is much louder than the original design. I ended up returning this toy because I was very disappointed. I love all my other Fisher Price products, but this one is not worth the time or money."
2,worth 12$,"I got this for the baby I'm having in January, but it doesn't fit her crib. I put it on my 18 month olds crib, but it is terribly unimpressive. Mine only came with directions on how to install the battery box, but I'm not sure that just wasn't overlooked at the factory. Not a bad deal for 11.99, but I definitely wouldn't pay more than that. I'm glad I got it on sale here."
1,Hated it!!!,"I did not like this toy at all. It was a pain to put together and when I finally did put it together, it made a very unsoothing scratching/squeaky sound. I returned it."
3,Way Too Loud,"We just picked this toy up over the weekend for our 6 week old son. My husband put it together, and he didn't struggle with it too much - but he's also an all around handyman so that may have had something to do with his ease. The baby loves it as long as he's already awake and just looking for something to keep him amused. Last night he woke up for a 3 am feeding and when i put him back in his crib I turned the toy on and it was LOUD. I hadn't realized during daytime with everything else going on around the house how loud it really was. It woke my husband up on the other side of the room (he's a heavy sleeper). It's a super cute toy but it's way too loud when you're trying to get your little one to sleep."
1,disappointed,"I'm very disappointed with this toy! It is hard to assemble and every time when I put on in moving fish and lights my son starts to cry. Just try to find something else, don't buy this one."
1,Terrible Re-Design,"We have the orginal from two years ago and love it. This new one is terrible to attach to the crib. The new HUGE CLUNKY battery pack is horrible- It sticks out of the crib so you can't use this along with a bumper, so we had to wait until we were no longer using a bumper. We have twins and the twin with the old version was able to play with his months before his sister. In addition, it is difficult to keep the battery pack engaged, so often times we go to turn it on and we can't-- we have to wiggle it until the leads match up again.On top of everything else, it sucks batteries like crazy. We put new batteries in both when we put them into the cribs. We have changed the batteries twice on this new version and not once on the old.If you can get the old version-- buy it. Otherwise try a different brand."
2,Don't mess with things that are not broken.,"I bought this to replace the older model, beacause by 18month loves it. I left it at the hotel during Thankgiving. I found it loud and quite obnoxious. My daughter really missed her old fish. So I tracked the old one down and had it shipped to me.The new fish are going back to the store. Like I said there loud and the battery pack that detaches in the back is a pain.Hope this helps, If you can find the previous modle it is squarish in shape.Itis much better and has more bubbles."
3,New does not mean better,"This new version is noisy, bright and hard to put together. The original is MUCH better if you can find it. The problem we are having with both versions is our son can push the buttons on the top and turns the volumn up, but can't figure out down so we put tape over the speaker in the back, and turns it completly off and can't figure out how to turn the parent on and off back on.Good luck..."
2,Very Disappointed,"I like others, did have the old model which we bought in 2001. It had been in storage and when I went to get it out, the fish no longer moved, so I ran out and bought the new version. It is SO bright and SO loud it doesn't soothe my 6 month old to sleep like it did the first time around. I liked the feature on the original model that allowed the light to be out the top and shine on the ceiling. It made the crib much darker yet the fish were still visible. The battery pack also was a bit of a hassle. Bring back the benefits of the older model!!"
1,bad toy,"The motor on this toy is SO loud! I don't know how any baby could fall asleep to this, mine never did. I looked everywhere for the older version and found it. What a difference. That one is so much better and no loud motor. It is so much more soothing. Still doesn't put my baby to sleep but he likes looking at it."
2,a great idea but dangerous,"I bought this crib attachment for my first daughter in 2007, but I never got around to using it. Now four years later I used it with my baby and the attachment has caused alot of problems. It is very complicated to attach it to the crib and requires screwing in the screws, which is not clear. If the screws are not attached then the battery pack can fall out and injure someone. Second, now that my daughter is rolling over and lifting her head she has banged her head badly on the attachment because it juts out. She woke up one morning with a big bruise on her eye. I am very disappointed. One thing I must point out to be fair, my daughter does sleep in a mini crib, so maybe the size of her crib makes to product more hazardous. Either way, there is no warning on the product! I had to take the aquarium off her crib even though she did love it. It did sooth her and entertain her."
2,Bulky and inconvenient,"I shopped around for a soothing crib attachment since my daughter loves my nephew's. I should have gone with the one he has. I have a convertible sleigh crib and it doesn't fit on the side as shown on the pictures. It also has a huge battery pack on the back that makes it a pain to put on. You have to remove the batteries in order to attach it to the crib and it fits so snugly that it won't go over my bumper. So she has to lay sideways in order to see it with the bumper pushed down. For the most part, she likes it. The interactive part on it doesn't really serve much purpose since I turn it on for her to go to sleep. The motor that makes the animals go around is very noisy but she likes the bubbles. I definitely would not recommend this product to anyone."
4,Great toy,"I got this for my twin boys when they were first born to sooth them to sleep. They didn't really care for it until about 5 months or so. It took some punishment and subsequently, so did the wooden crib after the twins moved it back and forth trying to get it off the crib. If you're trying to preserve your crib for whatever reason, this will probably hurt the finish, so you might want to put some kind of cloth under the straps or something. The music is pleasing enough for the kids and the moving fish is a great distraction. The only thing I would like them to change would be that the motor that moves the fish is actually pretty loud if you have the sound all the way down. If you're a child trying to get to sleep (or a mother laying right next to the child) you don't really want to hear the motor, you want to hear the music. Overall, it's a great product and I would suggest you buy two if you have twins!"
2,the old model is better,"This model looks nice but from all the bad reviews it's getting it seems like fisher price has to go back and fix this issue with the battery pack that hangs out of the crib,sounds like a big pain in the butt to me,so I went to a second hand store and bought the old one.It's awesome and my little one loves it.It even helped her get to sleep in her final stages of weaning.I just turn on the music with the soft glow of light and rock her to sleep and I no longer have to nurse her to get her down!And that's just amazing because as perfect(to me)as she is,she's a tough cookie.It's really too bad they discontinued the old version,but if you can find it in a thrift store make sure you grab it!It also just hooks right onto the crib,very easy to install."
4,Soothing bubbles and music - some design issues,"When I first tried this I had the same problem other reviewers here had. The battery pack kept losing contact from the unit, stopping the function. This was very frustrating for my son.I took a closer look at the instructions, and it turns out I missed a step. The battery pack actually attaches itself with screws to the main unit (from inside underneath the batteries.As far as the function, yes the motor is fairly loud, but babies actually like the noise. I think that a lot of babies like white or a humming noise. My sone really loves the bubbles and spinning the crab.I wish it looked better attached to the crib, from outside of the crib you see this large plastic blue battery pack, but at least it serves its purpose."
1,Motor Too Loud,"I bought this for my 7 week old and I was excited to finally have this since I'd heard so many wonderful things about the previous two styles of the Aquarium. I couldn't wait to hear the relaxing bubbles sound that would put my baby to sleep. I loaded the batteries in, turned it on and my 4 year old and I both said ""what is that noise?"" It was the motor that is used to move the 3D fish around in a circle. The motor was so loud and annoying. You could hardly hear the music even with the volume up. Since the bubbles only float up on the mode that moves the fish, you couldn't hear the bubbles at all. Also, the music is really odd. I had read that in some reviews on the older models so apparently that hasn't changed. What a disappointment. I returned my Aquarium to Walmart and am now hunting for another soother."
3,Make Sure it will fit,We were so excited to get this toy because a friend recommended it and said her little girl loved it. The only problem is that when we got it all put together we tried to put it on our crib and it won't fit/work with the slots on our crib. And now that's its opened and put together we can't return it. You also have to position it just right to get the music and lights to work.
2,Difficult to Use,"I had heard wonderful things about the older version of this toy. We purchased the newer version and had a lot of difficulty getting it to work properly. It was so big that it constantly pushed down on our bumper pad, and we were not able to get the screw to line up to make it work. It was heavy and bulky. I love the idea of fish, aquarium sounds and soothing bubbles, so we got the Calypso Mobile instead, which has many of the same benefits with some additional ones. (see my review of the Calypso Mobile)."
3,Love/hate this aquarium,"I have a love/hate relationship with this aquarium. I love it on the sounds only setting, as the ocean noise puts my son right to sleep. I hate it on the motion/lights/sound setting, as the motor grinds really loudly as the fish move. I love that it attaches securely to the crib, but I hate that it's a pain in the butt to get it that way. I hate that if you happen to jiggle the battery pack just a tiny bit, the whole thing shuts off and is hard to line back up again. But I love the songs that it plays, we sing along with ""Tell Me Why"" as we're getting ready for bed.Most important, though, is that my son likes it. He talks to the fish, spins the crab, and figured out pretty quickly to push the seashell to turn the music off. If they could just fix the quirks, it would be fantastic.Oh, and I don't know if anyone else has this problem, but my son's room is right next to mine, and when I leave it on the ocean setting... I find I make a lot more trips to the bathroom."
3,Great until they start sitting up,"This toy has been wonderful for entertaining our little girl while she is in her crib, but it has never been useful for getting her to go to sleep. It does not soothe her, it excites her. Also, fisher price will show you this cute picture of a baby sitting up next to the aquarium. What they don't understand is that when your little one starts sitting up and pulling up on the crib slats they will get alot of knots and bruises from slamming their head into this thing. Make sure you take it out at this time. I just removed mine after my daughter knocked her head on it twice in the span of five minutes. The entertainment is not worth her hurting herself."
2,Would love it if it worked!,"First I must start by saying my son really loves this product. That being said, we are on our THIRD one and none of them have worked properly! They all have a problem with the fish moving and/or bubbles. The first one worked for about a week then the bubbles stopped working. Second one the fish moved VERY slowly and made a lot of noise. The third one was working fine for ONE DAY and now the fish don't move at all and the bubbles come out of one tiny area. I have been very disappointed in most of our Fisher Price items since my son has been born. We will be returning this one and trying AGAIN only b/c my son really likes it but what a headache!!!!"
2,Poor quality,I got this toy for my first grandson for Christmas 2005. My daughter loves the toy and says it helps put the grandson to sleep. Only problem is it stopped working after only one month. Changing batteries did not help. Of course the box was thrown away as with all the Christmas gifts or I would return it. It is extremely bulky to fit on the baby crib also.
2,Cute but doesn't last very long.......,"My wife and I had seen this advertised on tv and thought it would be a big help getting our son to sleep in his crib. He loved it but there were a few problems. It only lasts about 2 minutes which is not nearly long enough for him to fall asleep. There should be settings on it for different lengths of time. Also, the fish started to get stuck after a week or two. Something with the motor. My son still loves to watch the fish but it isn't quite worth what we paid. Needs improvements."
1,Disappointing!!!!!,"I agreee 100% with pp's. This thing is awful. I bought the old model in 2002 for my son who still uses his fishies. He loves them. The new model is cheap, loud (all you can hear is the whizzing motor), impossible to put together. I'm so glad I am not the only that feels this way. Well I guess on the bright side, we will only have one fishie addict in the house."
3,Battery life a big minus,"This is a great soother for my baby, but the battery life on mine is aweful! I set my baby room up a few months before the baby was born and when she arrived and I wanted to play this for her, the batteries were already dead. I did not realize you have to keep the thing cut to the off position in order to keep the batteries for any length of time. She just moved into her crib a few weeks ago and we started using it, and I have had to put in two sets of batteries already. The lady at Fisher Price told me, ""well, you have to keep it turned off or it will drain the batteries.""....NOt a very good thing if you have to go back and turn it off everytime you use it to put the baby to sleep."
2,Broke in three months,This was a great toy my son loved it. It kept him in his crib when I needed to do things and soothed him to sleep. Untill much to my dismay the motor went out. Now all it does is play the music. My son loved his fish going around. I am not happy.
3,Nice but whoever designed the battery compartment should be shot,"It's fun and entertaining, but what a pain the @ss it is to replace the batteries in this thing!! You have to detach the entire thing from bed, detach two plates, and take out no less than SEVEN screws!! What a nightmare!! Otherwise, it's fine except they need a dimmer on the light- useless during the evening."
1,Designer should be shot,"As a new father I have had to put together and set up many of the new toys for my baby. I have found that most of the directions and the way these things are put together are stupid, this Fisher Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium is the worst. The only wonder is how I havent thrown it out the window yet.The way it mounts to the crib is just plain crazy. Why do you need to have this thing Screw through the crib???? Why is there a stupid little cut off switch built in???? Forget about mounting on the side up aganist the wall. You would have to move the entier crib away from the wall just to change the batteries.And could they have made the motor in this thing any LOUDER???Its an Ocean Wonders Aquarium why dose it not have ocean or water noise, only the standard lullabys. Save your money, go with something else."
3,could be better,"We bought this for our 3 month old son. I bought it to entertain him while I get dressed in the morning. It does get his attention and he is able to play with the spinning ball, and crab and can push the music button. The poblem is the music button that he can push turns the music on and off. My 3 month old turns it off and doesn't know how to turn it back on so I'm constantly running to his crib to start it back up for him so he doesn't get bored with it. I also had the problem of the battery box on the back falling off so I had to push it against the wall to keep it on, which may or may not be a problem depending on whether or not your crib is against a wall. Great idea but could be better designed!"
4,Wonderful distraction from crying fits!,"Okay, I do agree with others on the fact that it is somewhat of a pain to put together and attach to the crib. I just think that maybe that is because anything that is going to be going on my child's crib had better be bolted down and not have any loose parts. Once it was together, our 4 month old absolutely loved it. It has been a wonderful success at catching his attention when he was inconsolable due to having shots at the doctor's and also just from some usual fussy baby times. We love it!"
2,so sad...,"The ocean wonders aquarium has been in our family since my 1st was born 5 years ago. We LOVED the original model and it has gone down hill from then. This is the worst by far. What is with the huge battery compartment? It is loud and the back disconnects, turning the whole thing off. It doesn't last long enough for her to fall asleep before shutting off and the one setting that all my kids have loved ""the bubbles"" won't stay on. I am usually happy with Fisher price but they bombed on this one."
2,VERY DISSAPOINTED,"I purchased this item when my daughter was about 1 month old. First of all, like all the other parents said....it is a HUGE hassle to change the batteries. She is now 4 1/2 months old and I have changed the batteries twice. One thing that really bothers me is when you look at this item online and click on the ""watch in action"" button it shows it playing really soft music. NOT EVEN CLOSE!! Like another review, the motor that moves the sea things around is SOOO LOUD. It is not soothing AT ALL. I would not recommend this product."
4,My little one loves it!,"My four month old loves watching this! I keep it on the 3rd level (with all functions going *light, music, and moving fish*) and she watches it before bed time! With my first daughter I had a rough time putting her to bed when she got to be about a year old, because I never let her fall asleep on her own. With this, my second daughter has no trouble!My only wish is that it had a remote, but other than that, I (and my baby!) love this!"
2,Fish don't move!,My 3 month old enjoys the lights and bubbles but the fish get stuck on the track and don't move around the corners. This happened straight out of the box. I called Fisher Price and they said if I return the straps they'll send a new one in 6-8 weeks. I have to pay for shipping to return the straps. It always stinks when something is broke right out of the box! At least the bubbles and music keep him entertained for now. I wouldn't recommend this unless they fix the track. I also agree that the batteries are a pain to replace b/c of screws. It seems like many baby toys are moving over to this. As if parents have time to hunt for screwdrivers on top of all else we need to do! A plug in version would be great. This item takes 3 D batteries.
4,"Is pretty good, weird attachment method","I can understand why they attempted to make the batteries easier to access, but really it doesn't buy much by having the pack on the outside of the crib. Installing it was much more complicated than the earlier version (although still manageable). This toy never made it to my 9 month old's crib because my 3 year old snagged it and likes to play with it (he had one when he was very young, but I didn't think he'd remember it, I guess he did!). It stands up by itself on the side of his twin bed up against the wall because of the new battery pack, so I guess that's a benefit?The movement of the fish seems louder than the previous version, but not too loud. The light on this one is not too bright or dim. All in all, its good, I liked the original version better though :)"
3,This is for young children,I purchased the Ocean Wonders for my son's 2nd birthday and he was not interested at all. It was easy to install and I'll keep this for the next child :-)
2,"Could be great, but big mistakes","I bought this for my youngest son because my older child loved his! I mean really, really loved his, actually he still does!I thought that the new design was ok. I kind of missed the fish bobbing up and down. It was also much harder to assemble. I thought that the removable battery compartment would be great! On the older model you had to take the whole aquarium off of the crib (or headboard) to change the batteries, which could be a big hassle. Well the battery compartment comes loose and then the aquarium won't work. This happens A LOT! What a pain."
1,A Pain!,"I bought this for my daughter while we were on a trip-she can't sleep without her music! We have the Fisher Price lullaby soother (the one with the little birds, I think it's called the flutterby) and I had forgotten it. This one is such a pain. The batteries are in a seperate box that ""plugs"" into the back of the music box and it constantly falls off. Don't waste your money, buy the one with the little birds, I promise you will enjoy it more!"
2,Too noisy to soothe,"We had a previous version of this toy when our 5-year-old was a baby. It was really great-- played music or wave sounds, nice lights, and the fish went around in a circle. When it died on us, we asked for a new one for our new baby. This latest version is a huge disappointment. The changes in the features were expected and tolerable. However, when the fish are in motion, it is too loud. The motor makes an annoying buzzing sound. Also, the volume control will only allow you to turn the music down so far. You cannot turn it down to a level that we thought was conducive to sleep.I will say, though, that it fastens more securely that the previuos model.On the whole, though, if this type of toy were important to me, I would shop around more."
2,"Old version is, by far, more superior","I hate the new disgn of this product. The detachable battery pack sucks. We have the old version for our 18 month old and he loves it and uses it to soothe himself at night and I wanted to have the same option for our 7 month old however, this version is horrible. I wish they would not have redesigned the product. It was great the way it was."
1,Useless,"The battery pack would not stay tight so therefore the toy would not work most of the time. I could not get a good snug fit on the crib so it would slide to the bottom, but the directions sat to keep the toy elevated. I thought it would be a cute fun toy for my daughter, but it's not much good if the battery pack won't stay connected. I found it bulky, time consuming and a waste of my time trying to get it to fit to the crib. I returned it!!!"
1,"New & ""IMPROVED""?","Like many other reviewers, I have the older model for my son. He loves it, and can't sleep without it now. When he goes for overnights with his grandparents, we have to make sure to pack the ""fishies"" or he won't go to sleep! I bought this new & supposedly improved model for my nephew and it was terrible. Didn't fit his crib, sound was awful, and it would have been a huge pain to change the batteries. I took it back and found an old model (still unopened in box) on ebay. Paid more for it than the new one, but it was worth it!"
1,"Unuseable, not worth the money","I was like the other reviewers...I had the original aquarium for our son, and bought 2 of the new ones one for each of our children when our daughter was born so they would both have a new and improved aquarium. I remember also that I paid a lot of money for these. Needless to say, the seperate clunky battery pack will not stay in place because there is a small ""plug"" area that the battery pack connects to and from the weight of the battery pack the connection will not stay, so I can't use itI have never written a review about a toy before, but I am very disappointed with this. I think the improvements would be great for my children to enjoy, but my aquariums have gone back into the closet since i never could get either of them to work and stay connected."
1,A complete waste of my time!!!,"Don't you hate it when you bundle up your little one, go to the store, purchase something, only to get it home and find that it's not what it claimed to be? This is the case with this item. I saw a friend's old version, and thought the new one must be even better. I couldn't even get it to run properly because the battery pack was so heavy on the outside of the crib that it kept detaching itself. Plus it's very bulky and ugly hanging off the outside of the crib. Save yourself the time of wasting 2 trips to the store, unpacking, & repacking, etc. and skip this item!!!"
2,Stupid Battery Pack,I thought this new model looked great in the store so I bought it for my 1 month old baby. When I got it home and tried to put it up yesterday I discovered that it won't work on our crib. The battery pack is too wide to fit through the slats on our crib so while I can hang it up...I can't turn it on. I'm really disappointed that FP didn't do more research on the width of most new crib slats before making this new model. I'm hoping I can find the old model somewhere. I gave 2 stars only because it looks very nice and works wonderfully....if you can get it work on your crib. I measured and the battery pack is just under 2 inches wide. Measure your slats before purchasing! I have to return mine now.
1,ocean wonders musical aquarium crib attachment,"I was quite disappointed with the item.It looked used, even though clean. It was an older model than I expected. The back of it does not fit into the spokes of the crib thereby making it jutt out too much, awkwardly, for the baby to play with and it is something that needs attention to turn it on and shut it off. The model I was looking for turns itself off and you leave it in the on position until baby presses various buttons to make different noises."
4,They love it!,I bought this for my 7 month old twins. They lie in their cribs when they wake in the morning and play and kick at their aquariums. Keeps them happy till I or my husband gets out of bed at 6:45. My only complaint is that the motor that turns the fish around is noisy. I don't have it on that setting at night for that reason. However - they don't mind the motor noise!
1,Beware! batteries leak!,This crib toy was great until the battery acid began to leak and trickled the rails of the crib and of course my daughter got it on her hands and mouth. Fortunately she didn't get any burns on her skin or mouth but this stuff has lead in it and all sorts terrible things. I was VERY upset. We have had the toy for a little over a year. I'm just surprised I haven't seen any recalls.
1,Old technology,"I bought this for my son because it looked like it might help him get to sleep. The problem is there is a battery pack (quite large) that you have to attach to the back of the ""fish tank."" This pack does not snap into place. Once you let go of it, it loosens slightly from the back of the toy, and the toy won't work. You would think the manufacturer could find some place to put the batteries within the actual toy instead of having to have a completely separate bulky battery pack. Fisher Price might look into hiring some new product designers."
2,Why can't they get this right?,"We had the older model that was also round looking with two fish. My daughter loved it but the gears came off and it started clicking and the fish wouldn't move anymore. The square looking model was tacky looking to me so I was so happy to see this one now that I have a new baby b/c I thought it looked similar to the original model. The battery pack fell off the crib and broke the first time I tried to put it on. If you have a Next Generation or any other large, sleigh type crib.forget it. There is no way to attach it. I had to set it in a corner and tie the straps to the crib with fishing line. They need to make the straps way longer(test this on different types of cribs).Next problem....it needs more water in front of the toys. It is obvious they are not in the water(not a problem on the older model), it would make better bubbles too. I like the fish and the music."
1,What was wrong with the ORIGINAL?,"How disapointing. We just evacuated Hurricane Rita and did not remember to bring our original Aqauarium with us. So my mother-in-law bought us this piece of crap (not her fault). We intended on buying another anyway for our baby who is due any day (our 2 year old son still LOVES his, but this one is going back tomorrow.) We could not get it to stay together (just read the review about the hidden screw) so we taped it up for the night. What was wrong with the original? So the fish just move up and down instead of around, we didn't even use that function. He just likes the water sounds and lights and then plays with the toys in the morning. Fisher-Price, bring back the old one!"
3,I want the old version back Fisher Price!,"I don't like the new one. It's motor is loud, the songs aren't as good and there not as many bubbles. I looked and looked for an older version with no avail so I settled for the new one. I also don't like how you can't sample the songs in the store before you but it. I would like to trade my older child his so that I could put it into the babie crib but he would have none of it!"
5,My toddler still uses,"I have gone through three versions of this toy with all three of my children (I bought the newest version with each child). I don't have this newest NEW version, but I have the one right before this one.All my kids loved the aquariums as babies, but I found it a pain to continually restart it for them (a remote would be great!) And they all have had the problem of eating up batteries, so it sounds like this new version with a separate battery pack would help in changing those batteries (unless it really is difficult to remove as one other person has said.)When my youngest was old enough to sit up and push the button himself, he began to play the aquarium to go to sleep. Sometimes I would check on him and think he was asleep and turn it off. He would immediately wake up and turn it back on. Now that he is 2 years old and in a toddler bed, I have attached the aquariam to the headboard and he still uses it to get to sleep."
4,10 Month old loves it and has slept with it for 8 months,"The gentle light (which can be turned off), bubbles, and moving characters make this a mesmerizing toy. It also plays very soothing music and very pretty music. Also comes with running water sound. Really helped my daughter sleep in her own bed. She can turn it on herself now, and sometimes, during the night we will hear that she turned it on and went back to sleep. As other reviewes have noted, the toy does make a noisy sound I would describe as grinding gears, but my daughter was not bothered by it."
3,LOUD FISHIES,"I bought this with the hopes of it being soothing for my daughter (now 2 months). My husband and I had a hard time at first attaching it to the crib as our crib top back rail is wide. We ended up placing on the side rails and she has to turn her head to see it. The music is very soothing, I can hear it through her monitor and fall asleep to it; however, when the fish are in motion- THE MOTOR IS VERY LOUD- louder than the music. My friend had the same problem with a model of an earlier version she purchased in 2000. When you call Fisher Price thinking that it is defective, they indicate that is how the model works. OVerall I keep it on the light and music mode and my daugher seems to enjoy it"
3,"Good toy, BAD design!","We recieved this toy as a gift. We used it most when my son was a newborn. The music helped lull him to sleep. We had a horrible time getting it to work at times. It is two pieces, the intention is to be able to use it on the side of the crib, however if the two pices are not aligned correctly it will not work. Sometimes I even found myself having to hold it together. Not one of the better toys out there."
1,Too Bulky and Noisy...and a bit overpriced,"I found this item bulky, and hard to place on the crib safely. Seems back heavy due to the HUGE battery area. I thought we were liveing in the 21st century..where is the simplicity and technology?"
3,"Cute, but needs improvements","My son loves to listen to music, so i bought this product so he could also have something to watch while lying in his crib. The various song selection is great.... but when you turn on the animation feature, the motor is way louder then the music that is playing. In fact it's even somewhat annoying to anyone sitting in the next room. My son seems to enjoy it.... but he also like to stare at ceiling fans."
4,It keeps him entertained,"We received this toy from my son's grandparents when he was first born. It does keep his amusement for some time, however, I don't turn it on if I am trying to get him to go to sleep. It is so loud that it ends up waking him up instead of lulling him to sleep. I only put it on when he is laying in his crib and needs something to keep him occupied. The fish and music will amuse him enough to allow me to get some chores done."
5,EXCELLENT!,"This aquarium is wonderful. My son LOVES it!He plays with it in his crib, and within 10 to 15 minutes, he is asleep! Definitely worth purchasing!"
3,Entertaining for the baby; a hassle for Mom & Dad,"My son loved the earlier version of this aquarium so much that he would not give it up to his baby sister, so we went out and bought a second one, albeit the newer model.I was stunned at the difficulties introduced into the redesign. Placing the aquarium on and off the crib rail requires a screw driver and lots of squinting... where as the old one had a couple of straps and could easily be removed and replaced. I am not looking forward to the day I have to pull out the screwdriver again to replace the batteries on this new unit.It's also much larger. Because it extends outside and above the rail of the crib, we could only place it on the rail that was not against the wall (and therefore squarely in the way of our arm's path for laying down/picking up baby).I encourage anyone considering this purchase to hunt for the old model instead."
2,Not that impressed,"A coworker of mine raved about this product and how her son loves it so much. She must have been referring to the older version, but I'm not that impressed with this item.First of all, the battery compartment is a hassle...It appears as if it can easily fall off. Second, I'm having the hardest time attaching this to the crib. Third, I'm pusing in the button to play the music and sometimes the music turns on, and sometimes you have to press it multiple times before it plays. Fourth, the motor is so loud, I can't see how this can be so soothing. I just hope baby will like it better than I do. (Baby due to arrive any day now.)"
2,"Motor very loud, bigger than it appears","The toy is fairly nice as it does appear to capture the attention of my son at night and calms him down when we put him to bed. Yet, it sounds like the older version was better. Frankly, in my view, there are two problems with the current version.First, the motor that moves the fish around is quite loud. Even with the music at the loudest level you can still hear the gears rotating loudly (probably more annoying for parents than the child).Second, to attach the product to the crib, you hang the display (the part you see in the picture on Amazon) and then need to screw in a large battery box through the crib openings. As such, there is a large (think the size of two cans of Coke) box that sticks out the side of the crib and looks very bad/tacky."
2,Discontinued for a reason,"This toy has been discontinued at stores so I ordered it online. Boy, was I sorry. The battery pack does not attach properly and leaves a gap. Due to the weight of the batteries, the pack needs additional support to hold it on securly (duck tape/string). I even sent back my first order to find the replacement was worse."
4,Decent book,I didn't really use this book much except that some assignments came from the book. I didn't find it to be too helpful with my studying. I used other materials for a better understanding in technical writing.
2,"Great Idea, Cheap Production","This is a great idea. When it works it is an efficient, time-saving, neat way to expertly cut and serve a piece of cake. Unfortunately this idea was/is produced out of the country using materials that are guaranteed to break. If you check the reviews at the inventor's site you will see numerous complaints about the same thing, the handles break off. I will continue looking for this or another manufacturer to produce a like product, made in the U.S. out of sturdy materials. The one I have cost $10.00, if I thought it would last $15.00 would be a fair price."
5,The definitive Style Council,"If you're looking to get into the Style Council, The Complete Adventures boxset is a good deal, as it includes their entire studio output. For those short on budget or time there are many other TSC greatest hits CDs, but this one is easily the best. The tracklist for this compilation looks like it was made by an actual fan. While commercially successful with the release of their first two albums, TSC put out great material throughout their entire career, and this CD reflects that moreso than any of the many other greatest hits CDs available."
5,Good products and servie!,"One piece was damaged during shipping, and Amazaon provided fast and fabulous coustomer service. This is my second set of Berndes. For me, 10-quart stockpot in this set is too big for 2 to 3 people's family, and the 7-quart that I'bought earlier was better. 2-1/2-quart sauté pan in this set is too small for me to cook stir fried veggie for 2 people. I wish they had balanced those two off. Overall, Berndes Tradition 10-piece are good products."
5,You won't buy another set!!,"Love these. Heavy and solid. they haven't warped and I doubt they will. I just love them! easy clean up too. I got my set thru the amazon warehouse..for a steal! one lid knob was damaged,,{amazon customer service was QUICK and resolved the problem by offering a % of credit for the damages},,however I think that may have been why they were returned. The lids have the knobs inverted so the lids nest inside of one another in shipping. You just UN-screw the knob...and put it on the outside of the lid. I think the previous owner of this set screwed the knob too tight and broke the plastic knob washer/collar. But Still a Great set that I'm thrilled to own!"
1,MISSING LID AND HANDLE SHIM,Upon opening this set I found the lid for the 9 1/2 in fry pan was missing (671024)And one of the plastic shims that goes below the knob was broken on one of the other lids.both half's were in the packingCan you please send me the missing parts?if you would like to call I can be reached at 402 578 8845best regardsGary
4,Criminally overlooked,"This 2CD set does an adequate job of introducing Verlaine's genius. The live CD is just ferocious, as compelling as Television's ""The Blow Up"" but tighter. Just great. Amazing guitar work from both Verlaine and compatriot Jimmy Ripp, solid backing by Fred Smith and Jay Dee Daugherty.The retrospective CD is good, though I wish they had chosen fewer tracks from ""Cover"" and more from the brilliant ""Dreamtime"" and ""Flash Light"". But since ""Cover"" is the only album Verlaine recorded for Virgin (the label behind this release) that's probably to be expected. Big plus - the inclusion of the wonderful Verlaine/Richard Lloyd ""Call Mr. Lee,"" with Lloyd's Stratocaster moving sideways over the chorus like an angry crab.Completists will complain but the uninitiated will enjoy this."
2,Not His Best,"I have seen TV, I have seen Tom and this ""Anthology"" is a mixed bag too loose to keep me into it. I guess I did not read the review well. I know he just wants to be his own ""magician"" and all, but I was expecting ""his"" best as a solo artist. This is not ""it"" for a pop fan. This is more for the ""fanatical"" Verlaine ""fan"".Buy his cd's and make your own ""Anthology"", you will be a lot happier. Later."
2,Power Rangers The Morphin Series,This episode is about when the rangers lose their memories caused by Zedd's lastest monster and now they dont even know that they are the power rangers!By coincidence Bulk and Skull save them and finally realize who the rangers really are but they soon forget and the rangers identity is still a secret for now.
2,"fun start, got bored rather quickly","if you're looking for a good ""he kidnapps her and they fall in love"", that's not a very good one..."
4,(no title),"Three 20th century pieces for piano and orchestra in the romantic tradition. Delightful listening, fine performances."
5,Great psychobilly album,"a little of psycho, a little of rockabilly & a touch country = the new album of ZGT. Buy it"
1,Picture is not correct!,I ordered this thinking it was for a 4 barrel carburetor as in the picture. WRONG! After paying for next day shipping I was sent a 2 barrel carb kit. Which is what the Holley 3-887 part number is for. But since there is no description of what it is I went by the picture and i was ordering from my phone. So I wasted money on the shipping and now I'm waiting for 2-3 more plus days for the correct kit to get here and my boat is out of the water for the weekend.It's too bad Amazon can't put a description of the product and doesn't even have the right picture of the kit.
1,Erotic Witch Project 2 - Book of Seduction,"This was a horrible movie that was not worth the time. It did not even come close to its predecessor. A lot of screaming and yelling, and the stupid ape is back with a hat that lets him communicate in English. The acting is terrible, the writing is worse and unless you are into nipple rings and tounge studs the girl on girl scenes aren't much fun either. The girl reporter and the sheriff may be the two worst roles that were ever filmed. Save your money."
2,Not as cool as it looked,"It's not as cool as it looked being advertised. I can't get a ring to go for the life of me beyond 6 feet. I would save the money, this is one the kids will play with for about 30 mins before tossing it aside."
4,A good buy.,"This was very cool to get, but I have a complaint with the description. It can only shoot about 4-5 feet, despite that they say it can shoot fourteen. Except for that it is perfect, and is very fun. Also when you make more fog, a blue light turns on so you can shoot rings in the dark. There is also a faster, and a slower switch that allows you to choose about how far, how fast, and in a way how big. I would buy this item"
1,Good until page 68,"Got to p68 and nearly threw up at the completely out-of-the-blue, unnecessary description of the sexual molestation of an abandoned child. WT??? I'm sick of books that take the terrible, shame-to-all-humanity Catholic Priests' sex scandal and make it into ALL clergy for ALL of history have to molest children. Disgusting, wanton act by an irresponsible author wanting to be very pseduo-PC. RUINED an otherwise fun book. This sort of thing belongs ONLY in memoirs of those who suffered it."
5,A big hit on campus,"I sent this to my daughter during finals week. She said that everyone loved it, in fact she had to hide it so she could have a peice for the next day."
3,Thin Steel and Lightweight,"This stainless steel mortar and pestle looks incredibly nice, but the product quality is a barely adequate. The steel is very thin, making the mortar very lightweight. Lightweight may be a good feature in most kitchen products, but mortars need to be heavy so they do not bounce around during use. The manufacturer needs to use a heavier gauge of steel to make this product more sturdy and stable.Also, the mortar is too small and shallow. The mortar would be more useful if the bowl were wider and deeper."
1,Amco Motar & Pestle,"Although the product looks great, it is very lightweight. Both the motar and pestle are hollow and it is too shallow for my purposes. Will be returning it. The search will go on for a heavier, solid steel, deeper one."
4,2002 Ford zx2,"I installed this item in my 2002 Ford ZX2 with 90,000 miles on it. Instructions were hard to see but K&N website has them in color so easier to follow on there. Took a few hours to install. I intalled the air system and switched to a full synethic oil at the same time and saw around a 5-6 MPG increase. Not sure which helped more. It sounds really cool and seems to give it a little more power."
4,an indespensible book for learning and for reference,"If you want to use MacPerl (the excellent port of Perl to MacOS, loaded with useful Mac-specific functions), you can do it one of two ways:You can buy this book; or you you can poke around aimlessly for about two years learning, by trial and error (and guess, and crash), what is clearly laid out in this book.Two years ago I was an already fairly experienced Perler, but with little experience with MacPerl. If I'd had this book two years ago, it would have saved me more time than I really even want to admit -- weeks? Months?As MacPerl is rapidly becoming the data-conversion meta-tool, file-management language, and all-around Swiss Army chainsaw of choice for MacOS, you can't afford not to have this book."
1,20 pages at the most,"This book touches on several subjects without really explaining very many of them. Perhaps written by persons better able to write code than books, the syntax is overly loose and informal. The really useful data in this book would fit about 20 pages. The rest is teaser and fluff, the beginning of an idea without the essence. MacPerl is a wonderful, free tool for the Macintosh, but this book is not worth the price of admission.To sum it all up, its a hack job and a frustrating read."
5,I really loved Super Easy Bag Lunches!!!~!!!~!!!,I really loved Super Easy Bag Lunches!!!! I was extremely impressed that my mom (the author of Super Easy Bag Lunches) could write such a good book. I am sure it will help many people make good lunches for their kids!! -Cathryn
2,Not as good as I'd hoped...,"I had the chance to meet Kalila on a recent visit to New Orleans. Great person and a wonderful story teller...I just think she speaks better than she writes. This book is just ""so-so"" but could be viewed as great by a beginner."
2,Half a biography,"This article is supposed to be a biography, but that's only half right. After carefully documenting Dr. Hawkins' first forty years, with references to his education, his marriage to Dorothy Willacy-Barnes, his publications, and his employment at various companies and universities, the article falls silent about his last thirty years. According to this ""biography"", Dr. Gerald S. Hawkins apparently went into hibernation after 1969.What about Julia M. Dobson, his second wife? Was he a widower or divorced? Does either wife survive him? Do his daughters survive him? Where did he work from 1969 to 2003? Was he blacklisted or something? Where did he live? Did he travel? Did he do any research? Did he receive any further honors? The Gale Reference Team doesn't know, or isn't telling.This article is pathetic, and not worth the money I paid for it. I wish I'd gone to Wikipedia."
1,Plenty of Ice But No Zebra,"Maclean lost his battle with alcoholism later in life, and it adversely affected his output. His novels became shorter and their characterization flatter, and in Athabasca, he presents one character's alcoholism in virtually a positive light. The plot of this story is forgettable too and there's only about ten pages near the end where 'master of suspense' can be applied to the writing. A sad decline for someone who was the Tom Clancy of his day and is virtually forgotten barely fifteen years after his death. As for this book, read Ice Station Zebra if you want to play in the snow!"
3,Lost in a snowstorm,"This is not one of MacLean's tightly-plotted masterpieces, but it does make a satisfying head-movie on a hot summer day. The oil fields of Alaska and the tar sands of Canada are being threatened by some shadowy and efficient terrorist organization. Our two intrepid investigators are out to find out what's going on.Included: research nuggets about oil and the effects of extreme cold. Adorably crusty characters. Pretty girls. Hard drinking. Fisticuffs.Read if: You are a MacLean completist. You love the cold books.Skip if: You're in it for the tight plotting.Read instead:San Andreas"
3,Athabasca,"Two agents investigate industrial sabotage against a pipeline in Alaska and the Athabasca Oil sands in Canada. This adventure novel is actually more of an old fashioned mystery novel. Our heroes, Dermott and Mackenzie investigate various events of sabotage/murder and the novel ends with the scene where everybody is gathered and the heroes explain who's guilty and how they did it. There are some suspense towards the end, but not much. Its biggest asset is MacLean's occasional humor and character descriptions. Not a bad book but also not very good."
5,fix for shin scrapes,"Go to your local pharmacy and buy some ""moleskin"" (adhesive backed soft stuff), split a sheet length-wise and apply to the top of the front of the boots. This will protect your shins untill the boots are fully broken in."
4,A different look at things,"This is the first book that pretty much focusses on the use of swords as a religion. Sure there have been other series that use swords throughout, but never with such intensity such as the way Reichert presents it.I am reading the sequel to it, The Western Wizard, right now, and to tell you the truth, I am doing it only because I am bored. These are great books, but there isn't all that much action that makes you hold on to them every second. However, this is just my opinion, and I might be looking for something different in a book than you. So, to brief it up, I think this book is definately worth it to read, is has some great characters, and makes you think. If you don't like it, then no harm, just don't continue the series.Reichert does a good job, and I congratulate him for this book."
2,This doesn't grow on you.,I read this novel when it was first published and I remember liking it. I bought the next two books and I don't ever remember finishing them. I went back to this book and reread it after many years wondering why I never finished the trilogy. Now I remember.The justification for the actions of the characters in this book is awful. It does not matter what crime you commit as long as we can all get along in the end. What claptrap. I remember reading this as a teenager and thinking it was ok but know as an adult I recognize the poor plot structure involved in this book.Me. I would have killed Garn publicly whipped Matrian (sp) and then sent her to a nunnery for the rest of her days. Give me a break. This was a good idea gone bad.
3,Interesting but Uneven,"I went into this book really, really wanting to like it. The characterization was decently good, and the plot was easy to follow, the world interesting. But I was left with a consistent feeling of disappointment. Reichert took the story in unexpected directions, and it left me with the feeling of being jerked around willy-nilly until the story finally settled down.The second half of the book was superior to the first half, and the series does continue to improve, but if I hadn't already purchased the next volume, I doubt I'd have read it."
2,Not terribly impressive,I've read quite a bit of fantasy and I have to say that I didn't find this all that impressive. The book has little depth and the plot meanders on with seemingly no purpose for some time. There are reedeming moments but overall I would not give this a recommendation.
3,"a little baggier than the photo in real life, now i get catalogs from jos a bank...","pants are ok, look like the photo, although a little more baggy than i expected... measurements are accurate and holds a crease well. funny, i didnt know i could be opted in for mail catalogs from this place by shopping through amazon, but i was -- i will opt out at some point, i guess..."
5,Dora the Explorer: Dora's Fantastic Gymnastics Adventure,Really fun video for young (3-6) gymnasts. I purchased this for a granddaughter who loves gymnastics and enjoys the video.
5,Dora,I got this as a gift for my grandaughter for her birthday. She is just starting to really like gymnastics so she will love watching this!
3,Poor initial information.,It was wrong area dvd. No mention it was 1 not 2 until I received it. I ordered it from UK and nothing was said about compatibility. One very unsatisfied customer and a child who was disappointed.
1,I hate it.,Everyone hates Dora. Nobody likes her. She's stupid. We really need to find something else. The kids made me buy this.
3,Occupies kids,"I can't honestly review this movie because I am not its intended audience. I will say that it mesmerizes children in a most helpful way, and for that it earns three stars."
5,great movie,Great movie! Arrived on time as planned and my daughter absolutely loves it. No cracks no scratches. Just perfect all out
4,Great Cover,"Finish on cover is a little too slick, and seems like the button for latch should be on top so Fire would lay flat with screen facing up. Other than that, it is of great quality and workmanship."
5,Luther is the Best!,"I agree with Nubuzz, Brenda and Bgraves totally!!! All of his songs brings something special into my heart and relationships! There is not one single song of Luther's that I dislike!!! The man is just great! And like Brenda, I have spent many nights driving on the streets and highways just listening to him with the sunroof open and all windows down! He is a truly GREAT, GREAT, very talented man!! I don't know what is wrong with Robert W., but the man needs some serious help!!! My love and prayers goes out to Luther, his family and all the Luther fans out there!God Bless you all!!Jeanine"
2,"Very basic, adds nothing that's not in the manual","I was very disappointed with this book and will be returning it.If you have spent a few minutes playing with Moodle and read even a little of the online manual, this book adds nothing new. The system is easy to figure out, as most items are pretty self-explanatory and each option has a handy pop-up help screen that explains anything that you don't understand. The online documentation is very good.I was hoping this book would explain how to do more advanced things in Moodle - how the many available add-on modules work and what they contribute to a finished system, tips and tricks to add videos and flash files to your courses, best practices for course development, advanced customizing, etc. But there was none of that in the book - only the same information that is already included free with Moodle. Save your money!"
5,Excellent resource,"An excellent introduction to Moodle -- a course management system I'm teaching myself. Yes, much of the information is available online at the Moodle site, but I'm a person who would rather look through a book as opposed to clicking links online and printing what I require."
5,Thank you for this terrific book,"Thank you to the authors of Using Moodle! This comprehensive introduction to Moodle is exactly what we needed in my school district. I recommend it to anyone charged with Moodle-related staff development.Well-done, Fellow Moodlers."
4,Using Moodle,This is an excellent book and makes it very easy to use the Moodle program. My only criticism is that I would have liked at least a little information on how to set up Moodle when you are using the program individually rather than through a company or university network.I would definitely recommend this book to others.
4,Moodle,"""Using Moodle"" helped get me understand the new program the college will be using and helped get it set up for the students and myself."
5,Bound manual for Moodle,"If your looking for the Moodle manual, and you want it bound, here it is. I find that handy, so i like it. I suppose it depends on whether you like reading stuff on line or not. If you like it bound then this is the way to go. That being said, I would have liked some more material on how to extend Moodle, and not just the straight walk through that is here."
4,Once again another great album,What can I say about Pieces of a Dream. Complete Excellence. Summer and No Assembly Required are a joy to listen too. This is a must purchase.
3,pretty damaged,"while the actual product was acceptable, the state leaves much to be desired. The box the dvds were packaged in showed u pretty torn and crumpled. will, I purchase from that seller again? I really dont think so. Unfortunate, but live and learn"
5,Everyone needs this book!,"This is a great book which discusses multiple intelligence theory and how you can use recent brain research on how people learn to help yourself become a fantastic teacher. Great resources and ideas, and it will help you stretch and reach those children who have seemed bored or out of touch!"
3,"high quality, poor accuracy","ibex makes some great luthier planes, the materials and finish are top notch. however, they tend to come with inaccurately ground blades on the curved bottom planes. I had to completely regrind the blade to match the sole contour. A minor adjustment is to be expected, but the last one was way off. after solving this problem at the grinding wheel and stones, the plane works beautifully."
5,"Focused More Upon Modern than Historic Jewish ""Radicalism""","A superb scan of theologically hard-right sects within modern Judaism, with a suprising focus on the situation in the NYC area and American religious Jews generally. The book could benefit from a fuller treatment of the Orthodox view toward Zionism in the pre-state period, but this area is in fact addressed fairly well. It is surely an essential volume in any collection pertaining to the history of Zionism."
5,The ultra- orthodox view of the modern state of Israel,"I read this work in the original in Hebrew. I was impressed by the depth of Ravitzky's knowledge of the ultra- orthodox world, and learned much about Haredi resistance to Zionism , a subject that had always perplexted me. And this because I praying daily the verse 'And return our eyes to Zion with mercy' always assumed that somehow to be religious meant to support a modern Jewish state in the land of Israel.As I know Ravitzky's political position and bias ( He is a left- of center religious Zionist, ) I have a certain reserve about his writing about Habad , who are in the other camp completely.But this is certainly a work worth reading, and even studying if one wishes to understand the variety of religious positions on the redemptive character and nature of the modern state of Israel."
5,Easing the fears to confidence,"When my fiancee and found out that our rental house is going to be demolished (2 weeks before our wedding), we decided to ""Try"" to buy a house. The first thing I did was buy this book. It has helped us realize that yes, we can afford it, how it may even be financially good for us! All of my fears about being uprooted were calmed, and as we read each chapter together each night I feel more and more confident about the process and pitfalls of finding and buying our very first home! This book has answered EVERY question we have had, and pointed out situations to watch for that would have otherwise been unknown to us. We're going to prove to all of our friends and family that we CAN do it, and that we did it ourselves (with the help of a little book)."
2,Waste,"This book is a waste of time, especially if you have anything complicated in your home-buying transaction (and who doesn't?). It's also sexist - they actually recommend that two people in a couple (because obviously anyone who is buying a house must be in a heterosexual relationship) go and read _men are from mars, women are from venus_. spare me."
5,KEM CD,"I think the cd is great. I love his music itz great, I especially love ""Find your way"" & I can't stop loving you""..I definatly encourage everyone 2 buy it."
5,Kem II [Dual Disc] is a double pleasure!,"If you are a huge fan of Kem this is a must have dual disc for the collection. The CD offers a close up look of Kem and how he views his music. The live performances are amazing. The video of ""Find your way back in my life"" offers a refreshing view of Kem actually acting and performing versus the live version of his past two videos."
1,I threw it away...,"I have never been as disappointed in a product for a child as this tunnel track. It was a nightmare to put together and never worked properly. It was a gift for a friend's grandson. After spending Christmas Day trying to assemble it, they brought it over to my house as nothing ever defeats me. I was so digusted that I got out a 33-gallon trash bag and threw it away; I was too mad to even pack it up and return it."
1,Frustrating,Sheer frustration to put together. The car (ONLY ONE SPECIAL CAR!) would'nt hold a charge for long enough to do one full lap. Now the charger part doesn't even rev up without some fiddling. I changed the 3 D batteries twice in a very short period before throwing this track in the garage.
2,VERY DISSAPOINTED!!,"I wish I had only paid the 14.99 for this item. I paid the outrageous price of 39.99! The last Hot Wheels track we got worked really well, so I had high hopes for this one! The cars NEVER stay on the tracks! It has gone around a maximum of three times and it always jumps the track! My son loves it when it works but is VERY frustrated!"
1,As new still in the box...,"I purchased this as a gift for my two nephews assuming I could easily purchase an additional Turbo Glo car (the set includes only one). After searching retail stores, Amazon, and even the Mattel Hot Wheels website I cannot locate a single car except through private sellers and priced more than what I paid for the set. I am extremely disappointed in this product. PLEASE avoid purchasing ANY Turbo Glo track sets if intended for family fun and pray that the car does not get eaten by the dog!!!!"
3,Fun for a little while,"Difficult to put together. Definitely needed an adult. Fun toy, but the car comes off the track quite often. Fun, but need to replace the car back on the track after a lap or two."
1,difficult and a waste of time and money,"This ""toy"" was difficult to put together, and extremely difficult to keep the cars on the track. As the cars kept leaving the track, we had to put obstructions around the track to keep the cars near."
1,The worst toy - last hotwheels item we will buy,"After two frustrating attempts trying to build this track, we are throwing this piece of junk in the garbage. The damned flappy plastic sheets are impossible to get into those stupid rings.I wish we had read the reviews before we bought this gift for our son. What a mistake."
1,What a piece of CRAP!,"I can't believe I paid $40 for this poor excuse for a race track. How can they get away with the commericals portraying this race track as the best race track ever. The tunnel set up was a real big pain in the ###. We managed to get the charger to work 4 times, with the car flipping off the track in the first corner every time. My grandson is so dissapointed, unfortunately he still believes everything he sees on TV."
3,Entertaining but not beter than Inhumans by Jenkins,"SPOILERS AHEADWell first part of the book is , basically, travel in Hulk's mind and it contains some psychological babble which I dont like in general.Second part is action and thrill packed and is much better suited to Hulk's persona.I read only Ground Zero and very old episodes so I might not be best person to ask for opinion about this book"
4,works!,"tricky at first. I thought it wasn't the right plug i ordered. Tight fit, don't give up, works..just plug it in and go ...."
1,Poorly written description -- it's actually DVI M to VGA F,"The description states that this converts from a female DVI port to a VGA receptacle. Reading that, I expect one end of the adapter to be DVI female and the other VGA female. Instead it is DVI male and VGA female.I'm sure it will work fine -- it's just not what I needed and isn't worth the return hassle."
5,One of the best thrash albumns of all time,"I don't go around giving out 5 stars to every band I like, but on the rare occasion, a CD earns it. Master of Puppets, Practice what you Preach, Thrash Zone....this is a classic, and NEEDS to be in your CD collection if you're into metal. The songs stand the test of time, and are just flawless. Trip at the Brain is one of the greatest first songs of all time. I won't analyze this cd, but just buy it."
2,Barely readable....Publish America drives another stake in the heart of 'Real Literature',"Just another example of 'PA's 'dumming down' of America. This might have actually been a decent novel (Vinson's 'Passports to Hell' is actually fine work), but the lack of even a passable copy edit makes it virtually unreadable. I take it by the publication date that this was one of the author's first published works. If I were him, I'd do my best to re-obtain the rights just to remove it from the market for a complete re-write. One story, 'The Revenge Squad', was actually enjoyable even in its present state, but could've used a sound 'chopping' of perhaps five-hundred words or more. Again, skip this and read the author's 'Passports to Hell' or the even more recent 'Half Past the Witching Hour' instead."
2,Kilroy was here,"If you're a student of WWII GI history, humor, or how the grunts coped with the rigors of Army life, you are advised to look elsewhere (anything by Ernie Pyle or Bill Mauldin for starters) among a host of others.Charles Osgood, whom I've enjoyed on CBS Sunday Morning and once in a blue moon on the radio, laid an egg in ""writing"" this one.It is a simplistic, puerile and badly done compilation gleaned from other sources of lackluster tidbits. While there are ocassional nuggets, they are awash in most of this little book meanderings about little.If you're interested in this book, go to the Public Libary, check it out and use the money saved to buy anything from Pyle or Mauldin."
2,Tepid humor edited by someone who should know better,"This book of humor lacked any of the bite that I would expect from veterans of the military bureaucracy so sharply satirized in ""Catch-22."" It's as if Osgood chose to reinforce the overblown portrayals of World War II veterans as demigods rather than as regular, vulgar, lusty, angry, scared humans. I've heard enough of Charles Osgood's work on the radio to know that he doesn't usually fear sacred cows, but he treats the vets and the war as such anyway. Hopefully, a future editor will explore a fuller range of humor from the war."
4,Pretty funny stuff!,"Osgood has sifted through the mountains of GI books and papers, such as ""Stars & Sripes"" and ""See Here, Private Hargrove,"" to find some of the funniest bits from WWII. There are the famous cartoons by Bill Mauldin, short pieces by celebrities, but most of all, humor written by the men at war.As Osgood says:""War is hell, but it can also be hilarious. And in no war was this more true than World War II. While there is nothing remotely funny about the war itself, it's clear that some of the hardship endured in that conflict was made more bearable by generous doses of humor."""
5,Great for a WWII Vet,"I gave this book to my cousin who was an Army hero during WWII. He had been in the hospital with a heart problem, and this book brightened his spirits. He told me he enjoyed the book very much and it brought back memories of some of the fun that went along with being a infantryman in 1944/45."
5,Simply a wonderful book...,"I read this book long ago, but it has stayed in my memory ever since. The premise of a girl slipping into a parallel universe is both exciting and frightening. Norma Fox Mazer has a true gift for eloquent description and believable fantasy. Kids will love the book, but I guarantee that adults will also be hard pressed not to read it again and again."
4,an good intro to teen fantasy,"I found this book second-hand, and my many readings of it haven't helped it's condition. Zan is a teenage girl trapped in an apartment with her extended family; she sleeps in the kitchen. After her brother reads her diary, she runs away and finds herself in another place. Zan is taken into a nearby tribe. The details of its culture are well-done, especially in regards to adulthood ceremonies and gender roles. Zan gets a more mature outlook on life, but her presence in the tribe causes trouble. After a serious incident, Zan suddenly finds herself back home on the same day but several hours after she left, even though it seems she to her she was gone for months. I was drawn to this book because I like fantasy, but it's more of a metaphor for teenage alienation issues and dealing with growing up."
5,Straight from the heart.,"If you have ever lost a loved one this book will read like your own secret prayers to God asking, ""Why?"". If you have ever lost a loved one this book will also help you come to peace with the answer. Tapestry is straight from the heart."
3,Better but not so earthshattering.,"I just finished readingTransmetropolitan Vol. 4: The New Scumand this is definitely better than that one. There's a lot more hope in this thing and Spider Jerusalem gets to do more than complain and whine. This might as well be called ""How Spider Got His Groove Back"" without the Jamaican muscle boys. The first story is abotu Spider getting involved in a free news service which preconfigures blogging but notes that Spider has plenty of money. There are assassinatin attempts but they fail.The second part is a series of vignettes about the more desperate members of society including child prostitutes and crazy people. There's a degree of pointed parody but a lot of it just feels like Ellis is reaching for a type of transcendence amidst the sorrow. Good stuff. Not great, but definitely worth a read or two. And the art is excellent."
4,Spider 7,"It seems like Ellis wanted to stretch out the story over by one book, because this one does very little to further the story. Don't get me wrong it was still what you would expect from Transmet, but it just wasn't as intense."
1,Increible que una empresa seria como Amazon venda esta basura,"Es increíble que esta basura difamatoria y antisemita siga en circulación, y en particular por medio de una empresa tan seria como Amazon.com.Este libro está escrito desde el más profundo odio por el prójimo, en particular contra el pueblo judío. Pero si al menos el escritor o escritores se dignaran a decirlo expresamente en el libro, al menos serían sinceros. Simplemente escriben una disparatada recopilación de mentiras absurdas acerca de un pueblo milenario y que merece el respeto de todos por su aporte a la humanidad en todos los ámbitos (cultura, social, valores, científico, etc).Espero que este tipo de publicaciones que lo único que logran es difundir odio sin fundamentos reales deje de circular, en particular por medios que hasta hoy me parecían serios."
3,CUTE BUT BORING,"I AGREE WITH SOME OTHER REVIEWS THAT WHILE THIS SET IS VERY ATTRACTIVE, IT IS BORING! THERE IS THE MAT THAT DOES TALK, THERE ARE PLENTY OF CUTE PLASTIC DURABLE ANIMALS, BUT THERE ARE ONLY A FEW PLACES FOR THE ANIMALS TO BE. ON THEIR LETTER, IN THE TREE, OR IN THE CAVE. I THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD HAVE SOME INTERACTIVE PHRASES, BUT IT REALLY JUST SAYS THE LETTER OR ANIMAL. AFTER YOU'VE SEEN THE ANIMALS AND HEARD THE LETTERS, THEN MY DAUGHTER IS DONE AND ONTO ANOTHER TOY. IT IS PUT UP RIGHT NOW AND I CAN'T REMEMBER THE LAST TIME IT WAS OUT."
4,Wonderfully versatile toy,"Our 2-1/2-year-old loves this - has been playing with it consistently since we got it for her 8 months ago. Emily LOVES animals, and she carries on conversations between the various animals. One of the best toys we have to stimulate imaginative play. While it can be a pain to keep track of all 26 animals, Emily will play with virtually any group of them anywhere. We've used them to get her to eat supper, as car toys, as toys to amuse her when we're visiting friends, in the bath tub, and on and on. What's been really fun is to go to our local zoo and watch her make the connections between her play animals and the real ones. I didn't know what an uriel was when I was 2! I agree with another reviewer that the structures leave something to be desired. Emily doesn't use them much. We also have the Fisher Price Animal Sounds Barn and the farm, and Emily will interchange the animals. I have to laugh when she has the lion and tiger being friends with her horses! Peace, man..."
3,Just OK as a toy,"We bought this toy for my 2 year old daughter when we realized she already knew most of her alphabet. She likes the waterfall and the tree but really has no interest in the mat. This toy gets some play but not nearly as much as the Little People doll house or the Little People ramps around garage. Interestingly, although she is addicted to the little plastic animal replicas, she really didn't show much interest in the animals in this set. If you want your kid to learn their letters and the sounds they make buy LeapFrog's ""Talking Letters Factory."" If you want your kid to enjoy hours of pretend play buy a different Little People set."
5,great toy,"My neice loves this toy. It is both fun and educational. My sister in law says that she plays it for hours, and she is only two and yet it can hold her attention for hours. She is starting to use the sounds to form words. It is definetly helping with her development."
4,Purchase NEW from fisher-price.com -- $48,Great item. Both of my children (1.5 and 2.5) love it! They will learn their letters as well as identify animals and their sounds! DO NOT PURCHASE from some over-priced store. This item can be purchased for it's original retail amount (between $40 and $50) right from the Fisher Price website. Shame on amazon for allowing such scamming to happen here. [...]
4,My kids love it!!,"I bought this set for my two daughters (1 and 2 yrs old) and they both love it and have played with nothing else since it arrived! The animals in the set are cute and colorful enough to entertain my 2yr old, but still durable enough to withstand my 1yr old's abuse. The only problem with the set, as other reviewers have said, is that there is not ""a home"" for every animal. My 2yr old has already gotten a bit frustrated that she cannot fit all of the animals in the zoo. I didn't have a problem with the mat laying flat as others have stated. Fortunately, the mat that came with my set laid flat right away. I'm very glad I purchased it because overall it is a wonderful toy with great educational value. I'm looking forward to purchasing more Little People sets...I have my eye on the house next!"
4,Nice birthday present,We got this for my grandson for his third birthday and he loves the little animals that come with it. It is a good purchase.
3,Love the toy need it in French,Please help me get this in French ......I've been looking for months where or how to get it shipped to us
1,BIG disappointment!!!,"We just purchased this zoo as a ""binky fairy"" gift for our 2yr old. We were happy to have found a zoo playset that came with so many different animals and that would be a learning tool as well, however, the toy doesn't work. Only three of the letters on the play mat make noise. Nothing else works even though we put in new batteries. Since Fisher Price is out of stock of this item we paid a much higher price to purchase it on Amazon. Extremely disappointed in Fisher Price and very upset that our poor little girl gave up her binky so bravely for a dud toy. I feel like Amazon should ship us a new playset before we have to return this one but I don't have faith in this toy anymore so I'm not sure I even want to give it a second chance."
1,A to Z Learning Zoo,"Received this as a gift for our 3 year old son. Only 3 of the letters make sounds...no other letter works.Tried changing batteries and am using hard surface...still nothing. It seems like it would be a good educational toy, but I am extremely disappointed with the quality at this point. Have emailed Customer Service @ Fisher Price and will update with news on service..."
2,bad contacts,We have had to return the electronic pad to Fisher Price. It will not reconize several of the animals or letters. Fisher Price was very nice handling this matter and we will see what the new one does.
2,Disappointed,"MY kids have almost all of the Little People playsets. I was excited about the Little Movers that came out and the Learning Zoo. The Little Movers are excellent but the Zoo is a big disappointment. It is poorly made. The mat never fully unfolded and there were big bumps in it. Also I tried two of them and the Z was WRONG! It said ""zed"" for the sound and zebra with a short e in stead of a long one. If they make a few adjustments it could be a great toy'"
3,Not that great for price,"For this toy being $40, it really isn't that great. The mat that your child gets to push the buttons comes folded in the box. When you unfold it, creases remain. You will push an animal and it will play the one next to it because of the crease. It should have been a bigger area to. I did really like how it came with a zipper bag for all the animals to be kept in. That is the biggest plus. :("
5,My 2 children love this toy!,"I have a 3 and a 4 year old, and both thoroughly enjoy this toy. I was worried about it being too ""young"" for them, but my son and daughter are animal enthusiasts and this toy is a jumping board for learning a lot about the different animals. I have never been disappointed by Fisher Price's Little People collections, and this is no different. I highly recommend- especially if you have animal lovers in the house!"
4,Great Toy,"My son loves Little People. This toy is worth the extra money because of the added educational value that the other LP toys don't have. Each animal has a letter which corresponds to the letter of the alphabet on the mat. Just like the Leapfrog Fridge Phonics, when you press the letter, you hear the name of the letter, the sound the letter makes and then a word beginning with that letter (the name of the animal). You can also hear the sound each animal makes. One big improvement is that FP FINALLY gives you a little zippered case to pack up all the animals instead of having LP animals all over the floor. My son loves to carry the case around with him. The ice waterfall and the tree are lots of fun and inspire my son's imagination. More pricey than other Little People sets, but this one is worth the extra $$."
5,"Um, this item is available for waaay less $","This toy is so great - just for the big bucket o' animals. They are the perfect shape, size, texture for little tot's hands. The play mat thingy is kind of crappy & stoopid . . . BUT this price is OUTRAGEOUS. It's available for HALF this amount on some other major retails sites. (Think big, obnoxious discount chain store) Check it out."
5,fun at the zoo,"Our grandson who is now 5 still enjoys this toy, and every other child that comes over for a visit enjoys it too.Holds up well, Love the case that comes with it to keep all the animals contained..."
5,A great learning toy,"I bought this toy for my daughter when she was 18 months old so that she could practice her alphabet. It has been a hit from day one. She is now nearly 3 and she plays with it with her 15 month old brother. She loves to hear the animal sounds and she loves to say the names of the animals while she matches up the animals to the letters on the mat. I wish the bird could be removed above the tire swing because that causes some frustration to my children, but other than that it is a great toy. It comes with a handy heavy clear plastic zippered bag to store all the animals in. The bag and its zipper have stood up to the test of time, so in durability it is a winner. It keeps their attention long enough for me to prepare a meal."
5,Easy toys!,She loves it and I did not have to leave the house. All is well! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
4,Cheaper on Fisher Price Website,This is a great learning tool that my 17 month old daughter has loved but the price is ridiculous through Amazon. It is listed here at $149 but on the Fisher Price web site it is only $43--that is over a hundred dollars less. I am very disappointed with Amazon for price gouging its customers on certain products. You definitely need to do your research before purchasing through them.
4,solid,"Don't be confuse by the picture, it only comes with one of this buss bars, they do what they supposto, Not a bad product.."
1,"Grandmother, what a bad movie this is.","This review is for the first short film on the disc, Little Red Riding Hood. I'm yet to watch the other short films.I bought this DVD thinking it would be a real treat - I love fairy tales and Christina Ricci is one of my favourite actresses. And when I say I love fairy tales, I'm not talking the butchered Disney versions. My shelves are lined with the original Grimm and Perrault, and I was really looking forward to the artistic rendition this film seemed to be.I was sadly disillusioned. Although 16 year old Christina was endearing in her silent Lolita-esque role, the rest of the film fell flat on its face. It tried to be artistic and sexy, but only came across as weird and stupid. The wolf was ridiculous. Parts of it were so bad I thought about giggling, but it wasn't even unintentionally funny enough to make me laugh.LAME."
2,Strange,It's a weird movie of a few short stories that don't really make much sence to me. I'm sure the weird arty ppl out there will appeciate it but I didn't.
2,Meh,"I looked everywhere for this movie, all other websites rated this DVD as incredibly good... but I was really disappointed... It's nothing really incredible or eve original. Its predictable and too short even for short stories."
2,Novice guide,"I was expecting actual technical information, instead I found this book to be just a vague guide that just pretty much tells you what products do and do not work. The small amount of actual advice may be helpful to a beginner.You can get the same advice for free from anyone that owns a Sportster and has tried to upgrade it.This may be a good guide for a novice Sportster/Buell owner, but if you have any kind of mechanical backround or even tinker with bikes on the weekends, I would suggest passing on this book."
3,hop-up guide review,"this wasn't a bad book, just outdated! should have said 86-03. NO rubbermount or buell xb and barely any 1200sport. we're halfway through 2008 and these were all signifigant changes in the sportster/buell line-ups. is probably still good enough for most readers. i just had specific questions on all 3 subjects mentioned that h-d and local shops could not answer for me and that's why i bought the book in the 1st place. oh-well."
3,"Surprisingly, Not So Great","I have all of the Ultra.Dance and Ultra.Trance albums, and of them all, I like this set the least. At first, I thought I might be suffering from Trance/Dance burnout or the ""first-listen syndrome"" (where a disc sounds weird the first time through but then grows on you), but unfortunately I don't think that's the case. There are a few good tracks, but overall, I found it boring. As a longtime buyer of the Ultra series, I was surprised to find this set has a ""going-thru-the-motions"" kind of a feel to it. Oh, well, maybe I'll like the next one better..."
3,A mixed bag,"Ok, I normally don't buy mainstream compilation releases because most of them sound to ""cookie-cutter"" for my tastes. After listening to a few samples, I decided to give this 2 CD set a try. Unfortunately its basically a tale of two halves. CD 1 on my opinion is pretty bad and cookie cutter to boot. Disc 2 was above average for the most part. Defitetly much more hints of house on CD 2."
1,Singled-out trash.,"With some of the most nonsensical lyrics ever written backed up by some horrid vocals we have the song 'Stupify'. And guess what? That's not even how you spell the word 'Stupefy'. Smooth move, guys. And as if it couldn't get any worse, they have live versions and edits of this horrible song. This is bad bad bad. I'd never even think once about buying this."
4,compilation of early Seventies Brazilian jazz,"from website:Quartin was a label started by producer Roberto Quartin set up with the sole objective of bringing together the new young up and coming musicians of the Rio scene of that era (1970 - 71). The music is a representation of that time, dark and moody, deep jazz, digging into the Latin influences of the region i.e. bossa and afro samba.What you have here are the highlights of the catalogue and some unissued tracks remastered and repackaged.Reviews:'A wonderful compilation of early Seventies Brazilian jazz.' The Independent.'An excellent album which selects tracks from the shortlived but hugely influential Rio based label'. Straight No Chaser======Many of the tracks feature tenor sax player Victor Assis Brasil.Info and soundclips at:[...]"
5,A Jammin' Good Time!,A great book with *all* the inside stuff on both Roller Derby and the new RollerJam. Come out of the closet Roller Derby/Jam fans this is for us all!
5,Grand Slam for a Roller fan!,"This book has it all, the history, the fun, the rumors put to rest. You read it and you can't put it down and it ends much too soon. The best book on Roller Derby by far. The pictures are really rare, and the story is told with humor. It is essential for the fan!! Has good info on the new Roller Jam and is well worth the hunt for it!"
2,years and years of OK,"I'm updating this review 2 years later. We haven't used the answering maching part in a long time, but we're still using the base and handsets with our Voip service. I thought they'd be in the trash by now, so I'm upgrading the phone from 2 stars to 3 just for longevity.Old review begins hereThe call quality and range are good, but if you want a decent digital answering machine you'll be disappointed. The unit allows you to check messages two or three different ways, but the sound quality stinks regardless."
1,"Nice to look at, not to listen to.","Very attractive phone . . . and that's about the nicest thing I can say. The handset audio quality is absolutely horrendous, worse than a cell phone, and much worse than a 5 year-old Uniden 900 MHz I was using. So much for progress. Sound quality is fine with the base, but who wants to be tethered by a phone line? Features are great (handset speakerphone, same configuration as Motorola cell phone) but not enough to recommend anything other than to avoid this phone like the plague."
2,EXPECTED MORE FOR THE COST,"THIS PHONE WAS NOT INEXPENSIVE AND I EXPECTED MORE FROM MOTOROLA. THE VOLUME ON THE EAR PIECE FADES IN AND OUT. BATTERY DOES NOT KEEP ITS CHARGE THAT LONG, SO YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO PUT IT ON THE HANDSET. THE FEATURES ARE COOL IF YOU ARE INTO DIFFERENT RING TONES AND DIFFERENT RING VOLUMES SET FOR TIMES OF THE DAY, WHICH CAME IN HANDY FOR ME WITH TWO SMALL CHILDREN. THE ANSWERING MACHINE IS OK AT BEST. I AM REALLY DISAPPOINTED AND SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO PRIOR REVIEWS. NOT MOTOROLAS BEST."
1,15% Restocking Fee,"This phone does not work for touch tone service UNLESS you have digital phone service. I have analog phone service and was unable to use long distance service that required touch tone signals. This phone only works on pulse dialing unless you have digital service. Dynadirect charged me a 15% restocking fee, even though I explained that this phone does not work on an analog line. Don't buy from Dynadirect unless you know your not going to return the item."
2,Poor sound quality,"We bought this phone after previous reviews indicated good sound quality. Out phone has very poor sound quality, both in the wireless handsets and in the answering machine playback. The setup is good with both the wireless and the wired handsets, but overall we are unhappy with the system."
2,poor sound quality,The other good reviews gave this phone 5 stars and claim good sound quality. I must have a bad phone since I can hardly understand anyone speaking through the cordless phone -- the corded handset sounds great. I did not have any wireless equipment running at the time. I plan to return the unit(s) ASAP!
2,Took it back.,Was very impressed by all of the features and functions (very similar to my Motorola cel phone). Was so disatisfied with the sound quality (like talking in a tin can) and also the answering machine playback would drop out throughout messages (from the base unit as well as handset).
2,A failed product,"I bought this phone for it's corded base unit, answering machine and cordless accessories phones.1. The corded handset on the base is hard to hang up in the right position.2. The answering machine garbles messages so badly they are unable to understand them. It records hang up calls, that can only be deleted during the brief time during play back. I bought another answering machine to substitute.3. It will not work for all touch tone services.4. When using a cordless handset it will turn on the speakerphone of another cordless handset."
3,Excellent button layout-poor battery retention,Bought from costco for 99$. Bought this phone because of execellent button layout both on hansset and corded unit.after having for 4 days found out that battery doesn't retain that long. other than that i love the pho ne with cool ring tonescompared this phone to uniden dct7488-2 which had too many buttons.
1,Don't waste your money!,"This movie sucks. The plot is stupid, the acting is amateurish and the one rape scene is so poorly done as to be comical. This is the kind of DVD WalMart sells ""two for $5.00."""
5,It just works,"Prompt delivery and perfect condition. This adapter works without problems.The only negitive is that I could have used a text hint about the release catch,but that was only a momentary glitch on an otherwise effortless install."
1,Not the product I needed.,"When looking for an adapter for an ADC monitor to a DVI output on the back of my Mac, this is what popped up in all my searches (even when I provided the female/male designation) and I bought it because everything pointed to being what I needed.Except it wasn't. I needed an ADC Female to DVI Male and this product is a ADC Female to DVI Female... so, naturally, when trying to connect my monitor to my Mac Tower, I got squat."
1,Doesn't work with Viewsonic monitors,"I suppose that this would be an OK piece of gear if you don't have a Viewsonic monitor, but if you do stay away from it. It does not work with the DVI connectors on the Viewsonic flat panel monitors. Instead you need to order the DVI II extractor from Dr. Bott. This is a major hit since Viewsonic is one of the larger and more popular monitor brands available."
1,It does not work with macs,"though advertised to make the connection between macs and an apple adc monitor, both ends are the same soit does not workif you're in this situation, you have little choice but to get apple's adapteralso the belkin adapter can be found for much less on the internet without the belkin name"
5,Early Perry material.,you essentially get the Eastwood rides again LP plus a smattering of great Perry tracks. All hard to find these days with the revival of Skinhead in the UK. A must have!
3,They Done Her Wrong,"On the whole this video is a entertaining look at the life and times of one of this century's most important women. My only points of contention are that there is misinformation as well as a lack of any real rare material presented. We've seen the movies, how about some of her television and radio appearances. Granted they did excerpt a couple of lines from the radio shows. I think this video could have been better researched and put together."
1,Suction cups don't stick,"No matter how I try mounting the hammock, the suction cups fall off the glass within a day or two. I unfortunately bought two hammocks at once, and have had the same problem with both. My bearded dragons like sitting on the hammocks, and don't seem traumatized from the repeated inevitable collapses. The suction cups look well-made, so maybe it's the humidity or something, but this product doesn't work for me."
3,"My lizard like it, but it isn't sturdy",My lizard loves it but the corner suction cup keeps falling off and sometimes it does it when he is laying on it and he falls. The suction cup comes detached from the fabric.
3,Not quite what I expected,"This hammock does not support the weight of my 1-year-old bearded dragon, and she's tiny for her age. I was able to switch it around so that she uses it to climb the side of her vivarium, but I still wish she could have used it to hang out in."
1,WARNING: Suction Cups Detach Easily from Hammock,"The mesh detached from the suction cups and our dragon fell off. She's fine, but I returned the hammock tonight. I like the idea, but this item is not constructed very securely."
2,need to purchase 2,Didnt state you need to buy to for it to be completed. More info wouldve been nice. Oh well !!
3,"lizards love them, but they always break","Our bearded dragons love these and we continue to buy replacements, but they always break. The suction cups rip out of the material, but what can you do? We use fishing line and repair them the best we can until we simply have to replace them with new ones. The company really needs to reinforce the products. The lizards love these items SO much that we have to keep replacing them!"
4,Pretty Good,Its pretty good. my dragon loves it but its not made well. the hammock isnt well attached to the suction cups so it starts to tear
4,Big boy loves it!!!!!!,"My year and a half old Chinese water dragon loves to chill out in his hammock. Going to have to get him another one!!!! I would have gave it 5 stars, but I did have the experience of it not sticking to the glass at first."
1,Disappointed,"I have purchased many of Warn products was disappointed to find when I received this item that the description of the item does not match the item very as it leads you to believe you are getting two units for the $55+ as listed as a kit and the picture shows two items, and only one light comes in the kit. I returned the item and looked for other lights."
2,Too cute for words,"Myers' earlier books were palatable, but this one pales badly. Magdalena has become not only cutesy but (gag) politically correct. I couldn't get past the fourth page.Myers comes off as a Diane Mott Davidson wannabe, and falls considerably short."
5,I Love Tamar,"I love everything that Tamar Myers writes. Her books are always good for a ton of laughs. I haven't actually made any of the recipes that are included but I love that they are there. I don't think the point is that everyone should love grits, but maybe there will be one or two recipes that you will enjoy. Why look for something to complain about. Especially something that has nothing to do with the story line. If you like Myers you should try Diane Mott Davidson. She is great also."
3,A starting point,"""A Dog Owner's Guide to Grooming Your Dog"" Is an excellent place to start if you are considering grooming your pet. However, it is not for someone wanting to go into the business of Grooming. I was a little disappointed that my breed, the Shih Tzu, was not included."
5,In the top 5 of cd of 2005,"It's got it all cool tele's and Gretsch guitars,amazing harmonies, Great production and very very good songs and if you listen to the words the key to Eternal life JESUS!!!!!"
2,Not worth the time to watch it...,"I rarely give ""bad"" reviews, but this is one situation where I agree with the other reviews that this movie isn't a very good one. I, too, have enjoyed most of the Hallmark movies. This one, however, is an exception. My husband and I got through almost a half hour of it before turning it off. The plot was strange, and I, too, found myself not caring about the characters. The language, including the Lord's name in vain was also a turn-off, as was the personality of the main characters. Fortunately I just rented this DVD and didn't waste the money to buy it. If you want to watch a good movie, check out ""The Christmas Card"" or ""Clancy."""
3,Not very good...,"Hallmark rarely disappoints me, but this was one such moment. This film is not well constructed--nothing about it made me care about the characters or become engrossed in their struggles. If I had seen it first, I wouldn't have ordered it. Not a keeper."
2,Roughest Hallmark Film I've Ever Seen!,"Ok I liked this romance film. I would not call it a comedy,more like a drama.Anyway,I did not appreciate the preview on this DVD for the trashy, profanity-laced- ""Almost Heaven"" which even had the Lord's name in vain in the preview! I hope Hallmark has not ""sold out"" their standards.This film is nothing special. It definitely is not sugary sweet,and not really a passionate love here,but it's ok."
2,NOT A HALLMARK'S BEST,"IT COULD HAVE BEEN A BEAUTIFUL PRODUCCION, ANOTHER ""LOVE COMES SOFTLY"" OR ""THE TRAIL TO HOPE ROSE"", IT HAD A GOOD CHANCE AND ALL THE PROBABILITIES OF BEING ANOTHER HIT; INSTEAD, THIS MOVIE TURNED OUT SHALLOW AND JUST PLAIN BORING. THE CHARACTERS ARE NOT WELL DEVELOPED AND THE LOVE STORY FEELS FORCE. IT SEEMS US VIEWERS ARE JUST SUPPOSE TO TAKE THE FACT THEY FELL IN LOVE BECAUSE IT WAS THE POINT OF THE STORY, NO DEVELOPING EMOTIONS OR RELATIONS. I COULD NOT CARE ABOUT THE MAIN CHARACTERS, AND SHE JUST SEEMED LIKE SHE WAS TAKING ADVANCE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES EVEN ON THE LAST SCENE. tHE HERO SEEMED JUST IT NEED OF FEMALE COMPANY. OBVIOUSLY THE WHOLE THING WAS A BIG WASTE OF TIME"
4,mail order bride,"I bought the movie just because I saw that one of the horses looked just like mine when I watched part of the movie on the Hallmark Channel. When I got to watch the whole movie, I decided that it had a pretty good plot, nice, scenery, beautiful horses, and a good ending. The extras were also very interesting. I watched all of the extras. I really enjoyed the whole DVD."
1,Hallmark Misses the Mark,"Hallmark movies are usually associated with clean, respectable family movies. This movie sorely missed the mark. There was a ridiculous amount of cleavage, cursing, gambling, intense shooting scenes, innuedos and a highly inappropriate scene where he helps her onto her horse. This is NOT a family film. Wondering should I even bother with Hallmark again?"
4,Okay movie.,"This movie is not one of my favorites & I usually like the ""girly"" movies but this pushes reality just a tad."
2,Pathetic,"Honestly, how boring can you get! This is honestly one of the worst movies I've invested in. A complete waste of time and money."
4,Entertaining Hallmark Movie,Same title of a book I recently read but different story line. Entertaining movie enjoyed watching with my sweet wife.
2,Mail order Bride,I recieved my packaged movie was stuck to envalope their was a dent in bottom of case may be better packaging material should have been used.
5,Excellent Book!,"This is one of the easiest and most informative books to read on soccer! I especially liked the photographs that enhance and support the text. My kids have a copy at home, and I kept one for the office! PS. This is not a paperback cover as listed, but rather a very attractive color cover with Diego Maradona dribbling away!"
2,"Pretty pictures, lame book.","One of those classes you don't want to take. I didn't like the book, but it has some good pictures. haha"
1,Textbooks...,"This book was the required text for my Humanities class this semester; and may I say that it is a waste of money, time and effort. A more superficial text could not have been willfully created; and at $150.00 new/$80.00 used you are better off dropping the class if you can.If you are interested in the culture and history of ancient civilizations read anything but this book."
3,culture and values,I had purchased this item and it was not what I thought it was which was partially my fault. I returned the item and fallowed all proper procedures in doing so. The only grip I really have is it took several months and many reminder e-mails to the sender before I received my refund.
3,Works but is it just me or is the image shakey?,"My PS3 would show no signal when using a long HDMI connection to my projector, but I connected this and now it works...however it seems to me as though the image is shaking really fast on the screen..."
5,Works Flawlessly,"I bought 2 of these products 1 for myself and 1 for a customer due to the lenth of the cable being 50ft. Without the extender the picture was snowy, with it it was perfect 1080p. Only thing i can say is besure to install it properly it does have an in and an out and it makes a difference."
1,DID NOT WORK,THIS ITEM WAS RETURNED IT DID NOT WORK I EVEN CALLED COMPANY DIRECT AND THE SAID IT WOULD WORKFOR SURE AND NOTHING. DONT BUY WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY
1,DIdn't Work,Don't Buy This Item. It didn't work. I had a 55ft HDMI Cable and the signal was intermittent and booster worked occasionally but never 100%.
2,Only kinda works,Every few minutes (sometimes seconds) there is a 'flash' where the entire screen goes white for half a second. Its really annoying. Other than that it works. This annoyed me so much that I had to buy another signal booster.
1,signal booster,"It does not do what it is advertised for my circumstances. I wanted to boost a signal trnsmitted through a long HDMI cable, but it did not do it"
1,Did not work at all,"This ""booster"" did not work for me at all. I have a long (50ft) HDMI cable to my TV and noticed some noise in the picture. I purchased this to see if it would eliminate the problem. With this booster installed I lost the picture completely. It says to install it on the TV end, which I did, but it would not work. I tried it on the other end, just to see if that would work, but still no luck. I tried a more expensive unit for Xantech that did not work either. Thank God for Amazon's amazing return policy!"
5,This little thing works GREAT!,"After trying many other ways to get an HDMI to my bedroom tv (direct line, wireless HDMI wifi) for cable tv and a PS3, I thought I would give this a try. The price was right that is for sure. I have to admit I was skeptical after trying some much more expensive items. I recived the booster in a very timely manner thanks to my Prime Membership, just two days after I ordered it. I did a very quick install, about 5 min and whalaa full perfect HDMI signal! I guess Occam's Law it true! The simplest answers is always the best!! get this and enjoy!!"
1,Didn't work,"I was hopeful that this would help with boosting the signal from my receiver to my tv so I could get full 1080p, but signal got worse when I put the extender on vs. using no extender. Not sure if my unit is defective or not, but it only made things worse."
3,"Good preparation tool, but very long and boring","This book seems good to those providing counseling, but is a book that the couple being counseled will not enjoy. Many of the exercises are repetitive and lengthily; some don't even make sense. Don't get this book unless your counselor tells you to, it would be hard for a couple to motivate themselves to finish this book on their own."
5,Very Good Preparation Material,"Updated review Feb. 2013: Why is this book listed to be over $100? When I first purchased this workbook in January 2007 from Amazon, it was less than $11. I don't get it?!! My advice: Search the net thoroughly before purchasing this resource at any price higher than $20 US dollars!!!Here's the skinny. Overall it's a good resource. Tedious, but good. Some of the material is a wee bit outdated, and doesn't address, head-on, some of today's challenges. Moreover, if your betrothed doesn't get his or her own book and doesn't participate in working on the lessons, then that's a BIG RED FLAG and don't take that lightly."
5,Great Resource,My fiance' and I learned so much from this book. It is definitely a great resource for couples preparing for marriage. It has allowed us to have good discussions about topics we never would have known was important to talk about! We loved it so much we plan to bless other couples with it as they get engaged.
5,Great for people getting ready for marriage,It brings up a lot of topics and starts your life out the way it should be and you get help and ideas talking about topics that might otherwise be more difficult.
5,Excellent way to prepare for marriage,My daughter used this as a guide in her church classes b/4 getting married. She seemed to enjoy it alot.
5,GMF,It was in great condition and came in a timely fashion. I will most certainly use this book and recommend others to do the same.
4,WOW ... Good Prep Book B4 Marriage,"At first it looked very repetitive ... but, found that there was a reason for it ONCE you go thru ALL the book first - Good Job."
5,"Love this Book, So helpful!",I'm currently going through this book in marriage counseling w/ my fiance' and we love it! It is so helpful. It goes into such great detail and guides you biblically through specific topics that are great to discuss before marriage. I'm sure we'll be referring back to it even after we're married.
4,Love the rainbow!,"My daughter, 14 months old, LOVES this book! I actually have it memorized at this point. She loves to see all the Sesame St. characters and then discovering the rainbow at the end every night."
3,Interesting concept,"The book is a nice book, althoug the way it presents the drawings and the colors it is a little confusing for toddlers; also it is not a cardboard book, so pages are difficult to go trough."
3,"ok, not the best","this book is cute for older toddlers (3,4) but for my 18-month-old, it just wasn't clear enough. the colors were sort of washed out and faded-looking. however, i'm sure a 3 or 4-year-old would enjoy the cute poems!"
1,There's no content...,"Please be aware this book is only a joke - all the pages of the book are completely blank - that's right, blank. Only buy this book as a novelty. I returned my copy."
4,a very useful,"It's a very useful product, beatiful, easy to take in the bag of the women and in addition it protiles the USB"
5,Page turning WWII story that has a gripping plot,"I read the book and saw the movie at a film festival. The book is a real page turner historical fiction but was actually based on true events. Without ruining the plot, it is about a few soldiers who survivied a slaughter of POW's by the German's and their journey through enemy lines to get back to the American side. This takes place during the Battle of the Bulge and the men have a mission not only to survive but to relay very important intelligence that could have a significant impact on the battle. I enjoyed this book so much that I purchased a copies for my father, brothers and co-worker who is a WWII buff. I promise you won't be disappointed."
3,An okay World War Two book,This book was okay. It had an alright plot. I would suggest it for almost anyone who likes a good book. The one thing that made it not as good was that the book keeps skiping from one person to another completely different person.
1,"Jeffrey, don't quit your day job","I hope Jeffrey Scott hasn't given up his day job as an attorney, he has a long way to go to catch up with Grisham. This book will never be mistaken for literature. It is an amateruish attempt to create a book from a screen play. Did anyone proofread this book? I found a lot of typos, which immediately makes me wonder about desire to get it to market to take advantage of the film. I am sure the movie is better than the book, even though I haven't seen it. I was tempted several times to quit reading the book...only my curiosity as to its outcome made me finish it, and even the finish was so poorly done, it leaves you sitting there with bubbles over your head. Go see the movie (if you so choose) but don't waste your money on the book."
2,Falls short,"While I must say that the artwork in this collection is among my favorite styles from any DC period, I felt that writing fell well short of excellent. Sometimes confusing, which is the worst crime for me in comics, this series has a decent plot that could have been told much better than it was."
2,Graphic SF Reader,"The Justice League have a bit of a disagreement, and one bunch decides they need to get their hands a little dirtier.This group is led by one of the Elite from an earlier storyline. However, given that storyline was a commentary on the Authority et. al., the JLA having their own version of Stormwatch Black is not really believable. Particularly with Flash and Green Arrow in there, the non-lethal approach will cause conflict, as you know there will be no brain splattering punches a la Jack Hawksmoor."
1,"Graphic Novel, A.D.D. style (re-read 5/10)","I normally am very understanding of what one can expect from a super-hero Graphic Novel, but this one i think it beyond help. The editing of the story is horrible, the dialogue is very choppy, gramatically incorrect (and incoherent), and one has to re-read each chapter multiple times to understand what is going on. It is difficult to understand who is doing what, when it is happening, and you'd better make use of your score card unless you know everything about every super hero in the DC universe. This book might be perfect for people that have an intimate understanding of the JLA universe, but it is definitely not for someone picking it up off the shelf.Re-readability: 5/10*I always put re-readability in my reviews for people who like to keep their TPB to re-read. Something can be awesome, but not something I am going to frequenty re-read (Maus), or it can be horrible, but I might still re-read it (JLA).*"
2,Not worth your money....,"I recently purchased Archives from ebay for only 150 dollars. I am not a big fan of Yngwie but I wanted to see what the hype was all about. The box set lacks diversity. You can hear 2 cd's and not bother about the rest of them because he does the same thing over and over. He's a good guitarist, but I think this box set was overdone. The price is also a lot! imagine 8 cd's + 2 dvd's for 361.00! 8 cd's you can purchase used for around 10.00 and 2 dvd's for around 40.00...that makes it 120.00$ Whats the silver chain used for....who wants that unless u are one of Yngwie's family member. This is a huge investment so think and buy."
3,"5 stars for technical brilliance, 2 stars for musicality","Jeff Beck is definately one of the greatest guitar gods ever, and he definately proves this here his riffs are hard hitting and his solos are fast and brilliant. However, one thing this album does not succeed in is giving a musical experience. Most of the songs are hard rocking but steady giving a heavy load kind of feel and the softer songs are less spectacular because of the mechanical keyboad ""orchestras"" backing jeff up.Amazing playing, but if you want a musical experience check out Blow by Blow or Wired"
2,Not one of Jeff Beck's best,"After having this cd for nearly a year, I have determined that it just isn't very good. Beck's guitar playing is good, but I don't like the tone on this record. And I have always heard what a great drummer Bozzio is, but I assume that is not based on this material. Also, despite what fans of this cd think, it DOES sound overproduced. It just sounds like way too much effort was put in to make it sound just right and the music suffers for it. Also, several songs are ruined by that annoying talking. Don't get me wrong. I think Jeff Beck is one of the greatest rock guitarists I have ever heard, but this is not one of his best. I prefer Blow By Blow, Wired and Who Else and would recommend those long before this."
3,Crazy Fast Tunes,"Yep, crazy fast tunes with nutty lyrics. There are several on this disc that I mixed with a couple of similar tunes from other Beck albums to get a really great playlist for high speed driving. This is definitely not Beck's best stuff; much different than most of his other work. But it's worth a listen. Easy to get a speeding ticket playing this CD in a fast car."
5,Every song rocks!,"This is definatley one of Beck's best albums. Before I go on, let's clarify that. Jeff Beck's best albums, IMHO, are: Blow by Blow, Wired, Guitar Shop, and You Had It Coming.Like on Jeff's new release, You Had It Coming, he serves us with some raw guitar with funky beats and great stuff to listen to. It's great to listen to in the car. As always, Jeff's solos are timeless on this album. Where Were You is worth the price of the album alone. It's Guitar Shop's 'how did he do that!' song.As with all Beck releases, his genius and emotion are served at great amounts. Savoy, Stand on It, Big Block....they are all great songs. As said before, Where Were You is the standout. A Day in the House is REALLY fun to listen to, it's really funky and portray's Jeff's humour as well. It's a great album."
5,Great CD,"This is a great cd. Better than Wired, better than Blow by Blow, almost as good as Who Else. Bozzio is, as always inspired, and Jeff, as always, plays from the heart with the best technique on the planet, ever. Buy this."
5,Nice,Great to see this one re-issued and on what is a very clear and well mastered vinyl version. If you are a Beck fan you know this is a great album so this is just a note that the vinly is great!
3,great beck guitar work but overproduced,"although the material here is good and beck palys his best all the best part of a jeff beck project are lost in the glossy slick overproduction here. although I prefer blow by blow and wired and his earlier straight rock works, this is still worth your while."
1,Blech,"I'm cracking up at reading a review that calls this a ""timeless masterpiece."" Gawd...no offense, but groupies drive me nuts.You HAVE to be kidding me. As I said in an earlier review of Beck: it's been said that when he's good, he's very good; when bad, very bad. Folks, this is bad. Not his worst, but bad. It pains me to say that, but it's true. DON'T waste your money on this."
2,Not the best JB,"I cannot agree with previous reviewers that this cd is in the same class as ""Blow By Blow"" or ""Wired"". Sorry, Jeff, this is lame. Sometimes you just need to know when to hang up the axe."
1,Not what I expected !!!!,"I was very disappointed with this CD. It is a commercial CD at best, in my opinion. With the big name musicians, and reputations to match, I was very disappointed. It is a CD that's geared to a classic-rock minded listener who thinks what you hear on the radio is all that exists. It's boring, and simple."
2,Ear Pollution,"Being new to Jeff Beck's music (Crossroads '07 video found me wanting to know more) and after listening to ""Blow By Blow"" and ""Wired,"" I found this recording to very unredeeming. Over-Produced to the max. It kinda sounds what a ""garage"" would look like. There are some great moments, but too few. The rip-off of Zappa is very apparent, but Zappa it ain't. One listening is enough."
1,Not yer daddy's Jeff Beck album,"When this album came out, there was a great deal of hype surrounding it. I (being a huge Beck fan and mindful of his highly under-appreciated ""There and Back"") bought the hype.Sadly, I also bought the album. No, it's not as absurdly bad as works like ""Flash,"" but it's up there (or should I say ""down there""). That's the thing about Beck: when he's on, he's the best. But when he's bad....phew.......Another reviewer said it best in that this sounds like someone doing a cheap imitation of Beck. Save your money."
5,"Jeff Beck - Excellent, As Always","If you have never listened to Jeff Beck...this is a great starter. Always cosistently inspired in his playing, here, as always, he shows that his chops are completely present and accounted for in any style and genre. Beck treats his guitar as a voice, and all of his playing announces that touch. Everything in it is something excellent and well-crafted -- hard and tight rock to funny, then to heartbreakingly beautiful. And for the hot tip... if you have not heard or seen his ""Live at Ronnie Scott's""...don't ask questions, just reach for your wallet."
4,Another gem from the the Dalai Lama of the guitar!,"You can't go wrong with a trio as versatile and talented as Beck, Bozzio and Hymas. ""Behind the veil"" is worth the price of admission alone. Also ""Savoy"" and ""Two Rivers"". Let's face it. This guy is the best. Noel Redding (Hendrix's late bassist) confessed in an interview that Beck was his favorite. Heck, you needn't interview me for me to say the same. My favorite album of his is ""You had it coming"". If you're in doubt, go with that CD. And do consider ""Who else"". In my opinion ""You had it coming"" is his best. Oops, did I neglect to mention ""Blow by blow"" and ""Beck-Ola""? Excellent illustrations of his outstanding talent."
4,A good book for residential wiring,"Wiring a house involves two basic tasks; designing the system, and then doing the work. Most electrical books concentrate on teaching you how to do the work, and ignore the overall design, or layout of the electrical system. If you're re-wiring a house, or starting from scratch, you need this book. This book references the National Electric Code extensively, so you know you're following the latest approved practices."
1,Hideous,Without question this is the worst version of Hamlet I have ever seen. I bought a used dvd of the production and was so disgusted with the performances I wanted to throw it away. On an episode of Frasier - Dereck Jacobi did a parodoy of himself playing Hamlet. I now think the parody was intended to mock his poor acting in this play. The screaming and yelling of the stage actors to make up for a lack of sincerity and proper editing one would find in a movie only made me angry. The direction was absolutely terrible. The play appears to be a work of high school students and not professionals.
4,Great for little readers!,"These books along w/the Disney Storyreader is the perfect solution for kids who cannot yet read, but love to be read to. I purchased these books for my daughter and she has listened to them so much that she has memorized most of the pages in the books. People actually think she can read and she is only 3 years old!Books are the best gifts you can give your child and with these, if you're really needing to do some chores around the house, you have a substitute that can kinda take your place and read to your chid! Love these Books!!!"
3,Somewhat confusing,"I have read all of Paul Lindsay's books and this by far was my least favorite. I was having trouble keeping the names straight within the Mob family. I also didn't care for the way he bounced around the storylines. It seemed like I was having to go back to often to see who was who. There wasnt as much action and funny lines in this book as all the others. I was looking forward to much more interaction between the Detectives. I loved Witness to the Truth, and was hoping, The Big Scam would rate up there with that one. Overall, I was bored with this one.I am looking forward to his next book tho.Evelyn"
2,Clarifying Harlan Ellison's Role,"Just noting that Harlan Ellison did not ""ghostwrite"" this show: he created it; things went horribly, horribly wrong; and then he took his name off it and used his standard Writer's Guild pseudonym ""Cordwainer Bird.""He did write the pilot, ""Phoenix Without Ashes,"" but again, without his name attached, as he couldn't stomach what was done to his original teleplay.You can find the whole story of his experience with ""The Starlost"" in his essay ""Somehow, I Don't Think We're in Kansas, Toto,"" which you can find in his book ""Stalking the Nightmare,"" available through Amazon."
3,The hour cometh!,"The hour cometh by Howard B Rand is a book about the return of Christ. So primarily it deals with the Olivet prophecies. I have read almost every book Howard Rand has written, and had avoided this one because it was cheap in price. Now that I have read it I can definitely say that it was worth the price of 94 cents. In retrospect I probably would have paid around 5 bucks for it now knowing what I know. I will also add this little tidbit; I feel Howard Rand is underrated for his books."
5,"Two hooves up, WAY up!","A MUST-HAVE for horse lovers! When I first picked it up, I thought, oh geez, more girly horse-stuff....WRONG! Never have I read such great horse fiction! Most of the authors are actually knowledgeable about horses, which is definitely a plus! Some stories are even better than the Black Stallion. Most reccomended stories: ""The Most Magical Thing About Rachel""(the author should do a full-length novel of this one!), ""When Lightning Strikes"", and ""Riding the Nightmare""(altho' the ending is a tad cheesy:-)."
3,Unimpressive,"I read this book because of its reputation. In fact, I went so far as to buy the entire series (used) without reading a single page beforehand. When it first came out in the 1970's, this series really made waves. Now, it is good reading material, but not remarkable. Dedicated fans of fantasy will want to read it, but more out of historical interest than anything else."
5,Great Album,This is an album equal to Kings And Queens. The title song Mystica and The Curse Of The Damned being the two best songs. All Axel Rudi Pell albums are very good. And this one is one of the best. I wish more people would have heard of this guy. The only way I heard him was on the DIO tribute album. After that I started buying A.R.P. CD's.
1,Worst Written Book on Digestion Ever,"It's hard to even get to the content of this book because it is written so poorly. There is no index and no rhyme or reason to the order of the book. The ghost writer has advanced degrees from Stanford (or somesuch) and apparently has never written a book before this vanity effort.The content is so so at best. The author has no formal education in biology or medicine and wants everyone to eat raw, rotten cabbage. Beyond that, she seems to buy into the blood type diet just to have a hook into modern bad science.All in all, save your money and get a good nutrition book from the library."
4,A new viewpoint in diet/nutrition,"The Body Ecology Diet is not really a diet but a way of living. Some other popular theories--eating for your bloodtype and food combining are part of this plan, but there is a much needed emphasis on the digestive process. The book is technical, at times, but the information is very useful."
2,Husband didn't care for it,"My husband did not like the pleasure plus. It does have a little more room, which was needed, but he says it's too thick."
4,Wow! These guys are great!,"All I can say is ""try it, you'll like it"". These guys span the dial. They can bring back fond memories of the late 60's or bring you right up to date with what's happening now. The lead singer is phenomenal. The songs are fresh and provoke thought and the music is pure rock and roll. This album should appeal to all of theose folks between the age of 10 to 60 and maybe beyone. Give it a spin. You won't regret the time spent and I can almost guarantee that you'll be playing it over and over, and as a bonus you'll be singing along."
2,Junk,"This knife is pretty much a piece of junk. The build quality is very weak as the blade is held to the shoddy plastic handle by a single bolt. You will not be able to use this knife for very long for anything but light cutting. DO NOT USE IT IN ANY SURVIVAL SITUATION.I would not trust the blade for cutting any type of food either. Who knows what is actually in it. When I received mine it was all oxidized and had strange squiggly marks all over the blade. I scrubbed it down with WD-40, which made the blade a lot cleaner, but it's still really ugly. Who knows if there's lead in the blade or something. It strangely feels warmer to the touch than my stainless steel knives do. Do not trust it.The sheath is also a piece of junk.The only reason I gave this blade 2 stars instead of 1 is that the blade is very sharp as advertised."
1,garbage,"Unless your a girl scout on your first camping trip, this knife wont do to much for you. Made in Tiawan. Boldly crappy.. whoever said they owned this since they were a boy scout must have been in the fairy troop.Its not far off from the knives that can be obtained for three dollars at your local farmers market."
5,Awesome Hiking Knife,"This knife is durable, lightweight, and long lasting - I have owned mine for 17+ years since I was a boy scout. I would recommend."
5,excentric finnish music,"Well you just got to love this group. The main idea is not the music but translation of well-known rocksongs of Billy Idol, Motorhead, Midnight oil etc. The music of Eläkeläiset is a mixture of finnish dancemusic humppa, tango etc. They can play well but you should see them live and just enjoy their energy. If you don't speak finnish you won't understand much, but that doesn't stop people lovin'them abroad, Germany is one good exampleof that. Buy it for fun and try to find out the original songs..."
4,Gilmour speay doc sprayer repair kit,A little slow in shipping but the product was what I needed and works well
3,Miscommunication.,"I ordered the part because I was informed that it would fit all of the products. When I got the product, it was not the right part. I wanted the valve in the wand, but got a relief valve for the inside. After review and contact with the company, I was shipped a duplicate. Finally I got through to the company to find out that they do not handle this part. I was given the address of the manufacturer and they shipped the right part to me. I then sent the other two back and received credit. I am now OK, but it took some time and special effort to get the right part."
5,Parts,This product was a replacement part for a tank sprayer. From order to receipt it arrived in both timely and perfect order. There were no problems with the installation and it works fine.
2,Ehh...,It looks cool! But it's not what i was looking for. Even going easy with it is leaves you with a stinging pain.
3,You get what you pay for.,"The ""Cat of Nine Tails"" should have nine tails, right? Mine only had eight. LOLI'm not overly impressed with it even as a prop, but, hey, it was only a buck and a half. You get what you pay for.It would make a good gag gift for a kinky friend."
4,Not quite what I expected,"Although this is a good product, the leathers strips on the whip aren't like they are in the photo advertising the product. They aren't frayed or tied into knots at all, but still glad I bought it."
5,Small and cute!,I love this item!This item is small but good quality. Great for playing and such. Not so much for real punishment though.
3,Fun but nasty,"The leather is very hard. So if your a beginner this might not be for you. It's fun if the person using it is gental. It CAN hurt if used to hard. Good luck, enjoy."
3,Too Thick,The whip leather is very thick and the handle is too large for small hands to grip. Definitely not what I expected.
3,"Product took forever to come in the mail, and wasn't in good condition","I ordered this as a late present for my girlfriend and didn't receive it until almost a month after the order date, then when it arrived it was not properly packaged, just shoved in an envelope and was stiff and hard and not in good condition.when it arrived its tails were hard and bent, and the ends were coking undone.the only thing in decent condition was the handle binding.They should have been more descriptive on the products current state.This whip needs a lot of love to come back to life"
1,Smells horrible!!!,"I bought this as a gag gift for my friends wedding shower, this product smells horrible, I even hung it outside to air it out. It still stinks!!! Also the handle is badly made.All the way around, bad product!"
3,"its okay for the price, but not the best","The whip started to untwine from the top and started coming apart already and I haven't even used it. Its ok for the price, I can probably glue it back but It could have lasted a little longer than a couple of hours."
5,Item arrived fast and isgood quality,Item arrived fast and isgood quality but you do need to break it in a bit to get it to work and feelgood
1,Cheap is not always good,"I know it looked like a cheap price, but there is no price low enough for an item of this poor quality. The feeling of the nine tales is very similar to that of hay. I would never use this for anything more than a prop. Just look at the image very closely and you can see the quality."
3,cat of 9,"Item showed up ahead of schedule..lot bigger than I expected but definitely worth it! Haven't tried it out yet, but can't wait!!"
3,it's big!,"Item is much larger than I expected--handle is about 1 foot long, braids about 18 inches. It has a hard plasticy feel to it, somewhat scratchy. That being said it's still fun to play with ;)Great for the price"
3,Flimsy material but still fun,"I must admit, before I placed the order I was expecting a better quality material but then again I didn't pay much for the item so I guess you get what you pay for... The whip is a crappy leather material but it is still definitely usable! My boyfriend and I try to look past the poor material and just enjoy ourselves when we do use it. Needless to say, it still works and we still have a great time!"
2,if i was you,"I would only buy this as a prop. its painted and easy to come apart, i had to sew a few pieces back on."
2,"Cheap, but still not worth it.","If you're giving it as a gag gift, it's probably the cheapest one out there the way it's being marked down, but if you actually intend on using it, look elsewhere."
2,Not to thrilled,It came packaged badly and it broke easily not what I was expecting would not recommend this. I would try another option
5,OUCH,Sting like Hell !! Oh YES !!! I will be back for several more items in the near future. My arsenal is just getting interesting !
4,not my thing (yet),We have not used it but it looks well made and one day may be used in our play time
4,Good,"Good product for the price, great for a first flogger, entry level, enjoy using it, lightweight and easy to use"
2,It's Spray-painted black,"It's a very low-quality purchase, though considering I only got it for $5, I'm not sure what I was expecting. I wish I read the other reviews - they are rather accurate. Mine isn't bleeding black over everything like others have said, but it's still obviously just spray-painted black, giving it a rather stiff and very odd feel to it. I didn't pay much for it, but I'm still regretting this purchase."
2,Cheaply made,"This item seemed pretty cheaply made and smelled a bit strange. Also, was supposed to come with a eye mask that somehow got deleted off the order. A bed restraint was ordered and this whip and eye mask were supposed to come with it. Got shorted the eye mask."
1,Indiscipline,"I waited for this product about one month but didn''t arrive yetAltough appear rather.So, I hope to solve this problems and error.Thank u"
2,cheap - you get what you pay for.,"Small poorly made item. When I picked it up, I was pricked from one of the poorly installed tacks. The leather is stiff at time of delivery but by appearance alone, you can tell how the quality is low."
1,You get what you pay for,"As soon as i opened the box i knew i was going to be disappointed. The smell lofting out of the box was horrendous.When the kids were small one of their Halloween costume accessories was a whip, that our cats claimed as one of their kills. The cats tore it apart, and we had to throw it out. Thinking i could replace it with this product was a huge mistake.It smelled like cheep paint, and was confirmed as soon as I pulled it from the box. Little black paint flakes flew everywhere as soon as I touched it. I think this is made for looking at, not touching.You get what you pay for. I thought I was getting an inexpensive cat toy, it went from open box to the trash in about one minute."
1,Very cheap,This thing started falling apart when I took it out of the box. This is not a good buy. I would recommend spending a few more bucks a getting some thing of better quality
1,Cheap item - not even good for costume use,"I received this item as a gift and was amazed at the poor quality. As soon as I unpacked it the (very obvious) glue holding the wrapping around the handle let go and the wrapping began to unwind. I'm only glad that my gift giver didn't waste much money on this item. Although what was spent was wasted. Very, very shoddy work."
3,"For the Price,...","Reading the reviews after I purchased the Cat of nine tails I was getting nervous,. But really, when it arrived, yes it smelled a bit new and just finished, but the size and durability was perfect. I mean if you plan on whipping the hell outta your partner, don't get this. But as a first timer, I don't plan on leaving any marks on her, so it's absolutely perfect! GREAT deal for the price, it's $2 and some change people... SHEESH"
4,A NEW whip.,I appreciate the NEW whip that was sent in the place of the one that was damaged. The new whip is very good. I'm so happy that it arrived quickly and in excellent condition.Thank you.
2,"A relatively important band in Brazil, but...","Viper was a relatively important band in Brazil, one to gett some international acclaim and that toured even in Japan. But they had one dreadful characterictic: when playing live, they were some of the worse metal acts EVER!.Anyway, EVOLUTION was their last album of some merit. Afther that, the band evern stopped to sing in English and went on to sing in their native language, Portuguese."
5,VIPER evoution,"This album is realy amazing.Powerfull vocal with great gitars.Is it just great compilation.If you love melodic heavy metal like HELLOWEEN,GAMMA RAY,IRON MAIDEN...you must buy this album too."
3,"Predictable, but cute","A quick read. Not much of a plot, but a nice way to lose an afternoon. Fluffy, but fun. I enjoyed it."
5,Funny and light hearted!,Loved this. It was great to get into and forget the world around. So funny that I laughed out loud.
2,Not so great,"After finishing this book I went back to reread the reviews to see if I had down loaded the wrong book. I don't know where all the raves came from. I gave it 2 stars because I finished it, but I started skipping pages before I was half way through. I didn't miss out on any of the plot because it was so repetitive. The pacing was slow and the characters were caricatures. How many times can the fire race through you and you feel the electricity pulsating? It would have been okay as a short story with about 75% eliminated."
2,Someone else may enjoy this book,"Someone else may enjoy this book but it just was not my favorite type of writing. Contemporary fiction, perhaps? I didn't finish it."
3,Good for a mindless read,"This is a good book if you're not looking to get too drawn in. I prefer books with a little more depth, but it was a light, fun read."
5,A delicious comedy,"GET BUNNY LOVE is a hilarious story with good emotion and delicious characters, who couldn't be more different. Bunny is spontaneous and follows her whims, Nate is perfectly well-organized, disciplined, the strict executive who can't stand Bunny's antics. And yet, they have to work together. You'll laugh from the first page and won't be able to put this book down. Kathleen Long will keep you entertained with her smooth writing and a good dose of humor sprinkled with emotion. This book is another bestseller for Ms. Long."
1,Really bad book,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. Everything about it is just silly and so far from reality! The main character, Bunny Love, is just so annoying: her obsesion with 'new age' stuff is too much, she is a trouble magnet, she is invasive and she is clumpsy all the time, then when she 'hosts' the Dog event, out of the blue she becomes 'gracious'. Don't waste your time, it's not worth to read!"
1,Very Predictable!,"It is rare that I don't finish a book or skip through pages but, this book demanded it! It wasn't funny, it was so very obvious and predictable. There were a few entertaining moments in it but very few. I can't say that I won't try another book by the same Author. I'm just hoping that this was her fledgling effort."
3,It's okay,"The writing is tedious at times, and the story line is predictable, but it was worth the read. Good for a mindless beach read, not good if you are looking for something of substance (although you probably already knew that from the title)."
5,Brilliantly funny read,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Bunny Love is a wonderful heroine who wowed me with her zest for life (& for getting into trouble). Nate is charming and I was totally in love with him by the end of the story. This is a great, funny story that will have you laughing your pants off at Bunny and Nate's adventures. A definite keeper!"
4,Beach read,"This was a cute/funny book. What I'd call a beach read - simple and carefree. As with many of these style books, has a few items that you roll your eyes at, but overall, it's what I was looking for."
5,EXCELLENT!,"Grab a cup of coffee, turn the phone off and snuggle up (or into your bunny slippers) to enjoy this well written, funny, witty and charming book! I read it over the weekend, truly enjoyed it and LOL at many parts. Kathleen Long is already receiving tremendous acclaim and is on her way to becoming a top bestselling author. Looking forward to her next books arrival ""Silent Warning""."
3,Mindless romance,"I read this book in a few hours. It's cute and the main character is likable. There's nothing extraordinary here, but it's a cute, fun little romance that can fit the bill if you're looking for a beach read or the like."
5,Get Bunny Love,"Get Bunny Love is a great story with plenty of humor,some thing that is lackingin many books. I highly recommend this book to people who enjoy a good book with humoress situations"
3,"3.5 stars, PG-13 to mild ""R""","The main character was fun and original and the story was interesting. It's a light romance novel, with what you might expect from such.I don't recall there being a lot of foul language, but there is some sex."
5,Get Bunny Love,"If you want a comedic romance this is your book. I was in stitches the whole time, great characters Totally Zenn out Bunny and up tight Nathan will keep you hopping and Lord have mercy the dogs will drive you mad! The side romances in he story are great too."
4,Garage ambience,"This is *quite* good, although not as good as Budd will get later, especially with Eno. This CD is a compilation of two very early albums Budd did, and it is clear he is still finding his style. In part, that is what makes this so interesting. It sounds like he and a friend are in a garage, lost in the desert, making totally inprecedented music. Budd plays very spare, with lots of echo between the slow, rolling notes on his piano, with little to no accompaniment on most of The Serpent; on Abandoned Cities, however, he is joined by Gene Bowen, how provides ""ambient"" power chords on his guitar. Against the strange, distorted rumble of the Stratocaster, Budd provides melancholy, twinkling piano notes and runs. Fantastic stuff. Like an impending storm on a hot desert day, something you can feel but can't quite pin down--quiet now, but something's coming..."
2,Not for the Audiophiles,"Although it is great to remember these songs, I can only recommend this CD for listening while driving. With the windows open. Going atleast 55 mph.The sound is so compressed to be almost unlistenable in a quiet setting. Particularly, Mel Torme's Careless Hands is the worst. Not all the songs are affected, but enough to keep me from giving this more than two stars."
2,Sort of stunning,"One Eyed Man is a real shocker. A shocking disappointment, that is, for anyone who is a Hunters & Collectors/Mark Seymour fan. Considering how H&C were incapable of making anything but innovative, emotive music for two decades, it's hard to believe that it took Seymour four years to put out this gutless album. And Seymour already had a gorgeous solo album, King Without A Clue, under his belt. Some critics have described One Eyed Man as Seymour doing Crowded House. That's about dead on. There's a lot of sound, a lot of notes, but no hooks and no real songs. You wonder how anyone had the patience to labour over the flawless production of these flabby tunes. Seymour once seemed to have a bottomless well of lyrical wordplay and melody. It's a mystery how quickly it all dried up. Hopefully he was just distracted, trying to make a tribute album to his brother (Nick, ex-Crowded House) or something."
3,"""Don't take my word for it""","The album is decent. I prefer more ambient, chill jungle. This is a decent album, however if you are looking for moderate paced darker jungle without the cheese hype that artists like aphrodite uses. Peace out Ravers and definetly check out this album. Just because it is not my cup of tea doesn't mean it doesn't fit that bill for yo, ya know. Oh, and screw PLUR haha. Brought to you courtesy of K_Vandal@hotmail.com"
4,Works. Period.,"No frills. Just a USB hub with some card readers. Unfortunately, all of the drives for the cards appear in Vista, even though there is no card in the reader. The USB port on top is a nice touch."
2,It does not worth the name,It is full of mistakes in English and Oromo. Systematic Oromo spelling rule violation causes confusion. I don't understand how the author submits this work as a 'book'.
2,Desparately needs editing,"I bought this book shortly after it came out. I give it an 'A' for effort because the author really tried to create something useful. But due to so many mistakes in the English (and apparently the Oromo too!) it makes it not worth any money at all. Hopefully an entirely new edition, or new book even, will come out."
4,"Very, Very Cucumber","Where to begin? Method makes good dish soap. It cleans well and usually smells wonderful. The cucumber version is no exception. This soap offers a strong cucumber scent, one that smells very clean and fresh. It cleans just as well as any other dish soap I've ever used, so no worries about compromising cleaning power for environmental friendliness. My one reservation, and the reason I gave this product a 4 instead of a 5, is that the cucumber scent is sometimes so strong that it remains on my dishes, and I don't want to be smelling cucumber through my spaghetti sauce. This is the only scent with which I've had that problem. Otherwise, I'm very pleased, and I still use this stuff because I like the cucumber scent, even if it is too strong."
4,nice product,"I love Method products, and without having tried this one first, I bought a case! Now that I've been using it, I can say that it's a quality product, although honestly not as nice-smelling as I'd hoped. It does have a nice scent, but I got spoiled with how GOOD so many of their products smell I just played the odds. I'd still buy this again!"
1,Leaves soapy taste,Usually I really like Method products. This one was very disappointing. I washed a couple of water bottles and a bunch of pots with this soap. Now all of the water from the bottles tastes like the soap. They have been rinsed repeatedly and washed with a different soap. The Method Soap taste will not go away. The same is true for food cooked in the pots I washed. Vegetables taste like they were steamed in soap.
1,Never received this product and never been notified why.,I never received this product and never had explanation why we did not receive this product. I ordered and they went through. This is the only time that I never received the product after the purchase and no explanation was given. I will not order this from this vendor or think twice to order anything again.
4,Poems full of family and feeling,"Honeycutt's poems are honest and full of family. The poems are full of clairty and intimacy. The landscapes depicted in this collection mediate on the natural world and losses. The readers go with Honeycutt into this landscape she makes familar. Waiting For The Trout to Speak is a friendly, thoughtful collection."
5,Awesome story!,"I have read every one of Padgett's books, and enjoy them all tremendously. These are mystery stories written for literate, thoughtful people, and I can't understand why Padgett's books are so hard to get! Abigail Padgett is a thoughtful, lyrical author who assumes her readers will ""get it"" without spoonfeeding. I read this book ""out of sequence"", but am grateful to get my hands on anything this talented woman writes in any way I can."
5,I found a treasure in Paradise!!!!!!!!,This book is a real treasure!I began each story in this collection with eager anticipation and was never disappointed. Each is a gem. Finding a new author you love is always exciting and this is an author to watch. The book is a great gift as well! I bought several!
3,Uneven collection nevertheless has appeal,"I enjoyed Leegant'sWherever You Go: A Novel, for its loving look at modern Israelis, so I thought I'd give this collection a try. I was surprised to find it so uneven, with too many stories ending abruptly without any attempt at a resolution. The sudden introduction of fantasy in an otherwise realistic tale, as in Seekers In The Holy Land, could be disconcerting, though it worked well in The Tenth and The Lament of the Rabbi's Daughters. The slow-motion conversion of a Gentile drug addict/dealer in How To Comfort The Sick and Dying was especially convincing. And Henny's Wedding and the humorous Diviners of Desire, were neatly resolved. So I came away not as pleased as I was with the novel, but recommending this with reservations."
5,Intriguing!,"Excellent reading for diverse audiences - Engrossing, moving, and sparks the reader's curiosity!"
1,a week in Bakersfield,"I was very drawn to the notion of a collection of short stories with Jewish characters - since I am one myself. Unfortunately, and there is no kind way of saying this - this is a writer without talent - not a smidgen. She prattles, endlessly piling on pointless colorless details. She digresses, she's chummy, she's boring. The net effect is narcotic. It was a struggle to finish her tedious stories - and, to tell the truth, I finally gave up after reading several. If there is a gem in that collection, I missed it..This author says she teaches writing at Harvard. That is very unfortunate. She may have single handedly decimated a generation of writers by putting them to sleep.Pick up a book by Isaac Bashavis Singer or Phillip Roth or Norman Mailer if you want to read about Jewish characters... .... ""An Hour in Paradise"" was more like a week in Bakersfield.... with all due respect to Philadelphia."
5,Sandisk SD Card 1GB,Excellent price on this product. It is exactly the same product you would buy in any retail store but for much less money.
2,No keywords,"I bought this as a gift for someone to whom Shakespeare is of constant interest. Because of the Bartlett name I assumed it would be structured with keywords and cross references. Alas, it had neither, so it is impossible to find a quote by subject matter, which was one of the reasons she had wanted the book. The binding is handsome, however."
1,Waste of my money,I had never seen a lexicon without definitions of the words before. I have now. What a complete waste of money. Avoid this like the plague. It will probably be of little or no use to you as it was to me.
3,Could Make Your Teeth Hurt,"Expected desert blues a la Tinariwen, but this is mostly traditional Mauritanian a la Dimi Mint Abba. It was the debut cd for this Western Sahara group and principally consists of nonprofessional recordings. That's the chief obstacle to its success, despite the ""Fidelity be damned"" attitude of its annotator/producer. If you don't want Doueh's electric guitar to make your teeth hurt, turn the volume way down. Or better still, skip this disc and invest in one of the group's two subsequent releases, which I haven't heard but are bound to be an improvement."
1,overcoming thr enemy,"they kept my money and never sent the book i ordered, after i contacted them about my item they said it was sent out. i have ordered at least 25 items from amazon this month and i received every item but the one that i ordered from them."
2,Few words but great content...,"The book is VERY SMALL. In fact it's TINY. There are not many words in this book series though the content is interesting and, in places, even powerful. I would, however, not recommend it above meatier offerings and would suggest you select something on the lines of Moody's Handbook on Theology or the like. I know they're very different offerings, but tiny books that cost a lot annoy me. TD, you really should group your Ephesians booklets together and give us value for money (or should that be value for prosperity?); that way I'd have only been disappointed once, not six times. Could have been named ""Six pillows from Ephesians""."
5,A Passion For Life,"I have known Sylence for some time now. Though dark at times, her passion for life is only equaled to her zest for the written word. It is a fascination to peer into one's soul as they lay themselves open and vulnerable in this written word. I am honored to have known such a person and I encourage everyone to read this intriguing collection of works. Sylence, thank you for sharing yourself and for allowing your voice to be heard."
5,Best of the Expansions,I've been playing EverQuest(EQ) since the Ruins of Kunark release. I have all of the expansions available for EQ. Out of all the expansions this one takes the cake. Most players can only get to a handful of the zones offered in the other expansions without the aid of other players which makes them (other expansions) frustrating. In this expansion All the adventure zones are in the original released zones on EQ. People MUST group to do an adventure. The timer on each adventure adds to the excitement. Win or Lose Players are bound to have fun!*please note that you must reach lvl 20 to enter an adventure. Oasis is a good place to work on your high teen lvls-High lvls are around to take down the giants and buff you up if you ask NICELY! (entrance to an adventure is in this zone)
5,Power Leveling,"A very well spent $25. No need to camp for good drops or loot anymore. The ""instancing"" of dungeons in the game for your party only ensures that you and your party are the only ones in the dungeon. It automatically adjusts the difficulty to the level of your party (so have highest level enter first for best loot and experience). The dungeons are supposedly for between 4-6 persons, but don't try it with only 4 unless your party members are ""super-twinked"" and experienced with good communication. Add the weight-reducing bag you get for doing the easy quest, and it makes sense to buy this retail version..with the ""digital download"" you don't get a bag. Don't forget to upgrade it to the 10 slot Giant bag by doing a bit more quest work. - Susy Whorton"
3,Would it have been so hard to include the doll?,"The playset, once assembled, is nice. But unless you have found the doll from some other retailer (as TRU apparently doesn't carry it), you're child(ren) are probably going to be as disappointed as mine are right now."
2,"Not as much fun as ""I"" thought it would be","My 4 year old daughter received this toy as a birthday present. She was very excited at first, but when she realized she didn't know any of the songs on the 3 cartridges that she received, it wasn't very much fun. Her two year old sister isn't that interested either. Also, why couldn't have Fisher Price have made an electric adapter for this toy...6 C batteries is a lot."
3,Wish I had read the reviews before I purchased!,I bought this for my 5 year old daughter for Christmas. She needs help setting it up each time she wants to use it. We have it hooked up via the DVD player so it has to be on the right setting or it won't work.She doesn't know all the songs that are on the cartridges so she mumbles and humms along. She gets frustrated and then walks away.The lighting in the room has to be good or it's hard for the kids to see themselves. The instructions give examples of good and bad lighting. I'm hoping that she regains interest in it because it was not cheap!
2,"Do you have a video camera, if so save your $$","Although the idea is fun the actual toy lacks a good visual image display of your toddler. We took ours back because the clarity is pretty poor even with the right lighting. If you have a video camera and a cd player save your money and plug the video camera into the tv, turn it on and let your toddler watch themselves dance and sing to any cd you put in. Buy them a pretend microphone and you are all set."
2,Please don't buy this toy,"I bought this for my 4 year old for her birthday and it is terrible. After listening to one song, she told me it was boring. I even bought some additional song packs, but they are not music that she relates to. She loves to sing and dance, but if she is singing, she can't hear the musical recording. The clarity of the picture on the screen is not what I would consider a high quality and the star image never appears on my screen. Instead it appears even darker then the normal image.To make matters even worse is that you must put batteries in it and the instructions specifically state that if you do not turn off the device after each use, it does not turn off automatically. Therefore, you are required to turn off and turn on with each use.Most of the songs are far over my child's head and even with buying additional song cartridges, I don't think we will ever get our money out of this toy."
3,read the product specs,"I don't have this toy -- I am thinking of buying it. So ignore my rating -- I wasn't allowed to post without one.I just wanted to point out that if you don't like the song cartriges, the audio plug in will hook you up to any CD player. You can put on nursery rhymes, Xmas music, whatever."
1,Waste of money,"Picture quality is horrible, and eats up batteries. Huge waste of money, even with my 25% coupon."
1,Just don't do it!,"I didn't listen to those who reviewed before me! I was just convinced that the Star Station couldn't be as bad as everyone made it out to be. Well, I was wrong. It's terrible. The picture is awful and most kids who would enjoy this equipment don't know the songs that are available. I am so disappointed in Fisher-Price! Great concept, terrible delivery! Save your money and wait for something better to arrive on the scene. My 5 year old has played with it once since receiving it a week ago."
1,Save Your money,"Scammed again by the toyman...........Saw the commercials, kids begged for it, stood in line at Toys R Us three days before Christmas to purchase it even though my gut told me otherwise. I have a 5 year old and a 2 year old, they enjoyed the gimmick for about ten minutes christmas morning and then went on to their other toys. The picture quality is terrible, the voice sound volume is barely audible. The shame of dropping $60 bucks on this piece of crap is unbearable. Hopefully this review will help save some of you. Take a stand against these companies constantly ripping of the consumer and keep your money in your pocket."
1,Don't waste your money!!!!!,This is one of the dumbest toys I ever bought for my children. They used it for literally 5 minutes and have not touched it since. The image quality is awful and basically the whole toy is horribly designed. Please avoid this product and don't dissapoint your children.
2,Star station disappointment,"We were very excited for our daughter to receive this toy for christmas...We were really disappointed in its picture & music quality. On display at Wal Mart, the picture is clear and in color...On our tv at home the picture is grainy with very little color. Our (4 yr old) daughter has a difficult time getting the music to play. It is also hard to line up so that she is the ""star."" Although it takes a lot of batteries, she has not used it enough to use them up. I would not recommend this product until it is improved upon."
2,Big Disappointment,"This is the main gift our daughter received for Christmas this year. Unfortunately, it was the biggest disappointment of all gifts our 4 children received.Be aware that this machine runs only on batteries (that is one tidbit I overlooked when deciding to order this product). If I had known, I would not have purchased it. Most disappointing about this product, besides running only on batteries, is the accompanying music. Do not waste your money ordering the additional music cartridges. They certainly are not worth the $10 we paid for each additional cartridge. You can connect the system to a portable CD player for a much better selection of music."
1,"Horrible! May I have a REFUND, Please?","To say that I searched high and low for this toy is an understatement. I just knew that my wanna be singing daughter would love this toy. She probably would have if the darn thing ever worked. I couldn't get the microphone to work and the play button on the machine wouldn't advance. Was this supposed to be in color, Fisher Price? The picture (black and white) was the only thing that was right on this machine because, although no color, the picture was clear. False advertisement because the box was in color. I did return it to Target and went searching again. I ended up buying a karoake machine for myself and my daughter loved that. I'd go with grab a microphone and some CDS and wait until Fisher Price does it the right way and save your money until then! Fisher Price, you've not done it this time and I usually love your brand."
