4,Don't need flashback to understand movies,"It's a great movie, I think american people will enjoy a lot. Under my opinion technically almost perfetc. Excellent fotography, marvellous sound... but the history is a remake from other picture from the 40's.I believe we all are enough intelligents to understand the overall situation without the two flashbacks. In the begining of the action on the beach, I don't understand where the people hides when the camera looks from the german machine gun point of view, from this point all the script is excellent and fresh until the meddle of the movie, it looks almost documental. But when the command arrives to the german machine gun nest... from this point to the end of the movie the tone of the history changes and follow the way of others greats war and adventures movies. We can see if we forget the flashbacks."
2,it's really not that good,"I have to admit, I reviewed this film once before and I gave it an unfair review. I still think it is a really bad movie but i only gave it one star because I was mad at how people can call this the greatest war film ever made, probably having never seen most of them. I re-reviewed this just to tell most of you that this film is not perfect in every way and the way that it is least perfect is by far the cinematography. It is extremely poorly shot. If you look closely, much of the film is overexposed and probably not on purpose. Plus there are many continuity errors and such a stupid improbable plot. Think twice people."
4,Saving Private Ryan - DTS,"Saving Private Ryan was a good movie. Realistic sound effects, a must for any good movie. A good story line, keeps the viewer engrossed. The battle scenes were well done, but a little unrealistic. Like the Germans constantly running directly into the American machine gun lines of fire and being killed. The Germans always being outsmarted by Captain Miller. I must say the Germans didnt shoot back very often in the movie. In reality the Germans had machine guns in World War 2 and used them. This movie doesnt give the Germans the respect they deserve. They kept the Allies box in at Normandy for weeks after D-Day and this movie portrays them as unorganised rabble which was not the case, the total opposite. Still despite some oversights it was a good movie."
4,newer version,"No Doubt this is a great WWII movie. However, one reviewer had wrote it(the new 60th anniversary edition) has a DTS soundtrack , this information is incorrect. (Dolby Digital only). I bought a somewhat rare DTS version of the previous DVD version. In my opinion DTS is superior to Dolby Digital. You gotta hear it to know what I'm talking about. This version is superior in terms of the new added content(2 Discs), but until they release a version like this one that has a DTS soundtrack I won't upgrade mine."
5,Extraordinary,"This movie has it all. Wonderful acting, detailed storyline, and breathtaking special effects. Tom Hanks and Tom Sizemore put in their usual top level performance and the remainder of the cast is rock solid as well. The mission given to Tom Hanks and his men is a bit unusual but adds to the sense of tragedy of the crusade in Europe. The true gem of this movie; however, is the special effects. The opening sequence on Omaha Beach sets the pace. I saw this originally in the theater and when the landing craft ramp drops and the German machine guns open up, I actually ducked. This level of realism continues throughout the movie culminating with a close combat battle between GI's and authentic German Armor. If, like me, you have been frustrated by movies that have consistently failed in either reality or authenticity, this movie won't let you down."
5,ENGLISH WHINERS SHUT UP,"...This is a movie produced and filmed by Americans, primarily written for American audiences. If the British want to tell their version of D-Day they should film their own movie. Another English critic blasted the US for not entering the war until after Pearl Harbor....give me a break...if the British and French governments had had any guts they would have stood up to Hitler's demands at Munich and possibly prevented the entire war. Or they could have launched an invasion of Germany prior to May of 1940 and possibly kept France from falling under Nazi occupation. No one has ever said the US won the war by itself, but lets face it, once America entered the war we took on the lion's share of the action in Europe, and played an even greater role in the Pacific. The Brits are still steamed that the USA emerged from the war as a super power, while the sun was sitting on the British Empire."
3,"DTS sound not working, washed out colors","I loved this movie, however, the DVD failed to produce DTS digital sound, all I got was regular surround. Also, colors were washed out in several of the brighter scenes. I wonder if the publishers delay was because of poor quality they ended up deciding not to fix?"
5,The best war film ever!,From the scene on the Dog Green sector at Omaha to the huge forty-minute battle in Ramelle at the end this film keeps your eyes glued to the screen. Great!
5,AWESOME,"The Movie sends chills down my spine. With the exception of The Band of Brothers DVD collection, nothing can compare to the feel you get from Saving Private Ryan. With a cast full of talented actors on the verge of breaking-out, and led by the man himself (Tom Hanks), you cant help but feel like your in the middle of the action. Barry Pepper was unbelievable in his role as the sniper Jackson, and Giovanni Ribisi was good too. Even Vin Diesal gave a good performance."
2,Spielberg Makes No Good War Film,"Special effects are not everything for a film. Especially for a war film. The screenwriting and directing did an astonishing bad job. Spielberg didn't even focus on someone who was talking in the film, was that a good directing job?"
5,Hands down the most harrowing movie ever made to epitomize the struggles faced by the veterans of WWII.,"Saving Private Ryan was one of the most neccesary films that has ever been made. It is the harrowing story of a squad of men led by John H. Miller {Hanks} and captures the very gritty realities of war. Set during the D-Day invasion into fortress Europe, it captures in the best possible sense the toll that war exacts upon those who are called upon to defend freedom. Spielberg also made Band of Brothers which is also an amazing story of heroism and sacrifice renowned the world over. No doubt in my mind that these works that Steven Spielberg has masterfully created will live on through the generations as some of the greatest war epics ever depicted on film. It will tell and retell to those who might forget the stories that should never be lost of the people who should never be forgotten. I give it A+,5 Stars and Two-Thums Up."
2,Steven Spielberg saves another atrocious movie.,"If one were to edit out the opening and closing scenes(the opening for sure, it was done just for shocks) this would easily be the worst war movies ever. Lame acting (on most parts), horrible dialogue, and boring overall. Sure, war is horrible and it was depicted here truthfully, that's why I gave it 2 stars, but if anyone else had directed it, you would be inclined to agree."
2,Powerful subject but trite filmmaking.,"As my screenwriting professor says (a voting member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences), Steven Spielberg uses historic events to serve his films instead of using his films to serve these events (WWII, the Holocaust, etc.). Although the subject and cinematography are powerful, Spielberg has yet to learn how to tell a story. He uses the same book-ending device he uses in most of his films (beginning and ending on the American flag) and his structure and characters are formulaic. Do not be deceived by blood and guts parading as true drama."
4,Perhaps not the greatest war movie...,"but certainly the greatest visual explanation of what it meant to be a soldier involved with D-Day. Certainly many viewers will be put off by the overwhelming gore depicted during the first half hour of the film, but this scene, along with the other fire fights, are the essence of Spielberg's masterpiece. Read ""D-Day, Day of Destiny"" by Stephen Ambrose and you'll learn that Spielberg was not being gratuitous with the violence; he barely scratched the surface. War is a complicated subject, and Saving Private Ryan no doubt does not address the deeper issues surrounding World War II. Add to this that the ending is just a bit romanticized and, in my view, weak, and SPR cannot be considered as the last word in World War II pictures. Nonetheless, SPR should be required viewing so that all understand the enormous debt we owe the brave men who fought in Normandy on 6 June 1944."
5,We all know the movie is excellent,"For all of you stereo freeks like myself who have decided to pay for the extra surround goodies with DTS. Trust me, if you are contemplating the money difference between the DD and DTS versions, the extra bucks are worth it. I own both and in direct comparison, I will choose the DTS version 9 days a week. Trust me."
4,A good introduction to a bad genre,"This movie was a good see in general, bringing the horrors of war on screen in a moving experience. Unfortunately this movie has led to a whole bunch of bad war movie follow-ups, such as windtalkers, tears of the sun, and black hawk doen."
3,Yet another REVENGE film,"Wow. It took me a few viewings of this movie to finally realize that SPR is a WWII version of ""Deathwish"", with Toms Hanks playing the part of Charles Bronson (with plenty of John Wayne mixed in too).After Hank's character, Captain John Miller, watches fellow American troops get slaughtered at Omaha Beach during the inital D-Day landings on June 6, 1944, the American audience then get the satisfaction of watching of Miller and his squad of Rangers distribute payback against the evil Germans. Some good guy troops of the American 101st Airborne division also help out, and the ending battle climaxes with a handful of tough Americans killing Nazis by the dozens.Tom Hanks gets to blow-up a German 60 ton Tiger tank with his pistol!"
3,"GREAT ACTION SEQUENCES, BUT...","This movie is ""empty"", like the great majority of Spielberg's films. (the only exception being ""SCHINDLER'S LIST) He is always sentimental, defending the so-called ""american way of life"". He's a false sentimental man. In this movie, the battle sequences are the best ever made. It showed naive people (because I think few people needed to see this movie to know that war is hell) how it was, using sheds of blood. But the plot... it's ridiculous, extremely patriotic (it had to have an American flag in the end...), but the actor really look like soldiers. In general, much better than his last ""bomb"", ""LOST WORLD""."
3,Propaganda for hatred and intolerance,"The only reason I give this movie so high a rating is because it was well-made and had good acting/actors, but in fact I am repulsed by this simplistic, closed-minded glorification of war. Good and evil are black and white, as are entire nations of people, or so this movie would have you believe. If you want to see a more humanistic film that portrays war as a terrible thing, regardless of losing or winning, go see the beautiful ""The Thin Red Line,"" in which 'the bad guys' are also human, not deceitful monsters, and the 'good guys' are not simply personifications of bravery, nationalism, and intolerance."
2,Spielbergian Schizophrenia,"A very strange film, that can't quite make up it's mind about what it wants to be. It wants to be a powerful statement about the horrors of war, and a moving tribute to the men who fought and died in WWII, and a really cool war movie with lots of cool battle scenes. Needless to say, the final result fails to really coalesce into a coherent whole. As in most Spielberg films, the material points one way, and Spielberg goes in another.But Spielberg loads on the HIGH SIGNIFICANCE at every turn, and when all else fails, the music swells dramatically to remind us to start crying. Because, of course, you know that a movie is really good when it makes you cry, right?Well..."
5,"Powerfully breathtaking, a masterpiece of a film!","Steven Spielberg is a master at what he does, there is no reason why this film should not have won the ""Best Picture"" Oscar. ""Saving Private Ryan"" is the most realistic, emotionally draining, and terrifying portrayal of men at war. It is brutal but honest, and gives the viewer a true sense of belonging in an infantry platoon. The films touch of authenticity is, once again, a great credit to Cpt Dale Dye, who worked on ""Platoon"". Tom Hanks gives another outstanding performance as does the rest of its cast. Being a Gulf War veteran, this film does hit hard, but it is about as close to combat as anyone sober would want to be."
1,Technical Difficulties,"I loved this movie, even though uneven at times. I eagerly awaited my DVD, and when I popped it in the machine, my Panasonic A110 couldn't play it. It would make a horrible racket and spin incorrectly. My CD player couldn't handle it, either (I tested it for defects). Amazon was great in sending a new one out which I should get soon. Any other problems suffered by anyone?"
1,SAVING PRIVATE RYAN IS OVER-RATED,"I agree with EVERYTHING that is written in Steve McMahon's review (see below). With the exception of the ""bookend"" battle scenes, ""Saving Private Ryan"" had nothing to say. For a better war movie, check out Stanley Kubrick's ""Paths of Glory."""
4,EXCELLENT WAR MOVIE!,THIS MOVIE SHOWS TONS OF BLOOD AND GUN ACTION.THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST WAR MOVIES EVER IN MY LIFE TIME.BUY THIS RIGHT HERE AND NOW.
4,"Great Movie, awesome acting","Saving Private Ryan is a very well made movie, but is somewhat 'hollywoodized'. Spielburg is not one to make beauiful movies, but he puts quite a bit of depth into Saving Private Ryan. I would not call it the best war movie of all time, if you think it is please see The Thin Red Line, but it is definatly one of the the best. I won't forget to mention it is one of the more graphic war movies. I've been known to have a 'different' taste in movies but I think everyone can agree that this is a very well made movie that deserves credit.(although I'm still sour with Spielburg because of A.I.! why did Kubrick have to die?!?!!?!!)"
4,good movie . . . but not the best,"when i first saw ""Saving Private Ryan"", i liked it, but then it's not the greatest war film ever made. i give that honor ot Oliver Stone's brilliant ""Platoon"".this film tells the story of a squad of closely-knit soldiers sent on a mission to rescue Private James Ryan. Ryan's three brothers are killed on D-Day and the Army wants the sole-remaining Ryan to be returned home.but of course the squad runs into problems. two men are shot, and the captain, John Miller (Tom Hanks) has nervous breakdowns.so, if you're looking for a good war movie, rent and watch Steven Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"". but if you want to see the BEST, see ""Platoon"""
3,War!,"The first 30minutes are the best warscenes in history. After that you can relax, this is not the masterpiece you thuoght it was."
3,A Feel Good Propoganda Movie,"Unabashadly pro-american. Nothing wrong with that but it is kind of a yawn to see another war movie that places the germans with no character, existing for the sole purpose to be eventually blown away by americans. The Omaha Beach landing scene was a good rush, but personally I like my stories to have antagonists with personalities. Plus the typcasting... the Jew, the Pencilhead, The Italian, The Brooklynite... etc. UGH! BEAT ME WITH A HAMMER! Take away the great visual battle scene and all you have is another formula story."
5,"It Still Awes Me, Even After Dozens of Viewing","Anyone who watches ""Saving Private Ryan"" and can say they weren't emotionally engaged in the first and last ten minutes of the movie need not be going to see first-class movies like this one. The research, sets, acting (Tom Hanks especially), special effects and audio tracks are about as good as it gets.Note: This Blu-ray version is one to check out your audio-vison sound. Better turn that subwoofer down though or the German Tiger Tank's thunderous approach at the end of the movie might blow your system straight to Normandy."
5,Saving Private Ryan: A Great Movie,"Saving Private Ryan is one of the best movies ever made. Not only is the acting, special effects, sound, and all the other physical features to this movie OUTSTANDING, but the originallity of the story is excellent, and it is proven to be of Steven Spielberg's best; right up there with Schindler's List. This is a must see movie, and is worth sitting through all of the blood and gore. It shows what men must do, in order to save the lives of others. It shows what they WILL do, to do what is right."
3,It's so damn Patriotic,"The action scenes are undeniably fantastic, and I must say that for most of its long duration, I was enthralled, and disgusted - which is how I wanted to feel when dealing with war. However, the beginning and the end of this movie just ruined it so much for me. I felt like screaming out ""There were more people fighting in the war than just the Americans"" War in a way was seen as a great big adventure, when you are there hoping the American's will win. How this got a best screenplay nomination at the oscars beats me, there was no screenplay, just brilliantly executed battle scenes. At least The Thin Red Line has something to say. Great acting all round"
5,Very Well Done,"At the beginning of this movie, you see a man walking through rows and rows of crosses in a military cemetery. This is the opening to one of the greatest war movies I have ever seen. The whole story is amazingly written and is suggested to anyone who wants to see what war really has to offer. This movie explains to the audience that war isn't just a game and it tells a story of men in combat better than any movie I have ever seen. This is a very excellent movie and I would suggest it to anyone willing to see the blood."
2,Saving Private Ryan,"Good technical, realistic opening. Unfortunately the WW II story of the average soldier is lost in the quote We gotta save a kid! end quote heart-warmer. D-day was the story of thousands who risked everything and sometimes sacrificed all for their fellow servicemen. This Ryan vignette is a sideline for the non-hardcore (who seem to often love the opening sequence, oddly.) See The Longest Day for the overall story. It is THE movie that the current generation don't believe was ever made. Then tell me about how Hollywood used to quote glorify end quote war!"
2,no DTS?,The best thing to commemorate about this movie was the awesome sound editing. So leaving a DTS track out of this commemorative edition is dumb. Why not make the dvd badass if you're going to all the trouble of re-releasing it with all kinds of extras? I'd rather have a better quality viewing experience than all that extra hype they stuff onto these discs.
2,"It's this film, not Monty, that is overrated.","This is just another Hollywood war film. Watching this film made me lose all respect (not that I had any to begin with) for Spielberg and Hanks. I can't believe they said Monty was overrated. He was the best allied commander of the war. Typical Yanks, taking all the credit for themselves.The only reason Monty took his time moving on Caen was because the British and Canadians had to take on the Elite of the German army, including SS Panzer divisions. The U.S. soldiers only had to fight the normal army. It's more American propaganda, making themselves look like the best when that is not the case."
2,Outstanding picture and sound quality....but.....,"Talk about overhype! The DTS DVD has outstanding reference picture and sound quality but the story? I found the premise so weak and was bored after 15 minutes. For a decent war movie try: The Thin Red Line, Full Metal Jacket or Stalingrad (which I think is the finest)."
3,does every copy have the same pixel glitch?,"When I bought my copy from amazon I watched it and was happy upuntil, after the last battle, Upham kills the german who was releasedearlier in the movie.There are several seconds of pixel malfunction.I decided not to make a fuss about it because I'm lazy and it didn'truin the experience except for the part where I think I should getwhat I pay for.I'm mentioning this now because I have seen the movie three times ontv broadcast and each time the same pixel glitch occurs in the same place.I find it hard to believe that this kind of fault can be accepted in a""world class"" product, but, I saw it.Am I the only one?"
5,d day,saving private ryan is one of the best movies ever made. Also that stupid person who said us americans should be ashamed about our army and our particapation in world war 2.he said i was in one of those countries that wasnt envolved . well what would your country be like if the americans didnt land on d day . well your ass would of been taken over by hitler . so next time you insult the americans think where you could of been without us.
2,"Decent, but not great","Truthfully, Steven Spielberg has gone downhill since ""Jaws."" He put alot into the Normandy scene, which was great, but the rest of this movie really drags. The problem is simple: the movie is just too damn long. I'll give credit to Spielberg for reinventing how battle scenes are filmed, but the story is really lacking. Tom Hanks is probably the most overrated actor of our time."
5,A horrorfying war film,I've seen it 8 times and I still feel sick after the first 30 minutes. It's the best war film ever made and it's based on a true story. Tom Hanks is one of the best actors I've ever seen. You can wonder if the actors are soldiers. They seemed to bee soldiers for me. Private Jackson (Barry Pepper)became my favorite. See this movie once and you will never forget it.
3,Good movie...too long,"Alright I will start by saying that movie is well done and performed! Hanks did a great job as well as the other actors that participated in the film. However, I did see this movie twice in the theatre and found it to be very bloody almost too much. I understand he was trying to make the experience real and all...but it was too much. On and other note.....the pot was great...nice story...too long! There was sooooo very much that could have easily been thrown out! Overall.....Good movie, but highly over rated!"
3,"Great war scenes, cheesy John Wayne story","The opening scene of the old man falling in front of the grave is good. The next 25 minutes are spectacular. Then comes the John Wayne story. There's the Christian guy, Jewish guy, guy from Brooklyn, big tough guy, daddy, guy that freaks out, caring guy (medic). All of the violence is first rate. When the medic dies - very well done. Final battle - awesome. Final scene with old man saluting - terrible. Too many long speeches. War stopped to let guys tell their feelings. 'Thin Red Line' is more unconventional and much better."
5,THE BEST!,"This movie is definetely one my favorite movies. Along with Black Hawk Down it has a storyline unlike other war movies. This movie should go down into history and honor the veterans. The movie has an incredible cast, Tom Hanks, Tom Sizemore, Matt Damon, Edward Burns, Jeremy Davies, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg,Giovanni Ribisi, and Vin Diesel. They give a mememorable performance."
3,Talking about video quality ...,"""SPR"" is a great film. I don't remember how it was in the DVD, but it DOESN'T have a great quality video in Blu-ray. It never deserves 5 stars. Sometimes it's 2, sometimes it's 4. Highdef Digest said it is realistic. Realistic video is, for example, the video of ""Heroes"". ""Heroes"" is 5 stars in video quality. Colors, details, etc are great. I don't care if the director of a movie wanted this or wanted that ""kind of visual"". I just care if a movie has a good video quality. ""SPR"" is under the limits for what Blu-ray tecnology can deliever. I saw too ""SEVEN"" in BD, far better that ""SPR""."
5,A must see movie.,"A films vivid depiction of WAR & all the human elements involved therein, every American should see this movie, it should be part of school curriculum in my opinion. The horror of combat should aid to remind us of the futility of war and the fragility of the human body, the supreme sacrifice made by our forefathers and current men and women of the military. It is a brutal film that I shed a tear to every time I watch it, we can learn so much, especially about not repeating the same mistakes."
5,A Spielberg masterpiece,"If you haven't been exposed to this movie either by watching it orby hearing other people's reaction to it, then you must live under a rock.The acting is excellent, throughout the cast. The portrayal of thelanding at Normandy is a classic with no equal. The story convincinglyshows the confusion and ambiguous moral choices that occur in wartime.This movie is a grittily realistic masterpiece. If you haven't seen it yet,DO IT NOW! ;-P j/k It's well worth the cost of the disk and though I seldomwatch a movie more than once, I found this movie enjoyable through repeatedviewings."
5,Saving Private Ryan,"A great movie, with alot of action. It has a lot of great stars in it and is full of action."
5,Saving Private Ryan,This is one of the greatest stories ever told. If your interested in military movies this one is a must. I have watched this movie over a hundred times. This movie is about sacrifice for mission accomplishment. This is a must have for any movie collector.
5,What a great movie!,"What can I say, other than what a great movie! Tom Hanks is given the gruelling job of searching out a mothers last living son from the war ridden coasts of France. But when the boy does not want to go but rather stay, and fight his last battle, Tom is forced to stay. But will Tom Hanks loose even more than his rank if he stays to insure that Private Ryan gets home safely to his heartsick mother? A very touching movie!"
2,Sounds mostly,"Trains running on tracks, whispering, and other nise/ ambient sounds make up a lot of this. Tracks like The Road with its piano and Titles- Run with its pulsing beat are good, while the music of Japan is sparse along the line of Stars of The Lid but not as good. Piano has the suspense of strings with a duduk over followed by some haunting piano chords. Actually, The Final Titles, Piano, The Road and Title - Run are the only ""songs"" here and all you really need."
4,She is cool,"I like this Yasmin,but I like Sasha best.Cloe`s cute.But I didn`t like Fianna and Jade(My favorite Bratz character).SARA SIBLINI!!!MY SCENE LOVER!!!BRATZ LOVER!!!BARBIE FASHION FEVER LOVER!!!*FOREVER*"
5,Bratz Skater,I purchased this item for my daughter because she had the bratz skating ring but no other items that will go with the interactive ring that my sister had purchased for her. I wished that there were other skating dolls for me to purchase because she loves to play with that ring all day.
1,exPENSIVE,I THOUGHT THE DOLL WAS SUPER EXPENSIVE WHEN I SAW HER FOR 45 DOLLARS I THOUGHT CUTE DOLL BUT DO I REALLY WANT TO SPEND MY MONEY ON THAT I WOULD MUCH RATHER SPEND MY MONEY ON SOMETHING MORE CHEAPER!!
2,this is odd,as i was reading the back of my doll and many other dolls it saidthey were asin. odd right
2,A very big dissopointment for bratz!,"yasmin is very weird!She is wearing strange clothes and the visor is VERY ugly.Her shorts are so high and the clothes are just well...''interestig''.!The other flashbacks are very cool looking and have 70's-90's clothes,but nothing like this.I would not buy this!But not to sound like a snob to you people who like this,but this is just my opinon.See ya"
1,yuck,why so much for junk.the way they are dressed are a bad influence for kids . +they are ugly. my scene is better.dont waste your money on this
5,Snow blower cover,Delivered when promised. Easily covers a large Cub Cadet blower. Kept blower dry during a recent ice/wind storm. Glad I purchased it.Classic Accessories Snow Thrower Cover #71007
2,not a good test book,"I do not think it is a good test book, because the editors are very careless. I find several wrong answers in it and I think for a test book, the accuracy is very important. if you want to buy this book, do not always trust the answers the book give you."
3,Collection of Essays,"This book is a collection of essays written by Cardinal Dulles. On of the chapters I enjoyed best was about the strengths and weaknesses of Scholastic theology. Having been educated in this type of doing theology, Dulles acknowledges ten good things about it (pp. 42-43). He then compares the methodology of Scholasticism (controversial, argumentative, apologetical, deductive and inductive) with the methodology of present day theology (open to dialogue, inductive, hermeneutical, empirical, interested not only in the content of the faith, but in its dynamics and socio-political applications). In the book the reader will also learn about ten approaches to Scriptures; Hans Kung's christological presuppositions; and the transformative power of beliefs."
4,The Craft of Theology,This book is required reading for a course in Orientation to Theology at St. Bernard's School of Ministry and Theology I am enrolled in. The book is easily read and very informative.
5,Better than I expected.,"I needed new silverware and couldn't match my Oneida pattern exactly, but then found this pattern. I am very happy with my purchase. It turned out bettter than I expected. An now I have 12 of everything again."
3,Post-Revolutionary Mexico Under Scrutiny,"Elena Poniatowska's new novel achieves the remarkable: it presents, in a very few pages, a rather in-depth look at Mexican society following the Second World War, doing so not as dry commentary but purely in terms of the personal. Ashby Egbert, scion of one of Mexico's most privileged families, accidentally touches a high-tension wire and as a result spends two years in various hospitals, in one of which he comes in contact with a part of Mexico which he has never seen before. This is only the beginning of his interior change, one which the reader follows avidly page by page. Poniatowska, as usual, utilizes an extensive vocabulary and elegant writing style to create characters one can never forget and invites the reader into aspects of her country's social fabric which bear closer scrutiny. This is not light reading. It has all the marks of a book that will last."
3,BAD ENDING,"This is a book about a very rich guy named Ashby, but because of some unfortunate accidents his life gets turn up side down. Eventually his life gets fixed but after meeting Amaya his life changes all over again. It is a good book but the endings is just too happy, it looks like a fairy tale or something like that"
3,review on The Monkey Tree,this book is a good book about a 14-year-old girl who has drawn a picture called the monkey tree telling us that we should help other people. like Susanna i also felt like her trying to help other people so that they can have better lives instead having a really bad one. So in the end i think that is a good book to read if your in the 7th or 8th grade.
4,Too Fragile,"Braun is a great shaver. Far better than all of the name brand rotary blades out there. However, this foil is too fragile in my estimation. I have had to replace at least once a year because of cracks in the foil. If you hit the head of the shaver on anything, it will crack the foil and you end up spending $20 for a replacement. And the plastic guard that protects it does not stay on the head very securely. Pops off too easily and the tabs on the sides of the plastic protector break off too easily. Other than that, Braun is highly recommended for a close shave with stiff beards."
4,Typical Sharpe,Not bad but at times one gets tired of the hero being put in seemingly hopeless situations which magically get solved.
2,Must read!,"I have enjoyed the Sharpe chronicles on two levels. One is the detail of British soldiers, their background, their training, their combat, Bernard Cornwell has an impressive way of writing that makes the cold, the heat, the dust, the fear, the savage rage, the atrocity of war real. The second reason is he is able to detail the political and cultural aspects vivid and astonishing."
5,Sharpe's Sword,Any book by Bernard Cornwell is amazing. Truly one of the greatest historical novelists of our time and one of the greatest book series ever. I highly recommend The Sharpe Series to any history buff.
3,nice,i think this is really fun becuase you can give them little baths but i think for that the price is to much. its something i would consiter buying but not my first choise. make sure you read about this product before buying it. thanks =D krissy 12

3,The Revelation of Saint John an Open Book,"Irving C.Tomlinson's, The Revelation of Saint John An Open Book, has unlocked the codes and seeming secrets of Revelation. Originally published in 1922, and revised in 1935.Part I organizes the Biblical text in accord with the Revelator's scientific design.Part II provides 47 explanatory notes that illuminates obscure references such as to ""the sea of glass"", ""the four beasts about the throne"", ""the Star, Wormwood"", and the ""twenty-four elders"". Each note explains their context, linkages to the Old Testament, and relevance to our modern times.Part III provides footnotes and references to the writings of Mary Baker Eddy and other Bible passages that are like a weekly Bible lesson for each verse in Revelation.An Open Book as been out of print for almost five decades."
4,Keillor at his storytelling best. Chet Atkins a bonus.,"This ""Last Show"" is a stream of sentimental singsong broken with dramatic radio, Keillor's captivating narration, and the amazing guitar-picking of Chet Atkins, along with other accomplished musicians, well worth the experience for Keillor and Prairie Home fans."
3,Question of quality,"I was very excited to have the 2 benches that I ordered arrive in such a timely manner. The boxes were a bit tattered since they weighed 90 lbs a piece. When I took all of the pieces out of the box I was a bit disappointed in the quality of the wood. They say they are oak but not the oak I am use to seeing. The wood is a bit rough and not smooth at all. There were a few nicks on the arm pieces and one was actually cracked. I will have to either put a coat of urethane on them just to see if that will help. The benches did go together fairly easy ""No Man Required"" yet I did have to use some balancing tricks to get them together. All in all after I do some minor ""fix Ups"" I believe that they will be a wonderful asset to my patio."
2,Astonica Star Bloosom Bench,"While I am delighted with the style of the above bench I purchased, the condition from shipping and the finish leave a lot to be desired. There were deep scratches in the wood slats and the finish was rough and crude. I shall have to strip it and refinish it before use."
1,"Cheaply made, terrible quality","We thought that for close to $90 that we would get something moderately functional...The first bench that we received had several of the pieces broken, marred or cracked. We called and asked for some replacement pieces - and received a box full of more broken, scratched, unusable pieces. There was no packing material in either box to protect the pieces. However, out of the two boxes, and a few hardware purchases, we were able to construct a mostly complete bench - only a few pieces were scratched or cracked. Now, 2 months later, ALL of the finish is literally peeling off of the bench, the wrought iron design is completely rusted - it LOOKS TERRIBLE! What a WASTE of money!"
4,Good sturdy bench,Nice bench that was easy to put together and is very sturdy. Only problem I had was dealing with the enormous cardboard box it came in.
3,Enjoyed,this movie was ok. Not really what I expected but it was still good because it kept my attention through the whole movie... Well sort of anyway.
1,No no no no,"Unlike the Zyliss ""Transparent Rapid Food Chopper A-1"" or the Zyliss ""Comfort Chopper"", this model's fatal flaws are the slanted sides and reduced footprint of the chopping blade. Even though they've tried to build in paddles that are intended to rotate the food between strokes, the fact is that the end product is very unevenly chopped: finely minced particles accumulate in the center of the chopper while unchopped chunks accumulate around the edge. No amount of agitation of the contents while you're chopping will induce this gadget to create an evenly chopped result.And, being plastic, this one didn't last any longer than the Transparent version before the repeated pounding that's a normal aspect of using it cracked the latches that hold the thing together. Is it possible to give negative stars?"
2,I learned my to chop by hand,I bought this item because I hate chopping onions most of all and was disappointed with the product. It sticks during chopping. I have learned to manually chop things. I may not be fast as a professional chef but I do a much better job than the chopper does. I ditched the chopper.
2,Upside-down and Backward,"This book was required reading for a class, or I would not have purchased it.The content itself was OK, but it spent too much time going into detail on areas that were obvious, and then introduced new topics with a casual comment and then never explained those any further.On a more practical note, the book was bound on the wrong side, with the cover upside down. You had to hold the book upside down, and then read from the back to the front. I would have had it replaced, however being required for a class I did not have the time to exchange it. On one occasion I actually had a teacher for small children comment on my holding the book upside down. On other occsions small children looked at me very strangely when I was reading."
3,A good book but very expensive,"This book describes how to perform data modeling. It will help you a lot if you are working as a system analyst. It tells you how to get information from the users. Also it discusses the data modeling in deep and teaches you how to identify common mistakes very early.Though the good is very good for modeling, $35 is somehow high for this book.Another point is that is uses a diagram called LDS. This type of diagram is not well known. You'll suffer to find tools that draw this kind of diagrams and to find other professionals who use it."
4,works very well.,"I have gone through many staple guns, not because they wore out, but because they always seem to jam or not drive the staple in all the was. This one works very well. Although it does misfire occasionally."
1,Powerless - or nearly so.,"One of the Amazon product reviews I had read said to ""...avoid buying this product at all costs"" (unfortunately I read the review after I bought the product). Having tried to use the product, I could not agree more with this review. Unless you're interested in stapling into balsa wood, the available power is grossly inadequate. Further, and possibly even more frustrating, the ""power dial"" seems to be nothing more than a placebo. The difference in penetrating power between the heaviest and lightest settings was indistinguishable when trying to staple into pine. Perhaps had I been working with balsa wood..."
1,You have to be kidding me!!!!,"I bought this unit from home Depot. Opened it up, read the instructions, and got down to business. There is nothing to say more than, it is junk!! It doesn't push the staples all the way into the wood, even on the highest setting, and I am working with particle board.I don't usually read reviews of Items that are this cheap. Well, two hours worth of travel and setup time later, I don't have a staple gun that I can use to reupholster my chairs. I haven't been this frustrated with a product in some time."
1,I would give it a zero if I could.,"I just purchased this product - and on the first pine board I upholstered, it stapled MOSTLY flush - I did have to use a hammer to get it the rest of the way down. About 30 staples later, on the second pine board, it was starting to stick, then eventually jammed to the point of needing pliers to remove the staple. I DO NOT RECOMMEND!!"
2,Missed the mark,It doesn't perform as advertised. The depth adjustment does not work well at all. Even driving into pine there is a gap under the staple.This is true for all sizes of staples and the nails. I am going to buy an upholstery stapler for my compressor.
1,Not worth the money,Better spend the money on a manual staple gun. Nail goes only half way at the maximum dial position. I don't know why there are companies still carrying this product! I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!
3,more power /supplies hard to find,Arrow Fastener ET2025D 3 In 1 Electric Staple + Nail Gun : The tool functions well but does not really have enough power to punch through more than a 1/4 inch of pine. I had to order round crown staples from another source that was difficult to find. However if you want to secure wire or cable it will do that just don't expect it to drive the staple too far into the wood.
1,Unacceptable,"I bought the Arrow electric stapler from Home Depot. I also purchased the corresponding staples and took it home to start stapling. I noted that the staples could not penetrate the plywood. I went back and hammered in the loose staples, but most just flattened. After an hour of this, something popped loose within the device and it never stapled again. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise, since I returned it to Home Depot and replaced it with the Powershot Pro: [...]The ""Arrow Fastener 9100K Pro Electric Staple & Nail Gun Kit"" was cheaper, and the staples it used were of a heavier gauge. From then on, stapling was much easier, and required no extra hammering."
1,no power,"Model ET2025HD: I got one of these as a gift 6 months ago. Doesn't even have enough power to sink 3/8"" staples into particle board. Cute light, though :)"
2,Not so good,"I recieved this order very quick. However, after stapling about 4 staples it hung up, and quit working."
1,Are you kidding me??,"This tool is a waste of money. Like all previous reviews, I too find that staples and nails are poorly driven into wood; this renders the tool close to useless for any project - unless the project involves corrugated cardboard as a support material. The degree of incompetence at all levels of development for this fastener is remarkable to me. Where did the engineers who designed this get their degrees from - a box of Cracker Jacks? Quality assurance at Arrow...what's that?? Where is the pride in producing a quality tool? Why is Amazon (and Home Depot) still offering this piece of junk?"
3,No Replacement Headsets,"Bought this because I needed a basic headset phone. When I noticed the insulation of the headphone cord begin to wear out near the earpiece, I contacted Plantronics to see if they had replacement headsets. They told me that I would have to send in the entire unit if I there was a problem with the headset only.Overall the phone is what I was looking for, sound quality is clear and has all the functions of a no-frills phone minus the ability to turn the ringer off. 3 stars because of the headset issue and no convenient way of turning the ringer off."
4,Platronics Headset Telephone,"I like the phone just fine....hate the headset. Even when you are (at least me) able to position it on your ear, you still can't hear (well) unless you press it to your ear.Unless you can find another headset that has a modular plug (that plugs into the phone) you are pretty much stuck with this. Phone itself is fine. Headset sucks."
2,Bulky & Hard to Spin,When I first opened the package and saw the ring I noticed the outside band was pretty thick. I have a spin ring and it's not as nearly as bulky. I think the design is pretty but I was also having a hard time spinning it. It isn't extremely true to size due to the thickness of the outside band but if you want a ring that is bulky and stands out then this is a good ring for you.
5,awesome!,Bought this ring as a thumb ring everyone notices it and comments about how pretty and cool it looks then when I spin it they want to know where I got it I would recommend this ring to any one also very comfy.
1,Not Happy,"After recieving ring in a size that was what I ordered, but, not the true size according to jewelers measurement I returned the ring for a larger size. After recieving instuctions on how to return ring I did exactly as told. When after 2 weeks and no ring or explanation from company I contacted them and was told they had not recieved the ring but, would refund my money. The total credit I recieved was for the amount of ring and original S&H; but not the shipping I paid to send it back or the money I had to send to get the ring shipped back to me again.The emails exchange with Silver Insanity was very unprofessional, making me wonder if this company was ready to go internet with such a large market through Amazon.Will NOT order from them again."
1,They substituted a cheaper bag,"I ordered the purple background princess sleeping bag for my daughter, and Amazon substituted a cheaper version bag with a pink an yellow picture of princesses. I am very frustrated that they didn't ask me first, and I want to know where my refund is!"
5,Beautiful sleeping bag,This is a very beautiful sleeping bag and seems more durable than a sleeping bag that I had bought at a department store. The fabric reminds me of the fabric on real sleeping bags. The colors did not exactly match the colors on the picture shown. The background colors were actually pink. But my neice really enjoys laying in it!
5,Highly Addictive Music,"Ray Lynch has quite some talent! This ""Best of"" CD features 10 of his most loved compositions, plus two brand new tracks and a remix of his most well known piece: ""Celestial Soda Pop"".His music is highly melodic. Foot-tapping stuff indeed! The two new tracks are excellent, and it goes without saying that the other compositions are top-notch. The only surprise is the absence of ""Ivory"", a track many regard as Ray's most beautiful piece.Ray's music is hard to describe. He uses a great assortment of instruments and produces a huge range of sounds; some very conventional, other really unusual and original. Everything, however, blends together really well and this is the sort of music you'll find yourself whistling at work. It's addictive stuff!If you enjoy melodic, catchy rhythmic music that's full of life and energy, you're sure to enjoy this CD.Very highly recommended."
3,A novel with some messages,"The message of this novel is ""Keep curiosity and adventure to the last."" Another message, directed toward the ""modern woman"" the book seems written for, is ""Don't let your husband bully you and put you down."" Blossom is married to Lincoln, a self-centered poet wannabe who works for Blossom's father. Lincoln's father (Ambrose Holt), who long ago abandoned his family, returns to town to everyone's chagrin and anger. But Blossom befriends him and receives the aforementioned messages from him. Lincoln learns his mistaken ways and reforms. The scenes between Blossom and Ambrose, all dialogue, aren't too bad, but the ending with Lincoln is contrived."
2,Dull Reprint,"The drab and fuzzy color photo copies of this recent reprint mute the charm of Miroslav Sasek's original bright and detailed paintings. While it's wonderful that all of the ""This is. . ."" books are now easily available, it's too bad they're redone in a manner that dulls Miroslav Sasek's artistic magic - and the reader's delight."
3,Content needs major update,"The graphics are very nice and there are a lot of accurate description of the culture in Hong Kong. However, most of the contents are about Hong Kong in the 50's. I would really recommend an update to this version. If kids read this book and travel to Hong Kong later, they will be totally shocked."
5,"ONE OF THE BEST,IF NOT THE BEST.","ICEBERG SLIM GIVES THE BEST INSIGHT OF STREET LIFE IN THIS BOOK THAN ANY OTHER I HAVE READ. BEING THE EVENTS IN THE BOOK TOOK PLACE DECADES AGO IT MADE ME REALIZE JUST HOW MUCH LIFE IN THE STREETS HAVE NOT CHANGED, BUT ONLY GOTTEN WORSE . I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ANOTHER BOOK OF HIS "" THE NAKED SOUL OF ICE BERG SLIM ""."
4,a little much for the typical reader,"Having grown up in the Chicago suburbs and been in high school during the gangster-rap glory years, I was only exposed to the fantasy-end of pimp culture in music videos, etc. Iceberg Slim is not the pimp of the type shown on MTV - this story is full of desperation and regret. There is a real pathological hatred of women that plays out in Slim's foul treatment of his prostitutes. Homo-eroticism abounds in Slim's relationships with other, especially more senior pimps. Slim rots in confinement for some time, and guess what, he doesn't enjoy it. This story is good antidote to the pervasive and unambiguous sexuality that gets portrayed on the rap videos (at least, it was when I last watched one in the mid 90's), which ignore the truly aberrent aspects to the lifestyle that gets shamelessly glorified."
2,not good,"People don't be fooled by this book. It's total fiction!!! If you read the in the very beginning of the book(the third page). It says ""This is a work of fiction, all the names and places are fictitious"". I got to give big ups to the people out there who also said it was fictious too, and they are right. Don't go out there trying to pull some of the stuff u read in the book, you gonna look bad. One"
1,ICEBERG STILL DOES THE HUSTLE,"Rule number one: The game is meant to be told, not sold. Anyone who tries to sell you the game is trying to put a ""Murphy"" on you, just like Iceberg describes in the beginning of this book. You want to be a pimp?? Go out on the street and get some game. Like that other reviewer said, the only pimping that will be had from reading this book will be on the streets of Palo Alto and San Jose. I am a true hustler and one of the greatest pimps ever to step foot in California so take it from me: Iceberg is a square and was never ever in the pimp game. This book is funny stuff because everything in it is so wrong and untruthful."
2,It was ok,"You people speak of this book as if it were Faulkner or Joyce or someone like that. It was ok, not great. Plus, if anyone looked in the front of the book they would have noticed that there is a little blurb near the copyright page that says ""This novel is a work of fiction..."""
5,"different players,same game","First and foremost, we must understand that this novel is derived from the social and economic conditions of many decades past. Though it is a fictitious piece of work, Iceberg Slim gives us a vivid picture of ghetto life as seen through the eyes of a true to life pimp. We must understand that the ills of society such as racism and unemployment forced many blacks into this lifestyle during that era. Those who give this novel a negative review, overlook the reason for which Beck wrote the novel in the first place, which was to avoid following his self-destructive path. All in all, survival of the fittest remains to be the order of the day."
5,AWESOME,AWESOME BOOK!!!! Loved it bought a few more copies to give out to my friends as a man you should read this book
5,THE BIBLE,This book is truely the one and only BIBLE to pimping. Simple as that. Worship this book. Too Short the PIMP looks up to Iceberg.
3,Would have given 3 and a half if possible,"This is a tough one to review.....It was a hard read. At times I found it gruelling, gutter soaked and downright dirty. That is the point of the book though. It is a true exposure of the lifestyle, the psychology, the rise and fall etc.Some of Slim's writing is truly undeniable. The book has its share of memorable passages.Why not 4 or 5 'star? This book spends a lot of time in the muck and filth of the street. If you can handle the sloth ridden segments that Slim describes with Shakespearian skill, then it is definitely worth a look.Be prepared."
2,Vivid and raw but dated and bumpy,"Wanted to like this book better than I did. I was hoping for something great but instead found the tale merely lurid.Iceberg Slim's tale of pimping in and around Chicago in the 40s is raw and vivid. His life is twisted and he revels in showing us its brutality.If there is moral clarity anywhere here it must be at the end. I ground to a halt after 75 pages of beatings, betrayals, kinky sex and drug use. The 40s ghetto slang is almost impenetrable at places, a fact acknowledged by the publisher's placement of an (inadequate) dictionary at the end of the book."
5,MAKE A MOVIE OUT OF THIS BOOK!!!,"ATTENTION: Editors, Directors movie makers, get to work on this book as a film. It's your duty to put this book on the silver screen, and if you do it, do it right. Don't leave out anything. This is real-life Pimpin' at it's greatest. No one man has been through as much as Iceberg Slim in the Pimp Game. In, 2006 would be the best time to have it out. But, mark my words this will make people open thier eyes to how trife life can be. THIS WILL BE THE BEST PIMP MOVIE EVER MADE."
4,Pimp,I just started reading this book and it reminds me of Manchild in the Promseland. Which was a great book.
3,Street knowledge,"I saw Dave Chappelle a few months ago and he mentioned Iceberg Slim. Part of his act included how Slim kept his main woman by his side. That sparked my curiousity and I ordered the book. If you're not street savvy, you will definitely have to review the colorful glossary of terms. Although the print was awfully small and blurry in some places, I found it to be speedy and educational read. It offers a lot of insight and sheds light not only on the lifestyle, but the mentality it takes to succeed in a seedy and illegal business."
5,PIMP OR SIMP ?,"THIS BOOK IS REAL DEEP ONCE YOU PICK IT UP YOU CAN'T PUT IT DOWN. FOR ALL OF YOU YOUNG CATS WHO WANT TO KNOW ABOUT ""THE PIMP GAME"" IT WILL DO JUST THAT. FOR ALL YOU OTHER CATS WHO JUST WANT TO LEARN TO USE SOME OF THE RULES OF THE PIMP GAME IN DEALING WITH WOMEN AND IN LIFE IT WILL DO THAT AS WELL. BE PREPARED THOUGH ITS NOT A STEP BY STEP GUIDE TO PIMPIN BUT THE LIFE AND TIMES OF ICEBERG SLIM WHICH WHEN YOU READ WILL GIVE YOU THE EXPERIENCE TO COME UP YOUR OWN WITH A STEP BY STEP GUIDE FOR THE PIMP GAME OR WHAT EVER GAME YOU WANT TO APPLY IT TO. COP IT AND THE NAKED SOUL OF ICEBERG SLIM ALSO THEY GO HAND AND HAND."
5,Great video,"When this virtual nature video came out, I thought it was the most incredible imaginary video. Someone borrowed it and never returned it. I was very pleased to find it again."
2,Don't waste your time or money on this...,"...unless you've never read any of his other books. Don't get me wrong, I can't say enough good things about Robert Kiyosaki's books. If you haven't read them (Rich Dad Poor Dad, Cashflow Quadrant, etc.), I highly recomemd that you do. But there's nothing new in this book. It just a retread of ideas already presented in his other books, and not as well. If fact, reading it felt like a advertisment for his other books and products."
5,Powerful information for those who are perceptive,Powerful! Powerful! Powerful.That is the best way I can describe this book by Robert Kiyosaki. If you are tired of hearing how you have to cut up your credit cards to prevent debt then you must read this new book by RTK. It is his best ever!
1,Blatant promotional vehicle,I am in the process of listening to books on CD as my job involoves a good deal of driving. I listenend to Rich Dad / Poor Dad and was invigorated. I decided to add this book on CD to my list. I just got done with it and actually skipped many parts as i felt that it was strictly a vehicle to promote other Kiyosaki products. There were really no new ideas in this book. Don't waste your time or money.
1,Rich Dad is fake!,"This book shows how Robert has been lying all along. He talks about how he bought his dream car while being homeless. Ok then, how did Robert make the monthly payment? Why would he be stupid enough to sleep in a Porsch as a bum? This guy is such a liar and is trying to con the masses. He is a conman and a good one. Thats why hes a motivational speaker. It takes a good speaker to con you out of your hard earned money. Don't fall for this conman! This book contradicts what Robert has been preaching in previous books. Robert says pay off your debt while he says he bought his dream car while being homeless. That would be odd but it isn't odd because Robert is a professional liar."
1,Not much content,"This book was dissapointing, it doesn't offer sufficientlyprecise advise except on cutting personal debt. The rest isvague and frequently refers to the knowledge found in otherRich Dad book. Save your money to buy one of the better ones."
5,Teaching to be financially smart.,"This book teaches you to be financially smart with the use of credit cards and that you don't have to cut up your credit cards, but to be financially smart when using them wisely. Credit card companies are just waiting for you to make a mistake and in the world of investing and your portfolio is your report card. Just like in school you've got to maintain that B average and shoot for that A+ card and keep fixing all the little mistakes until you do achieve it."
1,Or not.,"The first book was mildly interesting and intriguing. This one? Not so much. I'll tell you right now what it's about:-It has more (fake) dialogue between the author and the Rich Dad-Own a business-Buy housesThat's about it. If you're considering buying this, you're just making Kiyosaki a little wealthier."
3,Rehash of previous material,"Nothing new in this book that hasn't already been mentioned in his other books.Forget about getting rich with this guys advise.Get a good broker and invest on the Dow, is my advice to you.The only person who is gonna get rich from this book is the guy who wrote it."
3,It was too real,"The movie did a good job conveying the message from the book, while keeping some dignity for Precious. I would recommend this movie to adults."
4,precious,"we first saw it on the Oprah network,and decided to see it uncut and without commercials every 2 minutes. It draws you right in to the characters. Really good job by the whole cast. I will watch it again. Caution about the language for younger viewers. It paints a very clear picture of things wrong with inner cities."
4,"Precious: Based on the Novel ""Push"" by Sapphire",A very compelling movie that broaches a subject that is hard and painful...great movie...I love the ending!!! Her mother is quite a piece of work!!!
5,This Movie Finds You,"This is actually difficult to explain, but ""Precious"" is a surpassingly fantastic movie.It is also a difficult movie. I hated the first 1/2 hour - almost viscerally. This is a loser world; these are losers - LOSERS, and the ""mom"" - wow! She is the lowest ever. Almost everything about this whole world is breathtakingly bleak and repulsive and unfixable.But this movie really does something fantastic - it takes your mind and carefully brings you into a deeper thicket of humanness. I don't even remember how it happened. But it really did and it is an unexpected and unusual surprise.Oh, and if you know anyone who has any ""mom"" issues, this movie will touch that base.(one final note - Mariah Carey has a role and she is perfect - blew me away; didn't know it was her until the credits.)"
3,Okay.,"Strange feelings about this one. It really is not a pleasant movie and it actually started to make us feel depressed about half-way through. I also have to wonder that if this film was made by white film-makers, it would be called racist. Mo'nique was good, but is that the kind of character that anyone wants to play? I mean, the movies biggest flaw is that with all the negative actions and stereotypes on screen, there is no real call-to-arms to change things. Maybe as an afterschool special that provided Abuse Hot Line numbers or Welfare Fraud statistics it would have felt more worthwhile."
4,One of the best movies of the year.,"One of the best movies of the year so far. Sidibe and Monique's performances are Oscar worthy. I also loved the overall treatment of the movie.With such a complex subject it was very smart of the director (Lee Daniels) not to use a heavy hand. When I saw the trailers for the movie, I was afraid of that. I was expecting an overdose of melodrama and over-wrought background scores relegating a powerful story to Hallmark-ish crap.But thankfully Daniels has managed to evade all those trappings. Instead of taking a shortcut and going for the visceral emotional response, Daniels has succeeded in making us really think about the character's plight and the more bigger social implications.So thank you Mr. Daniels."
2,"Oops, the screenwriter forgot the plot","I'm not the first person to point out that this movie doesn't have much of a plot (I'm being generous). It's a pity because the performances are first-rate (especially Mo'Nique). Also, there isn't a proper ending. If this is supposed to be a movie about overcoming adversity, then it has a funny way of going about it. And let's not mention the plot holes you could drive a truck through..."
3,OK,"STORY OF AN OVER WEIGHT, ILLITERATE AND PREGNANT BLACK GIRL WHO EVERYONE LAUGHED AT. A GOOD STORY WITH A HAPPY ENDING"
4,Good book!,"Precious Jones is a illiterate African american girl that also has to deal with inner city school violence. In addition to this she gets emotional, physically and sexually abused at home by her father and mother. Just when you think her life has gotten real bad, her life gets even worse! Precious gets kicked out of school due to her pregnancy. She then gives birth to a downs syndrome baby.......sad but her life takes an even bigger turn. Read it you will love it!"
5,Wonderful.,"This is such a wonderful film. The performances are out of this world. I can't say enough good things about it. I hope all the cast and crew take the Oscars by storm!!! If you want to watch a movie that will move you, this is the safest bet for that."
1,Amazon Sucks,"I can't give this movie any stars because the movie would not load,so Amazon is not high on my list since they charged me for a movie that I told them would not load .and thet still charged me.so in my opinoin Amazon sucks and I will never use their services ever again"
3,This is a review of the blu ray disc not the movie,This isn't one of the top blu ray movies that I have seen. This could be due to the original filming. I haven't seen this on dvd but I don't think it could look that much different then this blu ray.
4,Precious,This was the first movie I had ever seen that shows real life as it is. The way she took back control from her mom was awesome. Her mom was evil and heartless. Precious has every reason to be proud of all she accomplished. Great movie
1,No,"I was a public health nurse. Yes, in fact, people do live this way, surprise surprise. Unfortunately this film inspires more racism than sympathy, my opinion only. I am not sure what the purpose of this movie was, but it was not entertaining. Also,too melodramatic, as others have said."
4,Great Movie,This is a great movie. The topic is cruel but real. If you have the opportunity to see the
5,Incredible!,Wow. I bought this movie on impulse recently and have watched it 3 times so far. Incredible acting. Gripping story; so well told. I love it.
2,Overrated crap,"Yes, overrated crap. I give this one two stars on the strength of Monique's performance. Many times we have seen this story of abused and underprivileged youth making good in the world, only those other films had a point. Technically, I've seen better films shot on super 8mm. There was even one shot in the classroom where I saw the boom/microphone enter frame. And if I have to see that same trailer again, the one with Precious blubbering about how unloved she is, I'm going to sue the studio."
1,NOTORIOUS -33/10,"I recently watched the movie precious it was disgusting, vulgar, & grotesque I thought I was watching a ZOMBIEWEEN, but then forgot who was directing this monstrosity. Yeah it was Tyler Perry a.k.a. Madea & Oprah Winfrey all throughout this filth, is assault, abuse, unspeakable acts & if you are actually inspired by this movie, well see ya in court on tuesday or with a s.w.a.t. team at your house amigo"
2,"Ever heard of the words ""personal responsibility?""","I found this movie both incredibly derivative and predictable. We have seen this program over and over and over again, on Oprah, Jerry Springer or on those so-called reality shows (didn't MTV and VH1 used to specialize in music?). Practically every black female author uses a variation of this plot line ad nauseum. This is less ""exposing"" reality than misandrist wish-fulfillment, which in its own way perpetuates racism by perpetuating stereotypes. The only difference between this movie (and novel) and a typical Springer show is that being obese, unattractive, uneducated like ""Precious"" can not ""always"" be explained by being the victim of a rapist father, uncle or brother--or mother. Maybe the inner city environment is to blame, or maybe she has personality defects, or isn't interested in eating properly or the way she looks. Maybe she's bored in school. Maybe she's has violent tendencies herself. Maybe she just doesn't care."
1,Very depressing!,"I watched this movie for the first time last night and found it to be a very depressing movie. Yes Monique did a good job, but it was so depressing. I'm very happy that she won an Oscar for best supporting actress in this film. Monique is a very talented Woman and did deserve to win an Oscar.The beginning was very boring. I would not recommend anyone to purchase this movie. Yes these things really happens in real life. This is a reality for a lot of people unfortunately, but I would not want to have this type of movie in my library. I am so happy I did not go to the movie theater to watch this movie."
2,Precious,"This movie should have a warning label!!!!!It hit to close to home for me and I was depressed and should not have watched it!But, All the actors was great!"
1,I want the two hours of my life back,This movie was a total and utter waste of time and money. I have no clue why this movie has received so much attention or any awards for that matter. The acting was only so so (at best) and the plot was so over the top! If I could give it less than one start I would... maybe a half a start... maybe
2,Disgusting,Precious is a uneducated grotesquely Obese girl who is molested by both Parents. Her mom is a mean ignorant nasty woman. Ok movie nothing special. kind of just makes you sick to think that there are really people out there living this way.
3,it had it's moments,"the story left too many questions; precious, her mother, her father all very dark skinned, where did she get a light skinned baby with what's called ""good hair""? movie showed too much of her abuse and not enough of how she climbed up to her eventual freedom. Why was the father only shown when he abused her and then ""poof"" no more daddy. Also, there was waaaaayyyyyy to much vulgarity. Monique did a great job with her character at the end of the movie - long way from ""hey professor ogelvie."" She really portrayed so much of what is seen today, women choosing men over their children. Her character finaly realized what she'd given up, but it was too late. Unfortunately,. some women never realize. How sad,"
4,Good Product,"My local harware store wanted to sell me a gallon jug- I felt that was going to be a ""lifetime"" supply, so I wasplease to be able to order this small size."
4,smooth blending,This was purchased for my 13 year old daughter who is on a swim team and is starving after swim laps. She loves the pocket size and the variety of smoothies offered. The blending techniques at the forward were helpful and the recipes fun and delicious.
1,Almost useless.,This product literally fell apart in my hands while using it to sharpen a axe. I will say that it did indeed sharpen the axe a little bit. but before I could finish I had a handful of white and gray sand in my hand.
1,More garbage,The garbage doesn't stop. Kool Moe Dee releases more garbage.Don't buy this album you will be disapointed.
2,Misleading title - good sounding recipes.,"I thought this cookbook would include recipes that only required one pan to make, ie ""one dish meals"". Unfortunately, this is not the case. Some of these recipes require a fry pan, two bowls and a pot to make. There are some good sounding recipes in here, but most require 10-15 ingredients (some exotic) and so require some planning (going to the store) and preparation. I think I am probably their target audience - I enjoy cooking but I don't have a lot of time - but I think they missed their target with this book."
4,Great!,"This cookbook has never let us down! There are wonderful flavor combinations and they have been a hit each time I've tried a new dish.The only problem is that it implies they are ""one dish"" meals. You will often need to use more than one cooking vessel. Since I would do that anyway, I don't think that's a big issue.A Great buy!!!"
5,Change that doesn't create resistance!,"I've been consulting for organization change for 20 years from small human service agencies to the Boeing Company. Terms of Engagement is a real winner. The principles are profound and provide a basis for change that truely involves the whole organization. I've noticed that many organization improvement efforts actually create resentment and resistance. The approaches outlined in Terms of Engagement move quickly and actually create change instead of merely plans for change. It fits old economy industry and new economy startups. Buy it, then do the work."
5,Mystic Medusa's Soul Mating,"As always Mystic Medusa is right on the mark with her witty writing style that indicates not only her passion for astrology but her knowledge of it.As with her everyday horoscopes, when it comes to describing your sign and reviewing compatibility, Mystic does it with flair and accuracy.FOr anyone who reads her online horoscopes or those in the Newspapers, her books are worth a look.And if you are yet to become familiar with Mystic, here is a good place to start.Entertaining, Insightful, and a must for anyone interested in Astrology."
4,All holes not drilled all the way or are missing,"I had two corners which were a bit messed up from shipping but my biggest concern is that both side wall pieces weren't drilled completely. There were mounting holes which were drilled on one side and marked on the other side but not drilled at all. Also, about 10% of the holes for the height adjustment of the shelves were just barely drilled into the end pieces and needed to be further drilled to accommodate the adjustment hardware. Overall, this is a very nice bookshelf though. I have the book shelf fully loaded and it seems to be handling the weight well."
4,Great book shelf,"Book case arrived quickly, was relatively easy to assemble and is a solid, good looking addition to our office. Thanks!"
2,Disappointing,"I longed for these earrings for weeks, but was so disappointed when I got them. They are a nice color, but a little too large for my tastes and a bit too heavy. So sad..."
3,The truth will set you free,"I read this book with the expectation that the answer would be 'yes', but I also found out why it is 'no' most of the time. It helped me to discover that although I tend to avoid romantic relationships with the opposite sex in favor of non physical friendships, my actions show that I really am desiring an romantic realationship. It tells how to avoid sending mixed messages via actions or body language and how to not substitute 'need' for real friendship. I am disappointed that I will have to most likely forgo the possibility of having many male friends, but the truth that I found in this book has set me free from those false expectations."
2,A Lackluster Western,"Apart from some impressive scenery and a nifty train-wreck climax, Clint Eastwood's ""Joe Kidd"" (1972) is an uninspired, dreary affair that resembles a made-for-TV movie. Director John Sturges simply goes through the motions and a fine supporting cast (including Robert Duvall and John Saxon) is wasted. Judging by the film's lackluster quality, it's easy to see why Eastwood directed his remaining Westerns."
1,One of Eastwood's poorest films,"In between acting in Don Siegel's classic DIRTY HARRY and directing the stunning HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER, Eastwood performed in the boring and bland JOE KIDD. Director John Sturges, who had once helmed such classic action pictures as BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK and THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, appears not to have cared one bit about the film and directs sluggishly. Even the action scenes, what few there are, drag. Eastwood's character is a pale version of ""The Man With No Name""; he goes through the motions of the legendary persona, but without the mystique. The picture has some pretty location photography, and the climatic set-piece of a train crashing through a saloon is quite clever (although completely out of place) but ohterwise, JOE KIDD is a snore. Clint completist only need apply -- the appeal of a DVD edition may make them fork over the cash, but it'll probably collect dust on the shelf."
2,A Little Stale,"Clint Eastwood rarely stars in a bad movie, but that's not to say this is bad, it just falls a bit flat. A good cast, including a deliciously villainous Robert Duvall unfortunately fail to lift this picture above mediocrity. Add to this, it's relatively short running time (just under 90 minutes), fans of the genre, and Clint (who have been spoiled by great movies before) will feel a little let down. It's probably fair to say that a lesser known cast, and director wouldn't even have got this movie off the cutting room floor. All this said, any Clint collector will probably want it in his/her collection, and the usual amount of dry humor, and Eastwoodesque rationality does make this watchable, if not that memorable."
3,Not a Complete Film on this Universal DVD,"Scenes are missing on this DVD by Universal. Besides Kidd's and Helen's personal scene that's not apparent, what about the missing dinner scene at Helen's cabin? Duvall and Stroud reveal their characters even more at the dinner table but it is not shown on this version. Duvall invites a reluctant Helen to the table and takes command for himself. This film gets no respect by not being complete."
3,Just Okay,"I really wanted to like this film a lot: what with Clint and Robert Duvall starring together.But it's just not a very good film. It has the flavor of classic Clint and the western drama but lacks the substance. The story line is too improbable for even the most ardent fan. The dialogue and action are slow and drawn out. Like molasses.And the climax is just plain limp.Fortunately, there are so many great Clint westerns to choose from - Hang'em High, Good, Bad, and the Ugly trio, The Outlaw Josey Wales (one of Clint's favorites) that the viewer can still enjoy wonderful westerns of the highest quality - but this isn't one of them.Three stars."
4,Standard Clint.,"Standard Clint. what else do i need to say. If you dont know classic clint ...please watch ""The Good The Bad and the Ugly"" first. Then worry about this one.That being said this is a pretty good one...with a decent job done by Robert Duval the bad guy.6/10 Clint scale8/10 regular western scale."
3,"Not Eastwood's best, but not bad","This film seems to catch alot of flack, but is really not all that bad. While admittedly somewhat slow moving, it nonetheless has some good action, some interesting characters, good location filming, and a fairly interesting storyline. I have seen it many times, and while it is not the greatest western around, it is worth watching."
2,"Not one of my favorites, but a good performance by Duvall","Joe Kidd is not one of my favorite Eastern westerners (and Eastwood is my favorite, hands down, when it comes to films, and the Western is my favorite genre), but it does feature a good performance by Robert Duvall as the heavy. Clint's character is a little too reigned in in this one for my taste, until at the end he runs a steam engine through the town in order to extract some vengeance from Duvall's baddie.A good supporting cast (as is typical in an Eastwood flick), also featuring John Saxon and Don Stroud."
3,"Good effort, albeit too short - and even shorter on DVD - get VHS copies while you can!","Several important scenes are missing fromthe DVD print! Eastwood, even drunken inhere, is fine and Duvall and Stella Garciaare scene stealers, as well! Hawai'i Five-0vet, Don Stroud, who has a fine website, issolid too. Could have been 20 minutes longerwith proper character development! Train be-ing run through Courthouse at end is classic.John Saxon is not 100% satisfying as Mexicalibandito, though...Three stars on either 4 or 5star scale."
3,EASTWOOD CAN MAKE ALMOST ANYTHING WORK.....ALMOST!,"I like Clint Eastwood and for the most part I enjoy his films. 'Joe Kidd' is certainly OK entertainment, but from Eastwood we expect a little more. This is just not one of his better efforts and surprisingly this is one of Robert Duvall's most disappointing performances that I've seen. It's slow moving and makes little sense and also has one of the stupidest endings in the history of film! ......All Aboard! Woo Woo! ;-b"
2,Missing too much,"I, too, am disappointed they excluded the most important parts to this movie/storyline, Joe Kidd's growing suspicion he's signed on with the devil, as in the missing supper shots in the mountain cabin, and again with his romantic interest with Helen Sanchez, and her growing resentment with Luis Chama, as expressed in the copse of trees AFTER he disappoints her on the mountain. This causes major discontinuities. With plenty of room left on this DVD, it should have been easily retained. This print looks like it came out of the cuts they made for late night TV where they would fill two hour time slots with a minimum of 30 minutes of commercials, and any movie over one and a half hours would be trimmed at the engineers will. Too bad they couldn't find the original... or is that going to come on the ""Platinum Collection""...."
3,not vintage Petroski,"Although much of this contains great info and history behind such everyday items as the paper clip or the fax machine, I found it far too wordy on each subject. I love Henry Petroski's books but only really when he talks about bridges or buildings. I just found I was skipping pages after awhile as it really never held my attention like his other books do."
2,an over elaborated dull story,There is a lot of interesting information and many good insights buried in this book. But I only recommend it to speed readers or the truly determined.
1,Boring book,This book draged on and on on the history of the fork. Poorly written and hard to follow.
1,Redundant and Boring,"If you like to read the fine print in contracts, you'll find this book interesting. If you're a fan of ""How Things Work"" and similar titles, steer clear of this snoozer.The book should have been a pamphlet reading ""form follows failure."" I'd be interested in getting an electronic version of the book to find out just how often that phrase is repeated, it must appear fifty times per chapter."
3,"Fascinating insights, a little dry","Henry Petroski writes an indepth look at how everyday items evolve. He thesis, which he rarely tires of repeating, is that the form of an object follows its failure. He rejects the saying ""form follows function"" as being quaint and incomplete. He uses numerous examples of the evolution of the paperclip, fork, scotch tape and other common items to illustrate that objects change not due to far sighted design, but instead to users finding fault with how the object does its job and trying to improve it. The book can be a little dry and repetitive at times but offers fascinating insights into why a fork has four tines or why the paperclip looks the way it does."
3,Promising book but...,"This book contains snipets of information about the development of everyday items. Is generaly easy to read and informative, but it could have been better."
4,"Also check out Basalla ""The Evolution of Technology""","If you're interested in the history of modern technology, George Basalla's book ""The Evolution of Technology"" is also very good. However, it is more academic and is not structured around such familiar examples, but nevertheless it is still easily accessible to the educated layperson.I haven't read Petroski, but I did see his very interesting invited keynote talk at OOPSLA 2001. We read Basalla's book in one of the graduate seminars I took on the history of technology."
3,Interesting but incomplete,"Henry Petroski uses many examples to drive home REPEATEDLY his points that Irritation is the Mother of Invention, and that function doesn't dictate form. His presentation is convincing, and I enjoyed his discussion of the evolution of the paperclip. By the time he got to the trials of inventing the zipper it had begun to drag.Of course it does take multiple examples to prove a point. But my real objection to the book isn't what it includes, but what it leaves out. Irritation may be the reason many inventions get started, but Mr. Petroski leaves out all mention of why they get finished, the sublime joy of coming up with something new and actually seeing it work."
4,An interesting look at the development of everyday objects,"Things get improved because in their current form, they do not work properly. Henry Petroski's book, The Evolution of Useful Things, traces the development of objects in our everyday life, including detailed histories of the development of the staple, the zipper, silverware, and hand tools. The book is interesting, although Petroski does tend to shy away from offering a theory of development, and instead offers a conjectures about how things might have developed. He explains, but he does not offer a theory or an argument that explains everything. Overall, though, a goos book, well researched, well illustrated, and interesting on many levels."
2,Delivers less than promised,"Mr. Petroski labors at too much length to describe how several common items became what they are today as a result of the design process and subsequent evolution as a result of engineers' continual desires for improvment. This exercise is less successful than earlier works which focused on the engineering process and used infrastructure projects such as buildings and bridges for examples.Lay readers, and even engineers, would be better served by reading ""Remaking the World"" or ""To Engineer Is Human"" which provide more insight into the engineering process and which are more relevant and connected to the common structures and objects that we take for granted every day."
1,Most useless textbook ever,I do not understand why instructors use this textbook. It seems as if the writers of the text and the writers of the problems have nothing to do with each other because the problems focus on topics that were never covered in the text. The problems also seem to focus on things that have no meaning. I learned more from an online Harvard Business School tutorial on accounting than I learned from this textbook. It is just god awful.
1,"Agree with the other reviewers, this book is awful",This book is hands down one of the worst textbooks I have ever tried to read. I'd more monotonous that reading a foreign dictionary that you don't understand and just as unintelligible.I am incredibly disappointed in my professors for using this book as part of their class as it has done nothing to aid my confusion and everything to worsen it.I'm sorry for anyone who tries to read this. The authors should be ashamed of themselves.
1,Absolutely terrible,"Agreeing with the majority of the other posts-- this textbook is by far the worst I have ever used. I had previously taken financial accounting (undergrad), and had to solely use my old textbook in replacement of this one for my MBA financial accounting course. Completely useless, waste of money."
4,Decent Book,"This is a decent book. It is mostly well written and full of practical examples. In fairness, if you are looking for a book that you can extract the material without reading the text (handbook style) than this isn't it. The authors organize the book in a unique way. They discuss financial reports in some detail and then reiterate the reports in individual chapters. At first it was frustratingly redundant; however, it was also an effective organization for thoroughly learning the material."
1,Too much info for nothing!!!,"Every time I read any line or chapter I end up being more confused, not a single chapter is complete, "" this chapter's concept in that chapter"" and so on.tables and tables...like if you read engineering book all you see are the graphs and tables with no explanation this is what this book looks like.Authors made my first course of MBA, a hell, when I could have done much better..."
1,worse book i have ever used,This book was absolutely terrible it is overly complex in no way easy to read. it literally makes everything more complicated. this book is worse than Hitler drowning puppies. i threw it off of my dorms roof halfway through the semester. the authors of this book should be absolutely ashamed of themselves. i deeply believe any person who picks up this book will hate it.
2,not a good book for beginners,"the whole structure of the book is ot comprehensible. it gives out 3 financial statements at the first 3 chapters, without letting the readers to have time digest the concepts. after you are confused enough, the book will then introduce concepts of each items listed in the statements, and have you look back at the first three chapters.the layout is not good either. for some chapters, you need to turn the pages back and forth, again and again, because the text content and the illustration table are back to back.the book is just very confusing."
3,Good book - provided that you have face-to-face instruction,"I am an MBA student at Chicago. Read three first chapters, can't understand why people have so much heat about it. The book seems to be good - although, a class instruction may be very helpful."
2,"unclear, disorganized, vague language","The title pretty much sums it up, I think this book is pretty bad."
5,Magik Brushes,"The Magik brushes are great for taking lint off clothes, cleaning the felt near the rim of the dryer filter, and, especially, for removing pet fur from anything. I've given them to family and the people for whom I cat-sit. It makes removing cat hair from cushions, etc. fast. You swipe your hand the opposite direction and the hair comes off. It is reusable and lasts for years."
2,Doesn't Cut It,"I was hopeful that this brush would work like a charm due to positive reviews, but unfortunately, it just doesn't do a well enough job on my wool coat. I have bought 99 cent lint brushes that have worked just as well as this brush. It just doesn't do a good job of removing pet hair and other lint from my coat."
1,Sucks,"Piece of crap. It broke the first day I used it. The red felt separated from the plastic handle. I was sent a new one, but the quality on this thing is sub par. Do not buy it."
1,Lasted ONE Brushing!,"Wow, what a horrible item. I did not purchase this through Amazon, but at another retailer. On its FIRST use, the fabric part of the brush separated from the actual plastic holder. The fabric is not secure AT ALL. And it is pieced into the plastic holder, a separate piece on front and back, so that both sides can easily become separated from the holder. Never purchased something this useless before. To make matters worse, there was no way to re-attach the fabric back into the ""teeth"" of the holder, so it was tossed into the garbage. Why aren't companies held liable for selling worthless items?????? Yes, I am angry."
5,Great product!,"I bought this because I was tired of buying the roller type ones, they cost money and they are quite annoying. This works great especially since I have 2 dogs and my husky tends to shed like crazy at certain times. It can esily be cleaned and reused, and you get your money's worth."
5,Awesome for cat hair,"I have several of these in the house. Sure, they are great for getting cat hair and lint off of your clothing, but they also work wonders on couches and area rugs too! If you own cats, these are a must for your house!"
1,Save your money,"As far as removing white lint from dark clothing, cotton sweats, the majik brush flat doesn't work. It doesn't even get close. So save your money. It doesn't even deserve one starI'm returning it out of spite even thou it will cost more than the refund I'll get back"
3,A hard read.,I had a hard time forcing myself to finish this novel. The book is too full of intrigue to a point where it became too confusing to understand all the characters. I will not read another Stella Cameron.
2,Don't Turn Around,"MMMMM, yeah baby, this is some serious love making music! Too bad I can't stand love or making it. Luther may have had one hit in the 70s, but this thing has no hits. If you like guys who sound like Tina Turner, you may dig this. I wish Ike would have beat Luther Ingram."
3,How quickly things date...,"When it was first produced, Leo Fall's ""The Dollar Princess"" was the latest thing in operetta, with its chorus of typists and its sharp satirical book. The title character, who runs her father's company, hires a man to be her secretary, and falls reluctantly in love. (Hepburn-Tracy, anyone?) Meanwhile, an adventuress schemes to marry the father, and a secondary couple sort out their own romance. When this version was mounted for television in 1971, the producers treated it like a Broadway show, souping up the arrangements and trimming down the more extended music. (The big waltz survives as a party entertainment.) There are some nice tunes--though none of them operetta classics--performed in earnest by an attractive cast. The result, alas, looks just as dated now as the original must have looked to them, but if you're not a purist, there's a good deal of fun to be had. Clear subtitles, nice booklet."
1,IF YOU LOVE OPERETTAS DON'T FALL IN LOVE WITH SUCH DVD,THIS IS A REAL OFFENCE TO THE ORIGINAL OPERETTA AND THE EXTRAORDINARILY BEAUTIFUL MUSIC OF LEO FALL IS RE-ORCHESTRATED WHICH MEANS THAT THOSE TV PEOPLE ARE THE GREATEST ENNEMIES OF OPERETTAS. THIS DVD HAS ONLY ONE PLACE: THE GARBAGE CAN.Ernesto Oppicelli - Genoa/Italy
2,you can get better info for free on the net,"this book confused me. why did it need to be so mathmatically challenging? i don't want formulas and percentages.....just tell me what to do and how to do it. this plan is a good one, and i found better, easier to follow info on the net for free. i'm using maybe 5 pages out of this entire book to supplement the info i found. find it on clearance or borrow someone's copy."
4,Forty-Five Minutes from Broadway,"For anyone who has been searching for a recording of George M. Cohan's classic musical, this is far from a disappointment. The sound is digitally remastered, and the songs are enjoyable. One would hardly suspect the music is almost one hundred years old and the soundtrack more than forty. Besides the catchy tunes, there are insightful dialogue outtakes from the musical itself. This is a must for any Cohan fan and/or any one who has performed in a modern stage version of this ""melifluous (which mean ""sweetly flowing"" in case you were wondering) musical merriment."""
5,Wonderful,"I read the author's Frosting on the Cake and found that a character in this book was an Asian American lesbian. It is so rare that I had to read the novel that inspired that short story. This was a great read and I think thatthe author, who I assume is white, did a good job portraying the struggles of an Asian American lesbian. I would love to meet this character sometime! But based on the short story it seems she's in a happy relationship. (grin) Some people might wish that the character was not Asian but I for one am glad that the author choose to do it."
4,Love on the Freeway,"I am an avid reader of lesbian fiction ,book seller and writer. Reading Karin Kallmakers books are always a delight. I am completing the reading her entire body of work ,as her writing have been mastered as a wonderful story teller.This book is as varied as all of her different plots and enjoyable characters. I enjoyed Carpool the book kept me waiting for the final resolution I recommend this highly."
4,Easy and fun read over and over.,"This is one of Karen Kallmaker's most fun books for me to read. The story is interesting and enjoyable and I have reread it more than any of her other books. It sticks with me and I find myself remembering the characters many months later and I wonder what they are doing now. This dosen't generally happen to me with fiction books. Get it, it's fun."
3,Pretty good,"This was a pretty good book, but not the best I've read. It centers around an upper class woman and a lower-class woman who work at the same company. They fall for each other (of course) but find many obstacles in the way to their happiness. They find something important at work and prepare to be the whistle blowers. This was written in a different time, in the 90s, when people were just starting to come out en mass. The time period the book is written in is very important to the story line. Overall, it was a good book. It isn't something I'd buy again if given the choice, but it isn't something I'm going to get rid of, either."
1,Beyond Belief,"I agree with reviewer Jane's ire concerning Ms. Kallmaker'sliterary focus. Personally, I read Ms. Kallmaker's work because shedoes have a gift for prose. In Car Pool, she makes her characterstotally believable and their situations plausible. I have given herthe benefit of the doubt in the past; reading her stories voraciously;hoping her genre would become a bit more ethnically inclusive. Thelesbian character in Car Pool who is an Asian American is a fairstart. Unfortunately, black lesbians have (at worst) been absentor... at best, been marginalized in Ms.Kallmaker's writings. It isbeyond belief how such an obvious talent can also be so narrow andbackward in her thinking. I wonder if she has any black friends (gayor otherwise)."
2,Carpool,"Carpool was disappointing. I am not thrilled with Ms. Kallmaker's character choices. Why? They offer no ethnic diversity. Why, what do you mean? One of the main characters is Asian...surely this is an effort at diversity in Karin's writing? True, but, frankly, she could just as well have been a Black lesbian...perhaps the HARDER choice for Ms. Kallmaker who is probably aware that a large percentage of her audience consists of white lesbians. It seems that the lives and the presences of black lesbians are never treated in any of Ms. Kallmaker's writings...except for a minor appearance by some big breasted, Mammie-type,women's shelter worker in Touchwood...whom the lead character, Rayanne Germaine, promptly wanted suckling or something from...okay? Plantation flash-back... Anyhoos, Carpool was a let-down."
2,"Quality OK, Color not as advertised","Received the ""Oil Rubbed Bronze"" version of this part and immediately thought I got the wrong part because it looks straight black. Further research on other sites confirms that the color on this part is an issue. It is basically black and will likely NOT match your oil rubbed/Venetian bronze faucet. Be aware."
4,Fun game,This game is great to play with kids. Game play is fast so no one is left sitting to wait too long and the graphics can be skipped altogether for really impatient ones. There are two modes to play in to keep things interesting. There are drawbacks though. Playing more than twice or three times gets repetitive and my kids lose interest in seeing the same things over and over. I also wish there were different options as far as scenery or things to buy with the money you earn. Most of the times you end up at the end of the game with loads of cash and nothing to spend it on.
1,WACK!!!,This is one of the top ten wackest rap cds ever.Everything on here is stupid.The beats are horrible and Kool's lyrics are similar to a pre-k student (who probably wrote the songs).Stay away from this piece of garbage.You will be truly dissapointed.Peace Out.
5,Excellent Book for any MBA student,This book is a must read for any MBA student concerned with the strategy that their company is going to be taking in the long run. Mr. Bradshaws book is a good read and very informative. This is the stuff that they dont teach you in business school. He is also an excellent speaker who spoke to our Georgia Tech MBA class.
2,LOST THE A/V CABLE NOW IT'S WORTHLESS!!,"This is a fine unit and does everything advertised EXCEPT:I have lost the a/v cable and cannot find a replacement. Apex customer service is a joke, so that avenue is out.It's a 2.5mm to RCA A/V connection (the three rca male connections; red, white & yellow) and I use this for displaying photos & video through a projector... which worked great until I lost the cable!Now I use the iPod.I still have this thing and would like to have it as a backup but my inability to locate the proper cable has me shaking my head and looking at the unit on my desk as it keeps papers from blowing off as I sigh.If any of you millions reading these reviews know where I could find the a/v cable for this, I will paypal you $10. I'm totally serious."
1,Apex makes junk that breaks in months and doesnt fix it,"Apex Digital products often fail within the first year. They have horrible customer service, false advertising, and fail to honor their warranties. Please check www.labbb.gov (Better Business Bureau) and search for Apex Digital to see the F rating the better business bureau has given them. Saving 10-15 dollars is not worth the hassle they cause."
4,Slender volume but most interesting read,"At a young age, the author Clara Pinto-Correia heard about the long extinct dodo and became fascinated by the bird's fate. The end result is a well-researched and well-written text that takes the reader from the shores of Europe to a small chain of islands where the dodo and it's genetic cousins made their homes.Sadly, the dodo and it's genetic cousins were doomed to extinction with the arrival of Europeans (starting with the Portuguese). The plump, flightless animals were slow breeders with a single offspring per mating season and no natural enemies. Add ravenous creatures (Homo sapiens included) into their safe mircosphere and diaster was assured.Pinto-Correia traces the few captive dodos in Euorpe and the fates of their remains. Now, the only things the modern world has of the dodo are a scattering of bones, some paintings and sketches and the cultural understanding that to be a dodo is to be doomed.A must read for the natural history reader or devotee."
2,All over the place,"I have read a lot on the dodo, but I'm afraid this wasn't one of the better books. Half of the book is not actually about dodos but deals with Portugese and Dutch shipping and history - the dodo isn't really mentioned in depth until a few chapters in, and then it is faffed about with and dragged out on very little information. Sadly disappointing as there are so few resources on the topic, but perhaps of interest to people who aren't so keen on the dodo details. As above, I would recommend Fuller or even Strickland."
4,Works well. Packaging a key.,"Only thing that takes a little getting used to is the G-Max flushing system, which seems to work for just one second, then stops. But so far, gets job done.Important point - packaging thought through; item components were very well insulated in well-fitting packaging, unlike was the case for the matching toilet bowl I also ordered from Amazon that arrived broken. A replacement bowl, properly packaged, survived shipment with no damage."
3,Book two of a good series,"Adrian's web, Now this wasn't the best Saberhagen book, the I have ever read, but don't get me wrong, it was still very good. Compared to the first book, Adrians web is less wonderous, but it is still just as strong in the writing and the flow of words. The imaginative aspect of fantasy books is there and while these is no ""Lord of The Rings"" it is still a very well crafted and interesting tale, that all should read"
2,"Concept good, but disappointing","I'm a Saberhagen fan from way back, but I had to force myself to finish this second part of the Gods series. It's a great concept, the use of 'faces of the gods' but I had higher hopes in it's execution. The story development is too broken up, goes out of it's way to be roundabout, and the characters I wished more of didn't pan out. Frankly, this is a good short story stretched way too long. No book three for me."
3,Decent,"It gives you a decent idea of the technical and mathematical issuesinvolved in pairs trading - statistical arbitrage and takeover arbitrage.Some of the math explanations are weak -- he doesn't tellthe whole story, sort of fuzzes it up. As a result, I couldn'tget all the math (and I am a professional mathematician).As for non-experts, my experience is that glossing overthe details does not make it easier, but impossible.A good book for your second shelf."
3,Strictly statistics for just two trade types.,"This book covers only statistical methods, and only for two types of pairs trades:Merger ""arbitrage"" and spread ""arbitrage"". It gives an overview of some of the statistical methods which have emerged in various scientific areas in the last 40 years, but no discussion of why they would apply to the stock/options/futures markets, where the visible laws of physics and biology have been massively confounded by the overlay of human behavior and world events.If you are wondering how to pick a short list of industries or sectors or stocks as candidates for pairs trading, (Before you start measuring correlation, etc.), don't look here.On the other hand, if you are skimming for nuggets, there might well be enough to excuse the price and the time."
3,good book,there is a scarcity of books in this category.. It is not the best comprehensive book on the topic but the presentation is very good and easy for a beginner to understand.
1,What??,"I am a professional trader and the math in this book not only put me to sleep, but left me wondering what I was reading about. While perfect for a graduate level mathematician, this book is not helpful for the real world..."
2,Interesting story needs better tellling,"The facts are worth learning about, but the story drags when it shouldn't."
5,lower cholesterol,This product really works to lower cholesterol. My doctor recommended it and I take it instead of prescription medications. This works.
4,TINY anvil,"Be aware that this is a very tiny anvil. I was surprised that it was so small even after getting a ruler to verify the dimensions given. After getting over the initial shock of its size it works well for smaller projects in my cold connections jewelry class and is very portable so my students can borrow it and use it at home. I may order one for myself to use in my studio as a spare. It has multiple sides to use as well, each side is flat and it has the options of curves to use too."
4,A very worth read if you are serious about current Astrobiological debate.,"This book is an essential read if you are a serious Astrobiologist. It provides valuable insight into one end of the spectrum within the most current debate on the origin and evolution of life. Although it represents the standpoint of the pessimist end of the debate in which complex and/or intelligent life is basically a supremely rare event in the Universe, it takes the reader through highly valuable yet as well highly arguable thought processes to arrive at the author's conclusion. An essential read if you want to be well informed on the most current Astrobiological debates. Ihrenes 2006."
5,Great book,"The author's arguments are well reasoned and based on sound scientific principles. Their arguments can be summarized as ""complex life is very fragile and the universe is very violent. Conditions must remain perfect over an extrodinarily long period of time for complex life to have the opportunity to form"" The authors simply examine the ""perfect"" conditions which have been in affect for us for 4 billion years and conclude that it is that very unlikly stability to which we owe our existence. The factors which provide for that stability are numerous and the probabilities of those factors all occuring simultaneously and remaining in affect for sufficiently lengthy periods of time can not be expected to be statistically common, but, indeed, very, very rare."
3,"... life, as we know, ...","I don't own and I haven't read the book but I agree with the authors that ""... while simple, microbial life will be very widespread in the universe, complex animal or plant life will be extremely rare.""I would just like to make a simple change in the sentence, adding "",as we know,"" after the second word ""life"", so that it would read:""...while simple, microbial life will be very widespread in the universe, complex animal or plant life, as we know, will be extremely rare.""Why isn't the History of Science a good lesson to scientists as to the fact that man's perception of reality is in continuous evolution? Why aren't we a little more humble and acknowledge our huge ignorance?"
2,Abundant microbial life can't evolve? Who says so?,"The authors conclude that microbial life is likely abundant in our galaxy and the Universe. Their arguments that this microbial life cannot evolve, are unconvincing. If life can develop, it can evolve. We do not know enough about other stars and their planets to conclude otherwise. Rest easy Science Fiction writers; the book misses its own most significant conclusion."
1,May have a hidden religious agenda - Intelligent Design or Creationism,"I read this book with great interest a few years ago. Now I have learned that there is lots of controversy over it. It seems that one of the scientists who was behind lots of the ideas in this book was a creationist who kept that fact quiet.There is another book ""Life Everywhere"" by David Darling, that answers many of the arguments in ""Rare Earth""To get both sides of the story, do a google search on:""rare earth"" ""intelligent design"" creationismYou might also add the name ""Guillermo Gonzalez"" to your search. He is the scientist/creationist who I mentioned earlier."
4,Broaden your horizen of the Universe !,"Ward and Brownly paint a superb picture of why life could be uncommon in the universe. A great fact-filled scientific book. If you have ever stared up at the nights sky, and thought their were neighbors in our universe, read this book and get a different view on things."
3,"Interesting information, in need of editing","This book contains a wealth of interesting information and I recommend it as a source to anyone interested in the subject. Unfortunately though, as several recent books, it seems to assume an attention span of about 15 minutes of its average reader, annoying me to the point of nearly throwing it away by repeating the same statements every few pages. A serious editor could have cut it down quite a bit without loss of information and even increased readability. The rating is an average of very good marks for contents and very bad marks for the presentation."
2,"Long, rambling, unfocused","Rare Earth is an overview of the complexities of, what we consider, life. Unfortunately, the book can easily be summarized in one sentence: life may be rare because Planet Earth may be rare. This simple statement may seem flippant, but the authors really offer no more conclusive information than this simple statement.The book does have some nice summaries of astrobiology, evolution, plate tectonics, snowball earth events, etc. If you are in the simple sciences (physics, astronomy, biology etc.), this book may provide a good read because there is a lot of theory but little real information. If you are looking for analysis and solid conclusions, this book will be a clear disappointment."
3,"history of earth is fine, but left out the present and future","I gave this book 3 stars because it did not continue to go anywhere. Apparently the authors haven't spent as much time studying and keeping up with the subject of Extraterrstrials/UFOs. There is a wealth of information on the subject as a whold and they seemed to ignore it. I have a hard time beleiving that we are the only ones in the universe. We don't know how much is out there, and probably never will. But the UFO question is real and cannot dismiss it with it's available history."
2,Astronomically Amazing Coincidences???,"I checked this out at my local library. Books like this really amaze me. Here are intelligent men who aptly demonstrate the unbelievable set of circumstances required for our home planet to be able to sustain life, and then they try to explain how all of this just happened to come into existence purely by mindless and random processes. What a coincidence; what a stroke of luck. Our world just amazingly came to be what it is without any creative force behind it. It truly is amazing that people are so willing to come up with theories that take much more faith to believe in than the idea that the earth is no accident."
5,Every woman should own this book!,"Although this book is directed at quilters, any person doing any type of repetitive activity can benefit from the wealth of sensible advice offered in this little gem of a book. The tone is friendly, not preachy. The advice sound, not off-the-wall or a struggle to implement. The book's information is wide in scope--covering everything from back, neck, and eye health to time management, healthy eating, and simple exercise--and its presentation is in an easy-to-follow format. My favorite piece of advice from Dr. Susan Delaney Mech is taking a 10 minute break every hour--it's good for your body and can make you 25% more productive. My advice is to get this book for yourself and for those you care about."
5,Rx for Quilters: Stitcher Friendly Advice for Every Body,"Susan writes this quilter-friendly book to help quilters everywhere. She reminds us about our posture, workspace, lighting, sewing chair, and MUCH MUCH more! This is not a large book but it is packed with great tips and advice. She reminds us to take frequent breaks.....now this might not be a great revelation but we need to be reminded to do this. I could recommend this book to quilters everywhere, in fact I have given it as a gift to friends. But this book is not just for quilters....anyone who is in a repetetive job should read the book......they would benefit from her expertise. Great book in with a friendly presentation. I felt that Susan was sitting with me and sharing her wealth of information!"
5,Practical advice for women's health,"I am not a quilter, yet I found Dr.Mech's book very helpful for a smarter way to deal with sitting down type tasks. Her advice is very practical and easily applied in our busy lifestyles at home or work. She talks about women at different ages and their different challenges to keeping healthy. It's a great book for anyone wanting to stay pain-free while enjoying repetitive tasks. Thank you, Dr. Mech!"
5,Super good!,"Buy this album! It is perfect for a road trip anywhere, but especially the coast of California. It takes you on its own little journey as the songs blend together seamlessly. You will want to play it over and over. It has a beautifully orchestrated mix of acoustic guitars, beats, weird percussion, tasty bass lines and male and female vocals that you don't have to know spanish to appreciate. There 2nd album is real good too!"
1,NEVER RECEIVED,"ORDERED IN SEPTEMBER AND NEVER RECEIVED THIS ITEM. KEPT GETTING TOLD IT WAS COMING BUT SHIP DATE KEPT BEING PUSHED FURTHER AND FURTHER BACK. I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY AN ITEM IS ADVERTISED OR OFFERED BUT CANNOT BE DELIVERED AND THE CUSTOMER IS EXPECTED TO HANG IN LIMBO FOREVER UNTIL THEY ARE TOLD ... OOPS! SORRY, ORDER CANNOT BE FILLED. REGARDS, P"
2,Shows its age,"This was probably a good movie when it was first released, but it definitely shows its age."
3,India under British rule,"Enjoyable but very dated, a good insight into British Colonial reign in India during the pre war days and the feeling felt by ivarious tribes."
5,Gunga Din revisited,"Although made in 1939 in California, many cinema goers thought the film was made on location in India. George Stevens, the director was a master of his time.After seeing the film, listen to the excellent comentary about the making of the film. The three stars are almost outshone by Sam Jaffee who plays Gunga Din, and he plays it wonderfully.This is another example of the quality of hits Hollywood produced in 1939, the golden year in American Cinema."
5,Gunga Din Outstanding!,"This review is for the movie not the DVD. This is an outstanding movie with great performances by Cary Grant, Victor McLaughlin and Sam Jaffe as Gunga Din. It's the story of a Indian serving as a stable hand with the British Army in India who dreams about becoming a bugler with the Army. Plenty of action sequences and humor. Very well written and some of the best acting for movies of this genre. The bad guys are truly evil and the good guys always get their revenge. A true classic!"
1,Gunga Din (colorised VHS),"I ordered this colorised version of ""GUNGA DIN"" in VHS,hoping to see the legendary film for the first time in color ,but what a disappointment!The colors are almost monochromatical yellow from the start to the end (particularly the night scenes), making the movie unwachable,at least for those who have seen the film in its original black and white version."
5,An acclaimed classic!,"This is one of these unforgettable movies that almost does not need any presentation. A lot of thrills, laughs, action and adventure make of this picture an obligated reference at the moment to make the recount of the great adventure films ever made."
5,Most Heroes Are Never Heard From,"I can say nothing to truly describe this classic movie that has not already been said. Even in the horrors of war, a sense of humor has to be in place. Gary Grant, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., and Victor McLaglen were superb in their roles, of course. Sam Jaffe's role as Gunga Din was a small almost insignificant part portraying a want-a-be soldier, who could not seam to hold his own wits. However, when the need arose, Din proved his worth as good or better than the best. I'm glad I got the DVD so that I could take the time to see it again and again."
5,All-time favorite!,"For 50-ishes, it's a great movie. Black & white take you back to memory lane. The story may not be as great. Gunga Din appeared almost mid-way of the story but his smile will melt you away!"
4,Wonderful way to interact with your baby!,"I ordered both books availible on this topic and found this one to be far more practical and user friendly. The illustrations and discriptions of different techniques are easy for those inexperienced at yoga to follow. I found the sequence on relieving colic to be especially useful for me and my little one. My baby loves our ""Yoga time"" during the day!"
4,Casino Royale Scores!,"After the rather inferior Die Another Day, the Bond producers went back to basics, and came back out with a royal flush. Daniel Craig is a way better Bond actor than Brosnan ever was. Rougher, tougher, and edgier in every way! Eva Green is the best ""good"" Bond girl I've seen since Michelle Yeoh in Tomorrow Never Dies. There is real chemistry between her and Craig! Mads Mikkelson makes for the scariest Bond baddie in recent years. His torture methods on 007 is even enough to make Auric Goldfinger cringe! Dynamite action sequences bring back some good old-fashioned stuntwork instead of cheesy visual effects. My only complaints are a sometimes slow going final third act and I wished they had more of a car chase with the new Aston Martin. Still, it was fun to see Bond get his first tux, explain the entire recipe of his preferred drink to the casino waiter, and best of all, get his Walther PPK back after a 2 1/2 Bond movie series hiatus. Bond is back on track!"
2,A low point in the James Bond Series,"There are a couple of good elements in this movie: Daniel Craig is very close to Ian Fleming's original character (a bit reminiscent of the very good Timothy Dalton on that count) and two action scenes (in Africa and Venice) are simply stunning. But the script is plain silly and the second James Bond girl is ugly and utterly unconvincing in her role. Also the script voluntarily demolishes quite a few established pillars of the James Bond franchise, meaning that in the end this movie is not really a ""James Bond movie"" in my view. Put simply, I strongly recommend avoiding this movie if you are a James Bond fan. If you are not and if you like skinny brunettes with a fox-like face, you might like it."
1,Doesn't work in my Samsung DVD player,This DVD won't play properly in my Samsung HD-841 DVD player. It freezes up at several points. I would avoid buying it until they fix the problem.
2,"The movie is good, but the DVD isn't worth a damn","I would probably give it 4 stars just based on the movie alone, but the dvd sucks.It is nothing like the old MGM Bond dvd's, there are no commentaries, you pop the disc in and it starts playing...commercials...who made this, Disney? I don't want to sit through ten minutes of commercials, I hate that above all else. I know you can FF through them, but that's not the point. It ruins the feel that the old dvd's had. Why didn't they let the disc start up with the old ""Activate"" screen like the other Bond dvd's did? It all looked so Bondish, the activate screen and then the menus, playing Bond music in the background and scenes from the movies. Here we get commercials with CR, it sux, and yes, it IS that big a deal to me. I love my Bond movies."
1,Thanks again Sony,"I didn't see this in the theater and I couldnt wait for it to hit DVD so I could watch it at home. Once again, Sony has changed something and rendered the movie useless. If you have a high end DVD player, you may not be able to play Disc one. We have a Denon and a Mitsubishi and the disc will not play on them. Plays great on our $80 portable with 7"" screen though! :P"
3,Bland Bond,"I've been a big 007 fan since the first ones in the 60's. Sean Connery, Roger Moore, etc, set the standard for the character. Even though this film was one the good ones the new Bond (Daniel Criag) just looks like he should be the super spy Bond would fight, he really looks too German, like one of the kids from Hiltler's specially breeding programs. The guys looks spoiled the whole movie for me, how can you accept him as Bond when he's unacceptable as English."
4,Shaken not Broken,"Great Movie! Back to status of Dr No and From Russia with Love. No farfetched gagets and corny one liners. More Realistic, if you could call it that. Bring back a Male ""M""! Then it would be Excellent."
3,Can't Get Pass The Look Of The New Bond,"This movie does have alot of action, but what about the character, James Bond? In past James Bond movies, he was always cool, handsome, smart, sexy, and tough. I found Daniel Craig lacking in some of the qualifications. Apparently, they wanted a new look and edge to James Bond, but I feel they should have stuck to the look of the character. There had to have been other actors to choose from. James Bond as a blonde, come on. They must have thought about how some of the fans would take to the new look of Bond. I am still a fan of Bond movies, but maybe someday, the old James Bond look will come back."
5,Casino Royale,This movies makes we wonder why we waited so long for a real James Bond all these years.
5,Casino Royale - Good Bond flick,"This movie is one of the best of the Bond series and rivals any of the action with a brain movies in recent years. I liked that he was sneakier and gave M a lot of trouble. Too bad he killed off (indirectly) all the good looking women, and wrecked the Aston Matin before he got to drive it much.There were seemingly fewer times that challenged my level of suspension of disbelief than in previous Bond flicks. Perhaps the stunt men are getting better, or the CG is more seamless?I enjoyed the blu-ray features regarding the stunts, etc.I am still really upset about that Aston Martin...Cheers"
2,Someone please rescue me from this!!,"After 2 attempts to watch this installment of the new James Bond movie, I had to shut it off. 45 minutes into the film and I still don't know the plot. I was unable to figure out if Bond was on a new mission and if he was, what was it? Who are the villains and what did they do? Very poor plot and character development. Granted, the first chase scene between Bond and whoever that guy with the knapsack was, did hold my attention. The standard Bond scene at the card table was horrible and the seduction of the bad guys wife was laughable. This guy couldn't shine Sean Connery's shoes. Pierce Brosnan was better.My 2 stars for this film is based on the action stunts."
1,arggggggggg,"The WORST ever of the series.Everything is not Bond as Ian wished him to be, as well as the screenplay."
1,Worst Bond movie ever,"This is the Worst Bond movie ever. Bond just received his license to kill, which means he is in his early career year. But the storyline is after 911. Which means this movie's timeline does not match with other Bonds movies.Worst of all, all his moves are predictable.Don't buy the movie. Rent one and you will be tired of it after one watch."
1,Insults your intelligence,"Horrible movie-don't waste your money.Bond chases the guy through a construction site with everyone watching but when they are running through the site at the end noone notices them.Seems like someone who have called the cops with all of the shooting and ruckus going on.Of course they jump from obstacle to obstacle which would have killed the normal person.Then after Bond is surronded by an army of men with guns he somehow is able to escape.It's like the script was written by a 5th grader.""Let's have all kind of cool stuff that doesn't make sense.""If you are a true bond fan of the James Bond classics then this movies will disappoint-big time."
1,Warning!,"The Blu-ray version does not have subtitles, unlike the DVD version which does. A lot of the charm is in the dialog, which can be unintelligble. I give the DVD version 5 stars."
1,Buyer beware,"Somewhere, for some reason, someone at Sony thought it would be a great idea to add some sort of new copy protection to some of their DVDs. Unfortunately, in doing so, these DVDs will NOT play on many older models of DVD player. I have an older Toshiba player which does not recognize this DVD. Sony's solution of ""just buy a new player"" is completely unacceptable.I've heard the movie is very well done, but it does not appear I'll be seeing it any time soon.(1 Star for Sony's idiocy, not for the movie.)"
2,Sooooo disappointed...so NOT James Bond!,"No longer suave, no longer sophisticated.Would have been a good movie if it hadn't been labelled as Bond"
5,Craig as Bond is Second Only to Connery,"I think this is probably one of my favorite Bond movies ever. I'm not sure I'd say that Daniel Craig is quite as good as Sean Connery as far as Bonds go, but the plot and lack of cheesiness of Casino Royale were a welcome improvement over recent Bond movies."
4,One of the best Bond Films,The chase scene in the beginning is amazing. The plot twists keep you interested all the way through.
5,"Great movie, great Blu Ray disk","You need more? This movie looks so good in HiDef that I believe it was as good or better than the movie theatre image. Plus, the comforts of home! It's getting to be a better (and cheaper) experience than going to the movies."
4,Good movie,"I saw this in the theatre first based on word of mouth. I agree with those reviews that this is a refreshing take on the 007 lineage. The opening chase scene is, I think, as exciting as my favorite 007 opening action scene, from 'Golden Eye', where Pierce Brosnan chases a plane off a precipice. The rest of 'Casino' is surprisingly well written and acted. While not perfect I would recommend 'Casino' to anyone interested in a well made action thriller"
4,Wow!,"At 4.5/5 stars, Casino Royale was a thrilling and enjoyable film for me. While I am disappointed that Pierce Brosnan is no longer 007, the plotline in this film more than made up for it, and Daniel Craig does a nice job as James Bond, though his light hair did throw me off, for me, James Bond just HAS to have dark hair. But honestly, that's just a minor quibble in what has proven to be a rather entertaining and enjoyable film. There's just enough twists and turns in this film to make it entertaining, and Bond slipping up and the conflict that follows... let's just say that the actress who plays M also did a wonderful job in her role, the only person who could have rivaled her was Merryl Streep. The gambling scenes were also a lot of fun to watch. Kudos on an entertaining James Bond film!"
2,Jame Bond 003.5,"Being a huge Bond fan, I highly anticipated watching Casino Royale and I'm sad to say, I was completely disappointed. The storyline was very fractured, Daniel Craig was not believeable as Bond and at the end of the movie I found myself sayin ""huh?"" I understand Casion Royale is the first Bond book and this movie introduces Bond to the world and Bond is learning his way, still I don't think the story was told very well. While there are a couple of exciting chase scenes, I think the time spent on the chase scenes may have taken away from Bond's character development. Even at 2 hours 22 minutes, the story felt half-told.Eventhough I am disappointed with Casino Royale, if you are a Bond fan, it is a ""must-have"" for your collection. Maybe it will be one of those movies that grows on me after I have seen it a couple of times, I hope so."
5,Hands down best Bond ever!!,"I fully agree with and cannot improve upon Mr. Waldo Martin's review of the movie. If you've ever read any of Fleming's Bond books, then you already know Daniel Craig fits the character as he is supposed to be better than ANY of the previous actors. Gone is the tiresome womanizing, adolescent humor, and the ridiculous contrivances. Good riddance!!I can't wait for the next one ... too bad we have to wait until 008!!"
5,Fabulous,"A absolute gem of a film! Simply put....it's just brilliant. It is the best 007 film since ""Octopussy"" in 1983 and arguably the best ever. Daniel Craig is clearly the best Bond since Sean Connery and silenced all detractors with a commanding and decisive performance. A must have for any 007 enthusiast or anyone else who can appreciate a fine film."
5,Best Bond Yet,"This is one of the best James Bond films yet! To clear up, this film was a restart of the series, much like ""Batman Begins"", it IS NOT a prequel. I enjoyed this film a lot, but hope the next one goes back to some of the traditions from the other 20+ bond films. But this is still a great restart of the series; and Daniel Craig is the best bond!"
5,Class meets Grit.,"Daniel Craig delivers a gritty performance that redefines the bond franchise for todays audience. Where the Bond's of past got out of jams with gadgets and bravado, Craig wills his way through chases, fights, and villains all the while keeping you emotionally invested. Eva Green excels in her role as a female counterpart to James. Worth getting on BD at around $20."
4,The Pursuit of Happyness,"""The Pursuit of Happyness"" is one of the best movies of 2006. Will Smith delivers his most powerful performance yet with his real son playing the part of his son in the movie. It is the story of a man whose wife leaves him with their son and quickly he is going bankrupt. His son and him live in shelter homes, bathrooms, and on the streets while Will Smith's character tries to get their life back at a stock broker firm. This would be a definite 5 star movie except for a bit of a language problem. His son says the f-word (but in a somewhat comical way) and Will Smith uses his share of bad words while a taxi cab man repeatedly calls him an a--hole. This is a powerful and fun movie (if a llliiitttllleee slow at times) that show the best of Will Smith's acting career in the last ten minutes."
3,Blah,"Worst bond ever. Original so much more interesting. Why bother.........Blah blahBtw why is there aminimum number of words to write a review, dumb."
5,Best Bond I've Seen,"I've seen it about 5 times now (2 in theaters, 3 at home) and I still get into it. The quality of this film on Blu-ray is spectacular and I'm continually impressed. I'd suggest that everyone watch it at least once, even if you're not a fan of the 007 series"
4,Good news Bond is Back,"Excellent action, terse dialogue will hopefully launch a new 007. Mr Craig gives his role a definite grit. He is beliveable as a ruthless opponent whom gets his heart broken and is seared by that experience.Looking foward to seeing more of him."
5,Best Bond Ever...,"Its got everthing: intrigue, suspense, great special effects, good acting, excellent cast, and proper character development for a 2 hour movie. Excellent!"
5,Casino Royale... superb,"I love the new portrayal of James Bond. Not all the flashy tech, not over-doing the womanizing, just a kickass guy who knows his stuff and isn't afraid to get his hands dirty. Much more realistic than previous versions, he actually gets beat up! Just love the plot line, which is something hollywood doesn't deliver as often as they used to."
1,New Bond is Crap,"The new Bond stinks. My first issue, we have a bond before he was a 007, yet he's in 2006 with a modern Aston Martin, modern Omega, and todays cash? M was taken over by Judy Dench with the coming of Brosnan, yet all of a sudden we just stuck her in a pre-Connery role? This makes no sense.There is no Q, no gadgets, no Money Penny, no whit, no sexual inneuendos, and terrible acting. All this guys got is either sad puppy dog eyes or a blank stare that is supposed to be intimidating. Half of the movie is either watching him run or watching him play cards, neither of which is very appealing or interesting. I didn't get to know his girl either, which makes it hard to care about her. I'm truly sad to see the death of all that is Bond."
5,New Bond on BlueRay is a must have!!!,"I saw this movie last year when it came out. First I had my reservations on a new Bond movie since they've been using the same cookie cutter formula from the beginning. But when I saw it in the theater, right from the very first scene, I realized it wasn't the same old Bond. Daniel Craig to me is the best Bond since Sean Connery but without those who carried the Bond over the years would never leave us with this masterpiece. I can't wait to get my copy."
2,"Should be called ""One of the Worst Bonds ever""","I have to say that I was totally disappointed with this movie. I have been a James Bond fan since they first came out and even though they are a bit on the hard to believe side they were entertaining. I found this James Bond movie to be very dry and slow. I had a hard time sitting and watching the whole thing. It had a couple of scenes that showed promise (which is why the two stars) but once you enjoyed them you were returned to a hum-drum movie. I would have felt over charged to have payed $5.00 for this movie, let alone what they are charging. My advice is save your money and if you don't have all the old Bonds get one of them instead."
3,I want the old Bond back.,"This movie is perferct for someone who likes poker and action. However, Daniel Craig is totally different from all previous James Bonds. That is exactly what I did not like about this movie. For example, when the bar tender asks him if he wants the martini shaken or stirred he just says ""Do I look like I give a damn"". He is definately not the traditional English gentlemen but a modern action hero."
4,Worth It!,"I was never a big fan of 007 movies. The last one I saw was with Roger Moore and I don't remember the title. I took a chance on this one because some friends said it was good.I really liked Casino Royale. Lots of good action. There were 3 times I thought the movie was over as if everything got taken care of by Bond then all of a sudden, there's another twist. The entire movie kept me interested and I'm glad I bought it."
5,The only problem with this movie is that I haven't bought it on BluRay,"Daniel Craig as Bond brings a hard headed cynical sophistication back to the character. No gadgets or double entendre's, just pure badassery."
4,A new and improved kind of James Bond,"Daniel Craig delivers surprisingly good interpretation on James Bond. He is not afraid to create his own brand of Agent 007. You will not see him impersonate any of the previous takes on the famous spy. I like his looks. He is well built bur not pretty; he is handsome in the acquired taste kind of way. He cares not if his martini is shaken or stirred and we see him vulnerable both physically and emotionally for the first time. Fighting and running scenes in the movie are frighteningly fast and scary while love scenes more passionate than any of the other Bond movies before. One part of the film is supposedly set in Montenegro, but I am still confused if the scenes were actually shot in Montenegro, Czech Republic or Italy. International group of actors brings the right kind of chemistry into this film. Nothing too heavy and yet, very entertaining."
3,Where is Pierce Brosnan,"I got this on Blu-ray because i thought the video quality of the standard DVD was horrible. The older James Bond movies on the Ultimate Edition version has video that was almost HD in quality.The Blu-ray is definitely an upgrade for the picture quality, but is by no far as good as other blu-ray or HD-dvd's out there.The movie was ""ok"". I dont like what they have done with the franchise, but i will still watch the new bond movies. I still like the Pierce Brosnan Bond movies over Casiono Royale.Casino Royale only had 2 good sequences. The one in Africa and the other at the airport. The rest is watching them play cards in the casino.Anyway... its entertaining."
4,No a Cartoon but a good thriller,"Casino gets back to the original roots of a Bond with a nearly psychotic rage who kills without compunction. It also explains more of how he becomes the detached spy and shuns real personal ties. The stunts are traditional stuntmen based ones, not computer graphic generated ones so it adds to the realism. There are enough cartoonish movies so it's good to see a real old fashioned thriller."
3,Not quite James Bond,"As an adventure movie it is great but as a James Bond movie it just does not make it. James Bond was supposed to be a suave sophisticated upper class spy. Daniel Craig comes across as a yobbo just off the fish cart and jammed into a suit.Sure he looks pretty and there is all the car scenes and the shoot them up, beat them up bits, but he just does not fit the image regardless of the hair colour. And what happened with the card game scene, firstly we have draw poker instead of chemin de fer, a traditional casino card game similar to Blackjack and then in the middle of the game the continuity gets messed up. Were we considered too stupid to understand chemin de fer ?I had high hopes for this film, so much for that."
3,A Chick-Flick in Disguise,I am an old die-hard Bond fan and still prefer Sean Connery out of all the Bonds. I know some of the gadgets and gimmicks are goofy but Bond ain't supposed to cry. Anyway I bought this for my wife who loves it!! I'll take Goldfinger or Diamonds are Forever anyday! There were some awesome stunts in this movie and it was refreshing to know I could get most of the gadgets at Best Buy.
1,Worst 007 Movie Ever,This was the worst Bond movie we have ever watched. My husband loves 007 movies; he almost fell asleep. I was so bored I felt physically ill and left the room. Boring...
1,Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money!!,Don't even waste your time!! I love the other bond movies but this is terrible..so boring and drawn out!!
3,The Sum of all Fears of the Bond franchise,"No, this movie is not as bad as the stinker in the title. It is similar as it does have serious continuity problems. First of all this is a prequel, and set in 2006??? Secondly, Judi Dench's M is in charge and Bond got his 00 status at the beginning of the movie??????? Absolutely no sense to this.The other problem is that this Bond is not a good guy. He is a thug, no better then the criminals in this movie.So why three stars instead of the zero stars it should probably get? Because if you forget this is a Bond movie, it is fairly enjoyable. Even though this movie falls flat, I am glad they tried something new, the Bond formula is beyond tired. Hopefully next time they can find a reasonable storyline and a good Bond."
1,Awful,"A truly awful movie. Bond movies succeed when they have an elegant hero, with an understandable plot. This movie requires an understanding of stock market puts, which is hardly common knowledge. The heroine commits suicide for no apparent reason; granted, often the Bond girl dies, but usually by murder, not by suicide. Mindless, extend violence scenes."
3,Casino Royale,"I've mainly written this review to warn those who purchase this item from Amazon instead of one of the independent sellers. I bought this Blu ray from Amazon and when it arrived, the Blu Ray box was not in good shape. The plastic had that cheap wavy quality to it. I'm sure that all of their copies aren't like this one but I'm just warning you. Other than that, the disc was fine and it looks great. But if you are a stickler like me, it might be best to not take the chance and buy it from someone else!"
1,"George Lazenby, where are you?","Like watching a video game- no humor or memorable music, lots of violence and sadism. More beefcake than romance. Sylvester Stallone could have been as good a James Bond."
5,a great dvd!,We really love this movie and this 3 disc set was great. Lots of special features included and the package was beautiful.
4,Action,"Good action, story seems fragmented. Interesting, leaves one to wait for the next scene and the next sequel. The video quality is very good from Amazons' streaming."
3,Just ok.,"This movie was entertaining and not terrible, but it lacked suspense and seemed to drag on more than other James Bond movies."
2,"kind of boring, very forgettable movie",Not doing much of a review but this movie seemed to drag on and is kind of forgettable.It had a few good scenes but for the most part was predictable and didn't leave much of an impression.
3,Great Movie (the sound was terrible),"The only complaint I have about this rental was the volume of the movie. I had my TV on 90 of 100, Sony Bravia television broadcasting through my PS3 and we could barely hear some of the dialog. The film seemed well made and had a great plot, but I feel like we missed some parts because it was so soft."
4,"Great,but too short.","I loved Daniel Craig as Bond. I was a little skeptical at first when I heard he was going to play Bond, but he really pulled it off. The story could have been better. It missed a little more of that secret agent feel. At the end of the movie I just wanted more. The over all Bond image is preserved. I cant wait for the next one. A must own for any true Bond fan."
3,not sure,"I thought daniel craig wasn't charming enough to be bond, there was somthing about him that didn't fit right.Also there were way too many ford cars in the movie. I suspect they were payed alot from the ford motor company."
2,Just OK,"This movie is somewhat entertaining, but sporatic in it's storyline and pretty bland in the romance department. And what's all the hullabaloo about Daniel Craig's nude scene? There IS NONE. Even the sex scenes are totally G rated. Pretty dull."
3,Daniel Craig's great/Script writers stink,"How can a script Writer destroy the end of a Bond movie destined to be a classic??? Daniel Craig is fantastic! His work is worthy of the Bond Ian Flemming invisioned. A movie well worth seeing, till the end. Bond never, ever would let a woman take his mind off the job at hand.Period. Lionheart."
3,"ok, kind of slow","didn't seem to have that james bond feel, wasn't bad just wasn't great, movie got a little slow and the action died down about half way through the movie."
2,this isnt a Bond movie!,"First let me say i really like the new bond,I've always liked Craig,he does nothing to hurt this movie,but man what happend there has never been a bond movie I didnt like untill now,theres a good chase seen near the begining but after that its off to a poker tournament for 45min. or more..I dont understand the lack of action and the lack of any gadgets.Ok some might defend this and say well this is a new type of bond movie...I say B.S.When we watch a bond movie we like action,some hot bond girls,some gadgets and a save the world theme..With this movie you get none of that,zero.I dont understand all the great reviews,in a nutshell its really boring!"
4,"Great movie, but...","i loved the movie. i felt that the Bond series was a joke before this movie. I know that kitsch was written into the scrupts on purpose and most of the bond movies are from a different era but i couldn't consider them action movies. Casino Royale feels like an action movie. My only problem is that there wasn't a digital copy. i guess i assumed that the : Cillectors Edition"" wold contain one. Kind of a gyp but Ik guess thats my fault."
5,best ever?,"The latest Bond incarnation may be the best. Daniel Craig brings a whole new energy to the character. This Bond is serious, dangerous, and sexy."
4,Bond in the post-Austin Powers era,"I guess for some die-hard 007 fans, it just isn't Bond if it doesn't have gadgets and gorgeous babes, along with a Dr. Evil-esque adversary. This Bond is not the same campy, martini-swilling, uber-suave hipster he has been in previous Bond films. I love this new James Bond. (This in spite of being disappointed that Pierce Brosnan wouldn't be returning.)The opening chase sequence was breathtaking. I was struck with how much more athletic the new Bond is. Making him more fallable and vulnerable makes his exploits seem that much more impressive."
1,"Dragged. No funnies, no girls, no gadgets, not the bond I grew up with.","What made Bond great was it was funny, great gadgets, easy storyline, bond girls, a family film.Now its volient, no gadgets, no girls and not a family film. Even though the previous Bonds weren't Ian Flemming's idea of Bond ... he previous ingreidants made Bond famous. Sean Connery got the best mix.This was an awful film that just dragged and relied on visual effects. I still don't undstand the realtionship with Vespa.Bring back the bond of Connery!"
2,very slack 007 movie.,"This movie sucked overall, it never seemed to get going, big on drama, poor first film for the new 007. I was ready for it to end. Rent it only. do not buy."
5,Possibly the Best Bond and Bond Film Yet,"Having seen all the Bond films I have to say Casino Royale is quite possibly the best Bond movie to date. I'd have to watch it a few more times to really decide where it falls but it is undoubtedly in the top 3.Also, Daniel Craig's portrayal of Bond is quite possibly better than Connery's. Craig's Bond is certainly 2nd best if not the best. I'll hold on decision until Bond 22 comes out November 7th, 2008 (hopefully)."
1,IT wasnt what i expected,I thought i was purchasing an actual dvd.. was purchasing as a gift. i was very disappointed. I also tried to cancel there was no where ( even where it stated ) to cancel purchase
3,"more Die Hard than James Bond, but still a enjoyable action flick","This was an enjoyable movie, not great but good. It's really far closer to the Die Hard movies than the James Bond movies. I didn't think much of the person playing M though."
3,Not Bad,Not a bad movie but wasn't what I expected for a james bond movie but I do give it a high rating tho. I would consider thios movie to be Mediocre but it is watchable tho so enojy it with a friend.
1,Awful,The review said widescreen and it was fullscreen also it never mentioned it had a French version too. Very upset.
1,Beyond Awful,"No plot. Movie went on, and on, and on, we kept hoping it would end.Really America? Is this what entertains us? Feel as though we wasted an evening.Wasn't aware of the torture scene. Seems like a PG-13 rating was not strong enough."
3,It's not bad,I prefer Brosnan playing Bond. I think he's a much better actor than Craig. This movie is decent with lots of action and running. Not as good as the other Bond movies but you won't fall to sleep with this.
2,worst of bond,"this is the only bond movie I have not watched twicethere is no style and where did they find the so calledleading lady,she has no appeal at all,the supportingladies were much more attractive"
2,unconvincing bond,"Altho there are some good action scenes in Casino Royale, and Daniel Craig is an excellent actor with an interesting face, he does not convince (this viewer at least) as Bond. In fact he behaves more like a Jimmy Bones than a James Bond. This is largely due to the silly 'soft centre' of the plot, Bond's love for Vesper Lynd. Eva Green, who plays the character, often looks beautiful but lacks appeal, sexual or otherwise, and their exchanges are mechanical, totally lacking in the kind of chemistry that should exist between two people attracted to each other, or who are antagonistic.The best Bonds are still Sean Connery and Pierce Brosnan.I was a little surprised when the dvd began with previews, which is to say, ads, of other movies before going into the main feature. Wish it didn't."
3,Mindless action covers over a good plot/story.,Too much violence in a movie with good actors and a working plot.
1,unfortunately a technical glitch,"The one star is not for the movie. I think it's the best ""Bond"" of them all, and Daniel Craig is amazingly good. No, the one star is for the technical aspects of the disc itself. The studios are apparently using a new form of encryption that will not work on older DVD players (mine is only 3 years old, too!). I tried two different discs, thinking the first must have been corrupted, but the same problem.I understand the need for encryption, but please don't lock out those of us with ""older"" machines."
2,Not a huge fan of this Bond here's why -,"Bond was always a classy cat with a lot of interesting spy weapons and gadgets. This is more like another action film and this Bond is to rough. Not bad, but just another action movie."
1,So Disappointed...,"Worst 007 ever. I love Daniel Craig, but this movie was boring, drug on and it was predictable. So sad."
1,"Product was used -- it had been opened before. The quality of the disc was fine, so I'll keep it, but it was listed as new, and","was DEFINITELY not new. It doesn't even look like it is in its original blu-ray case, and looks like a knock-off case. The disc itself looks legit, but I'm not certain if it's an original or a copy."
4,Better than I expected,"After so many Bond movies, I didn't watch this Casino Royale with high hope! But man, the action somewhat blew me away!! Great action flick, Daniel Craig may not be the best looking Bond, but he's definitely the Bond with the hottest bod! The Bond girl, I originally thought she's not that pretty when I saw the preview/trailer, but man, after watching the DVD, I think she's gorgeous and elegant, wish they can keep the Bond girls longer than just 1 movie!"
4,The new James Bond,"I am still a Sean Connery fan as James Bond, but Daniel Craig put a new spin on Bond, and I really enjoyed the movie."
4,The real James Bond is back !,"Casino Royale is a return to the essence of James Bond : less gadgets and science fiction but much more action, plot, feelings, intensity, darkness. Daniel Craig may have his pros and cons but totally fits in the ""new look James Bond"".Eva Green is full of charm and her role far more complex than the usual decorative baby doll.A real moment of pleasure and entertainment !"
5,Great Movie,This is just an all around great action packed movie that has a little bit of everything in it for the whole family but this is a definitely a must see movie
4,Where are the Special Features,"It's the second best Bond movie released so far. But When I get a second disk of special features, I expect more than three. Movie = 5 stars, Special Features = 2.5 stars."
5,Great Experience,The Blu-Ray move came just as expected. It was in Pristine condition and was just how they decribe the movie would be.
5,Best Bond film in the last 20 years,"This film is great. It changes up the formula quite a bit and reminds me a lot of all the things I liked about ""In her Magesty's Secret Service"" and none of the things I didn't like.The film is long, to be sure, especially for an action flick and some of the supporting characters aren't very interesting. However the depth they go to examine the main character makes up for this.I hope to see Daniel Craig do another one. He definitely did this one justice."
2,What is this?,"This is not James Bond. I don't know what it is. All I see is a lot of action sequences and no plot. If this is the end result of Sony Pictures buying MGM and thus getting their hands on the James Bond Franchise, Then it is resulting in nothing less then garbage."
3,MST3K Fans Rejoice -- Rifftrax Is Here!,"A spine-tingling thrill ride that moves from the exotic poker tables of Montenegro, to the exotic hotel rooms of Montenegro, then back to the poker tables, then the rooms again, then a return visit to the poker table for a more extended stay, then a short rest and back to the poker table! And there's killing, too! And lot's of sweet lovin', if you're into that.Daniel Craig inhabits the role of James Bond, the dashing MI6 agent who holds a license to kill, as well a license to wax his chest and wear tiny, undignified swimming trunks. Eva Green is Vesper Lynd, (get it?) the hot-to-trot financier who administers the majority of Bond's lovin', with luscious Caterina Murino batting clean-up. And Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen stars as Le Chiffre, a sardine-faced villain and numbers genius (he can make change for a dollar without punching it into the cash register!)Joining Mike is Kevin Murphy. Both Mike and Kevin have a license to Riff."
4,"Good, almost great","I heard a lot of good things about this movie. Many said it was the best yet. I think it comes close, but not quite. It starts off on fire, very fast, lots of action. Then it hit these lulls through out where it drags on a little. Some of it was believable, some totally unbelievable. It was probably about 20 minutes too long, but the story held with some interesting twists. Definitely worth getting."
3,It was Bond but it wasn't,"The movie lay out was not in the tradition of the other Bond films. For one there are trailers to other movies at the first of this one, the other DVD's don't have those and there is no 007 shooting at the gun barrel at the first like the other Bond films. There other differences I won't get into. I like David Craig. He has more muscle tone than the other Bonds, women will really notice that. This Bond really like drinking. He nearly always has a bourbon or martini glass in his hand. I know the other Bonds drank but you really notice it with this Bond. I didn't like the Bond women. Sort of homely and ugly to me. A lot, I mean lot of action but it was too chaotic for my liking. Camera moved to much it the action scenes. ""Q"" was nowhere to be found but ""M"" was sure around. I like the other Bonds better."
3,Who wants thai subtitles?,"I've liked this new James Bond, I've been seeing them since Dr. No with Sean Connery and Ursula Andress. Although the final scene with the vilain is unworthy of a hero, (the manhood of Mr. Bond is clearly jeopardized) and the Venice sequence is somewhat confusing, this is one very good 007. I've downgraded my evaluation because of the absence of subtitles in a 25 gig media."
5,What a wonderful movie,"I'M A FULL TIME JAMES BOND FAN, AND .....WHAT A WONDERFUL MOVIE......THE BEST WAY TO SHOW THE BEGINING OF BOND....AND WHAT TO SAY ABOUT DANIEL CRAIG....EXCELLENT ACTOR"
2,Where's the action?,I gave this movie 2 stars for the first 10 minutes of this movie-it was in true James Bond style-great action on the edge of your seat! Then it took a severe nosedive. It was more of a romance story than a action-adventure movie. The card playing was dragged out and boring(I enjoy watching Bravo's Celebrity Poker more!) The only action was just watching Bond run around....alot. The car chasing just involved James Bond following another car down a road for about a minute with no fancy car moves and action. I didn't care if any of the characters lived or died including Bond!
1,Terrible Bond film,"No super bad guy, no Q, No awesome new spy tech, and no single line quips. Only way to watch this movie is to watch it with the rifftrax crew. The movie is very funny then. lol.Plus Daniel Craig is a anti gun wuss."
1,IT SUCKED,"Not a bond fan, and this was one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time...it lacked action, it lacked script, it lacked EVERYTHING!"
4,Double Dipping Bond,"I've been a 007 fan ever since DR. NO premiered as the bottom half of a double drive-in bill in Kansas City. I loved Connery; thought Lazenby's OHMSS the best of the Bond bunch; suffered through the Moore era; loathedDalton's petrified agent; tolerated Brosnan's glossy but empty 007 - and woke up during the last two minutes of CASINO ROYALE to hail Daniel Craig as THE new Bond on the block. Naturally I snatched up the original DVDrelease.So now here comes Sony with a new ""collector's edition"" (double-dipping, as they do so well). There actually are some snippets that make this one worth having, notably the ""deleted"" which actually do add a little more to the film. The extras are puff-pieces - but watchable.Only for Bond die-hards, or folks who believe Blue Ray will replace regular DVD."
5,movie lover,"I've never been a james bond fan but my husband is. I bought him this because it was the only one he didn't have. He usually watches them when I'm not around. I watched this one with him & I was pleasantly surprised. I liked it. It actually had a love story to it with a tragic ending, who knew. I would recommend it to even people who were'nt fans before this to give it a try, you'll be surprised too!"
4,Bond's First Mission!!!,"Forget the last 1,367 Bond movies, this one reinvents the character. When I first saw this, I was confused as to what it was, but later, I realized they were starting over. Bond enters a high-stakes poker tournament at Casino Royale in Montenegro. Le Chiffre, the bad guy tries to win, but Bond must beat him. With the help of Vesper Lynd, Bond must stop the bad guy. If you love action films and James Bond, you'll love CASINO ROYALE!!!!"
5,The 007 team rides again.,Daniel and M are at it again and perfect as usual. One of the best Bonds since George Lazenby. Amazon always comes through.
5,AWESOME MOVIE!!!,"I don't want to give away anything about this movie, so I'll try to keep it short and sweet. Definately a must see. Definately a must see twice, no perhaps 3 times. I LOVE this movie. Now I am an action packed movie lover, and this movie was just right for me. And, my goodness, was Daniel Craig an fabulous actor, The best James Bond actor to me. I would highly suggest you purchase this movie. It is worth every dime you'll pay. Trust me. I promise, you will fall in love with this movie....and quite possibly, Daniel Craig...just like I did."
4,Most Believable Bond Yet,"This movie was totally entertaining for me. This is the Best Bond in terms of ""in shape"" (body is hard) and plays the most believable Bond ever. Action is first rate and storyline moves at a good pace. Thumbs Up!"
4,good tone but too long,"I was actually quite impressed with this Bond movie. It seemed a bit wittier and more thoughtfully written and almost a bit darker than other bond movies. But I felt they tried a little too hard to fill it with action. I was excited to buy my own copy of it (which I spent too much on) but then as I was watching it again after seeing it in the theatre, it seemed to get tiresome, in spite of all the action... or perhaps because of all the action. It was a well done Bond movie but I read the book and thought they could've fleshed out the characters and their relationships a little more, and given them a little more dialogue, alongside the glamorous Hollywood action-packed twenty-minute scenes."
3,"Fun, but disappointing for Bond...","I love Daniel Craig. But this movie bounced around too much. Too much concentration on car racing and explosion special effects. Not enough cool gadgets that are signature of a Bond movie. Coolest part is when he's poisoned and has to ""jumpstart"" his heart with his car."
2,Where's Sean Connery when we need him?,Didn't like the new 'James Bond'. If it wasn't sold as a '007' I probably would have liked it better. I miss Connery!
4,Not Sean Connery's Bond,Daniel Craig is excellent and so was the movie. I do miss the double entendre and string of sexual conquests from the original Bond movies I guess it's a Bond for a new generation - a lot more action oriented.
5,One of the Best,"One of the best bond movies every made and comes with both Bluray and DVD, makes for a great deal. Highly recommended !"
4,A good buy for a James Bond fan...,The debut of Daniel Craig as James Bond. It's a good James Bond movie that relaunches the series. I recommend it.
5,Total thriller,"Action packed, thriller! Daniel Craig doing his own stunts makes Bond more believable than ever before!! Definitely a must see!"
1,Poor quality,"DVD does not work, very poor quality and packaging was tampered with. Seems to me to be a pirate dvd"
2,The search continues for the next real Bond,"The character of Bond is unclear, undecided and for that reason seems poorly acted. I found the first 20 minutes of action without dialogue or real plot development quite boring. The female characters' lives were not explored at all so they seamed to be caricatures."
3,re: Casino Royale......,It seems that my disc is loosing sound quality. It was that way the minute I got it. At first it happened only once then it started to progress. I would have appreciated it if I was warned before hand. Aside from that it isn't scratched and it came on the right time.
3,Casino not very Royale,The most interesting part of the movie is the athletic chase at the beginning. However anyone who has climbed around a construction site knows that this kind of athletics around a construction site would lead to either sudden death or serious injury. It was Olympic class action.The rest of the movie would have been better without the gratuitous violence. In real life intelligence types operate quietly and efficiently.I rate this 3 stars because of the excessive violence.
2,NOT James Bond Anymore,"This can only be a low budget movie, as half the things that are synonymous with Bond movies are missing.1) The opening theme to all James Bond movies2) No Q3) No Austin Martin or Jaguar with gadgets ( in actual fact James has to gamble to get his transportation)4) Not a lot of girl's (previous James Bond's had at least 5 - 6 girls surrounding him)5) No SpectaWhy they used the James Bond title is beyond me, it seemed like any other thriller to me, and if had not been for the acting itself which was passable and the special effects which were good, I would have stopped watching it"
1,James Bond is A Secret Agent that would never fall in Love!!,"I thought this should have been 006 or some other agent. This was totally out of character he made a lot of noise wherever he was. The originally character played by Sean Connery had much more class, was a true secret agent with many creative hidden weapons and above all would never fall in love!! He as a confirmed bachelor and everyone knew that including the sexy women he met along the way!"
1,what was this,it doesnt even deserve any stars from me. the picture quality isnt that great. you would think that a movie like this would go out and try and use a video codec. it should have been vc-1 which is far better then mpeg-4. once again horrible movie with horrible acting
2,Not one of the top Bond films,"The quality of the sound of the dvd is not very good. You have to strain to hear what the characters are saying. That said, this is definitely not a top Bond film. Disjointed and trite. The Bond portrayed is not the suave, debonair figure we have come to love.I am sorry I spent money on it."
2,I had expected more,"Good parts: new Bond is OK, very physical and relatively pleasant, the pictures and supporting cast are great, stunts are simply great. The Obanno's attack is a very refreshing move and in my view the best episode of the movie.Bad parts:1. Bond girls are not up to the level set in the previous Bond movies and in all cases mutual attraction looks very unnatural.2. One hundred million dollars moment: governments do not care that much about $15 mln. anymore.3. The plot is annoyingly weak: e.g. the bad guy does not have his own crew capable of minor bombing etc etc."
5,Absolutely the best Bond since Sean Connery,"This movie should definitely succeed at its goal of reviving the Bond series. Updated for current times and starting anew from the beginning it works very well. Although there will always be some cheesiness in a Bond movie this one keeps it to a minimum. Bond is back to a more down to earth, gritty and even vulnerable human.The movie kicks off with intense action and then slows down to focus more on the plot. The second portion is far from boring though. The acting is very good, and the characters are believable for the most part.Very good movie and for once I am looking forward for the next one to come out. Highly recommended."
4,"A new, poker-faced Bond","I enjoyed this movie a lot, despite some dubious plot twists and a gruesome interrogation/torture scene that left me feeling a bit queasy. It will take some time getting used to Daniel Craig as Bond -- his interpretation of the man is different from any before -- but the movie generates plenty of tension in the second act, and there's lots of gorgeous scenery to enjoy along the way. Not a great movie, but a good one to be sure!"
5,Awesome Awesome Awesome,"At first, I was unhappy with this new Bond, since I have always liked Sir Sean Connery as 007. He will forever be the original. But Daniel Craig pulled it off! I totally was on the egde of my seat during the entire movie! I loved every sarcastic line Bond arrogantly delivered. I wanted Clive Owen to be Bond but I am very happy with how Danny worked it all through. Everyone in the packed matinee theater was equally entertained and many faces looked very happy too. And every other time we have been to a matinee it was never packed!I can't wait to buy the DVD and possibly go see this movie again!!!!"
3,Yellow haze ruins viewing on 2-disc Special Edition,"I liked the movie, I feel that they kept a lot of the Bond of yesterday and made Daniel Craig more realistic than Pierce Brosnan, who in my personal opinion was a bad choice for Bond. Casino Royale seems to emphasize more on characters and story than gadgetry, which was always what made Bond films fun. Overall I really enjoyed the film.Complaint: I now see I am not the only one experiencing this. Buyers beware of the 2 disc Special Edition DVD of Casino Royale. There appears to be an almost yellowish haze on the film, and it matters not which disc you have playing. After getting another copy back from Amazon, it also had the haze. I enjoyed the show but unfortunately this haze is annoying to me. If anyone has any ideas, or you happen to have one that does not have the haze, please let me know what I can do to get a copy that is not like the two I have so far tried from Amazon. Thank you-George"
5,casino royale,This is an awesome movie. I really liked because it takes a new approach and shows a more humanized bond rather than the ice cold smooth one you usally see. Now I'm not saying I don't like that bond because I do I was just glad to see a new take on a great franchise and can't wait to see the next one.
2,Movie did not play after a bit,"Its tough to pick a new vendor to get my dvds from. This one didnt work out as I expected. The dvd stopped playing in the middle of the movie, and I couldnt get it to work even after cleaning."
4,Daniel Craig is no Sean Connery... but who is?,"""Bond. James Bond.""With that introduction, you expect a good adventure thriller. In Casino Royale, we are introduced to yet another actor attempting to replace Sean Connery. In this, Daniel Craig fails. However, Daniel Craig does develop his own character, an early 007 in today's world.He's not a funny, witty man. And in this version. he is successful because he doesn't try to be a witty, funny 00.And that ending? You knew life was just too good to last, didn't you?"
4,Casino Royal,"This is a great movie with good sound. However, I feel it does not stand up to The World is not Enough or Quantum of Solice when it comes to the surround sound effects. Hence I give it 4 stars. Still a very good movie while the others above I feel are GREAT Movies."
4,Best Bond Movie!,"I've seen this movie like 5 times already and doesn't get old. I bought the BD 2 Disc Collector's Edition, I gotta tell you that looks amazing. BUT! is has some grain to the BD transfer. Thats why -1 star."
5,"My name is Bond, James Bond!",Great! We wait so many years to see Casino Royale on the big screen.This new James Bond is one of the best!The movie is awesome:Great placesGorgeous girlsDangerous gamingFull action
4,Love the movie not so sure about the DVD,"This is probably the thinest 2 disk set I have seen in a couple of years. The bonus features leave a lot to be desired. The most notable missing bonus is a Director's Commentary. There are no commentary tracks at all on this disk. There are several BLOG entries floating around the internet that claim Sony will release a ""Casino Royale Ultimate"" at some point in the future that will include several commentaries and additional bonus footage (deleted scenes etc). In my opinion this is an attempt by Sony to double dip the pockets of consumers."
3,Big disappointment!,"This Bond movie was a big disappointment. I'd give it 3.5 stars out of 5. A lot of people complained about the Bond time line in this movie, but you got to realize that it's hard to work with since Bond has been around for like 50 years, so this is negligible. Compared to the recent Bond movies with Brosnan, this movie was just not up to par. Though there were plenty of action scenes, they were not at all explosive. The car chase in the movie was extremely short, and also the end fight in the movie was not impressive. Though Craig Daniel is by no means a bad Bond, he's not nearly as good as Brosnan, Connery, and Moore. He doesn't have that charm/mojo that the other guys had when it comes to women. Also, he seems a bit too buff for Bond. I just hope that the next Bond movies will do a little more to accomodate today's crowd."
2,Excellent trailer - lousy movie,One long card game inturrupted by over-the-top violence. Opening sequence looks like a Cirque du Solei produced spoof of Bond film opening sequences. The new Bond comes off as thuggish - not a suave bone in his otherwise well-toned body. Skip this one.
2,subtitles major languages missing,"blue ray quality is fair, however it does support all major subtitles languages, missing spanish and other major such a s french"
4,Good Entertainment,"James Bond pictures must entertain. And this one certainly does. Bond is presented in this picture with a highlighted human side, something that was not presented with such clarity since ""On Her Majestic's Secret Service"" with one time Bond George Lazemby and Diana Rigg. Some of us may enjoy more than others the human side of 007 but I believe it does not hurt the movie. It is a well done action movie with a little romance. Please do not compare Daniel Craig to other actors that played the Bond character in the past. I would not say that one was better than other, I would say just different. You can have a personal favorite (mine continues to be Sean Connery (I particularly like it in Goldfinger). But I believe that Craig does a pretty good job. I am looking forward to the next one."
4,Political Correctness in full circle,"Although I enjoyed the movie, the fact that producers removed all scenes of smoking, while leaving in scenes of torture, makes me wonder where our priorities lie as a society......violence, okay, but if you smoke, heaven forbid!"
1,The First of A Series of Blunders for James Blond,"I recently rewatched this film to see if perhaps I overlooked what others have been saying is a great movie. What could they possibly like about Casino Royale?Daniel Craig is a horrible choice as James Bond. He has no charisma, charm or chemistry with the Bond girls. There wasn't an exciting Pre-title sequence, zero gadgets and the Aston Martin gets flipped over in a chase? What on earth were the screenwriters thinking? Moreover, the poker game takes up a good chunk of this movie and it is long and boring. The one other action scene involves a construction site where Craig is doing a series of jumps and climbs onto and off of cranes. In all honesty, it felt like another movie all together. Couldn't the writers think of something better?"
3,Not as good as the one before,I think that Pierce Bronson was a better James Bond. Casino Royale was an okay movie though.
3,Please bring back Sean or Roger!,"Disjointed stylised rubbish! Where has the tongue in cheek humour gone? Bond has always been a British secret agent who has had a hard side that has always only been hinted at, but this new Bond is hard with a sense of humour that is barely hinted at - the complete opposite of all the previous Bonds. Don't get me wrong, Daniel Craig is a very good James Bond, but he needs a decent screenplay to work with for goodness sakes! And where the hell is Q? Shoot the writers ('writers' plural because the film was obviously written by a committee), bring back Q (and the ""minister"")and give Craig a sense of humour and you'll have the perfect new Bond. Rent this movie by all means but don't waste your money buying it - you'll only watch it once (and wonder at what could have been). Three stars for the chase at the beginning."
3,Reinvention,"Traditions challenged! But this reinvention of Bond holds the potential for a long run. Every generation reinvents itself, and perhaps Bond too. Only time will tell where this Bond will fit in the Bond Pantheon."
1,"BRING BACK PIERCE BROSNAN, PRONTO!!!","I'm boycotting any more Bond movies unil the powers-that-be behind this franchise come to their senses & bring back the sexiest Bond ever, & the only one I'll ever be interested in, PIERCE BROSNAN! Daniel Craig is a boring dolt, a dud, & he'll never match up to Pierce Brosnan. I WAS SO HAPPY THAT THIS MOVIE WAS BEAT OUT of the #1 SPOT AT THE BOX OFFICE BY AN ANIMATED PENGUIN ON OPENING WEEKEND, HAPPY FEET--I THINK THAT SAYS IT ALL!! I hope the right people are reading this review: WHAT YOU DID TO PIERCE BROSNAN WAS TERRIBLY WRONG, & YOU'VE GOT IT WRONG: HE'S DEFINITELY NOT TOO OLD TO STILL BE BOND, HOW RIDICULOUS!! BRING BACK PIERCE, PRONTO!"
1,Casino Royale Blu-ray,This disc will not play on region 4 players (Australia) the only one that i have purchased (over 40 titles) that is fully encoded. Amazon were kind enough to give me a full refund. Great people to deal with.
2,The Film is 5 stars. The DVD is 2.,"If you have seen the superb MGM DVDs of the original Bond films, you will be disappointed here.This is nothing like those. No director's commentary, in fact, no commerntary at all, and just two minor documentary pieces. With all the wonderful material on the website, one wonders why none of that was included: like the description of the Aston Martin stunt work, the background on the casting. Nothing.Buy this for the film, which is wonderful. But it is not much of a DVD."
2,Yawn,This was so boring. I am not a Bond fan but I thought this one would spark my interest. Ugh was I wrong. It felt like it was 3 hours long. It just dragged and dragged. The action scenes were OK. I saw nothing in this that I haven't seen in every other movie. I guess I will continue to be a Non-Bond fan.
2,"Worst Bond film, hands down","If the Star Wars prequels showed us anything its that going back to making a prequel to a old movie is a BAD idea, and this film is NO exception. This Bond is supposed to be set pre Dr. No, yet there are:1) cell phones, technology that did not exist then2) laptops, again that did not exist back then (especially not a Sony VAIO which was shamelessly marketed)3) Very elaborate tracking system, much more sophisticated than a radioisotope tracker used in Dr. No4) Modern weapons5) Texas Hold em, not BaccaratJust to mention a few. Sure the acting may be great in parts, like the torture scene, but the whole movie just feels drawn out like they couldn't stop. Kids and first time Bonders will probably like this, but for thoes of us who have seen every Bond movie from Dr. No to Die Another Day (including Never Say Never Again), it is a movie that should never have been made, which is why they made Dr. No first and not Casino Royale."
1,Casino Royale,"I found it absolutely outragous the following:1) I pre-ordered this item mid-February and with shipping I paid approx. 10.2) It will arrive to my adress some time in April according to the most recent mail.3) Today (March 19th), I could walk into any stores in the U.K. and buy it for 9.99 - AND WATCH IT IN MY LIVING ROOM.I FEEL ABSOLUTELY CHEATED BY AMAZON - IT HAPPENED BEFORE AND I WILL NOT BUY ANY NEW RELASES THROUGH YOU IN THE FUTURE!TR"
5,Love this movie!,"I was skeptical at first when they selected Daniel Craig. I've seen him before in other movies and didn't see how he could be Bond, but it worked out well. There's tons of action and none of the cheesey computer animation and dumb gadgets that the Pierce Brosnan Bond seemed to rely on so much during the last couple movies. They even slipped some humor in there and had a few nice laughs. Overall, oustanding movie!"
1,Like a 2 hour Sony commercial,"I'm no stranger to product placement, nor am I against it, but when I saw this movie, I couldn't help but feel the experience was cheapened by all the close-ups on Sony products. When the camera purposely zooms in to show Blu-ray on a disc, PSP on the back of a videogame system, or Cybershot on a camera, it gets a little annoying. It's no surprise that Sony placed all those products, it is a Sony Pictures film, but the purposely placed shots of Sony products was too much for me to handle.There wouldn't have been an issue if there were a Pepsi sign in the background, or if a character used a Cybershot camera; but when a shot zooms in to show the brand, model, or format, I call commercial. If this is what all James Bond movies are going to be like, I might as well just stay home and watch TV. I don't pay to go to a theater to be bereted by a two-hour long Sony commmercial, and I won't pay to do it again."
5,"Great movie, one of the best Bond films ever...","I am a life-long Bond fan. I am one of the few Bond fans I know of that actually has positive things to say about all of the Bonds. Connery, Lazenby, Moore, Dalton, and Brosnan all were different and brought what the producers thought they needed to bring to the franchise. But, Craig was a great addition to the franchise. I don't care if he's blond-headed and blue-eyed. He is a great fit for where the Bond franchise is headed.Also, the movie plot, action sequences, direction, etc. all took huge leaps in the right direction. I was very concerned about the future of the franchise after the horrible computer enhanced, over-the-top unbelieveable garbage they pulled in Die Another Day.Casino Royale is what Bond films were and should be!"
5,Casino Royale DVD - prequel to 007 James Bond legend,Greatest chase scene ever recorded. Daniel Craig could become the Sean Connery replacement in your mind when you think of 007.
1,pitful,james is suppost to be suave with class. what this bond is thug material.if this is before james become 007 material how come all cars are new and m is a woman? give us a james with class.
1,WEAK!!!,"Absolutely the worst James Bond movie ive ever seen!! Whenever I think of James Bond films I think of suave men, beautiful women, great cinematography and great music scores. This is Low Budget Bond!!"
1,Talk about a boring bond!,I just rented the DVD after several people told me how wonderful it was. This guy has no charisma. I could have cared less about what happened to him or the girl.What a total waste of my time! I am surprised at all the great reviews of this movie. And what a waste of Judy Dench! I'm not waiting for the next Bond if this guy is going to be the next 007!
3,A mixed debut,"Daniel Craig is a terrific actor, and his Bond has some of the hard edge of Sean Connery's. But the world that spawned James Bond is gone, and that undermines this film. Like so many contemporary action films, it goes on and on, piling on the twists - mixing this with therapeutic character interactions (e.g., ""M"" advising Bond on how he should regard his girlfriend) that the real Bond would never have tolerated. Bond's casual ruthlessness, his old-fashioned masculinity, is permanently MIA. The book CASINO ROYALE was as simple and potent as a karate chop; the film loses much of that effect. It's often entertaining (especially the clever opening sequence) but it sure ain't DOCTOR NO."
3,"Casino Royale, last edition","Prefer much more the older version, which is much more entertaining. This version is too violent and hard to follow, but I'm glad I have now a complete collection of the James Bond films."
4,New Casino Royale Version,"A new actor portrays James Bond:Daniel Craig an englishman known of some Tv series and some high budget films as Munich.Before he holds his licence to kill Bond is elevated to 00 status.His first mission to locate a arms dealer knows as Le Chiffre.This takes him from Bahamas to Madagascar,Miami,playing deck at Montenegro and finishing in Venice.Action secuences are well staged as usual but I miss the Q character and the gadgets.Even the Aston Martin doesn't have any as crashes too soon.I hope next Bond film have these improvements as classic Bond films had."
4,A bonus with the blu-ray player,"I was lucky to get three bonus Blu-ray discs free when I purchased the Panasonic 360 Blu-Ray Player for my son as a present for Christmas. The movies included in the offer; Made of Honor, 21, and Casino Royale, which were all discs of movie +BD live, which made him happy. He really enjoyed Casino Royale and the added new material.Mom was happy the gift turned out to be an even greater success than expected. Thanks Amazon."
4,Great movie and well featured set,"The movie itself is pretty good and now this two-disc set in blu-ray makes the package even better which may or may not be worth the premium charged for blu-ray. The only con I have, which is technically and not related to the film itself, is the lack of a spanish soundtrack. Although most people don't need it I have to use it sometimes and the thing that bugs me the most is that all the other DVD and Blu-Ray versions of the film do have a spanish language track. Wonder why the most expensive variation of the film does not have it. Other than that I recommend this movie to anyone who likes this genre."
5,3.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Casino Royale features well-directed (no shaky cam here) and visceral action sequences used to service a clever plot, an effective villain, a beautiful and intelligent Bond girl played with panache by Eva Green, and a tremendous debut by Craig; I've seen every Bond film so believe me when I tell you that it easily cracks the top 5."
3,"Good, but not my fave by far","Entertaining, as all Bond films are, but definitely not one of my faves. However, and this is a big BUT, the stunts are awesome!"
2,Disappointed,"I have had a copy of this film on my DVR and was always annoyed by the commercials and the fact that it was edited for time, hence I ordered it. The DVD had so many seizing freezing and at times whole sections skipped that I just fast forwarded past all the jittery nonsense. What a waste, I ended up watching the DVR copy anyway! To make it worse I had it for quite awhile and decided to watch it because nothing worthwile was on TV only to discover such poor viewing quality."
1,Love it and hate it,"I love the content of the discs but I wonder why this bluray ''collector's edition'' did not includes the booklet of the dvd? it's annoying!!!. I hate the edition , it's too simple."
1,Terrible miscasting - Craig is no Connery,"The Bond character has no class, no style, no humor - the character has been rendered lifeless. Do yourself a favor and pass this one up in favor of one of the Sean Connery Bond films."
2,emilie,"What a bore. I wasn't really excited to this the blonde bond but I went to see it anyway because the last one with pierce was so so good but anyway on with the review. This movie was boring. No gadgets that bond usually has. No witty conversations. If you watch it most of the time they aren't saying anything just chasing eachother and the casino scene is about 20 minutes too long. And the vilian with the bleeding eye? So what!!!! Eva as the bond girl was stupid. The other girl that got killed should have been the bond girl. Eva looked too homely to be considered hot. And oh the blonde bond, what ever his name is isn't hot either!"
1,Worst Bond movie of all time!,"This is a chick flick!It has more elements of a love story that action.I am very disappointed.This will never be a part of my JB collection,as I am selling it ASAP."
3,Double Oh 7's New Mission (Rating: 7 out of 10- -3.5 stars),"Watching the newest installment of the 007 James Bond series, I felt I got what I paid for. A lot of action scenes and fighting. Most of the acting was on point, especially for Daniel Craig having some big shoes to fill for the fact that the previous parts were played by Ian Flemmings and Roger Moore. It seemed like the big thing missing was the gadgets, not enough of them. That kind of made me a little dissapointed. Also the ending of the movie was kinda loose, leaving me wondering what was going to happen. I don't know if that was intended to be like that or what, but it was just kind of hanging. This is a good movie that is worth checking out. Had many humorous scenes (like the poker table scene), that I enjoyed very much. If you're looking for an action movie, check this out."
4,"""Casino"" Gets ""Royale"" DVD Treatment - 3/13/07","Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has revealed some early details on ""Casino Royale"" which stars Daniel Craig, Eva Green, Judi Dench, and Jeffrey Wright.The two-disc collector's edition will include a Becoming Bond documentary that takes an intimate look at how Daniel Craig stepped into the role of the 6th James Bond, a James Bond: For Real featurette that looks at the action and stunts, a Bond Girls are Forever featurette that takes a closer look at Bond's leading ladies, a Death in Venice featurtte, and the Chris Cornell `You Know My Name' music video. The film itself will receive an anamorphic widescreen presentation, and English Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround track."
5,One Disc Please!,"I just want the Wide Screen Version (period). One Disc. Maybe a trailer! I don't need 6 hrs. of rubbish! Oh, by the way, did a mention the discount $15 price for only one disc instead of two? Thank you!"
2,Bond with no taste,Misconceived portrayal of James Bond 007 is not true to Ian Fleming's creation and cannot hold a candle to Sean Connery. No knowledge of food or champagne. The true Bond is a gourmet and wine connoisseur. Craig exposes his wweaknesses to all and sundry. The real 007 keeps his weaknesses concealed as all true Spooks do. Dr. Michael Lim The Travelling Gourmet
1,BOOOORING,"God is it boring! If I wanted to watch people play cards for an hour and a half... I WOULDN'T SPEND $30 TO DO IT!!! SHEESH! By the way, that's the plot, I just saved you an hour and a half of your life.About Bond himself, how is it that this is supposed to be his first mission? He's got BLUE EYES AND BLONDE HAIR. Are we supposed to believe that he changed them? And why is it set in modern times(the 2000's)? IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE HIS FIRST MISSION, REMEMBER? Never mind Bond movies have made since the 60's, but come on!! Bring back Pierce Brosnan please!!"
1,We need Hugh Jackman as James Bond!,Hugh Jackman could breathe life into the new James Bond as Pierce Brosnan did during his Bond reign! Daniel Craig is a bland dummy- just a cardboard character actor and Hugh Jackman would have been eye candy!I say let's see Hugh Jackman in a jet pack as Bond in a precredit action sequence over Seattle's Space Needle! Bring back Michelle Yeoh as Chinese agent Wai Lin and team up with Bond to stop General Chang(from Tomorrow Never Dies- he escaped from Beijing when Eliott Carver(Jonathan Pryce) could make him the next Premier of China by bombing Beijing with a nuclear missile from his stealth boat! Have General Chang have a new ambition on invading Taiwan! What a great movie that would be!
1,Daniel Craig is a phony,"I didn't care to watch it when it was in theaters and I was right. I just watched it on DVD and really sorry for the time wasted. Staring at the wall for 2 hours would be more rewarding.The movie is a set of disjointed action sequences (which are nothing special by themselves) following each other with no rhyme or reason. Daniel Craig is another in the line of impostors unsuccessfully trying to fill Sean Connery's shoes (even Pierce Brosnan was better then DC, and PB wasn't very good either). Other characters are not even 2-dimensional - they are one-dimensional. Really bad acting all around. I was constantly annoyed by something until I figured out what it was: facial expression of the actors when they were saying their lines was irrelevant to what they where doing."
1,What a Waste of Time,"If the main character of this movie had been named anything else, it never would have been made--or if it had been, it would have lasted about a week in theaters and then disappeared. While the acting is good, the actors have nothing to work with. No plot, no worthwhile dialogue, nothing.Someday, it would be interesting to see someone actually make a movie from the Ian Flemming books. This movie borrows a Flemming title, two scenes (and a general idea of gambling though the particular card game has changed to ""reflect modern sensibilities"" I suppose).The best part of this movie was the ending, but just because that meant it was over."
2,yuk,"After much anticipation we were very disapointed with this new ""the best ever Bond"" - the critics can't have seen any of the previous films to give this such a rating - the plot sucks with so much flashing and jumping around to different subjects and they could have cut that stupid card game by at least 1/2 an hour - gone is the intriging world of fantasy and gadgets the Bond films have always portrayed if this is the 'new Bond' we will be rewatching the old classics and put this one in the ""forget"" file"
1,Please Give Me A Real James Bond,"I just bought this movie, I was expecting action and there is no shortage of that. But where was Q, the wonderful gadgets and cool cars. Not to mention Bond driving a Ford come on that was sad. Also, where were the enfamous Bond love scenes, James Bond would never leave a woman to follow some enemy, he would make love to her and then take care of business. The plot was not the best not mention hard to keep up with. I am so disappointed that I bought this movie instead of renting it. And finally a blond Bond, he looks like the guy who James beats up and kills, the villian not James Bond. Find another Sean Connery, or Pierce Bosnan they pull it off."
5,best Bond,"I didn't expect Daniel Craig to be a good Bond. I was so wrong. He was the best I've seen. This film is- fast,- well-written,- cast very well, and- classy.What I really liked about this film over many other Bond film is that gadgetry and the traditional 'spy stuff' was left out of it (this seems over done in most films). It didn't make a mockery of itself like some other Bond and spy films. Bond's promiscuity was evident but Craig carried these scenes with some integrity... typically these scenes seem forced into movies... they weren't (as) forced in this movie. [This is the only Bond film I have cared enough to buy.]"
4,Great Bond,"This is a great Bond film and a satisfying reset to the franchise. However, I can't believe it got a PG-13 rating. This is a very violent film with some disturbing images of death and torture - much grittier than previous Bond outings and far more reminiscent of Flemming's novels. IMO, it should have received an R. Be that as it may, if you're a Bond fan, I suspect you'll love Casino Royale."
5,amazing,"I won't bore you too much with a technical review here. This is simply the best looking Bluray movie I own. Watching in 1080p, this movie is easily one of the best looking I have. My new showcase DVD along with Planet Earth.(Certain parts of Planet Earth anyway.) As far as the movie itself it is a very intelligent James Bond movie that answers alot of questions about why Bond is how he is. He makes all the rookie mistakes and is introduced to his future tradmarks (Shaken not stirred martini etc). Daniel Craig makes a great James Bond. Kinda proves that the character is not about looks but acting and Craig captures the spirit of James Bond completly. (I should also mention that it has one of the best foot chase scenes Iv'e ever seen in a movie. Almost Jackie Chan ish but without the comedy.)"
3,Casino Royal- Does Not feel like a real Bond film!,"If you've seen all the previous Bond movies, if you've read any of the bond novels by Ian Fleming, then this is just another action movie by our 21st century standards. Our ""NEW"" Bond (in my opinion) does NOT, I repeat does NOT capture the true flavor of the Bond personality. He's a fast shooter, but other than that, he didn't act like the bond we know. For example, he allowed himself to be poisened by a drink at the Casino (not careful enough for 007!). He over trusted his lady partner with millions of dollars. He's too serious and even harsh, no Bond usual charm. For the new generation that has not seen Sean Connery's best and Roger Moore's best and even Brosnan's best, this maybe a good action movie. I think the new Bond (Daniel Craig) is a fine actor, but definately not a credible James Bond! Also, what happened to the beautiful Bond movies Blondes? there aren't any here!!"
2,Disappointed,"I had heard this was the best Bond yet. Not in my opinion. Yes there was a lot of good action. But Bond was fooled by the girl he fell for. He was going to leave the Service, another questionable (Bond being Bond) part of the movie. England used to rule the world. Now Bond is going the way of England."
3,"If the DVD doesn't play, contact Sony","It's a very good movie, but this disk problem has been a real hassle. You need to contact Sony to request a replacement disk. We have a Harman/Kardon DVD 50, and the disk we purchased from Amazon makes the player reboot. So, first I requested an exchange from Amazon, because the bonus features disk was cracked in the case. The exchange arrived promptly (thanks Amazon), but the new disk still wouldn't play. I checked the Harman/Kardon website FAQs and got the following information:There was an issue with revised copy protection software that Sony Corp. of America placed on these discs at the time of manufacture, and any playability issues you are experiencing are not due to a problem with your Harman Kardon DVD player. Sony has rectified the situation, and you may contact them to request a replacement disc. For more information, please call Sony Pictures Home Entertainment Customer Service at 800-860-2878."
5,Casino Royal: Best opening chase scene ever,"Greatest opening chase scene I've ever seen. Better than all the other Bond films--which are all terrific. Beautiful locations At the One and Only Beach Club on Pardise Island, Montenegro, and Venice. Great action. The ending really blew me away."
4,Another great Bond film,"James Bond at it again, doing what James Bond does. Action, beautiful women, cool cars, this movie has everything a Bond enthusiast is looking for."
4,"Good Movie, bad Codec","This is a great Bond movie, but if you were looking for a great Bond movie, you could just get the DVD. Of bigger concern is how is the movie as a blu-ray. Well, first off all, it does have a fantastic picture. It most certainly beats anything on a normal DVD or on TV in HD by far, but it unfortunately still can't beat some of it's brethren. This is due to the fact that Sony decided not to use the VC-1 codec. Not that the movie doesn't look fantastic, because it absolutely does, but in this reader's opinion, the image quality just isn't quite as sharp as in, per say, The Departed. Like I said, it still looks fantastic, but The Departed just has a bit of extra something special that makes it particularly stand out."
4,Casino Royale Review,"Yikes, what with new A/V effects, and the predilection of our current generation of movie makers, (and watchers), to seek ever greater thrills, and spills, this movie is violent and brutal. I am sure the effect will wear off over time and my intellectual detachment will go into overide, but so far I have only been able to watch it once."
5,Great movie,"Very crisp picture viewing it on Amazon Prime. But, some of the dialogue was washed out by the action sequences: subtitles would be nice.."
3,Returned,"I returned this item. I ordered the wrong version. Please refer to my other order...""Full Screen"" version for the review for this movie."
3,Casino Royale,"This new James Bond movie introduces a slightly darker tone of events but with a excellent plot and a scheme by the bad guy that doesn't seem far-fetched. The movie doesn't indulge in as much sexual content though there are a few scenes but the movie does show a lot more violence than you would expect from a PG-13. Casino Royale is one of those movies where at times the plot is pretty hard to follow but if you get past all the missteps, you should enjoy this movie. I recommend that children over 13 or at the least minimum, 12, should be the only ages for children to see this film. Some parents might not want them to see a drowning, nail gun to the eye, lots of shooting, strangling, and punching that can appear pretty graphic at times. In conclusion, Casino Royale is a good plot story with a reasonable evil scheme and plenty of special effects (not to mention athletic)action!"
4,Good James Bond,The storyline is real good and Daniel Craig does a good job as Bondthe action is good but some needs to be toned downA very worth watching movie
4,Casino Royale,"It had no problem playing, so that's a thumbs up for me and it is definetly a plus :)Thank you"
5,"The Best Bond Since ""Goldfinger""!","I am extremely amazed that Hollywood can still respect James Bond after all this time! Pierce Bronsnan became Bond, I thought the series was as good as dead, but Daniel really pulled it off! I don't want to give anything away, so anyone who wants to see this movie will just have to wait and see it!-Ben Russell"
1,"Misleading condition rating: not ""like new"" or ""very good""","Was a used disk and case that had been removed from circulation at a public library. Disc played fine, but both disc and case had suffered a lot of wear and tear. When the product arrived in the mail, I was very disappointed. I would not have purchased it if it had been labeled accurately: ""good"" or ""acceptable."""
3,Maybe it's my fault?,"Perhaps I set my expectations to high for this movie based on past 007 films. When the movie finished I was disappointed. The BD was technically very very nice, sounds / video was incredible! The movie content...Not so good, IMHO.~e"
1,"Don't buy Sony DVDs, they don't work","I now have two copies of the Casino Royal DVD and neither will play in my brand new Sony 400 disc changer. The product divisions at Sony have their heads so far up their own A...s that their products are not even compatible with each other. This issue is not isolated to the one movie.The recommendation is, if it says Sony on the disk, don't buy it. It isn't worth the hassle since most places won't return a DVD or at best will only replace it with the same defective copy."
5,OUT OF THIS WORLD,"because it's down to earth...all the bond's trademark flare, women, lifestyle are there but more realistic. it's also dark, violent, cold. the most emotionally complex bond. love to see how the relationahip between bond and vesper develops gracefully without hinting any hidden emotions (""are they or are they not in love with each other"")...not sure if the great Mr.Connery himself could pull it off. this is how the series should be...go see it..."
2,Lacking the Bond Fantasy from the past.,"I found that I wasted my money buying this 2-disc set. Casino Royale doesn't compair to any of the previous James Bond movies.Daniel Craig displays the James Bond image but the lacking effects that you normally saw in previous 007 movies, makes this one, almost a sleeper , if it wasn't for the beautiful scenery and Craigs acting.The excitement of the past Bond movies is very much lacking in this one. What happened to the suspence,action of all the uniqe gagets that Bond used.Needed MORE ACTION!!!"
3,This bond lacks charm,What we got here is Rambo meets james Bond. The best Bond for me was Sean Connery and Roger Moore since they both possessed charm and a subtle ruthlessness.. Craig on the other hand is to blunt and rough around the edges. The story overall lacks a big villain. I never got the feeling that Bond was saving the world as was the case with most other bond flicks. The story was interesting enough to keep my attention. The romance was'nt believable. His love interest looked way to conservative to sway a guy like him.
5,Really Good,"I have been a Bond fan from the beginning, and must agree with several other reviewers that Craig is the best Bond since Connery. He brings a toughness and believability to the role which has been missing for a long time. Real secret service operatives who do what Bond does are often ex-military special forces types, not dandies who worry about whether their martinis are shaken or stirred. This hard edge comes through in many of Ian Fleming's books: Casino Royale captures that tone, as did the early Bond films with Connery. Many of the other films with Moore, Dalton, and Brosnan seem almost cartoonish by comparison."
3,"Too Complicated, Unreal, and Long","Bond's latest adventure begins, after a quick bathroom killing, with an unreal and elongated chase high among the beams in an African construction site. Acrophobics may be thrilled, but the unreality is overwhelming for most.Eventually the plot ends up in a enormously high-stakes card game as the villains attempt to regain the funds they lost shorting the market before Bond ruined their scheme. So its Bond behind cards, making high bets and relying on ""tells,"" instead of flirting with Ms. Moneypenny and using the latest high-tech from Q Department to evade capture.Eventually his latest love turns out to be a ""turncoat"" and dies, and Bond finds himself on the beach in an attempt by the producers to set the stage for the next adventure.Bottom-Line: Confused and boring."
1,Missed opportunity,"Casino Royale (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)This should have been a film to remember yet it is not. The plot is unoriginal and weak, the acting mediocre, the characters unconvincing, the situations are juvenile and stray well beyond the bounds of silliness whilst the film itself is so poorly made that the soundtrack is for much of the time quite inaudible.If this is the best that can be done, perhaps it is time to bury Mr Bond, once and for all."
1,much ado about nothing,"a waste of time...Daniel Craig is a lousy 007...having seen every james bond movie several times, this movie makes very little sense. Nice stunts as always; but the love plot with Vesper did/does not work, too much time is spent on it, and the real bond would not have wasted his time with this SKANKY looking shrew. Hopefully the next attempt at anything Bond will deal less with an hour worth of Texas hold em (i can watch the WSOP for this if needed), minimal plot spent on a love line, and a Bond who wont be a guy with little or no acting ability. If I could give a ""0"" for this movie, I would. Go buy ""license to kill"" or ""the world is not enuff."" At least those movies have something more believable than a blond/blue bond who is totally out of his league. Crap movie, must have been produced with ladies in mind. Bring back Plenty O Toole."
3,"Interesting, but no plot to speak of","There are too many characters and I was unsure of who most of them were until they made it obvious. I was still looking for a plot halfway through, although it was interesting enough to keep watching just to see how it ended.In spite of the abundance of action, it was a bit of a snoozer. There has to be more to a movie, especially one of the Bond ilk, than just a Bond actor that looks good. This one just doesn't seem to be about anything. I wouldn't mind seeing Mr. Craig in another Bond film, but one with a better storyline."
4,Good...not great,"While I am a fan of Bond movies, I don't think this was the best. I don't like Daniel Craig as well as Pierce Brosnan. Now that is good eye candy!"
2,"The name is Bond, but not James Bond","Every critics said this is the best bond ever, but they never said why. Every body said, Craig is the new Bond, because he is the closest Bond as Ian Fleming books said, but I just wondering how many of you ever read the book. Why suddenly every body care what Ian Fleming wrote, are the previous Bonds did not based on the character. Worrying their new Bond not convincing enough, they even shot a screen in the train where Bond first met Vesper, trying to tell the audience, What Bond should be, it's just pathetic. I do not know the Bond Fleming wrote, but I saw every Bond movies, and I am sure this new Bond is not James.Casino Royale plot is simple, out to date (written 1953) and confusing for everyone who do not know what Poker game is. Just like M said in the movie, how she missed the cold war, this Bond movie should have much larger scale than a terrorist that love gambling.Two stars, Just because they said this is a Bond movie."
5,By far the best Bond movie yet.,"This is defiantly the best Bond move to come out so far. The fighting in it was much better then with Pierce Brosnan (I realize that doesn't say a whole lot, but it is really good anyways). I like how he didn't have to use all these strange and impossible to make gadgets. The only slightly negative things I could think of to say about it is the Aston Martin doesn't get enough screen time and that when you think the movie is almost over you find out there is more to the story which makes it feel a little longer then it is.All in all this is a great movie that any action movie lover will enjoy, regardless of wither or not they liked any of the other Bond movies (because I don't really care for them)."
5,Back to Bond basics,"As one of those guys who has seen every Bond flick since Dr. No on opening day, I had my reservations about Craig and the concept of rebooting the Bond franchise. My fears were unfounded. This movie stands out as one of the best Bonds ever. Keep an open mind and realize that Bond doesn't become ""Bond. James Bond"" until the last scene. My only true disappointment was the title song and credit sequence."
5,Outstanding!,Daniel Craig has moved the bar way as the newest 007 actor. This Blu-ray disc is incredible. Amazing video and over-the-top soundtrack.The story line is a much-improved version of the James Bond series. Great extras on this disc.
4,Casino Royale,Pretty good but I don't understand why James Bond fell so in love with Vesper. Wasn't really believable. But it's James Bond and I do love these movies!!!
1,this is not James Bond,even though it is a James Bond movie i do not at all classify it to the others at all. no real special gadgets like the other Bonds.
2,"Craig is great, but the film isn't anywhere near Fleming's Bond!","I think I'll make a film called ""Mutiny on the Bounty."" No, it won't be about Fletcher Christian and it won't take place on a sailing vessel. It will be about a housewife who finds that ""Bounty"" isn't the quickest picker-upper and then rebels out front of the local supermarket with a lot of other wives.That's what ""Casino Royale"" was to me. They took a famous title and hooked it to a famous film franchise; then they made it 21st Century film gritty and completely changed the character of Bond into Tom Cruise's Mission Impossible mirror image.Indeed Daniel Craig is a fine new actor and acts with fierce intensity. But this isn't Bond. This is a new character which someone should have been brave enough to rename and start a new franchise.At first I gave it 3 stars, but I then had to make it 2."
2,bond movie stands alone,i know casino royale is the first story of james bond but the movie has judi dench as m which basically says lets forget about the other 20 bond films from 1962-2003. casino royale would of been great it it was set in the 50's or 60's so it flows with the other bond films before it.Q isn't in the film but you don't see Q until from russia with love. so it kind of makes sense but the whole m situation they should of got a guy to play m to live up to bernard lee.
5,"My name is Craig, Daniel Craig","Daniel Craig is the coolest Bond ever. He is tough and all male... he is a Bond thug... he is so proud of his buff bod... finds every chance to show it including a nude torture scene where Le Chiffre compliments him. The plot is tight... the explotions are Lethal Weapon. This is Bond playing homage to similar action flicks like Lethal Weapon, Bourne series. It is great now that flim producers try to revamp long movies series starting with Batman. With the Craig Bond, kid you have many more to go.. and we will be waiting."
5,RIGHT ON THE MONEY!,"I think that this book is extremely informative. It is presented from a fire fighter's point of view which is quickly adaptable. Their is so much info. and great suggestions i will be rereading it. Any new Officer should make this a must read and reread,extremely helpful.The author does respond to emails which demonstrates his professionalism.Good read, Easy read, Highly recommend! Full Time Paid Fire Fighter."
4,Very informative and down to earth,"I am not a professional fire fighter, only had a short basic course in the army (National Guard type unit), so I review the book as a volunteer/assistant fire fighter.Only downside is the many examples of how certain departments do the wrong thing, sometimes with disastrous results. I guess it enhances learning, but there is a bit of finger pointing at unnamed departments.I found the info on ventilation and dangers of structure fires especially informative as this was not covered on my basic education."
4,Crimson Joy,Was on vacation and took my Kindle along to the beach.Crimson Joy was a very fast read. I did not want to put itdown.Love Spenser's stories.
4,Good Spenser,"A truly adult story, with an eerie feel to it unlike most Parker stories. THe story presented chracter development in Belson and Quirk and displayed a deeper understanding of the Spenser/Silverman relationship. The most satisfying Spenser I've ever read."
4,a spenser fan,"I've been reading the few Spenser books I've missed over the years and Crimson Joy was one of them. The interaction between Hawk and Spenser is great as usual but if I would be a fan of Silverman (which I'm not), I'd be lukewarm about her role in this particular story. One thing unusual about this story line is that it's pretty gruesome and more like a Patterson book vs the Spenser books I love. No matter, I recommend all Parkers Spenser books as EZ entertaining reads. The interaction and personalities depicted are my favorite part (Quirk always a welcome addition)."
3,Good Story,"This is a departure for Parker, as some of the story is told from the point of view of the villain. It's a very suspenseful read, and I liked how how strong Susan was; you may not always enjoy her, but in this one she seems to be a person apart from Spenser, which gives her some reality. Not just a pretty face who finds it ""irresistable to be loved so completely."" My biggest problem is Parker's simplistic Freudian psychology. Guess why the serial killer kills? Surprise - it's his mother's fault. Parker does tend to take the easy and obvious route with the motivations of his characters, and that isn't always a bad thing, but it gets wearying when you read the whole series. Spenser, the ultimate autonomous man, would never say his father (or anyone else) is responsible for his actions. So why should anybody else's parents take the blame? Gimme a break."
4,THE WHOLE GANG,"This is the 15th story in the Spenser series, enjoyable and not one of the best. The main characters are here: Hawk (always like this cool character), Quirk, Belson, and of course, psychotherapist and main squeeze Susan Silverman. RBP lays out a good story with the cop-shrink conflict in releasing information, with the usual witty repartee back and forth between them, and as always, the dialogue with Hawk is superb. I always appreciate how fit Parker must have been, because as he got older, he could still recall and relate how some of the physical acts occurred like fighting and running (or was it good writing and a creative imagination?). I am always searching for the RBP's books that I missed while living my own good life. Good job RBP - rest in peace."
5,A book of hope,"There are times when you read a book at just the right time in your life and this is one of those books and times. Hurricane Katrina took so much away from Biloxi MS, but more than anything material, it took away the hope and spirit of so many, myself included. The holiday season started out so bleakly and I admit that I just wanted it to be over, but when you have children you know you have to find the strength to make it as wonderful as possible. It was a struggle until I read A Season of Miracles. I started the book and before I knew it I could feel myself smiling and just feeling good about everything. This book made me believe in miracles again but most of all the miracle of a better tomorrow. It makes you feel so good inside and you cannot help but feel a little sad when you come to the last page, as you feel as if you are leaving behind friends you have come to know and care about. This book is a miracle in itself and one which I will read over and over again."
5,Delightful!!!,"I so loved this book. The characters were vividly written and the stories was utterly charming. Its both heart warming and a book you will not want to put down. And although all the stories were marvelous, I have to say I was quite taken with Adrianne Byrd's ""Wishing On A Star"". I would and will reccomend this book to everyone."
4,Great book in the tradition of heartwarming Christmas tales,This book helped me to remember the true meaning behind Christmas and the value of embracing the spirit of giving.
4,Beautiful Watch,"This is a lovely timepiece at a fantastic price and I love it! Ladies, please consider that this watch is on the larger side and is a bit heavy on the wrist, if that is something that would affect your decision to buy. Having said that, it is a wonderful bargain and a striking looking piece that is versatile enough to dress up or down, or wear with either silver and/or gold toned jewelry. I am very pleased with my purchase and have received many compliments already."
5,Nice watch,"I bought it for my wife's birthday. She's really happy, looks elegant but also goes very well with sport clothes. Fully recommended !!"
5,excellent buy!,"I can't imagine a cashmere sweater at this quality with this price! Good feel, good style, not sheer at all, and excellent price!"
5,a collection of gems,"I believe this truly holds some of Cave's best efforts. Definately for the die-hard fan, perhaps a few songs for a curious listener. The packaging is unique, and has all sorts of goodies inside.Much a fan of Disc 1."
1,I Don't Get It,"I heard the track 'Time Jesum Transeuntum Et Non Riverentum' from a documentary and had to have it. I had heard of Nick Cave but not heard his music. I found the album at a decent price on eBay and figured it might be a good introduction to the artist. I always felt like I have had an open mind when it comes to music, and when I buy a cd I make it a point to listen to each track. I've gotten through the first two discs of this collection. What a bunch of crap... Other than a few chuckles and the track I previously mentioned, I don't get it. It sounds like Richard Thompson doing a bad impression of Frank Zappa. I wonder if his other albums are worth a listen? I'll have to give them a chance and maybe it will help me appreciate these B-sides more."
4,Mel Stenger,"I had beautiful flower vines on growing on my back chainlink fence. The neighbors to the rear repeatedly chopped the vines all the way to the fence, thus killing most of it. I first hung plastic netting that was diamond shaped and expanded and stretched; that type of netting became tangled and did not work well. I hung the new trellis from the top of the chainlink fence to let the flowers use it as a support and to prevent their being trimmed to death. The netting was very easy to use; just unfold it and hang it up! The trellis is proving strong enough to support the vines and the rectangular holes and the non-stretchy nature is better. It doesn't get tangled and the vines grow easily through it."
1,B-o-r-i-n-g,I am a true fan of the memoir but I read only half of this - and that took me days because it kept putting me to sleep. I can't even comment on anything because nothing happened.
1,ZERO,Our book club from Amarillo just finished discussing this book. We are seven women who grew up in Amarillo and attended Tascosa High School during the same era as Gail Caldwell. Her memoir is arrogant. Who wants to waste their time reading a list of books another person read?We graduated went to the University of Texas in Austin. We are glad to be back in Amarillo.We would have rated the book a zero of five stars if that was an option.
1,Disappointed in the prose,"I usually enjoy memoirs, particularly one written so well that it draws me into the writer's world (Mary Karr's The Liar's Club is one such book). This book, on the other hand, is NOT such a memoir:the writer kept me at arm's length and didn't give me a direct experience of her life. Most of it seemed like a summary or overview, not something that gave me any sense of her unique perspective. Caldwell didn't help me experience her world, even though I grew up in the same era of Vietnam, drugs, and nascent feminism. I read about half of it and quit."
4,Stunningly beautiful and powerful,"Gail Caldwell's account of her West Texas childhood is one of the most accurate and beautiful accounts of a place that seems to lie just beyond the imagination of the rest of America. I know it is absolutely perfect, down to the way sunlight looks in the gritty air. I know West Texas and this book just might be the best one ever to capture the place as it is. Highly recommended."
4,Brings Back Memories,"A Strong West Wind brought back many memories of growing up in Texas, early close relationship with my father and the quirky things happening in Austin in the 70s. I bonded with the author on many of the pages. Some of the references to the books she had read could have been left out."
1,Not a Very Good Person to Write a Memoir,"We read this book for out family book club, and we were all disappointed. The writer seemed bratty, shallow, self-centered and very full of her ability to choose a really obtuse word when a clearer one would do. We didn't like her and couldn't figure out why she was so depressed and depressing, other than perhaps her family history. I couldn't figure out how she was rebelling against her father, who seemed, as did her mohter, to support her in her every endeavor. She had a wonderful childhood and seemed to resent it. I would not recommend this book to anyone, and the only reason I did not burn it is that I think it is sacreligious to burn books. This one deserved it, though."
4,Good read,"Unlike the previous reviewer, this was my first read on the battle of Trafalgar. I found the description of the ships and the battle very detailed and could follow. I did however, have trouble following the events after the battle, particularly the storm. It would have been more helpful if the aurthors would have used more maps to show the positions of the various ships at various points. Although the events of the storm quite dramatic, the book seemed to lose its edge after the battle. Overall a good read and worth picking up."
3,It's okay,"I am so glad I did not rely solely on this book to study for the PRAXIS in Math and Writing. The math section is really good. I especially liked the CD because it gave me a feel for the real exam (I took the CPPST version). The ""cheat sheet"" was helpful because all the information needed was in one page. However, this book did not do it for me in the Writing section. The book did not cover a lot of areas found in the exam. If you really want to pass the PPST, you're better off buying Barron's How to Prepare for PRAXIS book. That book has more info and covers a lot more subjects. Other than that, I give Exam Cram 3 stars."
2,inadequate,"I don't think the author wrote practice questions based on actual praxis exams, many topics were not covered and many of the questions were not well thought out. The book came with a CD but the questions were very limited with some wrong answers. You would be much better off buying the Kaplan praxis book."
5,Perfect old school ballet barre work video,"The other reviewer is right (and thank you so much for writing such a great review). This is a perfect video for people who just want a basic, old-school barre session with no flash. Finis Jhung has a pleasant demeanor and gives helpful, down-to-earth instruction, reminding dancers to maintain correct form, not force turnout, stretch, reach, etc. The demo dancer is excellent and easy to follow. It's just hard enough for me (a returning, rusty 40-yo dancer (in decent shape) with many years of classes as a child and teen)... and it's basic enough, so you can really concentrate on balance, strength and flexibility-building and form. I just got my copy in the mail yesterday and did it on my new free-standing barre today -- am very happy with it. And very grateful to other reviewer who took the chance on ordering it and then recommending it, as I think a good barre video might be hard to find. Looking forward to working it for awhile and going to the next level!"
3,more info please,"cd book was ruined, cd was perfect. i like to look at the cd inserts that come with the music. please mention that in the future."
1,Green????,"I ordered these and it did not say a color so I ordered them assuming that they were clear. Wow to my surprise they are GREEN, really on a green bush. This is not a good product to buy because of the bad description."
2,not her best...,"I love reading Stella Cameron present day novels, but frankly am disappointed in her historicals. The dialogue is obscure, the characters slightly stilted. Stick with her books such as ""Pure Delights"" and ""Sheer Bliss""."
5,unusual find,"I came across this while browsing YouTube and was so taken decided to buy the whole set rather than download the excerpt posted online. Great music, great set, some real fancy picking, and satisfying bluegrass. Good listening. Really."
1,R134a Blue Cap -- NOT STANDARD SIZE,"This cap did not fit standard R134a Low Side service port on 2001 Ford truck. It was too large. Even though it was the same size as the High Side service port cap, it would not screw into place."
3,"Convenient, But Not All That Practical","The true hallmark of Tupperware's flat out line is the ability the collapse the container for storage, then adjust its size while in use. The angst is that this is a Tupperware item that you can not use to heat a food item in a microwave oven."
4,Great!,The tupperware is perfect for saving space!! but becareful when puting it in the cooler make sure it is not crushed or else food will come out because it can collapse. Other then that it is great!
5,Best book about the Old South,"My father is from Danville, VA where many of the Hairstons lived. Like the author, I am from Boston, but have always been fascinated by Southern history and specialized in it during college. This is an exceptional book that combines the best of responsible historical research and engaging journalism."
3,I can't really sum this book up until I have read fully...,"I was curious and overwhelmed to learn that a book was published based on my family name. I am a black decendent of Hairstons. I also find it compelling that a white author could dedicate his time and efforts toward researching the struggles and triumphs of one particular family. I was gripped by this book from the day I purchased it. From what I have read so far, the story is beautifully written. I have so much to learn about my heritage."
2,A story about a Southern family as told by a Yankee.,"A story about a Southern family in black and white -- mostly black from a Yankee point of view. page 16 The author asked the famous Jester Hairston how he felt about being in this house (Cooleemee) given its long history. Jester replied: ""It's a part of my ancestry and it's a part of me just as much as it's a part of Peter's. My folks were here in a different capacity but that was the way of life in those days. It's the way it came up. Why look at it with hate? If you hated every one who had us in slavery -- that was the system in those days. I don't know a better man than Peter."""
1,"Hairston, an american family in black and white",I was delivered 2 bootleg copies of this book. They are a different color on the cover and the pages from the original and are both missing the photo gallery. I am a Hairston and this angers me greatly. This deception from Amazon through their venders has put an end to my purchases from Amazon
2,inaccurate family trees,After seeing inaccuracy and a rather strange omission in the Oak Hill family tree and also inaccuracy in the Beaver Creek one I wonder at the accuracy of the book in general.
2,too long and boring,"ugh, I fell asleep at the theater when I saw this and when I watched it at home with my kids, it was just as bad. We were all bored out of our minds and these were teenage boys who were watching with me. I really thought they would dig the violence, but they said it was too much of the same thing over and over and the story was not good enough to keep their interests."
3,DO NOT BE FOOLED,Do not be fooled by the title...Though the music may be good....this has nothing to do with tribal house music....it is more along the lines of filtered disco samples and circuity sounds....This comes from someone in the dance music industry...hopefully that means i know what i am talking about...at least i hope it does....
4,Great book - worth the read!,"I found this book very practical and easy to read. Peter's own experiences and that of others have made this a valuable and useful tool. It certainly helped me in returning to my home country, and helped me understand some of the things that have happened since I've returned."
4,Great book part of literature and specifically Caribbean literature,"A good short narrative of being brought up in the Caribbean. Hodge's writing is beautiful and to the point. The multiplicity of motherhood in Cynthia's life rings true for many of us who are familiar with Caribbean culture and anyone who recognizes the all too familiar issues of self identification during one's early teens. It's a shame Crick, Crack is no longer in print, get a copy if you can!"
5,This album is Awesome!,"Wow, this album is off the chain. Probably the best 80's music I've ever heard. Billy Ocean is very underated, and this is definitely his best album. Every song is dynamite, and the production is fantastic. Buy the darn thing, its excellent feel good music and you won't be disappointed."
2,Walls Fall Down,"Tear Down These Walls was Billy Ocean's final run at chart success. The album features one of the most reviled songs from the 80's, ""Get Outta My Dreams, Get Into My Car"". It generally makes the list for worst songs from the 80's, but it is a little harsh as the song has a fun, innocent charm that seems to be missing from most songs these days. It made its way to number one and it was the last time Mr. Ocean had a top ten single. He became a casualty of the grunge movement in the early 90's as most 80's stars who were perceived to be soft met up with a similar chart demise."
4,"well,","this is a story all about how my life got flipped upside down. well just sit right there, I'd like to take a minute"
4,JVC XV-N322S DVD Player,"Excellent moderately priced DVD player. It plays most DVD's and CD's in today's world including DVD-R, and CD-R. It plays all without skipping, hesitation or freezing up. I was very impressed with it's ability to play badly scratched CD's that I couldn't get to play on any other player. Although designed primarily for NSTC use, it also plays some PAL format DVD's. I tried a couple on it. One worked, one did not. I have a feeling it was the DVD disc more than the player. Slimline and very compact. My only criticism of the player is that the case doesn't feel very solidly built. Instruction manual doesn't give much info. Could provide a bit more information about the player. Overall however, it is an excellent product and I would recommend it."
5,PAL,"I needed a DVD player to play my German DVDs (PAL), films that I copied from German TV. This player does a fine job at a decent price. Players like this are hard to find since Mintek who used to make players with a PAL feature cannot be found any more.Note: Anyone interested in this player, please do consider that if you want to play DVDs which you PURCHASED overseas additionally have inbedded ""Region 2"". You cannot play Region 2 on this or any other player in the USA."
2,I would pass on this one..,"I actually won this DVD player at a raffle event and it's a good thing I didn't pay for it. Cosmetically its great, its skinny, has cool blue illuminating lights and the remote is well laid out.The functionality is horrible. The buttons functions seem delayed. Often times it won't open or turn off without a 10-second wait. I've had trouble playing VCD's and burnt DVD's that have worked in far cheaper players. Also skips on dvds that work perfect in my computer dvd player."
2,Great cd if you just want the sounds but no words!,This is a great cd for background music. The cd has no songs actually sung though!
4,"Jive Records, to Millie, We Surrender!","When Millie Jackson signed with Jive Rcords they ATTEMPTED to clean up her image with her first 2 studio releases on Jive; An Imitation of Love, and even more with, The Tide is Turning. Needless to say they learned their lesson, and this live CD was the end result.Frankly I would have liked this release more if it had more tracks on it, but the combination of Millie's way underated singing, and her trademark blue tinged stage banter work.Throughout her career one of Millie's other trademarks is the way she can remake a song like nobody else, and the highlight of this release is her take on Carol King's ""Will You Love Me Tomorrow"".Back To The S&^T, is really Back To Millie."
3,Spin Toy,The toy is kind of cheap and did not last very long.if it is dropped breaks very easily. The good side is it did not cost much
4,Great Baby Toy,"Babies love to play with this, and it is very fun and duravble. My baby has abused this thing and it still works pretty much like new."
4,Great toy for a 5-10 month old,"We loved this toy. It was so good when Bella was learning to sit, because it's heavy and she could lean on it to balance. As she got bigger she learned how to press the button herself - so it's still popular 5 months later! Would highly recommend it."
4,Using for many years,I have been using Prosta-max tablets for over 15 years. I attribute my good prostrate health to its use. I also think the multi-vitamin aspect of this product to be excellent
5,Smooth Jazz at its BEST,"I bought this album after hearing brief samples of the music and it was worth every dime. Great smooth listening jazz, mostly instrumental. Very relaxing and soothing sounds. Good cuddle up with your special someone type of album. If you buy an album cold, this is it! Well worth the purchase!!"
2,Skipable.,"Around the World is one of my personal favorite Chili Pepper song, released as the second single to the smash hit Californication and in two parts--this being part one.It combines their rap and funk roots in the verse with a melodic and powerful chorus. The beginning is rough, and abrasive, pairing Flea's demanding slap-bass style of playing with John's funky and masterful guitar manipulation that generates an amazing and mind blowing intro lasting 30 seconds.It is the two b-sides that I'm not so fond of. ""Parallel Universe"" hasn't changed as much as you'd like it to. Really, if anything, it comes off less perfect then the actual album version.""Teatro Jam"" is a nice song that jams like crazy. Chad and Flea provide delectable rhythm, and John plays the guitar proficiently thought the entire thing. It's not bad. This single is purely for collectors, as the b-sides aren't the most valuable ones the Chili's have released. The title track is, hands down, the best off this single."
1,"Minimal value, for collector's only.","The ""Around the World"" single appeared in two parts, each backed with a pair of b-sides. This is part 1.The title track is a funky, driven piece, opening with a raging distorted bass run before blasting into an oddball, scratchy, funky verse. It's a decent tune, although it's on ""Californication"", so it's unlikely anyone would buy it for this.The b-sides on part 1 are from the Teatro sessions, demos worked up before the album-- ""Parallel Universe"" hadn't changed much-- the bass and guitar are separated (you can really hear the metallic edge in Flea's bassplaying) a bit more, but other than that, it's about the same thing. The ""Teatro Jam"" piece features a somewhat irritating guitar riff and some superb playing from Chad Smith and Flea, but truthfully, it's not all that listenable.In the end, this one is probably best for collector's only."
4,"An excellent album, sadly unnoticed","It's strange, and quite sad, that Chris Darrow, one of the most original US artists, had to find a record label in Germany to keep on recording. A founding member of Kaleidoscope, he was also part of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band in the late 60's and worked with Linda Ronstadt, surf champion/singer Corky Carroll, Kim Fowley and many other rock, folk and surf groups. ""Coyote/Straight from the heart"" is a superb double album, with one haunting instrumental CD, full of ""desert winds"" emotions, and the other containing several excellent and touching songs, very moving at times."
3,"Love the look, but............","I really love the look and style but it was to big. I used the measuring guide and ordered a size smaller than what was recommended, I could have gone a size or two smaller and been very happy.Other than that I am happy, the quality is good and the price was great, shipping was slow but it arrived in time for my party (other wise I would have sent it back for a smaller size)."
1,True Indigo Girls Fans will be Horrified,"I am a diehard Indigo Girls fan. I also enjoy instrumental guitar, etc. I thought I would enjoy this CD. Let's just say that this CD is to the Indigo Girls as John Tesh is to Metallica. These are ""elevator music"" versions of Indigo Girls songs and somehow, the musicians on this CD have managed to bleed every bit of complexity and feeling from the music of the Indigo Girls. This was a HORRIBLE CD! I thought I might put it in a yard sale, but decided some other poor true fan would be lured in as I was, so I decided to humanely destroy it by driving over it. If you love the passion of the Indigo Girls and their complex melodies as I do, stay FAR AWAY from this CD."
5,excellent small gift box,excellent small gift box - well made and makes the enclosed pendant look first class - look no further for a small gift box
5,Very Nice For the Money,"Some necklaces come with no gift box or one that is not that impressive. So, if you want to impress someone, this box looks very nice and presents any necklace pendant perfectly, so the receiver will surely be pleased."
1,Worse than terrible,"These kits are rotten, the results are terribly inaccurate. They say to wait 10 -20 minutes to get proper results tsting ammonia and nitrate and both tests just get darker and darker even in FRESH MIX SEA WATER with no opportunity for ammonia to be there.Never buy em again."
3,Great Voice in search of proper material,I will have to admit that I loved Michael Ball singing songs normally performed by female voices. But there are just some songs here that don't do his God Given voice justice. With one look is just a total let down.But on the whole I believe that this is a very good springboard album into getting into his TYPE of music.
4,wonderful voice and beautiful music,"A few pieces might be overly orchestrated, but as a whole this is simply wonderful. One of my favorites and I know the songs, love them, and Michael Ball's voice is the best male voice to listen too. Well worth purchasing"
2,Disappointing after seeing Michael in Webber Celebration,Michael Ball did a great performance in Andrew Lloyd Webber's Celebration. His performance of Love Changes Everything is usually very good. His voice has apparantly matured since this CD was made.
5,GREAT,"I HAVE THIS VIDEO AND THE MORE I WATCHED, THE BETTER IT BECAME, THE MOST BEAUITIFUL SONGS ARE FOUND AS EARLIER STATED ON THE OLDER CD'S, BUT AS A DEVOTED FAN, HE SINGS GREAT, GOOD TO WATCH AND THE SEXIEST GUY AROUND."
2,PLEASE!!,"oh please!! he sounds like a night club singer!! he should stick to singing ""les mis."" maybe i was expecting too much. he was fabulous singing in ""les mis."" i thought that he would have learned more after singing along-side Colm Wilkinson!!"
2,I just don't get it,"HOkey, over the top arrangements and 3rd rate lizard lounge singing... I don't care for most British musical theatre stars and while I like Michael Ball in certain things, he is absolutely awful in this recording."
2,Very disappointed,"I saw Michael for the first time on the Andrew Lloyd Webber Celebration and thought he was wonderful and wondered why we in USA have not heard about him. I purchased the CD even after reading the reviews. It was over orchestrated on many songs and I only liked three of them. I am not a person who buys many CD's so I felt I wasted my money and now understand why he remains at home. I do love ""Love Changes Everything"" and still think he was great on the show."
4,A good buy,"It took some time for me to warm up to this album, but I finally did. Mr. Ball is fantastic and sings with tremendous passion as usual. ""Anthem"" is particulary powerful. My only complaint is that the songs tend to be over-orchestrated and this is the reason for only 4 stars. If you are a musical or Michael Ball fan this is a good buy!"
5,Songs from world's best musicals!,"I have always loved MB's singing. This recording is one of the best ones i have heard. I think the selection of songs is very good and the arrigements are marvellous. I espectailly like songs, I Dreamd a Dream, Show Me and Losing My Mind. I listen this CD over and over again."
5,More than worth the money!,"If you buy only one CD this year, get Michael Ball's Musicals. He has the most incredible voice I've ever heard and his rendition of these songs is professional and over the top! Pay no attention to the 1-star critiques, they probably only listen to heavy metal and there's no accounting for taste! Michael is perfect in every way. I'd like to take him home with me, but I can't, so the CD will have to do. BRAVO, Michael!"
1,I have to go with the one-star people!,"I finally ordered this CD, after hesitating for months. All those great reviews convinced me. I wish now I had paid attention to the one-star reviews, because I agree with them, - I HATE THIS CD! It IS over-produced, he DOES sound like a lounge singer (Tom Jones comes to mind). All the things I love about Michael Ball's vocal styling are absent from this recording. He ruins ""With One Look"" and ""Don't Rain on my Parade"" is just embarrassing. If you love the Michael Ball from ""Aspects of Love"" and ""Les Mis"" you probably won't like this CD. I wish I had saved my money!"
1,What happened?,"After seeing the song selections on this cd, I thought this would be one of the best musical cd's on the market. Boy, was I wrong! His renditions of the songs are terrible (with exception to Anthem and Easy Terms). It seemed as if they were being sung by a lounge lizard. I could just picture Michael standing next to a piano, snapping his fingers, while singing. Do yourself a favor and skip this cd."
3,I was gonna get it..........,I was gonna buy the dvd combo pack but then i found out it's packed with the full screen 1 disc version of shrek which made me say no. I hate full screen movies. And i really wanted the special edition. so oh well. i'll prolly just rent Shrek-3D if it ever comes to rental stores.
1,Confusing...,"Considering that this disc lacks a Widescreen version of the film and the ""extras"" disc the original boasted, I would definitely not recommend buying this mess. Why do studios re-release DVDs with fewer features and in Full Screen only? The ""extras"" are part of why DVD is such a success. Furthermore, widescreen TVs are starting to penetrate the mainstream. In a few years High Definition widescreen TV will be a significant presence. Who will want Full Screen DVDs then?"
5,I love this movie!!!!!!!!!!!,"When I first saw the preview, this looked kind of stupid but then I went and saw Shrek with my boyfriend and neither of us stoped laughing through the whole thing (exept the end which is really sweet). teenagers will love this (I do) my little sister loves it and so do my parents. This is a great movie for all ages. BUY SHREK TODAY!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,"Now, I'm a believer","Shrek is packed full of gross out humor and voice talents of Cameron diaz, Eddie Murphy, Mike Myers and John Lithgow. The movie was well thought out and splendidly animated. Even though Shrek 2 was better, this movie had some great spoofs and a funny rendition of the Monkee's classic: 'I'm a believer' Smash Mouth doesn't do a bad job. The karaoke at the end is hilarious. Eddie Murphy as Donkey steals this show.Favorite line:Donkey: So where's this fire breathing pain in the neck anyway?Shrek: Inside, waiting for us to rescue herDonkey: I was talking about the dragon, ShrekA lot of the jokes young children may not get, but they'll enjoy the music and the characters.This movie will be funny for years to come. I look forward to watching it with my kids when they get older."
3,3-D is great but the movie dissapointed me,Shrek 3-d picks up from where shrek ended. The 3-d is great but the movie was just a 16 minute show. The original shrek is much better. It says that it will leave you laughing before shrek 2 begins. That is a lie! I think that you should spend your money on something else.
1,Lets watch half of the movie!,"I got this movie for my dad since its his favorite movie, but he said it won't play past half way through. It was guaranteed at over 90% but I don't even have 60% of the movie! I'm pretty bummed :("
3,Good Movie In 3D,Just watched Shrek in 3D. Better than in 2D but I'm not sure if it was worth the extra moneybeing I already had it in 2D. It had vary good depth but nothing that jumped out of thescreen like you would be looking for in a 3D movie. Buy it if you like 3D depth but don'tlook for any great out of screen surprise.
5,Great movie for kids and adults,"Shrek is a great movie overall. It has a cool plot and funny characters. It's basically a movie that parodies all the fairy tale [stuff] we read and watch in elementary school (like Cinderella, Snow White, the GingerBread man, the whole chivalrous thing with the princesses and knights).But the unlikely hero of this movie is a green ogre named Shrek. He's a huge, scary monster who lives alone in his swamp, guarding it from any intruders. But in this land where the movie is set there are lots of other fairy tale creatures.One strange animal is the Donkey, who knows how to talk. He's been rejected by his owner, and now he meets Shrek. What ensues is a hilarious and cute friendship that brings these two characters together to save the princess for the prince.This movie looks great and is all computer animated. They did a beautiful job making the scenes. The dialogue is witty and interesting.This is definitely a watch-again movie."
1,Shrek,I would love to review it but I still haven't gotten it. It's been six weeks and it's still not here. Not impressed with that part of Mars Movies. Got it the day after I wrote this. Still took longer than I would have liked.
1,man that sucked,"OK, I've not seen this movie. But JEEEEZZZZ the trailer sucked. Thanx for nothin'. Jump & jump hard."
1,omg,I hated this film I think it should go into the hall of shame. Yes it was funny in some parts but it was very annoying.
3,disappointments one after another with this movie,"I will not let my children watch this movie again. Enough said, poor judgment on Disney's behalf."
3,Watchable...but still,"I must say that I had been looking forward to it. Now I liked the Shrek character and seeing all those from the fairy tales. But still, too crude and not very origanl. Eddie Murphy's voice was annoying most of the time (Like watching Buddy Love).Although it's not for young kids, it's watchable."
1,This movie is NOT for kids!,"Someone got my son this movie as a Christmas gift last year (he was 3 at the time). I'm so glad I watched it first. Within the first 5 minutes I had decided that he would not see this movie now - and he would not see it 2 years from now either. The movie may have gotten great reviews, but I thought it was vulgar. It's certainly not what I want my child to see and then imitate. Not for kids younger than 10, in my opinion."
1,You have GOT to be kidding me!,"To start, he animation is good, and there are a few good visual jokes.But the plot is so thin, so contrived that it would not have filled out an episode of Power Rangers.Shrek is an ogre who only wants to be left alone. Lord Farquaad rounds up all the Fairy Tale Creatures in the land, and relocates them to Shrek's swamp, less than a mile away. Why? Apparently for absolutely no reason other than there is no movie if he doesn't. Farquaad says he will relocate them again (to where?) if Shrek will retreve the Princess he needs to marry to become a King. Only complication is that the Princess is under a curse (which seems to take the night off while Shrek and Donkey are talking by the light of the moon).(Adult) inunendo and toilet humor make this unsuitable for small children. Lack of characterization, plot or internal consistancy make it unsuitable for anyone else."
1,"If you like foolishness, this is for you...","I got this for my kids because everyone raved about how great it was. I was horrified that this movie was marketed for kids. It was crass and gross, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
2,violent,"I felt like this was incredibly way too violent and curse words, really?! It just wasn't necessary. Too much had to be assumed that beauty is on the inside and so obviously stating that outward appearance is what makes someone ugly or beautiful. The violence was shocking. Shrek is violent as his approach to get people away and so is Princess Fiona....the donkey was the only redeeming character in this movie"
4,Pleasent and entertaning,"this brings home a warm and fun fealing to those who veiw it.me and my whole family enjoyed this movie so much we had to watch it 4 times...this movie also shows the difference in being different at that its ok to be that way.I found it not only just a great and entertaining movie, but a great learning tool as well."
3,Finally a Kids Movie that works for me too....,"I have a 2 1/2 year old that enjoys this movie.....and for once (despite REPEATED viewings) ....I still enjoy a number of moments throughout the movie...I had an infrequent night to myself last week, and it was an internal debate between Shrek and the Matrix for my own viewing...LOL..That should at least say something about the enduring qualities of this film without going into well worn detail eh?"
4,Kid's love it.,This movie is cute and I love the digs on Disney and Fairy Tales. My kids can't stop watching it. I recommend it for 5 year olds up to adults.
3,"It WAS good, But not that great",Every body and their brother was on me to go get this movie...not for my son's but for me. And as a Mom of course I love the children's movie and watch some of them more than they do. But as far as this movie being as great as everyone yelled about....I didn't get it. Yes there is adult humor..and yes it was a funny movie. And it was good. But neither one of my son's sat the whole way through it. And if I would of been waiting for some thing really great to happen...i would of watch the whole thing either. I got a few giggles and felt left out at the end of it. What was the big deal...i'm lost...lol.
2,Don't believe the hype,"This movie was built up to be something it really is not and that is a kids movie. With all the bodily function jokes and sexual overtones I am surprised it got the rating it did and that people let their small children watch it. If it was billed differently, I might given it another star. It has a few good moments as a fairy tale about love and not judging the book by its cover. It has a refreshing ending but it most certainly does not live up to the hype."
4,Foul language is not for kids,I would have loved this movie if it weren't for the occasional bad words and adult humor. I don't know why it was put in the movie. Adults have plenty of that in every other movie.
3,Mixed Emotions,"I thought Shrek was technically excellent. The animation is well crafted. Mike Meyer's and Cameron Diaz were fine but Eddie Murphy was a bit too slick and drew attention to himself so that I felt at times that I was listening to a Murphy stand-up routine rather than the donkey character. The ""bathroom"" jokes & gross-out antics seem to be an integral part of today's Hollywood comedy. Do we really need trash culture invading our animated features?Needless to say I'm disappointed, not so much at what Shrek is but at what it could have been."
4,mixed message,"I loved the film and it's great for all ages, but I have to pick a bone with the mixed message. The message is that looks don't count, and then poor Lord Farquaad is barraged with crude, old, and non funny ""short"" jokes. SPOILER ALERT AHEAD: Ok, then the Princess Fiona/Shrek love story moral is that looks don't count. Well, when she is supposed to be ""beautiful"" she has a body that doesn't happen to mortals without extensive plastic surgery (typical tiny waist massive breasts). Then when she turns ""ugly"" she gets a nice, ripe and ATTRACTIVE figure that mirrors most of America and the donkey cruelly shrieks, ""YOU ATE PRINCESS FIONA"". So the message is that fat people are ugly, but it doesn't matter because they have inner beauty? And just who is going to be the doll? Why, of course, it's the ""beautiful"" Fiona."
3,"Not bad, but drags itself (intentionally) into the mud.","The best part of this film is Princess Fiona, which is not only one of the best animated characters in years, but also flawlessly captures Cameron Diaz' incredible repertoire of cute facial expressions. Wow. Worth the price of admission on her own.The worst part is easy: the toilet humor. The film could easily have been bumped up a star or two without it.I find it odd that some parents can wring their hands over the word ""damn"", but have no compunctions at all about their kids being exposed to the continual (and disgusting) bodily-function/fluid ""humor"". And conversely, I also find it ironic that some folks would use the word ""wholesome"" in any sentence related to this film; it's nothing remotely of the sort.It's an ok and entertaining film overall, but it would be better if Dreamworks realized there are other laughs you can earn besides cheap ones, and there are other ways to do it besides wallowing in scatology."
2,Let down by this one!,"I feel conned! The 3D effect seems to only work if; you have an TV set with outstanding color beam allignment, you don't wear spectacles or contacts, you have no astigmatism, you have a DVI or SCART connection from your DVD player to your TV or home theatre amplifier, you close the blinds or drapes and switch off all the lights, and you spend 15 minutes waiting for the chromophores in your eye to get used to the 2 cent cardboard cut-out 3D spectacles. I recommend that you first rent it before buying."
5,A Joy,"This is a terrific movie to watch when life seems tough and you're feeling sorry for yourself. Have some laughs and forget your problems. I also like the film's basic messages. First, that looks aren't everything. Second, that life really hands you some twists and turns you weren't expecting. Smart people roll with the punches and make lemonade from the lemons."
5,loads of fun,"A fun and funny movie, Shrek delivers us with good fun! This movie is a great family movie ... Entertaining and smart is what 2 say about this movie. The characters in this movie is so funny. Can be a little disgusting at times but- hey, that's half the fun! The DVD is loaded with lots of extras. The movie is great and it's on a great DVD!Shrek is a ogre that everyone's afraid of. He ends up meeting a talking donkey with a sense of humor who follows him on a journey 2 try and save a fiesty, knows how to kick some butt, princess 2 get his swamp(home, privacy) back. But on the quest he finds out a little secret about the princess that's well- funny!Great family entertainment. Loads of fun! Loads of laughs! It's a good one from Dreamworks!***** (5 stars)"
3,Overdone cartoon,"I probably would have given this 4 stars on its merit, but I was severly disappointed by Dreamwork's animation here. Here they totally missed the mark--even a computer animated cartoon should be a cartoon. Lord Farquar for example is maddenly realistic and yet not at all realistic.Look at Snow white's innocense and the simplicity of its animation. Take Pinocchio and the water scenes that you believe because they're not too real. Dreamworks tries too hard to make things look real and limits your imagination.There were great comical moments, but they have done much better story-lines in the past. It's definately a worthwhile movie and I don't regret buying it, but it will never be a top ten for me."
2,Mildly Entertaining/ Not for young kids,"With a talking mule as one of the main characters, be prepared for a lot of wordplay with the word ""ass"". Adults might want to view the movie before deciding whether they want younger viewers exposed to Shrek."
4,"Shrek, The Movie Only Thank You","When I buy a DVD that's just loaded with extras, I get excited. I think everyone does. Behind the scene outtakes, interviews, how everything's done...Interesting.While Shrek was a really good movie (one of few I can watch with my neice and nephew), the extras just plain stink. I spend half the time selecting the wrong thing, can't get out of the menu, and the ""trivia"" has to be read. There's no real ""extras"" on this DVD. Unless you want to talk to the screen, press a button, and get an answer. I've got an 8 BALL for that, thanks."
5,GREAT,best i've seen since i was nee high to a grass-hopper. if i didn't know better i would think it produced by warner bro. and not dreamworks.......
4,Exciting Movie for Kids and Adults,"We always try to find movies for the kids that they like and don't leave the adults bored. This movie is full of fantastic action. Hats off to the writers of ""Shrek"". Shrek reminds me of Herman Munster with his strength, and Shrek is full of courage.The movie is funny and has action that will put you on the edge of your seat. I will give no story details - check it out (especially if you want to watch a movie with your kids)."
4,Pretty good,My dentist was showing this film as he did root canal work on me and even at that I was laughing out loud - what more can I say?
3,Magical?,"I really liked this movie in the theater, but when it came out on DVD I found that the movie felt dated and no longer as funny as it was! I still enjoy it though! Especially Donkey! However,this DVD is the bane of my DVD collection! If you want to enjoy any of the special features, you better know which disc you want. It is annoying to have to keep switching from disc to disc just to see all of them. I Think that this is one of the worst and most overrated DVD's to come out in recent years (see Harry Potter for another one!) The movie is ok, the DVD stinks! My suggestion: if you liked the movie, get the DVD, but be prepaired to be really annoyed!"
1,Shrek DVD,"There is not much of a review for this DVD, received it put in our player it did not work. for the price i paid, i just did not bother to send itback."
5,Hilarious!,"When my parents and I saw this, we just cracked up! Eddie Murphy did an excellent voice-over for Donkey. I reccemend this to anyone who has a good sense of humor."
4,Very well put together.,"I really enjoyed Shrek. Shrek himself was pretty funny and Donkey was histerical. Fiona wasn't supposed to be TOO funny, and Farquad being short got old after a while. But all in all it was a funny movie, worth seeing over and over."
2,Apparently I'm one of only 10 people who didn't like Shrek,"But there it is. I hadn't seen it at the theatres and was looking forward to watching it with my son on DVD. Imagine my dismay as I kept waiting for the movie to get better and it never did.I didn't think it was funny but then again, I will own up to the fact that I don't find jokes about bodily functions to be funny and haven't since 3rd grade. I didn't even think it was very original.IMO, Monsters Inc. did a much better job with the genre and was funnier and much more original."
2,"Original, but not for the whole family.","I definately, think that this movie is funny, original and great, but despite that its not for the whole family. There are references and jokes in there that shouldn't be heard by younger children, this movie is best for older children, teens, and adults. This is not a young children's movie because it includes crude humour and mild profanities."
2,Don't Believe The Hype,This movie has to be one of the most overated movie's ever .Like someone pointed out earlier Myers Diaz Lithgow and Murray were just doing the same charecter from other movies (Especially Murray heck i have seen the same sidekick thing in a dozen disney movies over the last 10 years ).I know making pop culture references is funny to most people but I myself think it's cheap jokes along with all the cheap fart and poop jokes .I came into this movie thinking I would see a great movie as I had been told by masses boy was I wrong .The only reason this gets 2 stars is because of all the extra specials features
5,Cute Little Donkey,"I love this movie because of the adorable little donkey. He is so cute! He is obnoxious, yet adorable and friendly. He is also the most underrated character in the movie. Shrek and Fiona would not have been anywhere without all Donkey's loving, sweet help. I say let's band together and give Donkey the respect he deserves."
5,"Once upon a time, there was a movie for little boys and girls...","And all their parents loved it, and the hero was a gross big old ogre who lit his earwax candles on fire and the heroine was a skinny pretty princess of a girl who... well, if anyone hasn't actually seen it, I'll try not to spoil it. It's got it all. Young boys will identify with Shrek. Young girls will identify with Fiona. Everyone will groan at Donkey. Adults of all stripes will be impressed at the deftness with which adult and children's comedy is mixed into a family movie that isn't a sugar and syrup mess... this is witty, sharp, romantic, and goofy. Really, really impressive."
2,Shrek . . . for kids?,"Hmmmm . . . I get just about any video that comes out for my 3 and 7 yr old. Shrek looked like just another video. Well, it certainly isn't Disney. Most parents expect a certain consistency in animated flicks. Dream Works is is looking for a piece of he giant pie. The up side to this video - Incredible graphics. A little shocking really, from all the other 'kids' videos out there. Obviously they tried to appeal more to adults. The down side to the video - there is a lot of 'toilette' humor and innuendos that are inappropriate for most children. Little songs that seemingly are about to end rhyming in words that most parents wouldn't allow their kids to say and at the last moment changing the words. The princess singing a duet with a bird (cute), but them the bird explodes and she cooks her eggs. My suggestion is that parents should maybe preview this one themselves before showing it to young children."
1,3D does not work on television.Save your money.,"After watching this travesty on TV for 5 minutes,I turned it off and rested my aching eyes from the often out of focus 3D.I read that for 3D to work,a cinema must have a specially coated screen so television viewing is out of the question.This DVD does have a normal 2D version that kids can watch,but as the weak story is just an excuse for 3D effects,it isn't worth the money.It is only 15 minutes long and doesn't really add anything to the story. If you already have the first Shrek movie,then save your money and don't buy this."
2,What a letdown,"Of course, Shrek is a great movie but I bought this thinking that the Shrek 3D was going to be a great addition to our collection - I was completely letdown. Shrek 3D is 16 minutes long - my daughter was very upset when it ended so abruptly. If you already own the origianl Shrek, DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!"
5,Absolutely Fantastic,"This is one of the most visually exciting, well written opuses I have. I highly recommend checking out all of the extras on the DVDs also.This is generally not my type of movie, but I hope that their plans for a Shrek sequel will come to fruition. I will be one of the first in line to make sure that I get a copy. My hopes will be that it lives up to the excellence of this original."
5,A true FAMILY movie!,"I am a 32yr old father who was dragged to see this cartoon by my wife and kids. This movie comes on with the typical fairy tale narrated scene, then BAAM! Shrek (Mike Myers) takes over with his witty cracks. Eddie Murphy gives a great performance as the donkey that never shuts up (if you can be that funny, why)? The Princess (Cameron Diaz) gives spunk to an old fashion character. Shrek had me laughing louder than anyone in the theater. The Disney shots are great. A classic story line with new-age comedy."
5,Love this DVD!,I work with kid and this is the only DVD they all watch and love! I would highly recommend any parent or anyone to buy this DVD! I bought it used and it works just fine!
3,Not bad for an outdated medium,"You can't find many with a VHS player connected to their flat screen mounted TV. But if you do, this would make a great gift. Unless they subscribe to cable or movie content over the Internet, in which case they surely have access."
4,Great movie.,"Even though much of the humor is over their heads, it is appropriate for young kids and is something the whole family can watch together."
4,Decent film,"Out of the first three Shrek movies, I have to say that this is the best. It's a fairly funny movie with a lot of great lines, though there were a couple of inappropriate (and in an entirely unneccessary way) jokes, but this movie has a nice mix of medievalism/fairy tales and modern-day comedy and attitudes.One thing that bothers me is that the curse is never explained. WHY was Princess Fiona placed under the curse? I mean, did her parents make some evil fairy godmother or witch angry? The movie was good and I've seen it a couple of times, but that question has always nagged at me."
4,Good Movie,First time I have watched it. It was a good movie that was pretty funny. The PG rating is appropriate and you need to make a good judgement for your children.
4,good,somewhat unsuitable for kids younger than 13ok moviewsomewhat unsuitable for kids younger than 13ok movieShrek 2
5,You'll Laugh Out Loud!,"Shrek was hilarious! There was so much comedy, and the story was so entertaining. The characters were memorable, and each had something to offer. For example, Shrek offered his loner personality, and yet, showed feelings for the brave and independant Princess Fiona. Donkey is yet another comical character that deserves a lot of credit! I think he is the best character I've ever seen Eddie Murphy play. Even my parents thought this movie was funny, which shows that it's not childish humor. The setting of the movie was interesting and original, too: A medieval fairy-tale land.Overall, I would say this is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen! I recommend it to anyone looking for a good laugh, but parents who don't approve of ""potty humor"" might find it to be crude. Like I said, though, I think it's hilarious, and worth a watch."
2,Not a child's movie,"I have to say that I enjoyed this movie, so did my husband. However I would not show it to it's target audience. There were some things that I would not let children see.Several areas of language, either used in joking, and covered up by a rhyming word, or ""donkey"" jokes.One scene that made me gasp, when I thought about the kids seeing it was when the prince looked under the covers while pondering his princess! I couldn't believe that that was in a movie, where the majority of the audience is under 13!Enough said, but I would caution parents preview this before allowing your children to see it."
4,"Funny movie to watch, if you are bored or something","Good movie, not the best, but worth watching anyhoo."
5,Happily Ever After...,"This movie had enough love to make boys' skin crawl, enjoy fighting to make girls' turn their head and enough to make adults fall out of their chair. There were quite a few jokes that would go over a kid's head, aside puns or poking fun at another movie scene. Even though it has some mush it's great for all audiences and it does make a good point that I think will miss too many people."
1,A terrific movie for kids of all ages,"Once upon a time, there lived an ogre named Shrek (Mike Meyers). Shrek liked the quiet life in his swamp, until Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow)evicted all of the fairy tale animals from his Kingdom. The animals move into Shrek's swamp, which he is not happy about. So he and the fast-talking Donkey (Eddie Murphy) visit Farquaad to work out a deal: Shrek will rescue Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) from a fire-breathing dragon, in exchange for taking the animals back. While spoofing every fairy tale from Three Blind Mice to Three Little Pigs, and taking numerous shots at Disney, Shrek's message is not lost. One cannot always see beauty from the outside. I haven't seen a movie this funny in years. Bring the kids! I'd say 4 and up. There is some mildly crude humor, but little ones won't get it anyway."
1,Shrek,I have attempted to purchase this item twice from to seprate vendors and have not received either.
3,entertaining,"I'm not a big fan of Mike Meyers films at all, so I was going into this movie expecting a really horrible movie. Then it turned out to be an entertaining film that made me laugh at times. A good way to spend a few hours watching a movie!"
1,I Wanted to Cry . . .,"(warning: no spellcheck used.)This movie would have been OK except for the donkey.He was the only character with a modern day ""lowerclass black american"" accent.He incidentally was lazy, stupid and greedy as well. I'm not a psychologist, but this made me feel really bad. I went with a friend, and he felt uncomfortable, too.It's become acceptable to associate negative traits with certain dialects. For instance an ""appalachian"" or deep southern accent with ignorance and baseness.My review is not going to change anything; but I hope that people with children teach their little ones to judge people based on their actions, character and intellect--instead of making assumptions based on the way they speak.Thanks,Joanne"
3,Overrated,"This is a mildly entertaining flick that was released to capitalize on the newest animation technology. The story really drags and Mike Meyers' Scottish accent starts to grate on the nerves after about 15 minutes. John Lithgow, on the other hand, is hilarious with his deadpan delivery. The funniest scene in the movie is between Lithgow's Prince Fahrquod and the Gingerbread Man. Skip to that scene and you've seen all there is to see."
2,not as good,"I went to see this movie when it first came out and I was very disappointed!!!! I just bought the DVD and it had a few extras that were neat, But I was still disappointed with the movie. I only bought it becasue my kids loved it. I believe Monsters, Inc will be much better being it a Disney/Pixar movie!!"
5,Should be four stars,This is a good animated Film and the in my opinion the best animated movie of all time Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy Are Are almost at their best Behind Austin Powers And the Nutty Profeser so this was the third best Movie of 2001 behind Lord of the rings Fellowship of the ring and Harry Potter and the Sorcerest's Stone. So Buy it today.
3,I love shrek!!!,The movie could not be changed of course. It is a VHS of shrek. The one negative is there was not jacket? I didn't know that? But I am happy with my movie!
4,Very good children's movie,"The animation is incredible, and the DVD is filled with some interesting extras, including an engaging director's commentary, and a technical making-of documentary."
2,Not for the whole family,"My husband and I agree -- this movie is not for the whole family! This is one of those cartoons (like the Simpsons) that is just not for kids. It is very crude. I gave it two stars because it did have a few funny parts, but I won't be seeing it again and I certainly won't let my son see it."
5,LOVED IT!,"Great for young and old, original, funny, and just a greatanimated movie! Watch it, you'll love it too!"
4,Twists up the conventional ideas of fairy tales,"Shrek is a neo-classical funny movie, and mostly holds to form with the usual gag humor about body odor, some fresh updated parodies to reflect current pop culture, and a bit of sentimental moments about love's awkwardness thrown in.It twists usual generic fairy tales by portray the hero as a green ogre, and its sidekick as a brash donkey - the modern shape of knights in shining armor - and runs away with the story from there.Though I preferred the second movie for its stronger surprises and twists and turns, the first Shrek holds quite a bit of charm that child and adult both can enjoy."
3,a tasty onion of a movie,"What is there left to say about Shrek that has not been said? Who knows? My own feelings on the movie are like an onion.First, I love Mike Myers as Shrek. He is a disagreeable yet lovable hero. From the opening shower seen to the closing song, this movie is dependent upon Myers as the lead--and he does not falter.As for Murphy and Diaz, this is the best movie from either of them in a long while. The eagerness of the Donkey fits nicely with Murphy's talents. Diaz does pretty well as the straight man (straight princess I guess).The true joy for me in Shrek were the (fractured) fairy tale references and the subtle (and not-so-subtle) digs at Disney. In particular the scene where Shrek and Donkey arrive in Lord Farquaad's realm cracks me up. The photo is priceless.Enough of my rambling though. Shrek is a funny, funny movie. If you haven't seen it--I suggest you do so. I know I'll be watching this one again.I give Shrek my heartfelt recommendation."
5,Great Movie,I think I laughed harder and louder than my son when we went to see this movie at the theater. I couldn't wait for it to come out on tape. I've lent it to everyone I know who hasn't seen it and so far everyone loves it!
2,How much toilet humor can you stand?,"I expected this film to be clever and witty, more like Toy Story or Antz. I don't see the difference between this and many of the weak comedy entries this year. This felt like a studio trying to break in to the smart funny Pixar world, and failing. After Prince of Egypt I expected something classier and better quality than this dreck. I can't believe this was the highest grossing movie of the year. And even worse- critics have given it high marks! I just don't get it."
2,Ummm......Hmmm.....,"I don't see why everybody thought this was such a great accomplishment! It really was not very good at all. It sort of twisted on and on only to reveal a very predictable ending. A real dissapointmet.If you want to see something good, see monsters inc. It is definately worth seeing."
5,"An ""adult"" cartoon...","This is not really a cartoon per say, but an animated movie. I was basically dragged into watching it by a friend of mine. When he told me he bought a ""Shrek"" DVD, I laughed at him. Needless to say, when I watched it with him, I went and bought one for myself. It became my instant favorite. I have watched it so many times, I probably know every single word, and still, whenever it plays on TV, I immediately switch to that channel. Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy are the best!"
2,FULL SCREEN WHY????,Thank You Amazon for having such great real time reviews for me to read!!!!! I usually check here to see what to rent and what to buy. I am so glad I checked here first. I was going to buy this 2 DVD set. Saved again by Amazon reviewers.1) Full Screen - Not for me2) 3D - Not really 3D _thanks to the other reviewers for teaching me about real 3D DVDs.
1,shrek dvd 3-d bundle pack,"lame. i imagine most people buying this already have shrek at home, so that would mean most buyers would be purchasing this for the new material. 16 minutes for $20 is pathetic. i feel dumber than a donkey for buying this. instead of ""adventure"" on the packaging, it should say ""new short feature"". oh, have fun explaining to your kids, all excited and ready with glasses, that yes, that's all, there's no more. it was great having them look at me, confused about the ""movie"" ending so early."
3,"Great Movie, but DVD falls short of its promise","I waited for one month in great expectation of the DVD verson of Shrek. There were games and other cool features on this two disk set that I couldn't wait to tear into. Looks like lots of fun, right? Pretty disapointing. The cool games won't run off the DVD player on your TV. You have to have a PC running Windows 98, an internet connection and a DVD rom. We all have internet connection with our computers, and most of us have CD- roms on our computers. But I doubt that all the people who buy this DVD will have computers with DVD players. And while I have one that does, it's a Mac. No good.On the other hand, there's still a lot to enjoy on the DVD verson. There are two versons of the movie(formatted and widescreen) behind the scenes footage, and other interesting stuff. I really haven't looked at everything yet, and while it's worth the price, it doesn't deliver on the interactive games. Guess I got burned . . . I'll know better next time."
5,Great refreshing fun!,"What a great, refreshing movie this is! I was so pleasantly surprised with it. I think what I like most about it is that it does not take itself too seriously and pokes fun at other movies in this similar genre (such as Disney movies). It really is a hoot and great entertainment. This film is not really for kids, more like young adults and adults young at heart. I found it much more fun than anything by Disney or Pixar.The DVD presentation is wonderful and the DTS soundtrack is so involving it practically tickles your ears!"
5,Who could resist this Ogre,I sure could not. Shrek keeps you entertained from the moment you start to the moment you end. Another great series for family entertainment
5,A great movie for kids,"Mike Myers is the voice of Shrek, a nice ogre. It sounds like a very scary movie, but it really is a very nice movie. It fits fairy tale characters into the story along the way too. This is a very good movie. Boys and girls age 5 and up will love Shrek. There is only one violent part when Shrek is battling the knight. Shrek has a nice ending and some hilarious parts, so buy Shrek when it comes out on video and DVD."
1,What's wrong with people?,"I can't tell you how many people have told me this is a great movie. How much milege can we get from cliches and then the ridicule of cliches. True love? The music doesn't fit at all, (Hey now your an all star... in the opening credits, come on.)Mike Myers with an inconsistent Scottish accent which he already sold us in Austin Powers.It also is prejudiced against short people. All the DVD extras can't hide the fact that this is an insulting movie for adults and kids. Hollwood has finally killed all sense of taste and originality. I'll take disney (minus the musical numbers) any day."
1,It's a shame so many kids have already seen this.,"I don't own this dvd. My little brother borrowed it from a friend, and I watched it with him and my other little brothers. I know I shouldn't be reviewing, since I don't own this, but watching it made me so mad, and I want you to know why. I'm upset because the movie uses dirty jokes to be funny and claims to be a kids' film. Sometimes dirty jokes can be funny, I know that, but when you're a little kid you don't know what they mean or why they're funny. After one punchline one of my brothers turned around as if to ask me what it meant. That made me sick. It makes me sick how people make movies they say are for kids and then put dirty, even mean, material in them. Don't moviemakers know how sensitive and easily influenced kids are? I'm a 21-year-old college guy and know better!"
3,"Good DVD offering, OK movie","As the title of this review suggests, I wasn't overly impressed by the movie - it's cute, but unsophisticated (as in the plot, not the special effects). The animation effects are outstanding though! The DVD as a whole is brilliant with all kinds of cool features. I think I enjoyed them more than the movie!"
3,"Didn't care for some of the humor, voices & animation great","I guess I'd give this movie 3 1/2 stars if I could, some of the humor would be a little too adult for small kids and I didn't care for some of it either. I did like most of the characters and their voices, Shrek was one of the best. The computer animation was fantastic, much better than Final Fantasy, I thought you could almost think the characters were people in rubber suits. I think that I read the animators gave the people a little less than realistic movement in order to preserve the cartoon aspect, that seemed evident at times. The plot was predictable but then most movies since the beginning have been."
5,AWESOME,"this is an awesome movie with lots of laughs. it's great because they don't swear in it, but they do fit in ""inside jokes"" for the older kids in your family. A 17-year old and a 6-year old can enjoy this movie together! I loved it so much"
5,great stuff,"I don't know why I didn't see this movie when it came out in the theatre, but it was a big mistake. Even if the character animation isn't as good as Pixar's. The story was much better! The second DVD is also worth the price. For me the technical part was the most interresting but everything else was really entertaining and fun.I can't wait to see the next one."
2,Not suitable!,"Shrek, has it's good points but it is completely not suitable for children, there are noticable sexual jokes throughout the entire movie. I saw it with my 8 year old neice, and believe me, she knew what they where talking about, and the reason that she does is because she has seen it on TV. It's sad when you can't take a young child to a supposedly family friendly movie, because it is too inapropriate. Shrek didn't need to throw in adult humour to satisfy the parents, it would have been a completely enjoyable movie with out those kind of jokes."
2,I didn't like this one.,"I don't know what about it, but I really didn't like this movie. I just hated it. And i usually like these cute little movies, like Chicken Run, but Shrek just sucked."
1,NOT FOR KIDS,"Shrek may well appeal to some adult's tastes but it is certainly NOT an appropriate movie for kids, for many reasons! There is humor and some really frightening, even sick, violence. It distresses me that it is marketed to children. My advice for parents is to rent and view before you show your kids."
2,Dead Ducks Claim Bankruptcy,"In Antarctica today we experienced the life and times of a frozen solid chicken. The chicken seemed to be having a hard time breathing because of unknown reasons. It also seemed to have a serious case of dandriff because of the flakes of skin that flew ofF when we accindentally slipped when cutting the ice from around him. The Antarctic weather must have been hard on him because when we finally got him free from the ice, he was in very small chunks."
3,The first Shrek film from Dreamworks.,"Shrek (voice of Michael Myers) is a cool digitally-animated film, but I do not like the Eddie Murphy donkey. Too annoying. It ruins the love story. A talking Irish horse would have been better. I like the ""Hidden Mickey"" with the fried eggs. This is not a Disney film. It is a Dreamworks film.Kathleen Freeman (Jerry Lewis movies) did the voice of the ""Old Woman"" before she passed away in 2001.Followed by:Shrek 3-D (2003) aka Shrek 4D Adventure is an attraction at Universal Studios Theme Parks (3-D glasses included).Shrek 2 (2004).Shrek the Third (2007).Shrek the Halls was broadcast on ABC television Network, November 28, 2007.SHREK FOREVER AFTER (2010).Scared Shrekless was broadcast on NBC television network, October 28, 2010.Puss in Boots (2011)."
2,Sickening,"Jokes about penis size, erectins, oral sex, and rape come into play strongly in this ""Children's"" film.Completely innapropriate. Check this. Shrek and Donkey (that's his name, I'm serious, I guess the makers were to lazy to give him a name) arrive at the prince's castle, which is huge. They look at it, and then Shrek sais ""Do you think he's comfensating for something?"" (penis size joke). Later, Donkey tells Princess that Shrek said that, and then sais ""But I think what he's really trying to say is,"" and is stopped by Shrek. My five year old daughter asked curiously ""What's he talking about, mommy?"" I prentended not to know.I'm under the name..., because I don't want my E-Mail address seen."
1,not impressive,"While the hype was high about this movie based on the comments from my kids, friends etc., I found the movie to be pure pedestrian drivel. Snippets of fairy tales, music that gen Xer's can identify with does not make a movie creative in the least. Would I watch this again -- NO! I believe that the Toy story movie in comparison was far superior."
1,Everyone WAKE UP !,"I saw Shrek and I cant put into words how much I hated it,the only good part in the movie is when it FINALLY ends,I do recomend this movie to people who have trouble sleeping cause this movie will help you get that needed rest,I wish I would have brought a pillow when I went and saw it,this movie wasso bad I had to rush home and take a shower after watching itcause IT STINKS ,period ."
2,Trite,"Very good production values, very poor human values.Not so much childlike, but sophomoric. Personally am sorry I bought it for my child. Cutesy, not be bought or even borrowed."
2,Shove the moral right down my throat....,"While most people seem to like this movie, I found it to be much of a dud for myself. The movie starts out great with many funny moments. However, after the princess is saved, the movie just seems to drag. Then comes the movie's moral: ""don't judge by appearances."" It's nice and all, but it seemed to get shoved at you during every turn. This is a movie I would show kids, but for adults it could go either way (love/hate). The animation and acting was great; the story needed help."
1,Not appropriate,"The movie's adertisements make it look like a kid's movie, and at first it seems it is. But if you re-watch it you'll discover it is amazingly crude, twisted, and sexual. ...The movies also packs WAY to many bodily function jokes in there. There's about five in the first three minutes alone. Shrek takes a bath in mud, gargles it, then jumps in a lake, farts, and a dead fish comes floating up. After that, he squeezes bug juice onto a stick and brushes his teeth with. Then he pulls out his own ear wax to make a candle, and drinks a martini with a human eye in it. Nice for children, huh?Well that's it. The warning to not let your kids touch this movies, much less watch it. ..."
1,a great example of wonderful talent put to waste,"shrek....... what garbage. i had heard from a friend who had went to see it that it wasn't very funny, but i decided to rent it, just to see. she was dead on. a lack of humor plagues this movie, and really crushes the great talent behind it (meyers, murphey, and diaz.) There was 1!!! funny scene in this movie, where the gingerbread man cookie says eat me. Otherwise, this movie included a lot eye-rolling. Regardless, its a good story, and an original idea, just one that was very poorly made. This seems to be one of those movies where people are just laughing because other people who don't know what funny is, are. And because of this, they are making a sequel, which is unfortunate, unless they fix this up. ..."
2,So-So,The animation is pretty good but the whole movie never really impressed me beyond that. I think of the children's movies I grew up with and feel sorry for this generation of children that a movie experience is comprised of worn out gags and a hodge podge of popular music. Let your kids see Bambi or Fantasia instead.
4,Very funny adult-themed movie...,"A great movie with clever writting, and a sarcastic tone. It works quite well. Not a Disney-esqe film, by any stretch. Please don't go into the theatre expecting that.I brought my 3 year old son to watch it, and all during the movie, I felt a little uneasy about exposing him to some things in it. The donkey curses one or two times, and Shrek says ""Jack***"" a couple of times, played for laughs. A fairly large amount of ""bloodless"" violence is also involved.Face it, this is a PG film, and parents should heed the rating. Watch it first without the kids. If you want to show them after you screen it, believe me, you won't mind sitting through it again."
5,Shrek is the bomb,Awesome! A must see. I have not laughed so much in years. Great for all ages! Performances and animation were brilliantly done.Oh.....just go see it for yourself. You won't be disappointed.
3,Buyer beware! Good movie - shady packaging,"I loved the movie Shrek, and the bonus 3D featurette is nice, but because of the way the disks are packaged, I didn't find out until too late that the feature is NOT in letterboxed format. With a movie as visually interesting as this, it is not worth losing so much movie for an O.K. 3D short.Buy the widescreen version instead."
5,SHREK,"GREAT MOVIE dreamworks has done it againkids will love it and adult,s who like great annimation will to"
1,The Emperors new clothes ??,"PLEASE watch this movie for what it is. Nice computer graphics. The voice acting is atrocious. The jokes thin and meaningless.The CGI is polish, and the old saying 'you can't polish a turd' is true in this case. Although the vast majority of people have been 'taken in' by the bright shiny CGI and have not been tempted to look behind the proverbial curtain. If they did they would see an extremely lacking movie. Mike Myers tired 'Scotsman' act, and Diaz must have phoned her part in. The only redeeming part was Murphy.Shrek ? more like Drek."
3,The Same Old Thing,"Shrek, I mean the actors worked hard and well, but give me a break. This movie was a little bit more for 6-year olds and sort of weird. So anyway, how scary can it get! Fairy tales have separate movies, and all they did was put them together!So if you see the movie once, you'll be pretty impressed. But after that,you'll see it my way."
2,Okay- once!,"This movie is like a fairy tale, with some unexpected twists. But after you watch this movie 2 or 3 times, it gets boring!"
2,Dreamworks still NOT Pixar's equal,"I am not a person who likes to complain, but this film is too OVERRATED! It is not that funny by any measure (I personally don't think it's funny at all) and it's DEFINITELY not inspired...the plot is scattershot beyond any reason or good sense. Even Mike Myers of whom I am a fan seems to be going through the motions without much inspiration.For such technology-heavy projects it should perhaps not come as a surprise that the plot is not the main focus, but after watching the 5-star TOY STORY 2,one cannot be satisfied with Shrek.I'd be disappointed if an adult considered Shrek's humour top class; he obviously has not discovered the Monty Python magic."
1,Arggh,"SERIOUSLY! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! With the confusing adult humor and gross crude scenes (at times--didn't you think the scene with the lord watching the mirror in his room was a little...you know?) The humor is crude, and the only thing that keeps it from being just totally trash is the wide array of celbrity voices! DO NOT GET! It is a total waste of money and time."
1,Awful!,"Before I had seen the film I heard mixed feelings on Shrek. Some people said ""It's really gross. You won't like it"" and others said ""It's great. It isn't bad at all. You'll love it"".Was it bad? Of course not, unless you think burping gags, swearing, adult suggestiveness, eating burned rats, backside refrences and rude gags every other 5 seconds is bad.Seriously, folks, don't waste your money or time."
1,Rated NC- Not for Children,"This is not a movie for children. This is for High School kids and College kids and parents of four year olds that want to watch something with out ELMO in it- but really NOT for little children. I can recognize its appeal to young adults and grown ups but I think it lacks creativity and depth. Some might say that it is just entertainment and doesn't ahve to mean anything but I think that movies can be entertaining for children and adults and be powerful. Toy Story, Finding Nemo, Ice Age, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory... I could go on. Spare your child this movie. They will get enough fart jokes in first grade."
1,AN EYE SORE! IGNORE IT!!,This is one of the most ugliest pieces of ... I ever seen. The characters in it look like corpses of animation. DON'T BUY IT OR EVEN SEE IT!
2,Not very good....,"I went to Shrek thinking it would be a great movie, and came out rather disappointed. Though it had some humour and good music, it had a dull and predictable plot. I found myself practically asleep at the end of it, the humour getting stupider by the minute. I wouldn't see it again or rent it. It was an see-it-once-in-your-life movie, as the humour would bore you to death if you saw it a second time. I'm sure DreamWorks can make better movies than this."
3,Its Good...but not that good,"I went into SHREK with alot of expectation after seeing the Trailers and the massive hit that it was. On seeing the film I didn't find the first half very funny at all, but once the donkey is introduced with the hillarious voice over from Eddie Murphy the film actually is fun. Technically it's great no doubts there and the rest of the voice overs are good...but for me the stuff from PIXAR is still the best. The two Toy Story's and a Bugs Life are great to watch, very funny, action packed and overall great story telling. Not to forget the great outtakes at the end of there movies. But watch Shrek if not for anything then for Eddie Murphy who's great."
2,Yes we know....Donkey is black.,"Yep, voice Eddie Murphy, and wha-la Donkey has every stereotypical black cliche in the book.Yo Yo, bling bling, I'm Donkey. Sup y'all."
1,Shrek,"It is a throw-back of Disney Animation, but with a spice for modernization. It's characters are curt, wholesome characters, the humor I found boring and undermining to the likes of Eddie Murphy and Cameron Diaz. Do they really need to work so badly as to diminish themselves to hidden comedy. It's a far cry from their acting abilities so well demonstrated in the likes of ""The Golden Child"", and ""Something About Mary"". Cummon, do they need to make themselves so invisible here?If you like comedy, go find the artistic expression in its live form; bury this ""Toy Story"" nonsense already. It's played out with Tom Hanks. Give me something like the presence of Paula Poundstone or Rodney Dangerfield, live. Even Rodney strut his ""stuff"" in ""Caddyshack"". :) And please, let the kids find something less contrived to laugh at, like the ""Tubbies"" or ""Smerfs"". They will be adults soon enough; they don't need the adult addages that this ""Shrek"" infers throughout its entirety. kz"
4,PARENT'S BEWARE!!!,"While my husband and I both really enjoyed this movie, there was some foul language that I think that a children's movie can do without. My two-year old didn't catch the undertones and language and really loved the movie but if you have an older child, I am sure that they will pick up on some of this.Other than that, I thought that it was a great movie and had a good message. Just rent with caution. This is rated PG not G."
2,"Good Ideas, but honestly a bore ! Great 4 kidz though.","Funny at times, new ideas incorporated into fantasy animation, but still not much here. Great for kids but not much replay or worth on an adult level. Its good but not great ! A good watch once, but thats it.OO Agent"
3,Double Meanings,"I never went to see this movie when it was in the theaters. It was the only movie that managed to stick around all summer long (in 2001), while others came in and went out like a flame on a match stick.I eventually ended up watching it a while later, and regretted the fact that I didn't see it in the movies. Though the movie is great for all ages, the adults would find something that they like, as well as the kids.I'm not going to give away the movie, but I did like the story. I'm glad that Fiona and Shrek got together, but at the same time, Lord Whatever (cannot spell his name if my life depended on it) shows us just how superficial we can be. Heck, he didn't look all that good, either!If you're looking for a twist in a somewhat modern and hilarious fairy tale, Shrek is where you should start."
4,"Entertaining,but...","I don't see what all the hype was over, it's just a average, feel good animated movie, i enjoyed ""Toy Story"" more, but it is a great DVD to own."
5,Shrek is masterful,"Shrek is one of the greatest films of all time. Although it appears to be a children's movie, the humor has been directed at all age groups and maturity levels. My family loved it so much, that we've passed it on to even my grandmother! The simple jokes and allusions (especially to Lord Farquad's height) are creative and sly. Although Shrek (Mike Meyers) does a fabulous job in this film, I would have to say that Eddie Murphy (Donkey) steals the show with his witty commentary and wisecracks. You must see Shrek, whether you are a kid or an adult. Don't be ashamed to rent it...the guy behind the counter will understand."
4,Good Fun and Entertaining,"Not knowing much about the movie when we took our eight year old to see it, we were plesantly surprised by the wit and humor of the script. Some may consider the humor and wordplay mildly crude but it is delightful for youngsters. I personally enjoyed the earwax scene. The film's animation is superb and the soundtrack is alot of fun. Overall the film is very entertaining."
4,Fun movie for all ages,"I really liked the movie, but was dissappointed that Eddie Murphy played the comic relief talking donkey. I did'nt find any of the jive donkey's humor funny. Don't get me wrong, I loved Eddie Murphy in Golden Child and Bev. Hills Cop. BUT, him in Shrek, he was annoying to me, brought me back out of the movie thinking of Eddie Murphy, and not amused me.I can't wait for Monsters, Inc!"
2,huh?,"Wow, I guess I am one of the few who didn't like this movie. In fact, I didn't even finish watching it. I was really interested to see it after all the good things I had heard. I am also a big fan of Eddie Murphy, but it was completely overdone...The 2 stars are for the animation...."
4,Mara's Review of Shrek,"So before I go out and rent Shrek, I am told that it is the best movie of the year. I get my hopes up, believing that Shrek will entertain me and all that, but I was a little disappointed. Don't get me wrong. It was a hilarious movie with a cute story line, but I don't think I can consider it the best movie of the year. Yes, the donkey, or I should say Eddie Murphy, does do a great job with the little humorous dialogue here and there but it just needed a little bit more from every character.The day before I rented Shrek, I saw the movie Monsters Inc.. I definetly compared the two and I thought Monsters a more all around cute, hilarious, and great story line movie. This is probably my source of comparison and is probably where my synicism arised from. I guess the two movies are very much different but I definetly believe Shrek really uncomparable to Monsters Inc."
5,WONDERFUL!!!,"Shrek had everything: Action, comedy, romance, and even some parts were you want to cry. It is a faboulous movie for the whole family and everything about it is cool!"
4,Funny movie! About the sticker....,"Hey everyone! My first review and I 'm using it to tell every how to remove sticker glue. If you happened to take the entire sticker off of the DVD of Shrek, fear not. Just take something else with a sticky back,(like another sticker) and place it on the glue, and pull on the sticker. Do it as many times as you have to. It works great. It will be smooth and glossy. The only thing you`ll have left is the square indent from the original sticker. By the way, Shrek was a very funny movie, I recommend it! Go rent it or buy it! Bye!"
3,"Definite Appeal, But Far From Great","SHREK has some appealing moments. It also has some nice things to say about how society focuses too much on external beauty and not enough about a person's soul. Unfortunately, a lot of the film's inherent charm is diminished by the crude way in which it is handled. This is really a shame, because the film could have been so much more.Apparently, studio executives dread the ""G"" rating like the plague. Instead, they insert unnecessary scatological humor to ""beef up"" the rating. Hopefully, this pattern will change, but it doesn't appear likely.In short, you might want to keep the little kids away from this one. It might pass for older kids and teenagers, but you might want to consider other alternatives first. If in doubt, pre-screen the film first."
1,Wrong product and I'm 99 percent sure that it is pirated!,"Our story is simple. We ordered Shrek 1 and we received Shrek 2, a movie that we already owned. Not too big of a deal since we didn't pay very much for the item. There was something about the movie that seemed fishy, however. The DVD cover seemed to be printed on someone's home printer. Upon opening the case, it was easy to see that the movie had been burned at home as well (the graphics on the DVD itself were fuzzy and illegible). When we ordered the movie, we were told that it was a ""two-disc special edition"", apparently that meant that disc one contained half the movie and disc two the other half! On top of that the quality of the picture was terrible... yep, definitely pirated. We'll probably just end up throwing the movie away. In conclusion, not the best buyer/seller transaction!"
2,"Not bad, but there are much better animated movies","I just saw Shrek for the first time. I had heard tons of positive comments on the movie, but I'm that impressed. Animated movies like Ice Age or How To Train Your Dragon are way better than this movie.It wasn't that bad, but I'm not sure why everybody likes this movie that much. I found a lot of the characters kind of irritating, and the storyline was too simple (ever for a children's movie)."
4,Shrek does it for everybody,"Hilarious. This movie is just well tought. You can be an adult, you can be a kid, you'll enjoy it"
5,*Fun Movie*,"I recieved this movie ""Shrek"" for Xmas. After I got finished watching this movie, I thought that movie was great. And so please buy this movie, it isreally a great movie!!!!! SHREK IS THE BEST FUN MOVIE EVER.."
4,Family fun.,"Shrek is a cute movie but gets annoying after watching it more than once. Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, and Cameron Diaz provide the voices for Shrek, Donkey, and Princess Fiona. There are some sarcastic and lovable moments in this box-office smash! Great to watch with friends and family, too bad the sequel was less than impressive, stick with the original."
5,Very pleased!,I received my copy of the movie within a few days. Very fast shipping and DVD in perfect condition.
5,Even I had fun.,"My grandson took me to the theater more than once to see Shrek. It's worth it, plus I got to see him light up. Little squirt practically memorized the script. So I had to have the video, what can I say -- I'm easy.It's the best. 5 stars."
5,Movie of the Year,"2 of the most enjoyable hours I've spent watching a recent movie. It's another great film by Mike Myers. Laugh, cry all the good stuff and hilarious lines to boot."
1,Looking forward to returning it tomorrow.,"Shrek-3D... not going to watch it. I planned to watch it tomorrow.Went to watch Shrek first... and as another commenter noted, it's the FULL-SCREEN edition!The 2-pack comes with a cardstock wrapper, with Shrek3-D listed, then Shrek. Shrek3-D is widescreen. Shrek is not.Did I think to check Shrek info after Shrek3-D, in the store, ultra-small print? No. Stupid me.So... it's going back tomorrow, opened.Why in the name of all that's holy would you release a new widescreen feature (or short, in this case) and bundle the full-screen??????? Twits."
1,Just Plan Rotten,"Bundle the Shrek movie with a mini 15 minute DVD.....O.K., I might have bought it because I don't have Shrek on DVD yet.....but, they released it with the Full Screen version!!!! WHY!!!!!! That was just plain....uhhhh....""DUH""!!!!! Do they think that they won't make money by selling Shrek 3-D on its own? Do they just have a stock-pile of Full Screen versions and want to get rid of them? Why bundle a Full Screen with a Widescreen 3D???? WHY, WHY, WHY???? Sheesh!!!! Don't waste your time or your money. Go see the 4D at Universal Studios and enjoy.....or if they sell it seperatly, but chuck this deal where it belongs...in the waste bin until they stop trying to be SO money hungry!!!"
2,changes,"I bought this book hoping to find help for what my DR is calling a ""bad episode"" of my psoriasis.I did like this book but would have been much happier to find some help that does not mean I have to do a 360 degree turn around in my life. I have incorporated some of the changes in my diet and I am hoping this will help."
1,No Big Deal,This book is just a rehash of macrobiotices which may help some but not anyone who doesn't do well with soy products that are a part of the macrobiotic diet. Don't waste your money
5,she's taken the 'die' out of diet!,"i applaud ms. earls' approach in her book Your Healing Diet.she was able to present it in a manner that gave me confidence, for the first time, to take charge of my healthand not have it overwhelm me. she has simplified what ihave seen before to cover volumes, and gives practicalsuggestions and guidance....and it all passes the 'tastetest'!"
1,Great Disapointment,"This book isn't worth the time spent on reading it.Great in generalities, but very little in specifics.Doesn't even provide menus to follow. If you buy it be prepare to go to a nustritionist to implement it."
1,your healing diet,This book may be helpful to someone just learning to live with psoriasis.I have been living with the condition for many years and so it wasn't information new to me.
1,Pass on this one,You do not get a diet to follow. Very frustrating. A lot of science and supplement suggestions. I would not recommend.
1,"No good , it is waste of time to read this book",This book is a rip off. It is actaully a poor copy of John Pagano's book.
4,Entertaining,I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought this but was surprised to find it very good. It kept my attention all the way through and at times even had me on edge wondering what would happen next which is not an easy thing to do for me.The film begins with a brand new airliner suddenly colliding with a small private plane and it becomes the pilots job to get his plane back down on the ground with all his passingers safe. It's worth the purchase.
5,Excellent for learning to do transparencies,I ordered this book because I'm interested in learning to create the illusion of transparency in my own quilts. I found it an excellent resource for this process and would highly recommend it for anyone else who is interested in achieving this type of process in their work.
2,I do not recommend this book.,"Thinly based on Marilyn Monroe's life. Small town girl raised in foster homes rises to be a star: pinup calendar, soft porn, then Hollywood. She marries a ""legend"" in NY baseball history, divorces,and marries a playwrite. She gradually disintegrates, driven by her insecurities, drugs, and alcohol. No suspense, no sympathy for the characters, gratuitous sex scenes."
4,It's not the best RUN-DMC album but it's def a collectors item.,"To me, ""Beats to The Rhymes"" is my favorite song on the album. That's not to say there's not any more dope tracks on this album. If your a RUN-DMC fan, you must have this album in your collection."
2,Sales Presentation,"As I was reading this book, I felt like I was at a sales presentation. Lots of razzmatazz and little substance. It just skimmed over everything and didn't really explain anything. Then I got to the back of the book and found all the pages of products for sale by the author's company and realized that it was a sales presentation."
4,reminds me of home,"I was touched deeply of the courage of Janey Larkin. She knew that one day she would live out her dream of finding a new home just like her prized ""blue willow plate"". Janey's father moved from one place to another to look for work. Each season ending, he moved. This story depicts courage as a strong and mighty force through the eyes of one little migrant girl, Janey."
4,very good book but boring at times,I read this book for the gifted program we had months to finish but I ended up bring it in a bit late because it's one of those books that gets boring at some parts of the book. Although it is still a wonderful book it kinda reminds me of books like the wind in the willows so if you like wind in the willows you should really read this
5,Glimpse into the past.,Hardtimes are nothing new. In this wonderful classic a step-mother helps to keep the memory of the childrens mother alive and honored. The Blue Willow plate binds them all together and ever hopeful.
5,Billy Ocean CD,It arrived quickly and in good condition. I have played it over 35 times and it has worked flawlessly every time. This beats going to a cut-rate used CD shop.
2,very average listen to the pre-80's Billy for the real,this disc is okay but it doesn't show the talent&depth of this man.from 76-82 he was grooving.then he came stateside and was watered down.this set hardly does the man justice.he is a very talented artist who deserves better.
4,Great dance music - for hustle,"Most of the songs I heard had a great beat for dancing, especially hustle"
4,A Great Album by a Great artist,"I didn't even know I'd become a Billy Ocean fan until long after it happened. I was looking through my Billboard's Top Hits CDs when I noticed that one of the artists' names seemed more... well, noticeable than the others. Upon closer inspection, I found that no less than 3 songs I loved were all done by the same guy! I looked ...[on-line], and found even more songs by him that I liked. I quickly dubbed myself a Billy Ocean fan.This is a concentrated dose of some good Billy Ocean... um... goodness. At least half the songs on it are outstanding. A great album for anyone, whether or not you're a fan."
2,Mary Meade's Country Cookbook: Traditional American Cooking,"This cookbook is great in the sense that the meals are easy to prepare and you don't have to buy a lot of ""strange"" or ""different"" ingredients to make the recipes. What one needs to realize is that if you like this cookbook and want to buy others from her, the old, out of print cookbook titled ""Mary Meade's Country Cook Book"" is the one and same, page for page, recipe for recipe."
5,Excellent quality!!,This collection of 3 CDs is gold to have in the house especially because Al Bano and Romina will remain a legend in Italian music. A must-have for the Italian music lovers. Plus the sound quality of these 3 CDs is excellent!!
3,Oily but works.,I bought this product in anticipation of a trip to Mexico where we would be in the sun a lot and there are a lot of mosquitos. It was advertised as natural bug repellant as well as sunblock. It sprays on easily but is very oily. It worked great for me as both a repellant and sunblock. It does not have a strong odor - almost no odor at all. The only problem was that my husband broke out in a red rash after using it on his shoulders and back. And it irritated and stung my daughter's skin after I sprayed it on her as a touch up after other sunblock had been applied. The other sunblock was something that we have always used in the past. I definitely liked that it was eco-friendly though and would use it again for myself.
3,Contents weren't made clear,"An excellent book.But you must know: it's writing style, layout, etc are quite dated.Content is fine (because, really: how much has the violin changed in the last 100 years)."
3,Nice!,"It's perfect for french manicure, but for use alone doesn't work, is so clear; it's like clear polish with a little shade."
5,Excellent nail polish,"I ordered this polish in white (blanc). I was worried that like some other white polishes I've seen that it would end up looking like I'd put white out on my nails. Or that the color wouldn't be a true white. But this polish went on very smooth and the color is wonderful. I've never used Essie before, but I think I've found a new favorite polish."
2,Disappointment,"It's a really nice color if you apply one coat, but we all know with colors like these you have to apply at least 2, but once you apply the 2nd coat the color changes. Also after a week I removed the nail polish and it stained my nails. Don't recommend."
1,Chipfest,"I bought this based on the reviews. VERY unimpressed. I touch up chips twice a day! I usually use OPI, which will last two weeks with minimal maintenance. This didn't make it 3 days. The colors are pretty, but even Sally Hanson outlasts Essie, and at a third the price. My first bottle will be my last bottle."
3,Not for me,"This is a review for the color ""Shindig""Its a little more pink then I would have expected. I thought it would be more of an orange color. However, the color started to grow on me the longer I wore it. It has a very pretty pearly sort of sheen to it which gives it some interest. Its not my favorite color but I usually lean more toward blues, purples, and greens. The color was quite sheer too. I think it took me about 4 coats to get it to a nice opaqueness. All in all, I don't this I would purchase this color again, but I'll use up the rest of the bottle."
3,Essie Has Formaldehyde,"Essie has some very beautiful colors, but all the nailpolishes have formaldehyde. There are other brands that also have pretty colors and are Big 3 free. Would not recommend this product. 3 stars for the color selection."
4,"Not EXACTLY what I expected, but pleased","The color is more coral/orange than I expected, but I am pleased with it nonetheless. Two coats of it will give you full coverage (unlike other Essie colors.) Looks good with the high gloss sheen, as well as with the Matte About You top coat."
3,Somewhat pleased....,"Don't get me wrong, I love, love, love the nail polish. Not to mention - the price cannot be beat! It was of the quality I expected BUT it was different than the one I had at home. I had bought it at the nail salon and fell in love with it. It goes on very sheer with a nice shimmer and is great for the summer, however, the one I had at home is not as pink as the one I ordered. So, if you're looking for a color that you already have don't be surprised if the one you order on line is a bit different. I have to say though, for the price, the slight difference in color is not a big deal."
1,NATURAL NAIL SHADE/NOT PINK,"If you want a natural nail tint, that looks like color of the real nail bed, this is the shade for you. It is not as pink as the photo; it's more cream. Really sheer, just perfect for a french manicure. Not for me though, I like my colors more saturated, even with a Fnch.ManiFollow up April 30, 2011: I went to the local salon, and found this shade, and guess what? this shade is not sheer. It is semi opaque. A few coats will give solid coverage. And the color is a creamy soft pink; not like the one I purchased on Amazon. Don't know what is up with the distributor; not the seller. Very disapointed, 'cause I have had to return 3 nail lacquers thus far; and without return shipping reimbursement.Update: The seller did reimburse one way shipping charges."
3,it serves its purpose,"I already had the color and used it so much I had to get another one. It shipped fast but the color of the polish was a little off. When i compared the new bottle to my old one it didn't seem nude enough. It actually reminded me more of Essie's ""Not Just a Pretty Face"" color. Either way it was still a neutral shade and I've worn it a few times."
4,I'm pleased,"Nice color, Kinda a light peachish color. The order arrived very quickly. I had to put on a good 4 or 5 coats on each nail to make the color really show which is why its 4 stars not 5."
4,Favorite Versatile Shade,"This is a light pink shade with an opalescent effect. It is long-wearing and a perfect choice for the base coat of a French manicure. The shade is subtle yet attractive. It's wonderful for a pedicure as well. The color will work for all skin tones, and small chips are hardly noticeable. It's the ""go-to"" shade for any occasion. Great color for nails of all lengths. Essie products are known for their quality, but I held back a rating star due to price point."
3,Average,Nice nail color however chips by day 6.. Right price but overpriced for shipping. I purchased another nail color from them at the same time. I got two shipping charges when both nailpollishes come in the same $3 shipping/us postage paid envelope ! I paid $12 in shipping. What a rip off and especially when both polishes chip in less than a week! Color is nice is only thing that is good.. Natural without looking white
2,too bright,even brighter in person than in pic and once on. maybe at my darkest in the summer i would wear this. almost neon.
1,not worth the money,"Ask plenty of questions about product and merchandise as these items appear new in picture, but merchandise clearly been used or were tester products."
1,Not as pictured,"Sea Breeze has been my favorite Essie color, and since it such an old color, most stores no longer carry it. So when I discovered it listed with this seller on Amazon, I was pleased. Unfortunately, the polish that I received was nothing like the original Sea Breeze that I have so enjoyed. I've simply tossed it rather than go to the trouble of returning it. I DO NOT recommend this product as offered by this seller!!!"
5,Love it!,i love the color. my mom used to wear nail polish like this in her early days and when i got her this she really liked it. Its not a brown colo. its kind of a dark brown with a hint of dark red. really nice!!
5,Top notch,"This is a quality product that works like its supposed to. I had terrible heartburn, was eating antacids like candy, nothing helped. Because of the effect on my vagus nerve, I was also having heart palpitations on a regular basis. A nurse I work with suggested I try digestive enzymes and told me Garden of Life was a quality brand.Noticed almost an immediate difference. One capsule with each meal and no more heartburn and the palpitations are just about non-existent. I have been using these for several months now and I have not had to use an antacid since then. I can eat anything, even bananas, which I had stopped eating years ago because they caused me so much of a problem.Its a lot better taking enzymes than antacids and other medications and Garden of Life is good quality and the cost is reasonable."
2,No benefits I can detect.,"I was so impressed with the claims on the box and the scientific knowledge they seemed to indicate that I bought this for $36 instead of what I usually buy (Solar Ray Super Digest Away for ~$16--I am also using Betaine HCL routinely now) but so far I can't detect if this product helps at all.I was feeling similarly confused about the Super Digest Away--which was a turning point product for me it seemed for a time, compared to the more powerful but maybe a little scary Betaine, the Digest Away seemed neglible in it's effects. But this product seems very neglible given the claims the labels make. I am disappointed. It was a big purchase for me.Maybe I'm just going thru a bad digestion phase and not feeling the benefit?? I note that two others here had outright BAD experiences, so I'm dubious about this product. And the claims had really given me hope! :("
2,DIDNT WORK FOR ME AT ALL - BUT AMAZON REFUNDED WITHOUT ISSUE,These are supposed to increase your metabolism & clean out your digestive system. They really did NOTHING but bind me up. Amazon VERY GOOD about returns & got my money back.
1,Didn't Work for Me,"I like Amazon because I like to read the reviews and this product seemed to have glowing reviews. I have many foods that I cannot eat, including dairy and I was hoping that adding enzymes would solve the problem. I took these one pill a day for a whole week, WITHOUT changing me diet to see how my body reacted. I was running to the bathroom everyday. I stopped taking the pills and I was back to normal. These pills made me sicker than if I had eaten my ""problem"" foods. I understand everyone is different but I was extremely disappointed."
4,I am a huge fan,"I have IBS and have had it for many years. I was told nothing would help from Walgreens. It has been so bad that sometimes I have not even been able to get out of the house without taking something to make me stop using the restroom. Then My boss recommended Primal Defense. Since taking it, my system is more normal then ever. Don't get me wrong it doesn't stop the IBS but, it helps maintain a healthy system where there is less incidents and I can focus on more important things. It takes a couple of weeks to get in your system. Also note, I stay away from things that trigger the IBS and I take primal defense once a day. YIPPEEEEEEEE!!!Garden of Life Omega-Zyme Ultra Ultimate Digestive Enzyme Blend, Capsules, 90-Count Bottle"
1,This product is burning up my urinary tract.,Be fair warned that digestive enzyme product has given me severe urinary tract burning. It contains turmeric and ginger. Q-Zyme by Garden of Life should be avoided. It is a horrible product.
2,Excruciatingly detailed and esoteric at times,"This book is a decent text; however, I found it to be excruciatingly detailed at times and also quite a bit esoteric. The book goes in to so much detail, that it is usually hard to find a suitable and understandable explanation for basic concepts. It is better, probably, for higher level biology classes."
1,Overwhelmingly detailed and poorly written,"Choice of words, writing style and teaching of biology is NOT satisfactory in this book. Not a good way to learn CELL bio, maybe functional at higher levels but definitely not useful in explaining new concepts. Occassionally the sentences do not even seem properly formed. i.e. fragments and more often ultra-run on sentences with no structure and no clarity. Frustration - the emotion experienced while reading this book."
2,Meh book - meh subject,"For a pretty intro level class, this book does not do a very good job of presenting the information."
1,Very confusion and tough to read,"I'm a BIO major and this book must be the worst text I've been required to read. Seems to be a giant collection of facts, somewhat organized into chapters and extremely difficult to read and follow. If you have to read this text, be sure that your instructor explains it clearly or else you're screwed! I'd give it a 1/2 star but 1 is the lowest this system allows."
2,World of the Cell,"As a textbook, it is very general and is only a small companion to the rest of the class. It is one that you can do without if you are a decent student who pays attention to lectures and studies adequately for tests."
1,Dull and Boring Intro to Cell Biology,"This was an incredibly boring and dull book. Normally, I find it interesting to read biology books for my classes, but this one was so boring that it was painful to read. The author goes way into detail about the individual enzymes involved in every single cell process. The book is so detailed that it makes it difficult for students to get the ""big picture"" out of every concept covered. Every time I tried to read chapters of this for my class, I would fall asleep. I talked to other friends who were in my class. Everyone agreed that this book was plain horrible to read. If you are required to read this for your class, then I feel sorry for you. All I can recommend is that you go to all of your professor's lectures and write down everything they say so that you don't have to read World of the Cell."
5,Hilarious!,Glad to find a cult classic! The movie packaging was even better than I expected for the price. Hilarious movie!
2,Automatically shuts off in only 4 seconds ... Errrgh,One would think 4 seconds of illumination is sufficient ... and for some problems it is. But when I am searching for the correct key and they trying to insert that key into its slot this is a 6 second procedure.Therefore one has to start all over again ... and somethimes a 3rd time.They need to reprogram this lamp to make it useful for all occasions.
4,"Very useful, light","Very useful, light output is easily controlled by variable pressure switch. it can also blink or flash SOS. I leave it on demo mode - light goes off in about 3 seconds, because I have accidentally bumped the switch on and exhausted the two 2016 batteries.Good battery life."
5,Perfect little light,"My daughter refused to carry any of the ""safety"" items I've forced upon her keychain... until I gave her this little light. She's kept it on her keychain for 3 months now, so I think it's there to stay! I use mine for PERRLA at work, it's perfect! Bright enough for anything I would need at work and so tiny I don't notice it hanging from my clip. Highly recommend!"
5,Love this!,"Perfect keychain flashlight. It's small, it's bright, the battery has lasted quite a while so far. It can blink and strobe and you can adjust the brightness. None of this is really necessary for me, but maybe other folks will want that."
4,Nice light,It works as intended and for the purpose I bought it for (dog potty walks in the dark). I'd buy it again for sure.
1,"A frustrating read, with no resolution in sight","After all of the great reviews, I was VERY disappointed with this book. And frustrated. I found the ending ruined the story. There were a lot of really good passages in this book, however. But in the end the story is rendered pointless. For me the book was a pointless journey, and in the end it was completely meaningless. It made me angry that I got hooked on the story so quickly, only to find absolutely no meaning and no redeeming qualities in the end. A total waste of time. Too bad. It could have been fantastic. Even 3 years later, the waste of my time spent reading this book is the only thing memorable about it."
5,Magical Mystery Tour,"This has become on of my favorite books. I recommend it heartily to certain friends who are willing to take a ride on a magical realism journey where danger and romance are encountered in an alternate reality that is similar to but diffracted from our own. I'm a sucker for all things circus and the author worked under the big top himself and knows his stuff. The author is reminiscent of Hitchcock, Cormac McCarthy and Jim Crace in his ability to create an ordinary character we care deeply about who perseveres in the face of danger and despair. His second novel, Tattoo Girl, is also a dark masterpiece of magical realism. As another reviewer said, ""Circus"" is ""difficult to describe"". Since it won't be in a bookstore by this time, check out the Amazon ""preview"" at top of page and see if a few pages grab you. I hope more readers will motivate the author to bang out another book."
3,Interesting...and confusing...,"I'm not an afficianado of ethereal plots or esoteric ideals. Doesn't mean I don't enjoy it, as displayed in Mr. Stevens' narrative. I was, indeed, grabbed by the first few pages, and kept reading, thinking this would lead to an interesting conclusion. Since I was a novice to this form, I greatly appreciated Mr. Stevens' ability not to give anything away, treating all readers like first-timers. This, to me, was good. There was a lot of potential regarding secret societies, and the dream-like quality of the whole thing was intriguing. All-in-all, I was expecting more. After such an impressive build-up, the ending was a disappointment. I'm left wondering what it was all about. This is, apparently, not a genre that I'm prone to. Sorry..."
2,Hmmm,I enjoyed the imagery and the insights into the circus. I didn't enjoy the dozen or so loose ends and the 10 pages used at the end to explain the previous 370. Nor did i enjoy the cliched 'up to interpretation' ending. The book reminds me of a talented first time directors mistake of forgetting the story as a whole. I was led down a twisting and arduous pathway and I arrived ... nowhere.
4,"Different, imaginative, can't-put-down, excellent.","The book has a strong start, he uses lots of strange and wonderful imagery, you don't know where the story is going or how it's going to end. I felt the book should have been a little bit longer and had a stronger finish."
5,Awesome Hip Hop DVD!,"Excellent, easy to follow instruction and great, great fun. I bought this dvd for my daughter's birthday to supplement her classes at her dance studio. Instructor Barry YoungBlood has an engaging personality and breaks the moves down very well - as if you're actually in his class. The four high energy routines he teaches are each different in speed and difficulty which makes for a great variety. Well Done!"
4,Good alternative,Pretty good alternative. I drink it black so I use a stronger brew than recommended.
1,One of most offensive movies ever made,"This was an amateur film competition which produced one of the most offensive films ever made. Let's go over the list.Ben Affleck, a Catholic from Boston. Pete Jones, a Catholic from Chicago, whose older brother is a Catholic priest working in Catholic-Jewish relations for the Vatican.What's the subject of Pete's script?A young Catholic boy decides he has to help a non-Catholic get into heaven, so he announces a plan to go to a synagogue, find a poor Jewish boy who isn't going to heaven, and allow him the good fortune of converting to Catholicism.That's a great plan - if you're Catholic and don't understand much outside of your own narrow framework of the universe.If you're Jewish... all you want to do is pretend this film never happened."
1,Boring! Boring!,"The movie starts off slow and gets slower. Don't know what was worse, the directing or the story itself. Avoid unless you need a nap."
1,"Good show, bad movie.","The show was a very interesting foray into the movie-making business. However, the movie itself flat out [was bad]. It was worse than ""Reindeer Games"". And I think we can all agree that ""Reindeer Games"" was a pretty bad movie. I'd be embarassed to put my name on that piece of ... If Pete Jones is the future of filmmaking, I weep for the future."
3,Introductory Winston-Buy The Original Albums Instead,These are edited versions of George's best music. You would be better served by getting the original albums starting with Autumn and December. The moods he develops come out better in the context of the album as a whole rather than as the individual song cuts.
3,The four seasons are all on one CD not four,The music is great but I was somehow led to believe there are four CDs in the pack.
5,There are pictures of Nature in his music,"For the ones who are looking for the music which presents pictures, George Winston's ""seasons"" is a must to have for you!"
4,This is D-Nice's breakthrough into Old School Hip Hop,"In ""Call Me D-Nice"" by D-Nice, one of the greatest old school rappers introduces himself. D-Nice is a smooth rapper who knows how to make his beats hit home with lyrics that just flow. ""The TR 808"" as he calls himself, is an awesome contribution to any rap lover's hip hop library."
2,mystified,"I don't get how a book like this totally omits mention of the Greek island of Rhodes, which is a World Heritage Site, for crying out loud."
2,1975 reissue,"There are 12 tracks. Six are based on vocals by the Hawaiian female Kapiolani, with some contributions by Lyman. The vocals are weak. Tracks 6, 7, 9, 11 are excellent instrumentals, and 12 is jazzy. Adios Marquita Linda was my reason for buying, and it's one of the best songs ever. If you can get it at a good price it can be worth it. This is a reissue of his 1975 album on the GNP Crescendo label.The sound has loads of resonance."
3,"You get one binder, not four","Binder is good quality but you only get one, not four like the picture leads you to believe. I expected four of various colors."
1,rip-off,"Who is Wilson Jones? I don't know, but I paid $8.06 for a single, I repeat: single, flexible 3-ring binder. Now the picture may give the impression that you get 4, but I only one and in dildo-pink at that! Because I have an urgent need for the binder, I don't have the time to return it for a refund. Buyers beware."
4,I LOVE PATTI AUSTIN....,"and this is one of my favorite albums by her. The different musical styles she explores on this album, and successfully conquers, shows just what a fine singer she is. Patti has done this type of album before, with the 1980 CTI ""Body Language"" album. Jam and Lewis show what great producers they are, that they can work with Janet, Cherrelle, and Patti, and have each artist put their own stamp on the material. I get the impression that Patti sings songs that seem to mean something to her. And once she puts her vocals to the tune, it definitely becomes her own. She can get funky (Heat of Heat), sensual (Only a Breath Away), or just touching (If I Believed). It's so nice to be able to find others who admire and enjoy her talent as much as I do. This is one of her best albums."
4,"Patti Brings ""The Heat""","As a Patti Austin fan since day 1, I must say that IMO ""Getting Away With Murder"" stands alone her best ""Pop"" LP to date. I own the LP, cassette and purchased the CD on German import years ago and still groove to it today. The ""Jam & Lewis"" cut ""The Heat of Heat"" is Patti at her soulful best with the songs ""Only A Breath Away"" & ""Honey For The Bees"" fast on it's heels. For the fans, who like me fell under Patti's spell with her ""Quiet Storm"" sound, she comes through with the hypnotic ""Summer Is The Coldest Time of year"" and the lush ""If I Believe"". My only gripe is that the single/video version of the title track as well as the extended 12 inch mixes of ""The Heat of Heat"" and ""Only A Breath Away"" are not included as a bonus cuts. Still, this CD is a must have for any fan and a wonderful introduction to Patti's diverse talent."
5,Patti Austin is one of the all-time greats,"Patti is pure soul! If it has Patti's name on it, there are two things you can count on: Quincy Jones and the awesome power of Patti herself! This is a must have cd."
4,Great product,We purchased this cover so that we could keep the riding mower outside for the season. We wanted to protect the mower from the rain and sun. While some rain did get through the cover...we are very happy with our purchase. Cover fits great and very easy for one person to put on mower.
5,Lawn Tractor Cover,This brand of cover is the very best. It covers my 54-inch lawn tractor perfectly. My first on held up for 4 years and I have just purchased another one. The elastic hold up very well. The tarps I used to use did not do a good job.
5,Lawn tractor cover,"Purchased this product a little over a month ago and so far it has been very good. The elastic on the cover is very durable. I own a 42"" deck Craftsman tractor and I leave it outside in the elements. It covers the entire tractor with room for a larger tractor. The water repellent feature works and it keeps my tractor clean. I give the product 5 stars but remember I recently purchased the product. Good Luck!!"
5,Satisfied,"Slight delay between shipping of product after I ordered it. Used the cover on 46-inch Ariens mower. Completely covers tractor and bed. Has elastic on bottom to secure cover in place. Easy to remove, takes several minutes to apply cover."
2,Nice Cover But It Doesn't Last,"The elastic cord hemmed in the bottom makes this cover fit snugly on my riding mower. I have also found it to be quite waterproof.That said I must add that I have to replace it every year. I have to leave my mower in a place where it gets the sun for half of every day, and it gets every drop of our 32 inch annual rainfall. After about a year it begins to actually shred and fall apart. I always keep a new one in reserve for when this happens. A bit expensive, but I guess it's better than my mower standing nude in the sun and rain. I've noted that there are other covers on the market that are a higher denier fabric, and that have special coatings. They are higher priced, but I think I will go that route for my next replacement."
4,Good Cover,"I have only had this cover for one month, but looks like it is going to be a good one. Has elastic around bottom so wind is not an issue. May rip easily with taking on and off of tractor, so will have to be really careful. Good so far."
4,Riding Lawnmoer Cover,I was pleasantly surprised at how well made this cover is. It is made high quality material and looks like it will last for a long time. I priced similar covers for twice the price and they were not as well made as this one. It fits the mower and has a very strong elastic hem to make the fit weather proof.
3,The Awesome Trail bikes by Shane Harvel,"The Trail Bikes is a really good book.If you are looking for adirt bike,or if your looking for how to ride one this is theplace for you go to.Believe me this is the place for you togo to.GOOD LOOK"
2,Skip it and try one of Norton's many other better ones,"Blake Walker is a warden who is called upon to track the whereabouts of one of two sisters, who has vanished while in a transport ship on another world. His task leads him across alternate worlds and timelines, and he encounters political mysteries and intrigue.Science is lacking in this novel, and character development is non-existent. Many of Norton's books feature people or animals/aliens that are interesting and easy to like. Not so here. Telepathy is prominent in this story, but here it is strictly between humans, and it far less interesting than other Norton stories involving animal telepathy. There is plenty of action, but not enough background to care about it. Despite all the action, I experienced mostly boredom, and not suspense. This was a rare disappointment for me, with an author that I have always counted on for quality stories."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"This is the second of the Crosstime books by Norton. Blake is well ensconced in the Crosstime life now. However, it doesn't remain peaceful for long. His boss' daughter is kidnapped, and they also uncover another of those dastardly mess up time and alternate worlds conspiracies of badness.Spider-Sense and Mind Shield will definitely get some more use here as he races to sort it out, with some help."
3,Updated Version and full of typos...,"Indeed this is a magnificent book with some beautiful and unique photography. However, it is frustrating to wade through page after page of typos and errors. ABS on Corvettes since 1966? (page 187) 1976 Corvette on pages 160-161? (looks like a '73 to me) 1978 Silver Anniversary Corvette on page 134? Looks like an '81 two-tone to me. Etc,etc...I come from a newspaper family, and we call them Proofreaders. But then what can you expect from an ""officially licensed from GM"" book about an American icon, printed in China? If this is the ""updated"" edition, why didn't Universe Publishing correct these errors?"
2,ain't what they used to be,"I have worn Gold Toe Fluffies for years, but must agree with several of the reviews about changes : declining quality, smaller size (these don't quite fit my size 10 feet, but are marked for 7-12), wear out quicker (esp. behind the heel), stray elastic strings around the top after first wash, etc. The erratic quality makes it seem that they are buying socks from several source contractors (who are not closely monitored) or that I have received some counterfeits. The price is high for socks that do not wear as well as the old ones.Be aware of the different types - Fluffies are rayon/nylon blend - Cushion Fluffies have thick soles (OK if that is what you need, they are warmer and you need some extra room in the shoe, might be tight if you have cushion sole inserts) - Cotton Fluffies are a completely different type, not as elastic, a little more absorbent, stiffer as they age, holes develop quicker."
5,only socks i buy,i wish the charcoal were on sale like the white and black. i only buy them here when on sale.
2,Disappointing,"I read the reviews before order and got a few anyway. They were right: very poor quality, pilling, hanging threads, ragged top finish, thinner construction. If you are out there, Gold Toe, take a listen to a 40 year customer you just lost probably for good."
1,great for first wear,"The socks were great for one wear, then fell apart. I threw them away after the second or third wear."
1,Worst of the Gold Toe Line,The socks wear out quite fast and become covered in acrylic balls very easily. They look pretty unsightly after just a few wearing. Stick to the other gold toe lines such as the metropolitan or Canterbury as they are much better made and better fabrics. I am surprised they still make this remnant socks from the 60s with this horrible acrylic.
2,Comfy but Crappy,"Yes, they are soft and fluffy and quite comfortable. Unfortunately, they developed holes about five times faster than other socks I bought: I find that after a couple of months, I don't have any of these left."
2,strange in-between,"The color of the socks is great - a nice, deep heathery grey. They are also very soft and long enough.BUT: these are not the casual socks my husband is looking for. They are too thin to wear in casual shoes and boots and too thick and fluffy to be a dress sock. If you're looking for an in-between sock, then this is your sock - otherwise I recommend the Gold Toe Men's Casual Crew sock for wearing in casual (not athletic) boots and shoes.UPDATE: After six weeks of wear - socks fall down without provocation. They look ""hairy"" from so many broken threads. And much of the softness is gone. I removed stars and can no longer recommend this sock."
2,Something's up,Packaged like Gold Toe but sure seem like seconds or knock offs. Doubt I will purshase again. Not very happy.
1,"Save money, buy hanes",I thought I would splurge on nice socks. These are not that comfortable and on the first wear a hole developed. I never had this problem with my hanes socks or other cheap white socks.
1,New Design is too binding,"I have been buying fluffies for years. Previously they had no elastic, and were perfect. The new design is a very sad, and unfortunate innovation. Go back to the original---or at least make some for people like me who don't want to stop or impede circulation by tight elastic."
2,Little House on the Prairie- 9th season,When playing the 1st dvd with the first 4 episodes we found that it was skipping and so we thought that we would clean the disk but it was clean. We were unable to watch those on first few episodes and had to then start with 2nd dvd of set which played for us fine.
1,Last season is HORRIBLE!!!,"I am a huge LHOTP fan! However the show ""jumped the shark"" years before this absolutely terrible last year. Albert's morphine addiction and withdrawal with spewing vomit is a far cry from the fun when Laura put pepper all over Nellie and Almanzo's chicken! Mary, Nellie, PA and MA are all gone so they have the boring Carter family move in to fill the gap. The series is totally struggling to come up with any story so they recycle some from earlier seasons!!! The series hits a low point with the absurd orangutan story to the mute boy to the terrible acting of Shannen Doherty. This season is so embarrassing it is simply unwatchable. Thank got James and Cassandra are gone! Michael Landon should have ended this show after baby Rose Wilder was born. Shame on Landon for destroying this once awesome show!"
3,Still a worthy read,"Informative look beyond just the Hindenburg of the many voyages and tragedies experienced in air travel of this type. The book was originally published in 1957 and then reprinted in 1972 and during this time, many new theories have developed that explain why certain events took place. Although slightly out of date on technology explanations, the material and stories are worth reading."
3,"Some great sounds, yet expected more from meditation","This does have some nice sounds on it, yet I expected much more from the meditation. I was expecting my spirit-guide dolphin to take me on a much more creative journey. Also, at the beginning of the meditation, Acaysha gives the record label credit (why? do they sponsor her?) and spends a good deal of time setting up the meditation (over-explaining). I would feel much better served if she started into the meditation without the superfluous introduction. You may want to give this a try if you are new to meditation."
5,Jammin' Dog!,"The beautiful retriever in this book has a musical muse he wants to share. However, he can't strum guitars and he'd rather chew drumsticks than act out Ringo dreams.Just when the lovable dog has given up hope, he discovers a way he can make music without relying solely on his vocal cords. A sweet story that will make you feel like dancing as well!"
5,Great book for kids!,This is a wonderful book for kids about trying too hard to please someone you love and finally learning how to make others happy by being yourself. The way the dog chews up the instruments is hilarious and my kids love reading that part over and over.
2,What is true?,"I have read many serotonin-related books and I am quite confused. In his book ""Beyond Prozac"" Michael J. Norden, an eminent Psychiatrist, states that the much-publicized high-carbohydrate diet may actually make you depressed and overweight. In ""Potatoes not Prozac"" a high-carb plus protein diet is advocated. Dr. Joel Robertson in his ""Natural Prozac"" states that protein is a dopamine booster. Who should one believe? What is true and what is not? Should one accept Dr. Wurtman's approach as correct? O.K. she is an M.I.T. professor but the other authors have impressive academic credentials as well."
4,Wish I had gotten the Deluxe,"I ordered my stroller here on Amazon, not realizing that they put the Deluxe and the Solo Sport in the same ad. The Solo Sport does NOT have a napper bar, and it does not have handles that extend.Other than not getting the napper bar I had hoped I was getting I am pleased with our purchase. It handles well, has a decent size storage area and will do well with our son who likes to sleep on his tummy. :)The handle bars are comfortable unlike the Mclaren ones that are rubber and just don't feel comfortable.I would buy this again... with the napper bar (to hang toys on, and to have a cup holder for the child).** a year later**Now that I have had this a year, I will say it is hard to steer one handed. I would have/ should have found a stroller I could steer one handed."
4,great stroller,"We purchased this stroller about 2 mos ago. I was hesitant to buy it w/out trying it first but decided to take a chance. We love it! The handles adjust for height & they are paddled for comfort. The wheels offer a smooth ride. The toy bar is nice to hang toys on or rest feet on. It fits in my small sedan trunk nicely. It does take 2 hands to open & close, but once you get the hang of it, it's easy. The sun shade is great!! It has the see thru window in back & front & goes almost all the way down to the toy bar if needed. It protects my son from wind or sun. The storage space is okay. Part of the frame takes away some of the space but it does hold the diaper bag & some other items w/no problem. Plus it looks great!!"
5,Makes you want to fall in love,This was truley one of Rochelle Alers best love story. All My Tomorrows was a wonderful love story holding you spell bound with the turn of each page. You could feel the love between the Lydia and Kennedy. She who fought the love because of past loves that had fail. He who felt he couldn't love because of his own relationship with his a strange father. This is a story you can't put down. Ms Alers is one of my favorite writer.
3,"Great binoculars, Not so great camera","I read the reviews on Amazon before and after buying this binoculars/camera combo. The optics of the binoculars are absolutely amazing and incredible. So clear and crisp. Worth the price I paid for it alone. But I really had higher expectations for the camera, as that was the primary reason for buying this, for my birdwatching. You have to be a good distance away from the subject to get any kind of good, clear pictures, which is possible. If it's anywhere closer than 49 feet (as stated in the manual), the subject in the pictures will be quite blurry and fuzzy. Unfortunately, my plan was to use the binoculars to see the birds in my front yard better and to capture/record them, but they were less than 49 feet away, apparently. The video quality is quite grainy/pixelated and small. Overall, I'm very happy with the binoculars, just not so much with the camera. If only you could capture exactly what you see through these great binoculars..."
3,Good pictures if....,"Keep in mind it's not made for closeup pictures (under 35 feet) and they will not be in focus. The distance photos come out really well IF you can keep the unit steady. The timer is good although most shots, such as wildlife, won't wait 10 seconds. A 2-3 second delay would be better. A tripod, monopod, or something to steady on helps. But I don't mean to come across too negative. Just like using a camera with a telephoto lens, if you you manage a steady shot you get a really good photo. I've captured some really good wildlife shots."
4,Suddenly A Star,"After peaking at number 22 in 1976 with his first hit ""Love Really Hurts Without You"", Billy Ocean spent the better part of next eight years in near obscurity until he burst back on the scene with the number one hit ""Caribbean Queen (No More Love On The Run)"". It is an all-time great 80's hit with a slinky dance groove. It was followed up by ""Loverboy"" which was written by rock producer Mutt Lange and topped out at number two. It has a slick rock guitar crunch over a danceable beat. The title track is a 180 from the first two tracks as it is a straight, syrupy ballad that soared up to number four on the charts. The album peaked at number 9 and marked the start of Mr. Ocean's brief run as the one of the biggest singers in the world."
2,Carribean Queen,"This was on TV all the time to promote Carribean Queen as an 80s classic. I had never heard the song in its entirety, and it clocked in at just above 7 minutes long. Loverboy and Suddenly are also good songs, but not enough for me to rate it higher than a disappointment with the artist as a whole. This is another one of those Cds I found at Wal Mart for 5 bucks. I guess they're still trying to make their money back from the first press. Didn't even include credits, and no lyrics in the package."
5,Wow! A treasure trove for aviation fans.,"I bought this book for my Dad a a gift, and he was a radio man on B29s in the Pacific during WWII. I was amazed at all the detail and material seemingly lifted from original manuals. My dad has just about evetything on video and book about B29s, and this is one of the jewels in the crown of his collection."
5,Awesome Performance,"I would have to say this is the best concert performance I have ever saw! Love the costumes. This show is so fantastic you would want to see it again for the fun of it. These girls work hard and they put up a good show. They sing I Predict A Riot which was awesome. They also sing a medley which has three songs that are, Fame, What A Feeling, and Footlose which are great songs. This show you won't be dissappointed so go and buy it if you love Girls Aloud."
4,No index?,"I love this book but there is no index! If you want to find a tune you have to wade through all the entries in the table of contents, which is do-able but a pain. Why wasn't there an index of song titles?Looking past that you will love this book if you love cajun music. An amazing collection."
4,Beautiful.,"Most live albums are distracting to listen to because of the audience in the background and the less-than-quality sound. Though you do hear the occasional clapping and cry from the tables at Sin-E, the sound is high quality. The versions of ""Eternal Life"" (acoustic) and ""Dream Brother"" are gorgeous. I've had this for awhile, and only recently discovered what gems the two cover songs are. The french song is not your average Buckley cover, but then what IS your average Buckley cover? He sang everything from MC5, Elton John, Billie Holiday, the Smiths...the list goes on. The Van Morrison cover may strike some as wierd at first, but listen, please, because Jeff's voice gets one hell of a workout. Stunning EP from a stunning man. We'll miss you, Jeff."
3,Mixed feelings,"The thing that matters for practical purposes is that this is an original and very informative book - a must-see, without a doubt. The appreciation is dampened, however, by a feeling that ""Common errors in statistics"" was not written and edited with a lot of care. Self-repeats, typos and misplaced paragraphs are one thing - a peculiar thing, in a third edition, with a $50 price tag to boot - but mishandled or forgotten topics are a bigger problem. (Simpson's paradox and Bayesian methods are two examples, of very different magnitudes). Valuable as it is, the book could have been qualitatively better if the authors really invested themselves in the project. Instead, they produced a disorganized laundry list of points, some big, some small, some general, some very specific, some original, some very old.PS. Check out ""Understanding the new statistics"" by Geoff Cummings. Now that's a common error in statistics that he talks about, and a carefully written book."
2,Many errors are common,"I have not seen the first edition. I have received from Amazon the 2nd edition. The authors are salient to errors in statistics but not the material in their own book. For example, Good 2005 is cited on p42 but does not appear in the References. Similarly Wald 1980 on p82. On p144 Hardin and Hilbe 2002 is cited but the only reference is Hardin and Hilbe 2003. On the other hand the authors have left many older references (eg on surveys, p43) stand without noting the new helpful material.Instead I highly recommend Abelson (1995): Statistics as Principled Argument."
5,The Blueprint Of A Legendary Hip-Hop MC!,"KRS-ONE has now proven for 20+ years that he knows how to make great, timeless, and flawless music. This ""Ghetto Music: The Blueprint Of Hip-Hop"" album which dropped in '89 is no exception to the high standards of a legendary career, you just can't go wrong with songs like ""The Blueprint"", ""Jack Of Spades"", ""You Must Learn"", ""Hip Hop Rules"", and ""Ghetto Music"", mcs take note, this is the blueprint."
4,"THE JACK OF SPADES IS IN FULL EFFECT! FRESH FOR 89, SUCKERS!","This is a straight up banging album; with live instruments throughout, the music is crisp and thick with rhythm.Standout cuts: Jah Rules; Jack of Spades; Why is That; World Peace; Who Protects us from You?Bandleader KRS-One flaunts his reggae influence more than ever with this album. Definitely worth picking up, especially those seeking an ""alternative"" to wackness... Long live the Blastmaster!"
4,military bronx respersentive,"i may travel the world being in the military but im truly a bronx resperesentive.....my life belongs to the bronx...so it is a must to buy my peoples album specialy krs one...boogie down productions...will always be rocken...im stationed in germany and they are still crazy about ""by all means necessary""...i just hope they don't ever change their style....stay the same for scot la rock...no need to be like the others....just be true to the self. BOOGIE DOWN PRODUCTS....MADE MUSIC BETTER YESTERDAY AND TOMORROW THEY WILL CHANGE IT FOR BETTER LISTENING PLEASURES. EVEN FOR THE APPLE BITTERS.....!"
4,The real Hip Hop,"Don't believe the hype, this is the best album made by KRS1. Old school heads (I remember i was a new jack when i first bought this) know what i mean.Buy it if you want a glimpse of what the essence of hip hop is and a nice taste of one of the first professional lyricists."
2,"Preachy, Preachy, Preachy","BDP was simply too didactic to ever be very popular. KRS1 was not called `teacher' for nothing. Sadly, what he taught was mostly propaganda, based not on a scholarly assessment of his subjects, but on a quasi-religious belief in his own rhetoric. The beats were OK though, and `Bo Bo Bo' was fun, and relatively free of preaching."
3,"Tippy if free standing, okay with a table",The design and quality of this stand was good. I set it up with a 9ft. umbrella and tried it free standing. When it was free standing it tippped over in very low wind. Now that it is standing in a table it works fine.
2,Wrox's Worst,"This book is curious because it's too simple for an experienced programmer and it makes too many assumptions for a beginner. For those in between there are a few things worth looking at in the book, but by and large it's a waste of money. There's almost 300 pages of material that comes packaged with VBA--it's the entire Word object model, accessible through the Object Browser. Why did Mackenzie include this? Perhaps because a 270 book on Word VBA doesn't look nearly as impressive as a 600 page book on VBA.A better reference for Word development is Guy Hart-Davis' ""Word 2000 Developer's Handbook,"" which is not a stellar book but is MUCH better than Makenzie's. For general VBA development, Ken Getz' ""VBA Developer's Handbook"" is a good resource, though it's really just a bank of ready-made functions."
2,Too light for serious development,This book didn't go into nearly the depth for Word that I needed. The first 4 chapters (~100 pages) were too basic - covering VBA fundamentals (not Word 2000 specific). Chapter 8 & 9 discussed linking to databases which was a useful but any inter-Office programmng book would do better. The last 250 pages is strictly a listing of the object models for Word and ADO (with very little elaboration).It contains very few programming tricks; a few programming practice recommendations; medium amount of simple examples; no troubleshooting or common mistakes section.This book is OK for someone that doesn't like to use the object browser & help file because it doesn't give you much more than that.
3,Usefull and Comprehensive,I found this book very usefull for writing a parser of a Microsoft Word Document. It included references to all the objects that Word Library has availible. I recomend it as a reference. I wouldn't recomand it for somebody who is new to programming.
3,Good as a Word VBA Primer,"I like this book, but it shouldn't pretend to be one designed for experienced VB programmers. The early chapters look like they are taken straight out of an ""Introduction to Visual Basic 6"" type book. The back half of the book is a listing of the Word Object model. The best parts are in the middle which show how use Word with an Access database among other things. There's no examples of using Word with a SQL 7.0 database (focus is on Access). The book needs to talk about the pros and cons of placing code in a Word template instead of a separate VB project."
5,Complete Study Of Using VBA Inside MS Word,"This book helps you transform Word into a database platform! It was the book that helped me write and distribute a patient database (electronic medical record, or ""EMR"") using fancy VBA techniques. I highly recommend it- there's no other book that comes close to the comprehensive nature of the author's writing."
4,Might need the DX for this one,"After downloading the sample to my Kindle, I realized that this was not formatted like a regular book. It is viewed like an image without the ability to scale up. Maybe it's just the trial version, but I do not know. Regardless, it is unuseable as it is."
4,"pretty nice, dries too quickly","I got this for our anniversary. They worked very well for massage, though they did dry rapidly, so I actually had to use more than I thought I was going to have to. They smell great, feel good, and if you're willing to pour it on, work well for massage."
5,Great Selection of Massage Oils,"This kit seems like a really good value to me - I really like all of the varieties, and a little goes a long way. This kit will probably last me several years, so I think I can splurge $20 or so for a luxury item like this every few years.The fragrances vary enough that you really can notice the difference. I can honestly see wanting to use all of them depending on what 'appetite' I will have when the time comes - not a dud in the whole kit!Enjoy!"
3,Smells good,I choose to rate this 3 stars because the oils don't spread to far and the scent seems to vanish quickly. Overall it is a nice product to use and the bottles sizes and packet are worth the price.
4,Solid B+,Thought the product was of very good quality. While I will continue to use this product some of the scents were not what I expected.
1,It doesn't work,"Either this is the wrong power adaptor for the keyboard [altho it is listed in the manual as 1 of 2 that work] or it doesn't work at all, but it does not power the keyboard."
4,Good book for learning TCP/IP programming,This is a good book for learning network programming especially from Microsoft .NET viewpoint. The book has extensive coverage of Sockets which is the standard API for programming with TCP/IP. I am teaching a new course on Internet Protocols and Client-Server Programming and I am thinking of adopting the book as a reference for the programming labs we do in the course. I have few minor shortcomings on the book which I will pass to the author directly but overall the book is very good.
5,Response to the person from Canada,"In response to :""I was hoping to find out how to code a server for a very high volume of client connections. The book explains how to use the ThreadPool, but that is only good for up to 25 clients per CPU...""Actually, there is a technique to handle hundreds of clients, but the way to communicate with them all requires them all to be in an array. Then, like in a merge sort algorithm, divide and conquer with separate threads working on each division, sending and receiving data. If you think this out, it would end up becoming a pretty well optimized way to handle this amount of workload. Hope that helped."
1,Matter of Honor,I ordered Matter of Honor by Linda Howard. I received A Matter of Honor by Stephanie Howard.
5,"The best there is, the best there was, the best there ever w","This by far has to be one of the best rap cd's from the 80's. As a matter of fact it is one of the best rap cd's even to this day, compared to what the 90's has to offer. The first time I heard a song from Schoollt D was while I was watching the movie THE KING OF NEW YORK. It stared Christopher Walken, Larry Fishburne, Wesley Snipes, David Caruso and minor parts with by Steve Buscemi. The movie is ""AWESOME"" the song ""Am I Black Enough For You"" is the one that is used durning the climax sceen in the movie. After hereing that sond I had to hear what else the artist of the song offered. Which lead me to Schoolly D and his album ""AM I BLACK ENOUGH FOR YOU"". The album is amazing there is not a single song on it that makes you want to skip to the next. In my time I have only come accross 3 other albums that I actually like every song on the album. Hope you will enjoy it as much as I have."
4,"Schoolly D, the forgotten gangsta rapper","I have 3 of Schoolly D's albums and there all very good. His album ""am I black enough for you"" combines old school rythem with a touch of R&B funk. Black Jesus is a very interesting song. Maybe Jesus is black after all!!!!!!!"
2,bad resolution,"Sorry, but the resolution is pretty bad on this poster. If you buy one it needs to be a big space."
1,"Hehe, got this for a lady friend as a practical joke.","She threw it at my head. :) This movie had a budget of approximately two dollars and seventeen cents. I'd call it an utter turkey, but that would be an insult to respectable turkeys everywhere. They did not use real actors for this, instead substituting cardboard figures controlled by string (Just like the Phantom Menace!) Ah, hell, why am I reviewing this? It's softcore porn and pretty terrible at it. The tickling scene isn't bad, though. Buy it for a practical joke like I did. :)"
5,The Best I've Come Across.,"This is the best of its type I've come across. I'm impressed. However the author doesnt address how you cope with idiots, and the system is filled with idiots: who run amok over the crime scene, destroying evidence; experts who know little or nothing about what they profess, severely damaging investigations; and political pressure to make certain outcomes likely. People get highly annoyed when your report is contrary to their bias and expectations. And newbie judges and lawyers. They arent scientists and they arent detectives, and they are arrogantly clueless when it comes to much of what you discover. This book is well-written, the author knows his stuff, and it's interesting."
4,Extremely interesting,This is an excellent overview of the forensic world. Very helpful reading before taking any forensic classes. Describes everything that goes on behind the yellow tape. The real story!
4,double check,"i just got the book and have not finished reading it so i may comeback to review my review later. actually, these are comments.on the first introduction page it referred to a old tv series ""Quincy M.D."". i was a big fan of that old tv series and i remembered it as ""Quincy M.E."" medical examiner not medical doctor. played by jack klugman.a quick search on the Internet for ""Quincy M.D."" a faq from www.inquire.net which explains why/how many people don't get the title of the tv show right. another search for ""Quincy M.E."" hits the jackpot.i am not suppose to include URLs so check it out for yourself. it is so easy to do this that i am surprise to find this little mistake in the opening pages."
3,da musiccman,"i own this cd. i noticed that amazon only show the cassette version, i would figure they have no idea that profile even pressed any copies of this on disc, or that nobody cares. well anyway, this group of guys must of got lucky or knew someone who worked for the label. the music is okay but this is the same label that had dana dane, you feel me."
4,Tracking and the Art of Seeing: How to Read Animal Tracks and Sign,"Got this book because it doesn't just cover tracks, but also discusses other signs and the animals' behaviors that might provide important clues. The book is too short to go into much detail, but nevertheless provides a lot of good pictures of the animals and their signs (prints on different surfaces, scat after eating different kinds of food, marks on the ground and on vegetation etc), and sketches of typical track patterns (including a lot of measurements). Two issues (and possible improvements for future editions of this book): The format of the book is more suited for browsing than for use as a quick reference, and there is no mention of some western favorites such as the Pika and Mountain Goats."
2,"Good, but not what I expected","This book is very good at helping you understand the animals that are in it. Most of them I could care less about. It mainly tells about the animals traits. For the animals I'm interested in I know all of this stuff. This book tells nothing about following tracks at all. It talks about gaits and patterns, and that's about it."
5,Excellent book,"This is a great book. I thought I was moderately experienced at tracking, but there were lots of things in this book that I didn't know or notice before. Easy to read, logically laid out, great photos and diagrams. Strongly recommend it to anyone interested in tracking"
3,Not What You Expect,"Judging by the title alone, I really thought this book would be part advice and part insight into making it as a screenwriter. However, I was pleasantly surprised to see it more of an inspirational book. Some are funny, others give an almost a poetic insight into their inspirtation. None, however give thier schedule or method of writing.It was also disapointing to see some of the writers go on an egotistical rant. Take note that the book is edited and not written by Lorain Tamara Elbert. There are no direct interviews but it seems a request by letter to contribute to the book and thus some have resulted in mini biographies of the screenwriter. On the upside, the black and white photgraphs are well done."
3,Get Into The Zone,"Billy Ocean's follow-up to his breakthrough album Suddenly again brought him to the upper reaches of the charts. The album contained two number one singles ""When the Going Gets Tough, the Tough Get Going"" and ""There'll Be Sad Songs (To Make You Cry)"". The former is an up-tempo, jaunty number that was originally featured on The Jewel Of The Nile soundtrack while the latter is another strong ballad. The title track is a smooth, continental sounding number that scratched into the top ten at number ten. The album would be his highest charting, getting up to number six."
4,Amazing covers!,"A bit on the jazzy/mellow side, these accomplished musicians take the beastie boys in a new direction!These are not just covers, but well thought out reworks of classics. The arrangement is far but ordinary, and for a lover of the b-boys and jazz, this is a must!"
4,Diverse heavy groove album that never gets old,This is probably my favorite techno album. Tracks vary from funk to somewhat ambiant. Highly recomended!
2,Wayne's 1991 collaboration a real mixed bag,"In which Wayne decides it's time to ... cover ""MacArthur Park,"" brothers and sisters (really!). To be fair, most of this album features Mick Ferren on vocals and songwriting, and the material mysteriously includes a re-release of ""Who Shot You, Dutch?"" (produced by Don Was) from their 1987 ""musical"" about gangster Dutch Schultz, as well as Ferren's spoken-word ""Death Tongue."" It's definitely a collaborative effort, though. ""Spike Heels"" and ""Fun in the Final Days"" are about as much Kramer as you'll get here, and even those were co-written by Ferren. Maybe Kramer was saving it up for ""The Hard Stuff,"" 1995's spectacular return to form featuring support from a whole generation of musicians inspired by the MC5."
3,The priesthood,"This is definitely a dark book that is not to be taken lightly. There are definitely group of people in this world that are convinced of a lot of this book's theories. However, if one does not study the how and why a goup of people came to their beliefs how can anyone hope to be guarded against them? This book really helps explain how biblical references and scriptures can be twisted to form any one groups agenda. I do not condone or belive any of the ideals in this book. It is essential that these types of books are available for research and the search for truth, and so that we can form our own opinion about what it has to say."
3,This is for LOW PROFILE PCs. Compare short appearance to normal profile,"This card is for low profile PC slots, not normal slots. Compare the side view appearance with normal cards. See the description of the card on the lavalink site. The lavalink site is the name plus a period and the usual domain ending for commercial sites. I can't write it out because amazon censors references to non-amazon sites."
3,Good card but metallic plate of the card much shorter for standard PC,"I gave 3/5 and not 5/5 for this card because of the following reason:My PC (Dell Dimension E310) didnt come with a parallel port, which I required for my parallel port printer (Xerox DocuPrint 4508) and this was the reason I bought this parallel port card.After receiving the card, I realized that the manufacturer of the card failed to mention or is not aware that the design of the card (ie the metallic frame installed that goes at the back of the computer) is too short for a standard PC.However, I managed to bypass this problem by carving the parallel port card outlet into the metallic plate that came with my computer and then installing the card.The card itself works perfectly fine but as I said above to be aware of the dimensions of the metallic plate, which is required to install the card, is much shorter in length than required to be properly fitted into the back of a standard PC."
5,A guide to an effective SCM Process,"Finding the path to the right process for your project and organization is tricky, and this book provides a map of the terrain that can guide you to the implementation appropriate for your project. This book will guide you through the steps that you need to take if you need to implement an SCM process for your organization at an organization, application, or project level. It includes customizable templates and examples to more quickly get you to your SCM goals."
3,Civil War at a regional level,This book is a non-military history of the cause and effects of the division of loyalities in Eastern North Carolina. This area was evenly divided between abolitionist and Confederates. General Burnside was able to raise a Division sized force of Black and White volunteers to help hold the East coast of North Carolina. Much of the terminology and many of the stories match those I heard growing up. This book is disappointing in that it does not include true military history. Those extraordinary events in Eastern North Carolina still wait to be told in a single comprehensive document.
5,Whodini The Kings of Classic Rap,"I am 29 years old and a male. When I was in about eighth grade or maybe it was seventh, I can't remember anymore, there wasn't much to do in a small town. All we had were comic books, atari, and WHODINI (thank you lord). I listen to Metallica, Megadeth, new stuff, I am broad in my music taste. However, I would put Back in Black by WHODINI on any top 10 list of mine. I guarentee you that you will love it. The beats and mixes and the rapping on this cd are original and the rhymes are just like WHODINI would call them........explicit!!!!!!!!!"
1,Ugly stand!,The finishing on the stand was horrible. The stand actually looked like it had been refurbished. I was not even able to use the stand for my 9ft umbrella because it could not sustain the weight of it.I did not return the item because the cost of shipping was not worth my money. I would not recommend anyone buying this stand.
1,Poorly constructed-pass on this one.,Screw knob on base was defective-does not hold umbrella securely or at the right angle. If not for the poor quality of the product--the price and free shipping would have made this item a great deal.
4,Sometimes difficult to read,"Teach Yourself Writing Fantasy & Science Fiction is more focused on the philosophies of writing instead of the actual act of writing. It depends on what a person is looking for.Mr. Stableford's own artistic science fiction/fantasy writing style seems to saturate the book, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It just makes the book as a non-fiction a little bit difficult to follow sometimes.I enjoyed his occasional touching on the subject of themes (or uses of certain themes) that have been over used in the history of Fantasy and Science Fiction. I also liked his discussions on how even though Fantasy and SF can take places in worlds very different from our own, there has to be some amount of reality or plausibility in them for a reader to understand and feel comfortable reading about it."
3,"good for writing, so-so for sci fi","This is a good book if you're not very familiar with writing techniques in general, but if you've taken even one college course in writing, forget it. I was hoping for more specific science fiction writing techiques, and was a little disappointed not to find them. If that's what you want, try another book."
3,How to write publishable Science Fiction and Fantasy,"As a beginning Science Fiction and Fantasy writer, I found this book severely dissappointing. It's not that it isn't a useful book, or that it's badly written; what I disliked, was that half the examples were telling you what you could and could not get away with rather than how to write high quality fiction and best captivate your readers. I went through the book constantly thinking ""Gosh! I could write better than this guy, what does he think he's going on about?""Despite that, there is still a lot that the beginning writer can learn from this book, and does give you a decent idea of what level you need to be at in order to get published. However, if you're looking to write at the best of your ability and come up with genuinely interesting plots, I suggest reading Orson Scott Card's book instead."
4,"A worthy resource, though somewhat hard to read","I consider Stableford as among the lower profile hallmark names in the sci-fi/fantasy industry, but he's been around long enough to be an authority on the topic. I have read a few novels and a short story of his recently, but I read this book before all those. Stableford's advice is extensive and used a lot of examples to illustrate points about speculative fiction writing. However, his book falls short in presentation because it uses a lot of continuous text, which can be tiring and monotonous for those whose attention control needs an extra kick. There is a lot to learn from this book, but its presentation could be greatly improved by using a graphic manner. There certainly are some perspectives and points about science fiction and fantasy writing that can be garnered from Stableford, though, so I don't think I wasted my P279. If you can afford to get this, do so."
4,Not bad - but not what I expected,"This cover is made of a plastic type material. Its not bad, but per the picture I was expecting a canvas type material. My mistake for not looking further. I have not had a chance to use it, but I looks like it will work okay. It was the best on for the price I could find on the net. Good luck"
3,A little disappointed,I order this cover before and the wind blew it away. The earlier version was much more sturdy than this replacement. A little thin and thus a bit disappointing. Otherwise functional.
4,Silky Smooth,"This and the rest of the bath bombs in the Lush collection leave your skin silky smooth. Ive used other bath products but these bombs leave my skin the silkiest ive ever felt. Whatever is in those bombs just envelops your body in a shell of silk, thats how it actually feels when you get out of the bath. Ive tried this bomb , the rainbow warrior and butterball. They all smell good and leave you feeling great. My only complaint is it takes a long time to recieve them. 4 stars."
3,It was ok,"overall, i wasn't that impressed. the scent was mild and i didn't get the relaxed feeling that many reviewers have experienced. i found it to be a neutral product. it did provide some relaxation but not the time to crawl in bed right now feeling i was expecting. i tub was a lovely light liliac color and mixed with the i should coco soap, it was a nice bath. nice, not out of the world which unfortunately is what i've come to expect from lush."
1,and Who Suggested this as being the Best bath Bomb ???,"I finally ! Finally purchase some Lush products after reading so much from other customers. Im a total Bath/Beauty Product Guru and I did not think these fizzy ball were in the least bit great. They Fizz yes. But Pretty much thats it. The smell is awesome when they are in the cheap little sandwich bag they come in but once you plop that baby in the Tub..it disappears and I wasnt impressed at all! Sorry Lush! Thank God I didnt spend an arm/leg on them. It was like soaking in Plain water w/this Bomb. I also got Honey Bee and same thing..No big Whoop!I wont purchase ""Lush"" Bath Bombs again. IT also takes to long for delivery."
3,Good mid-sixties Liverpool band,"I want to give this one 3.5 stars. The music on here is very representative of the beat sounds that were coming out of Liverpool circa 1963-64. The music is very enjoyable, however, at times, they come off sounding like a cover band. They variously sound like the Beatles, Peter and Gordon, the Swinging Blue Jeans, well, you get the idea. They were not one of the more consistent bands from Liverpool. I was pleasantly surprised to find some gems on here where the band seems to be forging their own sound and overall the band sounds quite good. I just come away feeling that they could have been better had they believed in themselves more and had access to better production and management. It must have been tough trying to make it in the shadow of the Beatles."
3,received wrong product,"the whole point of ordering this item was 2 handled cup for my 2yo. instead i received a set of 3 items, and a cup was regular. its a lovely set and i am to lazy to go to post, but this set was 40$ while 3pc set is $34, i wonder if amazon will reimburse the difference"
2,not what I expected,"I was very disappointed when I received the Bunnykins bowl and cup for my first grandchild, a boy. I thought I was ordering the racecar pictured on the web site and instead received a much less cute camping scene. The bunnies all look creepy as they have no eyes. Only one adult bunny has a very faint black dot for an eye. Made in Indonesia not Europe. Assume it is safe glazing but who knows?"
4,love,"i ordered two of these sets as shown for my daughters but i recieved one set as pictured, and one different set with the cereal bowl and plate and one handled cup. so...i did not get what i ordered, but i'm not complaining because it works fine for my girls. both sets are beautiful and functional. just be aware you may not get what exactly is pictured! too bad.i had a bunny bowl as a child and cherished it. these dishes seem to be of the same caliber quality and are really lovely."
3,The REAL Platters?,"Be wary with Platters ""hits"" albums. This is a group that did remakes of their rerecordings. (Was unable to determine if these are the original records or not.)PLAYLIST--(2:45) Only You(3:21) The Great Pretender(3:26) My Prayer(3:03) Harbor Lights(2:32) Smoke Gets In Your Eyes(2:45) Twilight Time(2:45) I Loved You A Thousand Times(2:43) With This Ring(2:59) I'm Sorry(2:42) The Magic Touch(2:20) Red Sails In The Sunset(4:59) Unchained MelodyTOTAL RUNNING TIME -- 36:20"
2,Not the original recordings... mostly.,"I checked this CD out from the local library purely to hear the version of Harbor Lights that I am familiar with, but can't seem to find on elsewhere. The good news is, this is the version I've been looking for! The bad news is, all the other cuts seem to be re-recordings, the lead vocalist seems to be completely different. I'm not a Platters expert, but I can surely tell these are not the classics you would expect if you purchased this disc. Steer clear, unless you're looking for the 3:03 version of Harbor Lights, which I think is original :)"
2,Rent it first,"I love Kate Clinton. I think she is fabulous. However, this particular dvd left me a bit flat. Parts of it were entertaining enough but overall I don't think it's worth the money. I would suggest renting it first and if you like it enough then buy it. Having said that, Kate is still one of my favorite comedians."
3,Fair at a reasonable price,I got what I paid for. Not as good as Canon ink and wouldn't use it for business docs but great for my secondary printer.
1,2-hour commercial for the left,"I didn't know this was a comedy, but I sure got some laughs out of it. The sad part is, it's true! This 2-hour commercial for leftist views was an obvious attempt to show that private acts do not affect public office (Bill Clinton). The characters condone abortion, adultery, illicit sex, etc."
2,Yawn,"I just thought it was boring. I don't know what all these other people are saying that it glorifies the Dems any. It seemed to me that it made all the politicians looks like creeps and swindlers - republicans as well as democrats. I just stared at the screen for two hours wondering when it would end so I could go do something else.For the record, Gary Oldman was amazing. None of his usual over the top acting, which was a nice change. The other actors also put in good performances. I just never could figure out why they bothered."
1,Really suspenseful if you've never seen a movie before.,"Joan Allen is her usual jaw-clenching, uptight self as the VP designate. When asked about falling for her own husband, she moans: ""Love is an involuntary reflex, and I fell victim to it."" Protagonists are more interesting when they display a pulse.And what a cartoonish bad guy Gary Oldman is for an allegedly serious movie. GASP! as he pads around the house in dorky pajamas. TREMBLE! as he wears a suit purchased from a Richard Dawson rummage sale. SCREAM! as he cunningly fails to return phone messages. But the one thing that really made me realize that this was one bad dude? When he gushed ""She's a looker!"" about Joan Allen's character. Yeah, Oldman's scary all right.There is one bright spot, but far too insignificant to save this picture--Sam Elliott, who steals the show as Bridges' profane, masterful chief of staff."
3,Dipicts the worst example of a Liberal progressive imaginable.,"Great performances by Bridges and Elliot. Joan Allen's character is Liberal progressive to the point of appearing brain damaged. For instance, she insists that an incident in which a room filled with people supposedly watched her take part in a sex train was ""a private sexual encounter"" and therefore nobody's business. She also says that not to give working mothers paid maternity leave is to penalize them. Apparently she doesn't think of the employer as being penalized when he/she is forced to pay someone for doing no work. She believes in having a strong military, not to protect the country, but to stamp out genocide."
2,50% believeable,"A nice fairy tale end. It might be a good idea, spoiled by a typical fairy tale end. Do not lose time watching at it."
2,Pretender Contender,"A movie of lofty ideals and passionate performances (especially by Joan Allen), that self-destructs in the last 15 minutes with a perfectly ridiculous ending. ""The Contender"" has the audacity to compare itself to classic political thrillers such as ""All the President's Men"" and ""The Manchurian Candidate"" (see the ""Making of . . "" featurette on DVD). It's not even in the same voting district. A major disappointment."
3,GIVE ME A BREAK,"Joan Allen plays the ultra-liberal ultra-principled Senator Hanson who refuses to defender herself against a sexual escepade (a gang bang) that, it turns out, never took place. The President, Jeff Bridges, gives what appears to be a state of the nation speech which is given over to nothing but his choice of her as vice president, nothing about forign policy, domestic policy, taxes, etc. Please give me a break.In the featurette it is ballyhood as a great political thriller equal to, say, ""The Candidate"" and ""All the President's Men."" What nonsense!It was nice to see Meryl Hemmingway and Mike Binder together in a film after their delightful lesbian sex romp, ""Sex Monster."""
1,Possilby the worst movie ever made.,"To the liberals who would accuse me of small-mindedness, think about the last discussion you had in the office with a loud-mouthed conservative. Did you enjoy the experience?"
1,Waste of time,"You've got to be kidding me. Is this supposed to be an ad for the liberal leftwing democratic(socialist) party? What a bunch of biased garbage. Don't waste your time on this one. Too bad, because I love Gary Oldman, or at least I used to."
1,Don't watch,"Terrible movie, don't waste your time. Very fake. It can't happen in real life this way. No value to this whatsoever. Worst movie of all time."
1,DVD - The Contender,"Purchased this item....had to return as it was defective. Got to the last few minutes of the movie and it stopped working. So consequently, I haven't been able to see the outcome of this movie."
1,Horrible and a ridiculous premise.,"This movie is horrible. Apparently it is up for an academy award but I don't see how. Clearly the people who nominated it haven't seen it yet. It is based on the ridiculuous premise that a man wouldn't be asked the kind of questions about their past that this women was asked so based on her principles she refused to answer them. I guess the writer, and everyone working on the film, never heard of Bill Clinton or Clarence Thomas! On top of that, this movie has very little action and an ending as ridiculous as the premise of the movie. I'd give it less then one star if I could."
1,zero stars - pure propaganda - not a movie,"zero stars - pure propaganda - not a movie JUST SOCIALIST, FEMINIST HOGWASH!!!! -----does hollywood think centrists are as stupid as they are???? VERY transparent."
4,"Oldman ,Allen & Bridges made the movie even better","A powerful political movie that`s will make ask your self this question "" which side i`m with ? "". A very strong acting performance , a good story , the movie has it all. If you like mystery , this one is what your looking for."
1,"Lurie trying to ""enlighten"" the unenglightened?","The liberal slant in this film was too blatant, it was offensive. I consider myself a social conservative and fiscal moderate. I hope to God that no pro-Choice, God hating, atheistic, ""anything goes because it's all about how you feel"" politician even gets a cabinet position let alone the VP or Presidency. It turns out that the Right was right about the nominee, just like the Lewinsky scandal."
1,I glad these people are not running the country,In this movie a President chooses a persons who is a husband stealing admited atheist to be Vice President but he likes her because of her strong pricnicples. I could see why people are upset with this movie and the messages it sends. Well thank goodness I rented and I only have to see this picture once. The acting is good but that is beside the point. To stand and conclude the picture on principle when the person in question is at best a mix bag of principles just does not ring true. To applaud is against my principles.
3,Depends on your point of view...,"...as to answering the question, ""will you like this movie?"". If you have liberal leanings, politically, you might very likely enjoy this movie. If you are of the conservative like, then you would probably not like this movie. If you can manage to take how you feel about politics out of your mind while watching this flick, you have great self thought control. Politics aside, this movie is not bad, though. I thought Jeff Bridges was likable and the rest of the cast did a better than decent job, acting. The writing, on the other hand, was at times ok, but at times a bit over the top (the final presidential speech, for example). If you sit on the left side of the isle, you will enjoy how conservative politicians are generally portrayed as hypocritical scum bags. If you sit on the right side of the isle, you will point to this movie as just another example of how the left mis-portrays conservatism to meet their own agendas. My rating is 2 1/2 to 3 stars"
3,"Good, not great.","Joan Allen plays the vice-presidential nominee who refuses to relent to the scrutiny of the media. It's an Oscar nominated performance but in the end a bit heavy handed. Not as entertaining as Wag the Dog or as suspenseful as Thirteen Days, it's an adequate political thriller, competently made."
2,An insult to my intelligence,"Pretentious and preachy script ruined the excellent premise and the first 30 minutes of intriguing beginning. I am a BIG fan of films on politics (just ask my wife), but this movie simply failed to deliver any subtlty and inspiration. As entertainment, it succeeded by having first rate actors executing well (Gary Oldman was wonderful as usual). But as a film of art, this movie was pretentious and simple-minded, and characters have black & white-like stereotypes with absolutely no convincing development. What a waste as I had such high hope and high expectation :("
2,Not really plausible...,"This film left me underwhelmed. I suppose the movie worked on a potboiler level, but the politics were pretty one-sided &the characters too one-note. There aren't really any moments in which the characters have internal struggles They all are pretty much set in their ways. No one seems morally torn by the issues at hand (unlike a film like ""Quiz Show"") this is fine, i suppose, but not as interesting as the material could be. Joan Allen was fine as Laine Hanson, but the character was underwritten. She has principles, I understand, but the way that the movie exonerates her is pretty ridiculous. She's as much a saint as Selma in Dancer in the Dark, but this movie has no sense of irony & expects us to accept her as is. Oh well...Particularly infuriating are Bridges' speech to congress & the following applause, but the film is filled with Capra-esque flourishes that simply don't work in a modern political film."
3,For Oldman fans only...,"Gary Oldman is my favorite actor, and he is GREAT in this film. His performance is 5 stars all the way. If you're a fan of Oldman, you will get a kick out of watching him eat up this role too. If you're not a fan of Oldman...or worse yet, if you're saying ""Gary Who? Did he sing that song 'Cars'?""...then stay away."
3,Not for Extremists,"Any movie about sex, politics, religion and society is going to garner extreme reactions from, well... extremists. In the case of ""The Contender"" the far left liberals may see this as a battle cry in their fight against all that is wrong in the world. On the other hand, the far right conservatives will probably see this as a _product_ of everything that is wrong in the world.However, those of us who are more 'centrally' minded will just see this as an entertaining, well-acted and well-made movie....and you have to realize that, whether or not you agree or disagree with it's answers, it's a significant question and ignoring it will not make it get better and will not make it go away."
2,Pretentious Liberal Preaching,"I expected to see a well made suspense thriller based on the description and the endorsements that are on the DVD cover. Well there's no doubt that those critics who gave the thumbs up for this movie lean far to the left. A hollow script portrays all Republicans as evil, scheming, women haters and Democrats are portrayed as righteous upholders of freedom. The story is so polarizing and pretentious that it lacks any credibility. The plot gets so ridiculous that the movie almost becomes a parody of the ideology that it tries to exalt.On the positive side, the acting and filming are good but it's not enough to make up for the corny and manipulative nature of the script."
4,an excellent political drama,"This is a fascinating story about DC-style hard ball, this time merging with feminism and sexual politics. Not only are the mechanisms of government well portrayed, but the ideals of this country are reaffirmed in a realistic way. I found this to be rivetting drama with some interesting surprises and some superb acting. In many ways, what is most interesting about it is what the VP nominee - a principled, shrewd and tough woman - decides not to do than what she ultimately does. None of it seemed wooden or formulaic to me, and it was not by any means a simple politically correct film. This is the kind of republic we have, for better more than for worse. In a time when I am extremely pessimistic, I found this moving and inspiring.Warmly recommended."
4,"Well Constructed, Pretty Good Execution.","This political drama profiles partisanship as it tears at democracy and the thought of a woman vice-president. The ending was supurbly written and executed, the remaining portions of the movie kept you involved particularly the confirmation hearings."
1,Horrible! Gross!! Thumbs down!!!,"Lots of political action ... too bad it has to be so biased. If you are a normal, decent American, you will hate this film because it puts down decency and morality at every turn. If the producers want the movie characters to play politicians who do not like to ""be in people's bedrooms"", then at least do it with some class. Have them say ""Americans have a right to privacy"", not something like 'You are the new version of McCarthy' or 'My past has nothing to do with my going for this job'. Sound familiar, America? (Hint: Clinton)"
4,Great Joan Allen flick,"After I saw this movie, the guy I watched it with and I had a huge debate over the movie's ending. I mention this to emphasize how thought-provoking this movie is. It will definately spark a nerve in women and prompt discussion.The movie follows a woman who is a contender for vice president but her candidacy is questioned due to a video allegedly depicting her in a non-virtuous light. Her response, and the response of those around her, makes a fascinating tale. Gary Oldman is the man you love to hate -- not because he seems to represent the moral right-wing, but because he's particularly vicious, and his politcal tactics will make you very uneasy.Thoughout this movie, Joan Allen is poised, with a hint of vulnerablility. Those who loved her performance in Pleasantville will enjoy watching her here as well.I thoroughly recommend this movie."
1,Horrible Film,"This movie was so terrible I couldnt stand to watch it after awhile. I was rather insulted that the lame speeches the president made in the film were coupled with rousing music and cheers from those playing the senators. I kept wondering If the writers of the movie really thought I would believe that nonsense just because they wanted me to. Anyway, there are far better movies to spend your money on besides this garbage. Too few that are better than this to name."
1,So bad,"This is an awful movie. The acting is so over-scripted -- and while the script is just sort of bad, not that bad, it has a good premise -- the acting is terrible. And I generally like these actors. And yesh -- YEEECH -- the ending, it makes it even worse. While the movie has a good cast and premise, all along it gets worse and worse. See it for yourself, if you want, but as the movie goes along it puts the toxic icing on the concrete cake."
1,...,"This picture started as a reasonably competent thriller. By the time Joan Allen delivered her closing speech at the confirmation hearing with the music rising,the absurd surprise plot twist, and Jeff Bridges' ridiculous call for a roll call, I had to apologize to my DVD player for being violated for the previous two hours. My only enjoyment out of this picture was an excellent performance by Jeff Bridges and a wildly over the top one by Sam Elliot. A film about the President (Bridges) probably would have been a better movie. What a load of hooey!"
1,Positive Garbage,"Before the opening credits roll, you can predict how this clunker will end. The Conservative will end up being a murderer, and the female candidate will be anointed Pope. Or at least vice (emphasis on vice) president.Of course, the Republican is the bad guy, and the Democrat is the Saint in this STUPID movie.This movie is a complete melodrama. Save yourself the money of buying this dog, and know that the female Democrat becomes VP. The Republican is disgraced (shocking...SHOCKING, i say) in this badly written, lamely acted ""behind the scenes"" yawn-o-rama of political ""intrigue"".Joan Allen shows precisely one emotion: stoicism. That's it. She's accused of being promiscuous--she's stoic. She's accused of being pro-abortion--she's stoic. She's accused of being a prostitute--she's stoic. BORING.Rotten movie. Save your money for anything superior. Perhaps ""The Hot Chick"". At least it's not boring."
3,If you have to watch a political movie........,"This movie will keep you interested whether or not you like politics or not. For a 2+ hour film I only checked the clock once or twice during a few slow dialogues. Granted the ending is predictable and Joan Allen's character seems to go a bit too far defending her point, the movie is watchable. Rent it, don't buy it."
3,President Lebowsky,"When viewed as an unlikely companion piece to The Big Lebowsky, this film is a hoot! I kept expecting the Presidential Chief of Staff to assure us, ""The Dude abides"". As a political story, it's OK, with a predictable twist at the end."
1,Good premise ruined by cheap dialogue and action,Anytime I see a potentially good film ruined by cheap and vulgar dialogue and by gratuitous references to sexuality I shut it off. So it was with this one.
3,Amoral 'reality' or objective Truth ?,"I had ordered the wrong format (in haste) but decided to give it to a film fanatic i know who still makes extensive use of VHS tapes. The film itself presents a polished ""honi soit chi mal y pense"" case for having an atheist (whose interpretation of the traditional separation between Church + State contradicts that of the US 'founding fathers' ) in direct line for the Presidency, at the top of our US executive branch. Excellent performances by fine actors show a jaded view of our government which takes the publicly amoral + the personally deceitful as 'givens', and encourages the viewer to accept the hopeless as ""reality"". Lots of ethical twists and sliding 'screens'. -Keep your Thinking-Cap on !"
3,We need more political Thriller,"I don't know why Hollywood is not interested in political thrillers. We are still talking about ""Wag the Dog"" and ""All President Men"". From this point Contender is filling the gap. The story of the film is great. Vice president was dead, President Nominees the female vice president. During the approval process political games were on stage. She stands for the right values. Especially for female viewers, this movie is inspiring. I enjoy the movie but it could be much better."
2,"it ""coulda been"" a great film....","""The Contender,"" pursuant to political intrigue and bias, could have been a great movie. It certainly had a fine cast. I hope we have such a film one day.Skipping over the far wing rhetoric on today's debates, there were too many holes in this film. As often the case of strictly armchair *authors*, the ends justify the means and to blazes with supportive/coraborative evidence/scenes. (i.e., the car incident, home movie, witness statements, live interview, etc..)A rewrite with informed consultants and a director with at least one foot in reality could go on to create a classic. Again, the premise and cast are fine. Perhaps the political machine mechanizations deserve better revelation as per trade-offs and compromises. While this attempt may be worthy of a look-see at a dollar cinema, I would tell a friend to reconsider adding it to their DVD collection. They can borrow my copy.:)"
3,"COMMON PLACE ""PATRIOTIC"" MOVIE...","THE CONTENDER has a first-class cast, no doubt about it. THe guys are really good.But the history goes predictably into the good x evil cliche, where the Presidente is too perfect, OLdman is too bad."
2,makes me mad,"this movie makes me sooooooooo mad because it could have been a good film. But turning the Oldman character into a caricature, falling for the lame ending, ugh. could go on. Hated it."
2,Pretty bad,"The Contender is almost a joke at times. The script is pretty poor, the acting is bad, it's just weird watching the woman jog through the cemeteries, and the premise was just unbelievable. The worst part was the president giving the speech at the end. What kind of president would give a speech like that? Even the parts in it that were essentially porn weren't that great. The only reason it gets two stars is because of the plot twist at the end. All in all, though, it was a waste of film."
1,Horrible,"Lord knows there are plenty of movies and television shows for conservatvie Republicans to use as a whipping post for Hollywood's left leaning ways, but The Contender is a movie that is so bad, so self-righteous, so utterly unbelievable, that it'll offend and anger just about anyone. The first thirty minutes of the film, which would have been totally dead had it not been for Gary Oldman, lays all the groundwork for what looks like to be an engrossing, thrilling movie. But as the clock ticks, you quickly become disgusted, and by the end (especially the scene with the 'President' portrayed by Jeff Bridges addressing a joint session of Congress) you feel like hurling your remote at the television.The idea was solid, but the movie just gets it all wrong. ""A First Rate Thriller"" it's not."
4,nice book,"It's a cute book but definitely not as nice as ""Daddies are for catching fireflies"". This one lists al the great things a child does with his mommy but they're not all fun....saying please, stopping when mommy says so...daddies were all about fun."
2,"Mommies get to have fun with the kids, too!","Okay, so admittedly, this is a quibble from a tired mom, BUT: why is it that while in the other books in this series, Daddies and Grandpas get to do fun loving stuff like play ball and go to the movies, but Mommies are busy driving kids places and cleaning them up? Maybe that IS reality, but it's only part of reality! This mom would love to see the Mommies in this book getting to do more fun things -- paint pictures, make snow angels, bake cookies, roll down hills in the grass -- with the kiddos. More fun for Moms! We need it, and kids need to see us having it, and not just associate us with having their faces wiped and being put to bed..."
2,"Cute, but FAR too stereotypical!","My own mother bought this book for my son recently (along with ""Daddies are for Catching Fireflies,"" and although I initially thought they were cute books, I quickly changed my mind after actually reading them. According to this book, Mommies are for fixing boo-boos, making breakfast, driving kids around, and my personal favorite ""TAKING CARE OF EVERYONE!"" While this may be the reality in many households, I don't think these are concepts that need to be reinforced in a book. I find this book particularly annoying when contrasted with the Daddy version, in which Daddies apparently fix broken toys (I'd love to see my husband fix anything that's broken...he's got NO mechanical sense), ""GO TO WORK,"" read books ""and fall asleep, too."" These books might as well have been written in the 50s. Needless to say, these books will only make an appearance in our house when Grandma comes to visit, and only then because they were a gift. Save your money...don't buy these books."
2,Very traditionalized book,"The book itself is cute, with nice flaps that my son enjoys lifting. The pages are not a board book, but heavier than paper so you don't have to worry about the baby breaking the book.I received this book and the companion book, Daddies are for Counting Stars. The daddy book is adorable, it's all about how great daddy's are, how they do all these fun events with you. Then I read the mommy book. It goes into how mommy's give you baths, how they cook, how they teach you manners. I hate how these books display the traditional fews of a mother and a father. I don't want my son to be so closed minded."
4,"I want these days back again, NOW","Way back in the days when rap was inventive and meant something, there was Kool Moe Dee. Blowing the roof off of nearly every other rapper around. Always taking the high ground, never stooping to gangsta posturing or pretty-boy posing, he came at you with an amazing ability to rhyme and poignant subjects that make today's rap look just plain silly. It's a shame rap had to be co-opted by tough-guy-wannabes and pointless airheads, because Moe Dee could still be topping the charts today. A forgotten legend."
4,KMD ON POINT......,"This,too me, is Kool Moe Dee most complete LP. Sure 'How ya like me know, had it good cuts, Funke,Funke wisdom ditto, but this LP was on point. It's conscious lyrics, great production(mostly Teddy Riley)are worth the price alone. Tpo cuts are: They want Money,The Avenue, I go to work, Knowledge is King, and pump your fist. Go enjoy."
5,Oh So Soothing...,"'Guardians of Atlantis' is a beautiful album to listen to when you want to get to sleep because the gentle sounds of the ocean and of the tropical island streams meld perfectly with a nice, deep breathing.When I listen to this album I am able to picture the shore of Kaua'i...with the large waves and sounds of gulls as they soar in the powerful air currents.The piece called ""Caribbean Air"" truly allows you to breath in a piece of tropical air...you can feel the sweet moisture in the air.It's also a treat to hear the Humpback Whales sing on track #5...their song is part solemn and joyful at the same time.As an end note, the sound of the violin works well on this album--creating a mystical effect."
2,It's okay,"It's good to have, and I'll keep it, but so far (and I'm about to give up), all I like by this guy is Prufrock - and that I love. It's what made me buy the book. The short poems are oblique or boring and usually both. And the whole thing reeks of his Christianity and his apparent desire to be British. He uses more British slang and place-names than any native-born Brit I ever read! He's old enough to use rhymes and have a feel for rhythm - Prufrock certainly has these qualities. And if it weren't for these two things, I wouldn't read another word. I'm looking forward to the plays - only one of which I've read (""The Cocktail Party""). Particularly Cathedral."
1,worst ppv ever just so so bad,my god this sucked the matches all of them were awful the running time was only 1hour long theres no extras on this dvd and only 6 matches if you want to call them that i use to be a huge fan of wew not after watching this show on the good side of this dvd very few and in bewtween the main event was ok it's there verison of a hardcore match the opening scene was funny of were they had the owner looking over new talent a very soft porn music video with a very hot blonde on the beach besides that don't waste your money or your time on this all the action and great matches are gone theres no tie weed or gi ho whitch is the reson to buy any wew dvd they replaced them with no talent skanks they have really gone down hill with this release awful awful just so so bad half a star you want wew go to the younger years
3,I think this is censored,"I bought this because I was looking for ab original version of ""donkey skin.' I read a novel ( ""Deerskin"") based off of the aforementioned story a number of years ago and have been looking for an original unedited version ever since. I don't think the version in this collection meets that criteria."
2,Ministry Of Sound....,This is a pretty good mix by a couple of Australian DJ's. I think you'll get your money's worth. Both CD's have really good tracks and the Mixing is good too especially CD two mixed by Jason Midro. Check it out. You can't go wrong.
3,American Beauty,"Well, it was certainly interesting. The movie captures your attention quickly with Kevin Spacey's statement that he will die. Throughout the movie several possibilities are presented to the viewer as to who will murder him. The plot isn't very realistic, but I don't believe it was meant to be. The drug abuse, the troubled teens, troubled marriages and etc. are all thrown together for exaggerated dramatic effect. Good and amusing movie."
1,Pointless piece of junk,"This [junk] beat out The Cider House Rules,The Sixth Sense, Snow Falling On Cedars and The Green Mile? American Beauty is the pointless tale of a man going through a midlife crisis who gets killed at the end. Everyone in the movie is boring and unhappy and this movie has ABSOLUTELY NO POINT AT ALL."
1,Overhyped and overrated,"Okay, so its not that bad, but if you expect a genuine classic in the vein of Schindler's List or Shawshank Redemption, then you'll be disappointed. The film includes some important adolescent issues, but then so does 'She's All That', and every other high school drama. It certainly glamorises drugs, as the characters never receive any ill effects in the film's duration. Even 'Trainspotting' managed to address the dangers of drugs. Worst of all is the ending - a tacked on who-dunnit that doesn't blend into the rest of the story. If American Beauty had not won Best Picture, I wouldn't be quite so critical about it, but the Academy really should have gone with The Insider or Being John Malkovich."
2,"What exactly is your beauty, America?","As always Kevin Spacey does a great job but in my opinion it doesn't deserve an Oscar!Oh yes after you see the movie, you know that such stories usually get Oscars. But no one can understand why! If you analyze the movie deeply you'll see that it has to do with Hollywood stereotype against a specific type of discrimination! This is becoming the ""American Beauty"" trend since the early 90s!I give one Star for good acting + one Star for a nice way of telling a bad story with a shocking tragical ending... that is all!"
1,I love it... because they told me to.,"I believe the only reason anyone thought this movie is good is because they were told to. It gave a very good illusion that it was saying something new or, at least, very, very deep.. but in reality it was just a stereotypical drama that told you which direction to go in... and of course, because we are so used to being lead this way or that, we go there. We say how deep it was and we say, ""How true. How true."" It's too easy to pull something off like American Beauty. It looked real pretty.. but other than that, I was disapointed.And, if you do happen to enjoy Kevin Spacey's performance, maybe you would like to watch ""The Ref"", ""Swimming with Sharks"", or ""The Big Kahuna"" becuase he plays the same exact stellar role in all of them."
2,Very Average GARP REVISTED&Jerry Springer,this is one of the most OVERRATED FILMS EVER.TRUE Kevin Spacey did a Good Job but not Enough To Rewarded over DEnzel Washington.I have seen this Movie Before it was Called THe World According To Garp.Annette Bening was SOlid as well.this film reminded me of Jerry Springer as well.with alot of Twists&Turns.it has alot of Cliches all over it.the Direction was Good.People are Dysfunctional No Matter what their Status is in Life Period.that's Nothing New.this FIlm didn't break any New Ground in any way.SOme Good Performances but Way Overrated&Predictable in alot of Spots.COmpared Too Garp this is Tame.RObin WIlliams was One Step Above Kevin Spacey&He did His Film Nearly 20 Years Back.this is just a Shrewed REMAKE.
1,What's the big deal anyway?,"This would DEFINATLEY have to be on the the top 5 list of the worst movies I've ever seen. I mean, what stupid idiot would want to go and see a movie about some middle aged jerk chasing after a 16-year-old girl? To me , this movie is just a take-off Lolita, and the only type of award it deserved was a golden respberry for ""worst movie of the year."""
4,AMERICAN BOOTY....,"Some serious eye candy in this movie! I liked the story to thismovie, it was good, and different. Kevin Spacey was great, asusual, and the two teenage girls, were sexy and easy!"
1,Very bad energy,"Wow...Based on the reviews I thought this would be a good movie, perhaps a great movie. Folks it isn't. It's like taking a trip to the dump, garbage in every direction. Unbelievably gross and repugnant human beings. Foul language abounds as do hateful people without morals or values. I didn't even make it to the half-way point of this film yet the extreme bad vibrations stayed with me for a good long while afterwards. Do yourself a favor, stay away from this cesspool."
4,A movie worth watching,"American Beauty brings to the screen the story a middle-aged man who is not really in control of his life or his happiness, until he decides to finally take matters into his own hands. That's when changes begin to take place, but as the saying goes, when it rains, it pours...I have to admit I liked this movie much more the second time round.Kevin Spacey and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least. All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is something else)! Very well written and very well presented, the film does a great job of describing people's every day lives and the problems they face.The only major setback is in relation to the hidden and not-so-hidden messages found throughout the movie.In short, American Beauty is a movie definitely worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment!"
3,Where are the outtakes?,"How cruel to mention the outtakes several times during the commentary by Sam Mendes and Alan Ball, and yet not to include them in the DVD. What were the publishers thinking?Anyway, great movie, worth buying the DVD, but where are those blasted outtakes?"
5,A HOT SIZZLING LOOK AT LIFE!,"This is a hot sizzling look at life. One moment you're looking at a ""perfect american Mom, Dad, Daughter- apple pie in the sky smiling photogenic family"" in suburbia, then POW! the action and the ""games"" begin. High-powered money making agressive realtor Mom (Annette Bening) dominates temporarily, wimpy laid back inept Dad (Kevin Spacey). Their daughter, caught between these two is equally unhappy. Enter the cheerleader. This film is startling, shocking, graphic. The characters undergo major transformations. You will gasp and laugh, maybe, as they unravel before your eyes. Dad starts building those muscles and Mom---- No I won't tell you everything. See the film. It's adult, entertaining, humorous, provocative. No wonder it won all those awards. Excellent cast. Fantastic script-writing. Visually perfect."
4,american beauty,"American Beauty objectified women by a panoptical regime by the way Ricky's camera. Panopticism is when a person doesn't know if they are being watched, but always have the feeling like they are being watched. Through Ricky's camera, Ricky is the surveyor, while everyone else is the surveyed, which is how beauty is defined. The movie both reproduces stereotypes and critiques them as well. It reproduces stereotypes because Angela is the attractive blond cheerleader, who thinks she's the best, but in reality is fake. It critiques stereotypes because Carolyn isn't your stereotypical housewife, who cooks and cleans. Carolyn also breaks the stereotype of men cheating on women, when she has a fling with her competition. Overall its a weird but interesting film."
2,Another cliched look at Suburbia.,"Yes, everyone is having some type of crisis in this movie, after all they live in Suburbia don't they? The actors do a good job with the material provided, but the script is so loaded with cliches that no amount of acting ability can bring the characters to life. 'The Ice Storm' provides a more detailed (and believable) look at suburban families in crisis. 'American Beauty' on the other hand tries to substitute cynicism for insight. This is pretty commonplace these days. It gives screenwriters the chance to congratulate themselves for 'deep' material and film critics the chance to use terms like 'dysfunctional family'. It doesn't make a great movie however. Worth a rental if you haven't seen it, just to see what the buzz is (or was) about."
4,Wanted,"Hello, I am a teacher of English in Germany and I am planning to talk about the movie American Beauty in class. This is why I am looking for English-speaking people (preferably [American] teenagers aged 17-19) who would like to take up an e-mail correspondence with my pupils in order to talk about the movie.I believe that it will be a very rewarding experience for my pupils to get in contact with you.If you are interested in finding a friend in Germany and/or in talking about American Beauty, please contact me as soon as possible.Here is my e-mail address:niqui@t-online.de"
3,Good...but not Oscar worthy,"I think this film was overappreciated. Yes, some parts were original, nicely shot, yes, there was some good acting, but darl comedies have been better filmed before, like ""Happiness"" for example. And I always thought Bening's performance was overrated. I think she's a competent actress but I've seen her to better effect elsewhere. However this is not entirely her fault, for I feel her role was underwritten and one dimensional. Spacey is adequate, I guess. I don't know, it just didn't bowl me over. Darn depressing, too."
4,Look Closer,"This is a film that has, after only four years since its release, has lost its edge and thus has aged badly."
5,Tragic America,"American Beauty is a psychological satire about the life of middle class white suburbia. Never has a movie a movie gotten away with projecting some much. It's an ode to family dysfunction, mid-life crisis, neurotic mother/wives, homosexuality, and screwed-up teens. Yes, this is one for the Prozac generation, the MTV kids and their parents, it's so cutting edge and so mean it's hard to believe it received its much deserved Oscar. It's just as complicated as the neverous breakdown it displays. It's an attempt at holding a mirror to America, making America vomit at its deceitful image, and then allowing America to say to itself ""Like, I'm like so cool."""
1,Ordinary People for 2000,"This really is a dreary little film. In years to come it will be remembered just as Ordinary People is today, one that swept the awards boards back then, by now has absolutely no bite whatsoever. The acting is horrible, the script very weak, the directing very dull (Mendes should stick to running his theatre in London, though shouldn't direct anything there again). All in all a waste of time. I would say I'm surprised at the response of the general public to the mess that is American Beauty, but then that's the power of the media for you: they tell us what's good, most people believe them. Please start thinking for yourself people. Please."
1,A hateful piece of filmmaking,"This movie is so hateful, so loatheful of human existence that it's the most painful experience. The writer obviously hates women because The Annette Bening is such a stereotypical picture of women. She should wear a sign that says, ""What she needs is a really good shag."" That's about as subtle as the writer is with her character. Kevin Spacey again shows why he is the worst respected actor working today. It's the same performance he has given in every one of his movies. This guy's act never changes. Skip this overbloated piece of manure."
3,"Pseudo-intellectual, but still a good flick.","I did not see this movie when it was in theaters, despite the recommendations of my peers. Recently, I finally got a chance to see it after it had been completely over-hyped. I found it to be a very high-quality film. Brilliant acting, excellent cinematography, and a rasor-sharp script made the movie extremely enjoyable. However, reflecting on the movie as a whole, American Beauty is actually more of a mainstream wannabe-intellectual movie (although I have to say that Fight Club takes the cake in terms of mainstream indie movies). To put it quite harshly, I believe that American Beauty gives the lesser intellectuals something to latch to and praise. The beauty of the film hides its weak social commentary very well. So well, in fact, that it picked up a horde of oscars and gained a quasi-cult following."
3,A view from afar ...,American Beauty is about an over privileged society wallowing in self pity and neurosis in a way that could only be of interest to the wallowers themselves.
1,Kevin Spacey 1 star/The rest of the movie was INSULTING!!,"I purchased this movie in hope that I would be receiving a 5 star movie. This movie was a great idea if you cut out Lester's fantasy of his daughter's best friend & his wife screwing around. This movie is obviously not intended for children to even be in the room. It was insulting to see Spacey so hung over a girl that he could have had as his daughter. I enjoyed Spacey's comedy that he added to the movie but, other than that you may just want to pass this one up. It is very over rated in my book. Don't let me be the judge though. Sorry to the people who love this movie but, I DO NOT recommend."
1,One Star for Direction,"The director deserves credit for the usual things a director must do to complete a movie. And my accolades stop there.This is, on my personal list, the #2 worse movie I've seen in the last 10 years. If you are a person of morals and think Hollywood is morally bankrupt and celebrate their immorality then this movie is proof of that belief. It is a microcosm of liberalism where all the ""hero"" or ""good"" characters are disfunctional (drug users, adulterers, liars, blackmailers, voyeurs, etc). This movie won Best Picture for one reason -- payback for Forrest Gump which was widely hated by the Hollywood elite for it's virtues. Watch at your own risk, but be wary of impressionable children and teenagers watching."
2,American Beauty is not Pretty.,"This is a disturbing film. The Academy Award judges(who are so far removed from middle class America) were convinced that this represents America and picked it as best picture. At the same time, the movie going audience who are probably the same people who worship televsion shows like Jerry Springer and Jenny Jones spent their money to watch a rehash of what they like to watch on tv. It's hard to make heads of what the point of this movie is about except that middle America is really screwed-up. One goes to the movies for escapism, and not to be reminded of how bad and dangerous real life can be. The producers, writers, director probably knew the same kind of girls I knew in high school, because their portrayal in this movie nails it right on the head."
1,WHAT is the BIG DEAL?,"I absolutely cannot believe that this movie won an Oscar. This has convinced me to never watch the Oscars again since it is obviously a ""political"" organization. This movie was just dumb AND disgusting in its semi-pedophilic theme. I am not a prude but I could hardly stomach Kevin Spacey's behavior. With all the discussions about ""family values"" I was also disappointed with the complete lack of reverance in this family and their attempt to spoof (which fell flat,by the way). I am tremendously thankful I did not waste my money at the theatre. Wasting my money on a rental was bad enough. This was the WORST movie I have seen in a very long time."
1,MPAA and AMPAS must be crazy,"AMPAS is nuts giving ""American Beauty"" the Oscar for Best Picture. The MPAA is nuts giving ""American Beauty"" an ""R"" rating. If anything, this movie should be rated ""NC-17"". This movie was too much to handle, even for a ""see-anything-once"" moviegoer like me. I mean, over-the-top black comedy, bare breasts and masterbating sequences makes this movie all the more unfair for its rating. And the ending was so bloody and disturbing, I could barely lay my eyes on the screen. There are many people out there who should NOT see this movie; if you are anywhere under 18 or the type who cringes just by pouring ketchup on your fries or taking off a calculator cover, I recommend to the highest extent you not see this movie. This is unacceptable material to hit theatres or video, it strays far from it's innocent image. Whatever age you are, don't see this movie. You'll be glad you didn't."
1,This Just Shows How Low Movies Today Will Get!,"Though the acting & directing were suberb the plot was crude, disgusting, & not a movie to spend one cent on. My brother, friends, & cousin went to see this movie as a group because of the great ratings. By the middle of the movie we had lost three members of our group who had bought tickets to another film. The film which was originally a teen flick turned out to be a 5 time Academy Award winner & went to become one of the most hated movies of 99. If I had a choice to watch water trickle down a porch or this movie I choose the water."
2,Right is wrong? Wrong is right?,"4 stars for the crisp cinematography, flawless performances, and incomparable artistry.0 stars for the mindless message.Poor Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey). Society pushes him to the breaking point and then punishes him for breaking. Can't a guy just be left alone to pursue his own depravity (taking drugs, having sex with children) and not have to worry about responsibility? This is all ""the man's"" fault. ""Yuh know whut I'm sayin', mofo?""Mean old capitalism."
2,Rip Off,This movie was good but it rip off one of the best movies of the 90'es a film called Happiness. A brillent protray of the dark side of Suburbia. I will admit American Beauty had better photography but thats about it there are so many things the same with both movies. The only two difference is Happiness came out a year earler (thats why its riping it off) and Happiness is way more contreversail and is for adults only before you watch American Beauty watch Happiness than you decide.
3,"See it, but don't believe it.","Though it may not be a great film, American Beauty is quite a good movie and I recommend seeing it. It's lushly photographed and well acted. It has an entertaining and unpredictable plot. All this is true, but it may be the most manipulative film I have ever seen. It is as if American Beauty is taunting its audience, ""I can make you see or feel anything thing I want! I can even make you believe you are being manipulated!"" American Beauty is the Penn and Teller of movies: it's like an illusionist pretending to debunk illusionists. It will use you then intentionally make you feel used.Certainly, you should see and enjoy this film, and the DVD is well worth owning, but remember this: a roller coaster is not a bus and will not take you anyplace useful."
5,Absoulte Beauty,"American Beauty is the most perfect film ever made.Direction is perfect,Script is gorgeous,Perfomances are mind blowing and Kevin Spacey is on top form once again. This sould be garenteed OSCARS and hopefully will be! 1"
5,Nothing Short of Amazing,"This film had ""Dreamworks"" written all over it ... IT IS A BEAUTIFUL FILM. It certainly deserved every Academy Award it got, and was one of the most deserving ""Best Picture"" award-winners of the decade. It is a dark-spirited film, but is yet a mesmerizing drama. Final word? If you can buy it, buy it."
4,How to write a script.,"If the screenplay for American Beauty had been submitted to one of those many silly contests (where they take your fee and give you nothing), it would have lost. It has voice overs, you see, and cardinal rule one of writing movies is no voice overs. Rule two is no voice overs. And so on.Anyway, forget the rules. The prose in American Beauty is stunning, the observations of small moments in American life trenchant. No, this movie doesn't answer all the big questions, or maybe any of them. And, yes, it does drip with a lot of silly Hollywood attitude (like the observation that those who oppose homosexuality must be closet gays, or worse). What this movie does well is provide a snapshot into a real life (Kevin Spacey's), and gives us a lot to chew on about what passes for living in modern America. It is, at its heart, a story about the difference between society's expectations and our inner lives. And about finding ways to break free of those expectations."
2,Nothing New,"I was not impressed with this movie despite its rave reviews. The topic is nothing new. The treatment of the movie's serious theme did not grab me. Ok to pass an idle afternoon away. There have been just too many dysfunctional family movie themes, and I'm bored to death. For instance, it is similar to The Story of Us. Americans have a way of going over and over their own neuroses like a broken record. Just like the endless reams of Vietnam war movies and books. At some point, you've got to snap out of it, and move on. The movie did not change my life nor improve my outlook. Would like to see a newer, fresher and more original movie."
2,A Daria episode after a lobotomy,"How do you win a boatload of Academy Awards? Just use this formula: 1. Pretentious dialogue. 2. Banal symbolism. 3. Overacting to the point of earnest emotional farce. Unless you enjoy the ""Angst Ridden Overprivileged White People With Problems"" genre of films, then this film isn't for you. Funniest moment that wasn't supposed to be funny: Annette Benning's emotional breakdown following her merciless cleaning of a house she was showing. While there are plenty of cultural products that elucidate the boredom and banalities of suburban life (like Daria on MTV and the music of Sonic Youth), this movie fails in the delivery of its message. Instead it wallows in its own diminished self-worth. Boomer navel gazing has never been so funny. Like I am supposed to care for any of these characters? At least the characters on Daria are appealing."
2,profound?!?!,"maybe - for a hallmark card or a pepsi commercial. it's eyecandy for emotional ...; .... people who like this movie are probably postmodernists, don't understand chess, and weep profusely with the slightest tinge of reality. this isn't dramam and there are no characters but sick people. it would only get one star, but it's better than magnolia."
2,Can't Figure Out the Hype,"The only reason I gave this two stars, and not one, is I was intreged enough to watch it all the way through, though it took me two settings to complete it. The reason I had to watch it in two settings is because is was so completely depressing and going nowhere. I was really annoyed by the Father who was love w/ a teen, (and not with his wife), the hysterical wife, and the doldrum daughter. The whole family wouldn't give the time of day to each other. The disturbing way the Colonial treated his son and others was also not inspiring. Really, I can't remember when I was so depressed watching a film. I was puzzled beyond belief at how this movie recieved such possitive attention."
2,"overhyped, forgettable star vehicle","Basically, this movie is of the kind that the critics told us we were supposed to love because Big Media wanted another excuse to fawn over Spacey, Bening, and ""discovery"" Suvari.American Beauty is an occasionally pretty movie, but the story is just stupid and pointless, the characters are uniformly unlikable (either big jerks or shrinking wimps), and the sloooooooow directing is definitely a love-it-or-hate-it style. (I hated it.) Definitely a rental."
2,Not my type,"I have to say honestly that this movie upset my stomach. I know that many will say that the symbolism and lighting among other production qualities were magnificent, but when you get right down to what the characters are doing--the plot, I was pretty disgusted. The dream scenes and the reality scene were basic child molestation. I believe this movie was nothing more than art for art's sake. I liked the music, but found the story to be very cold and distant, definitely not a touchy-feely-feel-good kind of movie. I find it disturbing that a film with the subject matter as this one has won top honors."
3,Probably the most astonishing thing,"about this film is either a) its openness to, or maybe naked appropriation of, the gestures and preoccupations of avant-garde film or b) the fact that you could view American Beauty as the most expensive piece of teen porn produced in 1999. Not only do you get the nice visual haiku of the spinning trash, which halts all narrative motion--a sin in Hollywood film--but the director actually exploits both young girls. Stripping two teens is a B picture coup if I've ever seen one (no different, I'm sure, than sitting through a screening of ""Masked Avenger Vs. Ultra Villain in the Lair of the Naked Bikini,"" also released in 99). So you get both, high art and low. Of course the high art moment is rendered with garbage and the trash-movie scenes are accomplished through use of the nude. Go figure. This is postmodernism, after all."
5,...is a joy forever,"The best film of 1999 was the decade's last great entry in the genre it will become known for: the black comedy. Deserving of its place alongside ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Fargo,"" Sam Mendes' transcendent ""American Beauty"" chronicles the Burnhams, a suburban American family drowning in their own polished miseries. Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Wes Bentley and Thora Birch all shine in this astute, clever, and ultimately moving tale of the dangers of trading our loves for our lusts and forsaking that which is truly important. ""American Beauty"" finished out a renegade decade for world cinema in high style."
2,Not Oscar worthy! Over-rated!,"First of all, I think that it's pretty sad that a movie about a disfunctional family would win an Oscar for Best Movie! Now that I got that off my chest...I've seen 4 of the 5 movies that were nominated for Best Movie of 1999. Out of the 4, American Beauty was by far at the bottom of my list. I strongly feel that The Green Mile or The Insider should have won, followed by The Sixth Sense. I've watched American Beauty twice, and if it weren't for Kevin Spacey, then I probably wouldn't have ever seen it. Kevin Spacey is by far one of the best actors out there. His brilliant performance as Lester makes this average movie worth watching at least once. He definetly steals the show! Other then that, in my opinion, this is an average movie. There was nothing exciting or climactic in the movie. The best part of the movie had to be the last 15 minutes of the movie. Everything throughout the movie all came to one."
5,"My Two Cents--See It Again, and Again...","...and again. I avoided comment about this because I did not want to sound like another viewer who was hyped up about it because it won all the Oscars. Nevermind all the hype, see for yourself and judge for yourself. I did and I think it is one of the best movies put out in a long, long time. I fail to see how it is greatly similar to ""..Garp.."", the movie or the novel. Maybe both Garp and Beauty requires some introspection on the part of the viewer/reader to see each story's uniqueness and beauty. Some folks, unfortunately, would rather not do that, its not one of the easiest things to do. It's easier, like the film subtexts, to find error and faults. It's those folks who don't really 'get it'..."
2,What was all the hype?,"Once again, the Oscar hype has taken a sub-par film, and rocketed it to popularity and success on the backs of two of today's best actors. Kevin Spacey once again delivers an award-worthy performance, and Annette Benning is superb as his emotionally eratic wife, but that's where the kudos should end. Not since The English Patient has a film been so disappointing and unworthy of all the attention and praise it has received. This dark, tragic tale of midlife crisis fails to deliver and plods along with teasers of a climactic finish, only to finish the same way it began....slow. Look for a great performance by Kevin Spacey, as always, but your time and money would be better spent on any other of his movies. The Usual Suspects is a perfect example. Steer clear of this one unless you believe all the hype and irrationality once again shown by the Academy"
4,American Beauty Rocks,"This movie was the best movie of the '99 year. For once the Oscars actually got it right. The movie is about family, and aging, and the things that motivate people. Lester Burnham (Spacey) is having a mid-life crisis of sorts where he realizes that his marriage is empty, his relationship with his daughter is severely lacking. That's when his youthful next door neighbor opens his eyes to the real wonders of the world. This is an incredible movie with awesome performances handed down by all the actors. At times funny, at times touching, this movie is a true must see. The DVD presentation of the DVD is decent. The commentaries are informative, the picture and sound are excellent. Most of the documentaries on the disc are closer to fluff and probably not something you'll watch over and over, and enough time is spent talking about the cutscenes that one would have hoped that they made it onto the disc. Still, this movie does sell itself and comes with very high marks."
4,Nuts,I really enjoyed this movie. I like the way that it really took you into these people's lives and exposed you to a level of perversion that you don't get to experience from the outside. I'll admit that the first time I saw this movie I wasn't quite sure what all the fuss was about but the more I watched it the more enamored I was with the whole concept. It really makes you want to take a look at your own neighborhood and wonder what is going on out there. Definitely deserving of all the praise.
1,"Below average movie, definitely not best picture material","When I saw the oscar nominated American Beauty months ago, I expected a very fine movie with talented actors like Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening. Instead what I found was a very bland, often wierd film about a man named Lester (Spacey) going through a mid-life crisis. Why in the world did this film win over the Green Mile! While this movie is fair for the average movie fan, Big movie buffs like myself should not expect anything more than just a fair movie. For those of you who still want to see this movie, don't get your hopes up for this best picture winner. Instead, I recommend renting what should have been the true best picture nod: The Green Mile."
1,Another thing....,"If you were touched deeply (HA!) by the motif of ""beauty in the ordinary"", then go read Joyce's ""A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man"", which has in it a much deeper, genuine explanation of true beauty. This movie is hyperbole, a of easy answers that have a much greater assumed context than is developed in the film. By no means is it a masterpiece. The hype about it is just a flock of sheep proving that strength in numbers does, though it shouldn't, work.""And when at times the mob is swayed / to carry praise or blame too far / we may choose something like a star / to keep our minds on and be staid.""Joyce is luminous. Read it and discover REAL beauty."
1,"This ""Beauty"" is pretty ugly!","Usually I can find something of redeeming value in a movie, but honestly, I did not see it in this one. I feel as if the American public has been brainwashed into thinking that this movie deserved an Academy Award, but to me it was a dreary recital of the most selfish, self-centered, and downright dysfunctional people I have ever seen! To me, it did not seem artistic. It was just downright weird! I realize I am in the minority, but I really wish someone had told me how bad this movie was and I would not have wasted the time or money to rent and watch it."
2,It Could Have Been Great,"So now vulgarity gets the Oscar. Do I need my nose rubbed in vulgarity to make a point with me? No. I'm not that thick, and most other people aren't either. Yes, I can see the point Lester makes at the end, but sadly, too many people were offended by this movie to even GET the point. Do some people actually think Americans invented materialism, hypocrisy? Study history, and ancient history at that (I thought some of the examples to make these points were ludicrous). My opinion? The dumber the person, the greater they consider this movie. The more offended they are, the higher the intelligence."
1,Terribly boring,This movie is way to over rated and way to digusting:there's nothing enjoyable about an old man having sexual fantasies about his daughers best friend or about a gay neigbour abusing his son. This movie may have a good one had they altered the story line a bit and done some good directing and of course properly ended the movie. if your looking for drama filled with betrayal and evilness look no furhter to cruel intentions a movie that ended the right way.
1,This title does NOT come with the slipcover,"The movie itself is great; the blu-ray DISC itself is great too.The one star is for the misleading listing.Though the customer image shows a slipcover and blu-ray.com says so, Amazon.com told me that they simply don't have it and that photo is not accountable.I initially did not care about the cover too much but now think this causes such a false expectation and disappointment."
5,Either you get it or you don't,"If you look beyond the surface of this movie, its not trying to make a statement, its about life. I think the title may throw people off a bit. For those who didn't see it the first time give it another shot and try to think about what our main characters are realizing.Life is just life, you only really get one shot, don't waste it. Life is about living. Perhaps you can realize it without having to go through these situations yourself. This is why this movie is so great, IMHO.-g"
5,The Formula For A Good Movie,"All I have to say is that the preview for this movie did it no justice. American Beauty was incredible, but when I first saw the previews, it looked boring. This has occured in movies such as Meet Joe Black, The Devil's Advocate, The Matrix, and especially Fight Club. Movies like Battlefield Earth and Star Wars have been hyped up with their sci-fi previews, but only disappoint with bad plots. My Formula For A Good Movie is to make a bad preview, and you will get a good movie. When the audience is not expecting much and you surprise them, it will leave an impact. Anyway, American Beauty is great. It is such a tease to not release it until October!"
5,The Best Film I've Seen All Year!,"First I'd like to say that this movie is nothing like anything I've ever seen before. Maybe that is what sets it above all the rest. It could be the excellent acting, it could be the complex storyline, and it could be the wonderful direction. I can't decide. I will warn you that if you do not watch it with an open mind, you will hate it. It is basically about a family man who falls for one of his daughter's beautiful friends, which eventually leads to his mid-life crisis, and ultimately his death. I feel comfortable telling you he dies because in the first ten minutes of the film he tells you that he is going to (he is the narrator the entire time). Needless to say, this film deserved every Oscar nomination it received..."
1,whodunit? whocare?,"This movie is a who dun it where you have to guess who killed the dad. Now, i dint see American beauty because I dont like mystery. I like movies where people ACT! and not just who did the killing. My grandmother likes who dun its, though, so I know people out tehre like them, but I would rather wach a movie wioth James Dean or Marlyn Monroe. Also, even though I dint see it i know from previews for it that it was the dark haied girl who killed him, I think she's his daughter? See, I'm right and look at all the time and money i saved by not watching American Beauty!!!"
3,Married With Children,"He hates his job. He hates his life. He hasn't made love to his wife in years. His dysfunctional family are always arguing, and he lusts after beautiful young women he will never have. Meet America's newest hero...Stoner Al Bundy!"
1,Trash,"I really didn't think it could get any worse when the American public voted for Bill Clinton a second time, knowing what a lier he was. The fact that this movie is held up as some sort of statement of ""suburban America"" really shows how pathetic society really is. This is the worst movie I have seen in years. Go rent the South Park movie, it has more class."
2,Nothing is real & nothing to get hung about,An odd & terribly depressing movie whose only consolation is the unreality of the characters. The lovable drug dealer was a particularly unreal Hollywood creation. Do you have neighbors like this? Move.
2,When you can rent it... Rent something else,"I was not impressed with this movie, with all the awards it got I am starting to think drugs are in. You would have to be on something to enjoy this movie enough to give it such a high rating. But then again, to each their own.If you have ever seen a movie that got high reviews and walked away from it wondering how it got such high reviews. Well get ready for that feeling once again if you decide to watch this."
1,I am still nauseous!,"There are many things that bothered me about this movie. However, the biggest thing that bothered me in this movie was that characters that were supposed to be high school girls were involved in nudity in the movie."
1,Why did it win Best Picture of 1999?,"This review is for the DVD Region 1 disc of American Beauty (1999).I did not like this movie. Why did it win the Academy Award for Best Picture of 1999? The way they filmed the ending where you saw the reactions and where everyone was at, at the scene of the crime, was very well done.Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966) was better than this."
4,AMERICAN BEAUTY REVIEW,"American Beauty was a good movie, if you're thinking that it's supposed to be a sick movie. I mean, people say that it was terrible because everyone in the movie was messed up, but, the movie was supposed to be like that. I liked it except for the fact that a 40 year-old wanted a 16 year-old girl. That was a little awkward. So, was him masturbating in two scenes of the movie. All and all, the movie was good and I think it deserved Best Picture........kinda."
2,An unsurprising symptom of a culture.,"""American Beauty"" amounts to little more than a felicitous combination of skillfully contrived production values and purposefully directed acting put to the service of highly resonant metaphysical fraudulence -- which, of course, makes it eminently suitable for our time."
1,Horrible,"I agree; the movie was absolutely disgusting. It was revolting to see a middle-aged man go gaga for a highschool cheerleader. The way it was presented in the movie was disturbing. I just couldn't get over that part. It is inconceivable to think that people thought that part was funny and liked the movie, not to mention that it won awards. In the theatre, many women were expressing their distaste for the movie. Save your money."
2,"""A Misleading Story""","What ""American Beauty"" is supposed to be about involves a dysfunctional American suburban family who suffers uncommon everyday social problems. The idea of the dad being attracted to her daughter's friend is more frequent in real life than most people believe. But, I don't think it was done right when Kevin Spacey did drugs and other things to impress her. This didn't show any reaction from his daughter. This was a lot like a Jerry Springer episode.The entire main idea of this movie was very flawed because reaction to the situation was only seen through the eyes of Kevin Spacey: not of his wife or his daughter. It's like your looking for the hamburger buns and you're obviously in the dairy section. If you study this movie after you watch it a few times, you'll probably get the REAL idea of it."
4,Great Movie but,As Shannon posted up above be warned this movie will not work with all DVD players. I have a Mitsubishi DD-3000 player and have tried 3 copies of this movie and non of them will work. Of course it will work in my DVD player in my computer which doesn't have surround sound and a big viewing screen. I must say this movie is worth watching if you like a movie with a twist.
5,American Beauty,"If there were 10 stars to rate, this film would get all 10. A film that unabashedly breaks out of the traditional Hollywood mould, this masterpiece will leave you breathless, and will definitely make you think... Probably not for everyone (my mother hated it), but if you're not shocked by the typically shocking, you will love this film. This is one time I actually agreed with the Academy's choice for Best Film. Beautifully written, masterfully directed, with powerful performances by every cast member, this is a film that won't soon be forgotten."
3,Deeper than Most Could See,"This movie is secretly Zen and more profound than most critics ever noticed. If you can see beyond it's surface to the REAL story underneath, you will not only be thoroughly entertained, but perhaps even slightly changed."
4,Stays with you...,"Let's see, the cultural conservatives hate this movie because it leaves no possible dysfunctionality unturned. And hard-core artsy types don't care for it because it's not nearly audacious ENOUGH. But most viewers, I suspect, will find an intelligently paced, very well acted and beautifully shot film that they will not quickly forget. Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening got the Oscar nods, but the younger actors, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley and Mena Suvari were all spot on. And Chris Cooper and Peter Gallagher turned in remarkable performances as well. I won't say it's a perfect movie, but it is a film of genuine substance--the kind that lends itself to multiple interpretations and multiple viewings."
5,"Controversial, but amazing","The plot line was a little controversial, but the movie was so good; you forget that you thought it was controversial. I recommend it very much. It is a movie that we should never forget. Or I know I won't. You'll enjoy it."
3,"Nice film, but over-hyped.","This was an interesting, but not spectacular film from 1999. Watching it again recently, I noticed how dull it was to watch - particularly the long drawn out scenes with the neighbour's son and Spacey's daughter.Is American Beauty really as good as you may have heard? Unfortunately not. The hype that surrounded this film in 1999 made people go and see it. There was also considerable hype surrounding Anette Bening's performance. Let's just say her performance was okay, nothing spectacular.American Beauty is a good, but over-rated film."
3,An uncomfortable reflection,"Lots has been said about this movie that I won't rehash here. I'll just say that I thought it was an interesting fable of materialism run amuck, and the consequences of such lives.This movie has some dumb parts (the plastic bag) and can be a bit heavy-handed at times(How many saw the Marine's secret from a mile away?) but overall it was enjoyable.There's something dark lurking behind the McMansions and the SUVs and the overprogrammed families that comprise so much of our middle class in the US. This film comes close to articulating that darkness."
2,What does Sapphire mean?,"I have to say, American Beauty is one of my favourite movies, but this Blu-Ray feels very lackluster.Pros-Picture- quality is decentCons-Sound- horrible, I had to keep turning my t.v. volume up and down because some parts are inaudible, often times the volume would drop considerably mid-conversation. This didn't happen in the regular d.v.d., and it I've never had another blu-ray that I had this problem with either.Special features- next to non, I'm not exactly sure what makes this Sapphire Series but I'm not impressed.The movie gets 5 stars, the blu-ray gets 2."
4,great,this movie is about life and how real it is it makes you notice how life is so beautiful and you shouldn't miss out on anything the storyline on the movie couldn't be any better it hits topics where other movies don't open your eyes
2,This got best picture...?,"... and best director? Best original screenplay? Something tells me the votes were stolen at the same time as the Oscars.American Beauty is a long way from the worst movie of last year, but it's even further from the best.This satire purports to hold a candle up to the hidden underbelly of suburban America. It doesn't. While the story premise isn't bad, the characterization turns out to be almost uniformly one-dimensional (only Mena Suvari has any fun with her role). You pretty much know what to expect from each character within forty or fifty frames of meeting them. Where's the beef?American Beauty is beautifully filmed, but anyone who thinks this work reveals anything whatsoever about America probably believes everyone in France wears a beret and eats frogs......"
2,A Dissenting Opinion,"This smug satire makes its tired little points against all the obvious targets - middle class hypocrites, homophobes, and uptight squares of all ages. Filmed in a slow, narcoticized rhythm that gives it the appearance of being deep and artistic, it predictably won a slew of Academy Awards. But there's more wit, insight, and true satire in any 10 minutes of ""The Simpsons.""p.s. One major scene involving weightlifting and a bong has to be the single stupidest plot twist in movie history."
1,Hollywood Hideous,"Once again, a film depicts the boredom and shallowness of suburban America. But this one had overly stereotypical characters and little originality.One of the worst examples of this was the white middle class houswife/real estate agent trying unsuccessfully sell a house. She over acted the part of the phony, foolish salesperson who did not connect with the customers. To maximize her white suburban foolishness, her skeptical customers included an Hispanic couple, a black couple, and what appears to be lesbian couple.The scene of her with the difficult lesbian couple was stolen right from Fast Times at Ridgemont High, when Judge Reinhold's character was waiting on two difficult gay customers in the fish joint, while wearing that ridiculous pirate uniform.The difference is, Ridgemont was funny. American beauty was stupid. I guess the Academy in Hollywood liked the message. They sure are easy to fool."
1,Don't buy if you live in the US,"We had no idea that this DVD would not play on our DVD player and that there are Regions for DVDs. Tried using codes to get our DVD player tricked into playing the disk, but after an hour of trying to figure out how to do this, we gave up! Got the DVD disk cheap so not worth returning. Only buy Region 1 disks if you live in the US. Lesson learned for us! The movie is very good however!"
1,The Point?,"I watch a movie for a number of reasons:1. To be entertained2. To grow emotionally and/or intellectually3. To be challenged emotionally and/or intellectuallyThis movie does none of the above.Why do I dislike this move?1. I cannot identify with any of the characters, since they are all blatantly incompetent.2. The depiction of innocence in the movie is not believeable.3. The premise of the movie is not fully believable, due to the previous reasons.4. The premise is also entirely outdated. The realization that middle class people can get caught up in seeking social status and their problems has already been played out way too many times.It was a waste of money at the movie theater, and it's a waste of money on a vhs tape or dvd."
5,paralizing,"The best movie. Ever.See it for the brilliant acting. See it for the amazing directing. See it for the tantalizing score. See it for Wes Bently's eyes, if nothing else.Its fightening, hysterical, and I couldn't move for ten minutes after I saw it. Literally. I started crying from the Plastic Bag scene, and didn't stop after that.If I could give it more than five stars, i'd give it infinate stars.witty, touching, searing... especially for those people who have seen that look in our father's eyes, that look that Ricky Fitts gets just before he leaves home...truly brilliant."
2,Letdown,"With a good cast and director, I had my hopes a little too high before watching. American Beauty could have been amazing. The lighting and angles really bug me, and for a script with very little encrypted or interesting dialogue, the visuals are important to get right. I think it was worth the $7.50 spent to see it once, just because of the conversations about it afterward. Some love it, some hate it. In my opinion, when describing this movie, using the word ""eh"" is inevitable.Message received but not well delivered, if that makes sense at all.Rent this movie before buying it."
5,PHENOMENAL!!!!!!!!!,THIS MOVIE ROCKED! I LOVED IT! IT WAS GREAT! I ENJOYED IT ALL! I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT A FIRST-TIMER DIRECTED IT! WOW WOW WOW WOW! COULD THERE BE A GREATER DRAMA THAN THIS?! IT WAS A SUPERB FILM WITH FANTASTIC THEMATIC ELEMENTS THAT MADE IT STAND OUT ABOVE THE REST OF THE NOMINEES AT THE OSCARS!! I FOUND IT TO BE VERY POWERFUL AND IT MADE ME TEAR-UP A LITTLE AT THE END!! WHAT CAN YOU SAY ABOUT ANNETTE BENING? SHE WAS GREAT AND I FELT FOR HER AS HER HUSBAND WAS FANTACISING ABOUT AN 18 YEAR OLD GIRL! AND KEVIN SPACEY! HE WAS AS GOOD AS ANYONE COULD BE! HE DESERVED TO WIN THE OSCAR! AND SO DID ANNETTE! I LOVED THIS FILM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,"Not about Truth, Justice, and the American Way","I have seen plays on the West End in London that are much like American Beauty. They are technically well done, well lit, dry, and as comfortable as a moral sewer.I didn't like any of the characters in the film. It was not America, it was the New Yorker, intellectuals feasting upon suburban America with MALICE.I didn't find the film funny or moving. It was ugly. It is the most violent film in years. And without a heart, you have just another aborted fetus.If you smell what I am cooking?"
2,GARBAGE,My original review must be erased because it was overly pious and advocated outright rejection of the perverted hoodlums of Hollywood. I have little love for most of the noxious pukes in the entertainment industry -- and I consider this film to be a bunch of pretentious crapola -- but freedom means that people can watch this sewage if they so choose. The fact that such a film can be haled by so many is further demonstration that the herd mentality has almost completely taken us over.
4,"Great movie, poor bluray transfer","The movie is excellent, but the video quality is not up to blu-ray standards. The special features are also minimal and not worth extra money."
5,Excellent movie,I really enjoyed this movie. Lots of great acting and an interesting plot. The DVD is excellent with a great commentary track with the directory Sam Mendes. He really explains his craft and this was espacially interesting as this was his directorial debut.
1,Vile - made me sick to my stomach,"Best Picture of the year was The Sixth Sense. This movie is garbage. The less intelligent a person is, the more they will like this movie. The more intelligent a person is, the more they will be offended by this movie."
3,Pretty Good but Doesn't Top The Sixth Sense,"""American Beauty"" offered a lot to us but I think ""The Sixth Sense"" was better because it had better acting and it was more suspenseful......""American Beauty"" was good, but in my opinion it didn't ""shine"" like some movies do"
