2,"Strong at first, now breaking","I like the size, color, and external shoe pockets. At first, I loved this wardrobe. Now after about a month of use, the bar is bending and the plastic pieces are breaking under the weight of clothes. I will have to replace this soon and will not buy this product again. The similar closet I used this one to replace lasted for more than two years and was still standing strong when I got rid of it except the exterior was torn."
2,Partial Satisfaction Clothing Wardrobe,"The free-standing clothing bags I received did not come with full complete installation instructions. Once both units were together and the clothing placed inside, one unit's zipper sticks, the pole which holds the clothing was partially bent and now the unit leans as if it will fall. I put on light-weight items inside and still it leans. The second unit with the heaviest items is fine, zipper works and it is nice.What can I do about to get the faulty unit replaced? I paid in advance expecting the merchandise to be top-notch.Help."
1,Bad product,"Its shoulders were made by plastic, and the shoulders were bent and false. It didn't hold heavy clothes. It is wrong product."
3,Not for everyday use,"My mom had gotten me this about a year ago because I don't have a closet in my room. It's just ok if you ask me. It's not really for everyday use but it works. When I was trying to put it together the canvas ripped at the top along the zipper but it still zips. I've but everything from jeans, shirts, shoes, and linins in this and it never bent to one side and the bar never bent. The only thing, I wished it unzipped along the bottom."
2,Review,"I've only had this for about a month, and already it is leaning forward and to one side.I got a cheaper one at Big Lots! That is months older, and doesn't do that at all.I love the color, and it would probably be perfect for just a summer wardrobe."
4,Good review of Carson's Bio,"Since Johnny Carson was the guy and place to be late night tv, it provides yet another look at J. Carson and his life."
4,Excellent,"Excellent coverage of a little covered topic. Very good military and political analysis, particularly on the strategic level. Illustrates the sheer chaos that was the Russian Civil War, with its many factions, twists, and turns. To the best I could tell also relatively fair to all of the participants, the author's conclusions made sense and matched my own understanding and background.Potential readers should note, however, that it is clearly written for someone who wants to understand why Bolsheviks won and how they did it, and not a simple human interest story. For someone simply wanting an interesting read it would be dry. If you need to know about the Russian Civil War, however, this is your book."
2,Don't waste your time - TRASH,Very disappointed. This CD is trash. I was expecting great music and what i received was a list of songs that all sound EXACTLY the same.
2,Very Basic,"This title should be named Basic Soccer Skills, even though it does not cover even the most basic skills, its more like an introduction to basic skills!"
1,The Mystery of the Disappearing Ink,Larding the Lean Earth: Soil and Society in Nineteenth-Century AmericaMy husband purchased the 2003 paperback edition of this book for a class. The content of the book is fine. The problem is that every odd numbered page from 145 to the last page grows increasingly blurred until finally becoming illegible. I have never owned a book suffering from such poor quality printing and intend to ask the publisher for another copy. Hill & Wang should be ashamed.
1,false advertising,"my gripe with this book is, in part, the title: This Just In -- WHAT I COULDN'T TELL YOU ON TV... Note: there is nothing newsworthy in this book - nothing new, no secrets, not one thing that has not been told on tv a hundred times. granted, it is a well-written autobiography and anyone interested in the intricate doings of CBS news may enjoy it. but, for the average reader, way too much detail about CBS news and the personalities involved.i think the average reader will pick up this book hoping to obtain insight on world events from a respected journalist. instead one gets the story of mr. schieffer's life - a quick read (many pages can be skipped) but not much meat on the bone.perhaps i just missed the point. after all many of the country's most respected journalists endorsed the book (buddies?)...Even Dan Jenkins: ""Made me smile more than a platter of Tex-Mex enchiladas""..... PLEEEEASE....."
1,Book not in good condition,"I got the book to have it signed by its author Bob Schieffer. Unfortunately, the book was not in a good condition at all. Half of the front page was ripped off and there was a ""low prize"" button on the cover that I could not get off."
5,One of the top books I have read,"This is one of the top books I have read. This book is much better than other books of a similar subject such as Lesley Stahl's ""Reporting Live"", George Stephanopoulos's ""All TooHuman"", and Pat Schroeder's ""24 Years of House Work"".While it is only a small part of the book, it gives the reader a much better insight on the workings of Washington.The stories are interesting and you can not help but be drawn in to his life as a reporter.Just like his reporting, he has done his research very well.It is a must read if you are interested in Washington or past major events."
5,Talking head writes,And he writes very well. This isn't a quick read. The stories are too good and worthy of contemplation (e.g. his early observations in Viet Nam) to zoom through. It is a shamethat the current crop of news readers aren't up to his level.
1,This Just In- But That Doesn't Mean You Should Read It,"The CBS icon and Face the Nation host reveals little that his viewers don't already know as he tries to cash in before he's shown the door at the Tiffany network. This book does reinforce his unwritten role as weekly spinmeister for the Democratic National Committee with its anecdotes of minor peccadilloes and behind-the-scene struggles of reporting. Don't look for huge revelations or belly laughs, just more homespun homilies delivered without the audible pontificating inflections."
5,Stuck in Kansas,"Bob Schieffer's book is terrific. Schieffer makes anyone who is interested in journalism or who works in the field, feel good about their quirky desires to get the big story. In an unassuming way, he weaves the reader through his personal struggles, and accomplishments, modestly pointing out every time luck happened to come his way. His insights into war and politics seem especially relevant in this day and age. I'm 29 and love this book. My father is 60 and loves it. I would recommend it to anyone."
5,"lovely lotion, very mild scent","I am very impressed by this lotion, and have ordered 2 more bottles as gifts. It works great on my dry skin, without being too oily or sticky; it absorbs quickly and easily. The scent is a little more ""woody"" than standard patchouli, but I count that as a plus! The scent is subtle, perfect for people who are sensitive to ""too much perfume"", but, when other people notice it, they always comment how pleasant the scent is."
1,product to strong,not very pleased with the scent- little bit to strong. I prefer just a hit of patchouli - was a bit overpowering.
3,patcholi,"i think it is ok, but i have found that this scent did not stay with me very long. i would like something that the scent of patcholi stayed with me longer."
3,No patchouli smell,I was very disappointed in the smell. It does not smell like patchouli at all. The lotion is OK but no patchouli smell(which why the main reason I wanted it).
3,Arnold Halloween Mask,"This mask was not as easily identifiable as we thought, but it was good quality. It is a bit stuffy though (as all masks tend to be) because it covers the whole head. Did its job and shipped quickly."
3,"A great source on color space, but that's about it","Billup's book is creative, fun read. But looking back on it, it's not one of those essential film books. The book's greatest strength is explaining color space and color depth, which are Billup's profession as he works on the technical side of HD production. He explores these rather dry issues in a fun and witty way. And he also explores working in Hollywood in a new, positive way. But beyond that, the book gives a very, very, very broad look at every other field of digital moviemaking, making it seem in the end too darn general to be effective. A better book for breaking into digitial filmmaking: $30 Film School by Michael Dean. It does a much better job of covering all the bases and is just as fun."
4,"Engaging and Real, If Quite Opinionated","Billups really loves the technical side of video, and his book is a great way to learn about colorspace and various image formats. It is presented in a conversational, personal style that I found quite engaging.The book emphasizes technical and economic planning, NOT how to relate ideas or write a script. Not a problem, but the title may be misleading.Billups gets hung up on what he considers to be amateur: MiniDV's 4:1:1 colorspace, ""fake 16:9"", ""electronic focus rings"", etc. A look at Billups' website conveys this same preoccupation with colorspace and camera functionality. Points to consider, yes, but too closely associated with our projects' success.With the advent of cheap 24p HDV (HVR-V1U), DVCPRO-HD (HVX200) or XDCAM (PWM-EX1), I must disagree with Billups that no camera above MiniDV is worth buying.If you are looking for an engaging way to sort out technical information, this book comes recommended."
3,Not as accurate or complete as it could have been.,"Sorry to say, this dictionary of the avant-garde has it's gaps, misinterpretations, and inaccuracies. It is quite valuable for the most part, but the aforementioned problems should be addressed before the next edition hits the racks. There is scant mention of free improvisation, Derek Bailey (and his many contemporaries), Paul Klee, Al Hansen (and many other valuable Fluxus artists indivudually) and much else, but there are referances to one-off a-g practitioners (such as that Republican apologist P.J. O'Rourke) and others. Weird...maybe RK was trying to use his dictionary to stir up debate, but that's not what dictionaries are fundamentally for, I think."
5,Cookbook,This cookbook I purchased at Amazon is exactly what I wanted and ordered. Thanks for this quick and easy way to shop from home.
5,absolutely incredible,"this album is brilliant. lazycain is without a doubt, one of the best indie-rock-punk bands of all time. unfortunately, as all great bands do, they broke up. this album has some great musicianship and heavy rocking out, and great lyrical value as well. they have some of the most insane hooks you will ever hear. they know so much about music, and are able to fit it all into one small album. buy this NOW. see also jimmy eat world and submerge."
2,A letdown,My 21 month old son loves Disney Sing Along Videos. We must have at least 10 of them in our DVD collection. This one is one of his least favorites. It's all live action and a doesn't keep his attention well.
5,Kid's LOVE!!!! this video,"My daughter had this video on VHS when she was little and would watch it over and over. I then passed it on to my brother and it went through his 5 kids (they all loved it too). As I am a Grandma now, I had to have this video for my girls so I even called my Sister In Law in hopes that we could remember the name. Needless to say we found it on Amazon (now in DVD) and I had to have it. The girls love it and even my daughter(she's graduating from high school this year) sat down to watch it with them and boy did it bring back memories. Just to clarify, my grandkids belong to my much older son. Well now you know my story, I hope it tells you how much I think of this video. It's fun, engaging for the kids, and very appropriate for any age."
4,Dalmatians sing into Your heart,"As an owner of a dalmatian it was lovely to see this film and the action of the dogs. A dalmatian loves to work and be a participant of your family's activities, which this film promotes in a lovely way."
1,Absolutely Horrible (and annoying),"We were excited to introduce Sing Along's to our toddler and checked this one out from the library to see if he was ready. Thank goodness we didn't buy it! Unlike the older Sing Along discs that I remember from my youth, this is not a compilation of scenes and songs from classic Disney movies, but wretchedly thrown together camp songs and original travesties. The ""nanny"" looks terrible in dalmatian-print everything to the point of scary, and the songs are so annoying that we found ourselves fast-forwarding half-way through songs because we couldn't stand it anymore. Undoubtedly small children will have fun singing the Hokey Pokey, etc., but such material is plentifully available on cheap cds and television without paying Disney prices."
1,Disappointed,"Don't buy this CD! It is impossible to listen to, as the volumn varies from inaudible to very loud. I tried it first on the computer, then on two different players, so it's the recording editing that's the problem. It may be fine in a concert hall butnot in a home or car. I am very disappointed as I heard some of the music on GotRadio.com and wanted to hear more. A waste ofmy money. Don't Waste Yours."
4,Good,"Great art and the same great story, my only complaints are that it is to short and the ending comes to abruptly and feels rushed."
2,Probably should start from the 1st book,"might be unfair for me to review this with out having read the others in tye seris buuuut at least I can give you the prespective of a first time reader. nice drawings and an okay story but I wish I would not have bought it, took it to the second hand shop after only reading it once.I did read it all the way through and it had some confusing moments, also linked with other gothic culture stories so a couple of ah ha moments."
4,Freedom from overeating,I read this book about 1 year ago and was very much impressed with the idea of gluttony and sin. This has been the biggest thing that has helped me to get on the road to normality again.I lost 110 lbs - about 25 years ago through Overeaters Anony.but did not keep it off. I am currently in a group now where the focus is on the Bibical approach and we will be using some of the material from her book in our class. Focusing on the obedience to God is the right way to go. This book has a lot going for it....Barbara
5,amazing!,"A one day read that can free you from your gluttony or other addictions, IF you stop trying to do it yourself, and let God help you. Amazing insight and a straightforward method. I have bought several to give to friends."
2,"The spiritual advice is great, but . . .","please be aware that you will be advised to skip lunch or dinner on a daily basis. This is just not healthy for so many people and it can permanently lower you metabolism. I believe that Diane Hampton's heart is in the right place, but I also believe God will be there to help you lose weight even if you follow the (much healthier) 6 mini meals a day plan or 3 small meals with two good snacks. In short, the spiritual advise is good, the eating plan isn't. I purchased this book because of all the good reviews, none of which mentioned the plan of only two meals daily."
1,Update,"I just wanted to give an update on my progress. I cannot, with good conscience, support Diane's program any longer. I am currently weight training, doing cardio, and eating healthy. Eating healthy is not eating whatever you want. In 12 weeks, I brought my risk factor for heart disease down from 5.9:1 (which is horrible) to around 3 (which is nonexistent risk). I did it with exercise and eating right. I also lost two sizes with just a 12 pound scale loss because I was gaining muscle, too. To be healthy, you have to work at it! Sure, you can lose weight eating whatever you want if you eat less - at least up to a point. But who wants to be a skinny fat woman or a skinny fat man? Wouldn't you rather be healthy and have a fabulous physique? Try Body for Life by Bill Phillips. Also check out the www.bodybuilding.com website for inspiration, education, and good products."
5,A guide to the Canonical Traveler,"This book encapsulates some of the best writing available in the Holmes Canon - it ranges from gems like the Speckled Band to the only one where Holmes (almost) lost his heart to a woman - Irene Adler and her Scandal in Bohemia. Holmes has an ageless charm. He is the most portrayed fictional character on film, it is well worth one's while to peruse the Sherlockian Canon, and this book is a great beginning point"
4,Hear my words with faith and passion.,"To some people, Lyle Lovett is that guy with the funny hair who used to be married to Julia Roberts. But his fans know that he's a hell of a talented singer/songwriter. This was his second album. There were four singles released from the album. ""Give Back My Heart"" reached #13 on the Country chart, ""She's No Lady"" reached #17, ""I Loved You Yesterday"" reached #24 and ""If I Had a Boat"" reached #66. Lovett wrote all the songs on the album. Many of the songs are quite witty. Lovett is classified as a country artist, but several of the songs here have a jazzy feel to them. Good album."
5,Blue-eyed soul under a ten gallon hat,"A solidly brillant album from first to last, this effort is Lovett's best. His lyric delivers sardonic wit and poetic brevity with soulful force. The musicianship is stellar with the combination of horns, piano and guitar laying a smooth rythym and blues groove with an occassional twang that gives him his undeserved ""country"" classification. For the best of the best, take a deep breath and savor the vocal delivery and excellent solos of ""She's No Lady"". Or the powerful, restrained intensity and wit of ""M-O-N-E-Y"". An undeniably great album."
5,Great Ride--Lyle Lovett's Pontiac,"Classic Lovett. Creative, pensive, entertaining...Favoites on this CD include Don't Touch My Hat, Long Tall Texan (with Randy Newman), and That's Right, You're Not from Texas."
3,I'm not sure I'm gonna stick around,"Ok, I'm a new fan of Lyle Lovett's. And I dont know how long thats gonna last. The first song i ever heard by him was a Gospel tune he did called ""pass me not"". I thought his singing in the song was flawless and beautiful. I went out and bought ponitac, on the basis of critics saying it was his Best album. I just finished listening to it all the way through. And Maybe it will grow on me, but right now, im a little disappointed. I mean how do you write a song about a World War 2 vet and then follow it with ""Shes Hot to Go"". That felt weird to me after listening to it. I did like a few songs, although not that much. Simple Song was ok, so were a few others. ""If I had a Boat"" didn't do it for me at all, not like i was told it would. My firs impression of this album: Its like a bad mix tape with a couple dark songs, with little emotion, and a couple run-off-the-mill lighthearted ones."
3,Pontiac,"It's okay. Not my favorite. I've heard better Lyly Lovett. Maybe a true blue Lovett fan might ""love it"". Just not me."
4,"Not my favorite Lyle album, but worth having.","If you like Lyle Lovett for the same reasons I do this won't be your favorite of his albums. Although the CD sounds crisp and contains some of the witty, intelligent and uplifting songs I have grown to love from Lyle Lovett. There are a few songs that fall well outside of that category -- ""Pontiac"" and ""Simple Song"" are two of them. Although they are well written, their introspective and somber tone are a far cry from what I consider Lyle Lovett music to be. What I'm saying is, if I want to listen to quality introspective, somber music, I'll listen to Sara's Mirrorball. My affinity for Lyle's music, as unfortunate as it may sound, has no room for this type of music from him -- its just not Lyle Lovett."
5,smells great,"easy to apply! Smells great! definitely recommended for those who want to smell and feel great all day long! Feels great, too"
3,Official Guide,"This book is good if you want an overview of what SAP CRM has to offer. However, if you are looking for technical information, I wouldn't purchase this book."
2,Good overview,"If you are looking for an overview into CRM in general, this is a good book. If you want to learn anything in depth about SAP CRM this will not help you. There is nothing specific here about SAP CRM, no how to's, transactions, not even a detail explanation or example of a BDoc."
1,My SAP CRM,"This book is like a newspaper article; no technical or functional information.It just gives an overview and for those looking for technical / functional knowledge, this is not reccomnded."
5,=),"this is a good product, it came in on time and... its queen!! hehe its really cool. great product =)"
5,The art of Art,"Garfunkel proves his diverse artistic abilities in this wonderful collection of prose poems. Each poem has a small reference at the bottom of the page as to where Art was when he wrote it. A short collection but worth every penny. Paul Simon wrote some beautiful tunes with Art, and Art did Simon's lyrics justice with his heavenly voice. But this book shows that the literary abilities were not strictly confined to Simon. Highly worth owning."
3,"wobbly batteries, good light","I use this on a construction site, inside poorly lit rooms. Works good enough for my use. One issue the batteries had too much room to move and the light would flicker as it lost or gained power on their movement. Wasn't a real big deal, but I put in my rechargeables and they seem to be doing alright - no flickering. I might go for a different brand next time."
1,Sizing is way off,I was so looking forward to this bra because of my latex allergies. I ordered the same size as my other bras and the hook wouldn't meet for me to even determine if the cup size was correct. So disappointed.
1,Sizing way off,"I ordered this bra in the same size as all of my other bras. In fact, I ordered another bra from a different company, in this same size, on the same day as I ordered this bra. The cup size is way off. It it very much smaller as compared to all my other bras. After one washing, it is no longer possible for me to wear it. A big dissappointment and waste of money."
1,Not for me.,"I have skin disorder that makes my skin super sensitive. I thought, lets give this a try, all cotton will be good. Bad thought. There is nothing soft about it. I can't wear it because it irritates my skin. If you are buying this becuase you have easily irritated skin. do not bother....."
4,Cliff in the 80's,"This 16 track collection was released as part of Cliff's 40th Anniversary and covers the Eighties with the hit singles Wired For Sound, Please Don't Fall In Love, Two Hearts and The Only Way Out it includes 2 tracks taken from the Dressed For The Occasion and the rest of the songs are tracks from various albums and b-sides including the rare song Reunion Of The Heart"
4,Beware of sound quality,"I agree with the other reviewer that this is very good playing.But the piano is set somewhat back, and the sound quality is far from ideal. A pity; a bit unusual for the usually excellent Nimbus."
3,Great Coffeetable Book,"I thought this would be a good reference to pick movies that I wanted to see. However, there are several movies included that I would never recommend. Therefore, this book will become a conversational piece rather than a book of reference."
3,More like a used book than new,"Cover edges were banged up and worn. The book was 60 percent off, but had gone through a lot before I received it."
4,Great guide for any type of film watcher!,"1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die might have a title that turns people away. It kind of sounds ridiculous, doesn't it? Yet, within we find films spanning across all of cinema history. This isn't some simple pop culture list which compiles popular Hollywood fare designed to rake in profit for the film companies. This is very much a serious list compiled by a professional cinephile. It is perhaps most useful in selecting the cream of the crop when it comes to films before 1970 (I imagine this will appeal to the younger film buffs considering this book).This edition has been updated to include films from the first decade of the twenty first century (although many deserving independent and foreign films from this time are absent which is most likely due to needing to keep the list at 1001). Overall, it's a great start for any prospective film buff and a nice way to discover somethings that older film buffs may have missed."
4,Good,"I love the product itself, but the condition it was in didn't seem very ""new"" to me. There was a rip in the page, and the cover was a little scuffed up. The book itself was great, and I would reccomend buying it. It's very interesting to read"
3,Delightful,"There are movies here you'd rather not to see, ever. And others you want to see at least 1001 times before you die, but they aren't included in this list. There's even the be-careful fact about the spoilers. However, I'm must say this fresh edition looks beautiful with Black Swan and the hardcover. The movie comments by Steve Jay Schneider are accurately pointed and his pertinent discussions open interesting parentheses soon-to-be explored by the viewer."
1,Don't buy this book,"The issue with this book isn't that there are factual errors or that its list of movies isn't what you would pick. The big problem with this book is that the writers frequently spoil the movie for the reader. The most blatant example I've found is the review of ""Don't Look Now"", where the third paragraph recounts what is probably the entire last five minutes of the film. The writer then has the audacity to add, ""It is no exaggeration to say that few scenes in the history of cinema have proven as effective at sending chills up the spines of viewers as this one."" Also, I recently watched ""Oldboy"" and followed it up by reading the review in this book. The second sentence of the first paragraph, if fresh in a person's mind, would definitely have given away an important plot development. I'm glad I didn't read it before watching the movie.Please, do yourself a favor and don't buy this book. Or if you feel you still want to, watch the movie before reading the review."
3,"Fun to browse through, but not the quintessential book","The errors and oddities of inclusions and exclusions make this book a near miss for me. There are others as good, IMHO."
3,"Good, but can be better","It's a good book, but I think that author could choose newest movies. There is a lot of 10, 20, 30's movies and few from the recent decades."
1,less then a star,"1001 movies 5th edition....hmmm....having spend the money on that paper brick i wonder what i can do with it...?prop up my sofa maybe...? out of those 1001 mentioned flicks,only about a hundred are actually worth watching...and those have most likely been already watched by the average movie fan.other movies, just to mention a 110 million dollar spinner The music comedy 'blues brothers', not even given 1 line...tsk'ghost' or 'convoy'....'silent running'....'the big lebowski'...???dont wanna write a book about the other 1001 movies you should see,...the ones that made some money or had some meaning....my advice ask friends and family whats good and you'd be better advised plus you would save a few bucks you could use to see some 'great ones'.... ciao"
3,Problem with book quality.,"The book was new, but the top corners of some pages in the center of the book were torn or eaten by bugs; wasn't worth trying to return it."
3,"Fun and interesting book, but some surprising omissions.","I received this book as a Christmas gift and have enjoyed skimming through it. Several movies of which I was previously unaware I would now like to see. However, I was very surprised at some of the films not included. For example, there isn't a single Harold Lloyd film, and one of John Huston's, Bogart's, and E. G. Robinson's best films, ""Key Largo,"" is omitted, yet ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" and ""Total Recall"" are on the list???"
2,Where the hell is 'The Shop around the Corner'?,"1. It doesn't include 'The Shop around the corner', whereas 'Apocalypto' and 'Borat' is included. How is that REMOTELY possible? I mean, it's not even 100(even if the movie doesn't make THAT cut, it's a sacrilege), it's 1001 !2. It's WAY TOO bottom heavy. Movies before 1968 doesn't even make half of the total pages. Unfamiliarity is no excuse, since we can watch pretty much any classics thanks to the DVDs."
4,Great! but...,As a movie lover this seemed to be a perfect gift for me...until I learned there was a new edition coming in the fall.Apart from that I was absolutely pleased with this book and I'm looking forward to watching the movies listed in the book that I haven't seen.If you don't mind having this edition (that only lists movies till 2004) then I wouldn't hesitate on buying it.
4,"Good product, minor issues","I've used this toner cartridge for a few months now, printing about 500 pages, and the print quality is just as good as the original toner cartridge from Samsung. I took a star off because the new cartridge does squeak quite a bit when printing."
4,"Works great, Fast delivery",The cartrige worked great and it arrived far faster than I had expected. I am very satisfied.
5,Very fast,"I haven't used this yet---but the company was very fast. I ordered it right before my other one ran out so I was ready. However, the other people who bought said they work fine, so I'm not worried."
2,Vertical Stripes,"I have recently purchased this toner and have found that if I print over 2 pages, all subsequent pages have vertical stripes on the right and it becomes more pronounced the more pages I print.The toner works and if your using this for scrap notes for only your perusal, it doesn't matter. but printing resumes is definitely something you can't use this toner for."
3,Laser Replacement Cartridge,This product cost about 1/3 the price of the prior cartridge. In my opinion the ink darkness and quality are not as good as the original product but it serves my purpose because I just use it around the house.
2,Review of Compatible Toner,"I had bought this toner prior and felt it was a good value. It was significantly less expensive than the Samsung official toner. The toner results in very light print quality. I manually have to set the print quality to ""Dark"" and even then it is very light in quality. I think I will stick to the official toner from now on even though this is less expensive. I did shake the toner on multiple occasions to make sure the content is well distributed without any positive effect. Not a good product in my opinion."
1,Not worth it,"I bought this ink with the hopes of saving some money. I put the cartridge in my printer and it won't even go through the warm up cycle. This toner is not worth the hit or miss chance you make buying it. I threw caution to the wind when I ordered this product with the number of 1 star review, boy, was I wrong to do so. Save your money and buy the true Samsung cartridge for the printer it may be double the price but it will work every time."
1,Blew up after some usage,Everything was great at first. Quick delivery but eventually the cartridge just blew up inside my printer. There was toner everywhere. I would not recommend this toner cartridge.
1,You should probably look elsewhere,"I bought two of these toner cartridges and while they both work, both of them leave black streaks down the pages. If you care about how your print-outs look, you should probably look elsewhere."
4,Product okay for the price,Product came very quickly (big plus)! Does not produce as clean a print as the one from Samsung but for the price it works very well.
1,DOA,"Everything goes into the printer fine, but when I try and print. I get an error message and the red light stays on. Never did print a single line, lots of toner in bag when I opened the box. Also like another reviewer stated there was a picture about removing tape from the green drum, it didn't have the tape. I replaced it with used Samsung cartridge and that printed fine although it is almost out of toner. So it isn't the printer. Its the toner. Going to try and get a refund. Btw I have the ml 2010 and, I noticed some differences between the Samsung model and this one."
1,Cartidge Jammed causing printer gear issue,This cartridge printed fine until today when it froze up and ground the nylon gear in the printer.Before you buy this read the reviews - this does not seem to be an isolated incident.I'll never by from these people again.
4,Good quality at a bargain price,"While I have not had the cartridge long enough to judge its life span, it definitely prints better and crisper than the previous ""bargain"" cartridge I bought from another outfit. No complaints!"
4,It's ok for the price,"The toner is OK, it works very well with high quality paper, but in regular paper, its not even and a little light. It's a good deal for the price, if you don't need high quality results."
1,Bad quality drum,It is defective and since I installed new drum every page get blank horizontal line on right side of paper.
2,I Got What I Paid For,I ordered these compatible toner cartridges because they were far less cost than OEM. The first one is light along one edge sometimes. The other one jams the paper and will not work at all. I am going to pursue this with the vendor if I can figure out how to do it.
4,Good remanufactured cartridge; inexpensive.,"This is as good as any remanufactured cartridge, and it is inexpensive. I don't think there is anything else you need to know."
5,"Good item, great price :)",The cost savings alone made this VERY worthwhile. We have bought these refills twice now without any problems! WAY cheaper than a new one and works perfectly!
2,Disappointed,"This toner appeared to be a good deal because of the low price. However, I have never had a cartridge run out of toner so fast. The indicator on my computer still said I had more than half left when it stopped printing. Even after shaking the cartridge it refused to print more than a few pages. Perhaps my cartridge was defective but if this is indicative of all the products, it is hardly a good deal. I guess you only get what you pay for!Dave"
4,Working Good,We have had the toner for a few weeks now. Seems really good. It is a much better price that the manufactures brand and seems just as good.
1,... you get what you pay for...,"Purchased this toner in an attempt to save some money vs. the OEM product. Printer wouldn't even recognize the toner cartridge. After paying $6.50 for shipping originally, must now pay out of pocket to return their useless / DEFECTIVE product."
2,Chinese Made Junk Replacement Toner,"You take a huge risk when you insert this into your printer. I want to make it clear that this is NOT a Samsung product. I bought it without looking too closely at the detail -- the seller should make it more clear that this ""compatible"" word means NOT ORIGINAL. In fact, those words should be used, as when you put this junky Chinese stuff into your printer, it makes a horrible clunk -- there is powder spewing out of it into my machine, and a stripe shows up on every page. You know how most toner cartridges have an element that slides across the wire, cleaning it? This one doesn't have that. It is pure garbage."
1,Not worth the savings...,"I bought this cartridge twice and both times it was a disappointment. The operation and printing was fine, however, it simply did not last as long as the original Samsung toner. The number of pages obtained was much, much less then 3000. May be more close to 1200. I would much rather pay more and get a decent toner."
2,Samsung COMPATIBLE ink cartridge,"This ink cartridge was much cheaper than the Samsung name brand. However, when printing, adjustments need to be made to darken the print job, which can become cumbersome when needing to print several jobs. Otherwise, no problem."
2,Spotty printing,"It's always a crap shoot when buying the generic toners. The one I got was not the worst, but it's far from good. The printer has reported that toner is low from the moment I installed this unit. But the worst is that there are blank spots in the printing. They are not large (only a couple of millimeters), but when you are printing pages of text it means that you are going to miss a letter here and there on the page, which is really frustrating. Next time I'll spend the extra $20 and buy the manufacturer's brand.In summary, if you can live with little blank spots on your printouts, then this is an economical choice. If not, go with the name brand."
5,Printer Toner,"Just installed the new aftermarket toner and after turning the printer off and back on, everything seems to be working normally. Printer seems to be printing normally and there are no issues with the cartridge thus far."
5,"Normal toner, good price","Prints well. Haven't had any problems with streaks like other have mentioned. Much better price than the carts I ordered from toner companies before, which were even lower than the manufacturer's toner. I can't imagine toner being any cheaper than this. My page count: only time will tell; so far so good."
1,Does not work with ML-2510 Series,"I bought this toner based on the description that it is compatible with Samsung ML-2510. which I have - plus the price is cheap. It fit in the cartridge holder of the printer and looks exactly like the original toner cartridge the printer came with. After installing and trying several times to make it work, it just wouldn't print or do anything. I tried the old cartridge back again and the old one works just fine except the print came out light. If this product really does work with ML-2510, maybe I just got a defective product."
4,very good,This is a very good quality for the price. Saved a lot compare to buying at local store. thanks .
2,"Ordered two, returned one",Ordered two of these for my cheap Samsung printer. First cartridge printed almost 3/4 solid black pages- the wiper in the cartridge was obviously not working or installed incorrectly during remanufacturing. Opened second box and it worked like a charm. Thankfully Amazon's refund policy will take care of the defective one but I would have been screwed if I only purchased one or if I opened the other one first and 6 months down the road the second one was defective and was out of the return window!!Gave it two stars because the other one works and you can't beat the price.
3,It worked,But was slightly damaged when it arrived and did not last nearly as long as the toner cartridges I now buy locally.
3,not a great quality,"Price was very good, delivery fast, but the ink is not sharp, printing is fuzzy, not sharp. If you need a good quality of printing, I do not recommenced this product."
5,my input on ink cartridge,"I really liked this product because of the price and quality of the product. The price was cheaper than in the stores. I went on line and it was there, the price was definetly cheaper than in the stores that I went to which included Best Buy, Office Depot, and Office Max. Best Buy and Office Depot did not have any in stock. Office Depot I thought was to high. Went home and went on line. Bingo."
4,good enough,"The first cartridge I received did not work -- it made a loud grinding noise. The Databazaar staff was friendly and helpful, and the RMA process was excellent. The replacement cartridge was packaged so much better than the first that it must have been a different brand. It works fine. Overall I think this cartridge is a good value, as long as you can afford the time for the possible RMA."
2,"decent print quality, very short life","The title says it all. This worked well in my ML2010 but I only got about 800 pages. You might get ""up to 3000"" pages of you're printing blank pages. This seems to do not quite as well s one of the starter cartridges they ship with new printers. Amazing that the manufacturer would elect to save few cents on toner and lose repeat business. I won't buy this brand again."
2,Not very good,"I don't use my printer much at all, so after replacing my Samsung with this cartridge and printing less than a couple hundreds of printouts at most, the printouts are barely visible on the right side.I refilled it myself recently, and I got good printouts on the right side, but the left side would be visible but very faded.I did research on the internet and my understanding is that the brand new cartridge can only be refilled at most 3 times. The one I got could have been refilled too many times already, so that may explain why my printouts are not good after a couple hundreds of printouts, and even after I refilled it again."
2,Compatible Replacement Toner Cartridge/Samsung ML-2010D3,"I have ordered replacement toner cartridges in the past, however, this was not the same quality. Print quality poor;toner smudges on page. Very disappointed."
5,comapatable toner for Samsung,What a value for the money! Would do busines this this company again. A compatable toner cartridge for Samsung 2010.
2,"Some are great, some are not","Great cartridge - cheap price. I use it in my classroom printer. Will buy from them again.UPDATE April 2012: I've bought this cartridge 4 times, and the last one was a dud. Light printing, streaky, almost as bad as the empty toner cartridge I replaced. Unfortunately I waited over a month to test it out, so I'm past the return window. I may not buy this cartridge again."
4,A great printer cartridge replacement,"I buy this print cartridge as a replacement for my old one in my ML-2010. The item is well packaged. The instructions is easy to follow. I do remember to give it about 8-10 shakes before putting it in. Like many other have noticed, the print darkness is not as dark as the original cartridge. However, one can change the darkness of a print in the printing option.Making this change means the expected print count will be less. However, given the amount of saving, I think that this product deserves a 4 star. 5-star would have meant it is a perfect/identical replacement for the genuine cartridge from Samsung."
1,Data Bazaar: Fast Delivery: Bad Product,"This review if about product purchased from DataBazaar only.Worked only for 6 months. Usually, my cartridges last 3 years. Claims 3000 pages, my estimate is that it gave me 800 pages. Waste of money and time. Go with another vendor that provides support and responds to e-mails. I got mine from DataBazaar."
1,50% of the cost with 0% of the function,"I saw other positive reviews on Amazon and decided it would be worth it to take a chance. The package arrived very fast from Databazaar and it was well wrapped.The toner installed easily, and it worked perfectly for about a week. One day I started printing a document and a horrible buzzing noise emanated from the printer and the error light went on. After taking the thing apart and trying different fixes, I have never been able to get a proper print since then.I would buy the licensed one if I did it all over."
2,Spotty Performance,It leave small areas with no print. I should return it but it is not worth the trouble. My students will just have get use to it for awhile.
1,Did Not Work,"Like some of the other reviewers, this imitation toner cartridge did not work with my Samsung printer either. I thought I would end up saving a lot of money by buying this instead of the manufacture's actual toner cartridge. In the end it just ended up costing me more, because I'm going to need to buy the real thing now. Word of advice, don't buy it. Just go with the real thing. It may seem more expensive, but you'll be saving yourself money when it actually works."
3,not even close to 3000 page yield,"Though this is much cheaper than buying the original, I got nowhere close to a 3000 page yield. If you're looking for a cheaper alternative without getting ripped off, I would suggest this:Laser Tek Services Toner Refill Kit 3 Pack Compatible with Samsung ML 2010 ML-2510 ML2010D3 Dell 1100Only $25 for three refills that last a long time!"
1,Bad! Bad! Bad!,"I have ordered these from ECoolMart and the quality of the cartridge is horrible. The gears on these are stuck, because it won't even feed the paper through to print.Compatible Replacement for the Samsung? ML-2010D3 Toner Cartridges (ML2010D3) - Black, 3000 Yield"
1,Buyer Beware,"Bought this item from ""fuller international corporation"".The toner cartridge does not have even coverage across the page (i.e. text on the right side of the page comes our light gray instead of black). Changing your printer settings to use more toner does not help enough to make it black (i.e. Settings include: ""Darken Text"" and ""Print all text as black"" and ""Toner Save Mode: OFF"")I would not buy this product again."
1,Does NOT Work!,"I rarely write bad reviews, but this one surely deserves it, and I wish Amazon would allow us to give it 0 stars. I went to return this item today, and the return window expired yesterday:(This product does not work! It makes our printer overheat, it just makes a loud noise and that's it. It's not printing, so I cannot tell you how the print quality is.Save your money, do not buy this product!"
1,Didn't work,"After a couple of days the cartridge stopped working. I'm going to order an official one from Samsung. This is the second time that a ""compatible"" toner cartridge failed. Thank goodness for Amazon's great return policy."
1,Don't Waste your Money,I bought two of these toner cartridges since the price seemed very good. I should have known the price was too good. The first cartridge would not work at all. The paper jammed everytime the printer tried to feed it through. I tried the second cartridge and it works some of the time. Is this good enough? NO! Save yourself the frustration and buy something else. I'm really amazed the Amazon puts their reputation on the line with a product such as this. They should be ashamed of selling something like this.
2,Leaving big streaks down left hand side,I guess I should of brought the actual Samsung toner. This knock off one is leaving two big streaks down the left hand side of every print. I guess cheaper doesn't mean it works.
1,Less Than 600 Pages Before Toner Runs Low,"The toner worked perfectly for the first 550 pages or so. After that, it prints poorly as if it is running out. This cartridge is supposed to print 3,000 sheets so it has printed only one fifth the number of pages it is supposed to. Since it is only slightly less than half the price of a Samsung cartridge, this is no bargain."
4,works good,"The cartridge installed easily in my Samsung ML-2010. The printing looks good. As noted in another review, the print appears to be slightly darker than with the original Samsung cartridge. I take this as a plus. I'm glad I saved the money!"
1,Received wrong model,"I ordered ML-1210 and received the 2010 model instead. I have no use for it.Because of complications (time and money)associated with return policies, I decided to never ever again buy from AMAZON."
3,Did not work but the vendor did,"I really can't comment on the product quality because it didn't work. I was having problems with the printer so in all fairness I can't say that it was one thing or the other. What was most important about this transaction was that the vendor gave excellent customer service. They immediately responded to my email, took back both cartridges no questions asked and pre-paid the postage. So, my advice is given the expense of the cartridge it is worth a try WITH A RESPONSIVE, QUALITY VENDOR!! When things DON'T work vendor integrity kicks in!! I gave the Amazon vendor Great Toners a five star rating!!"
4,no problems. Cheaper the OEM product,The product works well in my device. Much cheaper then the purchasing the OEM product.
4,Good Toner,I have received the package in good condition and just started using it. So far the print quality is excellent. Item was delivered on time.
1,Replacement Toner,"Product does not fit the ML-2510 Samsung printer, though it is advertised as a replacement. Do not buy for this printer"
2,"Works, But Not Well","After seeing such a low cost for this product, I decided that it was worth taking a risk on a generic toner cartridge rather than paying the extra money for the name brands. It works, but just not very well.Things started out great with the cartridge producing crisp, rich, black text equivalent to what I had seen with much more expensive cartridges. But, after a few weeks, I've noticed that the cartridge is failing to properly print things on the far left side of the page.If you're printing things for yourself (to-do lists, directions, etc.) then this low-cost alternative to a name brand toner cartridge will work great for you! But, if you're printing things for school or work, you'll want to spend the extra money to ensure you're getting quality, reliable printing."
1,They're kidding about the number of pages it can produce!,"They're really kidding about the number of pages it can produce!I've got a Samsung ML-2525W laser for which I ordered this cartridge from Amazon.The seller [i8 International Inc] claims that this is a""NEW COMPATIBLE Samsung ML-2010D3 toner cartridge, black delivers up to 3,000 pages. ""I've installed this cartridge on April 10th, 2012 and as of July 20th it started showing that it's empty. For the record, I've gone through only ONE ream of paper, that's 500 pages, and under normal type of text document printing, i.e. not having big areas of solid dark images.I'm flabbergasted as to the seemingly low volume of toner inside this ""high-capacity"" cartridge. Truthfully, I've gotten to print more pages from a starter cartridge!I would not recommend this cartridge from i8 International to my friends. Better go elsewhere!"
3,"Worked fine, but didn't last long.","Five to six months after I bought this, the ink started to run out. It did work while it lasted, and I would order again because even if I buy two a year, it's cheaper than spending $80 on the samsung toner."
4,What a bargain,"This is my second compatible print cartridge for my Samsung printer. The first was terrible (from a different company). This one has performed very well so far for several hundred pages. Printing seems to be slightly lighter than ""normal"", but I could probably tweak that in my settings. Worth the low price."
1,NOT Compatible; Did NOT work; DataBazaar Refused Replacement,"JUNK - DO NOT BUY from Datazaar - This product is NOT compatible with Samsung, and probably lacks correct CHIP; When my current cartridge was finished, I tried one of these 2 I had just bought from Databazaar, and did NOT work - when I tried later to get COMPATIBLE replacement from DataBazaar or refund, they refused because ""30 days had passed"" -How RIDICULOUS - people only use new cartridge when old one finished, and no normal consumer will open and ""try"" a new one until old one is finished. So DataBazaar is punishing consumers who plan ahead - if 30 days passes from Databazaar purchase, you are OUT OF LUCK with this company. My suggestion is buy from company with 1-year guarantee-warranty. I have now gone back to company I used for many years. Incidentally, Amazon did nothing but act as e-mail intermediary-- I don't know the value of A-to-Z."
1,Good News ... Bad News,"The price was right; so much less expensive than buying directly from Dell Computer. The package arrived ahead-of-schedule, and the packaging was exceptional: recycled cardboard, air-filled packing instead of styrofoam. Initial print quality was better than when Dell 1100 printer was brand-new. I was thrilled! All that I EXPECT when buying through Amazon.But then the Bad News!While advertised as a 2000 copy cartridge, at slightly over 1000 copies it became unreadable. And these were primarily text copies not graphics, photos, etc.Happy-at-first, but won't buy Sophia again."
1,"""Do Not Buy This"" in my opinion.","The box came in the mail slightly opened. The cartridge comes in a bag. I tore the bag open and the toner dust immediately went all over my face, up my nose, in my clothes and hands. The cartridge was covered in toner dust.The instructions that came with the toner explained that a tape like string must be pulled from the toner before using it. The string had been removed before the toner arrived.I placed the cartridge in the printer and the printer did not recognize that the toner cartridge was inserted.I removed the toner cartridge and threw the toner out. There cartridge left toner residue in the printer itself."
1,Bad quantity,The quality was good while the toner lasted but ran out after less than 500 sheets. I've had to constantly open up my machine and shake the cartridge to maximize what I can out of it.
2,Take your chances,"After reading the reviews, I decided to take my chances since this option is so much cheaper than the original. After installing the toner, I printed a few test sheets and discovered the green drum that applies the toner to the paper was deeply scratched, which caused it to print the scratch marks repeatedly across all documents. Needing to print some time-sensitive documents and not wanting to drive to Kinko's, I decided to remove the drum from the old cartridge and install in the new one, which resolved the issue. It is not terribly difficult but is messy dealing with the toner. Remove the 4 screws on the ends of the cartridge, then the 2 screws on the top of the cartridge, which allows the top piece to be removed. This allows the two end caps to be removed at which point it becomes obvious how to remove the drum. Not a great option but better than sending it back and wasting the time for a return."
1,You get what you pay for,"It is not expensive. Supposed to last up to 3000 pages? I've counted, and around 250, starts image defects, ghosting, like it's running out of toner. After a shake, it works for another 10 or so pages. Not worth the trouble"
1,started jamming after about 20 pages,"The first 15 or so pages were fine, but it started jamming more and more frequently after that -- I tried a couple of different types of paper and it happened with all of them.AVOID THIS!"
1,Ran out of ink in 3 weeks,"When I first got this product it worked great, but the ink only lasted about 3 weeks. I've had other toner cartridges last months and months with the same kind of use, but this one is already useless."
1,Don't buy - gave out at 1000 pages,The cartridge worked great for the first couple months I had it. However the toner page count is at 937 and it looks streaky. I have to take it out and shake it but that is only good for another 10 pages or so. I suspect that the cartridge was not full or there is a defect in the product.Buy it if you are ok with only 1000 page yield from a 3000 page promise.
1,Low quality,It prints a vertical stripe down the right edge of every page. It is supposed to print up to 3000 pages but ran out of ink after printing less than 500. Very low quality product.
2,Far less than 3000 pages...,"The title says it all. I went through less than three 500 count packs of paper before this thing ran dry. It's been about 13 months since I purchased it, so I can't send it back. But I won't buy another one."
1,don't buyfit,"fits perfectly in my brother 2040 but the printer does not recognize the cartridge, it does not print and the company does not respond to my email for return authorization"
5,One of our favorite childrens' books,"We have read many, many childrens' books with our three children and this remains one of our favorites. It's exotic and funny, fun for girls and boys and has a nice lesson."
3,Not quite for beginners,"I have to agree with Kelly1Kanobee. This book is not for newcomers to the language. If as a beginner I had picked up this book, I would have gone no further than Chapter 2.The author, a French professor approaches the language from a linguistic perspective, introducing the beginner to unnecessary exceptions and idiosynchirises. The key to learning I believe is to equip the reader with the ability to read, write and speak very early on in the learning process, albeit the ability to construct short, basic sentences. This book will not allow for this.The only thing you will take away from the early chapters is the ability to count to 1000.I would highly recommend the French for Dummies book, its a simple and comprehensible approach to the language.I found this text very useful for me since it allowed me to recall my long lost high school French, and become familiar with the language again, after 10 years."
1,Died on the first cut,"I`d been wanting a Tiger Saw for a while, and finally a home improvement project came along to justify buying one. Literally six inches into my FIRST cut, the saw died. I could get it going again by slapping the side of it while pulling the trigger, but it would cut out again within seconds. I returned it and bought the real deal--a Milwaukee Sawzall. A swiveling, rotating blade would be awesome (and I could have used it later in the project), but only if the saw works in the first place! Maybe I just got a turd, but I returned it and bought a Sawzall instead, and have been cutting away happily ever since."
2,"Great saw, poor service","I've been shopping at Amazon for a few years now and have been very satisfied with my purchases until today when I received my order. I paid for a new saw and I received an obviously used ( scratches everywhere, missing accessory, missing registration card). I understand that Amazon receives many return items then repack to sell, but I don't think its fair for me as a buyer to receive a less than a complete unit. I wonder about a nail gun I just ordered as to what condition it will be upon arrival? From now on I will get anything other than books and CDs from local hardware stores. Otherwise the tiger saw appeared to be a great product."
2,blade clamp broke after two uses,"When I saw this tool I knew I had to have it. Before I used it I was really impressed with the build quality and various positions. After my first use, cutting thin angle iron, I was very happy I bought this saw. I was able to use the adjustable head on my second use, cutting plywood from the attic, and still very happy. On my third use, I couldn't get the blade to stay in, and that's when I noticed that half the shaft was gone! The saw had less than 5 minutes of use! Looking at what was left of the shaft bothered me. The part that broke off didn't look like it had much metal holding it in the first place. I don't know if mine was defective, or if excessive blade vibration can damage the shaft, but now I am scared to get another one, though I wish I could and feel comfortable. There is no other saw like it!"
5,Great Saw,"Great power, balance, and versatility. Please note: this is a professional grade tool. It can be hard to handle, and tiring to hold. If you have the strength to use it, it is great."
3,"loose chuck, swivels","This was cool at first, probably after 20 uses, maybe fewer, the chuck started getting a little shaky, and later began to rotate, making it difficult to cut smoothly and in a straight line. It now swivels 3/8"", and is useless for fine surgical demo work. Just use it for hacking now. I might take it apart and see what's going on inside. I'll have to buy a new saw anyway, and can't trust porter cable to fix it to my satisfaction. Too many moveable parts I'm thinking. Had it 7 yrs."
5,Great saw,This is a great saw. Plenty of power and the versatillity to get leverage on cuts that you could not gain with any other saw. If you have a need for a recip saw this is the one.
4,Wonderfully strange tool,"I bought the tool for a reasonably specific task, which it did very well. I does vibrate considerably when in strange positions, but nothing else does what it does. It has plenty of power. These are not a tool used for extended periods, so the vibration is OK. Needless to say I have not yet used it in every position, but I suspect people who have owned them for years haven't either."
5,Unique Perspective of Flying Boats,"There are a number of well-illustrated books on flying boats and commercial operations employing them. This video provides a unique added dimension to the stories; not new information but film and still sources that expand our sense of how exceptional these huge aircraft were for their time. Still pictures and text cannot convey the drama and luxury of air travel across the Pacific. All the books I have on the Clippers and flying boats miss this emotional experience. This DVD does for Pan Am and it's brief history of Clipper operations what ""Triumph of Will"" does for the the history of the Nuremberg rallies"
3,One man's opinion. I am glad I purchased the book but....,"The book gave quite a bit of very useful background information about; indian food, the dishes in the book ,ingredients and other. I cant say much about the info because I did not read much and I dont remember a lot about what I did read. It was good information, but I wanted and was expecting many more recipes. If you add about 100 more recipes it would be an excellent book. There is about one recipe every two or three pages and there are about 175 pages but the first 35 pages have no recipes. Many of the recipes are similar. I know that there are many more indian dishes. peace out"
4,Now this is authentic Indian food - Glad it's back in print,"Most food lovers aren't aware of the regional variety and vast differences in India's cuisine. This book, which I first acquired in the 1970's, is superb both in terms of accuracy (duplicating the right flavor) and bringing lesser-known items to the Westerner's table, less rich and more balanced nutritionally. Try things you haven't heard of, like the yogurt soup (Kadi) or if you never liked Okra, the recipe with tumeric, mustard seeds and yogurt may convert you... And you don't have to be vegetarian to enjoy it"
4,highly recommended,"I could wish there were more illustrations, but overall, I have already recommended this book to others over other books with pretty pictures in them. This book gives explanations lacking in other books. The history behind the food speaks more than just a collection of recipes. I have already made two dishes from this book, and they have turned out well."
5,New title - same great sound!,Found a new issue of this item but only on Amazon.ca - sound is spectacular! Has new artwork and same tracks all super sound quality.
5,Can't buy it anywhere,Maybe one of you owners of DigDeep can help me out. I have been trying to purchase this CD for what seems like years...always just miss it being in stock or up for bid in eBay. Do you maybe have a 'backup'copy you could spare...we could work something out I'm sure?Thanks...Bill
2,I was hoping for more.,"I was disappointed to find this book geared more towards students who were returning to school rather than to the undergraduate seeking a higher degree. There were certain areas that were extremely helpful, while other sections were almost discouraging to the prospective student. There were sections that provided some insight into writing the statement of purpose and financial aid sources, but still seemed to be geared towards either students seeking Ph.D's or students returning to school after a period of time. I have to say I was a disappointed."
4,Wow...,"This album has what all the major label rap releases these days lack: that rawness. Anyone that loves hip hop but hates what it sounds like nowadays should go peep this album for an example of how it SHOULD sound. The crazy thing is that the label who put these guys out is owned by CARSON DALY?!?! Anyways pick up this album, you won't be disappointed unless you're looking for the next j-kwon, nelly or chingy."
3,Nice stuff,"This is a blues / christian band. They are good musicians. The CD recording quality isn't great, but I have purchased stuff that was recorded worse. The vocals are a little weak, but the band still lays it down. More of a modern electic guitar driven blues."
1,An expensive folly,"My first Swingline 520e last about a year. It just suddenly stopped working. We hardly used it and certainly didn't stuff it. It just stopped working. Because we still had tons of Swingline staple cartridges, we bought another 520e. Very stupid mistake. The second one lasted about 9 months, as a usage rate of about twice a week.These staplers are lemons and you should stay away. I am here on Amazon trying to find another better model."
1,A lot of money to jam every time,Very disappointed with this stapler. It jams constantly to point where I threw it in the garbage today. For the price I would have expected this unit to last for years but it has been jamming since it came out of the box. We're going back to the old fashion method today.
5,"5000, staples in one","This stapler replaced the same one that we purchased 20 years ago, and it is used constantly every day. We love it"
5,Birthday gift,It appears to be in good shape but have not unpacked box yet. Everything arrived in a timely fashion.Thanks for the good service.
1,HP officeJet 7410 purchase,"This product suddenly stopped working this morning. I have no idea what is wrong with it. I have checked all connections and nothing is loose. Question now is, where do I go from here?"
3,Great - but auto feed messes up frequently,"I have had this printer for a while - at least 3 years, maybe 5. It is generally very good, the only complaint is the auto feed messes up (and getting worse). I probably mis-feeds paper 50% of the time. You have to stand nearby to make sure it is feeding properly, and with some coaxing with your hand you can get them to feed."
1,Run from this Unit!,"Software stinks, phone help is in India and can't understand them (1 dollar a hour you get what you pay for)and useless help. buy the new model was the latest advice!Wireless is junk.Has broke twice ( thank god for my personel I.T. guy. ) cheap plastic HP should pay me for all the time I spent working on this thing"
1,Getting it recycled is the final insult,"I used this printer in a small office for 3 years and it was adequate to the job. Apparently the board died because it will no longer boot up. I've spent the last week trying to get an address from HP to have this item recycled and NO LUCK. I simply refuse to put this hunk of plastic in the landfill. HP advertises free recycling of all their products but, so far, they are not standing by the statement.Update: I finally did get an address to return this printer to HP. It took about a week of trying but finally I found the right person."
3,Too many issues for the price...,"I bought this two-tray printer to stack paper to the bootom tray and envelopes to the top one in order to print any of them as needed. I was wrong - this monster defaults to the top tray (the smaller one) only, thus leaving you with the need to remove the paper and replace it with envelopes each time - pretty weak for a $500 machine! Two, peer-to-peer networking did not work. It may be otherwise a dream machine, but I returned it as it did not fulfill my needs."
4,HP OfficeJet 7410 All-in-One,"So far the print quality is excellent. I bought this to print newsletters, etc. on both sides of the paper in color. (This costs up to 25 per page from print shops. At 1000+ pages, this is prohibitively expensive.) This is a bit slow because it waits for the ink to dry on the first side before it prints the second side. But the print quality is worth waiting for. I am disappointed that even the 'large' ink cartridges are much smaller than on my Deskjet 712-C, so I have to change them more frequently. But that is my only complaint."
5,I love this machine,"I don't know who the retards are who wrote the reviews before me but I am glad I didn't listen to them. This machine is great. It couldn't have been easier to install and I am up and running and printing wirelessly from all my computers in my home network. You can also scan pictures and documents and then send the file wirelessly back to any computer on the network with the included software installed. I just bought my machine today so I haven't learned all the features yet since there are so many!I just wanted to submit a review to counter all these other reviews saying the install process was hard, because I almost didn't buy this machine because of what I read on here. Don't be fooled, this machine is great!"
2,HP is a joke,"Ive had this printer for 3 years now and, tonight, im having to re-install the support software for this turd on a new machine. In all honesty the printer isnt so bad. Im not a printer geek so i dont know how it really compares. For me, its quick enough, pictures come out clear enough, ink lasts long enough. However, all the support stuff that you take for granted...like...i dont know...putting the driver cd in your machine and having a nice, quick, clean install....forget about it. HP should be assamed of the software they built for this thing. Its a joke. Good luck trying to get this running..and if you do get it goin, let me introduce you to your new best friend. His name is ""Spooler.exe experienced a fatal error"". Have fun with him, cause you get to see him often. How this thing got out the door i have no idea, but feel free to ask rajeeve, he will have a non-coherent answer for ya."
1,Fax won't work with Comcast Cable,"This printer / scanner/ fax machine worked great for a while. Suited all my needs. And then I got Comcast Cable .. and apparently this unit will not fax with Comcast Cable. HP was aware of the issue when I first brought it up over 4 years ago, but they had no solution. I have kept the printer/scanner for almost five years now because it's a great machine (although at this point it's a little dated) ... but if you really need to fax on a regular basis and you have Comcast Cable, you need to look elsewhere. HP still does not have a fix that I can find."
1,Piece of junk,I had the HP 7410 for 16 months and the carriage malfunctioned. The printer could not be repaired and a $400 unit was worthless after less than 500 copies. HP would not give me the time of day.
2,"Good Printer, While it lasted, Worst Software ever made.","Printer had great quality and all the features you could want. The wireless software was awful. So, I usually connected via USB. Bought it when it first came out ( almost $500 then ). It lasted about 18 months, maybe a little longer. Then the black print cartridge slot failed. I took it in to be repaired. Could not get parts any longer. Never buy an expensive printer, as HP has decided that all printers are disposable commodities, and aren't supposed to last long or be repaired."
5,No problems at all after a year and a half!,I don't know what everyone is taking about a design flaw. This product is excellent in every way and is a very fast printer. The wireless networking feature is by far the best feature on this printer and lets you put it just about anywhere (as long as you are within you wireless signal). I highly recommend it!
4,A Great Mulit-Function Printer,"I use this printer everyday. It meets my every need. My only wish would be that the color ink cartridges would be separated. I do not like having to purchase a new color cartridge knowing that there is still ink in there. However, I have no complaints with it's function. I get to save paper with the duplexer, also. I am very satisfied with this machine."
1,"If you travel or use wireless, DON'T EVEN CONSIDER this product","HP driver software is junk - you probably already know that - but if you intend to use this printer in wireless mode and intend to travel with your laptop to a different network, you can count on your computer locking up. HP will guide you through a re-install, which will take you about 1 hour, each time you change networks. Your computer will be unusable until you complete this process. If you can live with that each time you change networks, this product is for you!HP acknowledges this problem exists, that they have known about it since 2005, and there is no solution available."
1,$600 for one year till breakdown -- hunk of junk,"after 1 year and 2 weeks -- yep, on a one-year warranty -- my 7410 displayed ""carriage jam"" and the best support could do was tell me to take a $50 discount on a different HP printer. i said ""do you mean it's garbage now?"" and he said ""yep"". and much web searching confirmed it. what a deal. i'll never buy HP again. it was pretty noisy anyway, but i figured i'd get more ROI than i did. support person had a who-cares attitude, too."
5,Quick response to defective printer,"We bought the Officejet 7410 in December 2005 but didn't hook it up right away as we were planning an upgrade to our computer. When we finally installed the printer in late January 2006, we had problems with copying. The document feeder didn't work-and even copying with document on the glass didn't always work. The day we set it up and discovered the problem, we were on the phone with HP tech support for 1 1/2 hours as the technician tried to find out what was wrong. He finally determined we had a defect and offered to ship us a new printer. This was on a Sunday-the new printer arrived the following Wednesday-now that's responsive customer service-which should be the norm but often isn't. The replacement is up and running fine."
1,Ok for the short term,"I found this printer easy to install. Wireless worked great. And the copy, scan, print and fax reception worked well - never did get fax sending to work. After about 18 months the printer cartdrige alignment failed - though it can be fixed for 200 bucks. And now there's new error! It's not easy to find the error (let alone the resolution) on the HP site. I'm a light user - this is my home machine. I'd not recommend it to anyone who needs a machine for medium to heavy use, nor to anyone who is looking for a machine to use for more than a year."
1,Poorly Made - Can't Be Repaired,"The 7410 is my 2nd HP All-In-One. It replaced a 7100. Neither lasted more than 14 months. The 7410 did everything they said it would, but recently I tried to replace a black cartridge (which I have done without incident before) and started getting strange error messages. After 2 hours with tech support they told me it was a hardware problem. These machines can't be repaired, you have to replace them. Their accommodation was to offer to sell me a new one at about the same price as on Amazon. Big deal. My 7100 had to be replaced because the document feeder went bad. These are too fragile for any type of regular use and just won't last. If you are dead set on buying one, you should get an extended warranty which makes the machine must more expensive. I am going to try another brand."
3,Good for light multi-tasking,"We use this printer in a small office environment and it isvery useful as printer,scanner,copier,and fax. This is meant for small or home office use and sometimes this shows the limits of the machine - mostly if you have a large amount of copies to do or a large fax.The only real complaint I have is the paper feeder at the top - the same complaint I had on the earlier HP predecesor we had which the 7410 replaced. The feeder gets hung up and does not want to grab fax pages from time to time and makes a simple task into a long drawn out process."
5,great machine,"This is the greatest office machine I have ever used. It does everything it is supposed to do and it does it well. No hassles, no problems."
1,Terrible software,"Installation is terrible with lots of bugs. Look at the HP site and you will see a long list of fixes. Your job is to try to figure out which one is the one that will work for you. When the other reviews mentioned ""several hours"" they were right. The best advice was from an Amazon review here. The reviewer correctly advised to uninstall Mcafee. That works. Nowhere on the HP site is that mentioned so you wade through the trial and errors trying to fix the installation. The product works but it is a real shame that HP never tested the installation and allow customers to go through this mess. The one star rating is for the software installation. You will see if you buy this."
5,Nice baby gift with great presentation,"Item is heavy and of good quality; perfect for a baby shower gift. It comes boxed in a cream colored box with satin lining which is very attractive. My item had something sticky across the top, but it scrapped off with little effort."
3,Not One of His best Albums,"It is good but not that good - not many songs grabbed me. It is kinda commercial in its sound, not as thought provoking or real as some of his other albums."
2,This does not fit the Taurus Tracker .22lr or .17hmr models even though it comes up in the search,"Bought this as the second attempt to find a scope mount for my .17HMR 6.5"" Tracker. It didn't work. But being stubborn I tried to glass bed the mount to ""make"" it fit only to discover that the mount had warped during my previous efforts to get it to fit flush and square. It may work ok on the larger model Trackers but it will not fit the rimfire versions. The main reason for my low rating however is that it warped under very little stress while mounting."
1,A real shame,"This is the first of the shameful series of Boxcar Children books that were written long after the author's death. The first 19 are wonderfully written classics of children's literature. The rest, for the most part, are pointless fluff, not engaging for parents or most children. If you are reading them all to your children, and in order, they will also become very confused here: Throughout Warner's original series, the characters aged and matured quite a bit. Starting with this book, they are inexplicably returned to and perpetually stuck at their original ages."
4,Surprises,It was full of surprises and I liked that a lot. I also really liked the ending of the book.
4,"Not many books on this topic out there, and this is a good one","I like Herschell Gordon Lewis's books. I've bought and readseveral. He has an approach that emphasizes subtleties ofthe craft of writing. This may turn you on, it may turn youoff... but whatever the case, his books on writing copy arevaluable and in a class of their own - because they are different.Lewis tends to analyze bad ads in his books, pick them apartand suggest ways to make them better. He doesn't show a lotof great ads. He shows how to make average or poor ads better.To me this makes sense, because when writing copy it's hardto always be inspired. You do the best you can on the firstdrafts with the raw material you have: the product.Lewis shows how to make those early, stinky drafts much betterthrough a system of identifying common mistakes in advertisingwriting and sensible ways of correcting those mistakes. It'sa short-cuts approach for when you aren't being brilliant butstill need to get the writing done."
4,Beautiful Costume,This was truly a beautiful costume. My 4 yo girl just loved it. We wanted to purchase it at the store but they were sold out in September. It must have been popular but we didn't see anyone else wearing one. Everyone who saw her in it thought she was very cute. She now wears it around the house during playtime.I do wish they had some matching crown and wand (we found something that worked locally). Party America shipped it out promptly.
3,not for long term use,I bought this for my daughter for Halloween with the idea of keeping it in her dress up box afterwards. The colors are more pinky than what you see on the picture. She enjoyed her costume on Halloween but the fabric is very cheap and tears easily - it didn't last more than that night. The wings are nice but started drooping within a few hours. My daughter was very happy with it - she was 2 1/2 when she wore it. She is in the 90th percentile for height and weight and we bought th 3T-4T size which fit just fine.
4,Pretty Butterfly,"My daughter got this in the mail today and we tried it on right away. She is 5 and not a very big girl, but the costume will not be able to be worn with a jacket under it on Halloween night. We live in ND so a lot of our Halloweens are cold so a jacket needs to be worn either under or over a costume. I always try to get costumes a bit big so that the jacket doesn't have to cover the costume. I am not sure how she is going to wear this Halloween night but I will do what I can to make it work because she really wants this costume. Now we just have to see how it holds up that night."
4,Beautiful gown,"This is a beautiful dress, however the original picture is deceiving concerning the wings for they look wonderfully large, they aren't! The personal picture is proportionality correct. We opted to find other wings, the older your child is the smaller the wings appear on them."
2,"Not as pictured, size not accurate, poor durability.","My granddaughter loved it but I was a bit disappointed. First, the size runs small. My granddaughters size 6 are always roomy but this size 6x is TIGHT and I worry about the weak seams to tear on Halloween. Second, the wings are not as pictured, they see not the same shape or large size. The attachment of the wings is flimsy. They would not stay on after 15 minutes of try on time. The velcro patches actually fell off the wings so I will be sewing them on before Halloween.If my granddaughter had not seen it first I would have returned it and bought something else. Not worth the money."
2,Too Big!,I ordered this costume in a small which said ages 3+ for my four year old daughter. FAIL. It is about 8 inches too long for her and she is actually considered tall for her age. Way too long. The wings only velcro on so they come off easily. It is a pretty costume and seems a little bit better made than other cheap costumes we've purchased but it's so long! The top fits fine so clearly someone overestimated how long to make it. Will be returning.
5,"This is the best CD, it's a complete mix of all my faves","I'm listening to it right now, and I can truthfully say it makes writing this review that much better"
3,Feeling adventurous,"I'd only heard, and liked, a few of these songs so really didn't have an idea of what he was like. Probably not my usual thing, but interesting, none-the-less, as a piece of history."
1,Khoti Jhinjoti,"Although The Khans are playing in the framework of Jhinjoti, it seems to be a mish mash from various renditions of the raga performed by many other artists. There is even a Maihar element to it, it is true Jhinjoti is a light raga and can be performed in a less conservative manner but that doesnt reserve the concept of blatently combining phrases taken from different artists. Also the Sarode is played in the manner of the Sitar which is not a sacrilege, but it clashes with the Surbahar. There are some intresting taans that are worth having in ones collection.The Pilu on the other hand is very esoteric Villayat Khan, and is the better one of the two. I would purchase this album, and this is because the listener gets glimpses from many other traditions"
4,"Looks good, but don't trust the picture!","My comments are for the hitch made for a 2006 Murano.The black paint on one end arrived majorly chipped and is flaking off. (Touch-up paint to the rescue.) The hitch is a straight bar, rather than one with a slight curve to it as in the picture. Only the hitch and mounting hardware are included, not the tongue-thingy as in the picture. No comment on the installation as I haven't gotten to that yet..."
2,Weak the Real P?,"sure this album features Bootsy, BlackByrd, Garry Shider, and others - but its probably the weakest P-Funk album out there. The tracks are flimsy and artificial sounding, and Garry's Voice is manipulated way too much. Track 2 sounds like a Cameo rip-off, and throughout the album its clear that this was thrown together to get something out there - not a whole lot of effort by The Mob on this oneI think many of the songs have potential if played in a different way. With more real instruments, less electronics, less studio editing, and more groove, these songs could be soooo much better. But then they'd be a whole diff'rnt thang.Sou47 StarchildMore Bounce"
2,... can one track carry an album?,"I bought this CD twice. First time 'cause it's got GEORGE's name on it, second 'cause ""Nice"" is ""NICE!"", PERIOD! If supporting the booty-cal research of our good Dr. Funk aint yo' thing, save yo' T-Bills, Dig!"
1,Blaming the victim,"Joshua Hammer believes that suicide bombings are always inexcusable but that the Israelis bear some responsibility in bringing the attacks on themselves. This sentence is doublespeak. If you believe that blowing up innocent people is always inexcusable, then there IS no ""but."" If you add the ""but,"" then you clearly don't believe that such attacks are ALWAYS inexcusable. Hammer is blaming the victim, much like someone who says, ""Rape is always wrong, but sometimes women provoke it."" If Hammer is ever a victim of one of these attacks, and he is in the hospital recovering with a missing limb or with nails embedded in his body, I hope he will remember his own words and be willing to contemplate just what he did to deserve it."
1,Biased and inaccurate,A Season in Bethlehem : Unholy War in a Sacred Place is a biased and highly inaccurate book.Not much more to say.
3,I'm sorry but I just don't like this DVD,"The number one thing that irks me about this DVD, is that the narrator for the story is the same guy who does the narration for the previews etc. Granted, he has a GREAT voice for what he does, but it just doesn't suit me for reading a story to toddlers.Secondly, the animation didn't exactly match up with how the book is illustrated, there was a bit too much of a deviation and it didn't really quite feel like the book was being read on DVD. But I guess that may also be because the Scholastic DVD stories do stay true to the artwork that is in the books they are animating, and I appreciate that. My daughter really likes a lot of the Scholastic DVD stories, ESPECIALLY if she knows the book already, but despite her love of Eric Carle books, she has zero interest in watching this DVD.Plus, it's annoying to have to skip through all the Disney previews that are at the beginning."
3,if your kiddo likes the book...,"s/he should love this dvd! my toddler is obsessed with the book right now, so it only made sense that he would love this dvd. good purchase, just wish it included more of eric carle's stories."
5,Excellent for a 2 year old!,"We have scholastic books-on-movie format, such as the ""Goodnight Gorilla"", and this by far is the best I have seen. I love to watch it with my 2 year old before bedtime. It is the perfect way to wind down for a good night's sleep. She is enthralled by watching her favorite stories that we read together come to life. This is beautifully done with music, animation, and you can even have the words show (you need to choose the option for the hard of hearing, and the words will come up on the screen).Absolutely well done, Disney! I wish there were more out there like this one!"
1,NOT HAPPY,was not happy with the purchase - I thought it was a book on a cd. It will just go to Goodwill.
1,Nana Didn't Like this One,"I do not recommend this DVD and believe that advertisement contents should be noted in the description of the DVD. I bought this DVD for my grand daughter thinking it would be a ""library"" style DVD without commercials. We were very, very disappointed and unhappy that this DVD has a great number of Disney advertisements. I did not purchase this DVD to watch Disney commercias. My Daughter must fast forward through the commercials which defeats the ""moments of peace"" that DVD's provide to busy mothers."
2,HATE the Disney version!,"My two year old and I originally watched clips of this on YouTube and were utterly enchanted. I purchased the DVD and was very disappointed by the Disney narration. The original has British accents and a fairly dry delivery. The Disney version has that same guy who does the ""Look what's coming out of the Disney vault!"" commercials and his inflection is just awful. I will try to find a copy of the Scholastic version used and donate this one."
3,Not Exactly,"The animation is not exactly what it looks like in the book, but it's pretty close. I was a little disappointed. P.S. The packaging of this movie allows the movie to fall out of the round slot where it should be, so the movie ended up scratched, even before it was taken out of the shrink wrap."
3,"Bright and cheap, but bad power button","Just bought it new from amazon. It was ideal luminosity for commuting and price was great too, but the power button is difficult to press. It's pretty flat and doesn't have a good ""click"" / depression feel. It's not possible to press the button when wearing gloves or mittens (winter bike riding) and I'd have to expose my hands to the freezing temps to turn the light on. Also, the power button stopped working the first day out of the box. It took 10-20 presses before the light would turn on, and many more before it would turn off. I imagine I just got one from a bad batch, because Princeton Tec usually makes quality lights, so I returned the bad one and I'm awaiting a warranty replacement."
5,High Britness !,i use some bike lights because i am riding in night almostthis light is great and you can see so far in front and it is easy to installi high recommended this light for knight biking !
4,Good Book!,"I wrote this book, so I probably shouldn't review it -- but what the heck, here goes: It's not bad, especially where it concerns training paces and how to set them with a lactate analyzer. And the workouts are pretty insipid, but doable -- they will get you in the ballpark as concerns blood lactate. Buy it! You'll like it!"
4,Well worth the price!,"Barbara Metzger shines through with two of her classic regencies reprinted in this combo book. The first, ""An Affair of Interest,"" has a loose plot and it's hard to get into. How, the Metzger wit shines through. (I'd give this one 3 stars.)The second, ""Luck of the Devil,"" is one of my Metzger favorites. Definitely a 5-star book! This book is perhaps one of Metzger's most bittersweet. Again, the writing is superb, but also one of Metzger's most emotional books. I find myself holding back a tear each time I read it. Yet, somehow, the raw emotion this story evokes makes this tale a poignant classic.Any which way, I highly recommend this duel book.By the way, Barbara Metzger didn't write ""Sir Sham"" or ""Heart on His Sleeve."" Marion Devon wrote those."
4,got the goods,"Not really her best, but still better than the average Regency. Liked her ""Sir Sham"" and ""Heart on His Sleeve"" better, but if you like the Regency with a little humor, this is for you. Let's face it, the deadly serious, bordering on gothic style is not what we want in a Regency!"
4,A great political film.,I had first seen this film on HBO and I enjoyed it right away. I also thought that it was quite an ingenious idea for a movie. The idea to turn a Congressional Hearing for a scandal involving the President of the United States and members of his Cabinet into a political satire was very amusing. I personally enjoyed the subject of this film. It had both humorous and dramatic moments that were really exciting. This film was well-written and presented. It also had a great cast which gave convincing and effective performances. I really liked this film and I think that it's worth watching.
4,Greatest Industrial/Rock Band You've Never Heard Of...,"It's a shame that these guys and gal never achieved the success that they should've. Heavily influenced by Dessau, Ministry, Bile, Slayer and Fear Factory but with a keen ear for melody which all of the afforementioned acts so painfully lack. Sutur could've taken over where NIN left off, but alas they became just one more nail in the Industrial / Rock coffin."
4,Finzi orchestral works are a delight,"This is a marvelous introduction to Gerald Finzi, an underrated English composer whose conservatism left his music out of fashion in mid-century, but who is at last gaining deserved attention today. By all means listen to this and to the Northern Sinfonia's disc on Naxos, which offers another excellent Finzi collection. Those with vocal interests will love the exquisite song cycles on Hyperion (Varcoe & Hill w/Benson) and choral works on Chandos (Finzi Singers)."
3,A Trip Inside Westgate,"Most fans of westgate and Leilah Wendell will proberbly pick up a copy of this book. If you want some insight into westgate it isn't too boring of a read, don't get me wrong Kemp's writing although lacking somewhat is ok. However if your picking it up expecting it to be like Leilah's work it is not."
1,about EF! ?,"Unfortunately this book is not really about EF! I was looking forward to learning about the operations and organization of EF! but instead was confronted by the authors own autobiography, largley about his work as a private detective. I wish the book had dealt only with EF! and extremists environmentalists instead of the author himself. I feel like the author missed an opportunity to provide an interesting account of his dealings with EF! Aside from obvious content flaws, the book was also written poorly making it a confusing and monotonous read. At the same time, I am glad I read this book because it seems to be the only one of its kind."
3,Goldmine doesn't work with Windows Vista,"GM is powerful if you know what you are doing and willing to invest your time or have knowledgable in-house support.GM previously worked on W95, W98, W2000, and XP. Doesn't work with Vista. I am embarrassed for Microsoft and Frontrange Solutions both. Frontrange should have contacted their users and let them know to not buy Vista. They can send me ads for seminars but not to let me know how to avoid an expensive problem. Frontrange is about to release their 5 user / $750 version that does work with Vista. They have 1.7 million users that they don't care about.I have been using Goldmine for 10 years. STEEP learning curve. To avoid this hire a consultant at a high rate to get your system up and running."
1,"Old, frustrating software that is nigh impossible to upgrade","Word of warning: this software's official manual warns you that you may experience trouble when running it in Windows XP (!). Installing it in Vista or Win 7 is a gamble, and between the constant crashes and database rebuilds required for regular maintenance, the program runs sluggishly even on high-spec machines over a network.You could do much better than this, not recommended."
1,Pay for Goldmine three times over if you need support.,"The seduction is the software itself: its well laid out, intuitive, quick, flexible - everything you'd want. ONE HITCH: they have ABSOLUTELY NO SUPPORT execept at outrageous rates and very fuzzy definitions of ""help"" and ""problem"". They're like the Capital One ad's ""No!-man"". If I hadn't already spent so much of my time on it I'd junk it for ACT."
1,Worst Contact Software Ever! </ComicBookStoreGuy>,I've been working at a company that uses GM 6.5 for two years now and I must say that although it is pretty extensible (if you can actually get it running) it is buggy as heck. We actually have a Excel file of all the bugs we have found. Here's one I particularly enjoy: No undo functionality in emails. 90% of the time I end up writing my emails in Word or EditPlus and spellchecking there because a lot of times GM just crashes out when you run its spellchecker. Oh and their 'support' is awful. You have to pay out the nose to get any real help and their forums are usually useless.Worst contact software ever. Don't even bother.
1,Goldmine is not for salesmen,"I am a sales guy, not a tech, and when I bought this software I could not even load the software due to some error with something called BDE, there is help online which lead me to a website that does not exist. To get help you buy help from them in a minimum 3 hr block, and guess what it costs more than the software.So if you a sales person you need to find a better supported sofware, if you a tech you dont need this software.I did try and call and was passed from person to person and eventually just put on hold.If you plan to buy this software, good luck. You will needed to close a lot of business to pay for your wasted time."
3,I'VE NEVER BUY WITH THEM...,"VERY FEW INFORMATION ABOUT THE PRODUCT, THEY DIDN'T USE PICTURE, I MADE A MISTAKE AND ORDER THE PRODUCT.THEY DIDN'T ACCEPT AN RMA. AND THEY NEVER GIVE AN INSTRUCTION SHEET UNTIL I REQUEST IT."
5,The Renegade,"Sam seems to be good at getting into trouble, lately, and into situations she doesn't like. The Phantom seems to be appearing in places he shouldn't be, and the ranch is tight on money, a constant supply of worry for Dad and Gram. Then Jake has an accident, and the Phantom goes missing. Sam thinks that Karla Starr, the low-life rodeo contractor who doesn't play by the rules, has stolen him, but she has no proof.This was yet another excellent book in the Phantom Stallion series!! There was not much of Jake and his cleverness after the accident, but there was lots of action to make up for it, and humor and emotion, and even some sadness. All in all, excellent. Can't wait for the next one!"
5,another great book by Terri Farley,"In this book a lady named Karla Starr comes to town looking for bucking horses and mustangs. Sam's dad and Jake don't like Miss Starr and Sam's dad refuses to help her in any way, but Karla doesn't like taking 'no' for an anwser. One day Sam spots the Phantom's herd, but she is worried because the Phantom is not with them. She thinks that Karla Starr has captured the Phantom,but she is not sure. Will Sam ever find the phantom, be able to set him free, and earn his trust again? Read this book to find out!"
4,An exciting book about rodeos,"I like this book because it tells about wild horses and rodeos. A rodeo contractor tries to catch a wild horse that is special to Samantha Forrester and she tries to save him. Other books I like are: Red Feather Filly, also by Terri Farley and the Heartland series by Lauren Brooke. (3rd grade - 8 year old reviewer)"
5,good book!,this was a very exciting book! it keeps you hanging right up to the end! yet another great job by terri farley.
4,Good one!,"This book was written wonderfully and like the other books by Terri, they're written with 'excrusiating' detail! This one is filled with twists and turns and at some points it is hard to follow, but after a while you'll catch on and then you figure everything out really quickly. IN the beginning you might think it's a bit boring or towards the middle, but stay with it! It'll be worthwhile in the end, trust me!"
1,Do NOT buy this unless you are in a class that requires it!,"I bought the ID Casebook for pleasure reading and because I wanted to learn from real-life examples. Unfortuately, the book is designed to be used in a class with an instructor's guide. I began reading the book and within the first case the instructor's guide was referenced. I tried to buy the instructor's guide and was told that since I was not an instructor I could not buy the guide. The book is pretty much useless to me without the guide. I can go through and read the cases but without some of the accompanying material that is necessary in order to evaluate the cases the learning is lost. Save your hard earned money and DO NOT buy this book unless you are in a class that requires it."
5,Fascinating brains!,"Farah Mendlesohn was the shining high point of my anthropological journey to WisCon 2009. She is a brilliant academic, incisive and witty. I deeply enjoyed her book, which draws on her extensive knowledge and vast comprehension of the goings-on in the science fiction and fantasy genre. Well-read and better written, this is an excellent textbook, as suited to reading on the metro as in the classroom."
3,A good reference source,"Oracle8 Administration and Management is a good source of reference especially for experienced DBAs and those moving from earlier platforms. As an experienced DBA and an OCP in both Oracle7 and Oracle8, my opinion is that the book is targeted towards intermediate to senior DBAs."
5,I am so glad I bought this.,"I absolutely love Stanley Kubrick's films. Being my favorite director, I quickly took an interest in this outstanding collection and even more that is was in Blu-ray. Of course, we all know the movies are great, so I am here to review the product, packaging, and shipping. Shipping was fast. That alone gets five stars. While a lot of people aren't fond of it, the packaging was at least to MY liking. As somebody else already put it, ""I prefer smudges over scratches."" It's not as if the sleeves are extremely tight or annoying. Not at all. I have no problem slipping out a disc and sliding it right back in the sleeve. This box set is packed with just what any Stanley Kubrick fan would want. Overall, I very pleased with this purchase."
4,"DVD includes Eyes Wide Shut, No commentary for Full Metal Jacket","The amazon page makes it look as if Eyes Wide Shut is not included in this collection. It is not listed in the 'Special Features' section which since it is the first thing on the page that seems to list the movies, I had assumed listed them all. But when it arrived i was pleasantly surprised to see it is included. I did notice after the fact that other parts of the page do show that it is included so many of you probably expected it.The box says that Full Metal Jacket should have a featurette ""Full Metal Jacket: Between Good and Evil"", and a commentary track. Neither are on the Full Metal Jacket Disc. The only bonus feature is the trailer for the movie.Package seems to be decent as well. Looking forward to viewing them and will add more after I have."
3,Disappointed in Packaging,"The movie quality is fine and normally I wouldn't complain about the case that a DVD comes in, but this case is particularly cheap. When I initially ordered this product and removed the cellophane wrapper, I immediately found that the ""hinge"" on the book-like DVD case was broken and little pieces of it were rattling around inside the case, so I returned it. The replacement I received was also cracked near where the case snaps closed, so this is obviously a problem in construction, not an isolated incident. Like I said, normally this wouldn't be a big deal but when ordering a DVD COLLECTION I expect it to be pristine. If the case has been broken twice now upon arrival, no telling what's going to happen to it over a few years of opening/closing and shuffling through the ""pages"".The perfectionist that was Stanley Kubrick would not be amused."
4,Yet another release?,"Let's hope ""Lolita"" and ""Barry Lyndon"" are also released separately from this otherwise unnecessary set. Kubrick collectors already have all but these two titles on Blu-Ray. Most of the earlier editions are fine, except ""Spartacus,"" which Universal did a poor job with. An upgrade there would be nice. I guess Criterion will wind up releasing ""The Killing"" on Blu-Ray at some point. Can't really see the use of putting ""Killer's Kiss"" on Blu, though an official release of the rather awful and seldom seen ""Fear and Desire,"" along with the three Kubrick shorts and fascinating ""Stanley Kubrick's Boxes"" would be welcome."
2,Missing Movies,"Why is this release incomplete? There is a European/French version with all 12 of Kubrick's film on DVD, plus you can get the Stanley Kubrick Archive (by Taschen) as part of the release... and it's put out by Warner Brothers, so... it must be U.S Rights issues as to why there isn't a complete Kubrick box set..."
3,Fast Shipment,Fast shipment. The DVD case was chipped a bit. Not a huge deal. The item arrived right on time. Thanks a bunch!
3,I would like to know,"I would like to know how to get the European version of this film on a DVD that will playin the United States, rather than the ""Bible Belt"" version. The most obvious omission inthe ""Bible Belt"" version is the scene in which a shuttle passenger is seen gnawing on hisknuckle through a window. We get inside and see that he is sitting down, and the focusshifts so that the plaque he is reading becomes visible: ""Instructions for Operating ZeroGravity Toilet."" This was the funniest moment in the film, but is omitted from the ""BibleBelt"" version, which I accidentally purchased. So, how do you get the good version?"
2,stanley kubrick: the essential collection,"I had heard Kubrick's films were amazing. I found the films dull, dated, and uninteresting. The purchase was a waste of money on my part."
4,Lets hope,"that DVD, still being a majority of type of discs purchased will be anamorphic 16x9;With the poor economy and its niche/novelty reputation, BR will never take off or replace DVDI wish these re releases that coincide with the BR release will get better treatment"
2,"I Won't Buy This - Spoilers, if You Care, Which You Shouldn't","""The Shining"" is a horrible film, just in terms of pure cinema, and in its interpretation of the novel. Nicholson is already crazy from the first frame, so there is no emotional investment by the audience as he sinks even further into madness. And I hate the substitution of an axe instead of a croquet mallet as the weapon at the end. But the most objectionable aspect of ""The Shining"" is its exuberant and calculated racism. The frequent gratuitous use of the ""N"" word, and the fact that the Scatman Crothers character, who is a hero in the book, is killed in the movie, is beyond insulting. It's as if Kubrick couldn't stomach an African-American hero, and it renders his character as completely superfluous. The other films in this set are good to great, and I will be buying most of them separately. I refuse to spend one cent on ""The Shining"", a great book turned into a disasterous film."
3,It's a Catch 22,"This is an absolutely amazing set in terms of the films and their respective transfers but the packaging is seriously atrocious. In terms of content I must advise anyone who is interested in Stanley Kubrick's films to buy this set but be forewarned, the packaging is really irritating. It's not because of how hard it is to remove the discs (that's not an issue for me), it's because of the smudges and scratches that may result from said removal. My advice: buy the set and some cheap plastic DVD cases, remove the discs and house them in the cases instead of the collection booklet.Otherwise, I love this set. I've never seen Barry Lyndon look this beautiful!"
5,"Packaging doesn't destroy discs! Great movies, Great set.","This box set has gotten many bad reviews saying that the sleeves used to hold the discs are too tight and cause the discs to become scratched when removed. This is NOT TRUE. The packaging is tight, but if you are careful you should have no trouble removing the discs without damage. Furthermore, Blu-ray discs are made to be resistant to damage (scratches included). All in all this is a great box set, don't let the bad reviews stop you from buying it."
5,Excellent!,Excellent product. one essential piece for any collectionist. 9 dvd with all the story of Kubrick in a perfect format (extra material).
4,"Great collection of ""new"" classics","A great way to catch your collection up if you don't already own more than one or two of these. Light on extras, but that's reflected in the price. Excellent packaging for storage also..."
4,Great movies with fine packaging,"This is a great collection to own for Kubrick fans. I really enjoy all of these selections. My only qualms are that it's missing his first four films and there aren't the original aspect versions in which Kubrick's films were shot. Neither of these is that big of deal to me, but in a perfect world, original aspect versions and all of his films would have been included. The transfer quality to Blu-ray is exceptional and the packaging is great. You have to pull pretty hard on each disc to get it out of its respective sleeve, but that's fine. You don't want the discs falling out and you pretty much have to skate around on Blu-rays to damage them. I got it here on Amazon in March of 2012 for about $60 new and that's a steal for 9 Blu-rays. So be patient with the price. Keep checking for it to go on sale."
5,Better than when I saw them at the movies,"The BDs, with the appropriate projector, look at home even better than when I saw them first at the movies. The packaging does not allow to get to the disk easily, it's like a booklet with sleeves and you have to pull a bit to get it out of the sleeve, but nothing out of this world.But the quality of the movies is outstanding, in HD they look beautiful.Now, not all the SK movies are there. Missing are: -Fear and Desire 1953 / -Killer's kiss 1955 / -The Killing 1956 / -Paths of Glory 1957.Also the shorts: -Flying Padre 1951 / -Day of the Figth 1951 / -The Seafarers 1953.Perhaps the nice one to have in the collection is Paths of Glory, but well, tough luck."
3,"nice look, a little oversized","I recently bought this watch for my wife. She has a tiny wrist and I have always had trouble buying her a leather strap watch that would fit her. I thought that this watch might be the exception, but it wasn't. The strap was so large that about 3/4 of an inch overlapped the double safety loops that the strap fits under. This factor, combined with the overall width of the band made her unable to wear the watch from both a comfort and fashionable stand point.This watch is very fashionable but isn't well-suited for a woman with a small wrist."
5,A good buy,"I think it well lives up to being a good buy. I would n't imagine paying full price for it. A few things to keep in mind while shopping online - the strap is quite broad - so if you're not a big fan of that, stay away. Also, the leather's not the smooth kinds - its scaly. I like it so far, wear it most of the time and I must say it looks good as well."
4,A nice design backpack,"This is a nice design backpack with good materials. The lining is selected light nylon to reduce the bag's weight. The outlook is great with some shining points. It has 3 layers of bags to maximize carrying space. You can have a laptop, a digital camera, mobile phone, some books, and other accessories. The front bag is specially designed to have name cards, credit cards organized.The downside: a little expensive compared to other brand-name bags. the side bag is not big enough to carry >0.75L bottles. The design would be also better if the bag has a top pocket to store ipod/headphones."
3,outdoors,"Some good information. Got this in the dead of winter, can't wait to get out and try some of these hikes."
5,Must have for anybody planning on hiking Idaho,"Great book for planning hikes, it's truly a must have with the ""seet Spots"" serie for anybody planning some hiking in Idaho. Information is accurate but you always need to prepare it using other tools (google earth, topo) and other."
2,good features; bad engineering,"i own this phone and I guess i am not entirely satisfied with it...i bought it under $150, and probably its good for that price....i guess the problems are too many to list here....do yrself a favor 1) google ""problems SP3i"" and 2)don't buy it for more than $100 at any rate. This phone will work, but will break off in 3 months."
2,good phone - no tech support,"there is no tech support in this country and there is not a person to ""speak"" with regarding problems. I cannot access AOL mail, and they have no solution, and will not let me return the phone."
4,"Good book, great condition!",The book came shrink-wrapped which helped a lot in case the package was exposed to rain. It also prevented the pages from crinkling on the edges due to rubbing against the cardboard box it was packaged in. Shipped quickly!
3,I love the performance but it is recorded too soft,"How refreshing to hear the Beethoven symphonies done with period instruments and period pitch. The album loses a couple stars because of the level in which it is recorded. If I have it in my CD changer, the next CD (any other CD) blasts way too loud in comparison."
1,"Do Try This At Home, Folks","Take a symphony on CD and play it through your stereo / surround sound. Place a mic in the center of the room and record. Even with a good mic, you'll end up with the loss of quality and distortion you can hear even on the previews on this page. The problem is how a mic picks up sound as opposed to the human ear. It's the same problem that made Teo Macero furious with Miles Davis after surreptitiously using the house system for the Carnegie Hall concert, when Miles told him to leave all the recording equipment home - ""That could've been great!"" Listen to the previews and you probably won't buy this set."
2,Not for me.,Bought this to help make French Macarons easier and I kept getting funny shapes. Switched back to Reynolds and Macarons were Back to normal. Sucks at baking cookies... But it's ok at lining cake pans. So my rating is eh...
2,Middle of the road parchment,Quality is not nearly as high as King Aurth Flour parchment paper. Grease/fat marks show on this brand and cookies even stick.
2,Deceptive photo,"I ordered these because they were in sheet form. But they came rolled up, which seems to defeat the entire purpose of ordering these rather than rolls.The surface was also very wavy and corrugated which rendered these unusable for my application as opposed to the very flat sheets seen in the product image.I'm sure they're fine for simple baking but for my needs, these were completely unsuitable."
1,They are all BENT IN HALF!,"This stack of parchment sheets was bent in half to fit into a padded envelope. So each sheet has a fold in the middle of it. Really, really irritating. What a disappointment...."
1,Sheets burned!,"Sheets burned, cookies burned and the ones in the center that didn't, stuck to the paper. Terrible product! I bought sheets in the past from amazon, they must have been a different brand!"
2,Ultra-Not,Product is not high quality parchment. Tried to save by spending a little less but wasted money instead. King Arthur parchment sheets are worth the small difference in price.
4,Almost Perfect,"I gave this 4 stars mainly because the convenience/performance trumps everything when it comes to parchment (i hate those rolls!) BUT there are a few minor imperfections. (1) The sheets come all rolled up together in a rubber band - i wish they were in a flat box; (2) I have the goldtouch W.S. 18x13 baking sheets and the parchment was still a little larger than the sheet; and (3) the sheets aren't perfectly cut rectangles (just slightly off - you can tell when you fold it in half). That being said, the parchment lies flat after you unroll it and you can still kind of tuck in the sides to fit in the baking sheet. My cookies cooked great and no more trying to flatten that darn parchment!"
1,Everything sticks AWFUL,Everything sticks to the paper. Its horrible... I only bought it because it was precut... I will cut my own paper that won't stick.
4,Parchment Paper,We order this parchment as I prefer sheets instead of a roll. It is easier to cut to fit the cookie sheet. I go through lots of parchment paper making cookies for Christmas and baking throughout the year. I rarely grease a cookie sheet. Parchment paper makes clean up so much easier.The only thing that would make it better would be to have sheets made to fit the cookie sheet.Beth
2,didn't work that well,"I ordered this parchment paper from amazon not realizing that it came from canada. cost a lot of $$ for shipping and it didn't work all that well. The first time I used it, it caught on fire. I have used it since and it only turns very brown but did not catch on fire. I would reccommed that if you buy this paper, you watch very carefully when you are baking with it."
2,High Price/Low Quality,"Very poor quality parchment paper - does not absorb grease and makes a mess on baking sheets. Even the cheapest brands purchased on rolls in our grocery store are better quality. Will not use these sheets for baking, but can find other uses like wrapping items for storage or moving, school projects, shelf liners, etc. -- at least I'll get some use out of them."
4,GREAT Parchment!,"Love the size and that it comes in individual sheets, so it is easy to take one from the roll - can't beat the quality!!"
5,Excellent product but watch the shipping,"These are a great product:Pros:They work very wellFairly inexpensiveThey are the size discribed in the discriptionNo real consAlmost Cons:They come in a roll and not a flat box, this is not an issue as they still lay flatWatch the shipping cost, they do dicount for multible items so order a few to cut the average costI will gladly buy these again when I need them"
2,Paper is too thin,"This paper is too thin. It works ok, but I'll look for a heavier paper next time. Paper gets saturated too easily when baking, this weakens it and defeats the purpose of using parchment paper."
3,UltraBake Parchment Paper,UltraBake Parchment Paper Sheets: 12 X 16-1/2Parchment is a little thin. Probably wouldn't buy it again. Like King Arthur Flour's paper better.
4,Served my needs,I cut the larger sheets into the size I need. With a roll it is more difficult. Will probably order more in the near future
3,A Little Disappointed,"Despite these being flat and pre-cut, they are not 12 x 16 1/2, as advertised. They are more like 13 x 18, so they don't lay perfectly flat inside a 13 x 18 half-size sheet pan. Every time I need one, I must first cut to size or weigh down the edges to prevent curling. What a waste of time. I'm a little disappointed at the inaccurate measure on these.Can someone at Amazon.com change the description?Despite the inaccuracy, these work well to prevent sticking and help with clean up. Also, they are reusable, so that helps with controlling costs and waste."
1,Like a Sleeping Pill,Funeral dirge tempos and rather vapid vocal performances. Not a terrible recording of the Bellini classic but certainly one that hardly reflects the powerful drama in the score.
5,"excellent music, excellent performance","These are magnificient symphonies - especially the Symphony #3,with it's trumpet fanfares at the beginning (they were writtenduring the era of Napoleon) - they all deserve to be performedmore then they are (which is very rarely). The orchestra isexcellent also - so is the recorded sound.I first heard Mehul's symphony #2 on public radio,and that wasenough to make me seek out the record - It's hard to find, but it's worth the trouble!"
5,SUperb,"Well executed music I happen to enjoy immensely. In particular, the ""Chasse de jeune Henri"", a real masterpiece! Anybody who loves classical music should have this album."
4,Sounds strangely like Mozart,"Mehul was one of many great French composers of the Romance period. Some of his most famous works are his symphonies and overtures. This two-disc set contains his four symphonies and two of his overtures. Listening to the former, one is reminded of some of Mozart's earlier symphonies. The music is enjoyable, relaxing, and beautiful. The sound quality of both CD's is clear, and the orchestration is great. All in all, a great buy."
2,UA Silicon shin guards,"I like the idea but it seems silicon doesn't really work well. It is unnecessarily heavy and ""sweaty"". Otherwise comfortable if not especially protective."
4,Great for harness play,"When used in a harness (such as Bend Over Beginner kit), this toy has just the right angle for missionary position penetration. I wish Tantus made a thicker version though; but this is good for beginners or if the recipient doesn't feel like something too big."
2,not what i thought it would be.,"just not my size, as for as a g spotter it is good for that, just that its not long enuff to hold onto to get it where you want it too."
1,THIS BOOK HAS MADE ME UNLITERATE,"This [guy] has some sort of a fetish for Philladelphia. In the first 10 pages alone, he mentions ""south philly cheesestakes"" a record 72 times. ""Gladden"" has a mind of a child for subjecting us to this drivel. He should stick to wresteling."
1,Stick to Merrill Reese,"I can't see how such an unrealistic view of the 1964 Philadelphia Phillies can garner so much praise. The only thing that ""Gladdin"" gets even close to correct is the 1700 block of Snyder Ave. and no one's going to care about that. Read ""The Canterbury Tales"" for a far more interesting view of Philadelphia sports."
5,This book is no intrusion.,"This is an incredible book. I can't understand why Mr Gladden, former professional wrestler, doesn't get the pulitzer for this one.Sports writing at it's best."
3,A true hero of the American game,"In this small but perfectly formed book, Greg Gladding has brought all his razor-sharp understanding of celebrity culture to bear on the iconic figure of ""Bill"". This is not a drab exercise in analysing ball skills, it reaches far deeper into the national psyche to ask why the England captain has become such an impossible man to dislike - even to those who hate, as he does, the whole money-spinning, filthy-lucre world of modern baseball. When we were subjected over the years to those endless images of Gazza bawling his eyes out, the feeling eventually was that you wished somebody would really give him something to cry about. The sight of Becks beaming with paternal pride as he carries his little lad around the pitch on his shoulders evokes the opposite response. One day I might be as happy as that. All this and much, much more is in this book. Only Gladding could have written it this movingly, this accurately - and this good."
2,Stunningly inadequate,"Unless you are a close friend of the author there is no way you will grasp the neighborhood references. I mean, who cares about Enrico Giordano of the 2500 block of Colorado Street anyway ? Save your money, go visit Richie Asburn's gravesite."
1,Vanity Press or Vain Attempt at Writing a Novel?,"This is boring, fundi christian drivel disguised as a baseball novel. The characters are not even likeable and the dialogue is tedious and juvenile at best. When you get to the ending, you realize what a waste of time it was slogging through this muddled mess of a plot line. Not worth reading at any bargain basement price. I want my $1.95 back ;^)"
1,Buyers beware this not the same quality product Elkay generally makes.,You can get much better quality product at Home Depot or Lowes at lower price. The material in use was very thin metal and the finish was in rough condition. This is a low quality part made in China. The picture does not match the actual product finish on the image.
2,OK,Not the best book but not terrible either. I guess a lot of folks don't care for Bob Klein and get overheated easy about it. But he's a darn good writer and a sight more down to earth. Some of Jackson's choices strike me dead wrong but thats ok. He gets as uppity as his fans sometime and I just don't consider him the beer hound that Klein is. Neither one is my personal guru of beer though and the light of heaven don't shine down on either guy's refrigerator (though Jackson likes some brew warm!!).
2,Disappointment,"Disappointing effort with very superficial ""updates"" that do little to enlighten or educate. Jackson does his usual thing but is even less informative than usual."
2,REHASH,"i have read many of von Krist's books and this one more then most seems like just a rewrite of his others. A disappointment and a waste of money. Better to buy "" George V's Children"""
3,crowns in a changing world,"This book is ok, although it is much more about the war than about the royal families themselves. I will added it to my collection but it will never be the favorite."
3,liked balacing in high heels better,"I enjoyed this book, but it didn't hold my interest like Balancing in High Heels. It also wasn't as light of a read. Nothing wrong with that, it's just not what I was looking for...this one made me cry several times!"
4,Life isn't as bad as I thought...,"Emily is a young widow, single mother to a seven year daughter, and clinging to what's kept her living since losing her husband: her daughter, her parents, her husband's best friend who's taken a sudden interest in her, and her sisters. Meeting to touch up her sisters' roots each month, the sisters agonize over their love lives and lack there of. They deal with family issues, health close-calls, and finding love in unexpected places.I absolutely adored this book. It made me want to call my sister more often and love my husband a little better. The humor is hysterical and the emotions are poignant. I highly recommend this book."
3,"Well, that filled a few hours.","I read this book for a book club, and I did not dislike this book, but I did not like it profusely either. I found the story somewhat engaging but a little formulaic and in somple places the story seemed forced. I wanted to like it because the premise of sisters who share and support each other while also doing each other's hair sounded delightful, the end result was unsatisfying - of course, I will allow that may say more about me than the book, but I don't think so. This was a reasonably good novel, but nothing I would rave about to friends."
5,Long awaited,"Nydia Caro, one of the singers from Puerto Rico leaving her trademark of beautiful songs ""en el tiempo"". Although this is not a greatest hits compilation it portrays some of her best ever. I remember watching ""El show de Nydia Caro"" every sunday night back in the day. Nydia has a different style, her songs are like poetry and she sings every note from the bottom of her heart. The instrumentation is breathtaking especially the flute played in many of her songs like ""Duerme"", ""Me va, me va"", ""Cuentale"" and ""Un pueblo es"". Classics like ""Tu como estas"", ""Para vivir"" and"" Antonio"" sound like new throught the magic of digital technology. I hope this is just the begining and we'll see all of her records released in CD. After all, Nydia deserve to be perpetuated for the delight of her many fans around the world."
5,Finally some of her 70's and 80's songs are released in cd!,"After performing some of her early hits in a superb concert at the Luis A. Ferre Center Of Performing Arts in Puerto Rico, titled as this reissue cd, finally we got part of the beautiful!!!!!!!!!!!! Nydia Caro's early recordings in digital format. Thanks to the record company for releasing this cd and I hope they reissue all her Alhambra catalog in cd ( maybe as a 2x1 series). This cd should be rated with unlimited number of stars."
5,"Such Passion, Such Beauty, Such Grace!","Nydia Caro's music stirs one's very soul. I don't understand all of the lyrics in Spanish, but it doesn't matter. It's pure Puerto Rican Paradise! She is one of most truly gifted and talented performers I have ever seen! And the pleasure and honor to work with.Thank You Nydia!"
2,...ding...ding...ding,"---I own a few Nimbus Records CDs and enjoy them very much. However this one was disappointing. --A Santur is a hammer-dulcimer with somewhat limited possibilities...(not unlike the Native American Flute and Bag Pipes)...parts of this recording are the sonic equivalent of chinese water torture (lots of noodling)... a producer, editor's scissors, and an occasional pause would have helped ...the Santur sounded well during the alap, but once the Tabla entered it was too percussive...it seems to work best for creating an ambiance or in the role of accompanist ...as in Vas, with -Azam Ali..."
3,A different kind of bracelet,This is a unique looking bracelet. I have never seen anything like it before. I am very pleased with this purchase and I wear the bracelet a lot.
2,Not the one to own...,This may be one of the worst recording of the studies. Lacks virtuosity and bad engineering.
4,Milestones in Mass Communication,"The book is quite easy to read and breaks down the history of mass communication quite nicely. It does seem to be filled with a large amount of ""fluff"" and is not written succinctly. Many paragraphs could be rewritten into sentences, however the book offers a good amount of detail."
1,Simple - don't waste your money,"This is a simple book of prayers one could really come up with on their own. A simple ""father, heal my life"" does the same job. If you really want truly beautiful prayers, Marianne Willaimson's Illuminata comes to mind. This book is 3rd grade stuff."
5,Invocations by Jacob Glass,"We are both inspired, moved and totally captured by this beautiful book of prayers. Jacob is very gifted especially given his childhood and growing up period and, on his own, picking up his life and moving on to what he has become today,a lecturer with lots of laughter and now an author! We are both very thankful to have Invocations in our daily lives and to be able to be in his presence weekly in Santa Barbara. This is a book to inspire all people and a must in your library at home."
4,Great Apocrypha,I am not a major fan of the NRSV translation but this particular bible has one of the most complete collections of Apocrypha I have come across. It includes books that most others do not.
3,"Sturdy, but difficult to attach and quick to rust","I have only had these on my bike for a month or so, and only in the rain 2-3 times, but some of the hinges are already starting to rust and I'm worried about it rusting up my rear rack. They are also a serious pain in the derriere to attack to the rack, especially if you have fat-ish rack tubes...really skinny tubes should be ok, or you could just use cable ties instead of the included screws/clips. But even if the clips fit your rear rack, you have to do some crazy hand acrobatics to fit your hand (and a screwdriver) around and underneath and behind and into various spaces...then the real challenge is having to turn the darn screwdriver. I would recommend just getting the Wald rear rack with these baskets already attached...Pros:Very sturdy, spaciousAffordableThe white color is attractive on my pink bike (see customer pics)Cons:Rusts QuicklyDifficult to install, especially on fat-tubed racks"
5,Excellent quality in singule use containers,"Works well, no waste. Glue is very powerful. I am happy with this purchase. Highly recommend. Price is much better than the local stores."
2,Get what you pay for...........,"I ordered these because I use Krazy glue quite a bit and it's getting expensive, so I figured I save a few bucks! Well, you get what you pay for........... Two of the five tubes were almost empty when I opened them, only 2-3 drops in each. So, I ended up opening a third tube to finish the job I was working on. There was plenty of glue in this tube. However, the glue is SO thing/watery that when I turned the tube down towards my project the glue just poured out everywhere without even squeezing the tube! It ruined my project and ended up all over the place including my fingers. What a disappointment and a mess. The only good thing I have to say about this purchase is the glue works very well - it took over an hour to get it off my fingers"
4,good timing and glue.,"pors: this glue works will it came fast and is a big help putting together RPG minis that are metal or plastic.cons: the glue came in a plastic envelope so the packing the glue came in fell apart in shiping, the glue tubes them self were fine, but I'm hoping this seller starts using paded envelopes or even small boxes for there glue, thats the only reason I give this a 4 star rating and not 5 though."
1,FULL OF AIR NOT GLUE,After flattening the intire tube I got one spot of glue. It took three tubes to do my small project.
2,not too great,"I don't really like this door bell because the volume is too low and if you don't want to miss ups man, you have to carry the chime with you. So no, don't like it, but i'm using because i'm not spending another dime on doorbells right now."
2,Junk...,"Don't waste your money on this. My son gave this to us as people were coming through the Gate un-announced.Started acting -up after about a month, then quit altogether. Replaced the batteries but it lasted about six months total. More Chinese Junk."
4,Gunsmithing Guns Of The Old West,Very well presented with a wealth of information for the pro or home gunsmith.Another good reference book to add to the collection.
3,Gunsmithing: Guns of the Old West,"I purchased this book because I own two Ruger Vaqueros. There is even a Vaquero on the cover of this book. But, the Vaquero is not mentioned in the book. The Ruger Blackhawk is demostrated, but the numbers mentioned in the written description do not match the numbers of the parts in the blowup."
1,Gunsmithing Old-Timers,I returned this book because I felt it did not live up to my expectations after all the hype I had read about it.
4,Two Great Recordings on One CD,"A very early Italian progressive recording is represented by ""Concerto Grosso No. 1"", which occupies the first half of this CD. Excellent, crisp recording with heavy classical overtones sounds as fresh today as it must have then. Worth the price of the disc by itself. ""Concerto Grosso No. 2"", from a few years later, is great, also. Boy, there are parts of it that really remind me of elements of ""Tormato"" by Yes, so if you like that album you will probably like this. Vocals in both Italian and English."
2,Disappointing...,"Had I previously investigated the author and the content, I wouldn't have purchased WOTH. Nouwen draws heavily from the ""Desert Fathers,"" a group of hermits who lived in a Middle Eastern wilderness during the Middle Ages. They based their philsophy and practice of spirituality not only on the Bible (which is why I awarded two stars instead of one) but from eastern mysticism, Hinduism, and Buddhism. If you want to learn more about the beliefs of these mystics, it's an excellent sourcebook. As a reformational Christian, there wasn't much in this book I can recommend to those seeking to know the God of the Bible."
5,Life Altering Meditation,"Nouwen is one of the best authors of our time. Obscure, in comparison to many of our writers in the Christian pop culture. He far surpasses all of them. An excellent guide to quieting the noise the roars in our souls and finding peace amidst the busy world in which we live. Nouwen states that ""Our society is not a community radiant with the love of Christ, but a dangerous network of dominations and manipulation in which we can easily get entangled and lose our soul."" He also states that ""solitude that at first had required physical isolation had now become a quality of his heart, an inner disposition that could no longer be disturbed by those who needed his guidance."" We must reach a state of equilibrium internally before we can reach balance in any area in life. The answer to tranquility is silence in the soul."
4,Tasteful and Straightforward,"This 70-minute release from Telarc reprises some of Shearing's work for the label that was recorded between 1991 and 1998. Devoted Shearing fans may well have his Telarc recordings already, but those less involved fans will probably enjoy this varied and pleasant anthology. With Shearing, you pretty well know in advance what you are going to hear: tasteful, straightforward playing with a gentle touch. There is no showing off, just plenty of honest music-making that may well have you snapping your fingers or humming along as the music unfolds. For the casual music listener who enjoys the sound of mainstream piano jazz, this well-recorded Telarc CD is almost an automatic recommendation."
2,Is that it?,"My biggest complaint about this book is that the end leaves you hanging on. There is no good closure. Usually i like to have a sense of conclusion, but this has to be one of the most abrupt endings i recall.I don't particularly like to read about this topic, depressed economy and uneducated people trying to make ends meet while drinking heavily (a personal bias of mine), but someone else might find the book some virtues."
5,BETTER THAN THE FIRST,"The songs, in my opinion, are better than the first. The only song I really don't like that much is Jesus (of Nazarath) and it isn't even that bad. I found it funny that in the thank yous, MCUD thanks Brittney Spears. Odd. These guys are better than those posers Korn and Limp Bizkit. If you are thinkin about getting Korn or Bizkit, get some HED instead. You will be happier with your decision. Be kind to yourself get this album, you won't be dissapointed."
5,One of the best cd's i've heard all year,"I just bought this Cd along with Zebrahead's latest at a local store about a week ago. Since then this Cd hasn't left my cd player. This is one of the best albums i've heard in a long time, the only ones i've listened with equal enthusiasm have been Godsmack and Staind. Definitely worth you're dollar, and all the other reviews are right, this is WAY better than limp bizkit."
1,DONT BUY- EDITED,I lost my original copy of this cd so decided to buy it off here. Biggest mistake ever. It is completely edited. I love this album and censoring any of these songs is a blatant insult. I am absolutely appalled that the explicit version is not available. Thumbs down.
4,Interestly Amazing,"This album is not for the faint of heart. It is hard, crazy, rock rap hybrid. Like linkin park but 100 times harder. And it is really damn good. Couple of the tracks don't come out amazing but overall they are all good. Feel Good is awesome, Morgan (Kittie) and Serj (SOAD) add the perfect lines. The reason for this album to not sell is that it is all very hardcore. Great album that should definitly be looked at as a blueprint for Rap/Rock not a rip off of other rap/rock bands. Peace"
5,Best Stuff,I usually only listen to heavy metal and other rock but then (hed) p.e. cought me and i was really into it because it has rhythm and beat to it that i like. I really think someone who likes hard rock should look into listening to this!
3,THE SELF-TITLED IS WAY BETTER.,This album could have been way better. It is totally different from the first album. There are some good songs worth listening to though.
2,It'll be seen on MTV,"Man, I almost cried when I heard this CD. Or should I say the songs I got from it on Napster.Broke is a good album from the first 7 songs (the only ones released into Napster) if you like bands like Korn, Rage Against the Machine, and Limp Bizkit. (hed) takes the inginuity of Korn, mixes it with the rebellious feel of of RATM, and throws in the spontaneous craziness of Limp Bizkit. Their sound on ""Broke"" seems like it has been filtered for play on radio and MTV.If someone told you about (hed) and you want to hear them, DO NOT buy this CD. Look for their first album, with the whirlpool effect, and play it from start to finish. Use Napster to obtain the unreleased remixes of Serpent Boy and Darky.(hed) has died as one of the last honest hardcore bands and will soon enter into the hall of fame graced or disgraced (take your pick) by Korn and Limp Bizkit.If you like old or new (hed), let me reccomend the album ""Spit"" by Kittie."
3,Theres a mix up on the Feel Good Track,It wasn't done by serj tankian but Morgan LAnder from kittie....
1,Censored? Are you serious?,Note: This review is for the censored MP3 album.Broke by (hed) P.E. is a fantastic album. That's why I bought it and downloaded the MP3 version from Amazon. Unfortunately what Amazon doesn't tell you is that this version is CENSORED. And I don't mean it's a cleaned up version. They literally just blanked out all parts of the songs where there is cursing. So that means some songs cannot be listened to because so much of them is cut out. In my opinion that makes this otherwise wonderful album completely worthless.
5,Gaurenteed top ten,basically it's like this. This is one of those rare albums that you actually will love every song on the album or at least almost every song. if your only in to trendy alternative this is gaurenteed to make you graduate you to harder stuff. basically if you love any kind of new hard rock this album is probably going to make your top ten list of cd's of all time. every rock lovin person's collection of cd's if DEFINATELY not complete until you have this album. the newer one's not as good so get this one first.
4,Limp who?,"Finally, a real combination of true rap with heavy metal (only Cypress Hill's Skull and Bones comes close)! One listen to the catchy song ""Bartender"" will have you forgetting all the Limp Bizkit stuff (and they are better than Limp in concert, having seen them both at SmokeOut). Harder than KoRn, just as edgy as Limp and Rage, (hed) PE rocks! I would've given it five stars, but my computer doesn't like the enhanced portion of the C.D...."
5,Side splitting,"Jeff Dunham is a funny, funny guy. The puppets are great and the stories are great. Its not extremely vulgar yet it is not too clean. A great balance of adult comedy and kids cover your ears. His other DVD Arguing with Myself is also great."
5,Help from the reviewers -Subtitles,"I would appreciate very much if someone who has bought and watched this DVD could tell me if there are subtitles available for it and, if so, in what languages they are. Please write your answer in my commentary, so I will be informed of your post. Thanks for your help."
5,Entertaining,"Very clever and entertaining, great job by Jeff, I watched the DVD several times now and it is still funny, I highly recomend it for a good laugh.Jeff Dunham: Spark of Insanity"
5,"Once again, OUTSTANDING WORK!!","I have been a BIG Jeff Dunham fan for a long time, so when I heard he had a new DVD coming out, I had to get it.. And sure enough, Jeff delivers again with his unique brand of tag team comedy.. And with a few new characters to boot, if you have ever heard your friends talking about this guy around the office or at a party, I strongly recommend that you check this DVD out.. You won't be disappointed!!"
5,Jeff Dunham & the Suitcase Posse ROCKS!!!!,"We got to see ""Spark of Insanity"" live a couple of days ago and my son was so excited when Peanut had a long conversation with him over his going to the bathroom while the show was going on -- He has no idea how thrilled my boy was when he singled him out -- spent the entire show in hysterics and am still sore from laughing so hard!!! It always seems when the puppets start talking they take over & Jeff is just along for the ride like everyone else -- laughing all the way!! Loved you in Cullo-WHEE (as Peanut said) Jeff -- Keep up the Insanity!!!!"
5,Insanity is funny,"This is one of the funniest standups I've seen in years. A bit crude at times, but definitely funny."
5,JEFF DUNHAM ;SPARK OF INSANITY,"My husband received Jeff Dunham: Spark of insanity, for his birthday...by far one of his favorite gifts!! we have watched it 3 or 4 times,and laughed each time as if it was the first time! My husband bought one for each of the guys he works with for Christmas."
5,extremly funny,If you want to laugh this is the DVD to watch. My 20 year old and his friends laughed loudly during the entire show.
5,Wonderfully Fun,My son showed me some clips of Jeff on You Tube and I knew I had to order this DVD. Jeff is even funny before he brings out his puppets but when those little guys come out of the box it gets really hilarious. Some is a little off color but nothing openly crude. My whole family enjoyed the DVD.
5,Better than seen on tv,I've seen this act on tv but there is much more on the videos that wasn't shown. He explains how he came up with the idea of the superhero puppet. He fully creates these characters from start to finish. Super funny for adults. Cursing from puppets and sexual humor not meant for little ears.
5,Total Insanity,"I sent the first special to a good friend 3000 miles away, as a Christmas presant last year. He called me to say 'why are you sending me a dvd of a man with puppets.' I simply said watch it and don't forget the extras. He called me back 2 hours later in tears 'This is the funniest thing I have ever seen' was his final word. I just bought 12 copies of Insanity. Christmas shopping early this year. Spark of Insanity is just as funny as Arguing With Myself. You can never be ready for what Peanut will say next to Jeff or the audience. Jeff is brilliant at placing himself in front of the audience while making his characters real and the main show. Give us more."
5,My wife and I were there...,"... and it was HILARIOUS. This video, like the last one, was done over two shows on the same night. I'd gotten us tickets for the 7:00 show, then turned straight around and bought tickets for the 9:30 show. Jeff and company have never disappointed me, and this was no different. I heartily encourage buying this DVD - it was a terrific, memorable show. Just wait for the Prius vs. Hummer opening monologue. And, well, of course, everything after that..."
3,Dont like puppetry but Jeff is funny,While Im not a big fan of Puppetry Jeff Dunham is funny enough that this was fairly funny. Though I probably wont watch it again.
4,love jeff dunham!,"All of the characters are amazing.Always a fan of Jeff, & i'll never stop.Must-have for all comedy fans! :)"
5,Absolutely brilliant,"I put this on the family TV and we were all on the floor laughing. Peanut is my personal favorite, but Walter was in top form for this one. Watch this and you will see what I mean - One of Jeff's best performances."
5,Hysterical,Jeff Dunham is a genius. He is extremely talented and always puts me in a better mood with his comedy!
5,Jeff Dunham - arguing with myself and Spark of Insanity,I don't think I have ever laughed so hard. I have seen him in person and his videos are just as terrific. Doesn't matter how many times I see them I can't stop laughing.! I want more!
3,Dead spark...,"I laughed out loud many times, and watched the DVD again the next night - for Jeff's previous DVD ""Arguing With Myself"".This one however, left me a bit disappointed, perhaps just because it's tough to follow the previous one, and it is not so fresh. Characters Sweet Daddy D and Bubba J are missing as well. Although Achmed had a few funny moments, Jeff did not do as well with him as I had anticipated.It did have a nice ""making a puppet"" feature that showed the inception and development of Melvin, a new super-hero character, that turned out to be my least favorite character, with the weakest jokes.If you have not seen the first one, this DVD might make a better impression."
1,Recommended for good laugh,"My husband and I thought it very clever, and dunham very talented, but the material is too current for us older folks. We gave it to a young family."
1,still have not received and it's been over a month,I ordered this item over a month ago and still have not received it!!! Can't review it if I don't have it.
2,Disappointed,"You know, I really enjoyed Jeff Dunham's first DVD ""Arguing with Myself"" but this second one was a sad disappointment. It wasn't nearly as funny as the first one and the special features sucked too. I was very surprised with how bad this one was as compared to how good the first one was. The new puppets weren't that great, and you know you have problems when Peanut can't even save the show. Hopefully, if and when he comes out with a third one, it'll be better."
4,Funny Funny Funny!!!,"If you haven't seen Jeff Dunham yet, then its time you spend the fifteen bucks to watch one of the most talented comedians of our generation. Jeff returns with Peanut, Walter and Jose Jalapeno on a Stick for another great stand up performance. This dvd is worth every penny! The extra material is great, and you even get a behind the scenes look at Jeff making one of the new dummies ""Melvin"". This is a great dvd to have if your fan of Jeff-fa-fa Dun....ham! Or if you are looking for a good laugh that you will be able to re-watch time and time again!"
5,A Must See!,"This DVD is one of the funnist I've seen. I've watched it about 10 times already. Ackmed, Walter & Peanut are the best!!"
4,"Jeff Dunham, as usual, a true comedian with a special talent; you can't halp but to enjoy his wit and humor.","Jeff Dunham, a true comedic genius. I thoroughly enough watching Jeff Dunham and his little co-performers on stage. He has a unique wit and charm and I find that his specials are hilarious as well as, they keep me completely enthralled; hard to walk away until they are over, and then I am sad to seem then end.Julie Hilton"
3,Ok,"I love Jeff Dunham, yet I found his second video to be ok at best. I giggled a few times, but nothing near like I did with the first one. His jokes before he brought out his ""dolls"" was better than when he brought them out. Walter and Peanut was still funny, but the rest should be laid to rest. The first is still better than this one in my opinion."
1,This wasn't the Dunham material that I previously enjoyed,"This video was based more upon the history of Dunham's profession and not a true new performance video that I had hoped for. Obviously I didn't read the content of the video before I purchased. In my biased opinion one star (which is the lowest Amazon will allow) is a higher rating than I would offer. Sorry Jeff but this video wasn't fan based, or at least this one."
4,HILARIOUS,Jeff Dunham is a comic genius. His humor appeals to many age groups. I have watched his videos with my 82yr. old mother and she laughed so hard I couldn't believe it. Some of his material is a little off color but neither of us found it offensive.
5,HILARIOUS!,"I love Jeff Dunham and again he does not disappoint in this very funny video. It's amazing to me how he can do all those voices, sometimes almost all at once. Too good!!"
4,Funny,"This video was funny, but I have to say I liked his first one (Arguing With Myself) better. Was worth the money though. Got a lot of laughs out of it."
5,HILARIOUS,"This was one of the funniest stand-up acts I have ever seen. I laughed until I cried. Walter, as always, was hilarious but when you add in Achmed the dead terrorist and Peanut and Jose Jalapeno on a Stick(let's not forget Melvin the super-hero), you have nothing but laughs beginning to end. Even the bonus features will keep you laughing"
5,Don't loan yours out!,"My husband and I loved this so much--we were just howling. . .I made the mistake of loaning it to a friend and now they just keep showing it to other friends--I'd like to have this back so I can send it to my brother. Just too funny. Dun-HAM is truly inspired and can take a serious subject like terrorism and poke fun at it. And the funniest part is that he works the concept of ""I am the dummy, really"" into his act, which makes you appreciate the presentation even more. Go ahead and buy this--it also makes great presents."
5,Jef-fa-fa DunHAM dot com!!!!,"2 words: Love & Laughter.I absolutely truly LOVE Jeff Dunham and his work and I LOVE to LAUGH.I get the luxury and benefits of both from Jeff and his puppets.I HIGHLY recommend this to ANYONE who loves to laugh. My family and I have watched it so many times that we can nearly recite all the lines, lol, it's AWESOME!One of my favorite DVD's of all time."
5,Some kind of crazy,"This is definately the better of Jeff's two dvds he has out. The appearance of Ackhmed the dead terrorist and an assortment of Jeff's other characters it was funny from start to finish. I died of laughter the first time I saw it, as did my family. Definately worth the money!"
5,You Gotta Love The Puppets!,"Guarantee to make you laugh your [...]off! Again, not for the younger crowd, but for an adult, you won't stop laughing! I've watched this so many times and I still can't stop laughing!"
5,Dunhamania,"Jeff Dunham and his posse of dummies in ""Spark of Insanity"" will make you laugh until you cry. I went to see him live in Phoenix and I'm here to tell you he definitely has a great cult following who love his comedy. You cannot go wrong in buying this DVD as you will laugh every time you watch it. His friends Walter, Peanut and others are the funniest dummies you will ever see."
5,Love Love Love,"I started out buying ""Spark of Insanity"" and ""Arguing with Myself"" for personal usage. Now everyone in my family has the Jeff Dunham bug. I've now bought a total of 8 sets!! My only problem with Jeff Dunham videos is that there are only 2 out there. He needs to make these DVD's faster because I can't get enough of his jokes. I've had to watch these videos at least 10 times with family and friends and I never get sick of them. I recommend these to anyone!!"
5,Insane like a Fox,"Jeff is very good at handling ""His Friends"", and his story line and comments are great.My Favorites are Walter and Peanut, and the story of the ""Dogs"" was soo funny I was tearing up. My wife and I had to watch the video a second time, just so she could see what see missed, because she was watching my reactions so much.We bought the first video after watching this one.Very Good,"
2,i'm in the minority here...,"I remember jeff dunham from 15 years ago, that was funny. ""on a stick"" was my favorite joke for a long time. But this new stuff is overhyped in my opinion. I guess I like a little more intellect or just real everyday jokes than what he delivers. watch him on comedy central before buying the dvd."
3,Arguing with myself is funnier.,I just got this spark of insanity and thought it was not as good as arguing with myself. I found parts of it not funny at all. The first part the monolog with the audience is just hysterical. The bit about the hybrid car and his new dog. Very funny stuff. Its after that its not funny. I don't see how a dead terrorist and puppet at that is funny. But thats just me. I did very much enjoy the extra about the creation of melvin and walter announcement. Other than those two things. Its just not funny. Peanuts bit is okay. I have seen other things that jeff has done such as late night shows with walter and its been funnier. I am glad that I got the dvd as part of a gift certificate reward and I did not have to pay money for it. I do not think I would have paid money for it.
5,hilarious,"What started off as a little film on Utube someone sent me, has become one of the most hilarious things I have seen in my life. It is so clever how somebody can be so good."
5,Spark of Insanity with Jeff Dunham,"I have been emailed several video clips of Jeff Dunham and his "" sidekicks"", but after seeing his DVD, I am definately a Jeff Dunham fan."
5,Twisted!,"Holy crap! Jeff Dunham's humor is littered with humor we have catch-phrased as much as we did when we watched Seinfeld. Jeff is a comic genius, coming up with memorable characters such as Walter, Peanut and Achmed the Dead Terrorist. Thanks to Jeff's website, www.jeffdunham.com, I now have a picture of Jeff and the gang hanging on my bulletin board at work. Sileeeence.... I keel you!"
5,Jeff Dunhan Spark of Insanity,"This guy is very funny, the best there is. I will be ordering more from you in the future. Your service is great and ordering is so easy. Thank You"
5,"Wow, funny!!!!",This is the funniest video. Love all the characters and Jeff Dunham is great. We have watched it several times and it just gets funnier. Worth every penny. Great to watch with friends. Be sure to get his other DVD. And watch for him to come to your town.
3,Dunham is a riot,"I am not big on stand up, but Jeff Dunham has got to be the best ventriloquist I have ever seen. The show is sure to keep you laughing. I have seen him before on the Comedy Channel, but the dvd was really a lot of fun. Rent it and get a laugh."
5,"Beware, funny bone will get tickled. Wear Depends!","OMG this is ROTFLMAO funny, much better than on Comedy Central b/c not edited and no commercial interuptions. Get it, you won't be sorry."
5,Spark of Insanity.,"Greatest comedy, performer ever. Can't see any movement in throat, mouth or lips is unreal. Everyony should own this DVD."
5,Enjoy so much,"I would recomend this dvd for anyone who loves comadie and ventrilquism. Jeff Dunham is so funny, not to mention with all his ""cohorts"" dummies. I would not show this to young children. There is a lot of language that would not be great for their ears."
5,Comedy with a spark :-),If you've seen Jeff Dunham before and liked it you will not be disappointed with this dvd. It was laugh out loud funny. The old characters were just as good as ever. The new ones certainly were just as good and a nice touch by one of the greatest ventriloquist's out there. How he does it so well I'll never know. To be funny is hard enough but to do it with another character and yourself has got to be what makes him the greatest. Knowing how to time everything and knowing how to make his characters look at the right time kept me laughing all the way through.
5,"He doesn't even need the puppets, he so funny.",His standup before he took the puppets out was very funny. We enjoyed both parts of his show. It was all great. I would definatly recommend.
5,Dunham is insane as usual!,Spark of Insanity is absolutely the best! Dunham via his alter ego friends is insane as usual. You just gotta love Achmed the Dead Terrorist.
1,I used to have faith in Amazon reviews,"Then I clicked ""Comedy"", and then filtered the results by ""Highest Rated""This DVD was the highest rated comedy feature on Amazon Prime.Plebs.Plebs everywhere."
4,Get ready to laugh,"We love Jeff - we laugh at all his ""friends"" and have shared this video with our friends. He is amazing."
4,Comic genius does it again!,"Jeff Dunham has done it again. His new character Achmed is hillarious. The bonus feature where is show him creating a new doll is great. He watched his language and didn't go all the way this ime which disappointed me a little, but he was still hillarious. A must have DVD.Thanks for the laughs Jeff."
5,Spark of Insanity,It is very funny. We laughed out loud several times and enjoy watching it over and over.
5,Hilarious,My husband and I love Jeff Dunham. And this latest skit did not disappoint us. We watch it over and over. And it's one of the first movies to be watched when we have company. It's great!
5,Jeff Dunham Spark of Insanity DVD,This ventriloquist is very funny. The characters are unique and Jeff presents them in a hilarious manner. Excellent entertainment. Very humorous.
5,Awesome Buy,"Excellent buy. I received it very fast and in excellent shape. Also, this was the funniest video I have ever seen. Buy it, you will not be disappointed."
4,I don't even like puppets!,I absolutely love this DVD and Jeff Dunham and I don't really care for puppets or anything else that is life-like. He is funny and extremely talented!
4,Jeff Dunham is a riot!!,"Probably the most talented ventriloquist of the times. He is hilarious, and skilled. The bonus footage was cool, too."
5,Susan's Review no 2,"I haven't laugh out loud in along time but Jeff Dunham can certainly do this and more. He is a great artist. His puppets, aka his friends, are unique and funny. This DVD is worth buying."
5,Insanity Rocks!,I have been a big fan of Jeff Dunhams material for years and he just gets better and better if you want to laugh this works!
4,Jeff Dunham: Spark of Insanity,"Very funny....not as funny as the first one, but still made me laugh like crazy. Still a must see."
5,"Jeff Dunham, Spark of Insanity","Oh Boy, hold on to your ribs, bcause you will laugh yourself silly. Jeff Dunham is absolutely the funniest ventriloquist ever. If you don't split a rib laughing, then there is something seriously wrong with your sense of humor. I hope Jeff puts out more DVD's in the future."
5,Laughed our butts off!!,"Jeff is one talented ""Puppet Boy""!! Bought it for my husband, and we both laughed til our sides hurt and tears running down our faces!"
4,So funny!!!!,This man is so funny and such a great ventriloquist. You will definately enjoy this purchase.
4,Jeff Dunham does it again!,"I purchased this video after watching it on my computer on Netflix. I was at work and had to work to control my laughter. I was crying by the time they got to ""Ackmed the dead terrorist"". I wasn't sure how Jeff Dunham could possibly make a terrorist funny but he has! Walter was on top of his game, even funnier and more sarcastic than before. Melvin (a new superhero) had a few funny quips but it's doubtful he'll become a regular. Ackmed is destined to become part of the act and Peanut and Jose Jalapeno are funny together as always. Jeff does a longer set on his own family life at the beginning which will have you rolling, especially the part about his daughter Kenna and their chihuahua Darby. Any fans from the first show (Arguing with Myself) will surely enjoy this one as well. I highly recommend it!"
4,Hilarious,Saw it on Comedy Central and laughed so hard. I think he is hilarious and does a good job!
5,Comedy DVD,"This is one of the funniest comedy show's I have ever watched, if anyone hasn't seen it you really need to, try to watch all of his stuff. You will be laughing."
5,ABSOLUTELY HYSTERICAL,Jeff Dunham has out done himself. Totally laugh out loud funny. All ages have sat with me and laughed. definitaly recommend it
5,Funny Stuff!,"I first saw Jeff Dunham on a You-Tube video clip of Walter that was making the rounds. I since have purchased the two DVDs from Amazon ""dot com"" and have not been disappointed. The only thing negative I can say is that some of the language could be cleaned up and it would be just as funny. I can't wait until Jeff-fuh-fuh has another release!"
5,je ff done ham dot com,This is Jeff's best dvd yet. We use his comedy daily in our lives to keep us playful. I recommend this dvd and his others to anyone who has a sense of humor. It was a great gift.
5,Jeff Dunham Spark of Insanity,This is a great dvd to add to your comedy collection!! I have fallen in love with achmed the dead terrorist character!!! I bought 2 of these. One for me and open for a family member!!
5,Jeff Dunham,One of the most creative comics that I have seen in a long time. I have to see him again and again. His dummies are hysterical! And he is really funny. They interact so well.
2,Good . . . not great,"This is the first time I'd watched one of his shows. I was prepped before hand by a huge JD fan who said he was really funny, even without his puppets.He wasn't.The first 15 minutes were standard observational/family related jokes. I was bored and waiting for the puppets.The last 65 minutes of the DVD were all about the puppets. I thought the individual skits were too long. I laughed a couple times here and there, but thought there was 5 minutes of each doll they could cut out (including the entire Peanut skit)I don't really mind stereotypical humor, but Dunham had little else to offer. Nothing groundbreaking, nothing edgy outside of a Jewish joke. So it's no surprise that most people find him extremely entertaining.If you like edgy material, look elsewhere."
2,Somewhat Funny,"Not as funny as I hoped. He is incredibly gifted at his craft, but could use the assistance of a writer. The Extra features on the DVD were really cool."
3,Somewhat Disappointed,"Juff Dunham is quite funny and much of his material is hilarious. However, I didnt expect so much sexual undertone and inuendo- He could be SO MUCH MORE FUNNIER without it and frankly could tend to a wider audience base as a result of it. Watched it once- our family decided to drop it in the trash. Have family to respect especially in a world that doesnt. Just disappointed."
3,disappointing,"having seen Jeff's other skits, I was hoping for much more. It still pretty funny, however I found his stand up to have more humor than the dolls."
5,Even funnier than his first DVD,"Not a lot to say ... have seen this at least 10 times ... and the wife and I still laugh. Shown it to some neighbors too ... they also loved it. Jeff is great .... he needs a 3rd DVD. I'll be first in line to buy it. Definitely worth at leats twice the price. If you haven't seen Jeff, you don't know what you are missing.This one is even funnier than his first DVD!"
5,Outstanding!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Jeff was my inspiration to get started and I'm so happy with my ""otto"" dummy and love to entertain!!!!!!!!!"
5,Funny stuff!,Really funny stuff! Even has an edited option for the kids! (mostly edited) The kids love it!
4,Spark of Insanity - Video,"Jeff Dunham is laugh on the floor funny. If you don't think he is funny, then you don't know what funny is. Someone has removed your funny bone."
4,lots of duplicate material,"Amazon lists this as all new material but it's not, much of it even has the exact same audience as Arguing with Myself. I saw Spark of Insanity first and loved it so much we got the earlier work and we were disappointed there was so little in the way of different material. If it weren't for the different special features I'd have suspected the disk was just a mislabeled copy of Spark of Insanity. Funny stuff but not as advertised."
5,purchase of Jeff Dunham Spark of Insanity,"very funny dvd. Shipper was a little slow shipping it out, and didn't let me know he received my order or that he shipped it. Notification from them would be nice."
3,GREAT,I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN GETTING AHOLD OF THIS PYRAMID RECORDING (MARWA) I HAVE A STAGGERING COLLECTION OF RAGA MUSIC AND WOULD READILY SWAP COPIES WITH SOMEONE.
1,Talk in General terms,"I did not find the book real helpful. It was to general and had many predictions but was sparce on good specific advice. My favorite book of this type is ""Getting Clients, Keeping Clients.""Sincerely,Thomas Cloud, Jr., ChFC"
3,Clearing things up,"I am not sending a review but would like comment on Thomas Clouds remarks. Thomas, Dan Richards wrote Getting clients/Keeping clients. Not Dan Sullivan. That said Sullivan's book, The Great Crossover is awesome! Give that one a try."
3,It's okay,"book is very detail, very informative, a little boring, thousand references, I can recommend the book for its knowledge to anyone"
4,Good affordable paper,I paint a lot and need good photo paper to reference from. The images printed out great. Good bargain for the price!
2,only one sided and not very white,Paper is heavy and prints quite well It is impossible to use paper for cards because there are text and images on the back of the paper the whiteness of the paper is not as good as I am used to. The Disney junk that came with it is worthless and I hate to think I spent $ for that
4,Great Glossy Paper,"The photos printed on this paper come out great. The only problem I have had is that it doesn't feed properly in my Brother MFC210c. This causes the printer to give me a false paper jam alert and forces me to cancel the print job and restart. Usually, the second time works, though sometimes it takes 3 or 4 tries to get it right Perhaps the paper is designed only to work with HP printers, or maybe it's my printer, I don't know. The problem I am having will cause me to rethink my next purchase, but this works for me right now as I am a amateur photographer, and only print 2 or 3 pictures a week. A professional, printing many pictures a day, would go crazy with this problem."
4,As I wished,"It is an excellent product, we use this one since long time ago with our HP printer Deskjet 9800. Best results with a combination of original color cartriges and this paper. This paper is hard to find in Canada."
1,Poor Product - Listen to Amazon Reviewers,"I should have listened. But I've had excellent DeLonghi toaster ovens for more than 12 years. The current model is terrible (the company says 625s and 650s are the same).It toasts unevenly - you can see that the top elements are hotter than the bottom ones. The crumb tray design is klutzy (turn the whole thing over and release a catch). The 625, while it looks like our old XU-22, is about 2 pounds lighter - that tells you a lot.Then I looked at the workmanship - screws were loose, the back metal panel was bowed out slightly.What to do? A new timer [costs money] - I'll install it in my old one myself (why not?). Maybe in a few years they will get themselves back together. Next time I'll listen to Amazon's reviewers..."
1,Poor design,"The dial for the timer on our first unit broke within 1 day, so we had to take it back. About 3 months later, the timer on the second unit broke for good, so that the unit never turns off and runs continuously - dangerous, in my opinion. Also, it does not toast evenly (the bottom is toasted darker than the top), and the temperature setting is not accurate - we routinely set it 25-50 degrees below normal to keep from overcooking food. Overall, cheaper units perform much better. On the upside, it has a larger capacity than most others."
1,More money is not always better!,"In my opinion, they should be giving these away! I have owned two back to back that both operated the same... The timer on both of them was broken. It sticks and causes it not to shut off and then it turn beurms your breads that you are trying to toast. If you walked away and for some reason forgot, look out, your house would be on fire before long!This was a [$$$]purchase for us and I would NEVER buy another. The timer is loud and sticks and I have owned others that were lots cheaper that gave me no problems."
2,loud ticking timer,"A nice looking unit and even has a removable crumb tray, but unfortunately the ticking on the timer is so loud you couldn't possibly forget it's on - no need for the bell when it's done cooking. If you appreciate peace and prefer quiet appliances, then this one could drive you out of the kitchen - sounds like a time-bomb ticking away. Another one of those units designed without thinking about the end user. Much like many of today's refridgerators and dishwashers - you have to do your research to find a quiet one. I decided to take this one back ASAP. I'm hoping to check out the Krups ProChef Premium, sounds like it has an actual minute timer instead of these ""you don't know how long"" count down timers. But that may just be the marketing, and we'll have to see how loud it ticks."
1,Tick - Tick - Tick,When this oven is on (toasting or baking) the mechanical timer is engaged and has a annoying tick. This is not loud but definitely audible and annoying. i am returning it right now.
1,Fire Hazard,"We've had this appliance for about 1 year and have had to have the timer replaced two times and it still doesn't work. The appliance repair shop that replaced the timers has stated that they see lots of broken timers on this model.Impact of the sticky timer: burned toast, smoke in the house. Yesterday, I had flames coming out the front of the toaster.Delonghi should recall this appliance, as it is a true safety hazard."
1,"product unsafe, a fire hazard, delonghi service area too far","In my exprience I found the product Alfredo toaster is a true fire hazard. I found flame coming out of the toaster, when I called their customer sevice number, they wanted me to write them a letter by mail ( its 21st century, Delonghi) their service center in Colorado is in Colorado Springs ( who and why they picked Colorado Springs the population center of Colorado is in Denver). I will avoid this brand."
3,Just something different to add.,"This thing takes up a little too much vertical space if you have the angle neck installed. It seems a little cheap-made, but functions properly. I'm sure it is good for those who merely shoot for cover fire without aim. I, on the other hand, like to be more precise. I give it a three as it's really a pointless add-on if you aim."
5,Written by my entrepreneurship and private equity professor.,"I have not read the book, but this looks as if it's a much more detailed version of many of the lectures that he delivered during his time teaching at Cornell. The lectures were so good that just based on those I will be buying the book.His writing and lecturing has a consistent point- to teach you to create businesses and positions that are profitable. I can't say that I've started the next Microsoft because of him, but he has been an influence on me in setting up small blogs as businesses that pay my bills with no more effort from me than a few hours of truly thinking through each blog's business plan. The latest one has been doing well within only a few weeks of being opened ( <A HREF=""http://www.musiccherry.com"" TARGET=""_blank"">MusicCherry.com</A> ), and Nesheim's classes have made it easier for me to do this. Since his newest book seems to follow the same pattern as his classes, I would expect to be just as helpful."
1,do not buy this book,"it dosent' teach you anything, if you want to waste moneybuy this book, if you want to learn something, anything, buy another book"
5,A gift to me,"I chose this set because it had that old fashion look, it was different from any other set I had seen, has it's own unique look. Once I received it I was very pleased, I also liked the coffee cups design. i loved the compliments that they were receiving. The color had cranberry hues to it quite an elegant look. I look forward to buying additional pieces."
4,Great toy for 7 year old and up,"I purchased two Blinkies for my daughters. My 9 year old got Zoe the pink blinkie and my 5 year old got Perrie. My 9 year old loves this toy and plays with it frequently. My 5 year old thought that since big sister got one that she needed one too. My mistake, I should have let her play with big sister's Zoe for a little while and saved myself the 20 dollars. My 5 year old can not read yet and one of the first things the Blinkie does when it comes on, is ask a typed message. My youngest daughter gets frustrated since she can't make the toy work properly and it's always sad and wants to go to sleep, while big sister's has the heart all full on hers. Anyway...long story short....Great for 7 and up not for little ones that can not read yet."
2,Mom's beware!,"All moms who like to bring home a child with a new toy and expect a few hours of pleasant silence to yourself while your child plays with the toy....don't buy a blinkie! At least not unless your child is at least 8 years old. It is basically a little computer and the child has to follow commands that even I find hard to understand. Even if my daughter was older, she would still have trouble understanding the ""cues"" given off by this toy. Also, the battery compartment is poorly designed and the batteries come loose causing the toy to shut off. You need to pull out the screw driver each time to open up the toy and readjust the batteries. My 4 year old wanted a blinkie too and since big sis got one,I decided to get the 4 year old one too. There is nothing she can do with it and is bored after 20 minutes of trying to make it respond to her. This toy is a let down. Don't spend the 20 dollars."
5,Lydia's Blinkie Review,"My name is Lydia and I am six years old. I love my Blinkie. If you want to keep your Blinkie from getting broken, you have to keep it away from small people, like if you have a baby brother or sister. And if you want to play the shopping game, if Blinkie's eyes blink the clothing that comes first in a row and you are not ready, then wait until the clothing comes around again the second time. Also, the clothing always comes in the same pattern."
1,AWSOME,I AM THE BIGGEST FAN OF SIMPLE FAN I DONT CARE WHAT ANYONE SAYS >>>>>> THIS ALBLUM IS THE BEST>>>>I LISTEN TO THE WHOLE THING EVERY NIGHT BEFORE I GO TO BED
2,Very disappointed,"While I really enjoy the Stargate SG-1 series I had a bad disc with the set that I originally purchased. The last two Episodes were not playable. Episode 20 played part way before locking up my DVD player and Episode 21 would not play at all.I was delighted to be able to find a replacement for SG-1 Season 7 Volume 5 in hopes that I would not have the same problem. However, the disc had the same problem as my original disc. The last two episodes were unplayable. So I'm out the money.If there is any form of restitution that would be great. I'd really like a copy that is not ruined of ""Stargate SG-1: Season 7 Volume 5."
3,Flowerhead vase,This is really cute but really small. It doesn't hold very much water and you really have to cut the flowers stems down extremely short. It is cute but I don't know if I would buy it again.
5,good cd,"good cd, but chopped and screwed cd sucks. good songs are still tippin', i'm a pimp, cash that i got,throwed, hustlez, step yo game up and magno & killa"
4,Hot album,"Swishahouse put it down on this one. Both regular version and screwed and chopped versions come with, so i Highly recomend u save some time tryin to search for these songs to download and just cop this cd its well worth the money"
2,swisha house is turnin pop,"Swisha House aint underground no more they should go do a song with Ja Rule or Ashanti. Or even better they should sign with Murder Inc.. Paul Wall aint the real Wall, this cd should not leave the stores. And if it does it should end up in the trash. Mike Jones leave these clowns before you end up like em. Next thing Swisha House is gonna be on MTV. Get wit it boys, I got love for ya'll but it just aint as hard as it was. I got every Swisha House CD. And I aint tryin to lie but this CD wasn't worth my money I should have got a bootleg."
1,PLEASE DON`T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!,"Don`t get me wrong, I luv almost anything electronica, I`ve over 500 cds and used to DJ for a living..but I don`t get it..what is the fuss about? This guy is supposed to be the next fat boy slim? there was nothing on this cd that got my attentiopn on the first listening and it`s got 3 or 4 more listens before it`s as useless as a chocolate teapot...not bland, noyt headstrong just full of little superficial tricks..where`s the soul? enuff."
3,Worthwhile read,"This book is a worthwhile read for anyone interested in the the end of times. It is a whole new set of characters based on a couple of the main characters from the Left Behind series. I don't think this book read as smoothly as any of the LB books but it is pretty good and gives a different perspective. The main thing I don't like about this book is that it has so much military jargon in it. Endless descriptions of weapons, ammunition, etc. I found it distracting and boring. I have read other reviews where other readers have found it inaccurate. I am a 33 y.o. mother of two and have no military background so I didn't see the obvious flaws mentioned in other reviews-- I was just bored with the descriptions. Something not answered in the book and I suppose will be addressed in the later books is why some of the people who seem to be believers were left behind. I look forward to the next book."
1,Not Left-Behind,"Interesting reviews of this book so far. I must say that I was very excited about a new ""Left Behind"" book. By the time I was half way through this book however, I was hoping the Rapture would occur so I would not have to finish the book.While the book is very heavy on the military descriptions of war (I expected that) I did not expect every literary cliche in the world to be in this book. I made it through 2/3 of the book and finally left it on a plane during my ride home from a business trip. I just couldn't bear to read another page.Maybe I am just accustomed to LaHaye and Jenkins. I will not be purchasing Mel's book 2."
1,Lame Born-again Clancy Wannabe,"This is the kind of book Tom Clancy would write if he were a born again Christian, or, alternately, the kind of book Jerry Jenkins would write if he were a military hardware buff. But Odom isn't up to either of those gentlemen's ability (not that I consider either of them great writers!). The main problem with so-called Christian novels is that they are too preachy & the characters & plot development take 2d place to getting out the message. This book illustrates those fault lines. The characters are one-dimensional stereotypes. Endless descriptions of military hardware & use of military jargon are no substitute for a strong plot and interesting characters. I gave up without finishing the book because the characters weren't interesting & I didn't care what happened to them. This book is a loser. Affirmative!"
2,Dissapointed,I loved Left Behind and was looking for something to read after the series ended. This story was excellent until I started getting the strange theology. The creature was just too sci-fi.
4,Another unread author,"A wonderful book that follows the La Haye belief that we will escape the tribulation by being raptured first. Problem is, like La Haye, the author cannot support his belief scripturally, like La Haye.Don't be misled by these authors, and remember that's all they are. Be prepared to witness much of the tribulation and the wrath of satan. Study your bible.."
5,Could this be Tom Clancy?,"I was expecting the same fast paced action as is in the original Lef Behind series...wrong.This book really takes you inside the military as the rapture happens.If you are expecting the book to be at the same place as Left Behind was at the end of that first book don't.This book is really detailed.Some of the reactions by the military people makes you just shake your head, but the confirntation on the USS Wasp near the end between the chaplin and a marine is priceless and is worth getting the book for."
4,Would have 5 stars if it were not outdated,"This book is very good and very agreeable to read and learn the topics. Simple plain English and fun to read.Took one star out because the edition I received is 3 years old.Nonetheless, a very good book.Just passed the Citizenship interview and test, and frankly I think I would have succeeded with only the flash cards I downloaded from the USCIS site. But then again, maybe I was simply lucky and got an easy test :)"
3,"US Citizenship for Dummies, by Cheri Sicard","Not as thorough as I'd hoped. I've had to seek other references as well (Bill of Rights, Constitution, Representatives, application for citizenship--N400)."
1,Forecast calls for me selling this book,"It was free with my purchase of Slaughterhouse-Five (I have a tendency to buy an author's most famous work last.) and Stiff: the Curious Lives of Human Cadavers, so it's not like there was any money lost in the process.By the time you get to around the 84th page, where I currently am stuck, you realize you've been dooped, that is IF you paid for this. You're going to basically read about the same events, and the same thoughts, over and over again with barely noticeable changes.Some of the things written inside the closed off areas are funny, but not, in the least beat, close to being a redeemer for this failure of satire."
1,Not worth reading...,"Even in the most twisted, misanthropic characters Chuck Palahniuk creates, there is generally something fresh and likeable about them. Unfortunately he falls far short of his past precedent in Diary. The main character, Misty, is miserable in her life, and miserable to read about. I had trouble finishing the book, and when I did I was glad it was over. The recurring thought that came to mind was, ""Who cares?"" I didn't. The story, in general, was uninteresting, and unbelievable. If you haven't read much by Chuck Palahniuk yet, read Survivor and Invisible Monsters, but don't waste your time or money on Diary."
3,A disappointment.,"This is the first novel of Palahniuk's that I have not been impressed with. (I am reading them in the order in which they were released, if that helps you know which ones that I have read so far.)All of the other stories were commentary on contemporary issues relating to society and humanity. Those stories were sometimes a little gross and a little deliberately shocking, but it all seemed to serve the larger purpose of the book.There are none of those elements in Diary. Although it is a mildly entertaining story, it contains none of the narrative on contemporary society that those other books possess. Sure, there is a half hearted attempt at talking about consumerism and how wealth eats everything, but that is only a single page in a two page chapter about ten short from the end.Instead of being a good story that talks about society, Diary is just a story. Coming from Palahniuk, that is disappointing."
4,a masterpiece in its own right,"I'll admit that getting into this book was a slow go; much slower than Choke or Invisible Monsters [for me personally.] Like his other novels, though, it grabs you, pulls you in, and sends your mind on the ride of its life.I picked this book up because an friend of mine said it inspired him to get back into art, but never imagine I'd end up so engrossed. Palahniuk brings you in as an outsider, and by the end has you seeing and experiences through the eyes of Misty Marie Wilmont. You have no choice but to succumb to the power."
4,one trick pony,"Palahniuk is a great writer of fiction. If you liked any of his books you will probably like this one. Although survivor is my favorite, they are all about equally satisfying. I get one of his books when I just want a read that I don't have to think too much about and will keep me intersted. Chuck is a bit of a one trick pony- but in a good way. There is always a surprise charector or something similar. You could be a one trick pony if your trick was always writing a good book- so I don't mean that to be a jab. I just mean that once you are turned on to this writer, you are usually not let down."
2,Out of ideas?,"I doubt I can add to any of the previous reviews, but I feel the need to contribute. I was very disappointed upon completion of this book, but mainly from the position of a Palahniuk fan. I felt as though Palahniuk was trying too hard to be Palahniuk, as if he was pressed for ideas and ""forced"" the words onto paper. Nothing about this book grasped my attention and I only completed the read with the hope that something would make it all worth while in the end. Didn't happen. If you have read Chucks previous works then you will probably be unhappy. If you have never read Palahniuk before, then this book may impress you since it is still better than alot of books out there."
2,more of the same - but not as good as the rest,"I was an avid Chuck fan for years. I pimped his book on all of my friends and family. This latest, though...It read like some other author trying to sound like Chuck. The plot was absurd and the twists were predictable.Mr Palahniuk is still one of my favorite authors, but his books are getting harder and harder for me to read."
4,A nice addition to any library,I always look forward to a Chuck Palahniuk new books because the subject matter always engross me and brings me back.
3,My favorite author.,"My favorite author lays a bit of an egg here. Nice payoff, but couldnt we have gotten to this point in a short story? This book doesnt get going until the last 10 pages or so."
5,A Different View,An exploration into an artists life that found inspiration through personal tragedy. Yet another Palahniuk classic.I am convinced that the modern mainstream collective concept of reality is at times completely backwards. If you hold court in the same arena of conviction then this book is for you. Chuck Palahniuk never fails to make a strong argument for disagreement.
4,"""Diary"" - A review","I am quite surprised to see so many bad reviews for this novel. This, by far, was my favourite Palahniuk novel. And for one exact reason, that it was circling in my mind for weeks later.The first chapter, starts with a bang, with the whole comparison of the three layers of skin and the three women in a man's life. I literally could not put it down, I locked myself in my room for 2 days to finish it. And in a stange creepy way, I fell in love with Peter Wilmot. I could actually understand why Misty was so attracted to him.Lullaby, Survivor, Invisible Monsters... these were all good. But ""Diary"" is one novel that really caught my attention."
5,Another great novel!,"Once again, Palahniuk proves himself to be the modern master of the anti-consumer novel. This is the coma diary of a repressed artist, whose husband is being sued for scrawling nasty messages in the rooms he's been remodeling. Hilarious, lively and fun -- I found myself sucked into it instantly. If you're a fan of this man's work, then I highly recommend it! His best novel since Choke and Fight Club! Also, recommended: The Losers' Club by Richard Perez."
1,"Freshman Year, English 101","There's a brilliant Shirley Jackson short story called ""The Lottery."" Once I made it to the ""fairy tale"" or paranormal or whatever-you-wanna-call-it level of Diary, I realized this is Ms. Jackson's plot rehashed. If you want a book about an entire community that is psycho, toss out the book and rent the movie Hot Fuzz. Much better portrayal of the concept of ""for the good of the community."" And dust off that old American Lit book. I love Chuck, but this book fell flat."
1,Really wanted to like it,"I really wanted to like this book. I have liked several of Chuck's other offerings but this one was not up to par with what he is capable of. About 50 pages into this book, had I not been trapped on a plane, I would have rolled down my window and sent it on its merry way. Perhaps a passing squirrel or moose would like to kill a few hours reading about a pathetic lady that only gets more pathetic as the pages very slowly pass by. Perhaps a passing bear would like something conveniently sized to wipe his omnivoric buttox with. My time would been better served reading government documents on proper disposal of printer toner."
4,Chuch is Chuck,"Chuck Palahniuk is if anything predictable. His books seem to always explore the big picture through details. He seems to take the normal and dissect until it is absurd. Lullaby is his standard example and innovated brilliance in as much of a combination as you can get. For those of you who watched Fight Club and enjoyed figuring out how soap making could degrade social destruction by way of the essence of male bonding; you will enjoy how a the muscels in your face can describe three different ways of dealing with suicide. This was Chuck's most inspring book, as it looks at where the seeds of our own creativity lie. However, reading three of his books in six months became a little repetitive for my tastes."
3,"After I read this book, an alien took over my body and....","ok, that's not true. this book is good, that is true. it's slow like a diary should be. i can't think of anything to compare it to. if you are coming off of serious antidepressants and have reality slips, i suggest delaying this book until your doctor says it's ok. the book is blurry. you read it and think you know what what will happen and then you are wrong. or i was . and there was not an alient. which was sad....i would have liked a disco alien....can you hear me now, Chuck?"
1,Zzzzzz,"I took a mild liking to Chuck's other book ""Haunted"" for being delightfully grotesque. So... I thought I'd give this one a try. It took me a month to get to the middle of this. I couldn't finish it. In fact I had to stop reading for a couple of weeks. It made reading boring for me. It was uninteresting, repetitive, and ever so slow. Even now I'm having problems picking up any book in fear that it will be just as boring as this one. I hate wasting my time.Thanks Chuck."
5,not at all a let down.,"Despite what these other reviews are saying, I was not at all let down by this book. I never once found it hard to follow; it fit the form of the rest of Chuck's books. The way he writes always keeps the reader guessing, and this book was no exception. The plot twists in this book were just as shocking as they were in all of his other books. I was reading this book before bed to help me sleep and I ended up staying up all night instead just to finish the second half of the book because i got so into it. As far as it being depressing, Palahniuk has been made famous for his dark humor, it's a part of his style. Diary is a beautifully written book. It takes the reader into a supernatural world that no one would ever believe could exist, but Palahniuk really makes the reader feel it."
2,Aliens have abducted Chuck,"Nothing like his other works. I loved ""Choke""...I loved ""Survivor."" Nine out of ten subjects blind folded and read ""Diary"" at bed time agree that it was written by Elizabeth Berg or Anne Tyler on crack. Two stars for the Foley bag. Although this is my least favorite to date, the man can write. I will be tackling the library clerk as she shelves his next book. My goal is to turn on more 42 year old mothers like myself on to this talent."
1,Save yourself from undoubted fits of nacrolepsy.,"It seems like Palahniuk is stuck in a lyrical rut that comes out more and more recycled with each novel, and although this was fine through the first five novels (with the exception of Invisible Monsters-which is probably slightly worse than Diary) it really bottoms out here.Insert comically dark one-liner here.Reinterate said one-liner every fourth paragraph.If anything, stick with Survivor, Choke, or Fight Club."
5,"""Couldn't put it down""","I agree with many reviewers, this is his (your) best work to date. It isn't as scary as Lullaby; or as action packed as Choke, Fight Club, or Survivor, yet his (your) brush strokes of the human language is unparalled. Sad yet prolific, this book is just fun to read. Strange as it may sound, Diary reminded me of something by Ayn Rand. There is no doubt, Palahniuk (you) is from another world. I'll always be anxiously awaiting his (your) next publication. If you want to read a book which will leave you wondering what you just read, read any of Chucks books. They're addicting, so be very careful."
4,"Diary lacks depth...interesting story idea, though.","Palahniuk is gifted with a vision for relating stories that other people most likely couldn't even come up with a premise for. In that regard, he is wonderful.Diary lacked depth. The character of Misty...i felt like i knew her a little, but I'd hope so since it was she narrating the story.What's bad: you will want to know more about Tabbi, Peter, Grace and Harrow...and you will wish to god that more time was spent on the relationship between Peter and Delaporte.This could be made into a movie, but unless the plot is modified, it will be a baseless film.I expect too much from Palahniuk, and that is my own miserable mistake.I am absolutely not saying that this book is crap..it just could have been so very much better."
2,"Decent book, but not his best","As an avid fan of Chuck Palahniuk I was quite disappointed to read ""Diary"". This book aspires to be something it is not, interesting and clever.I have read every book by Mr. Palahniuk and this is my least favorite. As I was reading I got the impression that this book was written because it was time for another book to come out, not because Chuck had inspiration.""Survivor"" is my favorite with every other book except ""Choke"" residing in my top ten, but this book lacked what those others had, a cohesive somewhat plausible plot twist. The book started slow, but got me very excited as it led to the final plot twist that was thrown together and poorly done.This book is worth reading once, but do not expect to be blown away by it."
2,Chuck is channeling Anne Rice,"I wish I would've trusted the negative reviews and at least waited till this came out on paperback, but I've loved every previous Palahniuk novel.Of course, the writing style is still great, but the storyline is so contorted that you're fully half way through the book before you begin to realize that this novel has a plot closer to something Anne Rice would have thrown away as an early manuscript in her Lasher series than anything Chuck has written before. You keep thinking that some ridiculous plot twist is going to turn the story back into something really intriguing, instead of a sad paranormal misadventure.One of the things I love about Palahniuk novels is how he makes an interesting story about really screwed-up people trying to make sense of a world they don't fit into. This story is about a fairly normal woman living in a town of screwed-up people waiting for a savior.Not a horrible book, but by far the worst Palahniuk novel."
2,Depressing,"This is the first Chuck P. book I've ever read. I should have started with something else... maybe Choke or Fight Club. Chuck concentrates on such details in this book, such as facial muscles and expressions, that it pauses the actual story line of the book. With that said, he does have a sense of humor that shows up, though very sparsely, throughout the book."
3,Good read,"This one is very easy Palahniuk to read - no interesting shifts in time or pronoun use. I found it very predictable and wish he had just gone ahead and subtitled it ""The Lottery."" I think I am actually a little disappointed in this one."
2,Not Chuck's best,For a while over the summer i was reading a book and finishing it within a week. i had been reading a lot of chucks work continuously so i picked up Diary. I got it about 2 and a half months ago and i still havent finished it. im at about page 229 of 260. i just cant get into this one.
3,Old money crazy lives,"I buy Chuck Palahniuk books (all of them) because he won me over with ""Fight Club,"" and even the books of his I like the least had some entertaining points. Palahniuk's imagination seems to have no limits, and digging into the old money world of pretentious affluence and their suffering lives was certainly something new to read.Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author"
3,"Palahniuk is a great writer,....","but as with Lullaby, he seems to be exploring in a realm of uncomfortable subject matter. While it is interesting and vivid, I would say that Choke and Survivor are his greater works."
5,Am I the only one who feels this?,"DIARY to me is Chuck Palahniuk's best book. It has all of the previous books' outrageous musings but he fills the book with a strange sentimentality and tenderness. Well, as sentimental and tender as you can get in a Palahniuk book. The plot while outlandish like most of his other ones, to me seemed strangely grounded in reality and the whole book seemed to enclosed with claustrophia and dread and mistrust of the people who should trust. I would love for Palahniuk to take on the proverbial American family. Take the Beavers for a ride. Spit on ridiculous and ficticious Americana and just make up your own. His version of THE CORRECTION would it involve cannibalism? This book is an effortless read and highly recommended."
4,have no clue,my daughter got this under my account i have no clue about it maybe it works maybe not buy it and find out
2,Very Dissapointing,"Chuck Palahniuk is one of the few novelists writing today whose talent actually seems to decline with every new book. I picked up Diary with some trepedition, having been disappointed with both Choke and Lullaby. In the case of all 3 books, Palahniuk (as always) came up with a facinating plot, but failed to carry it out wth the energy and humor of his earliar works. Mabe third person narrative is a weak point for Palahniuk? For people interested in Palahniuk's earliar works, I would reccomend Fight Club (who would'nt?) and Invisible Monsters."
2,Can you feel this? Because I can't.,"I like Palahniuk. I just think he's playing himself out. Up until this point, ""Choke"" was the only book I hated. I wouldn't say I hate ""Diary,"" but I sure as hell didn't like it. The one good thing about it is that at least it is a little different. But he does rewrite his own dialogue and reuse little repetitive techniques that have been around since his first book. When I first read his books, they were new and great, original and raw. Now...yeah, he's overplayed in his own way. I can't feel this. Not even if you put a needle through my arm. I recoomend his earlier works (""Fight Club,"" ""Survivor,"" ""Invisible Monsters"") and of his most recent works, ""Lullaby."""
2,What a disappointment,"I anxiouslly awaited the realese of Palahniuk's sixth novel, after being enchanted by the first five I expected the same for Diary, well it didn't happen. I never thought I would say this about Chuck Palahniuk's work, but this was awful. It went nowhere for about three quarters of the novel, it seemed like I was rereading the same chapter for 200+ pages. There were no characters in the book that were remotely interesting, nor did I care what happened to them. There isn't much to sumarise because there isn't enough context to eleborate on whats written in the dust-jacket. I'm hoping that his next novel makes up for Diary. To fans of Palahniuk, I'd wait for the paper-back."
3,Preposterously entertaining,"Chuck Palahniuk seems to understand that all great literature has an element of strangeness to it. In DIARY, however, there isn't much else. Stylistically, the repeated tics quickly become annoying: ""The forecast for today is...""; ""For the record...""; and several others which you will come to know and not love. The characters will alternately creep you out and bore you with their falsity. But the story is entertaining, and sidebars on Jung, artists, and builders keep things boiling along to nice payoff."
3,"ok?...im a bit confused, but.....","this is the first book i have read by chuck palahnuik, though this isnt the best book i have read, it makes me want to read some of his other books...'diary' was a lot of the time hard to follow and confusing, and during the end i was about ready to throw a fit because it was so depressing and i felt so bad for some of the characters, (expessially Misty) and also ended up hating a lot of the other characters...the end kinda lost me, though i think i caught most of the book....and also most of this book is kinda twisted (not like a really gross twisted, just the kind of twisted where you definetly wouldnt want to be in the characters situation{i, personally, would have probably killed myself}) Sometimes its repetitive....but no matter if all the things i just mentioned sound good or bad to you, it makes the book what it is"
2,"Buy ""Choke"" not this","Unlike JR Pinto's review I will warn of any spoilers! I am a big Palahniuk fan. This book was bad. Not bad good, bad bad. ""Choke"" was much better, For serious!"
3,Not his best...,"The beginning is a promising start, but as you start getting further and further into the novel, the more you want to stop reading. I'm a huge fan of Chuck Palahniuk's work, and I enjoy reading his morbid and gruesome take on the world around us, but this story seemed like it would never end. Not my favorite story by him, but still better than many other things I've read"
5,CP hits stride with Diary,"As a reader of all his previous novels, I've come to appreciate CPs' no-holds-barred writing. Yet Diary's ability to be edgy and smooth, macabe and familiar, at the same time infected me like nothing I've ever read before or since. The novel's economy of words inspired a depth of imagery that is pure genius. One of Chucks' novels appeals to everyone; Diary certainly spoke to me. In spades."
2,I guess I just don't get it,"I guess I'm not ""artsy"" enough to ""get"" this book. I mean, I consider myself a pretty intelligent person, and an avid reader, but this book was very disappointing.I don't empathize, at all, with the main character, Misty. In fact, I don't really understand or follow any of the characters in the book, and the ""shocking"" ending is hardly shocking. I will say that it's not as predictable as many other books out there, but the climax was a big let down. I was left thinking, ""That's it? I wasted my money on this?""I haven't read any of Chuck Palahniuk's other books, and I'm not sure that I want to. This one was a big waste."
2,Not as good as his other works,"I am dissappointed to say that this title by Chuck is not of the same quality as his other works. It seems that many of the reviews here are inflating the rating of this book because of their respect for his other works. Yes, the first page lures you in, but he quickly loses momentum within a couple of chapters. If you are a die-hard fan, read a couple of chapters before purchasing. Chuck-- take a breather and take your time to craft another masterpiece."
4,Keeps you guessing,"I wouldn't say the ending is the best, given the build up.... but the entire book has you thinking ""what the hell is going on"" and the feeling you have reading throughout the entire book makes it very interesting to read."
4,"Not bad, not bad at all","A pretty weird novel. You need to keep focus so you wont get thrown or turned off by the ""experimental"" structure. Some people are apparently ticked off by this, no wonder Finnegan's wake is seldom considered Joyces and probably overall literature's greatest ""acheivement"".The diary structure is not linear at all, not always focusing on the main character. Apparently not always written by the same person. Nevertheless this schizophrenic emphasis on not being clear and in control and slowly going crazy, gives it its charm.Its unique aspect is that the feel and ambiance is exactly the same as Silent Hill 2."
3,A rolling stone collects no moss.....,"Ok! I've never had so much troubble finishing a book by Chuck Palahniuk. He's one of my favorite authors, but this book took me literaly a year to read because it couldn't keep my attention.HOWEVER!!!!!!When I did finally finish it, I fell in love with it. The whole book is just building up to the end and that's it. Everything that you're confused about, question, or think might happen is wrong. It's such a great twist that it makes the whole book. But like I said it all amounts to the end."
2,Big Letdown,"I'm a fan of Palahniuk's other works, but this one just doesn't do it for me. I didn't care what happened to the rather dull, uninteresting main character. The diary format repeats itself too often. It wasn't a terrible book, and you know that there will be a surprise at the end, but it's not worth the 200+ pages of boring diary entries to find out what it is. Go read ""Choke"" instead."
1,Repetitive drivel,"Reading this book is a bit like being repeatedly clubbed on the head, and I don't mean that as a compliment. If you are going to repeat the same sentence twenty times, at least pick a good one. Also irritating is Palahniuk's penchant for displaying his dimestore erudition, especially since he makes several rather glaring factual errors. If you are looking for a good book about painting, take a look at Maugham's ""The Moon and Sixpence"" or Robertson Davies' ""What's Bred in the Bone."" (Robertson Davies also actually knows how to do research.) Don't bother with this crap."
2,I expected as much,The book was pretty bizzare but enjoyable. All this authors stories are bizzare so I expected this to be no different.
4,creepy...but enjoyable.,"Usually, I stay away from books that give me the heebie-jeebies...but when I picked this one up, I couldn't stop. Palahnuik does a wonderful job of keeping the plot hidden from the reader until the exact moment that it will scare us the most. The plot is unique, for sure, and the style in the form of a woman's diary is very intimate. It's a really, really quick read; I reccommend it for a little scary weekend escape."
5,In the Meantime,I love all Iyala's book they keep me stable in my life. Her words have made me look at my life in a different way she is an inspiration to many of us that are going through hard times.
2,Its O.K.,I bought this book when I saw Ms Vanzant on Anderson Cooper Live. It's basically another self help book an not all that orginal.
2,must read in the meantime,I love iyanla so much! this book is a true inspiration and a blessing. it is a must read for anyone doing a little soul searching or in my case a lot of soul searching.
1,What a disappointment,"I brought this book for my inspirational group and received a completely different book that was an asian novel comic book. I have yet to hear from the sellers concerning this, but due to the error, I now will be behind in the group. Not satisfied at all."
1,Who is she kidding,"I can't believe how many people liked this incredibly stupid book! Everyone said ""you've gotta read this"" so I did. From the getgo I realized it is a big joke! This book is like that old story about the Emperor's New Clothes! They're all saying it is ""meaningful"" but the real truth is that there is no meaning at all in it! The author cloaks obtuse psycho-babble in metaphors which sound ""deep"" but mean absolutely nothing! Save your money for a new dress!"
2,Disjointed and difficult,"There are glowing comments about this book here, but it is way over-rated in my opinion. Although I did get a few things out of it here and there, overall I found it very difficult to put this stuff all together. This is a difficult book to read. After I finished it, I loaned it to a friend who wanted to read it, and she couldn't finish it. I have gained much more from other books. Another book with a similar theme that you may want to look into (ie, that you go through a process of ""climbing up the mountain"" to recreate your life) is Rebuilding, by Bruce Fisher - this is intended for people going through divorce, and it is first rate."
5,Excellent,"I have recently separated from my wife. I found this book to be very inspiring. I learned a great deal from this book and even more from ""One Day my Soul Just Woke Up,"" by the same author. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone. Easy to understand an read."
2,In the Meantime is on the ground floor.,"Although I found this books interesting in its own way, I became bored after a while of reading. The book dragged on about self cleansing, but gave no real suggestions on how to keep yourself from falling back into the basement."
1,Poorly written and an even poorer message,"My wife and I have been married 11 years, things have been better between us. We both went out and bought books to help with the relationship (or so I thought). After reading the book my wife explained that we should ""wait and see"". I, at the same time, read the 7 Principles of Marriage. My take was, our relationship is bent not broken, let's try to fix it together. After reading half of ""in the meantime"" I see where she got her opinion of ""action"". You have two choices from the book: 1. Do nothing until ""inspiration"" hits 2. Throw away everything and start over. Either way the book gives no other options or practical examples to move ahead together in a positive way. Don't waste your time and hope to God that your significant other doesn't get a hold of this book."
2,Very little practical help,"Maybe it was a poor abridgement, but it seemed like too much story and not enough, ""So now that we agree this is what's going on, what do we actually DO about it?""Ms. Vanzant reads the book herself, and she's a pleasure to listen to, but I really didn't get much out the experience."
2,A Dissenting Point of View,"I DID NOT ENJOY THIS BOOK! She writes in metaphor incessantly, the major one being ""cleaning house"" and offers very little by way of concrete advice. I'm still not sure what she is trying to say. ""You are the love that you need"" -- wthat does that mean? If this book helps others, that's great. But I didn't get it."
4,If it is meant to be,"I have read this book many times, and each time I find joy and comfort in what is written within the pages of it. I have read the reviews of others that said they got little to nothing out of the book and it didn't pertain to their particular life. Well maybe not, but it is an overall view of life and lifes situations. I truley belive that if you are not ready to accept the facts and the information she has given, you will be on of those people who do not like the book. If you are ready to stand tall where you are at, and in who you are, she gives you the tools to do so!"
4,A Good Guide to Better Relationships,"This book is a good 'how to' guide to loving and healthy relationships. Vanzant not only tells us the 'how and why'in her 'down-to-earth' style, but also, illustrates her points with real life examples that drive her points home! If you read this book and take it to heart, you have a much greater chance to find yourself and the love you want!"
2,Don't bother getting the book if you are single...,"Got the book thinking it would assist me in getting through a rough single phase... Didn't. The book is a nice read - tells you everything's okay - you just need to straighten up a bit - but nothing terribly meaningful or enlightening. Mrs. Vanzant is a wonderful speaker, but, in my opinion, this book fell short. Most all of the scenarios involved people in unhappy relationships - well leave, that's easy enough. But for single people, there is very little that this book offers. Sure, learn to love yourself, don't sell yourself short, and be respectfult to yourself and others. That's nice, really, but it does little to fix anything. I don't mean to sound bitter, but I was disappointed with the work overall."
2,Disappointing,"I love Ayanla when I have seen her on Oprah, interacting with women who need her kind of boost to their self-esteem. She speaks dramatically to the problems many women experience in getting stuck in a cycle of bad relationships. I suppose the CD will remind some women of the response they had to her writings and her presence. But if you are not of that mind, it can't do much for you.The music is mostly REMAKES! Excuse my language, but Cain't nobody sing ""Ain't No Way"" but Aretha!"
1,Where's the helpful advice,This book is a waste of time. There isn't anything to help you with getting out of the meantime. It's just alot of writting about how great it is to be out of the bad part of life and in the good part.How to get to the good part is everyone's best guess.
4,"""in the meantime"" inspirational artist and music..the best",i have read iyanla vanzants work and have viewed her on oprah....did not know how well this would work in this medium.....it was my best buy.....exceeded my expectations....this will inspire and make your spirit fly....money well spent......
5,A must!!!!!,This Cd is such a great listen! Iyanla your an angel. This is a CD you just put in and don't stop it till it's over!
4,Get Ready,"If you are committed to finding inner truth and uncovering hidden obstacles that may clutter your path to happiness --- get ready because this book offers terrific advice. Though In the Meantime can be dense reading, be patient as it does deliver wholeheartedly. I highly recommend it and have given this book to many friends. Cheers, Iyanla!"
2,For those in search of meaning,"For those in search of meaning in their life, pass this book by unless you enjoy a light, not very well written, redundant, and not very insightfull book that relates everything that happens in life and stages of life to the levels of a house. The analogy gets old by the second chapter. The author's insights are limited and of common knowledge to those who have been questing for meaning for 6 months or more. Pass on this book and look for a more meaningful book that does not try to fit everyone and everything into one of her house's floors. Life must be dull for this author because she seems to see in black and white rather than the way I see life: an irradiant rainbow of changing and unpredictable color combinations. I did not even finish the book - I felt my time would be better spent doing the laundry and day dreaming."
5,in the meantime the cd version,"The cd version of this book is wonderful as is the book. The music is catchy and the words are very meaninful, just like the book. Iyanla's introductions before each song are uplifting. I love everything this women writes and does. She has helped me find myself. I am not a women of color, but a women. I do think men can also benefit from her words of wisdom, if they would let themselves open up and read her works."
5,A Book Every One Should Read!,If you are at a point in your life where you feel unfulfilled in your love relationship(s) you have to read this book. This book is fantastic. Once you start reading it I guarantee you won't be able to put it down. It is such a wonderful guide to a deeper understanding of ourselves. You'll be amazed by the courage you will find in yourself to make the necessary changes to find the wonderful kind love that you so rightfully deserve.
1,Don't waste your money on this one,"Too bad. Ms. Vanzant is a delight in person, but this book is pure drudgery. Nothing new here. The ever-long-running calendar of events in the lives of Jean and Paula and James and Bruce and David, etc., etc., is tiring. After a few chapters of this, who cares? Totally useless, unintelligent characterizations. Just a mishmash of everyone's problems with no intelligent answers. If you want to solve your problems in the ""talk-show"" manner, this book is for you, but I'm better off finding answers on my own."
5,MY MY MY ! Iyanla Vanzant has done it again,"As always Mrs. Vanzant has done it again. ""In the meantime"", deals with the many relationships we encounter with family, friends, and with ourselves and the problems we face in these relations. As Iyanla explores the different levels in loves house she gives practical tools in how to leave the basement and if applied cautiously can lead you into the attic of unconditional love. Once again another one of her books makes the winners list. Enjoy!"
3,New York agrees with Michigan and Arizona.,"Somewhat helpful, but too vague. My roommate couldn't get through it and she reads everything. She recommended Undoing Depression, said that there was more concrete advice in three chapters on relationships in that book than in the whole of Meantime. She was right!"
4,An important book for any woman or man in search of truth,The book can be vague at times. Personally I found the first third repetitous and I began to think it would never get to the nuts and bolts. By the time I finished I was completely blown away. This book is a must have for anyone who is truly searching for themselves and/or that special someone. My definition of love has changed entirely. Open your heart and mind and read this book.
5,DEFINATELY A MUST HAVE BOOK FOR ALL WOMEN,I'm 23-years old and I have been through some things in my life which I could never understand without having read this book. It thoroughly explains how one determines what they want and the best MEANS to go about getting it.
1,No negative stars?,"Who is Oprah kidding? This book barely even qualifies as a book--after reading as much of it as I could stand, I'm not even sure the author is literate. It sounds as if it was dictated into a tape recorder by someone who wasn't much for public speaking, either. The author sounds like a nice enough person, but there is almost nothing in the way of ""content"" in this book. Spend your money and time on one of Barbara DeAngelis's books."
2,dissatisfied cstomer,"i ordered a new book and i received a used book with stains on it, very dissatisfied with this book"
2,"DO NOT waste your time in the ""MEANTIME"" !","I was hoping this book would be more positive. I didn't find the examples of other couples unrelated to my current situation or worth reading about. Actually, I could care less about these fictitious people anyway !!!! I was hoping that the author wouldn't waste hundreds of pages telling me to ""wait"" and ""hope for better things"" while in the MEANTIME.....after reading this...I WILL NOT WAIT in the meantime BUT live my life being happy NOW not dwelling on a failed relationship...if this doesn't make any sense...exactly...either does the book!don't waste your money !"
1,IT'S A SHAME,"IT'S A SHAME THAT IYANLA WAS ABLE TO DECIEVE ""CHRISTIAN"" ARTISTS TO DO SUCH A PROJECT. SHE DOESNT BELIEVE THAT JESUS IS LORD SO WHY WOULD A BELIEVER SING ON A PROJECT WITH SUCH A PERSON. SHE IS EVIL, AND SEDUCTIVE. GOSPEL ARTISTS MUST NOT SELL THEIR FAITH SO CHEAPLY, JUST FOR PUBLICITY."
3,Not so good!,"This was not what i expected. Usually, I will breeze through a good book. This picks up at places then dives to boring at other places. I have finally put it down for another time."
4,Meantime,"I kept reading parts of this book before I bought it. It has struck so close to home, but I was not ready to read the whole book, therefore I loan it to one of the women in our healing circles. We are Native American and identify closely with the author. It is a good book, to help with our issues."
5,Finding the one in you...,"This book has changed my life forever...I read it during my messy marriage, during my separation and after my divorce. Each time I was moving up a level in ""Love's Home"". Now I'm in the Attic and life is truly amazing...To all who are sick and tired of being abused and neglected this book will truly heal you...Now all you need to do is read it until you are in the Attic too...Thanks for the insights Iyanla Vanzant...Life is great thanks to you and God. May God bless you on your journey home...To Joshua, Jeremy and Robert my Meantime men...life is best in your arms...forever yours Jeanette Summers............!!!!"
4,In the Meantime - The Bomb,"I don't need 1000 words. I found the CD quite enlightening, refreshing at times and very much a start to healing. It hit the nail on the head in many cases and was like it was made just for me. Thank you, I really needed it."
4,Excellent Fusion,"This CD is an excellent fusion of motivational speech and secular and gospel music. This CD enables you to be inspired through the spoken and sung words. Whenever I'm feeling melancholy about being in my ""meantime"", I pop in this CD and let the words and songs uplift me out of my funky mood. I would recommend this CD for the days when nothing seems to be going right and the only soothers would be a cup of warm tea and music."
5,"Excellent,Excellent, Excellent",This Cd will hit home to alot of people. Very spiritual and inspirational
5,Wonderful Book,"I received this book as a gift, and have since gifted several family members and friends with the same book. It is not just a ""good"" book, but an ""important"" one that can be read again and again."
2,Bad writing spoils what could be a good book,"While the message of this book is as wonderful and uplifting as everyone else has mentioned, the author's editor should be fired. I found the writing style so distracting that I could barely finish the book. Anecdotes appear with seemingly no connection to the previous paragraph, the same thought is repeated a million different ways, and the organization of the book is terrible. Maybe Iyanla should stick to public speaking, because writing is not her forte. I'd go with another book that offers more practical advice and less rambling."
2,In the Meantime waits for Iyanla's future work,"In the Meantime is well titled. Iyanla wrote this when she was much younger in her craft and it shows. She bounces from idea to epithet without much restraint. She will later hone her ideas into wonderfully concise and ordered thinking with her devotional study: One Day My Soul Just Opened Up. I also have used for almost ten years, her amazing work: Until Today. The best devotional book I've ever used, she also works divergent philosophies, but they deserve a daily musing regardless, and always seem divinely relevant. She is truly amazing."
1,Bad Bad Bad,"i am a very good user for Cobra Walkie talkie but this model is so so bad first one of the two hands came died and the other hand died after two days, what a bad thing is it..."
4,"good radio, not so good range","Being a Cobra 2-way radio, this unit has excelent features, plenty of battery juice even with heavy usage and good quality reception IF you are in a relatively clear area. Don't expect the range to be even close to the claimed 8 mi range. More like 2 mi, in my experience, if you use it in an average forest camping area. Still worth the $$ I guess, but beware of its range limitations"
4,great boats,I have had very good luck with these boots. I am on my 5th pair. The last couple of pairs I have had trouble with the treads splitting out. Even with that they are still waterproof. Im not going to buy any other boots.
4,Bad-@ss Boots,"I love these boots. They're stylish, sturdy, warm, comfy... only a few drawbacks.1) They're expensive.2) They're VERY warm (not so good for summertime in Florida, as I'm finding out... my socks are super sweaty).3) The leather on the toe ends up getting scuffed and scraped too easily. Wouldn't be a big deal if it just scuffed, but chunks are actually coming out of the toe of my boot after less than 6 months. Carhartt would do well to protect the OUTSIDE of the toe from damage... they've already waterproofed and steel-toed these boots, and at something like one-fifty per pair, it's a shame the toe leather is so easily damaged.Other than that... very happy with these. Great boots."
2,Disappointing Best of Rock,"Was quite disappointed with this box set. I don't think that is deserves the title ""The Best of Rock"".....some of the tracks shouldn't be in here and there are many more that are missing."
5,Great Tunes - Great Album,"This is a really great ska/pop/rock record by the ex-(English) Beat member. I really don't know why this didn't do better and get more heard. I got it used about 16 years ago and It's on my iPod right now. I was going to list my favorites, but I can't because EVERY song is great. Snag this."
1,XU-650 & XU625,The company tells me the XU650 & XU625 are structurally and mechanically the same - we returned our XU625 after one day. The person who liked the one she purchased 6 years ago probably got a better made device. DeLonghi quality has declined. See my review under the XU625.
1,Totally unhappy,"Your toaster oven is incredibly slow, by the time the bread is toasted, it is as hard as a rock. Also, the timer only works about 50% of the time. Broiling is also very slow."
2,Minor Rohmer indeed,"Why this featherweight effort remains in print while a vastly superior Rohmer film like ""Pauline at the Beach"" does not is a question that only New Yorker Films can answer. There are at least eight other Rohmer flicks you should see before this one."
2,was it really tanya who wrote this book?,"I have sat with great expectation for each new tanya huff book release and have always been rewarded with a great story. This time the usual author obviously was sick. Although, it was nice to see the victory nelson series and tony's story continue, there were none of the usual humorous antics and plot work that I had come to expect from tanya. The story is painfully slow and I had to force myself to finish the book. Usually, I don't sleep the night I bring a ""huff"" book home becuase I want to know how it ends. DO read everything else by huff, but unless more stories continue from this book, don't bother to buy it. DON'T waste your money on the hardcover like I did."
5,Tanya Huff Smoke and Mirror Trilogy,"Continuation of series loved whole series, I enjoyed TV show was sorry it ended withou completing the story soI bought the books to find out the endings"
5,The Show MUST go on...,"The house was great for the next episode of Darkest Night and CB Productions had rented it for the whole week. It was the perfect turn of the century, last century, mansion and was a great setting for the ghost story.Only problem Tony Foster had with it was that it really had ghosts. Lots of ghosts. Many who had died in the house. The house, or something in the house, fed off the ghosts. And it wanted more food.Now Tony, without Henry Fitzroy to help him, must find out what is going on, get the rest of the crew to listen to him and get out using his knowledge of how the house works and what magic he knows. Before too many people die.Dark humor, not that scary unless reading it at night, good, dirty, fun. In some ways I enjoyed this more than Smoke And Shadows."
4,A good read,"While I also enjoyed Smoke and Shadows better, I still enjoyed Smoke and Mirrors. Tony Foster has long been one of my favorite Tanya Huff characters. He's both realistic and a riot to read. There were a few points that I would have liked to have been dealt with further, but I'm guessing (hoping) that there will be a third book in which these things will be further addressed.And I would personally love to see a crossover book featuring Tony and Henry and my other favorite Tanya Huff cast of characters, the Summon the Keeper gang. Can you even imagine Tony and Diana working together? They would definitely test the patience of Henry and Claire.Looking forward to more!"
4,Just like being there...,"I read a large chunk of this book while working on a film set for an indy short, and found myself thinking over and over, ""This is my life, but with a bigger budget!"" For the first chapter or so, at any rate. For the later chapters, it was less with the spooky on my end.The book was very well written, which is what we have come to expect of Ms Huff. The sense of humour and well-paced story kept me vastly entertained through several 15-hour days of hurry-up-and-wait. I highly recommend it."
4,convenient and well-priced,"I was surprised at how well the coffee/espresso/cappucino machine worked, considering its relatively low price. Drip-stop is great when you're in a rush for your first cup of joe. The machine is easy to clean with the dishwasher-safe parts. The milk frother has tremendous capacity too. I definitely recommend this one."
5,The perfect coffee pot!,Finally our search for the perfect coffee maker is over. This coffee pot makes the most wonderful coffee. It has a filter inside that filter's out any chemical taste in the water you use to brew your coffee. It comes with a permanent metallic filter for your ground coffee -- you can use paper if you prefer since the metal basket lifts right out. The milk steaming apparatus is easy to use. We have had this pot for a few weeks now and have never had a bad cup of coffee when using it. It's a wonderful pot! We are happy we bought it and if you buy one you'll be happy too!
4,Fabulous machine,"I love this coffee maker/cappuccino maker. The milk is frothed PERFECTLY each time. The auto timer is fantastic and the cleanup is easy. Only thing that needs fixing is possibly more room for the cup (I drink large cups of cappuccinos) so that the milk doesn't fly everywhere. OTHER THAN THAT, IT'S A PREMIUM PRODUCT !!"
2,Very Misleading,"OK. For those who don't want to get burned, all this is is a regular coffee maker with a milk frother. ""American Style Cappucino"" is perhaps one of the most misleading things I've heard since someone said they had a ""little"" problem at Enron. It makes American style drip coffee and steams milk.IF YOU WANT A CAPPUCINO MAKER DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE!!!!!!!That being said, it makes a good cup of American style coffee but nothing spectacular. But the name and advertising are very misleading. If I was evaluating a [...] coffee maker it would probably get 4 stars, but since I paid [...] -- on sale -- for a cappucino maker, I deducted two stars for being ripped off."
3,Great coffee -- poor durability,"I admit that I really love this machine. It makes great coffee and does a terrific job of frothing the milk. And who can beat the price? If you are thinking of purchasing the machine, however, you should know that getting replacement parts (which you will inevitably need) is very expensive. The frother itself breaks after a few months (I froth two tanks of milk a day). In order to replace this, you will have to purchase the entire milk tank, steam tubing, and frother. Mine has broken twice in the space of 12 months. In addition, I broke my carafe and found that it cost $...(plus shipping) to replace (the prices on the price list included with the product were out of date). Paying over a third of the purchase price to replace the carafe was a little much. Having said all this, there probably isn't a better value on the market for the price."
4,Great Steamer,This is a great Coffee/Cappuccino machine except for two problems. 1)No auto-shut off. This is a saftey feature many of us have come to depend on at times. 2) Replacement filters for the water filter are almost impossible to find.However the milk steamer more than makes up for it.
5,The Best I've Ever Had!!!!,"Not only is this coffee maker a nice looking piece of equipment, it is extremely easy to use. A little more expensive then your average coffee maker, the added feature of a cappuccino machine built right in makes it well worth the investment. It makes an excelent cup of coffee or cappuccino! Enjoy!"
1,Looks good but doesn't work!,"I purchased this machine earlier this year and it took over 45 minutes to brew one pot of coffee. I guessed that it was just a bad unit and that I should send it back to be replaced/repaired. I found out it takes four weeks to get the machine back assuming they don't have the parts on back order! Even though you spend $... on it they don't take any steps to ensure a good level of customer service. If you are considering buying this machine, hope that it works otherwise you won't be waking up to coffee in the morning for a while."
1,WHAT A MESS,"I DIDN'T PAY ENOUGH ATTENTION TO THE PEOPLE WHO SAID THIS MACHINE LEAKED. WELL... I ORDERED IT. WHEN I FILLED IT THE DOOR BELL RANG AND WHEN I GOT BACK THERE WAS WATER ALL OVER MY COUNTER AND FLOOR! SO I THOUGHT, O.K I'LL TRY AGAIN. SAME THING. THIS TIME I FILLED IT IN THE SINK. I TRIED EVERY WAY I COULD, BUT IT LEAKS. IF I PUSHED THE BREW RIGHT AWAY, IT ONLY LEAKED A SMALL AMOUNT. THE NEXT PROBLEM IS THE FOAM. NOT GREAT. AND, IF THE FOAM OVER FLOWS, IT GOES RIGHT ON THE COUNTER. THERE IS NOT A RESERVOIR TO CATCH IT."
5,What a Singer!,"I cannot add a lot to the other reviews, except to say that this is a great introduction to Mary's singing. It contains a few duets with Daniel O'Donnell, with whom she tours in the US and internationally, and those are some of their best duets together...my favorites at any rate. Whispering Hope is her personal favorite, and Somewhere Between is a stunning rendition, but where Mary really shines IMHO is on the breathtaking versions of Cliffs of Dooneen and Amazing Grace. Will give you 'goose bumps' to hear her sing those! And her voice is so versatile, I also love her rendition of More Than I can Say and Crazy [she rivals Patsy Cline here] I think this is good value for the great list of songs here. I don't think you can go wrong getting this. I'd give it TEN stars if I could!"
5,A necessary bland accompaniment,"My favorite cracker to serve with a fine cheese like Brie is table water crackers, particularly by Carr. The long box is filled with a single round of packaged crackers. Each cracker has a taste that is bland and subtly crisp.Carr's also offers a variety of its water crackers: bite sized, with cracked pepper (another favorite), golden, a mixed assortment, and, of course, wheat.So in review: a plate of water crackers, Brie slices, grapes (red or green), and a bottle of merlot. I love a red wine with my cheese and crackers. Sometimes a loaf of fresh French bread is great to smear a nicely mellowed brie over it, bite by bite."
5,A must for entertaining!,"I bought this urn recently to complement a West Bend urn I already owned so I could have urns for both decaf and regular coffee when I entertain. Now I wish I had two of the DeLonghi. The clear tube outside shows the water/coffee level, and the interior basket is marked so you don't have to measure the grounds before filling. Two lights, red and green, indicate when the coffee is perking and when it is ready for serving. Even unplugged after brewing, the coffee is kept hot for hours. Easy to clean and high-tech looking with its stainless steel and black exterior, this urn makes a great addition when entertaining large groups of people. (Perked coffee takes longer to brew than drip, so start the brewing a half hour or more before the coffee is needed; this urn brews quicker than does my West Bend, but it still takes time.)I highly recommend this urn. I don't think there is a better one on the market."
3,Needs More Detail,"I bought this book on the urging of a friend. I think that the information is really good but I don't feel that there's enough step by step information for the beginner. I do, however, like the great deal of helpful hints. I just wish that the technique section did not look like it was drawn on a very old computer. I find some of the techniques very hard to follow due to the lack of quality picts.I especially don't like the basket designs. The book does not have a detailed (close up) photograph of the finished product. After weaving, you can't see enough detail to compare your work to the author's (other weavers).I prefer Lyn Siler books. They have a great deal more detail of the finished product."
5,Great for Beginners,"This book covers everything from choosing your reed to dying. It also includes easy to follow directions for different weaving patterns, as well as directions for 20 different baskets. It doesn't have an color pictures, but the diagrams are clear and concise. For someone, such as myself, who has almost no knowledge of basket weaving, this book is a great addition to my library."
5,Karen Staley-Wildest Dreams cd,"I received the cd in the time frame predicted-it was in great shape. Karen Staley is a great artist. Karen is also first and foremost a Christian. I met her after a songwriters in the round in Nashville and she is a very ""down to earth person"" who enjoys talking to her fans. Great lady."
5,Lapco bigshot barrel for Tippman A5,"The stock barrel for the A5 is the one thing about this marker that is sub par. I upgraded with the 14"" Lapco barrel and the range and accuracy were like night and day. If you do not want to spend the money on the flatline barrel system for your A5. I highly recommend the Lapco model, it works great and has yet to chop a ball plus the bead finish matches the gun. Very cool!"
4,BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD FOR THIS ONE,"AT LONG LAST ,SAM COOKE HAS BEEN ACCORDED A BOX SET,WHICH HAS BEEN A LONG TIME COMING.MANY TRACKS MAKE THEIR DIGITAL DEBUT(TEENAGE SONATA)WHICH MAKES THIS AN ESSENTIAL.BUT THE ONE SONG THATS MISSING IS THE GREAT ""A CHANGE IS GONNA COME""HIS GREATEST RECORDING OF ALL TIME.ITS ALMOST AN INSULT TO HIS MANY FANS THAT THIS ONE DIDN'T MAKE THE CUT.MAYBE THE COMPILERS OF THIS BOXED SET SHOULD RE-EVALUATE ITS MERIT"
2,Not worth the price,"I know it's tempting to buy this, since there are so few black roses in the market today. But don't fall for this one!Although it seems really nice in the picture, it is of very low quality, the petals are not so tidy close, and the overall aspect screams ""Cheap!"".If you want nice black roses, keep looking. I know I am."
5,How fun!,Hi there! I can tell you one thing: This toy beats the blahs! (blahs mesns really bored!) The only bad thing is I have to share it with my lil' sis!
3,"The Cherokee, king of Indian Tribes of North America","Author of many books and articles on southeastern Indians, Theda Perdue is a well-known specialist of the history of the Cherokee Nation. Her book ""The Cherokee"" is written specifically for young adult readers. However, because it contains an extraordinary panel of beautiful photographs and because it summarizes very well the tribulations of probably the larger Indian Nation of North America, Perdue's book is a ""must"" for the people not well acquainted with the advancement of the Five Great Civilized Tribes of United States.Serge P. Noirsain, Belgian historian. Author of ""La flotte européenne de la Confédération sudiste"" and ""La Confédération sudiste, mythes et réalités""."
4,"Great playing, but Nimbus' echo-chamber sound distracts","There are some real gems on this album that are classic Copland in quality, but are probably unfamiliar to many. Alan Marks is a sensitive interpreter of these works. He is percussive when he should be, or rollicking, or tender and evocative. Listen to the 10 seconds of the Old American Songs, Long Time Ago. I cannot imagine it played more expressively. The Rodeo selections are pleasing -- I always like to hear another version of something that is well known.My only problem with this album is the way Nimbus recorded the piano. Nimbus claims it is a natural sound. I have quite a few Nimbus recordings -- they are adventuresome in their selections -- but I prefer hearing less echo and more of the subtle interplay of the notes coming right from the piano. I think the echo distracts from the sound, but that is just my opinion."
3,DOES NOT WORK WITH NEW MACBOOKS,"This adapter works fine for macbooks and other Apple laptops introduced before January 2009, but for the models introduced after that, it simply doesn't work. This is explicit in the Apple Store listing for the item but does not seem to have been listed here on Amazon. I purchased the adapter and now have to return it. It worked fine with my old Powerbook G4, but I want to view on my television Netflix 'watch it now' movies playing on my computer. The Netflix online viewer does not work on non-Intel macs like my powerbook."
1,Apple Video Adapter from GWTechparts thru Amazon,"It doesn't work when connected between iMac G5 (iSight) and TV composite video input, have tried all possible methods of getting something, screen on TV remains blank. TV works fine with DVD recorder connected to TV composite video input, but this adapter has no video output at all from my iMac. The adapter looks perfect, just doesn't work."
3,Great music/terrible recording,"Misa Flamenca is great music wise, but this recording does not do it justice. The guitar is barely audable, you have to turn your stereo all the way up and its just about there, the solo singer is the only one with volume when he comes in he's to loud compared to everything else. They have to remaster that album; the recording mix is just terrible for all this great music."
4,Divine,"Misa Flamenca received three standing ovations at Carnegie Hall, and Paco Pena is passionate, ethereal, and technically brilliant. I highly recommend this album."
1,The all new 7 day watch,Let me start by saying I own a Timex Ironman watch for work and have worn the same watch for 4 years now and the only thing i replaced was the band. Well I decide to get a new one and thank goodness i didnt throw the other one out. I'm currently deployed so the only good that came from the watch was it got here quick. Watch starts off fine then in a short 7 days the display starts flickering when i move my arm and then the Button to change between the dual times falls off so now i cant do a quick check to see what time it is in the states and when you change time zones as much as i do that is kind of important to you and finally on day seven of owning the watch its dead. Thanks Timex for showing that you dont care what kind of craftsmanship goes into your product!!!
2,Button trouble,"First, I like the features,size, and shape of the watch. However, the plastic buttons are not sturdy enough. I have broken the top two buttons on two watches. I am not really that hard on the watch. I am retired and just do yard work along with what every retiree does. ( a bunch of nothing??) Also, the whole in the strap holder doesn't always hold the strap from slipping out. But, I will probably order another (3) because it is easy to use and I already know how to use it."
4,Great watch,As a long distance runner I like a watch that's good to read during a race and has easy to use buttons.This watch has both and combines it with a nice memory for lap times.
3,It's not like my previous Ironman,I should have read the specs better. My old Ironman connected to my computer and offered so much more. I assumed this would do the same.
4,Gets the job done!,Comfortable watch that's easy to view. Used the count down timer to time my work out in the gymn and kept it on in the pool. Waterproof. At $30 its a great value. Exactly what I wanted.
4,Timex Sports watch review,Watches (got two) came in and we are using them to train for a half marathon. Very nice to have 30 lap capability for those trips to the track! I recommend for anyone serious about logging training.
4,Great!!,My husband likes it very much but think he will get the ironman one next time!!! But Timex watches last and he really is hard on his watches for everyday
5,Timex - Does take a beatting!,"I replaced an older Timex with this one and it has not failed me yet!I've dropped it into a pond, ran it over once and lost count count how many times times I have hit it on something, and yet it just keeps ticking. No cracks, scratches or other evidence of potential disaster.If your looking for a VERY good watch with a chronograph, 2 lap counters, an alarm, 12/24 hour clock, indiglo backlight or 2 time settings this is the one for you."
2,clumpsy strap,the strap is clumpsy. it has tab to lock the strap but difficult to remove at time of removal. the strap pin also does not come off easily. dont know why it does not change from am to pm option either.
3,"Good watch, Band not Replaceable","Solid little watch,I liked the older black on black style as it was more understated.BAND NOT REPLACEABLE.It's a soft plastic and they become brittle and fail in about a year.Usually at the retainer bandThey offer one, but attempting replacement will cause a decent,if not into madness, at least into serious chagrin.Consider it disposable.At this price that's OK."
4,Smaller dial than expected.,"This watch has all the capabilities advertised; however, I would prefer a watch with a larger dial. When running down the road, I only want to glance at my watch to determine my pace, not stare at it."
5,Great watch,Great watch at a great price. What more can you ask for $30? It's the quintessential Timex watch. It's simple and very functional.
5,Nice watch for lap swimming,I use this watch mostly for interval sets while swimming laps. I have bad eyes so I cannot see the pace clocks on the wall at my local pool. Stop watch works well and has a lot of lap splits available. It's a snug fit that prevents it from wobbling around on my wrist and also does not add much in the way of drag. Very happy with this purchase.
5,mens timex ironman watch,"I usually have a problem wearing watches. Not this watch. The watch face and band are fused together, so the hair on your wrists do not get caught or pulled. It's even comfortable to sleep with it on."
5,Great everyday watch,I purchased this watch to replace the 10+ year old ironman watch that was on it's 4th band and battery. So far it is comfortable to wear and works well. The larger display is welcome to my aging eyes. Hope it lasts as long as the other Timex Ironman.
3,Doesn't stay locked in place,"It's ok, but the strap does not stay locked in place, like my old one does. It keeps coming loose and the strap sticks out and catches on things."
3,watch,"Watch is ok but very few features. Unhappy at presentCan,t use the watch because band came apart & can't get it back on the watch."
5,Great watch....or the Greatest watch!?,"I've had mine for 4 years and love it. Yesterday I broke my first band. I'll sum up it's durability and reliability by stating that I hiked the entire Appalachian Trail with it (lived in the woods for 4 months), did 3 triathlons with it and ran 12 road races. Along with those major events it's served as a regular alarm clock, timepiece, and companion!If you don't have it...get one!I can find no negatives...although the Deet in some insect repellant I used wore off the grey paint around the bezel. I don't view that as a problem."
3,Great Watch Easy to Use - Band Does Not Last,I agree with other posters this is a great watch and very easy to use. Howerver when my band broke I brought it to the timex store and they replaced the band. The next morning when I went to put it on one of the bands fell off. As I was trying to put it back on the other one fell off. Apparently they had so much trouble replacing the band they broke both of the supports on the watch. Well I just carry it as an alarm clock now when I go on vacation...
2,"OK watch, battery not replaceable.","This is an OK watch. The battery lasted for years. But when the battery wears out, you can not replace it yourself. They have the watch rigged so you need special tools and expertise to replace it. Sorry, but that's a jerk thing to do, IMHO."
5,"great price, great features, great watch","I purchased this watch for my husband as a gift. He wanted a watch that would do military time, have indiglo(nightglow), a timer, and show the date. This watch has all those things and more! He loves it!!"
3,"good watch, bad service.","I bought total five different watches for gifts. four of them is in good conditions. one is an open or return item on which the time had been set correctly by someone and the protective plastic membrane which covers the dial was missed. the watches themselves are ok, I have had good experience with timex. the service from amazon is not good this time though otherwise they are excellent."
3,Review of a Gift,"I ordered this watch for my son, who actually requested it as a gift. He has told me that he is very satisfied with it and uses it all the time. The dial is easy to read and the watch has all the features he requires for his purposes."
1,Picture and Add are Misleading,"The watch itself is fine. I've had a Timex Ironman before and used it for running and swimming. This particular ad for the watch says ""Full-size"". Well it's about 3/4 the size of the Ironman watch I used to own. This one is too small. I prefer the larger size."
3,Reason why it's less expensive,"Great functionality from the watch, but the plastic strap is very stiff and uncomfortable. I used to have one of these back in the day and that wasn't the case. I suspect that these cheaper ones (~$30) are lemons that went bad on the manufacturing line and are trying to sell cheaply. I would suggest buying the normal priced ones (~$50) and get the comfortable strap."
2,Ladies watch ???,"Within the first hour the watch strap broke, had to pay to repair as i could not fix after hours of trying. The watch seems very small could it be a ladies watch???"
5,longevity,I've done several triathlons with this watch in addition to wearing it every day for 8 or so years. I just finally had to buy another after the battery was wearing down (harder to read the face) and the band was just starting to crack. I did use this watch every day in my profession. Timing patients in walks etc. Great durable for the money.
3,Great watch until...,"I have had this watch for probably about 2 years now and it has been great watch from day to day work as a firefighter/EMT to scuba diving to all kinds of dirty and rough activities that have put it through all kinds of abuse and it has done great. My problem with it is that this past weekend I was doing some dive training in a shallow lake (deepest part was 60 ft/about 20m) and the watch decided to flood. I contacted timex and they want me to go through a bunch of hoops that I don't have time for nor feel like dealing with, yet I'm finding myself buying another one of these same watches."
5,Patty is pure country,"Ahhh...Patty!! What a pure sounding country voice. One of the best. Every song on this album is a good song. Vince Gill lends his vocals (as background)to 5 of the songs which makes them extra special. If you are a Patty Loveless fan, but have yet to get any of her earlier albums, why not start with this 1988 one. It's an over looked gem. And worth every penny."
5,Some of her BEST work!,This purchase was made to replace this very same album. If not her best work it is inthe the top 2
4,Exuberant! Nice Stuff!,"This is a really nice exuberant natural sounding album. Good songs, really well produced and sung great! Love it!"
2,brewers hat,"okay so this was a Christmas gift. and i'm disappointed. i've gotten hats off amazon for awhile now and if you get the correct size then you have zero issues in general. so why would this one be different? its smaller. tight on his head leaving marks. i would of returned it but he said to me that its a little tight but its new and he will stretch it over time. but he never wears it, because its small and hes being nice lol. i think its because its a "" on the field alternate 59fifty cap, not just a regular 59fifty cap. if i were you and you really want it. get a half size bigger. other than that good price, good quailty and shipping was fast too."
2,Christmas Movie,"VHS tape was marked on and dirty. Even tho it said delivery date could be as late as Dec. 30th, I ordered this Christmas tape for gift on Dec. 7th and don't see why it had to arrive the week after Christmas. Was not satisfied with this buyer and will not purchase from them in the future."
1,Traumatized me as a child,"I'm 33, and the memory of how devastated I was as a child when the mama donkey died is STILL with me. I would cry and cry. And they played it EVERY year, so it got to the point that I'd know when the part about the mama donkey dying was coming up, and I'd leave the room to go sit alone in my room and cry. This is a horrible movie to play for a child, anytime, much less during the holidays."
1,Who needs this at Christmas,"Dealing with the death of someone's mother at Christmas? Get real!The previous reviewers are NOT overplaying their part when they state that the mother's death scene made them cry.Certainly, this film is as well made as are the others of the series, but I'll never forget how this movie ripped me apart.No one should have to deal with such depressing issues during the already cheerless winter months. Even the joy of Christmas can only make up for so much.If my children never see this video, they will be better off for it."
4,Reply to 'Who needs it at Christmas',"I agree that the scene dealing with Nestor's Mother's death is very emotional-I cried my eyes out also, a very heartbreaking scene with the song lyrics and Nestor's tears. However Disney has used the same type of scenes in their very successful movies for years.(Anyone remember Bambi's Mother's unfortunate rendevous with hunters? that scene was every bit as distressing. There have been many others also.)I think it helps children to learn empathy for others when they see this type of movie, however I also think that some children who become excessively upset shouldn't watch-My daughter when she was 6-7 would cry literaly for days afterward whenever she would think of it-I put it away for years-She's 15 now and right behind me on the couch, tears rolling. Every parent should determine their child's sensitivity to these type of poignant scenes. If the child will be traumatized save it until he or she is older. It's a great movie and a very nice message."
1,Dumb,"We watched this one time and donated it. There are so many other good Christmas movies to watch, that this wasn't worth it to us."
2,Chris mispells afew words,"Chris mispells a few words, like sayihg ""install"" instead of ""instill"" He also misuses quotation marks."
1,what a joke?,there's nothing interesting about a singer who had a good voice but just gets by now.and who slept with the Boss.who does average Material at best and that's a reach.she is a tacky turkey.
2,Not the best information,"This book is almost an exact replica of the previous book by Chris Nickson ""Mariah Carey- her story"". There was very little new information. Plus, most of his research is just magazine articles that most die-hard fans (like me) already own. There weren't any exclusive pictures, no actual quotes from Mariah about the book, nothing that made it any more spectacular than a scrapbook made by a fan (which would have probably been more interesting). This book is better for someone who is not a huge fan, but would like to learn some things about her and her life. I think many fans who have been loyal from day one could have gotten together to write a better book."
3,mariah carey,If you have read his first book about mariah it is basically the same until the last few pages. But still a great book for dedicated Mariah fans like me!
1,book is very damaged,this book was badly used and damaged and was listed as new. There are stains all over the inside pages.
4,Big Apple Becky,"I loved this book! Such fun to read...I laughed and laughed! I kept reading snippets of it aloud to my husband! Great book to read after a hard day at work...good bedtime reading..Becky, although silly and irresponsible, is a very endearing character...you just want her to get on the right track and be happy...and Luke is the type of guy who Becky should be with...opposites attract! Buy this book!"
5,I can't wait for the next one!,I just loved the continuation of the relationship between Luke and Bex. He seemed to attain a more human quality in this novel.Another reason this book was so great is that we all know that in the real world money problems aren't solved by getting a better paying job. This book shows that Bex has a lot more to do to solve her accessive shopping habits... and it's a riot reading about how she attempts to do it!
5,How ya feelin? Shop Shop Shop!,"Shopping takes on a whole new meaning. Sophie Kinsella has done what most of us would deem as impossible. She's taken a would-be shallow greedy girl, and made her into quite a loving and selfless person. Ok, she does tend to leave Prada sales and Barney's with her VISA card peeling plastic, but she deserves a little credit. She is quite selfless and helps her best friend with her aspiring frame-making, deals with jealous brides, an over-eager boyfriend, and lets not forget bills. She's a financial advisor, yet can't advise herself. Her career as a writer leaves her in shambles, so she goes about her credit dilemma the way any girl would, she uses her GOd-given wits. This novel is an extraordinarily well written, funny, and easy to relate to, must for any man, woman or child who loves fashion, passion, or just plain humor."
5,Shopaholic Takes Manhattan Rocks!,"I really liked this book. I have also read Confessions of a Shopaholic and Shopaholic Ties the Knot and I love them! If you like funny books, you should definitly read this one!"
3,Too much like the first book,"I will say that these books are funny, but they are all the same and the girl never learns her lesson, which gets annoying. Very much like a soap opera. There is a good story line and you do get drawn in, but I get annoyed with her getting back into the same troubles and turning out just like the first book in the end. I would like to see who she is going to marry as Breandon has been her man, but I just don't like that it always is the same. I won't be reading any more in the series."
1,"dreadful, just like the first",i hated the first shopaholic book but got both from the library at the same time. i struggled through the first and didn't even get halfway through this load of crap. the main character is still unlikable and the situations are ridiculous... i consider myself quite the shopper but couldn't find humor in her irresponsible behavior. i've moved on to the billy chaka series instead and i LOVE tokyo suckerpunch. if you want a fun book with a little more substance and less ridiculousness i highly recommend it!!
3,"Funny, entertaining, but too much fluff","Shopaholic Takes Manhattan is a cute little breeze of a book that entertains lightly and is best read while gorging on an extra large box of bon-bons. The main character, Becky Bloomwood is so ditzy and irresponsible it is hard to feature her in the role of financial journalist that she is cast. We are entreated to a variety of shopping extravaganzas that are quite vicariously delightful, but this book would have been far more satisfying had the author made some sort of stab at the underlying cause of Becky's addictions."
5,Becky is back and at it again!,"Once again, Becky's spending is out of control! With hard-working businessman/boyfriend Luke at her side (sometimes), Becky takes on Manhattan! But will all the stores on Fifth Avenue do in Becky's bank account? And will her new bank manager give Becky the extra overdraft she desires? A girl simply can't enjoy herself on a night out on the town without an expensive Vera Wang cocktail dress, can she?!? This story is even better than the original with hilarious mishaps and unpredictable twists. Laugh till you cry, but don't put it down till your finished...and then start the third installment!"
4,I'm starting to really enjoy Becky!,"When I first started to read Confessions of a Shopaholic, I thought to myself - what's all the hype? The book dragged a bit, but the last few chapters really made me get on the Shopaholic bandwagon. I had to find out what happened next between Luke & Becky. This book was so much better than the first in my opinion. Still typical Becky and I admit, I too felt frustrated with her at times, but then you just can't help to like her and love what she has with Luke."
3,Not a Shopaholic,"I haven't read Confessions of a Shopaholic, but the local library I went to didn't have it, so I took this book in spite of everything. I thought it was going to be a fun, light reading.Well, it started out okay. I remember that I went reading the first few chapters straight and even laughed. After awhile, however, it gets tiring. It's hard to feel sympathy toward Becky, the main character, because she's such a spendthrift and is so shallow on top of it. Seems like she has nothing else on her mind but shop, shop, and shop. I don't know how she got her problem fixed in the first book, but undoubtedly she didn't learn any lesson.In any case, I eventually finished the book, but it's not like I was excited about it. I don't think I'm gonna read the rest of the trilogy. :("
5,Complete Fun! Better than the first shopaholic book.,"This book should go on the ""great, fun, chick-book"" list. It's funny, well written, has all the elements of a fun romantic comedy. It is so NOT Oprah's depressed-style of chick book - it's the fun type. I read it in one evening and enjoyed it so much. I laughed out loud at the humourous lines, and really chuckled at some of the circumstances. It's a bit silly (who really has SUCH terrible habits?) at times but the creative scenarios dreamed up by the main character give her the tools to whip herself into shape - and you into hysterics."
3,It's Ok,"I found myself laughing a few times, but I didn't enjoy it as much as the first one. Sure, Becky gets herself in to some funny predicaments again, and I did enjoy her spending spree in New York, but there was something missing from this one. Maybe I just thought it was a bit too far-fetched."
3,you know what to expect!,"this book has the same plot with its prequel, confessions of a shopaholic!shopping problems - blown out of control - crisis - picking up the pieces - getting it together - with luke brandon thrown at the end!still, it's an easy and quick read.. through becky bloomwood's irrepressible shopping habit tended to get irritating at times!"
2,A Real Disappointment,"I really, really loved the original book. I'm totally a shopaholic, and I could totally relate to Becky's plight. It was honestly the funniest book I've ever read. Needless to say I couldn't wait to read this sequel, my hopes were so high. However, I didn't enjoy this book at all. Becky seems to have lost a lot of her spunk, and honestly her character just depressed me in this sequel. Funny moments in this book were few and far between......I don't know. It wasn't horribly bad, it was just sort of pointless. I felt as though this book was a waste of my time."
1,too much stupidity,"I thought I would enjoy this book since I did enjoy the first one. However, I've decided to stop reading this book halfway through. Rebecca's stupidity is just overwhelming and annoying in this book. The author seems to have gone overboard in this one. The stupidity isn't cute or funny but just downright annoying."
4,"If you liked Confessions, you'll like this one.",It was a cute book. No better or no worse than Confessions of a Shopaholic.
4,An amusing read...,"If your looking for laughs, this is the book for you. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Becky's antics were very amusing and Luke's reactions were even funnier. Miss Kinsella did a fabulous job with this sequel. However, if your looking for something intellectually stimulating, don't waste your time. This book was written for shopaholics like myself."
4,A Great Continuation of the Original...,"Shopaholic takes Manhattan is again such a fun read and is very addictive. I don't recommend reading it before bedtime because if you're like me, you'll never end up going to sleep. Compared to the original novel (Confessions of a Shopaholic), this one is more serious, has more of a plot, but seems to be less funny.If you've already read the first one, then this is must read. Because you've got to find out what happens next. Now that I've finished this one, I can't wait to find out what happens in Shopaholic Ties the Knot."
4,"Becky is at it AGAIN, just in NY","Becky returns in the second installment of the Shopoholic series. And it's a good follow up to the hilarious book that started it all. Becky and Luke move to NY where she has a whole new city to conquer! She gets an amazing job as a personal shopper at an exclusive Manhattan shop and loves everything, including her new friends and life in NY. Follow Becky as she continues her shopping sprees (this time w/ mysterious sample sales) and just enjoy the ride."
4,Shopaholic Takes Manhattan is Perfect Beach Book,"I enjoyed the first book, ""Confessions of a Shopaholic,"" very much indeed, even though it sort of dissolved into silliness at the end. That didn't matter; it was the character, not the plot, who made the book. This sequel is even better. Obviously, we're not talking great literature here, but not all books can (or should!) be great literature. This is the perfect book to grab for funny, well-written, light fiction. Parts of it will have you laughing out loud. I'm not even going to pass my copy along; I think it's quite likely that I'll read it again someday!"
4,Guilty Pleasure,"Becky is a big fat liar, can't control herself and a world class shopper. She's even worse than in the first book and I enjoyed every page of it. If she has a relapse, I'd love to read about it again."
5,Becky Bloomwood is back!,"I was so happy to see this sequel to Confession of a Shopoholic!Becky Bloomwood is truly a kindred spirit! I've missed her wonderous shopping sprees and ever so brilliant reasonings with her bankers. I was delighted to see how Becky dealth with the splendor of New York City shops. This book is even better than the first. Don't make the mistake of thinking this is just another ""British-girl"" book. Becky Bloomwood is truly someone special!"
5,Great pleasure reading!,"I took this book to the beach and was totally enthralled with it for two days. I couldn't put it down and couldn't wait to get back to it when I was forced to take a break.It is about a television financial analyst that is a shopaholic and can't stop shopping. She spends and spends and avoids paying her bills. This gets her in hot water. She goes to NYC for a vacation with her boyfriend and spends her money there, too. Her life ""blows up"" when she is exposed for her habit.It is a great light read, that makes you want to cheer for the characters. I think it was a great and ""proper"" ending for the character. It wasn't too long or too short. It was the proper length.I can't really see any downsides to this book."
3,shopaholic takes manhattan,"""Shopaholic Takes Manhattan"" would have been great as a standalone, but, having already read & loved ""Confessions of a Shopaholic,"" I was disappointed in the sequel. The plot in this book is virtually the same but with a different setting. Becky has learned nothing about managing her money since ""Confessions."" Again, she gets into money trouble, is completely unaware that she is spending too much, & she lies to all of her friends & Luke until it's too late. Again, everything blows up in her face, & she is forced to dig her way out of the mess she has made. Sound familiar?I felt sorry for her in ""Confessions,"" and I was really rooting for her to come out on top. Becky seemed to have learned her lesson & became a better person for it. ""Shopaholic Takes Manhattan"" puts Becky right back at square one, as though she has had no personal growth since the first book. It's a little hard to root for her this time around."
5,Review for Shopaholic Takes Manhattan,"I liked this book because Becky ended up doing what she truly loves at the end. You get to meet Luke's mother. She's a joy. Becky does hit rock bottom before getting back on her feet, but it's totally worth it."
1,Unfunny!,"Let me first start by saying, I have a sense of humor. The joke was on me for believing the great reviews I read before purchasing this novel--not funny. I did not connect with any of the characters. I begin reading, then stopped...I picked up the book again and was bored to tears. I want my money back!!!"
1,Nothing like the first!,"I hate say how much this second novel let me down. The first ""shopaholic"", I truly enjoyed, perfect light hearted fun, and great cottage reading. Somewhat of a ""shopaholic"" myself, I found the first book to be hilariously enlightening. The sequel though, I found terribly predictable, boring, and the only thing that forced myself to finish it was the hope of a glimpse of fun to reveal itself, unfortunatley, I made it to end feeling it to be nothing more than a waste of my time. Wish I felt differently, I love an easy, fun read once in a while."
5,Great Read,"Ok, I waited for this book to be out. I read Confessions of a Shopaholic and loved this book. It follows the first book but enough for the ones who read to follow but not to confuse people who have not read the previous one. ...."
2,Get a hold of yourself girl!,"This book, honestly, just annoys me. This woman, Becky, goes out and spends all her money on clothes, and then realizes she is broke, no wait, in debt. Shes supposed to be a financial expert. And then we're supposed to feel bad for her when she loses her job, boyfriend etc.? Its your fault Rebecca! Its supposed to be funny, but its just sad a 26 year old women would ruin her life by buying to many clothes. Dont you have any self control? Get a hold of yourself. I would not recommend this book."
2,Not impressed!,"The first Shopaholic book was hilarious and kept me entertained up until the last page, but this second book is pathetic. More of the EXACT same story as before. . . there's no progress with Becky. She's still totally irresponsible and her STUPID lies are downright frustrating! This repetitive tale becomes dull very fast.I'm not a chick lit follower, but thought I'd try out a few books. After TWO of these brainless shopaholic books, I've had my fill!"
4,Continue with the adventures of Becky Bloomwood,"This book makes an excellent companion to the first one about Becky Bloomwood, Confessions of a Shopaholic. Becky continues her outrageous shopping habits, which I could identify with on some levels. One of my favorites is when she spends a ridiculous amount of money in a stationery shop, including buying a thank-you card addressed to a tennis instructor. ""Because I'm planning to have some tennis lessons next summer, and I'll want to thank my instructor, won't I?""Americans will be able to relate to the places and brands Becky shops for in Manhattan better than they could with her London botiques in the first book. Her adventures at sample sales are absolutely terrific.The first two books in the Shopaholic series are the best, and the Becky character gets very tiresome in the follow-on novels. These two are gems that I would recommend to any chick lit lover or someone looking for a light and funny read."
3,Becky's in need of a 12 step program!,"Okay, I know this is a ""fun"" book, the humour is tongue-in-cheek and over the top, and I indeed did laugh out loud in several places. However, I often felt that I was reading through a psychaitrist's case study, I mean this girl is in need of some serious intervention. When I read ""Confessions of a Shopaholic"", I thought Becky was in need of some professional help then, now the poor thing seems downright certifiable. While Becky's antics are fun to read about, they must be done in conjunction with a total dispensation of belief. A life lived like hers would be anything but funny! That said, this is a very quick, cute little book that you can polish off in a couple hours. I know the next in the series pertains to Becky's marraige, I can only imagine ""A Shopaholic Does Therapy"" can't be far behind."
3,Rebecca's starting to get on my nerves....,"I loved the first book, but during the course of this second installment, Rebecca simply started to bother me. She just did some of the stupidest things! I really started to dislike her and longed for the end just to get away from her for a bit. By the end, she had, of course, straightened her life out (again), so I warmed back up to her, but I really didn't like it nearly as well as the other one."
5,Becky is back!!!,"I was so happy to read more about Becky and to continue with the funny and captivating story line of the Shopaholic series.Once again, Kinsella does not disappoint. She follows Becky as she moves to Manhattan with Luke, struggles with those damn tendencies to shop, avoids her bills, loses her job, and still makes her way in the world.The author really managed to keep Becky consistent from the first novel to this one and to make us love Becky all over again.Bravo for a wonderful repeat performance!"
5,More Becky Bloomwood Hilarity!,"I loved this book as much as its predecessor, ""Confessions of a Shopaholic"". We think Becky had finally gotten her act together at the end of the first book, but NOOOOOOO. How could we have been so wrong? This time she's in Manhattan, a shopper's version of Mecca. My one and only reservation with this book is the character of Luke. With all his millions, couldn't he help Becky out a little when he finds out about her financial mess? C'mon, Luke, you're supposed to be in love! Aside from his slightly harsh attitude at times, it all works out in the end. I really like the character of Suze - she's a friend in a million! Once again, Sophie Kinsella has written a really funny, engrossing book. It took me no time at all to finish this one - I couldn't put it down - and now I'm in the middle of the third ""Shopaholic"" book. Wonderful reading, very worth the time!"
5,A fun book.,"Becky Bloomwood knows she is on top of the world, and it just can't get any better. Now she is on UK television, giving financial advice. But her boyfriend, Luke Brandon, wants to move to the Big Apple to start a branch of his company there. Becky can't wait to go, and soon they are on the next plane to NYC. New opportunities open up, just as their romance fires up too. Read to find out what happens in this next installment by Sophie Kinsella. You won't be able to put it down."
5,Very Entertaining!,"I absolutely enjoyed this book! I am a stay at home mom of a three year old and a 10 month old and I was able to finish this book in about three days. It is a very entertaining book and a fast read. The character is very loveable, she keeps you wanting to come back for more."
4,Fun Chick-Lit What A Concept!!!,"Becky Bloomwood is Great! This was a fun story with great characters. Becky is a bit spacey but fun, and not at all malicious. You really can't help but like her and isn't that what's important when you read a book? Likable characters? This is chick-lit at it's finest. This is without a doubt a light fun read and Becky's ups and downs are not only funny but also at times realistically scary. I don't have a thing about shoes but put me in a Laura Ashley store and watch out!!!Ms. Kinsella has a winner here and I can hardly wait to read the first in this series nor can I wait to see Becky tie the knot! If you have been shopping around for entertaining ""Chick-lit"" but have found the offering slim and less then entertaining pick up this book you are guaranteed some laugh out loud moments as well as an appreciation for the air head."
5,"better, best, good","If you're reading the Shopaholic series, this is the best of the lot. You should read them in order to appreciate all of the inuendos. This is the second in the series and is the best of the three published to this point. Confessions of a Shopaholic is in second place with Shopaholic Ties the Knot coming in third. Looking forward to Shopaholic and Sister, due out in September."
3,A bit much...,"I enjoyed Confessions of a Shopaholic so I was really looking forward to reading the follow-up. It was certainly a quick and easy read, but some of the predicaments that Becky got herself into during the first half of the book were really just too much. Why are we supposed to feel sorry for her? She struck me as the kind of person you would be constantly annoyed with if you knew her in real life.From the middle to the end of the book, when Becky actually started dealing with her mess, I felt the book picked up. It showed that Becky wasn't just a flake, but that she was just a normal girl with a problem. And the nice, tidy happy ending didn't hurt..."
2,Not as good as the first one,"After reading the first ""Shopaholic"" book, I quickly picked up the this one. Although it provided entertainment on an otherwise boring flight, the book failed to meet my expectations. Was I reading the same story rewritten? Is there to be no character development in the series? I enjoy fluff as well as the next person, but there has to be some creative imput. Suze, Becky's best friend, seems to have been replaced by someone unfamiliar. Try borrowing from a friend or the library."
3,Concept has grown a bit tiresome,"Okay, I have to admit that I enjoyed Sophie Kinsella's first novel in the Shopaholic series, but the idea has definitely grown tiresome in this novel. True; I did read the book in about two days. It is a very easy book to read, probably best to read poolside on vacation. Becky Bloomwood ends up in Manahattan and further exploits her spending problems in the Big Apple. However, as lighthearted as it is, it gets extremely repetitive. Just about every situation and adventure that Becky Bloomwood gets in is completely predictable. It's almost as if the author doesn't understand that the readers have an ounce of intelligence in them. Overall, this was a cute book, and totally easy to read. Just don't expect to be more than just slightly amused."
2,Another version of Confessions of a Shopaholic,"The subsequent books in the Shopaholic series are rehashes of the first one, ""Confessions of a Shopaholic."" I felt that Kinsella was throwing around brand names for the hell of it, or just because she was thinking about where she'd go to spend her royalties. Becky constantly gets herself into the same mess over and over (I stopped reading the books after ""Shopaholic Ties the Knot"") and I found her annoying because she never learns her lesson. In each book, Kinsella makes Becky look like a consequence-blind moron until the last chapter of the book, where she has a major revelation and manages to save her dignity, only to lose it all again at the start of the next book."
3,Has she leanred anything?,"So Becky Bloomwood is back! Thanks in part to Luke, she has a fabulous chance at getting her dream job in NYC. Of course we can all predict what happens. Becky spends too much, Becky lies, friends save the day, and so on. I had a real problem feeling at all sorry for Becky and her mishaps, since she has become quite the financial fool, as well as outright liar. I didn't 'hate' this book, but i expected much more from Kinsella. Sure becky is a likable woman, but I hope the 3rd novel isn't as frustrating or fluffy."
2,Annoying Becky gets bailed out...again!,"The first time it was funny, the second time it was annoying. I was really disappointed by this sequel. I really enjoyed the first book, so I was really looking forward to reading the second. Unfortunately, Becky is so annoying and so stupid in this one that when I reread the first book after finishing ""Manhattan"", I found I liked it less. Not only does Becky not learn, but she lies constantly, and comes up with excuses and justifications that wouldn't satisfy your best friend, let alone your bank manager. The 'Cinderella' ending at the end made me want to throw the book across the room. I hope the third one is better!"
4,Laugh out loud funny!!,"It was my turn this month to pick the next book club selection and I chose this. We had read the first one last year. It is a nice diversion from some of the more serious pieces of literature we read.I've only read the first two of the series about Rebecca Bloomwood, an obsessed shopper so much that she overlooks her debt problems and just keeps hitting those great sales, and I plan to read the entire series.I laughed a lot reading this book. It is light reading, and her writing is very good for the genre of ""chick lit"".For anyone who just wants a quick easy yet fun read, the series about Rebecca and her debt, is a great choice. She seems to come of age a bit in each one as well, however, her debt doesn't seem to change.Worth a good laugh!!!"
1,Buyer Beware,I purchased my Cappuccino Machine in January of 2002; enjoyed the cappuccino until frother broke in September. After two months of phone calls and emails to customer service and various service centers - not one person was able to tell me what part I needed to purchase. I finally ordered a milk tank assembly unit in November which as of this date I have not received.My advise is not to buy any Delonghi product as per my experience their product is not durable since the frother broke within nine months of only moderate use. Also their customer service is terrible. I'm finally just going to junk this machine. Don't waste your money!
1,Beware,"Four months after I purchased this coffee maker it quit working. I delivered it to the designated service shop where is has been languishing for two months. When I spoke to the service rep. at DeLonghi today, she told me they had lost the replacement part and would have to start all over again. She didn't know how much longer it would take, wouldn't send me another coffee maker, and wouldn't make a refund. Let the buyer beware!"
1,Works great till it breaks.,"I purchased this cappuccino machine in April and it quit working in September. It has been in the repair shop for 12 days. Although I was told it would take a week for them to return it to me when I took it in, I was told it hadn't even been looked at when I called for a status report after 12 days. Beware."
1,The worst coffeemaker I've had at any price,"It was at the upper end of my budget. Problems started pretty soon. I will only discuss regular coffee making here.. Here we go: coffee is not hot enough, water drips off the machine continuously, the handle for the water container broke almost immediately, it doesn't have an auto-off feature!, at one point the LCD display freaked out and to top it off: today the machine simply refused to switch on manually so it went to the garbage bin!I will NEVER buy any DeLonghi product again. You have a limited budget? Get a simple Braun or Hamilton Beach machine. You have more money? Get the real stuff: a Saeco machine. I hesitated because of the price but if I had known... Don't make the same mistake I did."
4,"Great Coffee, Great Features","I was a little hesitant to purchase this machine as I've had disappointing experience with DeLonghi products in the past, plus the price is on the steep side for what is essentially a coffee maker. But I went ahead and purchased it. It really makes an awesome cup of coffee and the milk frothing is amazing and works far better than expected. The only downside is that this product doesn't seem to have been designed for US/Canadian markets with 60 cycle electricity as the clock and timer run so fast as to be unusable. So if you can live with that, this seems to be a great product so far."
2,"OK machine, Horrible customer service","The original CC100 I purchased leaked badly, and I had to drive it to the authorized service center 3 hours away (there are 3 repair facilities in my entire state). They could not repair the unit and had to ship it back to DeLonghi for a replacement.It took DeLonghi a total of 4 months to get me a correct replacement. Twice they sent CC80 models by mistake (similar to the CC100 but without a timer). Their phone operators do not return phone calls and don't seem to care when you have problems. Apparently if a defective product is sent back, their policy is to take about 10 weeks to ship another unit.The coffee maker itself is quite good, the frother works well and it has all the features I was looking for. But if you have a problem with it you might as well throw it away. I would suggest strongly not to buy anything from DeLonghi."
3,"GREAT ... for 2 months, then fairly useless","I LOVED this coffee maker for the first couple of months (even though the claim for enough froth for ten cups is quite a stretch if you drink coffe in anything but those teeny little demitasse cups). After two months the water simply stopped moving from the chamber into the filter to make coffee. Their customer service department, while very nice, couldn't offer any help other than a local repair shop ... which wants a significant minimum charge to even take a look. So now I have a very large and very expensive milk frother ... a really GREAT milk frother, but no coffee."
2,A book for Christians only,"This book definitely takes a religious perspective on the issue of abortion. As someone who is not a Christian, I found much of the advice to go contrary to my own religious beliefs about life and conception. If you are a Christian person who has been through an abortion, this book would probably be helpful to you as you recover. For me, many of the suggestions about thoughts and activities for healing just did not fit the situation. The book, like many others on this subject, also does not do much for women like me who needed a therapeutic abortion due to medical reasons. I am still waiting for someone to write a book that deals with the pain of having to abort a wanted pregnancy."
1,Never arrived,"This seems like a nifty device, but the one sent to us by Independent at Home (via Amazon) was defective--the pincers had not been assembled properly--and despite repeated promises from the vendor (Independent at Home), I still have not received a replacement (it's been over a month). So you might want to buy one, but not from this vendor."
5,Save Your Clothing!,"This is one of the best items that I have bought to use while throwing clay! This one little apron has saved me a lot of money by just wearing them while I worked with clay. If you make only one more purchase make sure this is the item that you buy!I really love this apron and I wear my apron all the time when I throw or just stand around and mix, roll out or even hand build any clay project I'm working on."
1,Apron needs work,In a nutshell here is my impression of this apron....The canvas material is very soft and in my opinionwill not hold up over time. The material reminds me more of something a dish towel would be made of only heavier.I do not think of this as canvas. The very first time I put this on the rivet that holds the ties together and keeps the strapsheld together pulled right through the material as it was installed in only one layer. This is a very poorly conceived itemand the quality is executed poorly as well. I will look forward to wearing this item out so I can dispose of it.
2,Sizes?,"This apron, with its pocket space and wonderful tying style, would have been a home run... if it hadn't stopped at about my upper thigh. I'm 6,3 and so far have ran into generic aprons that usually end at about my upper shins. This apron however is incredibly short. with the top of the apron at mid sternum the bottom ended about the height of short shorts. way too small. I would not recommend this to anyone over.... 5'4""? maybe smaller. wonderful product, its just a shame there is no way I, or any taller person, can use it."
4,Smells delicious!,"The chocolate cake Spazzstick smells exactly like chocolate cake, which I love. The caffeine was undetectable though. I also loved how silky smooth it felt going onto my lips!"
5,Great pasta colander,"I wish I had bought the slightly smaller one, nevertheless this is perfect for draining pasta without losing the precious pasta water needed to add to sauces."
4,Good product but needs different handle.,The handle is a little awkward. It would be more comfortable to use if the handle was rounded instead of flat. I bought it for scooping ice out of horses water troughs and love that it won't break like plastic strainers.
3,waterproof dog boots handy but not well made,"Boots were the easiest to put on my dog that I have ever purchased. Did not hold up well. The toe seam came out of one of the boots the second time they were worn. The other three are coming loose at the seams, I will have to patch them all. They were worn in -40 wind chill weather and they seemed to help my dog's feet adequately. For ease and warmth I'd give them a thumbs up, for quality a thumbs down."
5,Not For Newbies,A person has to know and have achieved all of the note sounds before this book can be used.
5,Creative outlet,"Because of my adult onset allergies and Asthma I could no longer do crafts that involve using paint so I bought this book. I can now utilize my creative talents and not worry about the scents from the supplies (glues, paint, etc) I use to craft with."
3,requires experience,While most of this book is self-explanatory if you've had some experience with paper engineering there are parts that require a more thorough understanding and a lot of just figuring it out for yourself ... perhaps I'm a bit dim but I would have liked more detailed information on how to put the more involved ones together. Put on your thinking cap and be ready with your patience. The results are dramatic.
5,A TREASURE TO OWN,"Any book by Masahiro Chatani is a treasure for one who is interested in origamic architecture and beautiful paper.Many of the master's patterns are far too complicated for beginners, but this little book is easy to use and has beautiful patterns for pop-up cards. It can be used by anyone who has basic cutting and folding skills along with a bit of patience. I have made most of the cards in the book and my friends love receiving them.From wikipedia.com:""Masahiro Chatani was a Japanese architect (certified, first class) and professor considered to be the creator of origamic architecture.[5] From its development until his death in 2008, he was widely acknowledged to be the world's foremost origamic architect."""
3,Very advanced,I own a few DWTS dance DVD's as well as the Julianne Hough ones and while I am not a pro dancer I feel that I am at a higher level than the novice dancer. However I did this DVD for the first time the other day and I was very dissapointed. It was very hard to follow along in most casesEdyta started off fine but then she ended up going way to fast and did not explain alot of the steps that well. I was very impressed with another DVD that had Kym in it and am able to do that dance but this one she did same thing was lost part way through. I felt that out of all the dances Chelsie was the best and easiest to follow.I will give it another try but it is not fun doing a DVD that you get frustrated doing
1,Terrible,"This video is horrible. Totally unispiring. Boring. Boring. Boring. The music has a low volume and it did not put me in the mood to dance (let alone exercise). The ""Hustle and Pop"" segment is a really bad version of 80's aerobics. I'm really surprised the producers put their names on this."
1,I'm sure I burned more calories from frustration,"Even when I have trouble keeping up with a cardio dvd at first, I practice it over and over and usually am able to ""get"" it in time. I did this one once, and knew right away I would have to toss it. I would say only buy it if you are very well coordinated with great agility. The first section is too slow, the second is the most ""cardio"" but I couldn't do any of them accurately enough for it to be a good workout."
2,Don't buy it if you don't have dance class experience,"If you don't have dance class experience you will be absolutely lost. You have to remember lots of moves and do them very quickly. I think I could watch this 30 times and still not get it all down. Buy a Jazzercise DVD instead. Their Latin and Burlesque DVDs are much better and fun, plus they give options for people at varying fitness levels."
1,waste of my time.,"I never do dance videos but went out dancing and had a great workout so thought - YAY, I should workout to dance and it will be fun. Went along and got this and OMG, not onlydo I want to never eat again after watching a sexy girl dancing but I feel retarded and discouraged. I was literally falling to keep up - I am not out of shape, I just had no idea how anybody but a professional could keep up with the fast changing moves. Don't waste your money."
2,Way too advanced....,"I bought this in a store before I read the reviews..bad move. I found it very difficult to follow. If you are not experienced in ballroom dancing, I would not recommend this DVD. The instruction is minimal with them demonstrating it once and then you practice once slowly and then its all at full speed. I really felt that they needed to break the routines down a bit more to let you master the moves.I will give it another shot since I cant return it, but since I will be following the instructional video for a really long time, it cant count for my daily workout. The only plus to the video is that you have the option to do the workout dances without instruction which makes it a sustained cardio workout. It takes out all the parts where you are just watching them demo the moves. But, to get to that level I have lots of work to do!"
2,Not for Beginners!!!!,"This dvd would be great if it has a tutorial section, but it has nothing!!! Also a ""rear"" view would be helpful for those learning how to dance... I am sure I could get a good workout if I knew what I was doing... It is so frustrating! So many dance/workout videos lack instruction!!! So far the ballet conditioning videos have worked for me... not trying to learn to dance, just go through the conditioning part to get toned..."
2,Hard to learn the dance moves,"I bought this DVD at costco cause I had started a new diet and thought this would be a fun addition. I should have researched this video before just buying it. It is very hard to follow. I thought it was me at first, but my sister tried to do it with me and she could not follow it either. They dont really teach you the moves and it progresses too fast for you to really get the moves down packed.I haven't tried other workout DVDs so I cant really compare. However, I know from my first experience that this workout DVD is not that great and there has got to be better videos out there."
3,Starts off well... goes own hill,"I consider myself to be fairly enlightened when it comes to dance (took classes and cheered). However, this DVD was not broken down well AT ALL! They all start okay with giving an 8 count and doing a few times and then taking from the top, but then it's almost as if they are afraid they are running out of time so they start doing 2-3 at a time w/o hardly any review. I felt like they were trying to do a whole dance routine that takes the celebrities a week to learn. I own Julianne's as well as SYTYCD (which is fast paced too)and I love them! The routines in this DVD are fun, but will take A LOT of practice... Chelsie's routine was the most fun overall."
2,4 disc order is mssing a disc.,"This is a 4 disc set. Unfortunately, it is missing disc 2. When I placed the order, there was no indication that any of the discs were misssing. I am disappointed with Amazon that it does not insist on full disclosure by its vendors. This set was rated very good with no other disclosures of any kind."
5,worthwhile,"I really liked this book! I'm not Mormon, I don't have any kids, I don't have much on the surface in common with the author. I ran across the book in the library thinking - this can't be for real, no one has 12 kids and lives to tell the tale! The author is wise and funny and really insightful. She's got a lot of insight into womanhood and into life in general. Lots of good quotes too."
5,One of my favorite books ever.,"I am a stay at home mom of three. This book was given as a gift to me ten years ago. I laughed and cried as I read the entire book in a day. I highlighted sections and would re-read often. After a couple of moves, I discovered I had lost this book and was thrilled to find this out-of-print book on Amazon! This author (mother of 13 children) has a way of writing and phrasing that is so poetic and clever and REAL! It is reminiscent of Maya Angelou. I love Maya. And I love Geraldeen. They write as if you are their good friend and they are letting you into their world. Both sage women that I would love to sit at their knees and absorb their pearls of wisdom."
5,Mini thrill!,"This was a single cassette tape with a thin paper sleeve, such a convenient format for those of us who have only cassette players with our old car radios. I thought it would have to be a joke or spoof of some kind, but nothing of the sort. It runs a little under one hour and is a short story with all the elemtns of James Bond thriller: the ruthless, upper class ethics of an English spy organization, the villainy of the KGB, the Berlin Wall era with historical accuracy, the minute details of James Bond's snacks, his reading habits, and his taste in girls, a slight plot twist, the thrill of the kill and the guilty conscience --it's all there, nostalgically reminding one of the good old -sixties in England. And the nice English reader has a versatile English public(=boarding) school accent which he varies just slightly for each speaker. What a new generation of listener/readers would think of it I have no idea - but they'd be unlikely to listen to it on a cassette player, wouldn't they?"
1,If I could rate this lower I would. Absolutely the worst,"Absolutely the worst toaster oven I have ever owned, and I have had several brands over the years. I bought it expecting a high quality item that would last for years. Instead we found the bread and bagel took ages to toast, and then was toasted unevenly. The oven seemed to overheat. And the dials were a complete annoyance as they were constantly being left on the wrong setting (toast/bake). Not to mention the damned ticking.The coup de grace was when the top element melted down while toasting and completely fell to pieces on top of an English muffin. I won't be replacing it with another DeLonghi product, believe me."
5,"Perfect, no frills","We have had a very long-lived and well-used Alfredo Toaster. We like the simple design, intuitive controls and absence of silly embellishments. This toaster is straight-forward and consistent. We hope that it is as bomb-proof and durable as the last one."
4,Another Quality Bosch Product,It will take about 30 seconds to bore a small hole with this bit. It might take a bit longer through solid concrete but that's stating the obvious. This bit was not worthy of 5 stars though. There is a small pin which holds the centering bit in place. To remove this tiny piny requires the removal of a rubber ring and this pin is hard to notice when it falls out. I also worry about the rubber ring wearing out after time. Seems like a design flaw for something so expensive. But the bit itself work great so far.
3,So-so book,"Out of all the books I read for my digital media degree, this one was by far the best- and that isn't saying much. This author as well as other are making it all entirely too complicated. Straightforward writing is all that is needed and this book missed it by about 1/2 a mile."
4,Donna's Review,"Content is excellent. Too bad more of us couldn't be more expressive. The only real downside is that she and/or the publisher couldn't have been bothered proofreading the manuscript (for both grammar and spelling, primarily the former) for missed and duplicative words."
5,Excellent,"I have read alot of transgendered bios , This one was the true language of the heart .Sharing all her pain , but giving hope at the same time.Knowing that there had to be light at the end of tunnel even if at some times it seemed like a train .I know first had also how hard this road is , but as Donna says in her book, we all need each other with help along the paths in our lives .anyone could benifit from this book. God Bless ."
4,Wrapped in Blue: A journey of discovery,"We live in a society that urges us to be true to ourselves, find the true self and live accordingly. Donna Rose has personifed that the self does matter in her riveting memoir. Not only did I enjoy the honest, humor and openess of her narrative, I soon realized that this is not just a book about a transgender, it is about about human nature. I applaud Donna's courage. From her picture she could have chosen just to hide her identity and live a ""normal"" life. Instead she has chosen to share her story and encourage all of us, to thine own self be true."
5,Following in you Footsteps,I am Transgendered and in transition. I found the book to be a valuable educational tool for me. But beyond that it is a story of courage beyond all reason. I cried when she cried and I was lonely when she was lonely. It is a riveting yet compassionate story of 4 years of David/Donna's life in which a frustrated male tosses all odds to the wind and despite intiial misgivings transforms into a beautiful woman. Her explicit details of her day to day transition is must reading for anyone contemplating a gender change. I applaude her for her honesty and integrity. Bravo. Donna
4,Good but needed more,"I love the premise of the book, but after finishing it I didn't feel like the book really equipped me with much to raise my 2 young sons to be wonderful husbands. At least the title of the book did help to remind me that I am raising potential future husbands and I should be thinking of ways to encourage them to be God-fearing, loving, and understanding. There were a few practical ideas like how we should ask our sons how someone felt in a situation to get them used to thinking about feelings. This was an easy book to read and I liked the idea, but overall I wish there had been more practical ideas."
3,Typical advice for good mothers,"This book offers much of the same advice ""concerned"" mothers most likely are doing already. Although it offers some fresh ideas, I thought much of the information was made up of ordinary tasks and advice moms do daily. It is useful as a tool or a reminder of things we need to be instilling in our sons so that they may grow up to be men. This book is worth reading."
2,Not very well written,I purchased the kindle edition which did not configure well. Many typos and formatting issues.The chapters were redundant. I did glean a few ideas but not worth the price.
2,Easily the worst Fresh Aire installment,"From 1974- 1990, the first seven Fresh Aire albums rarely faltered, but after a ten year wait Fresh Aire VIII is unwelcome. The tracks rage from a positive ""unmemorable"" to downright ""bland"" but there isn't a single standout track on the cd. I think that there are a few reasons behind this: Davis's overproduction and his attempt to capture his work from over 10 years ago. The overly grand orchestrations play along bareboned synthesized (and otherwise) percussion licks that don't quite come together. It lacks the charm, emotion and completion that Fresh Aire I-VII for the most part possessed. Not a horrible disc, just altogether unforgettable."
2,Infinitely boring,"Fresh Aire VIII is based on the concept of infinity. All of the songs are (loosely) written with this in mind. One big problem with this album is that it is largely recycling old Mannheim Steamroller material. The opening Greek Suite is a ripoff of the beginning of Fresh Aire VI. ""The Big Bang"" is mostly a spacey sound effect fest. ""Leonardo"" is good, but sounds very much like previous Fresh Aire material. ""Fractals"" is insanely repetitive and annoying, apparently trying to show us the mathematical concept of fractals. ""The Circle of Love"" isn't bad, but ""The Steamroller"", with it's ho-hum melody and irritating saxes, is quite bad. ""The Heart and the Feather"" is one of the best songs on the album. Overall, it contains way too many simplistic melodies. It's a shame that Chip Davis couldn't close the Fresh Aire series gracefully."
2,Letdown Steamroller Fan,"Just heard MS in concert at Interlochen. The first half was comprised of cuts from previous Fresh Aire's. It was great and one could tell the huge crowd grooved to it.Then, this new release of Infinity. The DVD was played, and it was not well received. Philosophy and math and love and on and on and on and on, sideways done eights. Too much, and not the Steamroller stuff one is used to nor what was heard in the first concert half.Many of the audience left early. My impression of this new effort. Going in new direction that I can't go with. I will not buy this, nor recommend it. Davis expressed that over 1,000 people involved in its production and over $5 million dollars. My input is that likely $450 million was wasted."
2,Mannheim disappoints...for the first time,"The first time I heard this album, I didn't know what to think. It grew on me gradually, and then as I listened to it more I realized that for the first time, I didn't like a Mannheim Steamroller album. (I am a huge fan.) There are too many special sound effects and not enough good music. Even good tracks like The Circle, Waterfall, and Leonardo have too many sound effects that get in the way. The Big Bang and Fractals are too insubstantial for my tastes. I think overall I liked about half the tracks on this CD, but with some reservations apart from The Steamroller. Definitely not for everyone."
2,Disappointed,"I was so thrilled about getting this CD and unfortunetly didn't enjoy it at all. Selling it after one listen - I'm sure many will love it, but it's not for me, I'll stick with the other albums in the collection."
2,Hard to tell it was Mannheim,"This album sounds less like mannheim steamroller and more like other contemporary new age compilations. A few tracks do stand out, but overall I was a little dissapointed. The repetition and the blandness of the tunes made me feel like I was in a department store. Still, I don't feel cheated, the few tracks that retained mannhiem's distinctive style made the cd worth buying"
3,Women and Songs V1,"I found the next volume (Women and Songs 2) in this series to be better than this one, but this is still a good choice with a good selection of artists and songs. All in all a great series of CD's."
5,ultra zymn review,great transaction with the vendor as well as with amazon. Product is exactly as described and I use it every day.
4,This was so sweet!,"This book had a more original them than the others, and it was really good! It was kind of dissapointing that the Phantom and Sam weren't close anymore though. It was so sweet how all these horses that were about to be killed found homes. I wish faith were real so I could raise her!"
1,This ink clogs up printer head.,"I used this ink for my Epson C-80 printer. This ink clogged up the nozzle. I could use only 10 % of ink. After the nozzle was clogged up, I had to use a Q-tip with Alcohol to clean the nozzles. Auto clean didn't resolve the problem. I don't recommend this ink."
1,T032120 Black Cartridge - Replacement,I purchased two of the above replacement cartridges. They came in a different package which I did not think anything of at the time. As of this writing I needed to replace my cartridge with the one(s) purchase and found that the printer does not recognized either these cartridges that I purchased. I now have to run to another store and purchase the correct cartridges that WILL be recognized to complete my printing before my meeting.
5,"After listening to this cd, Five has become my favorite band",Five is a very good band. I wish I would see more of 5 in America though. And I wish they would release new 5 cd's and songs in America as well as England. I want to get my hands on their new single FIRST!
2,its complicated !,Thsi text is too complicated. I wish I had bought a better book. But unfortunately there are not many good books on this topic.
1,Good Cold Coffee.,"This machine makes a decent tasting pot of coffee if you like to pour it out of a Thermos, disappointingly lukewarm and cold within seconds. A waste of money. I'm going to to buy a different one."
2,TOO SMALL (and not HOT enough),Got this maker for CHRISTMAS and found it too small of a carafe. The coffee does not get hot enough and it is not 8 cups it is more like 3-4 cups!! NOT worth it >>> got a Cuisinart DCC-1200 Brew Central Coffeemaker>>LOVE THAT ONE!!!
2,Disappointing,"Constantly overflowing with coffee all over the counter. Good coffee, but can't risk the spill over anymore."
1,"Good coffee, terrible coffee maker","While this pot made good coffee for awhile, the pot itself is a piece of garbage. We spend a fair amount of money for it, and all of the problems the other reviews experienced we ran into. The No. 2 filters are too small and the No. 4's are too large. If the coffee is too fine, the water spilled all over the place. Over time the lid began to leak, and the coffee doesn't stay hot."
3,Works fine - but what is a TIMER?,"To me a Timer is something that is set to go off at a specific time. In this product's case when I bought this coffee grinder I believed that it could be set to produce fresh grounds at a certain time in the morning. This is not true for this product. What they mean by Timer - is that you select how many tablespoons you want & this number is the ""tablespoon timer"" amount that is ground for you. I call this slightly deceptive. Otherwise, the grinder works fine."
1,it grinds,"It does a good job of grinding the beans. We use a drip cone filter coffee maker and we set the grind to that setting. The grind is very fine and the grounds cling to everything - the cup, the spoon, and the lid of the grind catcher - making a mess when I open it up to pour the ground coffee into the coffee maker. I haven't been able to determine which settings match to the amount of ground coffee that I like to put into the coffee maker and the catcher isn't condusive to scooping the coffee out with a scoop.I guess I don't have enough experience with all the different types of coffee grinders to give this a fair rating, but I don't care for it - it's going back - I gave it one star."
2,Drip coffee ok - espresso I don't think so.,"I have not had good luck with this model for espresso fineness grounds. I took it back 2 times to see if it was just the unit, but I still cound not get the grounds to be fine enough.Don't know what to recommend for the same price range though."
4,A good machine; some care required,"We grind 2.6 ounces of beans for 8 cups of coffee, and we use a dark Italian roast, which tends to be oily. Our first machine worked well for a time, then the motor siezed. Our second machine is working well, but we have to clean out the exit from the griner periodically. We recommend that you only grind what you need for a pot of coffee, and let the machine run for a few moments after the grinding has finished. This seems to reduce the tendency to jam.At the price this is an excellent machine."
1,Not any better than a blade grinder,"I purchased this because I need a burr grinder for my Pavoni espresso machine. It does not grind fine enough for any pump or piston espresso machines. It is fine if you are just brewing in a automatic coffee machine or french press. But if that is what you are brewing, then why would you need a burr grinder? I wouldn't recommend this machine."
2,Grinds well...at first,"I really liked this grinder to begin with, but after a year or two, it is now incapable of grinding finely enough - not one for the long-term."
3,beans don't always make it to the burrs...,"This grinder tends to let beans get ""stuck"" above the burrs, not allowing the full amount of beans to be ground. Unless you are right there while grinding, and can give it a hit on the side to knock the beans down, your coffee will end up very weak. I have wasted lots of expensive beans using this grinder. I would not purchase another."
2,Messy to use and not durable,"I would have to rate this coffee mill as acceptable but not great. Like many mills, it is messy to use and transferring the ground coffee to the coffee maker is not a snap. If you play around with it, you can figure out how to minimize the mess, but unfortunately mine gave up the ghost and stopped grinding after a year or two of NOT very heavy use. I just threw it away and will not buy the same one again"
1,Performance not what I expected or hoped for,"I really dislike this device. Finest setting not fine enough for good espresso. Grind not consistent texture. Noisy. Difficult to clean without a brush. Timer cannot be overridden when coffee has finished (cannot be turned off by turning the dial counter-clockwise). Static charge frequently sprays grounds all over the place when opening cover after grinding. It does grind the coffee, but my old, tried-and-true Braun rotary does a much better job, is faster, and much more pleasant to use."
3,Good machine -- Lousy service from DeLonghi,"Although slow, it does a good job, but hope that you don't need, say, a replacement for the plastic ground-coffee holder. The U.S. warehouse doesn't stock it, will possibly replace the whole machine in a month to six weeks, and you can drink tea while waiting."
2,OK Grinder.. but not for espresso,"I purchased this grinder and was forced to send it back. It worked fine, however it couldn't grind the beans fine enough for an espresso maker. I ended up returning it.So coffee grinder yes... espresso grinder NO"
1,Is there a 0 star?,I have been making coffee for 45 years. In 1948 the Melitta Co. in germany came out with the first cone coffee filter. That just shows you how far back I go. The DeLonghi Deluxe Burr Coffee Grinder with Timer............is by far the worst Coffee grinder I have ever used. For drip coffee it has to grind the coffee fine enough for good taste. This coffee grinder does not.I rest my case.
1,"Dead, one month after warranty expired","Another perfect example of planned obsolesence. I'm still using a blender and a toaster theat my grandmother bought 50 years ago, but this thing [stopped working] after 13 months. Yeah, I used it daily, but it's not like I'm running a coffee house, I made one pot of coffee a day. [...] you expect a product to last longer than 13 months. DON""T BUY THIS!!!"
4,Easy to Use,"This was an impulse buy, and I'm glad I purchased it!I'd been using the Krups grinder for years, and the first thing I noticed about the DeLonghi was it was quieter than the Krups - something to appreciate early in the morning when others are still sleeping. The timer and grind setting features work well and eliminate the guesswork about how long to grind. We alternate between our drip coffeemaker and espresso machine and it's just a twist to change grind settings.The only negatives I've found in the month I've owned it is there is no way to clean the grinding mechanism and the bean dispenser doesn't detach. My daughter drinks flavored coffees which I don't like and I worry that the flavors of different coffees might get mixed up and detract from the taste. So far that hasn't happened.I found the price was not much more than standard grinders and was well worth it for all the added features and benefits."
3,Grinding Quality,"I am disappointed in the ground coffee result. In my estimation the ""finest"" setting does not result in a truly Espresso texture. Additionally there is usually a dust the sticks to the catch container, that is toooo fine. I bought the burr grinder so I can use one of those gold metal strainers in my coffee maker. The 'dust' will go through that filter and my espresso sieve and the result is muddy coffee. I wish I still have my Braun coffee mill."
1,not helpful at all.,"the book is not helpful at all. it is very confusing. i tried to study, but it is very confusing."
3,More Becky Bloomwood antics,"It's not Becky Bloomwood's fault that I have grown slightly bored with 'chick-lit'. Because she is somehow adorable. And this latest adventure is a funny, light, easy and entertaining read. Becky is getting married, and finally has an excuse to buy those lovely wedding magazines. And while Becky is fantazising about dresses and shoes, her soon-to-be mother in law, Luke's non-likeable mother and Becky's own homely mum, starts preparing two very different weddings. Soon Becky is caught in the middle of it all, and what should have been the happiest time of her life, becomes a nightmare of lies, confusion and trying not to disappoint anyone. It is not as sad as it sounds. It's funny. And Becky, being Becky, is bound to find a way out of her self-created mess. Actaully, this is the best shopaholic in the series, and recommendable as the perfect beach-book."
4,Entertaining As Always,"Becky Bloomwood is finally getting married. How much trouble could she possibly get into now? More than ever before!As always, Becky has trouble saying no, no to her pushy and autocratic future mother-in-law, no to family friends who all want to plan her wedding and of course no to more than one wedding dress. Why only have one when you can have six or seven?? The end result will keep you entertained right up to Becky's wedding day.I have been highly entertained by the adventures of Becky Bloomwood over the past few years and look forward to more by this author with her new series due out next year. Well done!"
5,BRILLIANCE!,"Sophie Kinsella did it again! She wowed me again and again! This installment of the Shopaholics series is just plain brilliant! There's no other word I would choose to describe it. Becky Bloomwood is at it again, and this time she's got much, MUCH more than she's bargained for. Usually shopping comes so easily to our dear Becky, but this time it's worse. How can you choose just one wedding dress? And how can you choose where you want to be married? The twists and turns Becky gets herself into is plain ridiculous that it's ridonkulous. If you're up for some light, funny (no, not just funny, absolutely hilarious) reading, I recommend this book (well, along with the first two as well)! Happy reading all!"
2,Silly as it gets!,"This book is about as silly as it gets! If you are looking for a light read, this book is perfect, as are the previous 2 books in the series.Becky is a total airhead, with nothing much going on between her ears besides thoughts of shopping. She seems even more flaky than she was in the prior books.Luke seems to have undergone a personality change. No longer does he seem to have passion, and frankly I wondered what Becky saw in him.Suze returns, and is one plus of this book. She is level headed when Becky is off dreaming, and in my favorite scene she calls Becky selfish, which is dead on in my opinion.I'm not sure where this series could go from here. Becky would be a terrible mother. Could you ever imagine her giving up her extravagant shopping sprees to save for her child's college fund?"
1,Silly in a bad way,"This was my first ""Shopaholic"" book, and I was sorely disappointed. While the plot is cute and the writing is fine, the main character is such an absolute nimwit that I found myself groaning at her stupidity. For me, a 27-year-old who can't voice her opinions about her own wedding, hasn't bothered to ask her fiance if he wants children, can't keep her credit card in her wallet, and continuously lies to her fiance and her parents isn't a funny, lovable heroine, but a frustrating nincompoop. Sorry, but Rebecca, and this book, are losers."
1,How could anyone have published this?,"It is astonishing and discouraging that this truly terrible book even got published. But, it also seems not to have been edited. (...) The plot is boring and absurd. The main character, however, is detestable. (...)Fortunately, England has also given us Shakespeare, Tennyson, and Swinburne."
3,I want to slap Becky!,"The first one was great, the second one had its moments, the joke is wearing too thin on this one. However, I did enjoy the portrayal of the evil mother-in-law. I know a few people like that so I thought it was very realistically done for a change."
4,Shopaholic gets tied in knots,"I picked up this book off the rack at Gatwick and read all the way home to Pa. This was my first encounter with Ms. Becky Bloomwood and I thoroughly enjoyed it.Having recently planned a wedding I could relate to a lot of the things that happened. From trying her mother's wedding dress to trying to decide on one from dozens.Becky's attempts to avoid problems, with lies, and please everyone especially herself backfire in a big way. She has two weddings planned on the same day on two different continents. How will this all work out?If you need some light reading and a laugh try Shopaholic Ties the Knot.Now I'm gooing to go backwords through the series and find out how it all got started."
5,Keep Shopaholic Coming!,"I have read all three of the Shopoholic books, and enjoyed them. They are very entertaining and make me feel a whole lot better about my bad habits, such as shopping, and trying to please everyone. ""Shopaholic Ties the Knot"" came at the perfect time. I am planning my own wedding. As stressful as my wedding planning is, it will never reach the depths that Becky Bloomwood has gotten herself into. Very enjoyable, and I hope there will be more books about Becky."
3,Funny but not Kinsella's best,"I always love the Becky Bloomwood novels, but I consistently run into the same problem: they lose steam somewhere around the middle of the novel. This one was no different.In this particular novel, Becky finds herself engaged to Luke Brandon, her sexy, successful boyfriend. Before long, her soon-to-be mother-in-law has hired a wedding planner in glamorous New York City, and unbeknownst to Becky, her mother has already begun to plan an Oxshott wedding. Caught in a laughably precarious wedding drama, Becky manages to keep the whole farce a secret from the person who matters most: Luke. But in this novel, Kinsella manages to reveal more about Luke's personality than she has in the past.This was an enjoyable read, but I still didn't find it as enjoyable as the original Confessions of a Shopaholic."
5,You'll want to run out a plan a wedding!,"If only we could have this much drama in our lives. Confessions, Takes Manhattan and Ties the Knot makes you laugh, makes you cry and makes you want to go shopping, but watch your money. Just incase you have to plan two weddings."
2,Totally Absurd but a quick read,"I liked Confessions of a Shopaholic and I like the main character Becky, but this book goes a little too far into la la land for any of it to be real. In C of a S, I could follow Becky's reasoning and obsessive shopping mentality. Throw that into wedding planning and the author seemed to be making up completely unrealistic situations. I couldn't identify with Becky anymore and kept turning the page wanting it to end. And after everything, of course it ends perfectly. It was a quick read, but it lost that fun and identifiable-ness that the original book possessed."
3,For die-hard Shopaholic fans only,"The latest entry in the hilarious Becky Bloomwood (aka the Shopaholic) was somewhat of a disappointment. I had eagerly awaited this novel in which Becky marries her sweetheart Luke Brandon, but unfortunatley was let down. Shopaholic Ties the Knot lacks the laugh out loud comedic situations that were in Confessions of a Shopaholic and Shopaholic Takes Manhattan. Beckyk has matured and is more in control of her finances, and the reader experiences less of her eccentric personality. The story centers too much on newer characters like Elinor (Luke's mother) and Danny the upstairs neighbor than characters we've known since the beginning like Luke and Suze. The rather boring plot centers around Becky's difficulty in deciding to get married in New York or England (yes, it's as dull as it sounds) Although this book lacks the charm of the first 2 novels, it will provide a great easy reading."
4,Always a great read,I always enjoy the shopaholic series and never can put it down until I finish. Definitely a series you can recommend for anyone.
4,English humor is interesting,Easy to read keeps the reader captivated. Sometimes an entertaining story is needed with all the negative things going on in this world. This author hits it.
4,"More of the same, which is a good thing!","If you're already a fan of the Shopaholic series, you'll find much to love about Ties the Knot. Even if you've never read any of the previous novels, it's easy to get immersed right away in the fun-filled, cute world that Kinsella has made.If you've been reading the series since the first book, this one is a great finale! I hope this isn't the last one though, because I want the series to keep on going :-)"
4,Becky is getting MARRIED!,If you're a fan of the shopoholic series and of Luke and Becky's relationship this is the pay off. Luke finally pops the question. But now Becky must decide what to do. Will she have a swanky Manhattan wedding paid and designed by her evil mother-in law to be or a wholesome country wedding back in London w/ her parents? Follow her as she tries to keep both sets of parents happy all the while continuing to keep her shopping addiction in check.
3,Redeems herself. Finally.,"Just when I get utterly put out with the selfishness and self- involvement of main character, Shopaholic diva, Becky Bloomwood, Becky suddenly and unexpectedly makes an incredible move into maturity and redeems herself."
4,infuriatingly funny,"As I love all the shopaholic, I thought with out a doubt that would be a great book. But, when I started reading this I was annoyed. Becky is engaged and happy but both set of parents are making her a wedding and all I wanted to do was to yell at Becky that she should get some confidence and yell at both parents and do what she dreams of. When you read you read it you will find out what ends up happening. Yes, I said you should read this book because as infuriating as it may be Sophie Kinsella still knows what she's doing or I wouldn't have stayed up all night and day just to find if Becky's confidence kicks in. I recommend this to everyone and hope you get as deeply into this book as I have."
3,Humorous...,"I like this one more than the second book (Shopaholic takes Manhattan). It's a funny, hilarious, relaxing read. However, if you're looking for great literature, this is not the kind of book. It's a great choice for long-haul flights - it definitely keeps you entertained!"
5,The Shopaholic Series is a Must Read for All Shopaholics,"The entire series is a must read. They are funny and interesting. They keep you interest all the way through. I read each book in 2 days. The main character Becky is such a funny girl. All Shopaholics will relate to Becky so well. I got the first and the third book as soon as they came out in the U.S., but I bought the second as soon as it came out in London, I just couldn't wait to read it. This is a must read for anyone who likes to shop, hopes to fall in love, or just loves to read."
3,Was something...,"Wow! This book sure was SOMETHING. Although I did enjoyed Becky in two previous novels, I found it hard to respect her personality in this novel. Becky isn't much of a heroine. Her inability to grow up, speak up, and take responsibility was down right frustrating. So frustrating was this novel that at times I DID wish for a doomed wedding. I'm glad this is fictional, because if everyone were to be like the characters in this novel and succeed, one need only imagine the chaos.The saddest part of all was that Becky didn't really have a wedding of her own, both weddings were done to please others.All in all, I give this 3 stars because I must admit some parts were amusing and, I've read worse."
5,THIS IS SOOO ME !!,"I just received the book yesterday and I am already finished. I could not put it down. I found myself awake early this morning b/c I couldn't wait to see what would happen next. It seems as though Becky and I are on the same page. Just when the first book, Confessions of a Shopoholic came out-- she and I were just alike--it was like reading about me. Then the second, Shopoholic Takes Manhattan, was the same--just like me. And now that I am getting married in Sept. I find Becky and I doing the same things. What am entertaining, funny book. I can't wait--who knows what's next, SHOPOHOLIC HAS A BABY ?? I would reccomend this to anyone who is a shopoholic. To anyone who feels a sense of accomplishment and relied when she carrys that brand new shopping bag.Great, Great, Book !!!"
2,disappointing fluff,"I agree with ""disappointed"". I wasn't looking for Jane Austen (just a light summer read) but this fluffy novel is the literary equivalent of Legally Blonde 4. The writing style is engaging but the character and her puerile machinations quickly grow tiresome. What exactly is so lovable about a case of arrested development? Bridget Jones has a lot to answer for."
2,Third Time Not a Charm!,"I must begin by telling the reader that I absolutely adore the first two installments in the Shopaholic trilogy. With that said, It was a terrible disappointment to read this book. There is no character development, nor plot. I found myself dozing off several times. Due to the ten plus dollars I paid, I made myself finish this book. C'mon, Kinsella spends the entire book having the heroine ponder one question.I think Kinsella could have done a lot with this book given the premise--Can you imagine what a shopaholic would be like planning her own wedding? Instead, the author leaves all the planning to secondary characters. If you must read this book, because you feel invested in the Shopaholic series, borrow it from a friend--this book is not a keeper."
4,Happy with order,Book was in good condition as stated. Product was shipped quickly after ordering. I would use them again
2,Not her best.... compared to Part 1 & 2,"I have kept up with the series and I loved ""Confessions Of A Shopaholic"" 1 & 2, I think the storyline was intense in the first two parts, but this ""Ties The Knot"" was not very good. Deciding between two weddings is not the biggest problem out there... But as a true shopaholic follower, I will read the 4th book ""has a baby"" and see if the storyline picks up there... sorry fans, just being honest:)"
2,A little tired of Becky,"I was very excited to read this book, since I loved the first two, and I'm fascinated by anthing that has to do with a wedding. The first book was good, I enjoyed the second one even more, but the third one was difficult for me to get through. I really just can't stand Becky's deliemmas anymore. It makes it hard to read the books before it that have a ""feel good"" ending where she learns her lesson, for her to just come back and be even more selfish in the next book. The question that this book put in my mind is would she marry Luke if he was not a millionaire, because obviously shopping means more to her than the people around her.If I come across the fourth one for really cheap I will buy it, but not for full price."
2,Starting To Be Annoyed By Becky...,"I'm not sure why I keep reading these books, but I guess it's because I've read the first two so I'll keep reading the rest of the books. In the first book, I really found it amusing. I was a little annoyed by the fact that Becky couldn't stop spending, but then again that's why she is called a Shopaholic. In the second book, I felt more of the same it was just magniifed more. Now in the third book, I'm just down right annoyed by Becky Bloomwood. In this book, she wasn't going on crazy shopping sprees, just planning two different weddings because she was afraid to tell each person and because I feel she's really selfish. Still, I read the book because I wanted to see how she could get herself out of another situation. I will say that I love her friends Suze and Danny, her client Laurel and her husband Luke. Maybe that's why I keep reading. I will read the next book, but I'm sure I'll be just as annoyed when I'm done."
2,Good writing but annoying character,"I picked this up at the airport after having read The Undomestic Goddess. Sophie is a great writer and I started out enjoying the book but felt more and more frustrated as I read to the end. I couldn't help but notice that both story lines Undomestic and Shopaholic are based on women who carry deception to extremes. I became annoyed that the main character Becky didn't have a backbone to be truthful when necessary, she likes to sweep things under the carpet. It was only when others found out about her deception that she eventually came clean. In the end her friend Suze aptly described her as being selfish and that's just an understatement. Overall an unsatisfying book, there are better ways to spend a rainy day than read this series."
2,Shopaholic ties a slip knot,"This was my first and last Shopahilic book I have read. The plot was dim. The only reason I read the book all the way to the end is because I was hopping something bad would happen to Becky. I really hope other Shopahilic book aren't' dim as this one, but I am not reading any other Shopahilic books to find out."
2,Dissappointing,"I loved both of the previous Shopaholic books, but this one left me feeling disappointed. The idea that she had two weddings on the same weekend was just dumb. This was not how I expected the book to end at all and although sometimes it's a good thing when a book takes an unexpected turn, this time it just made me think dumb, dumb, dumb. I also thought Luke came off as a driveling idiot instead of the dashing, strong character he was before."
3,its not great but i like it,its probably my least favorite in the series. it still has its good parts and worth reading with the others but this one kind of drags on without much action
3,slooooow shipping,"The book is in good condition, but I think it took far too long to be shipped out to me. I am accustomed to receiving packages within a few days to one week. Ten days is too long. Another book I ordered simultaneously from another vendor arrived in six days. I was thrilled with that order, and I've almost finished reading that book."
1,How could this book possibly have been published?,"I find it amazing and discouraging that this truly poor book would be received well by anyone. The author seems not to know how to construct a sentence. The grammar is terrible. Words are summarily invented. Moreover, the main character is a self-centered, stupid, spendthrift who enjoys burdening others with the consequences of her unfettered appetites. Luckily, England has also given us Shakespeare and Swinburne,"
4,Shopaholic Does It Again,"Becky Bloomwood is back. This time though, she's getting married. This is a great afternoon or beach read. Luke (from previous books) has finally proposed and Becky has accepted. Snooty Elinor (Luke's mum) takes over and plans Becky's entire wedding, unfortunately so does Becky's mum. Worst thing is, Becky can't decide which wedding she wants..the extravagant wedding at the Plaza in New York or and backyard wedding in England. This book will leave you guessing the entire time."
4,Two Weddings Which One To Choose ~,"I enjoyed this book so much more then the second one in the series, I love all the characters in here I especially loved Danny, he is so funny he cracks me up, I wish he would get his own story you know how he is trying to make it in the fashion, business he is just as crazy as Becky. I loved Suze, I would love her for my best friend. In the Two books I must say I didn't care to much for Luke, but in Shopaholic Ties The Knot he showed more of his good side and the more I read about him the more I started liking me. I was so sad to see this book end only because I know that this is the last one in the series, we can only wish that Sophie Kinsella has a brain storm and comes up with another one.Happy Reading Lisa"
2,reader,"i loved and adored the first two shopaholic books. however, in shopaholic ties the knot, i seriously began to hate becky. i got the sense that as a 27 year old, she didnt know how to handle her problems AT ALL. she kept putting them off as if she was in highschool. she seems to me as a person who's scared of confrontation AND can't handle her own ground. and i can't believe she got away with not having her wedding in new york. she just easily slips out of problems...and we all know thats not how the real world works."
1,a painful read,"I had to force myself to finish this book. I found the story and the characters weak and could not relate to (or laugh at) the main character Becky in any way. I found her painfully indecisive, weak, naive, childish, and just plain annoying. The story and events were so unrealistic, and the solution to Becky's neverending dilemma wasn't exactly rocket science. I especially hated the numerous moments where Becky finally decided to confess her problem to someone, and then something else came between. So repetitive and frustrating, and the outcome was neither satisfying nor worth the wait. First book I read by this author, and sorry to say the last."
3,If you don't mind a little stress,"This is the third read in the Shopaholic series and the main character Becky sure has a way of getting into some pretty deep trouble. This novel was breezy yet also touched on some really sensitive subjects for Luke (the main character's fiance). The issue through this novel is that she ends up planning two weddings for the same day, on different sides of the world. Which will she choose is the question? As the novel goes on, the read gets more and more stressful because instead of fixing the problem, she adds more into the mix. Always funny, yet a tad frustrating, I still enjoyed this read as I am a fan of the series and will continue to finish it."
4,"A fun book, but not my favorite in the Shopaholic series","I really have found the Shopaholic series to be quite fun and enjoyable. The character Becky Bloomwood is fabulous, witty, quite sweet, but a bit insecure with herself. As with all of the Sophie Kinsella books, it's fun and I found myself laughing out loud in some parts. I must confess that I found this book a little less enjoyable than the first two, but still quite fun.I know Becky is quirky and loves to shop, and that's what I love about her, but you think she would have learned something by now. I am amazed with how many lies she tells and is unable to tell the truth. I found myself saying to myself, ""Come on, how could anyone let it get this far"", and frustrated as a result. Becky breezes through seemingly without consequences. I don't like the message that sends.While some of my comments seems a bit negative/constructive, I still really enjoyed this book. I haven't found anything by Sophie Kinsella that I haven't enjoyed."
3,Becky's Bloom Fading,"I'm giving this a three because as ridiculous as this book was, I still love Becky Bloomwood. However, the whole two-wedding storyline was not only absurd but ceased to be fun or even coherent - especially the Plaza wedding.Danny the neighbor isn't an appealing character and I missed Suze and Tarquin. Luke makes random appearances in his exasperated, British way. I wish Kinsella would spend more time on Bex and Luke's relationship instead of her endless lying and bizarre spending. It's getting old."
4,Good Company,I listened to this book on CD during a long car trip and it saved my sanity. The humor is delightful.
2,bloomin' blunder!,"This was my first venture into the Shopaholic series after hearing/reading so many great reviews. But I can't say that I'm a fan of Becky's. I wanted to reach into the pages and give her a good shaking. I found her very annoying because she can't seem to get her priorities straight or stand up for herself. I felt like the book could have been 300 pages shorter. I didn't need all the going back and forth or her not telling Luke the truth. If she's going to marry the guy, how can she be scared of him? Not exactly the relationship to base a marriage on!"
3,Decent book but not as good as the first two,I would be lying if i said i didn't like this book. I did enjoy it for the most part. I felt the other two books about Becky were much better and easier to read. This one lacked some depth. I was pretty amazed at what Becky did at the ending...now that took some serious guts!
2,what's fun about this?,I don't get it. Why am I still reading this book? And there is no real clear understanding of what Luke actually sees in Becky... their relationship makes no sense and is not fleshed out in any way. She is so shallow and basically has the same problem over and over - dishonesty! We are supposed to admire her - NOT! I do think that there are some fun characters - Robin the wedding planner and all of the extravagance of the ridiculous wedding are a lot of fun - but this girl really needs to get her act together. It's hard to sustain a book of this length over one idea - a girl who finds it impossible to tell the truth. This is no funnier than her shopaholicism... Why is this series so popular...
4,The book to improve your mood - for sure,"Nice and funny book. It entertains you, makes you laugh and feel better. Even though the story has happy ending, the characters and dialogues are real, so it does not feel like in bad Hollywood movie. I read it in one sitting and enjoyed very much....on the second thought - this book could be transformed into nice playscreen and nice Hollywood movie (J. Aniston as Bekky?:-)"
1,no more love for becky,"i adored the character of becky in the first books but now, oh my god, what a mess, she is very immature, and sorry to say this but plain stupid, she does not deserve luke, shes lucky she got herself a rich husband, i was hoping to see something else, not this, big dissapoinment, sorry."
3,Shopaholic Ties the Knot,"This has been my favorite of the series as of yet. Becky and Luke are living in NYC, and Becky is planning their wedding. Well, 2 weddings. Luke's mother has a grand, stop the press wedding in the works and Becky's mother has a quaint home ceremony in England she is planning. Neither know about the others plans, and of course Becky can't decide which to proceed with.Luke's character becomes much more ""real"" in this book. We see how his relationship, or lack thereof, with his mother really affects him. We see a real relationship between Luke and Becky as well.The characters seem to have a bit more substance in this book, as compared to the others. We still have the laugh out loud moments, and the "" I cant believe she did that"" moments. I cant wait to read the next in the series!"
3,The Becky character gets flat and tiresome in this book,"People who loved the first two installments of the Shopaholic series should prepare to be disappointed in this third book. The humor and whimsy that made me fall in love with Becky are gone. The central plot here is that Becky buries her head in the sand while conflicting weddings in two different parts of the world are being planned for her. The drama was entertaining for 20 pages, but NOT for an entire book. She could have easily resolved the situation by having one real wedding and one blow-out wedding party, which is something many couples who have a need to celebrate in two places do. The drama was stretched out, and I did not admire Becky as a woman for her lack of initiative or backbone."
3,three stars because it's not in the trash,"If I finish a book, it gets three stars. But, that's not saying much is it? This is simply brain candy. It drove me nuts that this girl couldn't just say what needed to be said. I won't say much else to ruin the read for anyone but for cripe's sake, grow a spine Becky.Sophie's writing style is fine, she just needs to find a character who's more likable and someone you'd actually like to meet."
2,glaring error,"The book is okay. However, why dont editors catch major errors? There is a significant problem with certain dates stated in this book. The date issue nullifies the entire premise for the ending. This ruined the book for me. If the error had not been there, I would have found the book much more enjoyable."
2,Lost its Fizz...,"Part 3 of Shopaholic series. Sophie Kinsella has lost the plot, she should not attempt to write an entire story on where to hold a wedding, too mundane!There is no intrigue unlike Parts 1 & 2 of Shopaholic series. The plot is too flat and does not create any excitement and feel good endorphins. I felt too tired and a sheer waste of time reading this Part 3. Kinsella should have condensed this story into Part 2 instead to make it more digestable."
2,What happened?,"I've just finished the previous shopaholic books, but this one is no where good as the other two. The story was dragged on way too long. It was about Becky being indecisive the whole time-whether she should have the wedding in NY or England. It wasn't funny like the other two, nor was it that intresting. I found myself struggling to finish half way through the book."
2,"It's a great idea, but Sophie doesn't carry it off","In the third installment about Miss Becky Bloomwood, I found that the character hasn't grown up one little bit. She is as whiny, foolish, selfish, aggravating, and out-of-touch with reality as she was in the first two books. It was a challenge to finish this book, and I wanted to give it the heave-ho early on. The ending was good, but the book was much longer than necessary to tell the tale. I found myself wanting to slap the maddeningly moronic title character when she, yet again, won't take responsibility for anything in her life. So many hundreds of pages about someone who insists on re-inserting her head into the sand gets old, quick."
3,Stale idea,"The first book Confessions of a Shopaholic was amusing and fun and creative. But it's the third strike and she's out on this one...I thought the book was silly and boring. If you liked the first two books you would like this one simply because you want to know how everything turns out and because Becky Bloomwood is such a likeable character. But if you're picking this book up without having read the first two, don't bother. It will come across as mindless dribble."
3,Weakest of the three,"Alright, the ""Shopaholic"" books are not high art, nor am I looking for them to be. The first two were fun, fast reads; somewhat predictable but likeable none the less. I'm afraid to say that I did not enjoy this installment nearly as much as the others. Becky seems to be somewhat cured of her out of control spending, unfortunatly she also seems to have become a spineless simpering girl unable to make any type of decision. The plot ends up becoming tiresome, and Becky's schtick is definately wearing thin. I think the series has run out of steam, but something tells me ""A Shopaholic Gets Preggers"" can't be far behind. 2.5 Stars."
5,Shopaholic Ties the Knot,"Becky Bloomwood, now a Barney's personal shopper, has settled down in a West Village home with her soon-to-be husband, Luke Brandon. Being a busy man, Luke leaves the wedding preperations to Becky. Somehow in the mix Becky ends up with 2 weddings, and both she can't back out of. One is being held by her mother, who she loves dearly and wouldn't want to hurt and another is being held by Luke's mother, a complete cow whom Becky doesn't like at all and visa versa. Suze, her pregnant best friend, urges Becky to cancel Luke's mother's wedding but Becky learns that she could be sued by cancelling it and there is no way she could heartbreak her mother like that. How will Ms. Bloomwood get out of this one?This book is great. Sophie Kinsella never fails to entertain. Many say that sequels are never as good as the original, but she proves that stereotype wrong. I recommend this book to anyone who loves a good laugh."
4,"Becky, Becky, Becky......","Becky Bloomwood shows us that she is incurable. For all of her efforts toward self control in Confessions of a Shopaholic and Shopaholic Takes Manhattan, she seems to have made little progress on the fronts of truth-telling and money management. This tale has too many turns and begins to get uninteresting. If Becky weren't almost like a friend, one might consider giving up on her and the book. Good ole' Suze never fails her friend Becky and supports her until the end. I'm anxiously awaiting the September 2004 release of Shopaholic and Sister as, from what we've been told, Becky doesn't have a sister."
4,Fun Read!,"This book is another fun read in this series. I kept wanting to turn the page and keep reading to see what happened next which is something I love about a book. I like some of Sophie's other books better, Undomestic Goddess and Remember Me - but that said, this is a good read and I would recomend it."
4,great series,love this series. i think you could read it without reading the previous books and still know what's going on.
5,"Great series, great book",Loved it!!!Over the top at times but that's why we love the series.Great book!
3,Self-centered,"I miss the author's GOOD books (Remember Me, and Can You Keep a Secret). This book was hard to read because the main character is self-involved to the point of idiocy. Her best friend even calls her a selfish cow near the end of the book. She is not endearing or likable in the least, and I found my self rolling my eyes a lot, and not in the ""this character is so zany"" way. The only reason I gave three stars is because Sophie is still a good writer. I think I'll abandon the Shopaholic series after this book."
5,Fun. lighthearted read!,Reading this series is laugh out loud funny to me! Obviously its a book so the things that are going on are for pure entertainment and to take lightly. I have enjoyed reading this series and am excited to now read onto the last two in the 6!
5,Love yet another Shopaholic!,"When they announced the wedding in the very beginning of the book I thought it meant the story was going to drag on...not that I didn't know the book was going to be about getting married. Boy was I wrong though. The book had so many twists and turns and again there were many different story lines going on at once, it was never boring. Instead of counting down the pages to finishing the book I was looking at the number of pages left wishing it were longer. I don't know what I'll do when I get to the last book in the series! Buy it, read it, love it!"
2,It's Ok,I love part 1 and 2 off this series.They made me laugh reading them.This onebored me to tears.The Sister and Baby ones are just as boring to me.
3,Much better than book #2,"I just finished reading this book, which is almost as funny as the first ""Shopaholic"" book. The proposal scene, in the beginning, was so unique. The story has progressed, and the author focused on more challanging problems. Yet, all this is accomplished with humor. A great light read for anyone."
4,Not a typo!,"In response to some reviewers who have suggested that the wedding dates were a typographical error: this is not the case. If you do the time conversion, Kinsella chose the dates and times that she did in order to make Becky's eventual solution possible.If Kinsella had indeed made the dates exactly the same, e.g. June 21, Becky would have had to choose the opposite solution, which would have been possible too, but less plausible and less emotionally satisfying.Of course, it is also slightly implausible that Becky was freaking out even when the dates were the 21st and the 22nd...but chalk it up to her being accustomed to travelling back and forth between continents, and ""losing"" or ""gaining"" a day.Clearly I love Becky's character, and all of her dearly beloveds, else I wouldn't be up at 4:17am defending her and her story! :) Sophie, thank you ever so much for this series."
2,rating applies only to quality of the eBook,"If you want to read Swann's Way and don't have the actual book, then DO NOT bother with *THIS* Kindle edition (the freebie). Instead, you might as well ""splurge"" on a $0.99 professionally created edition so that you'll get to read the real thing.1) All accented letters are converted as question marks.2) Indented text such as block quotes or lines of poetry were entirely dropped. Without the real book to compare, the blanks would've been inexplicable, annoying gaps in the narrative.That's enough to make this freebie worth less than i paid for it.I do find this edition useful as a companion to the actual book."
2,don't bother!,"This is the public-domain C K Scott Moncrieff translation from the 1920s. You can get it without cost from the Gutenberg Project. By no means should you pay money for it.Far better you get the paperback of the Penguin edition translated by Lydia Davis:Swann's Way: In Search of Lost Time, Vol. 1 (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition). Alternately, go for the much-improved Enright edition of the Scott Moncrieff translation:In Search of Lost Time: Volume 1, Swann's Way (Modern Library Classics) (v. 1). More about all this at ReadingProust dot com -- Dan Ford"
1,Worthless For Programmers,"Agree completely with all of the other reviewers in respect to practical working examples and detailed information. This is nothing more than a high-level overview of documentation and specifications you can easily find yourself on the internet. Look elsewhere (and yeah, I'm still looking myself) for solid information about how to design and deploy WS-* applications."
3,Good intro but needs an update,"This book would help you if you need an introduction to Web services security standards. If you need to know the strategies for how to implement then this book may not help much. Some of the specifications discussed in the book is not complete and there is lot of confusion in the standards committee moving forward. I bought this book before I bought the Core Security Patterns which details both the standards and patterns-based implementation strategies for Web services security. This book also needs a revision in terms of updating to SAML 2.0, WS-Security 1.1, WS-I Basic Security profile."
2,Weak examples.,"This book delivers good introduction to WS-* specs beyond that I don't find much help. From a developer perspective, the book does'nt help with good examples, it is missing with coding guidance and also lacks detail about the PKI in Web services. Possibly this book is too early to market before the specs are endorsed by OASIS. It's time for a revision..otherwise I could've added two more stars."
2,Good nice book but clueless about security/cryptography,"I like the book, the way it's organized and presented - but am finding glaring conceptual mistakes (not typos!) in security and crypto field. Unfortunately this forces me to question and doubt every bit of information they provided: if in such a simple trivial case they managed to screw it up (and I can notice it!) - in how many other cases did they also screw up but I can't notice because I'm not an expert there (one of the reasons I picked this book was to learn about the areas I've no expertise in!).For an example of what I'm talking about - take page 19 and get horrified at their (wrong!) definition of non-repudiation."
2,"Unnecessarily complicated, insufficiently explained","This book is written in a way that both the novice and expert readers don't understand. Readers are told to take the author's words for granted, and not to think.You should search for ""Attacking XML security"" before reading this book, to judge the content of the book in your own way."
5,Identical to originals,"Aluminum mesh range hood filters sag and otherwise deteriorate with age.Broan-Nutone are well-established brands,and spares will likely be available for awhile,but having replacement filters on hand,e.g. to swap in while running one pair thru the dishwasher,is not a bad thing. The 30"" Allure I (QS) series hood does notflow massive amounts of air, even with clean filters,so keeping filters clean is essential to adequate fume removal."
1,"Broan BPS1FA30 30-Inch Aluminum Replacement Filters for QS1 and WS1 Range Hoods, 2-Pack","Broan BPS1FA30 30-Inch Aluminum Replacement Filters for QS1 and WS1 Range Hoods, 2-PackI purchased this filter set with the full expectation that the set will replace the aged filters in my range hood. What arrived was a soup dish shaped set for some other application.When I asked for a RMA, the seller, not Amazon itself, only granted a refund, not a replacement. As a result, I am now stuck with either keeping the useless merchandise, or paying for the shipping, which is about 1/2 of the cost of the filter set.I am very dissatisfied with this seller. It was their error that pulled the incorrect item, now I have to pay for their incompetence?Amazon, reel your sellers practices in. This is totally unacceptable. I wanted to make it zero stars, but it would not let me.Bernie"
3,filters,this product is not like the original.it is missing the two inserts which keep it in place.i had to make the holes myshelf.
3,"Great spatula, not great handle",I wanted a nice firm spoon spatula and this one is great as far as the head goes. But the handle is very user un-friendly as it is thin and wide and doesn't feel natural while stirring.
4,Pretty Nice,"This silicone spatula is heavy duty, very thick silicone. Unfortunately, this means it isn't as flexible as I like for things like scraping a bowl when baking. This will be a very good multipurpose item though, it can be used for probably anything that you would normally use a wooden spoon for. The handle isn't the most comfortable out there, but it is sturdy. It is rated heat proof up to 500 F, which is great in case you for some reason forget about it in a pot (but the handle will probably be hot if touching the pan). Overall, it's a well constructed item, and it will certainly get use in the kitchen even if you are just throwing it in your basket to get free shipping (like me)."
5,Heavy handle,"I miss the really good rubber spoon-shaped spatulas and have been looking for some time for replacements. The rubber scrapes great but it absorbs odors and colors and always feels sticky. I purchased two: this one and a Zyliss. This one was obviously cheaper. The handle is stainless steel, which is good, but it feels rather heavy in my hand. It has a silicone head so is extremely heat resistant and dishwasher safe. I just received it so I have not had the time to use it and I will return with a updated critique if it does not scoop and scrape well, which are the major reasons I use this kind of spatula. (I do not use them cooking.)"
1,I love this movie yet due to ongoing problems with Amazon streaming it is unwatchable.,I love this movie yet due to ongoing problems with Amazon streaming it is unwatchable.Quite simple this is a wonderful movie.Problems with Amazon streaming are still major.It makes watching the movie not worthwhile.Audio is out of sync.Artifacts and dropped frames.I have high speed broadband and no problems streaming Netflix or other programming on either my Samsung Smart TV or my computer. Yet with Amazon it is a PITA.
3,Could be longer.,"I love the record, but it could be much longer for the price. Of course, Disney always milks any profit. It is still a delight to hear Satchmo again, and doing my favorite childhood songs."
1,I should learn from others.,"I was very excited when I saw finally this group had a blu-ray concert available. Unfortunatly, I thought ; Maybe the two previous reviewers had it all wrong, being they posted about PS3.I too had the same problem. I tried it on three diferent blu-ray players. Panasonic, Sony and a computer. I requested an exchange, thinking... Perhaps was just a bad disk. When the new one arrived. I played both back to back on two players. Sound but no video or at best intermitent. I checked cables,firmware and zone. Very dissapointed. So I returned them both today for a refund."
1,Blu-ray doesn't work,Ordered from US Amazon.com and doesn't work in my PS3. Is this region code issue???
3,It Should Have Been So Much More,"Indifferent writing, a surprising lack of insight into the incredible milieu in which she moved, and gratuitously catty remarks towards the great Leonora Carrington (an earlier Ernst protege who Tanning apparently feels threatened by 50 years after the fact) mar what should have been a very interesting memoir of a remarkable life. Tanning, Max Ernst's companion of 30 years and a compelling painter in her own right, was at the heart of one of the great artistic movements of the 20th Century, but this work reads like a flat travel log of places gone to and roll call of persons met. The paucity of detail,personal anectdotes, and characterization of any of the luminaries mentioned mark Tanning's bio as a great disappointment.--A two star book with one star added because any information on this artistic epoch provided by an active participant has to be considered an important contribution."
2,Good looks except for those cheap handles,"This toaster looks great. The matt finish won't show finger prints, wipes clean easily. The old fashioned heat settings are like radio tuner knobs. Nicely made. The settings include ""bagel"" which means in only heats one side the same as if you broiled a bagel.Except for one small detail which would drive me nuts. The handles for lowering the toast are the cheapest plastic. They wiggle like they are ready to fall off. It's like they spent all their manufacturing money on the case, the heat knobs, the controls and then said ""Whoops! We can't make any money on this, cut the cost somewhere."" So the nice handles went and these were slapped on. What were these guys thinking? The part you use the most has the cheapest feel! If I'm buying a top of the line toaster, I'll pay to have it ALL perfect."
2,Just another pretty face,"This toaster is really good looking. In fact, it is so good looking that we have tried to overlook its shortcomings:Heats so slowly that the bread dries out.Pop-up doesn't really pop high enough to easily grab the toast.Toasts unevenly.The toaster does have a bagel setting, and that works better than the bread setting. Still, the results are uneven.We really like toast and bagels in our family, so we're replacing this one."
2,"Great look, if that's all you want","I gave this toaster a 2 star rating because it does look great, which bumped it from one star. However, from day one all it does is burn anything that goes into it, even at it's lowest setting. Nice bagel setting but it too burns the one side to a crisp. Not worth the money and I'm embarrassed I spent so much on a toaster thinking the DeLonghi name was worth it. It wasn't. Going back to a $20 toaster....."
1,Not so good,"I got this toaster cause it was a good brand and on sale. I thought it looked really nice and it does go well with the other appliances in my kitchen, but it doesn't work worth a damn. SInce day one my toast has been unevenly toasted. And even at the highest setting, my bread is more slightly warm and over-dry than actually toasted. I like the bagel setting, but don't use it because I always forget which direction to put the bagel in... Pretty much, I really wish I had not bought this toaster. I am amazed that the company still sells it actually."
1,Newlyweds very disappointed!,"We had this very cool looking toaster on our wedding registery and were thrilled to receive it as a gift. Ouch - can looks ever deceive. It never toasted evenly or enough no matter which setting it was on. The toast did not pop up far enough to just pluck out but we had to pry it out. Lastly, I don't expect my appliances to die after 2 years of minimal use. We now have a toaster from Goodwill which works much better."
1,Sloooooowww!,"I have had this toaster for more than 5 years. I wish it would break. This is the slowest toaster I have ever used. I place the bread in the toaster, then break eggs, scramble them, and place them on the plate before the bread is toasted. You also have to elevate the toast by using the handles in order to remove it from the toaster. Very fashionable, but not worth purchasing at any cost."
2,"Buy it for looks, not for function","The other bad reviews about this toaster are all true, it really is just a gimmick. Buy this toaster for looks if you'd like to have it in your kitchen, but also buy another cheap ten dollar toastermaster toaster from kmart or walmart and use that to make your actual toast behind the scenes--believe me, the toast will come out a lot better and I bet the ten dollar toaster will even last longer!"
2,Still working but we're looking elsewhere,"We've owned this toaster for 2 years now. Because it's lasted that long and due to it's appealing looks, we give it the 2 stars. As for using it for toasting, it rates very poorly. The toast darkness control is unreliable. Leave it in one place and get light toast at one time and dark the next. It has a silly mechanism that supposedly allows for better control when toasting bagels or muffins. The control is useless. The worst part of the machine, however, is that it is nearly impossible to retrieve the toast, bagel, whatever, without getting burned. More than once we've been forced to turn the toaster upside down to get our breakfast (toast and millions of crumbs). Buy it for it's looks, look elsewhere for making toast."
4,A decent value,"I will say that I have tried quite a few consumer-end depp fryers in my time. This one makes hastening your death and hardening your arteries easier and cleaner than ever: the snap-shut lid, odor filter and incredibly cool oil release valve all make this deep fryer a far cry from the $20 excuse for an appliance you'd find at most department stores. And do follow the instructions to the letter: the instructions say use peanut oil for best results. Sadly, vegetable and canola oils just do not cut it."
2,"Great idea, but bad design","I purchased my fryer in January after my other open top fryer died. I researched many days before deciding on this one. The first two times I used it, I was in heaven! THEN the third time I added the same amount of product that I had in the past and it proceeded to boil over! ( through the filtered vent area) I had to raise and lower the basket constantly in order to keep the unit from boiling over. I read in the manual that this could happen with wet food or if I added to much. I adjusted my amounts and also dried off the french fries with a paper towel (very time consuming) It still boiled over! I lowered the temperature and guess what?? it boiled over! And if that isnt enough, the oil that condenses on the top of the lid pours out the back of the unit as you open the lid. What a terrible mess it makes. So, either I bought the only lemon out there, or Delonghi needs to make some changes!"
2,Works great but dangerous,"I loved this deep fryer until something electrical burned out inside and caught the unit on fire. Luckily I was in the kitchen when this happened and I was able to yank the plug out of the wall and put out the fire.I might buy another one some day because it worked well and it is possible that this event was a fluke, but I assure you I will never leave this deep fryer unattended again, nor will I leave it plugged in when I'm not using it. If you already own one of these I suggest you do the same.I give this fryer 5 stars for usability and 0 stars for safety."
1,a total mess,followed directions exactly - making french fries - well drained - grease bubbled out of the filter area creating a large puddle of hot oil all over the counter. oil level was exactly as indicated - used peanut oil. cleaned up the mess - next time worse than ever - threw the unit in the trash - a total waste of money and very very dangerous.
4,thumbs up,"I recently purchased this after reading customer reviews of this product. This is my first fryer and I though it was easy to use and easy to clean. The first time I used it, I made doughnuts. I thought the heating element maintained the temperature well and cooked the doughnuts rather evenly. Clean up was really easy using the hose/drain feature. I simply drained the oil back into the oil bottles and I was essentially done. The teflon coating makes clean-up exceptionally easy."
2,Hope you don't need parts or repairs.,"My mom bought this for my wife and I and it is a good fryer. God forbid if you ever need a part or repairs. Delonghi customer service will NOT send you a part directly, and they have very limited number of ""Authorized Service Centers"". I live hours from the nearest one and they still wouldn't send me a simple part. They want me to ship it to the nearest service center, pay for a repair and then have it shipped back which will cost almost as much as this fryer. I'm getting a different brand instead. On top of all of this the customer service rep. was snippy and rude."
2,still looking,"....for a better one.After few weeks of use,I still got oil coming from the back of it when in use!!!!....even if the oil level is between the lines.Frying process is fast."
4,Krs-one - A true Legend,"Krs-one is the prime definition of an MC - A raw voice, dope flows and a highly influential lyricist. Krs-one started his career with the release of his debut classic album ""Criminal Minded"" the album was instantly hailed as a classic and was influential upon its release. He continued his comeback In late 80s and early 90s with albums like ""By all mean neccesary"" and ""Retun of the Boom rap"". I wouldn't say this is the essential Krs-one album, you would better purchase his great solo albums but this is not bad at all.Retrospective features krs greatest songs. ""The bridge is over"" is often looked as the blueprint for diss records. Other great songs like ""My philosephy"" ""South bronx"" and ""Criminal Minded"" are some of the best hip-hop has ever had to offer. Definitly purchase this album for your collection."
4,A must own for true rap lovers,"KRS one is so classic. This album puts together some of his greatest songs, with good old school beats and thougtful, powerful lyrics that keep it pumpin. There are a few tracks, however, that I usually skip over cause they're kind of annoying. KRS One is a hip hop legend and I highly recommend this album."
4,missing a few..,"I am a white guy who got very into KRS-One back in the late 80's. In my mind he is the best and most talented rapper there ever has been. His great attention to lyrics and content cannot be touched by anyone in the rap community. While I find this cd to be loaded with great tracks (long over-due as well!) there are of course some missing. As another reviewer mentioned, ""13 and good"" and ""duck down"" are huge omissions, but also all the other tracks he was on such as ""heal"" (human education against lies) and ""self destruction"" are too big to be ignored. Not being as fond of some his recent material I feel that some of the above mentioned tracks may have been a better fit, but who is to say..all in all still a great cd and mc.."
2,buy the albums,"...This ""greatest hits"" compliation skips most of The Professor's dopest material, and in so doing it paints a woefully incomplete picture of his true microphone prowess. This does a disservice to hip-hop in general and KRS-ONE in particular. So why did I pick it up? Two words: Gift Certificate."
5,a good introduction to yum yum!,"this is a very basic and easy cookbook for young children-probably ages 5 to 11.it has easy to follow steps and and i do not see how anyone could make mistakes.contents are:sandwiches:(""tuna treasure boats""),beverages:(""fruit crush"" and ""purple cow""),cookies,candies,desserts and snacks:(""cornflake kisses,""lolli-cots"",""pudding cones""),lunches,brunches,and breakfasts:(""pizza muffins"",""orange honey toast"",""candlestick salad"").the book is illustrated throughout with cute cartoon drawings of different colors.there are about 57 recipes in this book. a nice book to teach with and everyone should have fun-even adults!"
2,Maxtor Personal Storage Carrying Case,The bag was too small for carrying the maxtor portable drive and all the interface cables and power adapter.
5,great yarn about a liaison pilot in the Pacific,"Dare I say ""enchanting"" about a war memoir? Honest, Don Moore has accomplished that feat. Nearly 50 years on, he wrote this yarn about his service, flying a Piper Cub L-4 500 feet above Japanese lines, as a spotter for American artillery. His only armament was a Colt forty-five and sometimes an M-1 carbine in the hands of his backseat passenger. He had a dogfight with a Zero (no damage done on either side) and a harrowing flight through the clouds without IFR instruments, while Japanese ack-ack shells exploded around him and fast American bombers dashed through the soup beside him. There's a great chapter also about the Brodie Device, which enabled a Cub to fly off a landing craft, running along a wire suspended to one side--and even to ""land"" again on the same wire. First class."
4,Good show!!,"My sister and I got this for my dad!! He loves it, its one of his favorite show know!!!=+D"
5,Entertaining - as always,Mike does a wonderful job putting humor into jobs that are far from it. This was a great collection from Season 1.
3,Hammerhead shark,"Yeah, it seems like a pretty good plush toy for a young one, but I'm not too impressed with the customer svc. It arrived in a torn paper envelope (handwritten) and the toy had ink or something all over it. I ordered another one, and (3 weeks) later it came. This one was in OK condition but the handwritten envelope was written in barely legible cursive with almost every part of the name and address spelled wrong.Oh yeah, and look closely at the photo and you can see: a drinking glass holding up the shark... needs some Photoshop work if you ask me :\\"
3,NO TILT DOWN,"I was so happy when I received it. It is well made and seems durable. Installing is not a rocket science, so I was ready in 15 minutes. Articulated joints work really great, allowing for the setting of the monitor in different heights and angles in space, providing that you don't want to tilt it down below 90 degrees angle. Yes BEWARE that that there is no tilt down adjustment only 90 degrees and up so you can watch the monitor from almost the ceiling. However, watching from underneath, when monitor is installed above your head is impossible. Unfortunately, It didn't work in my set-up and I had to send it back. If it had the tilt down adjustment it would be perfect and still my be for somebody not requiring that feature."
3,"Product functions very well, but was a little big for my home office","This Lx Dual Desk monitor arm functions very well and is very easy to assemble - but was a little big for my home office.In my case, the desk faces out towards the office door - so when people walked in the first thing they saw were the dual arms of the monitor stand - most people commented that it looked like something you would see on a spaceship.Having said that, the stand was very adjustable and did a very nice job freeing up desk space. If you are not concerned about the bulky look, or if your visitors will see only the front of the monitors, then I would highly recommend this stand.In the end, I returned this product and bought the Ergotron DS100 Dual-monitor Desk Stand - it takes up a little bit more desk space, but is not quite as bulky (however, the DS100 doesn't have anywhere near the same level of adjustment that the Lx Dual Mount has)."
4,Works better than I expected,I was a little unsure if this would work as well as it said...but I was surprised to see how good it looked and how easy it moves around to just about any position you desire.
4,Great hair product; questionable hair growth qualities,"I have curly hair. I use a bit of volumizer (Kevin Murphy) followed by this product to style my hair. This gel is non-sticky and non-oily, and gives hit good definition and hold, while also expanding the shaft somewhat to make hair appear slightly fuller.It states that it contains anti-DHT ingredients, such as Saw Palmetto. The jury seems to be out on whether Saw Palmetto actually assists with hair issues at the end of the day (and I suspect it doesn't; as there is more to hair loss than DHT). So, I can't say whether the product is helpful in that regard. They should do a better job in their marketing literature and packaging of explaining exactly which ingredients do what, supposedly, to help hair health. Still, it's nice knowing that there MIGHT be some active ingredients in the bottle that are helpful during the day."
4,TIMEX IRONMAN TRIATHION,"VERY PLEASED WITH THE PURCHASE OF THE TIMEX IRONMAN TRIATHLON, THE DIGITAL NUMBERS ON THE WATCH ARE LARGE AND EASILY READ THE COMBINATION OF THE STAINLESS STEEL AND BLACK MATERIAL OF THE WATCH BAND MAKES IT MOST ATTRACTIVE AND STURDY,I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS SAME WATCH IN A GOLD FINISH."
5,Nice for sports and for dress.,"I bought the first Ironman watch in 1978, then I bought this 25th anniversary edition in 2003. It has been a fine watch. I use it for timing my runs, for swimming, and wear it in the shower or anywhere I want. I purchased a 5 year warranty for $5, and got it replaced in 2006, due to the timer failing. The second one has performed flawlessly. For the price and the durability of Timex watches you can't beat it."
2,Father's Day Present,My husband likes the Timex Ironman watch; therefore I was excited to find this one on Amazon.com at a discounted price. We have been disappointed since we have had to repair it three times now. The two pins closest to the watch were apparently not aligned correctly and his watch has just fallen off his arm while he was sitting. If it happens again we will probably return it.
1,Broken Watch,"The Timex watch that was purchased as of January 17, 2008 is broken as of February 10, 2008. This is the second watch that we have purchased from timex. Both watches were exacly the same. The second watch was purchased because the first one broke. I would not recommend this particular watch to anyone. The pin holding the band to the face has been the repeat offender."
1,So great!!! But it broke in 2 months!!!,Ridiculous... I bought in June 8. It last only enough to expire the return window. It's not working since 2 weeks ago...
2,well....it has a sexy cover.,"As a HUGE Runaways fan, I couldn't wait to get this CD in the mail.A word of advice: This is not Runaways music. It's a totally different genre, a different world. No guitar hooks or hot leads. No fantastic rhythm. No pounding drums. No wailing vocals, no screams.Soft, sexy vocal. Smooth, lite pop. It's just not what I expected, as I am a new Runaways fan, and have been catching up on what I missed. Fans of ""Strawberry Fields"" on ""Flaming Schoolgirls"" will probably enjoy this CD, as it's pretty much all in that vain."
2,"Cutie, but very little talent","Cherie Currie is a cutie but has very little true talent as a singer. She was recruited to the Runaway for her looks, and she filled that shoe well, but her voice is only mediocre. Although, Joan Jett has always been a hottie and has the best voice of them all, so I'm not sure why she didn't always front the band?!?!? All the ladies continue to look more and more attractive as they age!"
4,Ultra Cool,"This is a cool CD by Ultra, a new British boy band. They may look like another of the squeaky clean pop acts, but they play their instruments and write the music. The best ones on this album are Say You Do and BASIC."
5,An old favorite,"I've had this little guy for a long time and he's always been one of my favorites. I love foxes and this one really stood out to me. However, after years of use through my childhood its fur has become quite matted. The beanie babies with this type of fluffy fur don't seem to hold up well to children. Overall though I am very pleased with this toy and would recommend it to other fox lovers."
1,ordered the snow fox but got delivered with a deer!!,"since am ordering from overseas, it's literally not feasible at all for me to return the item.hence the 1 star rate."
5,Tank and the Jolly Ball,Tank loves it and it is holding up well for a bulldog toy. This is one of the few toys that he hasn't destroyed in less than an hour :0)
2,Not as good as before,"I have two Labs and they played with the previous Jolly Ball for several years, enjoying a tug-o-war game day after day, and while it eventually became shredded it took a long time to get that way.I recently purchased a new ball (I was having to cut pieces off the old one until it was nearly just a small bowl shape) and I've had it for about a week and a half, it's already broken at the handle and is just about to come apart already. I'm not at all pleased with the life from this ball--not at all. My girls aren't playing any differently with this new one than they did with the old one, and the new one is just not standing up to they're normal activity. I won't buy another one."
3,Did not survie,"Sadly, my pit/boxer mix was able to damage this in about 20 minutes. So far the only item I have found that lasts more than a day is the galileo nylabone."
5,Great resource!,"What a great book. My stepdad was rebuilding the carb in his 81 Vette, and he's been a mechanic for 35+ years, and was struck. he asked around for this book, and I was able to get it on Amazon, a week later he told me this is the best book he's read on any car part. Great instructions, walks you right through the rebuild, perfect all around. If your looking to rebuild your Rochester carb, this is the book to get"
3,Rochester Carburetors,I was looking a manual to help repair or customize my carburetor. this book don't really go into details but a description of other carburetors and their roles in the auto industry. Informative but not helpful..
3,It's the Bible for Quadrajets,"I successfully rebuilt a Quadrajet from this book. That's not to say I didn't have my moments of frustration because the book seems to be an amalgamation of segments written at different times -- and the content on one section doesn't seem fully aware of the content in another section.The key is to spend the time to identify your particular carburetor. Down to the last digit or number. The author will assume you know exactly which carburetor you have.A few little things like the position of the float valve retaining clip or how useful a thin spatula is when reassembling the horn weren't very obvious but go a long way to making your life easier. ""Reassemble in the reverse of disassembly"" just doesn't cut it as far as I'm concerned."
2,"Rochester Carburetors: Tune, Rebuild or Modify","This book did not provide the basic tuning I was looking for. This book provide good technical information on carborators and modifications. Doesn't tell me how to adjust things like mixture, speed, choke and vacuum related stuff."
5,A must for Rochester carburators lovers,This is the single best carburetor book I have ever read! Read it cover to cover. Bought The book in '73 and am thinking of buing it again because the old one is getting a bit worn from use.
4,"Good Technical data, Good pictures","After bying the Haynes manual which was fairly detailed with it's description of removal and disassembly, I found it lacking detailed information on exacly how this specific carburator works and how to get to actually meter correctly. So, I bought this book. If there is a better book with more detailed information about the Rochester carburator, than this book by Doug Roe, I haven't found it. There is although a reference in the book on setting the air bleed valve (pg95) which then refers you to the ""manufacturer's idle mixture adjustment procedure"" and does not tell you where that procedure may be found, so I relied on my vacuum gauge and brake jack performance test to fine tune this. Also, pictures of detailed adjustments could be larger, and details of special tools could be more clear."
3,Okay Material....TERRIBLE KINDLE EDITING!!,"I was fortunate to be able to download this as a FREE Kindle book. I would never, ever recommend that someone pay for this book. While the author relied heavily on printed interviews, there was snarky commentary that did not add to an overall understanding of Ms. Judd or her family life. The Kindle edition is filled with poor formatting and numerous spelling errors to the point that it does interfere with reading the book. Perhaps the print edition is better..."
1,Very disappointing,"I've always liked Ashley Judd as an actress and I sympathize with her not having a perfect childhood. But who did? I admire Ashley's tenacity in reaching her goals andI admire her talents and gifts. But this book seemed to be more of a snipe fest against Naomi Judd and I didn't appreciate the author's nasty remarks towards her. I would rather have read the book from Ashley's point of view and even better, I'd appreciate it more if it were written by Ashley. I didn't appreciate hearing someone else tell her story and again did not appreciate all his snide This was just a pity festival and I'm sorry to have bought a non-refundable ticket."
3,Ashley Judd: Crying on the Inside,"This book was very good and a quick read. Learned alot about the family that has not been reveled before. If you are a Judd fan, I would recommend this book."
4,Good Read,"I read this book because I really like Ashley Judd. I'm not sure what the draw is but watching her in numerous different movies, I just have a great deal of respect for her. Love her smile and think she is a great actress. I don't read biographies as a rule, but really enjoyed this one and am amazed at what a wonderful person she has managed to turn out to be! I will make a point of reading her book as well."
3,Bitter Rich woman,Sad that such a accomplished women would come off small an bitter. What's not said is the most interesting. Where is her husband in all of this WOE IS ME. Many of us did not have great Mom's. The secert is to rise above them. She was till this stupid book. Failed marriage is the worse..Written well- ghost writer probadly. Shame on some one who looks to be sucessful- Guess Not
2,Many Errors,"You'd think in the day and age of IMDB the author would get Ashley's acting roles correct. There were several errors, the one that stood out to my was getting her character's name wrong on Star Trek: The Next Generation. In addition to the errors, it was just a poorly written book. There were detailed descriptions of some movies while others barely were mentioned. If you haven't seen some of the movies, there are spoilers."
5,Great product,"Our lab is ten and suffering from hip problems. We tried Cosequin and vet laser treatments. If anything these made our dog more miserable. I read about the hipbones natural cherry extract remedy. We gave it a try and it has helped our dog tremendously. I only see her limp once in a while now - usually when she's been laying around too long. So this product won't completely cure hip problems, but it will alleviate the pain and unlike the drug alternatives - it won't mask the pain."
2,pretty but painfully slow,we bought this because we love the look. However it takes way too long to make toast. Much slower than our old ... toaster. Also I don't like the fact that you have to press a button to stop the toasting instead of just pulling up on the handle. If I hadn't thrown away the old one I would be using it instead.
3,Appearance only,I checked this out at a store near me. It is kind of cheesy looking and it has Delonghi stamped on *both* sides. I can't rate the performance because I did not buy it based on the appearance.
2,looks good only,"Have had unit for several months. Variable settings are a waste since only at max or near max does the bread actually toast. This is second unit having had to return first due defects.The small plastic indicator lights tend to get pushed in at the slightest bump from any other appliance, so they become worthless (however very pretty when new). Even though we keep ours spotless clean, several bread pieces on one side have started to get stuck almost causing fire. This is precisely what I wanted to avoid from cheaper units and is dangerous. Was great when new and we used only English toasting bread, but quality over time in terrible. Will use as decoration, perhaps with a pole and lamp shade, might be able to sell it at a garage sale as a decorators oddity."
2,Cheap...,"...in quality, not price.The brushed-metal looks cheap and the plastic handles complete the impression.All in all, this looks like a plastic toaster. I passed on it and got the VillaWare Retro 4 Slice toaster instead. The VillaWare's not a Dualit, but it's way better than this thing, for just a little more."
2,incredible look but cheap inside,i buy this unit because of the look. but i hardly achive crispy brown toast. i have often to do it 2 time or at least put the defrost on the get correct toast. The build quality doesnt impress me. one side of the toaster his jammed for no reason.
1,Do NOT buy this toaster,"Buyer beware!!! It looks good, but doesn't work. One side of the 4-slice toaster went out after a couple months of having it. We called the 800# that came with it. It took a few calls to reach anyone, we left messages and no one ever got back to us. Finally, we reached a live person and received a service # and address to send the toaster back for repair. After a couple months we called to find out where our toaster was. We left numerous messages and no one ever got back to us. I know they recieved it because they signed for it. Anyway, it's a year later and they still haven't returned our calls or the toaster!! We bought a 4-slice CuisinArt that we're very happy with, but we're out our original $79. Save yourself the agony, don't buy this toaster."
4,Long term review,"We've had this toaster for about two years now and have been quite pleased with its performance. The ""look"" was our main motivator when we decided to buy this one, but it has proven to be quite the workhorse in our non-Atkins Diet household of four."
1,DeLonghi Toaster Exchange,"We saw this product in a store and decided we must have it to replace our toaster oven....we only used the toaster oven as a toaster. Our children presented the DeLonghi toaster to us as a Christmas gift and we were thrilled....thrilled, that is, until we tried to use it. One side would not go down. Much to our delight, we were able to exchange it. With great anticipation, we unwrapped the replacement, read all the instructions again, plugged it in and put in 4 slices of bread. We pushed the levers down and waited...and waited...and waited. The toaster did not heat up....well, we said, it must be a bad plug...we tried another plug which we were sure was perfectly functional. THE TOASTER DID NOT HEAT UP. When we returned the second one, we opted for another brand. Thus, the rating...if zero stars was an option, we would have used it. It looks great; wish it had worked."
4,Mini WOOD TOASTER TONGS with magnet,"In response: Your DeLonghis are working fine! The toast is not supposed to pop up! Crate & Barrel sells the tiny little toast tongs for about $3. The magnet is flush so they cling nicely to the side of my DeLonghi. And bagel people (MY FAVORITE FEATURE) flip the bagel around so only the INSIDE gets cooked instead of returning your toaster. Hmmmn, the bagels are soft on the outside and perfectly toasted for spreading on the inside. We have owned ours for almost 1 year, family of five, we have a lot miles on this thing and NO pieces have broken, fallen off or otherwise malfunctioned. Only 4 stars because of the weight, it so light, feels a little cheap. The tongs should be sold with it!"
1,Don't waste your money,"Delonghi products in my opinion are garbage...this toaster just died after 1 year. Never toasted correctly, always needed 2 cycles. It has not been heavily used as it is just for my wife and I.Also have a Delonghi kettle that started leaking in 8 months.Looks good...for what that is worth."
1,"Good Looks Don't Mean ""Good Toast""","The toaster is quite nice looking but it takes forever to brown a slice of bread. English muffins or bagel?....try two cycles.For the money I paid for this thing it should, AT A MINIMUM, deliver a slice of toast in under 4 minutes."
3,"Average performance, large footprint.","I purchased this toaster for it's retro styling. It's feel is rather cheap, it's performance is uneven and it's quite the spacehog. Previously had a Krups with two elongated slots ... so it could handle four standard slices or two long slices (like the incredible sliced Calandra my household loves). I should have stuck with the Krups until another two slot four slice came along. I'm back in the market again."
3,"Not full collection, disappointed","Love the books, high quality, but it is not readily apparent that it isn't the full set of books. I could have gotten the full set, which was my goal for cheaper elsewhere, but bought these thinking it was the full set only better quality. Sad that I can't gift the entire set now, but keeping them as it's too close to Christmas and not worth the trouble."
2,The Little House Collection,I thought I ordered the full collection. When it arrived it was only a part collection. The whole collection would have included two more books. I sent it back. I was very disappointed.
5,Family Entertainment,"This collection of ""Little House and the Prarie"" episodes from the first season has brought back many happy childhood memories for me. Its like stepping back to a time when old fashioned values were appreciated. I am thrilled to be able to share this quality enterainment with my young children. Every episode teaches a lesson in kindness, love and understanding. The locations are so beautiful and and life so simple then. My four year old loves it now, especially the episodes where Nelly Olsen gets whats coming to her! If you're worried about modern televisions negative influence in your childs behavior take control, go out and buy this. You will be very glad you did"
2,Beautiful Illlustrations and Colors but...,"in this set, which I gave to my daughter for Christmas, when she unwrapped it, the box was broken on two edges. We are reading book #3 and the pages have begun falling out. The quality of the set is the problem. The stories are wonderful."
3,"Beautiful, durable, but Heavy!","This is a very substantial paperback book set, with beautiful color illustrations, and well worth the price tag. However, I have just two comment regarding this set: 1) My 9-year-old daughter told me she prefers not to have pictures so she can imagine the characters the way she wants to, and 2) compared to the other Little House series, these books are much heavier (thicker pages), which is hard for her to hold up for long periods of time when she is reading in bed. The other books are much lighter, less tiring for her to hold. If you are looking for a library quality paperback that you are going to read to your children, then I highly recommend this quality set. If you are looking for a set for a young reader to read on her own, you may want to consider a less weighty set."
4,Little House Series,"Series came as promised. Very good condition other than minor damage in shipping. Only complaint is that it is a shame that, considering our national unemployment rate, a collection about the history of our pioneers has to be printed in China."
4,Books,Kids loved it. They are still using it. We bought this two years ago. Nothing more to add but to say it is an excellent item
5,The Little House Collection,"Purchased as a gift for a friend, item received as described, fast delivery, will purchase from vendor againThank youM Haynes"
5,Excellent and fast shipping,Excellent and fast shippingBy the way I have to return it because it 's only 5 booksACtually I need 8 books.
4,The Little House Collection Boxed Set (Full Color),"The Little House books are wonderful, and the color illustrations add to the appeal for children. I wish the entire series was included in this collection."
5,Get Cozy with the Little House Series,"The Little House series is one of my all time favorites, my absolute favorite of the whole series is Little House in the Big Woods. The descriptions of everything from the foods they prepared, what people wore and how they entertained themselves. Watching Laura grow up through the series was a real treat and this would be a great series for any girl around the age of 10 who can grow with the series."
5,Such historical details!!! Kids will be inspired to love history!,"The details in these stories are beyond belief. The things you will learn from reading them will serve you well if there is ever a zombie apocolypse and we have to learn to build houses without nails...I'm just saying. My daughters who are young, loved hearing the adventures that this family had it is something we will read again and again!"
5,Excellent Quality-Timeless Classics,"I ordered these books for my 11 yr old daughter. They are very nice heavy quality with excellent illustrations. She loves the Laura Ingalls Wilder series, & had them all read in 4 days. But she has already begun to reread some of them! Worth the investment for sure, & bargain priced compared to the rest of the series which must be purchased individually. We plan to read this series as a family in the long cold Montana winter ahead!"
1,Crap,"For some reason the car refuses to go into reverse. When you try to steer the car spins out. When turning the throttle engages. Don't waste your time, add some more money and get a full size rc car. Need to be right on top of the car for the tansmitter to work. Not expecting 100' range but more then 6'."
1,DO NOT GET THIS!!,I got my car last night.It always goes to a side and doesnt go strait.I went to toys R us and they even said a lot of people are returning them.Dont get this toy.
3,Very Good Product,"Very good product for the price. Density and thickness is not what you see in the picture, but is definitely worth the price. Vendor is extremely responsive and ships quickly. Would buy from again."
4,Nice product,I velcroed this on my table and it looks nice and the price is good. I would recommend this to others.
5,THE BEST BOOK EVER,"I got Confessions of a Shopoholic from the library on Monday and finished it in one day. The next day I left school early and ran out and bought not only the next two, Shopoholic takes Manhattan and Shopoholic ties the knot, but Confessions of a Shopoholic as well. I immediately sped home, locked myself in my room and by staying up till 3:15 in the morning finished the next two books during the same night. I can't tell you enough how fabulous all three of these books are. Everyone can in some way relate to Becky and her adventures are sooo funny that you won't put this book down until you have finished it. Now I am just depressed because there are no more of her books for me to read. PLEASE let there be one more sequel!!!!!!!"
4,really 4 1/2 stars,This book was hysterical...I laughed at the mayhem...and I know people like this <grin> If you enjoy and understand British humor...then this book is for you!
1,Ugggh!!!!!!,"This book is a perfect example why financial journalists' should stick to numbers. Did the author not consider seeking the advice of a literary advisor? The character's are underdeveloped and boring. And the plot? Just add water and you have the identical plot of any other 'chicklit' out today. Will she find love? Will she save money? Oh gosh, I'm so concerned! Will she survive without her ""pot's of moisturizer""? Unimaginative and shallow to say the least. Take some advise along with the main character, save your money by not purchasing this book."
4,I could find myself in this book,"what a hilarious book! i thought becky and i are twins!!i could find myself in this book. if you've ever thought that you're a shopoholic, this book is a must for you.probably you could stop buying stuff..."
5,AB FAB Book!,This book was one of the best books I've read in a while. It made me feel less bad about how much I spend.
4,"Good, but not great","I borrowed this book from a friend, and was pretty glad I didn't buy it myself. No, it's not a bad book, but, it's not great. The main character - Rebecca - is amazingly self-centered and concieted. Basically, in ""Confessions of a Shopaholic"" Rebecca Bloomwood has a problem. She shops all the time, and charges everything, but can't pay the bills, with the cruddy job she has. When Becky tries to quit, things get even worse ~ she can't stop buying things. Finally, the bank keeps calling, and she moves in with her parents. This book is funny, but the only reason it got 4 stars is because Becky's too self-centered. I really liked it, but some of the British lingo was confusing (Ex: in London, ""pissed"" means drunk). This is overall a good - and funny - book."
3,"Quick Read, Somewhat Funny, Pretty Unbelievable","If you want a quick ""beach"" read to keep you busy, this book has a bit of humor and entertainment for just that. But the character is just way too annoying, stupid, and ignorant for me to get that attached (even though I, myself, am a total shopaholic). I definitely recommend ""Good in Bed"" by Weiner instead if you want something quick, funny and with some real value. I won't be reading the other two in the trilogy."
3,Starts off slow,"By the time I was finished reading the book I really enjoyed it, but I would have never claimed that at the book's mid-point. Nothing really happens until the last few chapters, so be prepared! Nevertheless, it kept interested enough to actually finish the book, so it wasn't all bad. It's a definite summer read."
3,A one-joke proposition stretched to inordinate length,"This book TRIED to be Bridget Jones with a credit card, but it was one-dimensional: all about shopping. (Imagine if Bridget Jones was all about dieting). The writing and humor is fun otherwise."
5,Fabulous companion to those of us who know the value of an amazing sale,"Becky is my soulmate. I am convinced. If there was ever a character from a book that I would like to meet in real life it would definatelt be Kinsella's character. She is smart,witty and understands the importance of a scarf sale. A perfectly light read that you just ca'nt put down."
3,Mildy entertaining,"The first book i read by Sophia Kinsella was ""Can you keep a secret?"" and i really liked the book. So i picked up ""Confessions of a shopaholic"" without hesitation. The book kept me entertained- although it did get quite irritating to read over and over again about how Rebecca rationalizes all her spending sprees. My biggest problem with the book is the ending. The book just ends!! We have no idea what happens with Rebecca and Luke, or how her new tv show gig goes, etc. I understand that this is a series of books, but you have to have some closure!!!"
2,Eh,"As I got further along in this book, I started to hate Rebecca Bloomwood. What a self-absorbed, manic martyr. While I understand not handling finances well, it just seems as if she blames the world for her problems. And the plot twists were so obvious. And her sudden maturity at the end of the novel was so forced. As a final nail in the coffin, I felt it was such a ripoff of the Bridget Jones-esque style. HOWEVER, it was a light read, fluffy and sometimes enjoyable."
2,I'll wait for the sale.....,"My friend reccomended this book to me, saying that if I liked ""Bridget Jones' Diary"", I'd love this. She was sorely mistaken. While this book also takes place in London, that's where the similarities end. Becky Bloomwood is a whiney, unsympathetic charecter who I have absolutly no pity for. Two thirds of the book is discriptions of what shes bought and how they're such an ""investment"". Her methods of making more money are pathetic, desperate and unrealtistic. And why does she get the guy? Not only do they supposedly hate each other, the author makes it perfectly clear that Luke still thinks Becky's something special, making the ending no suprise whatsoever. Maybe some people like reading about spoiled brats. I don't."
2,"Stupid book, don't waste your money","I don't know what I was expecting, but it was more than this book delivered. It was boring, stupid and pretty mindless. I can't imagine anyone being as dumb as the heroine of this book. could not finish it."
5,Love it,"Hilarious, fell in love with Becky in this book. Her crazy ways of getting out of situations she gets herself in."
1,shopaholic review,"I don't really hate this book--a star rating had to be chosen. It just isn't anything that interests me, a purchase mistake. Fay"
3,Not in love,"I admit to reading books I'm not in love with, and this line is one of them. It's good, but not awesome. The best part is the character development, which carries the novel, but some of the events that were supposed to be hilarious aren't all that funny. But still, I recommend it because I am obviously in a minority!"
3,Would not read the rest if that character is in there....,"Sigh! Yes, I finished it. Yes, I had fun reading it in general because of Sophie's writing. But the truth is, I found the heroine a horror. Everything about her rankled me and annoyed my sense of decency. A liar, a charlatan, a fraud, she never got over any of it, even in the end. How does someone like that rate? As much fun as I had reading this book because of Kinsella's style, I found the heroine someone I could never befriend on any level.The thought of looking into someone check book out of curiosity left me not only uncomfortable, but disgusted. I felt she lost all respect and any redeeming qualities.Unfortunately, I would not read the rest of the books. I love Kinsella's light-hearted writing but not this character."
3,How dumb can you be?,"I read all of Sophie Kinsella's books except for the shopaholic series... and after reading this one, I am not going to read more shopaholic books. I love Kinsella's style of writting and I do recommend all her other books. But she made the character in this book way too dumb. It took me a while to finish the book because I got frustrated with the character not being able to solve her problems and making it a lot worst... and then all of a sudden she is smart again and everything is going well. I guess it didnt help that I watched the movie and it was a bad movie."
3,Fast and Frothy,"This is a fast and fun read, but 5 stars?? Uh... no! and believe me I'm a gal that can appreciate a great pair of shoes as much as the next. This is the type of book you can finish in a couple hours while your lolling around. It's amusing and predicatable, not quite as funny as Bridget though. I actually began to think Rebecca's ""holism"" was bordering on the pathological, she really seemed to require some professional help! How convenient that the girl who's in debt up to her eyeballs, has not one but two of the richest men in England vying for her affections! Don't take this one too seriously and you likely will enjoy."
4,"Fun, Light, Entertaining....................................","Meet Rebecca Bloomwood, a financial journalist and professional shopper. Rebecca's never met a sale she didn't like, nor a purchase she couldn't rationalize making. She's able to blithely stumble her way through both her professional and personal life--ignoring her finances, tossing letters from both her bank and the credit card companies into the ""skip"" (""it's not my fault if I never got them, is it?""); and accomplishing just enough in her work environment to get by, finding it all incredibly boring. As a result, she is not at all taken seriously on the financial circuit....; and then something happens that is very serious, and forces Becky to take serious stock of both her professional and personal life--and eventually forces her to heed her own advice.This novel was a joy to read....and many the compulsive shopper will certainly be able to relate to the loveable albeit flaky Becky Bloomwood."
4,Are you not surprised??,"This book was absolutely entertaining...entrancing...hypnotic...familiar...embarassing...hilarious...revealing...conspiratory... decadent and properly vengful! An easy, but fulfilling 'must read' - if you enjoy shopping in the slightest, invest your shopping dollars into this series...an empty shell with fulfilling insides!"
2,I know I should laugh but it was depressing,"I can see the author is trying to be cute and funny, but it's not actually funny. I mean, it's funny at first, but then after awhile it starts to feel like a 'madcap comedy about a bumbling addict trying to score some blow, while running into zany predicaments, with unpredictable and hilarious results!' Yeah, not actually funny... she's so out of control with her purchases, and even when she starts to figure it out she doesn't take it seriously.Good news? It made me take a good hard look at my own finances and see that rationalizations about sales and discounts are just that, rationalizations. Hopefully shopaholic was depressing enough that I might think of her when I shop. So... morality tale instead of chicklit, not exactly what I was looking for. But I guess it works."
5,Absolutely Shop-a-rific,"I loved it! At first I had my doubts about the book but once getting into it and knowing the characters and most importantly Becky. You grow to love it! Page by page something fun and interesting happens and it all concerns Becky. Whether you like to shop or not, this book is the perfect buy!Happy Reading!"
1,Get real...,"By the time I got to the Chapter where Becky honestly thought she was going to win the lottery and have it solve all her financial problems, I began to wonder what level of intelligence the audience who made this book a best-seller had? Then I began to wonder what kind of intelligence I had to borrow it from a friend and begin to read it. That situation wasn't funny. It was downright annoying. So much so that even though I assumed this book was supposed to be a fun and carefree read, I was getting more and more ansty as I read on. Half way through, I slammed it shut with disgust.The character of Becky is annoying, pety, frivolous, irritating and takes the word stupid and naive to a whole new level. I can't believe that women in the world can relate to her. If that's the case, I don't hold out much hope for our gender's future.If you want smart sarcastic chick-lit humour with women who have a brain, go read a Karen Templeton or Sarah Mlynowski book. Save your money on this one..."
3,shopaholic snoozer,"this is my first ""sophie"" book. i found it hard to get into the book until the halfway through it. Rebecca can be very irritating. her dishonesty was frustrating as well as her immaturity but her desire to shop is what bonded us! overall it was entertaining and i guess thats what its supposed to be about."
5,Confessions of another Shopaholic,"I am a ""shopaholic"" and at first, Becky reminded me of myself when I was first given the opportunity to have a credit card...and it spiraled from there! This book is so cute and fun and the fact that I related to it so well, made it even more fun to read. I have the next two Shopaholics and can't wait to get started!I'd definitely recommend this book."
5,Confessions of a Shopaholic,"This book was great. I found it hard to put down; I would start reading a page and by the time I would look up, I would realize I made my way through four or five chapters. I considered myself to be a shopaholic, but now I feel less guilty for it because I've never found myself in debt because of my bad habit. It's funny, has a little romance and some seriousness to it. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys to spend money for the sake of spending money."
4,I am not as bad as this,"Becky makes me feel a little less troubled. Her shopping is out of control! This book is great if you have this problem. Of course, its got a happy ending, but it depressed me to have finished it!"
2,Dreadful,"I liked Sophie Kinsella's ""Can you Keep a Secret"" as a matter of fact, I LOVED IT!but... this book was only a great disappointment... perhaps if i had read shopaholic before secret...I don't think anyone who is truly responsible with their money can stand the character, let's just say i'm not going to continue reading the other books... nothing in it happens, just her spending money and irresponsibly not thinking about all the bills she isn't paying... it's funny for the first few chapters but then... a great bore."
1,stupid book,"Sorry I bought this book. It's not worth the time reading. Quit 1/2 way thro it. The character is so stupid, and irresponsible. I like like-hearted books, but not this one."
2,Same old same old,"I read ""can you keep a secret"" first & I liked it, which is why I checked out all her other books. I managed to finish ""Confessions of a Shopaholic"" & moved on to ""Shopaholic takes Manhattan"" & I couldn't make myself go beyond 20 pages! It's the same old same old... Becky is such a stupid girl who has no idea of her finances & has no self-discipline. She's plain dumb. She also bears resemblence the main character in ""can you keep a secret"".I much prefer ""Devil wears Prada"" & ""Second Assistant""."
4,"Funny, and uplifting...","Just when you think life is going to kick you, or Becky Bloomwood, while you're down, something changes. Following the mishandled finances of Miss Bloomwood is a hilarious escapade. Though it took me a little while to become involved in the story, once I was, I couldn't put it down! If you have ever buyed something impulsively, you will definitely understand this character. Through all of the different trials and tribulations, through denial, and then self-realisation, you follow the witty Miss Bloomwood.If you are interested in a light-hearted piece, this is the one for you. I haven't laughed as much with a book since Bridget Jones's Diary. Confessions, is another work of British comedic genius!"
1,Oh so annoying,"I've nothing against a light summer read...and that is what I'd hoped for when I picked up this book. Unfortunately the 'heroine' is repugnant to the point where I was actually unhappy that things worked out for her in the end. She showed no true remorse for her lies, schemes and immaturity; so I wasn't routing for her to overcome them. Also, the 'turnaround' in her career was at best happenstance...and so preposterous and unbelievable. So, I think I can sum up my review in a single word which reflects the amount of thought and creativity that went into writing this fiction: BOO."
1,overrated...,"This book was frustrating to read at times because the main character is unbelievably stupid and not realistic.from a literary view, this book wasn't that great; and forgettable."
2,"Great book, but totally not like the movie","I read the book before the movie came out and absolutely loved it! The only reason I give it 2 stars is that being this book is a ""movie tie-in"" makes may lead people to believe that this book is like the movie. Well, it's not.If you want a fun read, this is a great book. If you read the book and expect the same story line from the movie or vice versa, you'll be greatly disappointed. The book and the movie, kept separate, are each very entertaining. Tied in? No."
5,You MUST read this book,I've read this book twice now and every time I find myself enjoying it more and more. What woman hasn't at one time or another found herself in Becky Bloomwood's position? There's a shopaholic in all of us even if we aren't quite as obsessed as Becky is. You'll find yourself laughing as she manages her way through new situations at every turn of the page and wondering just what she will do next! This is a must read.
4,It took me awhile to get into it...,"but once I did, I really enjoyed it. I think it had a little too much about her and her spending, but then again, that's the whole premise for the series I guess. I would have enjoyed more flirting between her and Luke earlier on in the book, but the ending made up for it all!"
4,If you like to shop this is a MUST READ!,"Meet Becky and her shopping problem. She has a job working for a financial magazine that she doesn't enjoy and it doesn't even come close to paying off her shopping expenses. Yes, she is a little too materialistic, but everyone has times where they just HAVE TO HAVE those new pair of shoes (or whatever you like). Becky just likes everything that's sold... She's insanely in debt, but finally is able to land herself a gig as a financial advisor to a talkshow. You'll never guess who she tells off to get it either!It took a little while to get into this book, but all the letters you get to read from different debt collectors are a riot! Stick with the book and you're going to love it!"
2,love and hate,"Unless you read this as total fiction, or you have no sense of decency, you'll absolutely loathe the main character. Becky starts out being kinda funny with all her justifications. She does try to be nice, but at her core, she's vacuous and self-centred: only child, presumably shielded from having to learn from her mistakes in youth, she just keeps doing stupid things. If you read it a bit at a time, it doesn't get too much, and you can feel sorry for her and kinda like her. If you read this book quickly or in big chunks, you'll just end up thinking that she's an enormous jerk who deserves to be sent to prison and beaten to death with an inexpensive plimsole for having no sense of responsibility, no sense that she's making other peoples' lives harder, utter arrogance, and utter lack of remorse. If you knew her in real life, you'd want to push her off a building, but if you look at her as a characature, she's more bearable."
4,Fun Read!,"I read Shopaholic Takes Manhatten first, then this one. Both were great. You love Rebecca and think ""what a dummy"" at the same time, but the story is definitely entertaining and a great read."
5,Loved it!!,"I loved this book! I, like many others, stayed up late to finish it! I read this one and ""Shopaholic takes Manhattan"" in less than a week! I am reading ""Shopaholic Ties the Knot"" now and love it, too. They are all great. I am addicted to these books. I hope that Kinsella continues this series. Excellent!!"
5,A shopaholic in all of us,"Just seeing the title of this book, I couldn't resist, being a shopaholic myself. I loved reading about Becky's crazy adventures and shopping debts, and how she manages to get them resolved in the end before it's all too late. The bank letters were intrestings. It's filled with humor and friendship. Definitely reccommend."
5,Great fun book!,"Shopaholic was an amazingly enjoyable read. The story's heroine was so absolutely ridiculous that I had to laugh. In all honesty, I can very much relate to her shopping addiction and I found my self thinking, ""I do the same thing!"" when she tried to rationalize making expensive and unnecessary purchases. This is a smart and funny book that will make you want to pull an all-nighter to finish."
3,Add Half a Star to This...,"This is one of those fun, quick reads that you need after reading really heavy books by Thomas Hardy. It's not the pinnacle of literary achievement; however, I don't believe it was trying to be. It's exactly what it should be--a fun diversion. Although I couldn't quite identify with Becky's spending habits, I thought they were hilarious. But the best thing of this book is that Becky does grow up--not leaps and bounds, but a couple realistic steps towards being a better person. I'm looking forward to reading the two follow-up books."
5,LOVED it!,"don't let the name of this book fool you. it ISN'T all about shopping. granted it is based around becky's incredible ability to spend $ she doesn't have and dig herself in a rather huge hole but it isn't entirely what the book is about. yes shopaholics every where will LOVE this book, but there are us frugal ppl who find it incredibly enjoyable as well. i enjoyed this book so much that i read it in 2 sittings and immideately picked up the second one in the series after i was done. i just couldn't wait to find out what becky was going to do next. it took me a few more sittings to finish the last one simply b/c i didn't want the series to end!"
3,oh puhlease!,OMG!Could this girl be any dumber? She Bullsh*t's her way through life. She lies to everyone she knows even her best friend. She is in debt so much that she can't figure out how to fix it. Then by some stoke of luck her life turns around and everything ends up peachy. Things like that would not happen in real life.
2,Irritating and cutesy,"When you read a book that's presented in the first person, that character should be likeable, to entice you to read the book through. Not only was I annoyed pretty much the whole time with Rebecca (lying and being terribly irresponsible), the book in itself was junk. Halfway through, I started skimming the pages for some meaningful action, and was thoroughly disappointed at the end because, even though what she fell into was pure luck, this book does NOT teach a valuable lesson that it should: If you work, you will get rewarded. This character was a fraud and very uninspiring to us all."
2,"Annoying, At Best....","Oh my....this was a disappointing read! The main character, Rebecca, is so shallow and clueless that I wanted her to suffer bankruptcy and to be thrown into prison. Her answer to her obsession with shopping and overspending is to get a job in a retail store on the weekends....hello?!?! I bet you can't guess what happens next, right? Although she can't bear to open her late payment notices, she becomes a financial wiz on a local television news show....and gets the guy....PLEASE!!!!The end of this book was also predictable, but was the only thing that justified my reading it. Don't waste your money on this one!!"
1,yawn,"This book is very similar (read: derivative) to Bridget Jones' Diary. The main character is an idiot. Though Kinsella explores how ""shopaholics"" rationalize their purchases, she ties the ending up in a nice little bow where the heroine still has her cute buying habit. This book is completely predictable and boring. I would have not read past page 15 if I didn't want to feel like money was wasted on this. If you are looking for trite chick-lit with an unrealistically happy ending, go on ahead."
4,My Little Dream,"As a student and a worker I know first hand what living in debt is like... frightening yet somehow forgettable. As long as the bills get thrown out, misplaced, or incinerated, they magically never existed at all. I cannot say that I have ever been guilty of committing such acts of irresponsibility, but that's not to say I haven't been tempted (try every time the post comes). This is a book to give hope to all of us dreaming of winning the lottery, discovering a rich aunt we never knew existed has left us fortune, or marrying an extremely wealthy (and Brad Pittish) fellow who will take care of any debt I have accumulated plus buy me that brand new Jetta I've had my eye on. Sigh. Anyway, I've read the thing twice now simply for the main character's silly attempts to avoid her debtors. Truly unbelievable. And though the ending may seem a little implausible, isn't that the point of a daydream?"
4,This book is V. Bridgetish!,"Love Bridget Jones? Well let me tell you, you'll love this book! V. similar writing style, big laughs and alot of fun!"
5,Some Hilarious Stuff,"This book was the funnest book I have ever read in my entire life~! When I first saw this book in the bookstore, it caught my attention immediately and thus I decided to buy it. Was that smart~! Once I read the first few lines I knew that I was going to love this book. Once you start you can't stop. Seriously~! Sohpie Kinsella is such a brilliant writer and the book literally brightens up your day. It's packed with some hilarious stuff and at times I just had to call up my best friend to read her some excerpts from the book~ I recommend this book to anybody who wants a good laugh...actually I recommend this book to EVERYBODY whether you want a good laugh or not~!!!!"
4,"Read it, enjoyed it","I got it two days ago and finished it in two days. I couldn't believe anyone could get into such a situation, but I guess there are some people. It was creativly written and funny. But I wasn't to fond of the ending... it was something I expected to happen."
4,Shopaholics Unite!,"Ok, never been quite as bad as this gal, but can relate.Great book. Easy read. Nice, strong, intelligent female character that I think most women can relate to even if you aren't a true shopaholic.Read Bridget Jones and would put this one right up in the same category. Not nearly as funny as Bridget, but still a great book."
4,Suprisingly Good,"I don't know what Helen Fielding has started, but it seems to be big. Since Bridget Jones came out there seem to be a mulititude of ... knock-offs like Jemima J and Getting Over It. So, when my roommate gave me Confessions of a Shopaholic I was pretty sure it would be another lame attempt at the Brit Chick genre. I actually thought that it would be the worst one yet since it dealt with something as trivial as shopping. However, I have to admit that Sophie Kinsella really suprised me with this one. It was actually funny! At times Becky was a bit too much with her pathological lying, but Kinsella was still able to make her likeable. It doesn't quite top Bridget Jones, but it is certainly comparable in the amount of enjoyment I had reading it."
4,Terrific,"Shopping loves company, and I guess I'm a fellow shopaholic who enjoyed reading about the shopping exploits of another shopaholic, although fictionalized. Not quite 5 stars because it was a little long in some parts that I had to skip through the pages. Light and fluffy fare."
3,"I expected fluff, and that's what I got!",This is a pure fluff book - something I needed in between serious books and studying. You cannot take anything in this book too seriously or you might blow your brains out.
2,I don't get the hype,"After finish reading this book, I have a hard time understanding why it is so highly rated. The book is an easy read, and funny at times. However, the main character was so poorly constructed that she appeared dillusional and stupid. What bothered me the most was that she lied almost all the time! There was no transition from the shopaholic Rebecca to the... sort of put together Rebecca(she's definitely not recovered)at the end. Even her romance seemed abrupt, I couldn't feel any chemistry there. I am so disappointed, I am not going to read any other books in the series."
1,Like listening in on a spazz's internal dialogue,"Kinsella's novel starts off with a series of letters and delves into the superficial and self-absorbed shallow pool of Rebecca's thoughts. Without even reading the whole book the plot promised to be forumlaic and predictable. I couldn't get past the second chapter. This book is absolute rubbish - nothing more than the literary version on inane teenage chatter. The author goes into exhaustive detail on Rebecca's shopping obsession to build up a mini internal-conflict. For me, it wasn't at all rapturous. After a few more pages I didn't care whether she got the scarf or not. The prose is far short of witty, charming or even cute and instead stumbles on into insipid.Reading this book probably dropped my IQ a few points."
4,So Funny!,"What a fun book! Better than Bridget Jones, so much more related to real life. What woman hasn't shopped her heart out, or craved a piece of designer clothing (or an accessory) and bought it regardless of the financial consequences?! Becky is a great character, very honest and funny. The inner dialogues she has with herself when rationalizing her purchases (or any other blunder for that matter) echos those of myself and my girlfriends every time we visit the shops. I've passed this book on to several friends and they've all laughed out loud as I did when I read it. It's a great summer read, have fun!"
4,Fun Easy Read - Now Addicted,"I too was thinking this book would not live up to the hype. One third of the way into the book I was hoping there would be more to the book than someone charging her credit card every 10 minutes. Two thirds of the way into the book I was thinking this is cute, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone over 33. And in the final third I was hooked. I have bought two others from the Shopaholic series and can't put them down. I hope you enjoy this as much as I have."
3,I kept waiting for the ... to happen.,"Kinsella writes beautifully. Her book is a quick and easy read. My complaints are a result of staying up into the wee hours of the night to read this book with the thought that she was going to get into some real drama and fantastic fun. To my disappointment, there wasn't any. I kept reading with hopes that something marvelously profound was going to happen and in the end, it all just seemed to be a love story that had a happy ending. However, if this is your kind of thing than by all means read this book. But beware...from one true shopalholic to another...it's a disgrace that she calls herself a shopalholic at all."
4,Made me want to shop!,"Although Becky is a completely neurotic ditzy character, she's actually quite charming and good at math. In fact, she annoyed me at first but grew on me midway. I started really liking her. She reminds me of a modern young Lucy from ""I Love Lucy"". Every situation and thought process is a perfect recipe for disaster and quite hilarious. I found myself chuckling and giggling out loud in public several times, just couldn't help it. Sophie Kinsella has a knack for writing sitcom. Although this book is ficiton, I found it to be a little bit of a self-help book. I think many people can relate to Becky's addiction in minor and major ways. I did, and glad to see that she pulled out of her situation by becoming self-made. Cute, witty, and fun to read...I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series about Ms. Bloomwood."
3,Just Okay,"I was disappointed in this book, mostly because I could not connect to the main character. Rebecca to me, is an unsympathic character. She lies to everyone around her while getting further and further into debt. She does nothing to help her situation. She tries, but then she goes right back to her old ways. I just didn't see the point of the story-at the end she still does not seem to get it-very disappointing. I am a fan of Sophie Kinsella, but I think I will skip the Shopaholic series."
4,Hilarious Fluff,"It's chick lit, absolutely. A great funny escape. No profound insights or deep thoughts to be had here, but plenty of humour and entertainment; I have re-read it more than once and it still makes me laugh."
2,Shallow with no growth.,"I thought I'd like this book. It started out reasonably, with a sweet main character who loves shopping but has debt issues. It's written well, I had no problem with the prose.Spoiler---I just kept waiting for her to change, to learn from her bad behavior. To NOT buy every single material thing she feels like. Instead she has her just manage to get more money so she can buy to her heart's content. It was disappointing. This character has actual problems, people who are this extreme and willing to jeopardise their real lives to buy expensive clothes have an addiction to shopping and need to address it.I finished to see if she'd learn anything at all, but I wish I hadn't wasted my time."
5,FUNNY! HILARIOUS! LOVEABLE! ADDICTIVE!,"This is the first book that I've ever had the desire to re-read! Very funny, light and addictive. Charming and never dull. A great read!"
2,Not Bridget - Not Even Close,"I read all of Helen Fieldings books in a matter of days and was in search of something of the same caliber. Well, this is a very similar story but it is NOT the same caliber of writing. I found the first 150 pgs of the book to be a little ""ho hum"" and frustrating. For 150 pgs the book dwells on her addiction to shopping, but you know she has to overcome it - that's the whole point of the book, right? So you read and wait - serious overkill detailing her addiction - and wait... Finally she hits bottom (3/4 of the way through the book), starts to pull it together, and love is added to the mix. The love story comes too late and ends too abruptly. The rest of the book's underweavings never come to a conclusion. When I finally started liking the book - it was over. I was left unsatisfied and wanting a complete conclusion. Read Helen Fielding's books - enjoy Bridget Jones (or Cause Celeb for something different) and save your money on this one."
2,Not sure I read the same book,"I love to shop as much as the next gal, but the main character in this book was simply ridiculous. She was incredibly irresponsible. Dealing with stress and problems by spending money she really didn't have, then hoping some rich man would swoop in and save her?! Please. Like young women don't already have enough enough difficulty being independent and respected?! Grow up already. Readers should grow up too, and stop encouraging this sexist drivel.Very disappointing."
1,disappointing...,"I bought this as a book on tape (the unabridged version) for a long car ride. I've read several of Kinsella's other books & was a huge fan so I decided to try the Shopaholic series out. I could not stand it! Rebecca is such a delusional, irresponsible, selfish girl that I could not enjoy her. I really wanted to like her, but as the book went on, she just annoyed me. I found myself yelling at my car stereo for her - DON'T BUY IT or WHY DID YOU DO THAT YOU NINNY? I can't believe this book got so many good reviews. The main character was so unlikable that when the book ended I was very perturbed that she never got her comeuppance. I can't believe the girl acted like an immature moron the whole time, avoiding all her problems & then gets rewarded with the dream job, the rich boyfriend, and never really has to suffer any consequences! I am so mad I spent money on this."
2,I guess I'm not a shopaholic,"I ordered this when it went on sale thinking that it was a great bargain. I think at $0.99 I may have overpaid. I didn't find it to be that good of a read, with the exception of the last few chapters when the main character is finally figuring things out. I found Rebecca to be a frustrating character, but then I don't have a passion for the newest, most expensive clothes, nor do I max out my credit cards without being able to make the payments.All-in-all, it was just ok. I wouldn't read it again though, nor will I bother with the rest of the series."
2,Inmature,"After so much hype I was really disappointed in this book. It had some entertaining parts, but the main character was so self absorbed and immature I found her more annoying than likeable. Even the relationship between her and Luke was based on nothing, her attraction was his money, but really what did he see in her except possibly the attractive package."
1,very disappointing,"I am very disappointed by this book, especially since it was supposedly so good as to be made into a movie. The character is extremely unlikeable, not only do her actions ruin her own life but they hurt other people's too. Like the issue with her parents neighbors, which I find irresponsible and disrespectful. It reminds me of those movies where you cringe watching the main character make a complete fool of themself because you can see it coming a mile away. She's one major disaster after another. I'm about 3/4ths of the way done and just put it down because it was so depressing, but since I have it I'm finishing with the hopes this girl gets a clue and the book gets much better!!"
4,Buy this book!,"This is the first novel by Sophie Kinsella that I've ever read, and it certainly won't be the last. If you enjoy author Marian Keyes, then this book will definetly be an enjoyable read. It was almost scary how much I had in common with Rebecca, and I coudln't help laughing because I know we've all been in her shoes at some point. Very entertaining and nicely written."
4,LOVED IT,"I LOVED this book. Happened to pick it up on a whim and was delightfully surprised. I could not put the book down. I laughed OUT LOUD on a five hour flight full of business types. I was quite embarassed but could not- would not put the book down. I rushed to pass the book on to my family, collect it and pass it on again so that everyone could enjoy Becky's antics."
5,Shopaholic Anonymous,"This book is great for anyone that knows the trials and tribulations of being addicted to shopping! Reading this book made me aware that I am not alone...even if she lives all the way on the other side of the world! Shopping is the same everywhere! My favorite line: ""Everyone would be so much happier if they could just wear a new outfit everyday."" So true!!"
2,Left me cold,"Maybe I'm just out of touch with modern society. Maybe I'm too much in touch, and our heroine's credit problems strike too close to home. At any rate, I just could not get interested in this book, in Becky Bloomwood and her problems, or in any of the other characters in the story. Conspicuous consumption is not funny. Going hopelessly into debt so that you can buy more stuff you don't need is not funny."
2,"A promising start, but...","This book started out well enough, with a lot of funny and laugh inducing introspections on the heroine's part. I couldn't help but identify with the heroine in her constant need to shop and her obsession with designer brands. However, about halfway through the book, the heroine's antics becomes grating and extremely annoying. Not only is she completely lacking in self-control, she's also immature and irresponsible, running and hiding from her creditors instead of looking for a solution out of her financial dilemma. Despite the author's efforts to paint her as a very spunky and imaginative person, everything that has happened to her comes from good luck instead of any hard work on her part to change her circumstances. It made the whole story extremely hard to swallow for me. Needless to say, I won't be standing in line to buy the rest of the book in this series."
2,The character bothered me,"I was excited about reading this book, having thoroughly enjoyed Bridget Jones Diary as well as the Edge of Reason. Around the 3rd chapter of this book, I had already constructed in my mind what would probably happen in this book...and it did. The predictability of the book bored me to tears as well as the characaters lack of any morals or self-control. Sophie Kinsella could have given the character at least a small amount of intelligence or ambition. She cared nothing about her career or herself as a person."
