1,Horrible!,"The first section of the book was okay but once I started reading the second section I was appalled by the historical fallacies she wrote! I could barely finish the book. Things that took thousands to millions of years to happen she wrote as happening over night. I know that she is supposed to be an educated writer, so I was shocked to read parts of this book. I would not recommend this book to true historical fiction readers!"
3,A mite disappointing,"First let me qualify the disappointing statement. I ordered the book when I actually meant to order another with a similar title....lots of Circle (s) and Stone (s) in titles out there.But furthermore, I found this to be only fair an imitation of the Auel Ayla series of books, (Clan of the Cave Bear, et al). Mom gets killed falling into a crack in the earth/ flash flood in a river......etc and more.It's an OK read, and if I had actually meant to order this one instead of another ""Circle"" book it might have even been moresatisfying.I'm going to have to give it a 3 out of 5."
1,I couldn't even finish the book,"In the beginning It felt like I was reading about a group of apes. And it was freaky how she started this strange cult that worshipped The Mother. I read only enough to say I read it and quickly skimmed the last 1/3 or so to see if it was leading up to somthing. Nothing like the book, Clan of the Cave Bear."
5,Latin Jazz Supreme,"I'm a big fan and collector of Poncho Sanchez and his Latin Jazz band. I believe this is his best effort in several years. Good mix of Salsa and Blues. You can't miss on this one..........it makes you ""move""!!!"
4,Raise Your Hand,Very good job by the Master Congero. He's was able to put together a very a good balance between soul music and his bread butter Latin Music
5,Hi Quality Latin Jazz Salsa & Rhytm & Blues,The video review made the choice for the 'Raise your hand'CD easier. Beside this Poncho Sanchez is one of my great Latin Facvorite artist. I was really surprising that Andy Montanez has an tribute to this album. And thats my salsa favorite artist with a great voice. This album has a wide range of music styles. I love it.
4,MiamiBeach,"This is a great product. Great price and easy to use. I really love to buy using Amazon because they have a great products, great prices and the follow up is is amazing...."
2,Good reading but exhaustive,I am sure people who are interested in the American history of the latter part of the 19th century will find this book useful.
2,Worth Reading But With Caveats,"Reading this book is liking going to a ball game to root for the home team; they lose the game but you had a good time anyway. I enjoyed the concept of a dual biography and tracing the movements of the two presidents during the Civil War years. But, after piecing together the facts, Chadwick doesn't add much depth as a writer or historian. He had an interesting game plan, but poor execution. Depending on the reader's level of Civil War study, there may be enough here to ignite an interest to read more. (It does have a great bibliography.) If you do pick up the book, be prepared for an annoying amount of misplaced facts, mistakes, and repetitive information. This book screams for an editor which it seems the publisher never provided."
1,A great IDEA for a book.,"A parallel life of the two great antagonists of the Civil War ought to make for an exciting book. Unfortunatly, this is not it. This project cried out for someone with the gifts andd insights of a Plutarch..or a Shelby Foote. unfortunatly, the resulting text is turgid, wooden, and lacking in philosophical depth. The struggle between Lincoln and Davis was a a struggle of Philosophies and of spiritual ideals, a clash between rival understandings of America, and even of the human condition. However, that is conveyed in this well intentioned, but flawed volume."
4,smith3675,"The product does everything it claims. However, they could have spent a few more hours and bucks working on the instruction manual, adding another LED to actually let you know the product is active when you hit the on button (because of the slight lag time between functions), not to mention adding a key pad to the top of the device. It took way to long to figure out how to set up this simple device, a couple of extra hints in the instruction manual would be of help, like: video output is on video one, etc. All in all the device is great once you've figure it out. The only items which keeps me from rating this device as the next best thing to sliced bread is the instruction manual and the lack of a attached keypad to the top of the device."
5,Very Fun 5 Thumbs up!,"This is amazing! When i bought this it changed the value of my psp and psp 1 GB mem. stick. It went from 300$ To 300,000$ in my mind. Now anything thats on t.v. i can watch on my psp. It also works an our comcast digital cable box, Satellite dishes, Tivo,Tv, Xbox, Ps2,Xbox 360 and any thing with the standard yellow cord in red cord in and white cord input it will work with. You simply pop you Memory Stick Duo and press rec. and it will record anything on your t.v screen, from you playing video games or watching the simpsons,Desperate Houswives,South park and Many other shows. Hint:you should have at least a 512 MB mem stick or else you wont get much use out of it"
5,Awesome Device,"I had bought this blindly on a impulse buy at Comp USA's closing. Neuros has delivered in abundance. You can used any flash media to convert old VHS, DVD's or record you favorite TV shows. I travel and plan on using it to record and watch programes on the road. I don't have to convert to and format to play on a iPod and I can choose the resolution. I have converted over 80 VHS movies in the past month since I purchased it. All play quite well on TV, Computer, Palm Pilot, and iPod.It is also so small. I used it to convert a famous beer movie take it to a German Bar and play the movie on the HDTV there flawlessly. I tuck the recorder in the ceiling tiles and everyone had a good time."
4,Good user interface,"Purchased this item because we wanted a solid State (flash memory based) video recorder. We've got the Sandisk V recorder first but it was a cut out product and required firmware update. Sandisk's recorder ended up still being hard to use and unreliable. This one works as advertised. It is plug and play. Like the other reviewer said, the on screen control is easier to use and the preview of what's being recorded makes more sense. The only thing I'd wish is Amazon to have the Recorder 2+ product because this one uses CF card or Memory Stick (which is a dieing standard)."
4,"Great for YouTube, So-So Otherwise","I bought this product intending to use it to capture video from various sources that I could then edit and put on youtube and other video sharing sites. For that purpose, it works very well.However, don't expect anything near DVD quality capture here. This thing was designed for recording video optimized for small-screen viewing.Also, the passed-thru AV signal to your TV, even when not recording, has the same low image quality as the recorded footage. The remote is also tricky to use and if you lose it, the Neuros Recorder itself becomes 100% useless; you can't even turn it on without the remote.Despite it's limits, for only $100, it's a pretty handy little gadget. It can definitely be improved and I eagerly await future models."
3,Bit of a headache,"Unfortunately, this item only has input/output to RCA so I had to do a lot of rewiring just to get it up and running. The menus are very confusing, the manual isn't much help. A quick guide would have been nice. The picture quality is very grainy on the television, but I'm sure it will be fine on my PSP"
2,technical flaws,"Track 11 is cut short mid sentence at 56 seconds, one of the unforgivable technical flaws to blemish the entire fine work.It is evident that the performance of L'Olimpiade here was like a beautiful bouquet of roses. unfortinately it was edited and pressed to cd by a lawn mower.It is unfortunate that OPUS111 neglegted to even listen to the master before sending it to press.edit - In retrospect, I am still surprised with these flaws and still feel they demand a re-issue of this CD. If you buy the 4 seasons, you expect to receive all 4 seasons and not 3 and 3/4 seasons with ""Winter"" cut short 50 seconds into the first movement. If the track was recitative It could be more easily overlooked (like the several other cue errors in this release), but that is not the case. The obvious hatchet job was ignored and pushed out to press when it should never have been so. It should be corrected and re-released."
3,"good facts, not so great animation",with the exception of the shoddy animation this was very factual. also offers many points of view from several palentologists. just don't expect BBC dinosaur special quality animation
4,Interesting,"As with any documentary on the prehistoric world, you have to use the term documentary a bit loosely as there really are so fewhard facts to go on. Still, they have done a pretty good job of making it both informative and entertaining.The show presents some of the stranger critters from the prehistoric world along with some ideas (best guess mostly) as to whythey turned out the way they did.Interesting, entertaining, and your kids will love it."
3,Interesting,"Interesting. Not ""walking with"" by any stretch of the imagination but an interesting look none the less at dinosaurs that are not generally walked with. Worth a look."
3,never knew about that,there was alot of info I didnt know about the Dinosaurs not even the fins were for attracting the opposite sex
5,A fascinating collection of essays . . .,"A fascinating collection of essays that reveals, often in unexpected ways, the effects of the Irish famine on both sides of the Atlantic. Ranging from the loss of life to the loss of music among the Irish peasantry, from the pages of the Dublin University Magazine to the pages of American newspapers, from Chef Alex Soyer's famine soup to the famine graves at Grosse Ile, from Irish memory to Irish American rage, this scholarly but readable book provides us with the broadest understanding of this far-reaching event. (William H. A. Williams, author of 'Twas Only an Irishman's Dream)"
2,Pleasantly dull.,"Sorry, but I was quite disappointed in this cd, given the caliber of the performers. I found it pleasantly dull and will most likely trade it in for something else."
4,Fun for all ages,"Funny toy for all ages ...especially The Simpsons fans. Pen works great and sound is very clear ... It's fun to use it during international teleconferences ... i always like to play following sentences : ""I didn't do it"" or ""I'll get back to you"" :-) cheers to all Simpsons fans !!!"
2,not what i expected,Not what I expected at all. The Velcro handle spins around the rod making it very difficult and very annoying. I am not happy with these product.
5,Great Mattress and Awesome Price,"I did a lot of searching before and after I found this mattress. The grandbaby has back issues, and this mattress is perfect for him. He is sleeping soundly and comfortably. Other places had the same type or quality of mattress, but the cost was soooo much higher. So glad I found Amazon.com"
4,Very good quality for the price,"For the price I was very impressed and my son didn't know the difference between this mattress (which was for the inlaws' house) and his organic, fancy $200 mattress we have at home...we got an organic cotton cover for it just in case the materials in this were not chemical-free."
5,Good deal!!!,This is a good deal $$$. We are using the mattress for our son's new toddler big boy bed. He seems to sleep on it very well when he isn't jumping on it. It's holding up quite nicely. I would recommend to a friend.
2,Not Firm.,"I've had this crib mattress for 18 months, since my daughter was born. It's held up fine, but I wanted to make sure anyone looking to order this mattress knows that it is not firm at all. I am expecting again and will need another crib mattress for this child and I would not purchase this one again."
4,works great,"This mattress fit my daughters grayco lauren crib perfectly, the build quality seemed good and my daughter seemed to sleep well on it, this is my first child mattress purchase and i am very satisfide with it, it shipped quickly in a giant cardbord box"
3,Good product,I'm satisfied about the thickness and the hardness of the mattress but it's coated with plastic and personally I don't like that. It's a good item anyway
3,Gil's comeback.,"Everybody who liked ""Round 'n round"" and ""Never giving up now"" will also like this one. it's a nice soft-rock song.A pity that his comeback flopped in Germany and Austria because this song is really nice. It just gets annoying when you hear it too often. and the five versions on this Cd sound all very similar."
3,Complete Unit ?,"Buyer be advised that you will need a mandrel for this hole saw...and finding a mandrel, here locally, that fit was a real challenge for me. When I ordered the mandrel, I foolishly though my ""inhand mandrel"" would fit this unit. Wrong. Be advised different mandrels fit different hole saws, they are proprietory. Once I did find a mandrel that would work with this hole saw, it worked fine for drilling a door's lock assembly's holes."
4,Great resource,As an art education major this book came in handy. It is a great reference for anyone who wants to learn more about an artist as a person and as an artist. It gives short bios on many different artists from different periods through art history. It was well worth the money.
2,Not quite what I wanted,"The magnets arrived in a timely fashion. I was looking for something with a little more power, and the description (will lift up to 1/4 lb) led me to believe they would work well for my project - small refrigerator magnets. I wanted something strong enough that could hold more than one piece of paper or something a little thicker than paper - and I felt these did not work well enough. My magnets are 2 x 3 inches and light FRP material, so I thought the magnets should work. Also, they were thicker than I wanted - but that was my own fault - the dimensions were accurately portrayed."
4,Toby - Chi-Lites,"I first heard this album back in the 70's in Papua New Guinea. Loved it then - particularly the extraordinary vocals. Had to buy it on CD to add to my collection - took a couple of decades but I finally did it in 2009. My favourite tracks are :1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8"
1,not good at all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Ok but if ya ask me why my rating is one star here is your answer:1.to hard to play2.overpriced $183.not as good as nba live 2003don't buy this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Very dissapointed,I am very dissapointed with this game. I personnaly liked the new features.(slam dunk and 3 point) Those were really fun but i thought they were too easy. What also was dissapointing was the dynasty mode. It was a lot harder and more complex then last yea. this game is probaly better though.
2,drives me crazy,"I always look foward this series..but NBA 2005 didn't become any better..the difference between starter.. all star.. super star... is like..the computer always can hit, no matter how hard you defense..they always run faster than you...and all the PF or C ... are like idiots.. slow motion..ya.. the audience look better... but this game needs more effort to make it more real."
2,Disappointing,"I think B Stewart's review sums up a lot of the problems here, and I agree with what he says.My feeling is that 99 Keys was intended to be a coffee table book. The writing is pretty terrible, and the organization is even worse. The best comparison I can think of is that this is like a high school paper on Steinway -- some kid sat down with a bunch of books and did his best to distill them all in to one text. I don't think this would have been published had it not been a Steinway descendant at the helm.I'm also not a fan of the constant marketing angle. 88 keys is like a big ol' brochure; saying nothing remotely negative or even insightful.And I'm tired of the illustrations. Why is everything a drawing? Why are key illustrations left out, but some of the page is occupied by a ""timeline"" which is totally meaningless and useless.Out of all the books I've read on pianos, this is the worst."
4,the book that got the conversation started,"In this book we can see Bob Webber beginning to explore some of the issues in worship that were to become his life work. He was concerned about the way pastors dominated worship and that many ""worshipers"" were little more than passive audience members. With this book Webber got the conversation started, but he refined his ideas more and more in his later books."
5,great album,"I've been riding around for a couple of weeks listening to Parts Unknown and haven't gotten tired of it yet. As a songwriter, it's the type of music that makes you want to go home and write. I don't think you can get more direct and honest than his singing voice, and the songs are amazing. A seemingly simple ""bad man"" song like ""Roberts the Dread Outlaw"" turns out after several listens to be not so much about the outlaw- Roberts doesn't do anything but leave before anything bad happens- but about the hunger for excitement and adventure in a sleepy small town. It's much more real stuff than an outlaw story. Everything on the album is told with a knowing sense of humor. Davis is a little like John Prine, and a lot like Billy Joe Shaver. He's severely underrated and the best thing I've heard in a while."
4,Almost Perfect,"This product really expanded the usefulness of my Samsung i-700 PDA/Phone. The first week, it was a huge help in getting me into the heart of Chicago with only one wrong turn (the turns were too close together for the unit to switch fast enough!). The one small glitch I had with getting the GPS to power-up was solved with a quick phone call to Pharos, and I've had no problems since. My only grumbles have been that my PDA cannot be made to stay on more than 5 minutes, while powered; and the Ostia maps are not as detailed as Microsoft Streets & Trips. Otherwise, Great!"
2,Most Melodious! - but bad disk.,"This compilation of Bhajans sung by S. Janaki is the most melodious Meera Bhajans I have heard. Better than Lata Mungeshkar.However, the last two tracks on the CD did not play back on my computer. I thought it was a computer issue, and used a different computer and found the same. Amazon sent me a replacement and the replacement had the same issue. I used Windows Media Player, VLC and iTunes on Windows 7 and the media player on Ubuntu. I owned this CD before (the one that comes with the alternate cover - black with Meerabai on it), but lost it and wanted a replacement."
3,Short and Sweet,"I'm not much of a short-story reader since I really enjoy getting buried deep in a very long novel, but I picked this book up to keep on my treadmill for reading in 20-30 minute intervals. It worked well for that purpose. I've enjoyed many of Pilcher's gentle romantic novels. I was expecting a similar read with these short stories, but found these to be almost too soft and sweet for my tastes. There are too many similar plots. The women often have low self-esteem and need to ""find themselves"". Every story has a fairy-tale ending. So they were okay for reading on the treadmill, but these aren't great short stories."
3,Flowers in the Rain,I very much like Rosamunde Pilcher's work however I am not as taken with short story books. this book was good reading and I enjoyed it but not as much as i would a complete novel
1,The Elixers Of Nostradamus,"Cool book. Missing 18th chapter becasue of ""Moral, Christian, God Fearing reasons"" is a major bummer. I would like to read just the 18th chapter alone on psychoactive plants and entheogens rather than recipes for preserved nuts and skin whiteners."
4,"Good Reference, Hard Read","This book is great to have on your shelf, but a tough one to keep by your bed. At times it gets rather technical, and doesn't explain the practical side of things. It is a wonderful reference, you can probably find anything you'd like (at least, dated year 2000). It is not a book for people who know very little about AIDS, I'd suggest getting familiar with it all first."
4,Good but not necessery,This book was very helpful for getting ideas rolling and get me thinking about stuff i never really thought of otherwise. Its not really all that necessery though. It has lots of great ideas in it though that will get you thinking about what you could add to keep the campaign feeling rich and full of life :D
4,Quality music in traditional style,"I say ""traditional style"" as the songs are cited with ""Carter"" as writer. By her father are ""Diamonds in the Rough"", ""Meeting in the Air"" and the Carter version of ""Will the Circle Be Unbroken"". The others with the exception of ""Far Sides of Jordan"" are written or cowritten by June Carter.My favorite cuts on the album are ""Losin' You"" and ""Once Before I Die"" - but the humor in ""Gatsby's Restaurant"" and ""I Used to Be Somebody"" shows a delightful side of her work. Solid, simple music - simple in the sense of nothing but the essentials to allow the songs to stand out without distraction."
5,Less is more,"I searched for this CD after hearing on the radio a recording of Mrs. Cash singing BURNING RING OF FIRE. She was accompanied by only a zither. The other cuts are just as delightful. They are lovely folk songs, old and new, accompanied by simple American insturments."
4,"definitely an acquired taste, but beautiful","I was never an admirer of June Carter (or the Carter family for that matter) but with maturity I have come to appreciate the beauty in her singing. Her voice is certainly not pretty, but the emotion expressed in it is so moving. The version on this album of The Far Side Banks of Jordan, sung with her late husband Johnny Cash, is THE definitive version of this song. I have loved the song since the first time I heard it, and several versions are great. This one, though, with their aging voices (and the love still shining through) is incredibly beautiful. Knowing that Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash had one of the world's true great love stories and knowing that he followed her to heaven after four short months, make this version unbeatable. I never hear it without being moved to tears!"
4,"June, it is great to hear a new recording from you!","Having been slightly acquainted with the Carters, Maybelle and the girls, too many years for them to remember, I welcome this CD from June Carter Cash. I read some of the comments above and agree with most, although I believe one ""reviewer"" needs more information about the Carters.In this album June does not sound just as she did thirty plus years ago and is not supposed to. Who among us does? There are some good numbers here and certainly the overall effort brings back memories, pleasant memories.I for one will be using this CD on my radio show in Louisville, KY on a regular basis. I have many listeners who apreciate the Carter Family and welcome their music, be it the originals, Sara, A.P. and Maybelle, Maybelle and the girls or the girls individually. I play many of their earlier recordings and I will be playing this latest one.June, I hope this is a succes for you and for my part, don't wait so long, do us another one."
5,A National Treasure,"Last year I rediscovered the Carter Family. This album is a new chapter in the rich musical history of June Carter Cash and her family. There is something for everyone. The Carter family fans will enjoy the remake of ""Diamonds in the Rough"", ""Meeting in the Air"", and ""Will the Circle be Unbroken"". ""The Far Side Banks of Jordan"", a duet with husband Johnny Cash, is the premium song on this album, and although a hymn, is a wonderful love song. As June and Johnny sing to each other, you cannot help thinking about they love they feel for each other as they sing the words. June's version of ""Ring of Fire"", written by her after falling in love with Johnny, makes great listening. The talented musicians and back up vocals just put the icing on the cake. Twenty five years from now you will listen to this album, and thank your lucky stars that you added it to your collection."
1,Move On & Save Your Money,"This recording is a major disappointment. The artistic ensemble is top flight, the song selection good, and the production is fine. But it is embarrassing to listen to a singer who is so obviously past her prime. The only reason I can see for getting this CD is nostalgia. As another reviewer said, I also suggest getting Anita Carter's Ring of Fire recording. While the production is not as slick, the core of the music, the vocals, are outstanding. June Carter Cash's accomplishments are to be honored, but this CD doesn't do it for me."
4,A great traditional country recording,"June Carter Cash's Press On will remind everyone what country music used to sound like. It beats the stuffing out of the country-pop junk that's played on the radio these days (Shania Twain, Garth Brooks, et al). With restrained, tasteful accompaniment from Norman Blake, Marty Stuart, Rodney Crowell, and others, and a guest appearance by husband Johnny Cash, this is a CD to savor again and again."
1,Little or No Laughs,"If you're the type of person who's really into nasty jokes and likes the ""f"" word a lot, I recommend this movie to rent only (not buy)."
5,for greater glory,This video tells the inspiring story of the Mexican revolution of 1926. This story is not usually included in American history.Our youth would find a lot to be proud of in the suffering and endurance of the folk. Catholics in particular have a lot to be proud of. Vivo Cristo Rey!
5,Excellent little known history,"I was most impressed by this movie. As a faithful catholic I was amazed that I never heard this story before. True, faith filled members of the church not able to attend Mass and priests being martyred before their congregations; a full assault on the Catholic Church by the state. A very truthful, gruesome movie that beautifully shows what belief in Jesus really means."
3,Not for everyone,"More historical drama rather than a so-much-action movie. Held my attention, hated the ending, it really leaves you wanting more."
2,For Greater Glory,Focus is on violence . Over the top ! I do not recommend it for children to watch. Not inspiring .
2,Eva Longoria ruined it for me,"It was a film worth making. It wasn't that great, but it wasn't terrible. As a minority from South Central I felt an obligation to support it. Now I can't see it without seeing her smug face telling me who to vote for. Should an actor's personal ranting matter? Like it or not it does. I can't watch Mission Impossible for the same reason. Eva Longoria will not be getting a dime of my money."
2,Not all that great,"This movie documents a series of events that occurred in Mexico in the 1920s. Deciding that the Catholic Church was a focus of dissent, the Mexican President(dictator) cracked down on the Catholic Church. The Vatican responded by closing all church services in Mexico. A group of dissidents start an armed revolt and win a few battles in the countryside. Then, the government and Vatican come to a compromise, the reason for the revolt dies and finally the rebel force is wiped out. One of the many sad stories of government oppression and insurrection that make up such a big part of Mexican history. Very depressing."
1,Right wing propaganda,"When a movie has a critic rating of 35 and users rate it so high in Amazon you can tell there's either a lot of personal emotions on this movie or there's a campaign to improve this movie's ratings.Make no mistake this movie is BAD.This movie was made by the Mexican religious right wing (Yes, we have a very strong one) to try to justify a ""War"" between the cristeros, who started it by assassinating teachers who were trying to provide secular education to rural Mexico, and a government that handled this crisis very poorly; all ended with the help of the US who had just realized how much oil reserves were available in Mexico.Watch it if you like catholic propaganda movies, avoid it otherwise."
5,For Greater Glory-the greatest,"This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. A true story of commitment, courage, and faith. The acting is superb.And the story makes you realize how easy it is for a nation to rationalize tyranny. Get your stacks together before the movie begins-you won't want to hit the pause button!"
4,For Greater Glory,"worth waiting until it came out for me to buy. Now I have it in my library for future viewing. Great acting and most importantly very chilling to know this was left out of history books. Ummm, why was that? They were Catholics? It seems alot of huge mass murders of catholics throughout history was left out of history books."
5,For Greater Glory exceeded expectations,"A must see for anyone who treasures our religious freedoms. Big government cannot tolerate religious freedom. This movie is the true story of what happens when a government sets out to destroy religion. I lived in many countries that persecuted the religious, especially Christians, but I learned about the events in Mexico only recently, seeing the true story for the first time.The Mexican government hides that shameful history from schools and its citizens. This is actually now news in our free society in the USA.I urge you to see this film and learn from its from its recording of actual events.Dave"
3,Hard To Watch The Treatment Of The People,Closed my eyes a few times but over all a very good story we injoyed it. I learned some history I did not know.
5,"Great movie, very good adaptation.","Well made epic movie, great scenery. The actors brought the characters to life. I liked the adaptation of an episode in Mexican history that is not so widely known, maybe because the same people still run the country."
4,For Greater glory,I cried a lot but it was a great movie and I would urge many to see it. I learned a bit of Mexico's history.A. Rolison
5,A Neglected Piece of History,"Anyone who cares about religious freedom will relish this well-made, gripping film, based on a neglected piece of Mexican history. The casting and acting are superb. An absolute MUST see!"
4,Very Interesting,This is some history that I was never exposed to in school. It was interesting to find out that the U.S. was complicit with the Mexican government in crushing the freedom of religion for Mexican citizens so we could have easy access to Mexican oil resources.The movie was very well made and Andy Garcia was great in the role.
5,Fantastic true story,"Most people know little or nothing about the Cristeros War in Mexico in the 1920-30's. Wonderful, true story of real life heroes! Excellent!!"
5,For Greater Glory,"This film is a precursor for this country if we don't understand the basic precepts of freedom as guaranteed by our Constitution. Mexico's battle, by their religious and brave people, barely held on to theirs, as depicted by this film. It is a terrific accounting of a pathetic attempt to deny a people those God-given rights."
4,For Greater Glory BD/[Blue-Ray],Great movie for all christians that need to pass on knowledge of thier faith. The movie has a good cast and is one one to watch more than once. I would recommend this film to all families.
5,A First class movie.,"Watch ""For Greater Glory"" if you want to know more about the history of Mexico, about courageous dedication to faith and country. A great script and acting."
4,Very Revealing,"Well acted, and very revealing of what Mexico tried to do to the Catholic Church in the early 1900's. I had never heard of this story and is a a phenominal movie."
5,Awesome,"The movie was inspiring, and the scenery beautiful. The entire family watched it together and we all enjoyed it, Can not say enough about this movie..loved it"
4,Great historical film,"This was a great film! Unfortunately, didn't get much attention from the media but was historically accurate and inspiring. I would recommend it highly!"
4,Review of film For Greater Glory,I certainly enjoyed the informative film.It will certainly give me much to think about and ponder. I still do not understand why it was so difficult to locate and why the film only played for one day in our area.
4,Pretty Good,"The movie was inspiring, moving and worth my time! Recommend to anyone that loves history or Christianity. Would watxh it over again which is rare for me."
1,hi there,hi like too reture the Pharos PK041 Pocket GPS Navigator Axim X3SW US Maps Car Charger PDA Holder can you put my money back too my credite card ok
2,not worth the money - borrow it from the library,"I have this and am trying to learn celestial nav. If you borrow it from the library, it is worth watching, but for 39.95, save your money and look somewhere else. What you get here are old US Navy training films that are directed toward idiots - and there is not enough detail to actually learn celestial nav from this DVD.But if you can get it free, what it."
3,For the price a great little TV,"This TV has a incredible picture, my only complaint is that the sound is not that loud. I put it in my bedroom and while the AC is running it is very hard to hear, and the AC isn't real loud, it's brand new. I got around this problem as I have Satellite TV and I just ran the sound from the box to my stereo, the only fall back to this solution is that you have to keep swithching the connections between the Satellite box, the VCR and the DVD, depending which one is being watched at the time. So if you are planning to put this anywhere there may be additional noise I wouldn't recommend it unless you have another source to boost the sound."
4,Good for the Price,TV has great color and clarity. The remote is very cool that the buttons glow in the dark. I would definately purchase it again!
3,"Nice picture, but poor sound.","A good little TV for a small bedroom, but the sound is uneven and tinny."
2,I think I'm the wrong audience for this novel,"I bought this book at a library book sale because it was short and a paperback so easy to carry while traveling. I didn't know anything about it and so had no expectations. As I read the novel, I became increasingly annoyed and distracted by the triviality of it, which resulted in a ""who cares "" attitude toward the characters in the story. I didn't really finish the book -- finally giving up toward the end, though I slipped away to the end to see how it would turn out. The writing is competent, but unless you are interested in relentless descriptions of weddings and the struggles of a young single woman in NYC, I'd give this novel a pass. Unfortunately, I was in the mountains of Wyoming and had nothing else to read."
5,Brilliant contradictions,"Funny, the ""negative"" quality that bothered other readers is the very thing that drew me in to The Trouble With Catherine. Does that make me a sourpuss? I don't think so. What Hruby recognizes is that the most interesting characters in fiction and life are the ones whose flaws are apparent rather than hidden beneath layers of mannered insincerity. It takes a certain amount of bravery to walk out on that ledge, risking the scorn of people who prefer the pretty surfaces of things. I'm looking forward to Hruby's next effort."
3,The trouble with this novel...,"...is that the heroine is one-dimensional and irritating. Catherine thought that she was happy with her single life, but she begins to contemplate putting an end to her freedom when she loses her friends to marriage. Her boyfriend appears to be perfect -- handsome, successful, thoughtful -- which is why she cannot understand why his behavior has changed. Is her fiance Mr. Wrong, or is she really ready for marriage?The dialogue is sharp and the characters are fun, but I couldn't swallow Catherine. There's something about the protagonist that troubles me..."
4,What a conflict!,"When the husband and the sister in law hook up it leaves the family full of hate. The wife, the child, is full of hate. This story is about forgiveness and moving on...family forgiveness."
2,Not what I expected at all,"Having just read ""The Charm Stone"", I was ready to be impressed with this book. It was a disappointment in most ways. It takes about 200 dull pages to come the point, (which, by the way, the reader will figure out about page 60), and is generally slow. I never managed to identify with either the hero or heroine. In fact, the heroine is dropped out for a couple of chapters and you find that you don't even notice or care. The ending was superficial and unsatisfying.This book had the potential to give us an intriguing Otherworld, but simply fell short."
1,Only if you must and have nothing to do.....,"I must say that this was not what I thought it would be, the book I mean.I have read two books of Ms. Kauffman and it seems like this story is missing something.In Royal Hunter, I thought that when it comes to the main char. the story is going somehow very slow and rushing when it was about the others.When I was about 2/3 of the book, still nothing happened in the story.(saving the future queen and country)If I've known I'd chosen another book to read but I think it's ok when you really have nothing special to do."
2,Not THe Best,The 1932 serial Shadow of the Eagle stars John Wayne in one of the many films he made before he became a major star. It is not a western. John Wayne plays a(then) modern day pilot fighting the bad guys and winning the heart of a young lady. It is a boring film that I think even hard-core fans of John Wayne will not enjoy.
4,Grapefruit knife,"It's a good knife, generally, though I've used sharper sawtooth knives: it is a little difficult getting the last part of the fruit cut away from the rind. The inner sheath was not altogether satisfactory: I found even a washed and dried knife would stick to it."
5,Heavy-duty lounger made to last!,"We've recently bought several pool floats and toys to enjoy our first summer with a pool! This Day Dreamer Lounger is the best product we've bought so far. The air has held wayyyyy better than anything we've bought so far. The plastic that is used to make this product is also much thicker and abrasion-resistant than anything we've got. The material used to make this is clearly and visibly stronger than most pool floats.Since purchasing other items, in the future we will be looking for floats and toys with a heavy-duty plastic. We bought one 72"" float/raft and it feels like you could tear the raft in two with your hands its so thin. We've patched it twice already.Again, no one should worry over purchasing this Day Dreamer."
1,this is not a BOOK,"This bad document, this is not a book. I paid 3.99 for this one page, misguided by the term BOOK. Read further and you will find this is a silly little bio that can be googled for free. No need to pay for this info.What ever you want to call this, please do not call it a BOOK!!!! Amazon should be kind to their buyers and be more accurate describing their products."
5,great music,"Finally!!! It's been released in CD!! I have waited years for the world to rediscover Lalo Schifrin. I knew when Mission Impossible was made into a movie it was only a matter of time. Together with the Marquis de Sade album, New Fantasy expanded jazz for me in the 1960's and 70's. If you like straight ahead, jazz big band jazz with a unique twist you will enjoy New Fantasy."

5,"Another ""wow!"" book by an accomplished author","It takes a special author to combine the intricate, volatile maneuverings of the underworld with the redeeming love of Jesus Christ, and not come off sounding a bit corny. But Margaret has managed to pull this off skillfully with a novel you will simply not be able to put down. It is a masterpiece among even blockbuster novels!"
5,I couldn't put this exciting book down.,"I've just read Margaret Johnson's ""The Witness"" for the second time. The first time I couldn't put it down because I had to find out what happened...the second time I couldn't put it down because I was so engrossed in the content. Margaret makes her characters truly come to life with much suspense, intrigue and unexpected twists and turns. I lived through the Northridge earthquake so was kept on pins and needles as that devastating event unfolds on the pages of this exciting book."
4,Good cleaning cloth for film,"I use this cloth to clean old 8mm movie film along withEdwal Anti-Stat Film Cleaner, for Black & White and Color Films, 4 Oz. Bottlebefore running the film through the movie projector. This removes any lint as well as lubricates the film to eliminate scratches.The cloth is a little expensive but the old movie film is irreplaceable and I don't want to damage it."
2,cleaning cloth,I have some old slides and they are dusty and have spots. I read in reviews that this cloth was recommended. I was very disappointed when it scratched one of my slides though it didn't scratch all of them. I would have to say to be careful and try on one that is not important. Even then I would be hesitant. Back to the drawing board as far as my slides. I will just use this cloth to clean my computer screens.
5,"it's wounderful specially for sensetive skin, i love it soooo much","ALMAY IS MY BEST NIGHT CREAM, I USED IT SINCE LONG TIME AND I LOVE IT, I BUY ALWAYS WHEN YOU HAVE SPECIAL OFFER AND GIVE FOR FRIENDS, CAUSE MOST OF THEM ASKING WHAT KIND OF FACE CREAM DO YOU USED , WE LIKE YOUR FACE SKIN, AND YOU ARE NOT GIVING AT ALL YOUR AGE, PLEASE WHEN U HAVE SPECIAL OFFER AT ALMAY CREAM SEND ME AN EMAIL TO BE AWARE OF THAT, THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH FOR THE AMAZING CREAM.Jessyazzam@hotmail.com"
3,Okay but not great,The cd was okay but not great. I was expecting the music that I hear on cartoon network.
4,"nice, but lacking","Overall a good CD, but seriously lacking in the old-school. The best Toonami song ever was their Robotech theme, which is missing. The rest of the songs are nice, though. The CD really shows the changing priorities at Toonami- they're more anime focused and less interested in their old-school toons- Thundercats, Voltron, Robotech, etc. If you've watched Toonami for only a year or two, buy this immediately. If you've been with them since the beginning, however, you may feel a little forgotten."
4,Canadian Swing sure is King!,"Big Rude Jake sure is mean, angry and nasty kinda guy. Album starts with ""Gotham City Serenade"", ""Speak Easy"" is a wonderful song to listen when a bar you're in is closing & you're pretty drunk and you're thinking about your lost love. ""Andy's Requiem"" is a Tom Waits kinda song, ""Let's Kill All The Rock Stars"" is about radio playing same ol' songs over and over again... Very enjoyable record."
3,Not so chic........,"For a book with this title, I'm surprised that all of the decor shown is basically just typical country. I was looking for country with a more contemporary feel, but that is not how ""chic"" is defined for this book. Otherwise it's not a bad country decorating book per se, I just think it should have a different title."
2,"Good for the Novice, Not seasoned gingerbread bakers!","I should have read ALL of the reviews. My bad. Instead I was in a rush, and added it based on all the positive comments. If you are a novice, this book will work well for you. However, for the more seasoned builder/baker this was a waste of money. It's not worth it to send back. I'll probably give this as a gift to my nephew who wants to give this a try."
4,helpful,"This book was a great help for building our house, but I would have liked to see real picture examples. All examples were drawn."
2,Missing picture,"I wasn't very pleased with this book, very vague and not a lot of pictures.I have several others that are much better quality. I wouldn't buy it again"
5,The Best for Gingerbread Girls and Boys,"This book is clear, descriptive, and explains things simply, but thoroughly. The patterns and photos are especailly helpful, and the projects are charming.When I decided to make a gingerbread house, I looked at every book on the shelf. I needed all the help I could get! This is the best book out there."
5,"a wealth of great ideas in a small, simple book","I've seen bigger books on making gingerbread houses, I've seen fancier books, but this is the all-time best book yet on the subject. It's simple, clear and loaded with creative ideas. I found this book when I was about to make my first gingerbread house. Now, 20 houses later, it's still my favorite book on the subject."
2,Gwyneth and the Thief,"The plot was very well written and interesting, especially for people who enjoy reading romance or history novels. But, the plot was being built up far too much. The author got stuck in the middle, yet kept plowing on. The end was hasty compared to the rest of the book. Though I enjoyed the beginning, i thouroughly do not reccomend this book."
4,an enjoyable read...cheesy and romantic! :D,"Gwyneth and the Thief is a fun historical romance about a lady and a thief. gwyneth, 15, is left in charge of her father's castle when he gets sick. she enlists the aid of gavin, a thief, to pose as a squire and train the villagers to fight in case her neighbour [a baron] tries to take over her castle. obviously, she falls in love with gavin and him with her. they know that a love between a thief and a lady can never take place. what will happen next?!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~i really enjoyed this book. the plot is quite unbelievable and the lines are cheesy and very modern [not at all medieval], but the book is still very enjoyable. as long as you don't go in expecting too much, you will enjoy this!"
5,A must have for the serious collector!,This paperback is chock full of useful information about collecting and estimating the value of the pieces in your collection written in plain English.
4,Convincing,The author was skeptical of events which he witnessed. He brings the reader along on his journey of discovery. I have loaned it to other therapists and to people who are anxious about what occurs after death.
5,Induced after-death communication,I thoughally enjoyed this book and in fact loaned it to a friend! The information in relieved me and helped me to know there is an afterlfe
1,Teases Without Delivering,"Very misleading title since the author says on Page XVIII that the procedure requires EMDR ""that can be applied only by a licensed psychotherapist with EMDR training."" The book comsists of little more than the author's war stories.In fact the procedure will work, if it works at all, using tapping of accupressure points and eye movements described in Lambrou and Pratt's ""Instant Emotional Healing"" and numerous other books on using accupressure to resolve emotional problems.This is a book about one approach to the therapy of grief and only that."
2,review,Found nothing worth wild in this book. It is like going to the candy store but having to stay outside and look in. Title is misleading all talk no show. Must find a trained person at $200.00 + an Hour and no guarantee.
1,"BORING, BORING, BORING","THIS BOOK SUCKS WITH A CAPITAL S. I CAN'T BELIEVE I PAID THE $ FOR THIS F-ING BOOK. SAVE YOUR MONEY, PSYCHOLOGISTS AND OTHERS ALIKE AND GO HAVE A STARBUCKS INSTEAD. THIS AUTHOR OBVIOUSLY IS HIGH ON HIS OWN ANDROGENS AND THINKS HE KNOWS THINGS THAT HE OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T KNOW JACK SH.. ABOUT. I CANNOT BELIEVE ANYONE WOULD BELIEVE ALL HIS BS, SELF INDULGENCE AND PATTING HIMSELF ON THE BACK IS ALL THIS BOOK IS ABOUT."
2,Booooooooooring!,After the first few cases all of the rest are the same. So incredibly boring I couldn't even finish it.
5,Playful,"A playful novel and exceptionally well written. It has been a difficult transition for many of the 'political' writers of the 1970s to write in a contemporary, ""less immediate"" Latin America...Dorfman, with this novel, manages the transition well. The novel has been likened to those produced by Vargas Llosa and is worthy of this high praise. My only reservation is the exceptionally hermetic last two (or so) paragraphs...nevertheless, if the journey is more worthy than the final destination, the novel will not disappoint at all."
2,Tedious,"I should have put this book down when my gut told my so, but went ahead anyway and it took me forever to struggle through it. It made very little sense and is very contradictory and most confusing! I suppose it makes sense to some, but I really tried and came up with straws."
5,I've loved it all my life!,"My father was a co-author of this delightful little book. In the 1930's he and his friend, Al Brown, went on vacation to Washington, D.C. With time on their hands and fueled with a little beer, they found themselves in the U.S. Patent office looking up odd things that had actually gotten patents. It was first published as, ""Beware of Imitations"" and was reviewed favorably by Life Magazine. Patent Attorneys collected it. Then, it was published as, ""Absolutely Mad Inventions"". When my father was in his late 80's, he sold the rights to it for a paltry sum. This publication is news to me. I re-read it often and cherish the copy he signed to me (his oldest), ""To My First Edition"". Naturally, I heartily recommend it."
2,"Unforunately is great, but ...","This little gadget is amazing and the effects sound beautiful but it doesn't work at all with Windows 7, at all, after a couple of seconds you will not get any sound. By the time of this writting (march 2010) Line 6 hasn't been able to release a steady driver."
3,Entertaining (very good) but lack of closure on ending,"All the other reviews are pretty much on target with the fact that this is a pretty well-written mystery that keeps the reader interested. I was certainly caught up in it. However, in a somewhat Japanese fashion, the ending is left open, which left me with a sense of lack of closure and disappointment. I much prefer the closure and surprising ending offered by the Tattoo Murder Case."
3,A Noir-Like Mystery About Modern Japan,"This uncertain identity mystery, coupled with the struggles of our detective hero, shine a light on a hidden aspect of modern Japan - the debt that bedevils so many Japanese, who suffer in silence. The light shines on the lives of two women, whose paths crossed - or did they? - in a fatal way. Although the story was at times awkward and felt a bit rushed, I enjoyed the methodical unraveling of the mystery by the hero. Will we get to see more of him in other books by Miyuki Miyabe, once they're translated?"
4,Have fun figuring this one out!,"I'm not a mystery fan, but I was intrigued by the synopsis on the back. This is an excellent book. Not because you don't know what happens (that's easy to figure out), but because you have no idea how things were done. Too bad more of this author's books haven't been translated into English."
3,clunky,"Miyabe does a good job creating Honma, the lead character, and the plot is reasonably realistic. But other than the lead the characters don't come alive and/or aren't stable or credible. In particular, Miyabe has trouble creating a stable voice for Honma's boy, a 10 year old who sometimes sounds like a (youngish) 10-year-old but other times serves as a weary adult voice when Miyabe thinks she needs that. Similar instability with the lead villain, who is never credibly fashioned into a monster.As others here have said, the long lectures on consumer credit are boring and damage credibility. Honma was long time on the juvenile beat and he's supposed to be unaware of the phenomena? Miyabe needed to find a different way to inform her readers, perhaps in a foreword or with some other device."
2,Not worth my time,"I found this book dull. It really doesn't get going until the final third and unless you have an unnatural level of interest in Japanese consumer credit, it's really not worth the effort. As other reviewers have noted, the ending is anti-climactic."
4,Entertaining Western,"FURY AT FURNACE CREEK (1948) is a very entertaining black-and-white western with plenty of action.Directed by Bruce Humberstone, it stars Victor Mature as a gambler and wayward son of an Army general (Robert Warwick) who has been accused of criminal behavior that led to an Indian massacre at a military fort.After the general dies of a stroke during his court-martial, Mature, using an assumed name, travels to the nefarious town of Furnace Creek in an effort to prove his father's innocence and clear his name. He goes to work for the town boss (Albert Dekker), who he believes to be responsible for the massacre.Problems occur with Mature's estranged brother (Glenn Langan) shows up and the two men find they are working a cross purposes.Coleen Gray, Reginald Gardiner, Fred Clark and Jay Silverheels co-star in this minor gem.Michael B. Druxman"
3,"I bought this for my mom, but she said it was too easy","Hey everyone,I bought this game for my mom, but she said it was too easy.My mom has a very high iq, although she is not a genius. My mom is 62, but she is still a gamer. My mom is very cool.Make of this information as you wish...I just wanted to share in case anyone in a dilemma over purchasing or not purchasing this game fits my moms description, as I feel this could help. =)"
4,Makes you think and has good replay value,"Making you think and having good replay value are what this type of game is all about, and Mind Quiz wins on both. These are the types of games that you have to put some real thought into if you want to get better at them. I gave 4 stars out of 5 because there are a couple of games included that are not original and are presented much better elsewhere. For example sudoku is included, but there are much better sudoku games available."
4,great takahashi art,"i am somewhat of a student of japanese culture and i found this novel to be a fun way of gently showing the japanese in everyday life. not only that, but it was enjoyable to read. if you are interested in japan or just enjoy a good manga collection, this is a good one to pick up."
3,Dos tres chafa,El Alex Lora ya está chafeando en este disco pero sigue teniendo algunas rolas dos tres chidas
4,before you buy this,"before you spend $30-$40 on this piece of plastic go to your local store and buy a couple packs of 3m dual lock (velcro) i attached 4 strips (4 on time capsule 4 on wall) to my time capsule and its been holding up on the wall for a few weeks just fine, also i can pull with a little force and no budge, its rated for 8lbs and the time capsule is 3.5"
5,Great Product!,It does exactly what I wanted and said it would do and with style. Had it up and WiFi running in about 15 min. Great way to get your apple airport extreme mounted high from the down in the basement to improve connectivity.
3,Good but expensive,"It does the job, I needed to place the airport extreme on the roof and the only option available was to buy this mount. It goes unoticed after it is installed, and secures the router in place. Also comes with a mount for the power supply transfomer. BUT, it is too expensive to be a plastic mount. Instead, apple could add a couple of holes in the back of the router as Cisco does, with this, you just need a couple screws and done!!!"
5,"Perfect, highly recommended.",Exactly what I was looking for. I needed to have my AirPort Extreme mounted on the wall for better reception and this is what is needed.
4,Clean way to mount Airport Extreme where you want it,"I used the Airmount to mount an Airport Extreme on the underside of a built in work surface. The product was easy to mount to the surface and was easy to install the power supply and the Airport Extreme into their respective mounting pieces. One thing to keep in mind is that if you are planning on using the Airmount to mount your Airport Extreme in a highly visible location, you will still have to find a clean way to deal with the power and LAN cables. Along with this cable routing challenge, it is important to take into account that Airport Extreme slides in to the Airmount along the front-back axis. So you need to have enough cable length to accommodate this dimmension of the Airport Extreme."
4,Silliness and Mayhem,"My third-grade son recently got into the Groo graphic novels and has read several of them. This book is very funny. There's an undertone of serious commentary on the human condition (my son was oblivious to this, of course). Too violent for really young children or the squeamish. If you've got an older kid or a teenager around your house who doesn't much like to read, you might try them on this."
4,Beatyful pictures,"I can take pictures more beuty and exiting, something I see a shadow from the lens."
5,"Over the top, totally.","Someone said elsewhere this movie was over the top (in a negative way) but they were right - it is ""over the top"". Released shortly after the Jeeves and Wooster series (Fry and Laurie, BBC) and riding that wave of Wodehouse popularity, it is star-studded and lushly produced. It is as ludicrous, preposterous and befuddled-funny as Wodehouse can be, and far better production quality than the old Wodehouse playhouse TV series. Classic and wonderful."
4,Decide For Yourself!,This CD wasn't exactly what I had hoped for overall but a few of the songs made the purchase worth it! I think it's just a matter of personal taste more then lack of quality so listen to the samples for yourself and make your own decision!
4,Fifa soccer 2005,I bought this game for my son's 7th birthday. He has been playing it non stop since then (2 weeks) and has learned so much about soccer. He is also on a soccer team and has shown improvement since learning more. He is more confident in the game. He loves it! Great game. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that I know the updated versions (2006-07) are better. At least that is what my son thinks since his friend has that. They like to switch off.
5,BEST SOCCER GAME TO DATE!!,"This by far the best soccer game i have ever witnessed. I from Europe and iit has all the teams i follow so I play with my favorite teams ( go Kaiserslauten). It features a great franchise mode that is nicly polished, and the tourny mode is graet for parties. This games proves that EA games is , will and continue to be a powerhouse in videogame industry. Anyone even a little bit intrested in the soccer world should definitly check this one out( make sure ou ahve ebough blocks on your memory card- and if you do not have it yet, get the 1019 block memory it's ideal for sports games that use up so many blocks. Overall=8.5/10This wouldn't receive sportgame of the year(it would lose to mvp baseball 2004) but it's a fun ride that doesn't end. Also this game is not the game you will really play all the time ( considering the game of soccer is a bit tedious) but it's fun when you play it."
5,All The Way With JBP,"If only as a point of reference about post-Hendrix guitar, you should get ""Trippin'"". ""Love Crime"" ""Garden of Love"" ""Stranger"" and the title cut sear with great writing, inspired singing and killer, I repeat KILLER GUITAR work. I went to see Jean-Paul everywhere he played in NYC in 91 & 92 just for ""LoveCrime"" alone. If you love Vernon, swear by BB, Albert & Freddy and realise that this is another of the great Miles Davis sidemen. Get a copy of this CD."
4,Comparisons to Hendrix Are Inevitable,"In my never-ending-search for Telecaster Perfection ala Jimi, I have stumbled upon J.P. Bourelly, who I highly recomend. With a classic style, soulful licks, hammer-ons and pull-offs reminiscent of the Almighty Hendrix himself, this guy rocks. Try it, you won't be disappointed."
5,5 star fabulous,"the playboy fabulous forties dvd is super especially claudia gallion. the dvd is worth it for here alone but the others are just as fine, out of all of the playboy dvds i own this by far is my pride and joy of playboy dvds."
5,spiked out k9,"Not only is my k9 a good looking Malinois, he looks even better with his harley davidson collar off duty..thank you Amazon"
2,Forkchops,Cheap plastic stamped forkchops. Novelty item only...not for gift unlessa novelty. Not suggesting multiple orders.
5,Star Wars,I've been a big fan since I was a kid. So it was great to finally have a full movie set. A must have for Star Wars fans.
2,Somewhat uninspired,"The favorable reviews of this CD were just too kind. Greg Giuffria is of course a first-class keyboard player. But his instrumental skills don't compensate for the more serious drawbacks on this CD. The songwriting is rather uninspired, with few interesting melodic ideas. Further, the gravel-laden vocals don't fit well with this musical style. Greg Giuffria has played with several other bands, so listeners who enjoy his keyboard work would be better advised to buy the either first two Angel albums, or the first few albums by House of Lords. These were both more melodic and more progressive."
5,"Great towel. Expensive, but worth it.","I love Aquis towels. They are soft, super-absorbant, fast drying and lightweight. The waffle aquis is even more absorbant and quick-wicking than the regular variety, apparently because of the increased surface area. They take up less room in the linen closet and suitcase too. Highly recommended."
2,Not worth the money,"Think carefully about why you want this towel before you buy it. If you need a towel that dries quickly (like for the beach), then this would be great for you. If you don't need the towel dry until the next time you take a shower, then probably a less expensive towel would do just as well. What I don't like about the towel is that it rubs/drags across wet skin instead of glides the way a cotten towel does. It does NOT feel soft and luxurious. It dries quickly and takes up very little space, but it does not feel good."
3,"Effective, but odd texture","Very absorbent, dries quickly, and very light. The sticky, ultra-absorbent texture is annoying to work with, feeling a bit flimsy and even cold. Instead of a quick rub-down, I nearly have to pat myself dry - otherwise, it would probably dry me off quicker than a regular towel.If I were carrying my own towel somewhere, I'd probably choose this because of its effectiveness. For daily use, I'd choose a nice towel, or even a regular towel, over this one."
5,"Keeps you dry, keep dry","This is the second Aquis Microfiber Body towel I have purchased. The waffle weave makes a huge difference. I had a plain microfiber towel and it just didn't feel like a towel. The Aquis towel has a real towel feel, dries me off great and then dries out quickly. I keep it in my gym locker and it's dry the next time I need it. In the summer, I use it after swimming in the morning and it's dry by the time I teach swimming in the afternoon. And it doesn't take up much room in my locker or gym bag. It would be great where I used to spend my summers in Michigan where it was tough to dry out the beach towels."
3,Aquis Microfiber Towel Too Thick,"I returned this product because I had not expected a microfiber towel to be so thick and bulky. I needed a towel which was very light and compact, so I ended up with one from REI, which while not as pretty will fit my needs far better."
3,Does what it says but...,Although this towel does do a very good job of drying you off.......there is something about the touch that does not appeal to me....that of course is a personal preference of mine. The towel does do the job and does launder very nicely.
2,Almost,"Well, the reviews made it seem dreamy, but it's not quite there for me. The fabric is thin, so it makes it a bit strange to dry yourself off.Also, it's a cream color, and not white at all - I'm disappointed in that, for sure.I think I'll go back to plushy cotton towels - this was a disappointment."
4,pluses and minuses,"What I love: Using this towel to dry my long hair -- when I wrap it around my hair like a turban, it's amazingly light and it stays put, unlike a regular towel. For this reason alone, I use it every day and will probably get at least one more.Pleasant surprise: I thought it might catch on my dry skin the way microfiber sometimes does, but I haven't had a problem with that.What's just OK: It seems to be no more (or less) absorbent than my thick cotton towels, and hanging in the bathroom, it takes just as long to dry.What I don't like: I don't think it looks as nice hanging on the towel rack as my colorful cotton towels do. It would, however, look awesome in a sleeker, eco-modern style bathroom."
3,Good if all you care about is absorption,"It's a thin, light towel that absorbs very well. It dries you quickly and never feels wet. And that's where the pros end.It has a lot of rubbery friction: it doesn't slide against your skin. You pretty much have to dab it on yourself. You have to wash it very often otherwise it will start smelling awful. And stains don't come out easily.If all you care about is absorption, then this is the towel for you. Don't offer it to your guests though."
5,Awesome,"This towel is light and absorbent. I can wrap it around my hair and not have a head or neck ache afterwards. My thick, curly hair has looked better than it has in a while, thanks to this towel's quick drying power. However, don't expect it to dry long, thick hair too quickly - based on the reviews, I figured my hair would be dry after a few minutes, but that was not the case. Still, it dried faster and nicer than with a regular towel. I will definitely buy more of these."
3,Not as nice as the small ones,"This larger sized towel is a good size, but the overall texture does not seem to be as absorbent as the smaller, smooth surface one I have for my hair."
3,"good advice, but very basic","The advice in this book is good--learn to relax, identify mental distortions, eat right, exercise, simplify your life. If you haven't been in therapy, or the idea of acknowledging your anxiety and doing something about it is new to you, I think this would be a great book. As someone who's dealt with severe anxiety for a prolonged period of time and explored various treatments, however, this book is not particularly helpful (I've been told to do yoga so many times it's almost a cliche, and yes, I've done yoga). So really, I think whether this book will be helpful is a matter of the severity of your problem and your previous experience with treatment."
3,Not a bad book.,On the plus side this book does give 10 things you can do to combat anxoety. On the negative side they are common knowledge type advice with meditation and what not. Objectively the techniques were very well explained and detailed. Subjectively the author says he isn't dogmatic yet he calls positive self talk 'new age crap'. Self talk is the number one way I keep anxiety from becoming a full blown panic attack so I really don't know if the author truely dismisses a powerfull coping tool or he is just simply refering to something like the Stewart Smally character on SNL and did a poor job defining what exactly he was refering.By Smally I meant the wuss who stares at himself in the full length mirror and tells himself how special he truely is.
4,Helpful tool,This book was recommended by a counselor and I found it to be very helpful. It has some very practical tips for dealing with anxiety.
4,Concise and Well Done,"As another reviewer commented, this is in a simpler form than the Anxiety and Phobia Workbook. This will likely be a plus for many who don't like to read. Overall, solid and well written.Mike Miller, PhD[...]"
4,X-mas present,"The price was reasonable. I have seen this kind of t-shirts before but it is difficult to find ""volleyball"" items. I really would have liked the size small but couldn't find one. This is a gift so hopefully the medium will be ok. Overall very happy with the purchase. Thanks"
5,beautiful,"unlike traditional black metal, this album is centered around melody, guitars and voice. the melody is a mix of guitar and keys while the voice of Krell is snake-like and sinister. and let us not leave out the beautiful female voice that is poeticly incorporated into these songs of masterpiece. the songs themselves are not overly fast with blistering double bass, but are melodic, talented, and very impressive in their own right."
3,Mclaughlin,I only liked the first song. The other songs (the tunes) did not interest me and were not catchy to me but his guitar playing were still very good considering he had some injury to his hand.
1,What wrong with u little children!!!,They made those songs sound like crap. Only Losers would listen to that crzy junk like that. or maybe little kids but please u don't even now the meaning of those songs! They can't even sing those songs good. Just leave it to the professionals Kidz Bop
1,Hahaha pathetic,Rofl...i don't own this cd but when I saw the commercial for it HAHAHA I started laughing so much that I cried...Terrible voices man..I can't stand it!Just wait for them to hit puberty first!!I dont think that this is a KIDZ cd..(...).With the songs like toxic and are u gonna be my girl..Why can't they get teenagers who just sing songs like Breaking the habbit(linkinpark)Time and time again(Chronic future)Vermilion(slipknot:D)Your rival....roland MUUHUUHAHA
2,"Read, and Choose","KIDZ BOP********Sung by: Random people, along with a group of kids.Songs: All the songs kids like.Trash Level: No trash.NOW***Sung By: Whoever sings the song.Songs: Most of the songs kids like, but there are a few ones that most kids have never heard.Trash Level: There is cussing, and innappropriate subjects in some of the songs.RADIO DISNEY************Sung By: Whoever sings the song.Songs: The songs kids like.Trash Level: No trash.You decide which is better."
1,What a Horrible Idea!,"I always hated Kidz Bop (drool) and the commercials are beyind embarrasing. Cover art is cheap looking and has a modern 90's look, which is bad. And the singing-where can I begin? These kids can't sing! Nope, young ones, not one bit. These kids are like rejects from American Idol. Ya know, it's too bad how there is not a lot of music for in between kids. Top 40 crap is too mature, while Kidz Bop and Wiggles are too young for them. Well, if your kid likes Radio Disney, that would be a better choice."
1,0 STARS FROM PPL WHO LOVE MUSIC!,"I am completely disgusted that people would pay money to children to destroy beautiful music. Kids Bop is nothing but a scam to get parents to beloeve that their children are listening to beautiful songs sung by kids. The truth is that most of these kids bop songs are modern songs appreciated by teenagers. Not to mention that these songs CAN NOT be sung by children.So don't waste your money paying for a cd of a bunch of children ruining some of the best music. If you want to listen to the songs, buy the originals. They are hits because they are amazing anad beautiful songs SUNG by the people who are meant to sing them, not a bunch of off pitch, whiny, 10 YEAR OLDS.And for you kids bop. Stop destroying the music. It's people like you that take the money of unsupecting parents and trash beautiful music that make music lovers like me SICK. In other words, BACK THE HELL OFF OF OUR MUSIC!!!"
1,...,"Why do they call this cd ""kid's bop""? The kids don't even want to listen to it! It's that bad of a cd.I feel embarrased myself... being a kid an all I don't want people to think that I'd actually listen to this stuff! And have you seen the commercials?If you want to waste your money, this is the perfect uppourtunity."
1,THere is a Kidz bop 7! :(!!!,"People there is now a kidz bop 7. It has songs on it like Leave (Get out), 1985, Breakaway, and more. Most of my favorite songs are on it. So why does this cd get 1- no zero stars? Because squeaky little seven year olds sing the songs! This cd is rated #1997 on amazon.com! That shows how much people hate it! I bet the original singers of these songs feel insulted to hear horrid 7 year olds sing them! [...]"
1,I need a new happy place,"I swear I will hunt down those kids and tell them exactly what I think about their CDs. I saw the commercial for the 7th one and I heard the part about kid-friendly songs then they showed Happy Ending by Avril. Now, if they used the CD version, that's not kid friendly. Actually, neither is the edited version. THESE AREN""T KID-FRIENDLY SONGS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!They're made for teenagers or at least 11 year olds AT LEAST!!!!!!!!!! Geez, if i want a mix of my favorite songs, i'll just go to best buys and get a NOW cd. I would advise everyone else to do the same."
1,A Big Joke,"Listening to Kidz Bop is more painful than getting a swift blow to the head with dad's PVC pipe extension, and believe me I would know. Where are those anti-depressants that cause kids to commit suicide, because I could use the strongest one you've got when mom puts this crap on in the minivan. Playing this CD around children should be the equivalent to verbal abuse, and it virtually is. Please protect the sanctity of music and not buy this compilation of bastardized hits which blew enough to begin with."
5,My 8-year-old Loves It!,"There are many songs on the radio today that I don't allow my eight-year-old daughter to listen to, basically because of the language and some of the songs content. But with the Kidz Bop CDs she can keep up with today's popular songs and I don't have to worry about the language or content. I am not sure why so many people wrote such horrible reviews of the CD but they clearly don't get the point of the album and the fact that it is made for kids who are too young to hear the actual songs but still want to keep up with todays hits."
1,oh man,"this cd sucks so bad. if they wanted to make a cd for kids, they should have just edited the ""explict content"" out of the songs. half of these songs arent bad its just they were never meant to have this done to them. hold on is actually really great, but hearing the sample of the kids version defeats the whole purpose of the song."
1,Not Again.....,"They make me wanna pull my hair out. I saw this friggin' ad on tv, and the little girl said this: ''Kidz Bop scores everytime!'' Heh! Yeah, sure it does. then why come you got people like me sayin' it sucks and that it should be outta business? Huh? They copied great, excellent songs and turned them into rubbish. If they come up with Kidz Bop 7, I'll bite my tongue SO HARD, blood will ooze out! Lemme guess, they'll put Dip It Low, Freak-a-Leak, and My Band on the next one?!! Well, we'll see if I'm right. We'll see alright! :P"
1,RUN FOR YOUR SWEET LIVES!!! MUSIC'S FOUNDATION IS BURNING!!!,"Kidz Bop stinks. I will now explain the many steps the Razor & Tie executives took to achieve complete and total suckification:1. Get a bunch of 8 1/2 year-olds and give them 3,000 shots of helium, and then kick them in ""that place"". This is how the voice pitch is achieved.2. Then, get about 9 or 10 ""American Idol"" rejects and pay them a million dollars so they'll agree to do this project.3. Come up with 12-15 popular songs and ways to butcher their artistic integrity.4. Find some 11-year-old with PhotoShop to make the cover art. Remember, the bigger ""KIDZ BOP"" is, the better!5. Market your CD with never-ending commercials, chock-full of kids that didn't even sing the songs and probably will never be seen in the acting world again, ""But THAT'S NOT ALL!""s, and demands for COD/debit card payments.And voila! You have the typical Kidz Bop CD!"
1,Burn in Hell Kidz Bop,I cant believe that someone thought up this crappy CD. Whoever created this CD is stoned. Die Kidz Bop. I could scrape better songs out of my ass. Satan loves you. Only pedophiles like MJ would listen to this. I am gonna kill myself because this world has officially come to an end all because of kids bop.
1,One star is too good,"why are we degrading music even more. I don't care about the rehashed pop songs like ashlee simpson. those are crap anyways. but does anyone know how they get the rights to these songs? i heard that modest mouse cover was going to be on 7. so sad. but really, parents need to stop buing this crap"
1,Why?,"SOng that were ment for mature listeners, shouldn't be watered down (poorly) for children. Just buy your kids Music that was bland and unoffensive in the firstplace Like Hilary Duff, Avril Lavigne, or even B2K. DO you really think a kid isn't going to realise what the original words were before the substitutions? Or at least wonder what they were?But most importantly the singing is gawd awful. Period."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"If you value you your LIFE (or at least your poor EARS) do not get this awful c.d. It is really the WORST thing I have heard in my entire existence. These kids couldn't carry a tune in a bucket if it jumped in the bucket for them. Plus, they don't even use the same words. Yep. THEY CHANGE THE WORDS. So, I'm just saying, if I had a chance to either listen to this c.d. or jump off a cliff, I think I would have to jump off the cliff. Thank You."
1,What is the Freaking Point?,"WOW! This is horrible. I mean what is the point. it's not even any different lyrics than the origional songs. So PLEASE. Just let the artists sing their own songs. Not that most of the artist on this c.d. can do much better singing their own songs, but I don't knoow of many people on this planet that can sing worse than anyone on this c.d. It just doesn't make sense. And have you heard the dance remakes. i mean that's just what this world needs. A bunch of 9 years olds out boogying to this. We'll have to make some under 12 clubs for this one...But anyway. Just don't buy the c.d. period. You're doing yourself and those around you a huge favor."
1,Even Michael Jackson wouldn't buy this,"Dear merciful Gawd, my face hurts! I couldn't stop laughing! I'm still laughing as I type this!! Holy crap!! They should be blasting this music at the border to keep illegal immigrants out! Oh, no! Cola just came out my nose! And I'm now sterile!! No kids for me!!I tried flushing this crap down my toilet but it got clogged!!! Clogged I tells ya! Then I put it in the trash and the garbage man wouldn't take it!!!"
1,What?,"Why do they sing these songs? They ruin great hit songs! Like, Ocean Avenue by Yellowcard!But also, they sing songs that aren't really good for younger kids. Like, Toxic by Britney Spears! I saw the commercial and that song is really not good for them to sing. It has a really bad message to it."
1,This sucks,"All it is, is kids singing to songs that suck! As if the songs weren't already bad enough! Thgere's really nothing else for me to say but recommending the following bands:Strapping Young LadSuffocationSlayerMetallica(Even the new stuff is better than this crap!)DeathDeath Angel(no, they're 2 different bands)I'm done here."
1,Not for an Elementary school classroom,"I will admit that I haven't actually bought a KidzBop CD. I have been looking at the music selections, and on songs that I actually know (as a college senior) listening to the clips to see if I could ever use the song in my elementary school classroom. Of the ones I know that have curses in the adult versions, I do want to hear how they deal with those sections without paying for the song and not being able to use it. Which, most of the time, hasn't happened. I think I'll stick with Disney and Barney."
1,I rest my case.,"OMG!!!! This is the last time I will EVER review a Kidz Bop CD on Amazon.com. I mean seriously! Take kids with crappy voices and cross them together with songs that are INAPROPRIATE (i.e. Hold On, My Immortal) and what do you get? JUST PLAIN CRAP!"
1,Whoever like this cd makes me sick......,Because this cd is a waste of your money and you need to spend it on something more valueable than this.
1,Kids bop eats babies!,"if you buy this cd for your children..I promise you they will grow up to be serial killers and addicted to smack all because you wanted them to listen to good wholesome music...for gods sakes just let the listen to slayer's Dead Skin Mask a few times a day, and theyll grow up just fine...trust me."
1,Good for Kidz -- NOT!,"Many of the songs on this CD sucked to begin with, but some of them were actually pretty good.I bet when the original singers see/hear what these retarded children have done with their once-upon-a-time ""music"" they scream and want a lawsuit.What I want to know is: who the hell came up with the idea to take these so-called kid-appropriate songs and then sentence them to death by idiotic four-year-olds who don't even understand the words?If you're going to let your little kid listen to a teen's music choices, with only the inappropriate words edited (not the suggestive content) then you might as well let them listen to the real thing...Kidz Bop is beyond horrible... Reading these reviews has made me laugh awfully hard, but it's so sickly true that it's (almost) not funny.And to everyone who bought this for their kid (or kids who bought it for themselves): Go have your heads examined... Or possibly just allow yourself to be run over by a dumptruck to spare you this HEINOUS CD."
1,Too much commercialization,"I bought these for my 18-month old son, just as he was starting to speak, in an effort to teach him words. My kid loves these cards to toss around and throw. They are very poor if you want to teach with them. The items on the cards are from the videos. So for instance, a bear is a plastic bear with a violin from one of the videos. Some of the items are difficult to identify for this reason. Also they have things like rooster and chicken (which are difficult to differentiate) and a clock that looks like a toy. I let my son throw these cards around and bought two sets of DK My First Flash cards (Animals and Numbers and Counting), where a horse looks like a horse and not some stupid toy from a video(a.nd they are cheaper!)"
2,Disappointed,"I just purchased these for my 7 month old and was disappointed to find most of the pictures are photos of stuffed animals (lamb, pig, owl etc.) and not photos of the real thing. The picture of a bear is playing a violin and the star is unidentifiable. However, I do like that there are several languages printed on the back and the cards are big, bright and durable. These cards would have been excellent if only a pig was a photo of a real pig and not a pink ball of fluff!"
4,Learning Cards,"My daughter who is 1 likes these. I like them because they are helping her learn object names and what the words look like. She likes them for the nice illustrations. They are a good size for her to hold after we have gone over each one and she likes to collect certain animals in piles. There are a few blank cards in the pile so I taped pictures of family members onto them and labeled the cards with the person's name so she could see their picture, see their name and hear me say it at the same time to help her learn who everyone is. The cards are sturdy and great for taking along in her diaper bag. I agree with other reviewers that although I understand that many of the cards have pictures on them from the Baby Einstein videos and are connected that way, things like the ""star"" need a picture of a real star not a toy because it is not easily identifiable. All in all, best language development cards I have found for young children."
2,why not use photos of real animals?,I'm so disappointed in these cards - I plan to tape my own photos or cut outs from magazines to fix them. I'm baffled as to why Baby Einstein couldn't do a better job with photos resemblimg the word. Save money by making your own.
2,Real-life images of stuffed animals,"First, let me say that my child is a big fan of the Baby Einstein dvds. They do have educational value and are generally well done. The description of the flash cards includes the following ""Each beautifully illustrated card features real-life images..."". What about 50% of the cards featured were ""real-life images"" of stuffed animals. I expected a photo of a cow, pig, rooster, etc. There were photos or photo-realistic images of the fruits, but not of the animals. It was like a catalog for the toys used in the videos. I was very disappointed."
2,Not as good as other cards in the series,"These cards display stuffed animals instead of real animals. They are usually the same animals featured in the different videos. Some of the animals aren't recognizable to a young child, so they aren't very useful. There are some useful cards, like the pictures of some fruits and vegetables. However, these cards are overall very disappointing. Instead of real instruments, they feature play horns that, again, are likely featured in the videos. The Animal Discovery and Nature Discovery Cards are much much better."
2,Disappointed,"I was sorely disappointed with this CD. Having heard Roy Wood Jr.'s prank calls previously, I thought this was an unedited version. Unfortunately, it isn't and is not as entertaining as listening to the actual call."
2,disappointed,"After seeing Roy on the Craig Fergusen show, I was very interested in having some recordings of him and am anxiously awaiting his new CD promised to be out two months ago. I am going to try to see him in August when he comes to Columbus, and buy his hew CD when it comes out, but I feel this CD was not representative of his true genius in delivering his material."
4,Leontyne Price's voice is the closest thing to God singing,"This complilation is actually material from three complete albums, first Swing Low Sweet Chariot-14 Spirituals, then I Wish I Knew How It Would Fell to be Free and finally My Favorite Hymns. Added material from a Boston Pops Christmas album and her God Bless America digital CD.give you a lot of music for the money. Sprirituals and hymns are part of what Leontyne Price is all about and anyone interested in her life and music can't help but want to hear these recording. I recommended it."
4,Great Gospel Stuff,"This is a great CD. The only problem I have with it is that on some of the selections there is a boy's choir screaming in the background, and this takes away (a bit) from her performance. That said, her best selections are those that are either unaccompanied or those where her voice is not buried. Songs that strike me are - His Name So Sweet, He's Got The Whole World, Were You There, I Wonder as I Wander, Lift Every Voice and Sing, and my all time favourite Summertime. Enough said."
4,Predictable but well done,"This was the first of Jonathon King's novels I have read and I will likely go back for more. ""Eye of Vengeance"" is not particularly unique and any semi-intelligent reader will know pretty early where it is going. In such cases, the make or break factor is how well the book is written. If you can figure out the ending, the key is in the telling. Is the book bad enough that the reader puts it down or good enough that, despite the predictability of the plot, it is worth staying with? In this case, it's clearly the latter. King clearly knows his way around a newsroom; considering his background, he should. But he doesn't just know it, he makes it come alive and gives a good feel for the pulse and pace of putting out a paper (alliteration not intended). He puts a nice spin on stock situations (the pressuring editor, the stoic detective, etc) and weaves a tale that holds attention. I really liked the book and found it a compelling read."
3,Not as good as the Max Freeman Books,"I have recently discovered Jonathon Kings first Novel, The Blue Edge of Midnight which was excellent. I tend to get ""hooked"" on a character and enjoy following this character through several books. That may have been why I didn't enjoy Eye of Vengeance as much. I may have been reading a few too many mysteries as I guessed what was going on about halfway through. It was a quick read but not too hard to put down like the Max Freeman books are. Not a great book but good enough."
2,Too expensive,This is a good product but too expensive for what u get. The quality is just OK. You shouldn't pay more than 5 bucks for this
5,Just buy it!,"Don't think twice, just buy this. I use my video light And my rode videomic together using this product. Remember this isnt powered... All it does is that it gives you a great looking entrapment to mount two hot shoe using devices or equipment. Great product."
5,Great Product,Allows you to turn one shoe into two cold shoes. Very convenient when doing video using a wireless lav mic (presenter) and a shotgun mic (audience) at the same time.
1,Elegance was SOOOOOOOOOO much better!,"This little volume was obviously written on the heels of the much better ""Elegance"", a book I found both helpful and fascinating. This one seems much more haphazard in its subject matter and, as another reviewer has so accurately stated, treats adultery as if it's something merely annoying or even amusing that every woman must simply ignore. There was nothing I liked about it, and I actually threw the book away.One other comment: the paper this was printed on was flimsy and looked like newsprint. I expect hardcover books to be printed on decent paper since I'm paying so much for them.On the whole, quite disappointing."
1,Liar!,"There are a lot of people who really have been hurt by ""friendly fire"" and abused in churches. Mr. Warnke is not one of them! He's a liar and a fraud, and he brought it all on himself. That he would try to this up by pretending to be ""mistreated"" by Christians is just embarrassing. Grow up already, Mike! You defrauded your fellow Christians out of millions of dollars by pretending to be fighting an underground Satanist network. We're the ones who believed in you and sent you money. We're the wounded that you abused in your fraud schemes. Don't look to us for sympathy!"
1,con men never quit,"Mr. Warnke was exposed as a hypocrite, and a wolf feeding on the flock, using Christian's gullibility for personal gain. I just thank God that he had to go to Destiny Image, a vanity self-publisher, to get his excuses in print. Now if only D.I. would be a bit more discerning in who they choose to profit from."
1,It's GREAT being the Christian!,"So, Mike Warnke, lying like a cheap rug, defrauding people of money and causing family's lives to be disrupted, was all okay; just so long as he uses his perfidy to lead people to Christ???This book makes me say, once again: ""Thank the GODS, I'm a Pagan!"" Since so much of Christianity is ALREADY stolen myth and outright lies, a crap-merchant like Warnke, who can get his foot in the door, can spin spider webs-for-cotton-candy for YEARS and get away with it. This book is a case in point. It's essentially a case-study of, not IF Christianity is childishly maleable, but just HOW maleable they are."
3,"Boy, all you Christians just inspire me (said sarcastically)","You know, Mr. Warnke may have sinned, but so have we all. An no one sin is greater than the other. It just burns me up to see all you hypocrites ""throwing stones"" at a man who has made a few mistakes. Whatever happened to ""Judge not lest ye be judged"" or ""let he who is without sin cast the first stone"" or ""Before you remove the splinter in your brother's eye, take the plank out of your own."" All you people pronouncing judgement like you're God or something. Jesus preached forgiveness; he was perfect, yet he never pronounced judgement on the hooker with whom he spent his days."
2,Forgiveness,"I know that Mr. Warnke has been married 4 times, did not do some of the things he said and he will have to answer to what he has done. But look at the many people that he reached out to and that have since given their life to GOD. I am one of those. I am working toward my minister license and have and will serve GOD with my all. Mike helped me see where I was and where I could be. Who are we to criticize such a man? GOD is using him and through our love he will grow. I am not saying he is a saint but we as cristian's need to support, not finical, but spiritual."
3,Stop Whinning,"Yes, Mike Warnke was living off the ""Christian"" imagination. Truth is most Christians have no idea what satanism is. Satanism is everywhere in America and probably in your home and local church, you just don't know what to look for. I don't think Mike knows either, but Mike knows the typical christian mentality so he made up a ""Boogyman"" for you to get your worst nightmares vented out without feeling stupid. Now the truth is out and were all mad because his story wasn't true. Kudos to Mike for encouraging people to come to Christ.Take this book for the message it brings and pray for Mike Warnke. Look for my book coming soon exposing real satanism...""There Everywhere."""
3,Don't Be Fooled,"People expecting to get the item that is displayed will only get an XBox version of the guide(found that out the hard way). The screen image is of a version that may never be published. The real guide is good and follows the PC version quite closely but there are differences(there is no secret compartment on the Ebon Hawk and Kreia, not Atris, is Darth Traya). Be careful when purchasing this item for the forseeable future."
2,Useful to children,"While this strategy guide can come in handy when you can't do the math for the computer puzzles, it fails to give an accurate description of where and what do to and see. The character guides and information is weak and often useless. If you played through the game once, the guide offers no additional use in changing your gameplay."
5,Truly romantic and heartwarming,"I agree with the others that Jill Barnett has an exceptional ability to make her readers FEEL, laugh, and cry with the hero and heroine. The undercurrent sentimentalism and idealism make the very emotional story even more beautiful. Another remarkable thing about this book is that the supportive characters (Alec and Joy, for example) get enough pages that anyone who didn't know them before will rush and read their story the moment they finish ""Dreaming,"" though it is definitely one of the books you never want to see the end of."
4,Almost exceptional book...,"I'm not a big fan of romances in general, but Barnett's 'Dreaming' is worth reading. It contains lovable characters, an interesting plot, and some funny moments. I particularly love the hero and heroine's interactions with each other. Certain scenes would take me from tears to laughter in a matter of paragraphs.Maybe I'm just a relentless romantic and was glad that Letitia's persistance finally paid off or maybe it was the way Richard slowly fell in love with Letitia, but something made this book one of my all-time favorites.However, I couldn't give this book five stars simply because it assumes that the reader has finished some other Barnett work. I didn't care about the characters of Joy and Alec and wondered why they were even in it. Maybe if I had read the previous book, I'd care about them, but I didn't and felt precious page space was being wasted on them. That and the somewhat strange use of magic kept me from giving 'Dreaming' five stars."
4,Dreaming,"Letty Hornsby has loved Richard Lennox for eight years; she sees him as her knight in shining armor, her hero. Richard knows Letty loves him but he does his best to avoid her and her dog Gus (who really dislikes Richard). Letty is non-conventional and has managed to heap injuries upon Richard whenever she is around him. Letty, Richard and Gus beome prisoners of some inept smugglers but after damage to themselves and their ship, the smugglers begin to fear Letty's presence aboard. Not to mention Richard who is trapped on the ship with Letty and Gus. Richard goes from wanting physical distance from Letty to feeling protective of her to desire for her.The book has some hilarious sections; you feel sorry for misunderstood Letty and can almost feel Richard's frustration when he is around Letty, but you have to love the guy when he shows her compassion and makes attempts to understand her."
3,ok,This book was ok. I have read other books of Jill Barnett and have enjoyed the humor. This book was a little confusing at times. Maybe it was just me. I was confuse between the charactors on who was who and what was what.
3,"Cute, but not as good as Bewitching","Okay, so I'll admit I am a little late to the game with reading Jill Barnett. I absolutely fell in love with the first book in this series Bewitching. I was on the fence about even buying Dreaming because it sounded like it was missing the magic of the first book and I was right.This book centers on the Richard Lennox, The Earl of Downe, and Letitia Hornsby who have known each other since childhood. I won't spoil the story for anyone else who is late to reading this like I am, but basically Letitia is more than thrilled at seeing Richard again and a great adventure in sues. If you are looking for a light, fun read I recommend Dreaming. It can be read as a stand alone, but I recommend reading Bewitching first.BewitchingFirst in series"
2,This book although funny at times is also too shalow for me.,"There are two types of Ms. Barnet's novels, one is where the heroine is so childish and dimwitted that I feel like shaking her from time to time (e.g. Bewitching, Dreaming, Wild); the other one is where the heroine has a good common sense, can be serious but still funny and loving (e.g. Wonderful, Imagine, Carried Away) these novels I would strongly recommend for my friends. Dreaming simply fell into the first category, which is way I gave it only 2 stars."
4,Not a Complete Work of Art,"Wide Screen Color Bonanaza, Vincente Minnelli, Judy's hubby, known for lavish Hollywood Musicals, does a very theatrical late 1950's melodrama, almost Douglas Sirk like. Oh, the repressed sexuality and hypocracy. It's not a 50's Hitchcock masterpiece like Vertigo or To Catch a Thief, but the film's from a pot-boiler James Jones novel, takes itself pretty seriously, slicing away that exotic Indiana underbelly with Shirley MacLaine doin the cupie doll stereotype. Arthur Kennedy does not look like Frank Sinatra's brother, but he is slimey. Frank and Dean play, ah, Frank and Dean. Look, there's good scenes, despite some hokey steamy stuff.The real meat of this film, the Sinatra-MacLaine insult and love me scenes, nice work and Dean comes in for a mean-turn that's kind of believable. But the best, the Director's carnival-at-night killer shots with the pulsating brass score, that's film making. Still, all parts together, it's not complete as a work of art."
2,Not impressed,"Dave Hirsch (Frank Sinatra), an ex-soldier and writer whose best work is in his past, returns to his small-town roots only to be confronted by hypocrisy at every turn. Every element of this meandering drama is predictable and every character a stereotype. We never get under the skin of Sinatra's character to understand why he is so moody and brooding, thereby compromising his role as a foil for the community at large. It was difficult to understand the intense loyalty he provokes in the gambler Bama (Dean Martin) and the floozy Ginny (Shirley MacLaine). Magnificent work by MacLaine and supporting actor Arthur Kennedy, as Sinatra's brother, are not enough to save the film. The climax is overwrought and predictable."
3,Some Came Running,"Some Came RunningIn 1958 I was 16 years old and on a Tom Sawyer-Huck Finn trip down the Ohio River with a buddy in a little 16' boat, and we just happened to stop in Madison, Indiana where MGM was filming Some Came Running with Sinatra, Martin and MacLaine. It's typical 1950's melodrama--nothing spectacular, except for one thing--Shirley MacLaine's performance as a good-hearted, wrong-side-of-the-tracks bimbo. Spectacular! It makes the whole movie worth watching--especially the ending, which was a departure from the original script, but insisted upon by Frank, who wanted to help launch Shirley's career. It worked too! She was nominated for an Academy Award (tm)."
4,Shirley MacLaine was robbed!,"I am one of many here who's main interest in this film is from the fact that I am from the town where it was filmed. That being said, It is a great movie. Shirley MacLaine should have gotten the oscar, at least she was nominated. The movie at first look seems like a typical 1950's B movie melodrama and it is, but there is much more to it. Hang in there till about two thirds in and you will see Sinatra, Martin and Maclaine at their best ever. The DVD looks good and it took a long time for them to get this out. There is a poorly produced ""making of"" and a nice trailer in the extras. This is a must see if you are a rat pack fan. Minnelli's direction and score by Elmer Bernstein make this one of the last of the MGM classics."
2,Dissapointed in the sound.,"I am not a classical music buff but I bought Scherezade on a London Phase 4 lp by Leopold Stowkowski and the London Symphony Orchestra back in the 60's. It is one of my favorite albums. I haven't been able to find that version on CD so I decided to buy Reiner's version and Eugene Ormandy's version to see if either were close to Stowkowski's interpretation. I was very disappointed in this version. The quieter passages are so low that you have to raise the volume to hear them and then lower it again for the louder passages. Also, the violin solos, which I feel are the most beautiful parts of the piece, are difficult to hear unless you really raise the volume. The violin solos represent Scherezade and should stand out. The Eugene Ormandy version has much better sound and comes much closer to Stowkowski's version."
5,excellent,This is beautifully written book with lovely illustrations. I read a story or two each night to my daughter and we discuss possible meanings and ethical issues presented. This book is better suited for an adult reading it to the child then the child reading alone as the reading level is too complex for a young reader.
5,Kiss and Hug it,"No hooks are missing on their second album. This is a classic and belongs in every pop-punk collection. ""20 Below"" still sounds great after repeating it a thousand times. This isn't depressing emo music for wimps so kiss it and hug it and go cry somewhere else. Okay."
5,WOW!!!,"I thought their first album was good, but this one is even better. Fast riffs, great harmonies and real direction. Can't wait to see them live!!!"
3,Color of rug was a little off,"The blue colors in this rug were a little off. Otherwise, a very nice product - very soft to walk on."
3,good rug for the price,"The feel under your feet is great. The colors, however, are not as bright and fresh-looking as pictured. In fact, the colors are kind of dull - tired yellow."
2,Fragrence Review,The product is fine. The scent a little weak. The bottle is not a shape that is easy to use. Possible a little pricey.
3,A bit disappointing,"While this book is well researched and written, I found some of the ideas and info a bit outdated. It was published in the 1970's and historical cookery has come quite a way since then. While I found it a worthwhile read, I would definitely back it up with other sources."
5,How did I miss this monster ?,"I find it hard to believe, after over 30 years of listening to electric guitar players, that I am just discovering Landau now. But, better late than never ! Think of all the great players who have some Hendrix vibe to what they do-Frank Marino, Robin Trower, Scott Henderson, SRV, Eric Johnson, Julien Kasper, Jeff Beck. Some pretty stellar company imo. However, I find myself saying as I listen to Landau,""he has the strongest Hendrix vibe of any guitarist on this planet ! "" You are in for a treat if you buy this disc. I also have his first solo recording, Tales of the Bulge, but this is really where Landau shines; in a live atmosphere. Jimmy Johnson on Bass and Toss Panos on drums are both simply amazing as well. Strat lovers rejoice !"
1,not a dvd,You would think this a DVD of some of the episodes of the TV series- It is not. It is a CD
3,MNM,It was not what i expected. i use to own the original M and M game and it was a blast. i dont like not being able to see my characters. it is all first person views and i dont like that for an RPG game
5,Sooooo fun and old school,"I loooove this game. We played it when it was brand new and all the other might and magics for PC. The item came in really good condition. It did say that it came with a booklet, but it only came with that paper that covers the case. Not a serious issue, just a misunderstanding. Not something worth making a fuss over. It came playable and that is all that matters to us. Buy it and enjoy."
2,Low power,I live in NYC and there are a lot of radio stations and general RF interference.This FM transmitter seems to lack power and can't punchthrough on a channel where an existing radio station is present.
1,VIDEO PRODUCER,"I've had and have many Sony cameras, recorders, monitors, camcorders and sometimes you get a defectful one but this device is simply the worst thing holding the Sony name. Absolutely useless. It does not work in any possible way. I want my money back..... I purchased an Iriver, half the price and works perfectly well. Fifty dollars thrown to the sink................"
2,Sony DCC-FMT1 Car FM Transmitter,"Not impressed by the trasmit power - it's too weak so I often have to change frequency to catch a good signal. Also, the aerial lead is so long - it runs the length of the car and can really get in the way. I would expect better from a brand like Sony."
4,Awesome cd,I fell in love with the songs on this cd. I just wish they would tour and come to my city.
4,"Great music, crappy vocals","If there were a version of this CD with just the music and no vocals, it would be a kickass 5-star album. Their lead singer simply sucks. It hurt me to hear him botch Send Me An Angel like he did, especially since I love the synth/bass/hard rock beats they put with it (for a truly awesome version of this song, see Eurotrash by Zeromancer). Same goes for most of the songs on this CD - They have kickass beats but that guy's voice drags it down. Even so, a good industrial rock CD, worth buying if you can get it for cheap."
5,Awesome,"This is one of my favorite Dwight cds. Many catchy guitar riffs. The song that most people have heard of from it, 'Intentional Heartache' is hardly the best song, but it rules. In fact, the song Blame the Vain is one of my favorite songs of all time."
5,Dwight's best album in seven years... EXCELLENT~!!!!,"The only constant is change, and in Dwight's case, the change in band and session producers a couple of years ago has finally hit its groove with ""BLAME THE VAIN."" Every track kicks -- even the few well-placed mellow tunes -- and Dwight's legendary vocals have matured ever-so-slightly with a touch of seasoning to his attacks. This is a superb album that is likely to put Dwight back atop the C&W charts, with the prospect of a cross-over or two, such as with ""Intentional Heartache"". This is a keeper... BUY IT, you won't be sorry!"
3,Disappointing,"First of all, I'm a BIG fan of Dwight Yokem! Dwight's two most recent cd's, ""Population Me"" and ""Dwight's Used Records"" are, in my opinion, excellent even though the latter was mostly a compilation of earlier recordings. However, ""Blame the Vain"" is not in the same league as these two. Maybe it's the fact that Pete Anderson, his long time producer, was absent. There are some good tracks here, but the intro to ""Intentional Heartache"" and the track ""She'll Remember"" are two I try to forget. Better luck with the next one!"
5,best album ever,"this is just the best album I ever heard. on every album there's a track that don't sound that good as you want but on blaim the vain everything is perfect. my favorit is the titel track blaim the vain. I'll pretend rocks like the 50's. so, buys this album, you won't regret it. Dwight, your concert last year (aug 2006) in amsterdam was great, a setlist of 39 songs, it was fantastic. come back soon to the netherlands"
5,Dwight's doing what he does best.,"I highly recommend this album for any long-time Dwight Yoakam fan. Unlike with some of his albums in recent years, he's not just going through the motions resinging other people's songs. In this album, it's the real Dwight and it all sounds really good. Listen to the snippets and you'll like them all!"
5,WOW!,All I can say is WOW!This has GOT to be Dwight's best album in ages! I love every single track on this album! Way to go Dwight!
3,Disappointing for this longtime fan,"Here's the thing: Pete wasn't just a guitarist. Dwight needs someone to tell him ""uh-uh, that doesn't work"" when something doesn't work. About half the tracks (1,3,5,9,10,11,12) (okay, that's 7 out of 12 now that I look at it) are pretty solid, but they're a little pop-ish even at that. There's a little too much playing around with tempos and forms, which does more to interrupt the groove than it does to show off the band's abilities. Also, the songs themselves don't seem as strong as Dwight's best.Dwight's like McCartney or Prince, two other personal favorites, in that he needs someone to rein in his worst impulses and keep him moving ahead.I'll still listen to this, but I hope Dwight can find his focus for the next one. There are still a couple of tracks I'd put in Dwight's top-50-ever, but not the upper half of that group."
3,There was nothing on here that grabbed me,"I was, and am again, a big Dwight fan.Had his first three or four albums, loved them all until This Time swept most of his next albums under the rug, and I lost interest.Under The Covers came out, years later, and I was back in the fold, although these were not Dwight's own songs.I really loved what he did to those covers, and thought maybe he was admitting his songwriting days were over.CDs came and went, albums of original songs and covers...I didn't buy them, or even listen.Recently, after hearing a DJ talk about it, I bought Three Pairs and loved it (though not as much as This Time).That led me to go back and see if I had passed over more good albums over the many years in between.None of them have really been the type of CD that remains in the player, in the vehicle for weeks at a time.It could just be me, it takes more to get under my skin now...or is it LESS?"
5,"A Classic, one for the ages for M*A*S*H fans !","Except for why Hawkeye has a breakdown, I love this ending to a great show. I love the last 15 minutes or so the best. If you love M*A*S*H you have to have this."
4,M*A*S*H Finale,"This movie has to be the best of them all. The only complaint I have is that when I ordered it, I was asked what region I was in.Even though I said australia I still ended up with a usa version.Never mind I still luv it."
5,"For M*A*S*H addicts, 'tis heaven","While much of this is available elsewhere, this is a fun compilation and should be in the DVD library of all MASH-addicts [like me]."
4,Whatever!!,"Look - there are good and bad aspects to everything. The people who bought the entire 11 seasons of M*A*S*H in the box set got it for less, that's true -- but, they had to contend with all those discs becoming dislodged during shipment. Can you imagine having to check all those episodes for skips and other defects at once? I bought the series one season at a time, and I like it a lot better - and the discs are better protected than they are in the box set. I must confess, I was annoyed that we didn't get the discs with the outtakes, etc. So, when this came along, I bought it - it's better than having to sell all 11 episodes and buy the box set, check it for defects, and blah, blah, blah! My attitude at this point is simply this: I got what I wanted, so...WHATEVER!!- Ruth Winkler"
3,Almost twice the price as at a warehouse club,"Great set, but if you're a member of your local warehouse club (name starts and ends with 's'), you can buy it for ten bucks (as of Oct. 2012)!For that reason only, I took off two stars here. They also have all the other seasons, for ten bucks each. Hope this helps someone! :)"
1,INCREDIBLE RIP OFF !,"They make you buy every year individually with no extra's. Then they make you buy the entire show again in a box set just to get the few extra's , and now this slap in the face. I love Mash but I hate this. Fook the people at Fox ."
3,Meh,"Don't let the three stars fool you. I am a diehard M*A*S*H fan. However, this set has come in handy personally for me because my season 11 disk with this episode is irrecoverably damaged, and rather than buying season 11 again, I'll buy this instead - and get the bonus material. I'm just lucky - though I didn't think so at the time when I discovered the disk wasn't playable! - and while I'm not advocating you go out and damage your DVDs, I'd like to put in a small good word for this set. I agree, though - making the die-hard fans pay more for loyally buying all along is WRONG. WRONG."
5,I guess it kinda pays to get angry,First off let me just say I was one of the original folks who bought each season seperatly (I posted an angry reveiw for season 11) I had decided to wait to get the martinis and medicine set until I could find it used. Now with this DVD coming I will be able to complete the collection.The reason I give it 5 stars is folks like myself will be able to finally see the extras discs and complete our collections.BUT if you're going to buy it get it from Target this week as it will only run 19.99!!!I do still hate Fox home video though thats why I'm going to get it at the lowest price hehehe!
2,small fry,not proportionate to Fragglesnot as cuddly as expectedmaterials are stiff and unappealing to children.
2,doesn't satisfy expectation,"First of all, I didn't like the design, it's worse than the picture on the website. Also, the design from a practical point of view doesn't seem so good (but not so bad as the aesthetic design) such as the carrying handle and the shoulder strap. Actually, the reason I chose this product was my laptop was a Toshiba. Well, you may like it, even though you don't like it, Amazon is the best in hadling customers' complaints (you can get a full refund even without shipping)."
3,Hmmmm.,"I am baisically puzzled. I ordered the set and didn't get the product, but later I had gotten it refunded back without an explanation. Not good on delivery on the product but at least I got my money back"
3,Like this game,i have not played this game in forever!! i jsut recieved in in mail today and ima have to say i was very dissapointed at how they packaged my game to be sent to me!!!! i opened the case and i see the disc was all over the place while shipped to my house i bought the sims 2 it did not do this they shud have checked the disc first before sending it oh and one thing that bothered me i bought this and it said like new when i got it was not new it was in good condition not like new so they tricked me the cd is scratched will i ever buy from this seller? NO!!! do i recommend this game of course but make sure u get it new to last
3,"A great rent, not a great buy.","This game is fun and addicting, despite the frequent load times you have to endure, but once you've completed all the goals there's not much interest in it anymore. I would definitely recommend renting because I had a blast playing it, but after two rentals I finished all the goals and was about ready to call it quits. I definitely would not recommend buying it.Customizing your Urbz with outfits, tattoos, and piercings is fun, but be warned: every time you change districts, you have to change your outfit, and it has to be done piece by piece, reselecting all the colors, etc. This got a little annoying after a while."
3,The Urbz: Sims in the City,This game is good but it's sort of difficult because you cant be your own person you have to be who the game wants you to be and if ur not good at being some other personality then the game wont be as fun and as easy
4,Weights on Either Side,"I waited all summer to go to my friend's house for a sleepover so we could play this game all night. Do you know what we did?We played it until 2 AM.We didn't finish; we thought we should go to bed. But that just shows how darn addictive this is! Some people say that changing piece by piece for every district is boring, but I think it's fun, especially when you've never been there! We never beat the game, but I had an awesome time at the sleepover. Anyways, here is my scale:Clothes choices, going to___|___Short gameplay, loading ti-work with your sims, play-__|___mes, that rapper dude whoing head-to-head, socials,__|___doesn't like any sort ofregular sims addiction______|___social----------------------------------------------------------Hmm... Looks about equal. Well, I'd say to rent it, see if you like it, and if you like it enough, buy it."
1,The Urbz are the pits!,"I love The Sims for the pc. I thought that this game would be that experience but better. Boy was I disappointed. The game play was difficult and the loading times were looooonnngg! I just wanted a game that I could create characters in and manipulate but this is not it. Also, be sure to have lots of memory available or you won't be able to save. In conclusion, this game suc-diddily-ucked!"
2,It's okay.. For a while.,"It's a great game, but when you get everything, you realize that there's nothing to do on it anymore. It's not even fun building realtionships, getting jobs, getting promoted, and winning Drius's penthouse. I RECOMMEND THE SIMS BUSTIN OUT IT IS THE SEXIEST GAMMA EVA"
2,Eeeehhh.........,"This game was fun in the beginning. The music is awesome (I wish I could find those songs!) I love the Black Eyed Peas. But the game is.....so.....short. I was upset after I finished it. It's like ""THAT'S IT?? That can't be all that's to this game"". I seriously think Maxis could have done a better job than that. I wish I was smart at the time to rent the game,but I was so eager to play another sim game. I expected this game to have sims live more urban or street like than that. Like I heard in previous reviews, they don't have the ""attitude"" like Maxis was talking about. Don't get me wrong though. Go RENT it. It's fun, just don't expect anything after you beat it in about 3 days. And I heard they are trying to improve it by making an Urbz sequel........Hmmmmmmmmm"
3,Good but not great,The padfolio is a nice product. It is a little thin and doesn't hold as many files as I would like. I haven't owned it too long but it doesn't seem durable.
4,Almost perfect....a bit too thin.,"Well built, nice looking and smooth zipper that tucks away inside elegantly. If this thing were a 1/4 - 1/2"" thicker the pockets might actually be usable to hold something other than 3 sheets of paper. If you only need to hold a pad, a pen, and a few business cards, this thing is awesome. But if you want to bring along a magazine, a spare pen, or a thin file folder, get ready for a tight squeeze."
3,An informative read,"I agree totally with the other reviewer's comment, however, I would grade it little differently. I agree that the heroine was hard to like and the story lacked much of the romance, so two stars there. But I really enjoyed reading and learning how those labor classes were facing in that tumultuous post-war time, I gave it a four stars here, so derives my rating. I would recommend to borrow the book first before buying."
5,BEAR POND by Bruce Weber,"Bruce Weber's BEAR POND is one of the best of the male-physique photography books. The black-and-white pix are excellent and sharply focused. Too bad it was not printed on slick paper. And too bad Weber didn't do any sequels, like BEAR POND II - I'm sure thousands of people like myself would have bought it! I bought my copy - first edition - for $50.00 - good investment! Weber should do more books - he must have hundreds of photos in his files."
4,More people should see this movie!,"This is a pretty good modern take on the Prince Valiant comics. I have to say that the cast, scenery, and story are terrific! Only the special effects are a little low-grade. But on the whole, a very enjoyable lighthearted medieval movie."
5,A fun ride,"While the movie may not be the most accurate movie (i.e. armored alligators), this movie is definitely one of the best I've seen in a while. It is an excellent blend of action and fantasy, and both Moyer and Heigl give excellent performances. I can't say that I followed the strip before now, but after seeing the movie I try to pick up the comics and search it out."
4,Good Adaptation of the Comic Strip,"Having been a fan of Prince Valient for the past 30 years, I thought this was a very good adaptation of the strip. The action was well done, and Hal Fosters mood of the strip was preserved despite the hollywood-izing. I liked the ""comic maps"" which were straight from the Sunday comics, as well as Val's amazing feats -he was a medival ""super-hero""."
5,Wait for the DVD,"I loved this movie, not least because my dad used to read the comic strip to my brother and me when we were very young. It's a captivating fantasy, and the movie is light-hearted and beautifully done. Still, I'd suggest waiting for the DVD, mostly because $80 for VHS these days is absurd."
4,Waiting for the sequel,"I liked this video very much. Stephen Moyer plays Val perfectly. I've read the books (I loved them) and he was just like I imagined Valiant. The part of the princess was also very well done by Katherine Heigl. My only dissapointment was that in the comic strip Val's great love was Aleta, the beautiful heroine who with her charm and witt conquered all hearts, including Val's. I wish the lead female role would have been hers. Of course the first movie had to explain how Val came to be a knight. I hope the film company will make another one. Pitty that Katherine can't play Aleta because she would have been a great Aleta. Thank you so much for making a life long dream of seeing these caracters on screen a reality. GREAT MOVIE."
5,I think this movie rocks!,I liked it because it had humore in it and romance and lots and lots of adventure! now those are almost hard to find I thought it wouldn't be too good BUT I WAS WRONG and I think a lot of other people would like this movie too. So order it right now and I think you'll like it.
2,"Well made, but not well reasearched!","The only thing that wasn't changed from Hal Foster's wonderful epic was the hair colors of the characters. In Hal Foster's story: Prince Valiant does't become a prince by marring a princess. He was born the Prince of Thule! Arn doesn't die. Ilene dies! And whatever happend to Val's famous singing sword!!!! Next time if you are going to make a movie, read the story first. This addaptation hardly gives enough credit to Foster's great works!"
5,Hate is My Neighbor,"An extraordinary, but true account of combating hate and prejudice in Northern Idaho, that reads like a novel. I could not put it down! This is Wassmuth's own story of organizing a community against bigotry, and violence. His courage and commitment made him the target of an Aryan Nations bombing attack on his own home, but that did not stop him. He went on to found the Northwest Coalition Against Malicious Harassment, and served as its executive director for 10 years."
2,review,"There were sections of this book that I found offensive. She analyzes certain poems drawing from stereotypes placed on specific groups of people. In one poem i read, she assumed the characters were black because of the way they talked."
1,No Help for Anyone Interested in Superior Contemporary Poetry,"As ever, venerable Establishment icon Vendler pays standard attention to varieties of poetry standard by the fifties or earlier, but seems unaware that anything else (visual, infraverbal and mathematical poetry, for instance) exists. She's competent at what she limitedly does, however, so her book would probably be worth getting for apprentice readers and writers of poetry--until commercial or academic publishers of books like hers accidently publish one by someone knowledgeable about the best poetry composed since 1950."
4,Helen Vendler is amazing.,"I bought this book for a class that I am taking with Professor Vendler herself. Her love and deep understanding of poetry really come through in her writing, and makes you want to read more. She presents ideas that you may not have thought of yourself, and you eventually find yourself looking at poems in a new way (especially if you're a novice, like myself. The only con, I might say, is that the organization can seem a bit haphazard: she doesn't seem to address poems in any particular order within chapters, and the transitions between poems and their analysis is very abrupt, which can be jarring. I don't think that I will be selling this back at the end of the semester; this book is a gem worth keeping for pure enjoyment of poetry (there is a very healthy-sized anthology at the end of the book, as well as a mini one at the end of each chapter)."
5,Tremendous exciting radio for Superman fans of ALL ages!,"The serial is regarded as the greatest story line in all of juvenile kids radio. And it lives up to that lofty billing. Superman vs. Atom Man is truly exciting radio, well written and extremely well acted. Bud Collyer as Superman/Clark Kent and Mason Adams as Henry Miller/The Atom Man are superb. Just exciting radio that would be great for the entire family to listen to."
1,Very Overated,"I have purchased the CD version of this Radio Series and I have to say that the only worthwile feature of these episodes in the sound quality. Having said that the serial is [very weak].I was so disgusted by it that I have thrown the lot in the dustbin where they belong. a total waste of money if ever.There is no music or intro music to set the mood and pace of the serial and the sound effects are hopeless. As a real fan of both radio and film serials I have to say the Superman Vs. Atom Man is the most useless series I have come accross,... The only reason I have given this CD set 1 star is because I have no choice if I am to get my views on this site."
2,Save Your Money for a Real TPOK CD,"The only other marvelous TPOK is Youlou. I think Youlou married Franco's sister (does anybody know this for sure?) and that probably helped him get acquire franchise name. Youlou didn't need it, though, he just is excellent. These guys needed it because without it you wouldn't go near this record.Back to this record. It is not a deep record. Like soukous, it has a surface that looks pretty but runs shallow. This is not quite as bad as soukous and ndombolo, though. If a copy comes up for under ten bucks, maybe give it shot, but you won't miss anything if you don't.There are a few toe-tapping numbers that would sound good if you heard the radio or at a party, but, so what? There is a lot of wasted talent on this record and it's ashamed that Franco's musicians and singers couldn't dig deeper. The first song is the same as the seventh song. Yes you read that right. Franco and TPOK wrote 2 songs a week for over 30 years and Franco wrote half those songs himself."
5,Extremely useful internet book.,Lots of interesting facts I never knew about the internet. Made my internet experience a lot more enjoyable and productive than I ever imagined!
5,Great for the boatless!!,"Great for the shore fisherman!! Affordable to. Those that don't own a boat or just prefer shore fishing. Put her on a spare rod with some good line and hunt while you fish. It has an extra hole where you can rig it like a bobber if yer willing to risk it (against bigger fish), don't think I goin to risk that though."
4,smartcast,Great item advice for everybody who is fishing by rod from small boat or from land. Will better if they could make it show the size of the fish but still working good it worse it money.
1,Does not work!,The temp. and depth was way off if you could get it even display. The temp. showed 76 degrees after taking tap water putting into a 5 gal bucket. The depth from the dock showed 56 feet when actual depth was less than 4 feet.
4,Humming Bird Wristwatch Sonar,"If you want to have fun get this gadget! It not only works but will keep you entertained when the fish aren't biting:) Remember, even if you find the fish they don't just jump in the boat:) I would recommend this item as a gift that any fisherman would love to receive. Read the directions thoroughly and play with it before you really are in your fishing mood as it takes awhile to figure out. Change chanels if you don't pick up a signal right away. The contrast indoors is nothing like outside so don't judge it when you first take it out of the box. you'll be able to see the dial just fine outside in natural light. Also, you won't be able to read the dial with polarized sun glasses on. Have fun!"
1,VERY VERY VERY VERY BAD PRODUCT !!!!,"LOOKING AT THE HUMMINGBIRD WRIST MOUNT , I REALLY THOUGHT THAT THIS WOULD BE AN AWESOME PRODUCT ,,,,, TAKE IT FROM ME IT ISN'T NOT ONE BIT !!!!! ONE THE RANGE ON THE UNIT IS ABOUT 15FEET , THAT SUCKS >> HOW DO YOU USE SOMETHING THAT HAS A RANGE OF 15FEET MY BLUETOOTH HAS BETTER RANGE LOL ITS A JOKE ,, BUT THIS IS DECEIVING BECAUSE AMAZONS DETAIL STATES THAT THE UNIT GOES UP TO 150FEET WHITCH IS LIEEEEEEE !!!! IF YOU GO TO HUMMINGBIRDS WEBSITE YOU WILL CLEARLY SEE THAT IT ONLY GOES TO 75FEET BUT STILL THIS IS A LIE !!!! I GO OUT FISHING LIKE AT LEASE 2 TIMES A WEEK AND IVE NEVER BEEN SO DISAPPOINTEDPOINT BEING SAID !!!!! DON'T BUY THIS ITEM TAKE IT FROM ME >> YOU WILL BE VERY DISAPPOINTED !!!"
1,Not Working.,"I received the Item on Monday 18th 2013.I try to switch it on, but it doesnt work, i've bought an new batterie,but there was no change.So i send it back from germany for refund.Never again."
1,Not Good,"Did not work ! and l know how to use it ,l had three other ones. to much hassel to send back.Dont BUY"
5,Very pleased.,"It was a birthday gift to my friend. He loves it. He likes everything, the receiver with a display attaches to a pole is very sturdy. And the main thing IT SHOWS FISH. Even if you can't catch it at least you know you at the right spot and can try different things to fool fish."
3,It works,"I waited awhile to write this so that I would know where it worked and where it did not. Simply it works, just has no distance for the radio transmitter, you could never use it at the end of a fishing line like it says more than 10 feet away from the receiver and it loses its connection, so I am using it on my little pontoon boat and it works well for that and its compact enough to still have room to carry your tackle box."
1,disappointed,bought this for my son's Master's Graduation the end of August--he tried it on the lake in back of his house. it only worked within 10' of the shore and boat. we were very disappointed in the result of product use as it seemed like the perfect answer to convenience for an avid fisherman.
4,Fun little toy!,"This little gadget has been a great addition to my fishing gear. My boys (8, 5 and 3) usually get bored to quickly but with this attached they are fascinated with the display and will sit and fish with me longer.It is a great tool when crappie fishing from the dock and we've even used it in a slow drift for catfish with it attached to the boat, works great as long as the drift is slow or we're anchored.My husband got this for me for my birthday, I was thrilled and so was he! I write a weekly fishing report for a looal lake and the fish locator on our boat is mounted for the driver. He say's before he bought me the Hummingbird, I was driving him crazy - how deep is it, do you see anything, why is it beeping now? now how deep is it?"" With the Hummingbird, I can collect the information I need to share with my readers about depths where the fish are biting at and water temps and maintain the peace and quiet we love about fishing!"
4,Great for the price,"I've now had this little guy for a year and with the exception of the green transducer dying in the first week (replaced immediately by Humminbird), it works like a charm. It's been in both frest and salt water repeatedly without a hiccup. I've had it in as much as 60 feet with fairly good resolution, discerning between weeds, rocks and fishwell for the price. Great little unit for the money, for sure-especially if you have a kayak like me. You won't be disappointed."
1,Waste of money,"Total waste of money, I recieved this as a gift and it did'nt work at all. Changed the battery on it and it still didn't work. Unfortunately I don't live in the U.S. so I can't return it without a high shipping cost, otherwise I would have instead of throwing it in the garbage.Thanks a lot Hummingbird."
3,Craving for something more,"I bought this book because I wanted to know how this great series ended. Was I disappointed? A tab bit. There were several prominent figures from pervious novels that weren't even mention like Aisling Sturbridge, Isabel Giovanni, or Khalil. There's no written note, e-mail, or confession. Guess we have to make them up ourselves.If you want, buy the book for some easy reading but don't expect much. This book was suppose to coincide w/ the storyline on the recently release game Bloodlines, especially concerning the Anarch Smiling Jack."
3,A bit disappointed,"I just finished reading Gehenna. This is the first Vampire novel I've actually read. Having read as much as I can about the metaplot from the roleplaying books, I was a bit disappointed in the ending.Like a previous reviewer, I wanted more questions answered. I wanted concrete answers to all of the ""myths"" about kindred society.That doesn't take away from the fact the author, in my opinion, did a great job with writing the novel. The descriptions he used, especially describing the beast and how it reacted to stressful situations, was great."
4,1994 Grease Broadway w/ 1995 Tracks feat. Brooke Shields,"It's definitely not the movie, but you should have taken the hint when you read ""Broadway.""In a lot of ways, the Broadway performance is better. There is more of a story to it, and therefore more songs. The performers sound surprising good, especially the voices of ""Sandy"" and ""Danny"". Brooke Shields can sing, but I can't help but feel that ""Rizzo"" needs a more gutteral, edgey voice.Overall, this is a great performance, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for either a Grease recording or just a good musical."
5,Grease,This is a great soundtrack it is fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best songs on this soundtrack are all of them. if you have not listened to this soundtrack then i recommend you do
4,dog toy,Our Basset Hounds enjoy playing with this toy. It helps keep them occupied during the day. I would recommend it.
4,So far so good,My 8 month old labradoodle can chew through most toys in seconds. He has yet to gnaw this one apart. He runs around the house making it moo. I think the sound occupies him enough that he doesn't destroy it.
5,Love it.,"My greyhound Taz loves this toy, fairly indistructable....Please make more, I will order another soon. Makes a great noise!"
2,Not as good as others,"I have several of the multipet look who's talking toys, was disappointed with this one (cow dog toy). Did not seem as though the quality was as good as the others and the ""sound box"" was sideways. I got it shifted a bit but it would not stay in place. Arrived quickly."
5,Moooooo,Mooey is a new toy in our house but a second multipet. The quality of this item is wonderful. He sounds like a real cow. Jakey loves him but since I work nights and sleep during the day he can only play with it in the evening for the cow is very loud. Looking forward to Christmas for I will buy other Multipet toys as presents for my dog and son's dogs.Can't beat the price and the quality.
5,Fun dog toy,"This item appears to be well made, especially for the price offered. The item is newly purchased, so thelongevity cannot be assessed as yet. It was enjoyed by several small dogs. It would not hold up for medium or larger dogs."
3,Cow toy,"My Shiba Inu loved the cow until it stopped mooing - it's pretty much lost its' charm for him since then (about three days!) -- I'm going to stick to the stuffed toys with squeakers -- they're cheaper and even when he de-stuffs them, he still looks for them in his toy basket!"
1,Not for my dog...,"I returned this before I even let my dog see it. I may have missed it in the description, but there is a large square, plastic box (I'm assuming battery powered) inside the toy that makes it ""mooo"". Simply put, if I wouldn't chew on it...my dogs not going to chew on it. That box inside is all corners and I can't imagine it being fun to chew on."
5,Dog's favorite toy,My large lab loved this toy. It was a favorite for a long time ( until he destroyed it ). I am actually surprised it lasted as long as it did because he played with it a lot!
2,Tail Shreds 1st Hour,The tail shredded shortly after my Russell started chewing. Could choke a small dog or cause other health issues. Would not recommend this toy.
4,I Love This Movie!,"This is one of the few vampire movies I could watch again and again. It's not very gory but it's very entertaining nonetheless. It stars Jason London, and he plays his role as that of vampire-who-doesn'-t know-he's-a-vampire very well. Blood Ties has its very funny moments as well (I'm not sure they were supposed to be that funny...). Get this movie today. Happy watching!"
3,Views more like a murder drama than a vampire movie...,"Frankly, I'm surprised it even got an R rating. The story isn't half bad, except they break the cardinal rule that vampires can't exist in the daylight. In most ways they don't even seem like vampires--just a strange branch of humanity who can feed on blood when riled enough. Anyway, don't expect any nudity. What scenes there are could probably be boadcast without censorship, in my opinion. The violence must be what makes it restricted, but again compared to most vampire movies of today, the violence is very tame.If you're looking for a borderline R vampire flick to watch with teen members of the family, this is it. Enjoy the tale. But, hardcore horror fans will think this extremely disappointing...."
5,Excellent Thriller!!,This is an excellent thriller starring Louis Gossett Jr. about the prison abuse and torture that happened during apartheid in South Africa.It's a must see!!
5,EL AMOR VERDADERO ES LO MAS PURO,"Por suerte, me tope con este libro...y sin creer mucho, y más bien por ociosa,me puse en acción..¡AH, CARAY ! Se me saltaban los ojitos cuando, en pocos días, Luis regresó a casa con cambios que nunca me imagine!"
4,Tremendous Help,"I loved the stories that were written up in the book. There were some really creative ones in there. None of them seemed just right for our relationship though.I was also looking for some advice on proposal ettiquette, getting permission from the in-laws, picking out rings, etc. but this book didnt have it.I did get a lot of great info at the website howtoproposemarriage. comGood luck you your proposal. She said yes to mine!..."
1,Very Disappointing,"After all the hype I'd looked forward to this book. However, it was a real disappointment.When he wasn't contradicting himself he was rewriting sections of his own or other's work. There were no new concepts or ideas in here, nor much about what you were supposed to do with the ones he did suggest.It sort of read like a Tom Peters book, only without the energy, enthusiasm or vision.Bottom line: avoid."
4,A little dated but very insightful.,"Provided an in-depth discussion of trends in the information technology industry and their impact on organizational culture. The book is a little dated. However, the topics are very insightful."
4,Very Useful,"As a manager of a small (currently) catalog start-up, I was searching for an up to date book that neatly summarized using ""virtual techniques"" to streamline business operations. It was slow reading since I came up with so many ideas to apply and needed to take notes. I am writing this review since a rating of 2 that I saw here greatly suprised me. I found Martin's style to my liking"
3,Why only 2 prong outlets??,"I'm using this with aLowel Pro-light, Focusing Multi-voltage Quartz Light, 12v, 30v, 120v; 50-250wfor a photographic lighting setup.This thing works well as a dimmer, but I seriously don't understand why they didn't use 3 prong connectors. I had to buy a 3-2 prong converter. I also wish that, instead of a cord, it just had one of those standard three prong female power connectors (like the sort you see on monitors and desktop computer power supplies) so I could inline the thing up closer to where my light is. As it is now I have to keep it with it's own cord's reach of an AC outlet.Hope I don't need that grounding wire for anything...."
3,Wow i can still buy this?!,"Very much like the other review I saw, risk.You build units, each with different skills or abilities and movement.You get to employ magic and gain powerful items that help you improve your empire and crush your enemies.Also hero units which you can carry one or so with you between matches that will help a lot.Also found a bug, if you save your game, then reload it, it gives you a whole turn of magic regeneration.Enjoy."
3,Hit ....or Miss?,"Just heard the entire cd and again, from my own opinion as a club dj, this may create only a spark but never a bonfire. The only mix that can get any club play is the future force remix."
3,Witty and Quirky,"Marti Leimbach is a witty, entertaining writer -- the kind of person you'd like to be sitting next to on your next trans-Atlantic flight. ""Love and Houses"" has some compelling characters to give a unique spin on this timeworn topic, but there's no ""there,"" there. The book lacked substance, and I could never forget I was reading the product of someone's imagination. Still, worth a read for the quirky characters and great humor."
1,"This product is ""7"" YEARS OLD !!",I called Almay cosmetics to purchase additional creams and was told Almay stopped making ALL their skincare creams in 2005.I notified Amazon and Beautytime 2 months ago that they were selling old product. They were to investigate! I just received this offer to write a review!I didn't ask for a refund - just wanted to avoid someone having a reaction from using an out-dated product.
4,Sixth in the series,"This book is the sixth in the Mitchell and Markby series, and the series just seems to keep getting better. These are true English village mysteries with colourful casts of characters, deft plotting and a tricky little mystery to figure out. In this book a young girl's body is found lying in a ditch and Markby has to figure out what happened. We have Meredith Mitchell now living in Bamford, so that puts her right in the thick of things. When she befriends a troubled teenage girl, she doesn't realize that it puts her right in the middle of a murder investigation. She works with Inspector Markby to try to bring a killer to justice. This is really a delightful pair of sleuths, and I am really enjoying this series."
4,Read this Book First,"Well written, and best read before reading ""Clear the Bridge."" While this is a book I highly recommend, it only got four stars because it wasn't quite as good as ""Clear the Bridge."""
5,Wahoo,One of the most exciting and realistic books of maritime warefare during World War II. This is a book that will really keep you on the edge of your seat. Really a book you wont want to put down.
5,"Thanks, Submariners",I've read Richard O'Kane's book on the Tang and this book on the Wahoo and they are the best book on submarines I've ever read. Thank goodness America had men like O'Kane and Mush Morton in WW II. I was in the Navy and I've toured WW II subs and modern nuclear subs and there is no way I would have served on a sub. Entirely too small for me plus they went under water! O'Kane's books are like being on a sub with the best docent conducting the tour.
4,Wahoo by Richard O'Kane,"Read the book with keen interest in the personalities of the various Captains. Such men as Morton and O'Kane are true American heros and left me thinking of them days after finishing the book. I couldn't help but think that when Dick O'Kane was on his death bed at age 83, that certainly Mush Morton appeared to him and said ""any time Dick"". These men must have been extremely frustrated by placing their fellow shipmates in dire danger to only have torpedo after torpedo be a dud, and worse yet to have one sink their own boats."
4,Wahoo,"Being an Australian WW2 sailor who served in the Pacific with the American Navyit was a good readIt was factual, a good story and a good read, Aussie sailor WW21"
2,Not what I expected,"Being a retired naval officer and former submariner, I was very familiar with Dick O'Kane's exploits on Wahoo during WWII. I thought this book would really tell his story, but in my opinion it did not. The story is certainly there, but this book is so poorly written that I couldn't get past Chapter 3. An editor who had submarine experience and an experienced co-writer or ghost writer would have helped also. Each page left me with a feeling that there was more to be said, things just weren't complete.CAPT O'Kane seems to leave out much of the technical explanations of the submarine and how it is operated. Maybe things get a little better further down the line, but right now I'm not going to waste my time finding out. I'll just sit back and remember this courageous submarine captain based on what I knew prior to trying to read this book."
3,Good story about a WWII submarine,Not the best book I've read about this subject but a good story anyway.
3,"LIght, powerful, attachments won't connect","Got this back in March. For the price, one would expect all the attachments could be used in combination. They included an adaptor, but you cannot get several of the tools to attach to the extension tubs no matter how many configurations you try. Also, manual is worthless, and it tells you will need to purchase additional bags/filters to use the vac. The good - light and powerful unit, nice long hose. Would be nice if there was a carrier with wheels so you could roll it around instead of picking it up and moving it."
4,Does the job,"I needed a vac to keep the patio carpet clean of debris. This one works for me. My only complaint is the ""press and fit"" hose attachments. Although the vac includes a wall mount bracket, it did not include a hose/accessory storage attachment which I found a bit annoying. A longer hose would have been nice too."
5,Great product,Great product great price delivered free in 4 days.Could have been improved by including an upholstery brush as it is designed to be used in the garage/car.
1,"Clogges Often, Attachments Don't Attach","Where to star, I bought this because I wanted to hang it on the wall in my garage and not have to worry about moving it around, dragging it behind me. However most of the attachments that it comes with do not even fit on the end of the hose or pipe attachments, not really sure what this is about, but makes them pretty worthless. It can barely handle small leaves that blew into your garage or pine needle droppings without the hose clogging every few minutes. It works well with saw dust for the first 10-15minutes or so and then the internal filter clogges and the suction is greatly reduced. Guess I will be trading this in for a true Dust Collector. Was really excited and had high hopes for this shop-vac."
2,This vac is an aggrevating pain,"This vac: a)has such small wheels that it cannot be rolled/pulled over its own power cord, b)has lower than rated suction, c)hard to use tools. Basically, its a toy."
1,Poor Packaging,"I haven't even tried the product yet, but I can't reccomend it based on the terrible (non-exsistant) packaging. All the parts were literally thrown in a box with no styrofoam, peanuts.....NOTHING. Everything just banged around and scratched everything up. What a shame."
3,Reasonable Not outstanding,"The machine was bought to use in a small engine repair shop. It works, with the following annoyances.1. The User Manual is missing description of how to attach the tool caddy that is to be attached to the vacuum. In fact the tool caddy is not described in the user manual at all.2. The design of the wall mount is sufficient to get the machine off of the floor. It does not have facilities for all tools (e.g., it is missing a hose hanger {you wrap the hose around the vacuum)).3. The fit of the tools is sufficient, but not exact. You need to pressure the standard wand to get it to fit.4. For a supposed 5.5 hp machine, its lifting power does not appear to be any better than 3 hp machines.I will keep it, it is functional, but I am not pleased with the purchase."
3,Beware peak HP ratings,"This wet-dry vac has been reliable, but it has much less power than some of the others I've used. I was hopeful, as I need a powerful vac, but not a large reservoir, and this seemed to fit the bill, but the avg. power is well below peak."
4,Great space saverthat works,"I havent used it for wet purpose yetvbut, It has a lot of power in a compact design. Every thing stores nice and neat with plenty of hose. I use it in the garage for shop type work."
4,one problem...,nice....one thing...would be great if they issued it on vinyl as well. a lot of these tracks are hard to find.late
3,Solid Dancing but Spotty,"This two disc set is a great value if you can get it discounted, as I did -- lots of deep house and trance with slamming grooves, with the trance being on the anthemic and obvious side. For those who like their collections a bit cooler (i.e. Sasha and Digweed's Northern Exposure stuff, or even Oakenfold), this collection will seem a bit too heavy on the boogie. I find I'm divided -- quite a bit of good, danceable stuff on Disc One in particular, but a LOT of cheese as well. Mixes are tight and hot, but again, with such a high cheese factor, I pretty much put this one on only when I'm working out -- even for getting psyched for clubbing, this one is too monotonous."
2,waste of money!,"i didnt buy this album cuz i wanted to listen to it first...which is where nap comes in. the album had a nice intro, then completely went the opposite direction. i hear people talking about ""where i belong alot"", but to me this song is weak. ja rule on the track was just annoying. ""farmers""...another weak track that people has been praising about. then we have song with kelly price and carl thomas, and again this fell flat on ll face. ""imagine that""...which you people has heard all over mtv, is just another weak track that it suppose to appeal to a wider audience, i guess i wasnt apart of that audience. this album is close to being garbage....the songs wasnt all wack, it was just fell way below what i expect for an album that is called ""Greatest Of All Time"". if you are wise then dont get this album....you will be disappointed beyond your imagination."
5,G.O.A.T.,"This album is very good. I never have yet listened to the the intro but 2 all the way to the end is wonderful. G.O.A.T is good but it could do without that buzzing sound. The songs that will probably become a classics are numbers 2, 3, 14, 15, 6, 7, thats just in my opinion. Number three really really disses Canibus. What I most like about this cd is all of its guest artists. Man its about time he had some people on his cd. It features Method Man, Ja rule, Amil, Snoop Dogg, X to the Z, and more. So if you are a real hip-hop fan the I suggest you buy it."
4,LL Cool J mixes his phat rhymes and beats,"LL Cool J is the Greatest of all time. He reaches back to his old school rootes and combines his rhyming with phat beats. ""This is us"" featuring Carl Thomas is one of the best songs on this cd. It has dope beat, good lyrics and Carl Thomas, the ladies man. I give this cd two thumbs up. LL Cool J is still hard as ice."
4,Its A Hit,Well first off we should start of by saying that by far this is LL best album in ten years. Overall his album is tight and u can basically flow to most of his songs.There arent too many MCs that can last as long as LL.He can still put hits and he can still destroy MC's just ask Canibus.As for the title itself. LL is definitely one of the best rappers to ever bless the mike.However is he the best ever. That will always be upto debate. None the less LL has been doing it since the 80's and he always manages to sell records so that definitely tells u about his rapping skills..Without a doubt i recommend this album and at the end of the year we will see that this Album was one of the best of the year 2g.....
4,What is this?????,"LL Cool J is definitely a great rapper, very smooth and has always had his own style, but in this effort he spends too much time trying to answer his critics charge that he has always catered to the women and he is not hard enough. So what, he has sold millions of CDs based on that style and has more cash in the bank than most of his critics combined. He just needs to stick to what works and not suddenly try to go gangsta on his flow to appease the idiots that couldn't drop lyrics if their life depended on it."
2,waste of money!!!!!!!!!!!!,"i didnt buy this album cuz i wanted to listen to it first...which is where nap comes in. the album had a nice intro, then completely went the opposite direction. i hear people talking about ""where i belong alot"", but to me this song is weak. ja rule on the track was just annoying. ""farmers""...another weak track that people has been praising about. then we have song with kelly price and carl thomas, and again this fell flat on ll face. ""imagine that""...which you people has heard all over mtv, is just another weak track that it suppose to appeal to a wider audience, i guess i wasnt apart of that audience. this album is close to being garbage....the songs wasnt all wack, it was just fell way below what i expect for an album that is called ""Greatest Of All Time"". if you are wise then dont get this album....you will be disappointed beyond your imagination."
2,ll cool j?,"this showed me exactly what not to do, i mean im sure i guy would like to like to hang around laidies all the time, but i just dont like his music i do not get it."
4,NO MORE DEF JAM !,"IN THE LATEST NEWS ON LL COOL J IS HE IS LEAVING DEF JAM.BUT LL IS GOING TO RECORD 1 LAST ALBUM BEFORE HE GOES OUT AND SIGNS WITH ANOTHER LABEL.THAT ALBUM IS EXPECTED MID-2001.LL COOL J ISN'T THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME ""G.O.A.T."".THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME IS TUPAC SHAKUR.I GIVE LL ALOT OF CREDIT BUT NOT THAT MUCH TO CALL HIM G.O.A.T. ."
2,This album is G.O.A.T cheese...,"It had been quite sometime since I had splurged and bought a Cool J album. Not since ""14 Shots to the Dome"" which appeared on the scene back in '93. Thats the last time I laid down scrilla on an LL album. Maybe it should have been the last. I heard LL hype up this album so much. That it was his best yet. That he had probably the most control over this album than of any he had ever put out. Well L, if thats the case UR in trouble bro'. This is one of the most disappointing CDs I have bought to date. I hope this isn't UR best s**t LL because if it is then its time for U to put that microphone in a time capsule. And for U to retire."
1,This CD Sucked. Sooo Bad,"Don't spend your money on this CD. Sure LL Cool J has talent, and he has good songs, there just not on this CD. Imagine That was good, but not good enough to make me reccomend anyone to buy this CD. Wait til it comes out on a compilation disk. All the other song's music sounds just like the others, and same with the beats, and lyrics. The Greatest of all time got old in two days, and i havent had it in my changer sense. Looking for a good CD? Try Mystikal, Eminem, or Nelly. I hope you just don't shrug this warning off."
2,Legend yes G.O.A.T. Hell NAW,"We all know L.L. Cool J is a legend in the game,but he can't be consider the g.o.a.t in hip hop. Yes L.L. has classic songs but no classic album. Name 1 L.L. album that was better the B.I.G. ""Ready 2 die"",Nas's ""illmatic"", 2pac's""me against the world"". and public enemy ""it takes a mill...."".Let not forget that Rakim change the whole face of hip hop w/""paid in full"" Now on the album, I tried 2 give L.L. a chance but it seem 2 me that he trying 2 get get the Jay-z & Dmx fans.He doesn't seem like he being himself. How many song can a person do about freaky girls? how many times i have 2 hear how many m.c.'s u rip? come on there no real metaphors or any punchline that make me want 2 rewind that. Yes L.L. is a legend but untill he deliver a classic like Krs-one, Rakim(G.O.A.T), Kool G rap, 2PAC, and Nasty nas he can't claim 2 be the G.O.AT."
2,Overrated and not deserving of the greatest,"I have heard everything when it comes to rap music. From the greatest to the worst. And when I say the greatest I definately don't mean L.L. Cool J. I think by naming his CD The Greatest Of All Time he has completely disrespected Bone Thugs n Harmony and the Wu Tang Clan. I only felt two of the songs on this album, Homicide and Queens Is because Prodigy is in that one. I don't see how he can have so much confidence, all he has to do is listen to his own album and see that it is nowhere near the greatness of other artists. It's okay to have some level of confidence but you should be able to back it up, and all I can say is that this album definately, without a doubt, is nowhere near the greatness of E.1999 Eternal or Enter the 36 Chambers."
1,A Rip-Off Indeed,"I totally agree that this DVD is a rip-off. Joe Vitale never gives more than the mearest hint of the subjects he speaks of. I assume this is because that's all he can say to avoid plagarism since most of what he does have to say are things already stated by others, many with whom he has a marketing relationship. There are some great teachers in ""THE SECRET"". Joe is not one of them. As the prior review suggests, thumb through some of his books in a bookstore and see for yourself."
1,"Let's Exploit The ""New Age Prosperity Seekers""",Joe is NOT a great marketer. He's good. He is perceived as great because he's chosen an easy market...law of attraction junkies. The truth is you can read several books on this and learn what you need to know. Here's the real secret...Stop Buying More Stuff In Search of the MISSING Secret. Only then will people stop selling you more. Everything you need to know about the law of attraction can be found in the Abraham-Hicks book/cds. And for a nominal cost compared to what everyone else is charging. Go to the source of the information.
3,It was OK,"Like I said, it was OK.. I was expecting something more.. not sure what, but something more. Belief systems, I learned this 25years ago. Just a reminder again, said differently.."
2,Lazy Filmmaking,"I was quite disappointed with this film. The director used some non-actors to play some of the parts, and it shows. Also, the editing and camera work is shoddy. In one particular scene, you see Mouchette turning her body, which causes a coffee cup to move toward the edge of the table. In the next shot, the cup falls to the floor. The effect is very self-conscious and clumsy. Finally, the actress playing the girl fails to convince us of her state of mind that occurs at the fim's end. Perhaps other viewers may like it."
3,Self-indulgent for the cast and crew,"There is nothing in this movie that will entertain you. Students of cinema rejoice. You can observe fine acting, fine directing and fine cinamatography but you will not be distracted by the story. 5 stars for performances, etc; 1 star for the telling of a foreboding story of despair and 0 stars for entertainment. I typcally appreciate Bresson and seem to understand the movies...not Mouchette. Maybe the trailer said it all...""a colour movie; in colours of black and in colours of white""."
2,Author Focus on Wrong Party,"Through out the entire book, Sacks finds fault only with the students, but what about the teachers? I grauated in May of this year, and I never experience students who didn't want to work for grades, but I did experience instructors who: 1) often didn't come to class 2)gave multiple choice exams (I even had one in a writing class!) 3)would cut class short so he could ""meet my new tennis partner"" 4)grade papers in class and on class time 5)socially chat with selected students in class and on class time about personal business that didn't relate to the class 6)didn't meet durning posted office hours 7)hadn't updated the sylabus in years.Complaining about these instructors is useless. They usually have tenure, and administration is unable to do anything.Now that the author has tenure, I wonder how many classes he misses."
1,A Conservative Subterfuge,"This text, onstensibly an ""eye-opening"" account of college students in the '90s, instead is a loosely veiled call for conservative educational reforms. Hiding behind a pseudonym, and refusing to reveal his real college, this former teacher perpetuates the myths of the stereotypical ""Gen Xer."" By the end, ""Sacks"" is making calls for ""some minimal restrictions on access to higher education"" under the guise of improving student minds. This is exactly the kind of coverage that will wind up costing the real, talented, diligent GenerationX their futures."
3,Interesting but stereotypical,"As a Generation Xer myself, I recognized much of my classmates behavior in this book. I can recall many instances of people who were unwilling to work hard for their grades.However, I think Peter Sacks and some of the other reviewers need to remember what a couple of the students said to Sacks at the end of his book. These hardworking students implored him to not just focus on the students who were wasting everyone's time. Not everyone under the age of 25 has a problem with high standards. People need to remember there are students, myself included, who want to be challenged. I understand it is difficult not to become disillusioned. It may help to remember you do have some students who will work hard to stretch their imaginations and intellects if you challenge them to do so."
5,A Realistic Look at College Instruction Today,"This is one of the best books on contemporary teaching and learning methods that I have seen so far, especially for those college instructors who are trying to reach today's college students -- the so-called Generation X. Educational fads and theories aside, the classroom is where learning begins to take place. The author shares his experiences and his teaching techniques on a personal basis, which is refreshing. Readers should bear in mind that while the author advocates a technique of combining teaching and entertainment, his continued emphasis on teaching is a distinction which does not come through as clearly as it might have done. A worthwhile book for college instructors (and their deans) whether old or new. I have reccomended it to all of my faculty"
1,It's fiction.,"This book is by a pseudonymous author at an unnamed college. Give me a break. He gets tenure in three years with no previous experience teaching in a college. I have been a teacher for 29 years, ten in a community college. While I sympathize with much of what he says and I do think that the book is well-written, the author is really playing that old game of ain't it a shame. He takes almost no responsibility for his poor teaching. After years of being a journalist, why does he think that his trip to the classroom would be a breeze? He's an elitist unwilling to do the heavy lifting required of a community college teacher."
4,great for rehab,"I picked this up after breaking my ankle as a rehab tool. It's fantastic for exercises and has really helped a lot. I would recommend getting this package because while the cushion is fantastic, the roller can be terrifying. The cushion lend itself to a whole workout routine including upper body (it comes with DVDs), but the roller is just side to side. I like it and use it from time to time, but it seems like it's more likely to injure than to help =)."
5,"Great, simple fun","This is a great product to have in your living room. I jump on it from time to time, burn some quick calories, and keep my balance strong/keen. As I said, it's a great product to have and keep on the living room floor. I also recommend having some sort of rug underneath, maybe something cheap from Ikea."
1,don't buy from BC Surf & Sport,"This is probably a great product if you can actually get it. I ordered back on Dec 20th because it was supposedly in stock at BC Surf. My credit card was promptly charged but I never got the item. To date there is no tracking number posted. I have filed both a ""where's my stuff"" and a claim through Amazon and called BC Surf 3 times. Customer service sees the order and agrees it hasn't shipped even though it is in stock. They can't explain it and apparently can't get their warehouse to respond. If you want this product, order it direct from the manufacturer or try to find a retailer. Any $ I would have saved ordering online has been more than spent through my time. And I still don't have the product or even a tracking number."
5,Outstanding,"The board is great. Arrived in good condition with all accessories as advertised. Recommend to anyone interested in balance training. If you haven't used one before, I suggest using on the carpet before on a hard surface. The carpet slows down the movement. Also, have a close support at first. The key is to relax and don't look down."
5,Great Product So Far,"We've had the Indo Board for a couple of days now and it's addicting. I've been on it daily just working on my balance. What an amazing workout you get just from balancing on a board and a cylinder/pad. Definitely enjoying this one.BTW, it looks awesome too."
4,Must reading: Wallenberg is Here,"I have just read this fascinating historical novel by Carl Steinhouse. Having read many other materials on Nazism and the treatment of Jews in my teaching career, I have found the information, settings, and characters to be carefully portrayed. In the section on Auschwitz, I had to recall the feelings I experienced in visiting the site. While there, I tried to place myself in the role of one of the victims arriving by train and living in one of the barracks until my death. The author does give a realistic portrayal of the fate of so many humans. One must admire Wallenberg for the risks he took and the creative ways he used to help the Jews in Hungary. The author has presented the material in an easy to read and easy to follow manner. The book is one when you start reading it, you will stay up late into the night because Steinhouse has written a most interesting book on an important series of events in our history."
4,Gripping,"This is a very moving book. In describing the day to day existence of Raoul Wallenberg during the period of his face-off against Eichmann and the Hungarian anti-semites, it defines heroism. To those of us who have been fortunate to live our lives in this country, this book provides a valuable reminder that sometimes one individual who commands moral authority by virtue of his own actions can mobilize the people around him to great bravery."
5,WALLENBURG IS HERE!,I THOUGHT I WAS FAIRLY KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THE HOLOCAUST UNTIL I READ THIS BOOK. THIS BOOK PLACES YOU IN BUDAPEST NEAR THE END OF WWII. IT IS A RIVITING ACCOUNT OF ONE MAN'S STRUGGLE AGAINST ALL ODDS TO SAVE THE JEWS OF BUDAPEST.I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN.THIS BOOK IS A MUST READ FOR ANYONE INTERESTED IN HISTORY.
1,Accusations not backed up with documentation,"Dean makes very specific accusations in the very subtitle of this book, yet he provides no documentation to back his assertions. I expect more from a scholar."
1,Provides no data for claim,"Dean makes very specific accusations in the very subtitle of this book, yet he provides no documentation to back his assertions. I expect more from a scholar."
2,Disappointing...,"I eagerly began this book, having read ""Too Good for Her Own Good"", also written by Bepko. While there were many interesting passages about her early life, I quickly became frustrated with the monotonous and too-frequent blow-by-blow descriptions of Bepko's verbal fights with her partner Alice. Too much navel-gazing...and what was the point of all that spousal-sparring overkill? I skipped much of the book, relieved to see it end. I'm glad that Claudia's story resolved happily, with her reunion with the love of her life. I'd have much preferred more stories about her second time 'round with Molly...."
2,TOO MUCH NOICE FOR NOTHING!,ALL THE INTERVIEWS AND PRE-RELEASE NOTES WERE TALKING ABOUT GRAVE DIGGERS BEST ALBUM....HMMMM I DONT THINK SO....EXCALIBUR ALBUM IS A MEDIUM GRAVE DIGGER ALBUM WITH LOW VOCALS AND NOT THAT GREAT KIND OF MUSIC WE WERE USED AT IN TUNES OF WAR AND KNIGHTS OF THE CROSS....DONT DISSAPOINT US AGAIN GRAVE DIGGER
4,"Good info, but redundant","This little book has some pretty good tips, but if you already have Hewitt's Complete Guide to Cacti and Succulents you don't need this book. Virtually all of the information and photographs (as excellent as they are) comes right from the author's more complete book. So if you already have Hewitt's Comlete Guide... don't waste four bucks on 101 Essential Tips. If you want a good cacti/succulent book buy The Complete Guide to Cacti and Succulents not 101 Essential Tips."
1,A Waste,"This book is so cursory and high-level that I got nothing out of it. For example, there's an entry on spider mite damage to cacti. It says to combat this use a predatory mite. It fails to tell me which mites are predatory, where I might find them, how to use them, etc. I don't know the purpose of this book. It's so short, vague, and imprecise that some one new to cacti won't find it useful. And it's so vacuous that some one who knows cacti will read it and say ""Duh."" And it's too little to be a good coffee-table book...."
3,Good background book.,"I took this book on my first trip to India and once there didn't even use it. We didn't go to the tourist-y places so didn't need the book, and the places we went weren't in the book. The history and culture sections were useful in pre-trip preparation. We found clean and inexpensive hotels and restaurants on our own; it wasn't difficult. While in India I did find a book called Culture Shock: India. This is the book I wish I would have found and purchased before my trip and it's the one I've been recommending to everyone (even if they don't ask me!). Go to India without a guidebook!"
3,Good travel book but horrendously biased...,"I would like to say this book has a pretty good overview of tourist attractions, accommadations and travellers tips. It is however at times just rude to India and Hinduism in particular. It always mentions Buddhism first such as ""Buddhist and Hindu temples"" and the like. It also has the nerve to say of Varanasi, ""before it was the most sacred place in the world for Hindu, the Buddha preached his first sermon near here"". Besides this and incorporating the bogus Aryan Invasion Theory in the history section, I would recommend this book to readers but beware of some of its facts"
5,Great introductory text,"You'll need adequate background in calculus and maybe a bit of physics to get anything from the book, but overall it is a very good introductory text for people coming to physical hydrology from another hard science or engineering discipline. Like most other professions, hydrology is very jargon-y, and the book does a decent job of matching words to concepts. The glossary in the back helps with that as well.I was very impressed with with section on floods. This chapter serves as an example of the overall strength of the text. It goes over the various types of hydrographs, gives plenty of definitions, shows illustrations and examples, and also goes over in minor detail, the physics involved in flooding.The book comes with a CD with problem sets as well as the full text. In general the problem sets are helpful."
3,Well-Meaning Family Fare,"The preceding rave reviews of this obscure movie convinced us to buy the video. The movie is well-meaning, inoffensive, and filled with positive messages of hope and courage and ultimate triumph against all odds. Please be advised, however, that it plays like an After-School Special for preteens. Its target audience was clearly a young one, and mature viewers like ourselves will likely find it a trifle tedious. Kudos for having its heart in the right place."
5,Rockabilly at it's BEST!,Local S.D. Rockabilly band with a Stray Cat/Cochran style. These guys are simply amazing. Being a huge rockabilly fan it's rare to come across a band that can play their instruments as well as theese guys do and I can't wait till they do it again!
5,Purrfect for swing dancing...,"I used to swing dance to these guys all the time. I love this retro swing music(& I'm only 14 years old). This music is sort of a mix of rockabilly, swing ,and western swing. F-U-N & veryS-E-X-Y music for dancing and listening."
3,Nick Lore's Pathfinder and What Now are better career-finding tools,"I found What Color is Your Parachute to be a great job-hunting book, but in many respects its use stops there. If you are seeking books that will help you create and design a career you love, you should purchase Nicholas Lore's excellent career design books. ""The Pathfinder"" helps you identify your strengths and what would make you jump out of bed in the morning, excited to go to work (imagine that?!). It's an excellent resource for anyone who's interested in re-designing their work life, complete with useful, personalized exercises and worksheets that really hone readers' thinking. ""Now What?"" is an excellent career design book geared toward college students and those graduating from various university programs, to help them avoid the job bounce that is so common after graduating, and instead find a career they'll love and thrive in."
3,great book for the optimistic and jobless,"This is the most recent edition of the Bolles series on job-hunting. Having recently become one of the 2.3 million people without jobs, I heeded friends' advice and checked into this book. It's very straight forward and breaks job-hunting down in a very helpful manner. Finding the right guide and buying these types of books is always difficult, and I too was skepical. I found an article that describes the main points in each chapter- http://associatedcontent.com/content.cfm?content_type=article&content;_type_id=5899The only problem I have with this book is the focus on religion- for me personally, that has no relevance to the greater topic at hand. But for those who do find repose in religion and are unemployed, this book is perfect for you! This book will help your job-hunting-self-esteem if you follow the exercises and remain optimistic."
4,Maintaining hope in hard times,"The 2009 Edition is obviously written for our current economics times of woe. Thus Bolles suggests different ways to save money such as moving back in with one's folks if invited. I particularly liked the chapter for those of us over 50 described as the fourth movement of life as in symphonies, and why it's even more important to know ourselves so as to make the biggest impact. While Bolles encourages us to approach small businesses, there may be complications if one has complex health problems. And he does not really address the issue of ageism in our society and job market. Or the structural changes which are taking place due to globalism which means certain jobs are not coming back financial services in addition to obvious ones such as automobiles."
2,Too much Religious Nonsense,"It's a good book and helpful, but there is too much religious reference in the beginning and the end about god and your mission in life and all that. Not everyone is religious and not everyone believes in god (or Bolle's version of one) . It really has no place in this book unless the book is subtitled ""A practical manual for Christian job hunters."" I hope the 2009 version is toned down or at least gives some warning to those of us who may find it a bit bias.However it does has some helpful hints about thank you notes and interviews that I found useful."
1,Definitely not for fresh graduates,"One StarLucile, Mechanical EngineerI am a fresh engineering graduate and trying to break into this new world of employment. I did not realize that the job market is so different from what I expected and what it was when I entered school. I got the new edition of the Parachute, and I am lost in it. I have a resume even from before and reading the book I am unable to see how to change it to make it get some traction. All my buddies are giving different advice and I feel like I am spinning my wheels. Too much entropy! I do not recommend this book to fresh graduates. May be better to stick to your counselor and network."
4,Good book but....,"First off, note that this book is primarily for people who are looking for a new employer. While it has some info that could also be applied to people looking to be their own boss, the bulk of the book applies to topics that would not apply to entrepreneurs (how to interview, how to do your resume, how to negotiate salary, etc.). Also, in the section of the book that talks about trying to figure out your purpose (ideal career) in life, it was a little too religious for my taste, making references to God, and quoting passages from the bible. That said, in general this is a handy reference book for anyone looking to make a career change."
5,Excellent Read!,Even though I still have a job. This information is priceless. I can have my children or a friend in need read this book. After reading for about 15 minutes I gained insite to the art of looking for a job.GREAT READ!!
5,The unquestioned career advice authority for over 30 years,I was fortunate to have a chance to meet Mr. Bolles in person in 2008 and I cherish his autograph on my copy ofWhat Color Is Your Parachute? 2009: A Practical Manual for Job-Hunters and Career-Changers
1,Horrible customer service!!,"I ordered this book and before I purchased it, was given an approximate delivery date of within 2 weeks, which was okay. After the 2 weeks went by with no book, I checked the status and it said 2-4 weeks. I wouldn't have ordered it if I'd known it would take up to 4 weeks to deliver. I contacted the vendor twice with emails and never got a response. Whoever this vendor is, they have HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! I cancelled the order and am still waiting for my account to be credited. It is March 13th and I ordered the book on February 7th, so this will give you an idea of how long this has been going on."
1,Cover Art Turn Off,"This is more of a note to the publisher. I have heard about this book for years and decided to check it out here. Maybe it should be titled What Color is Your Parachute, Over-the-Hill Gray Haired White Guy?That was a really poor choice. Your book may have great content, but that was too much of a turn off. I can't believe you would limit your target audience with a choice like that."
2,Not sure how this becomes popular,"First off I will admit, I have not actually gone through this book when I bought it a few years ago. I find it hard to want to read a book from someone who can't even take the time to edit and fix basic grammar and even include a section dismissing the critics of his style. I think the first step to credibility should be to meet or exceed the education level of the audience you are writing to. In this case, college graduates and professionals. If I give up on the book within the first couple pages because you can't do that, then you didn't do your job.I don't know how this book continues to be popular. I personally think it gets recommended a lot but very few people actually read it because of this concern. But then again it might actually have useful information in it. I'm just going stick with authors that care enough to edit their work. If you don't care enough to write well, I'm not going care to read it."
5,Must have book for every job seeker; insightful.,"Ok. This is the best of the best. Worth full price. I don't care so much for the exercises and things like that. But the book can be summed up as a three in one.It covers:Job seeking (main aspect)InterviewingSalary NegotiationAs well as identifying your true passion and learn more about the type of jobs you would really like to do. People that succeed generally like what they do so this book is a great resource that will help you identify what you love to do. When work is enjoyable, you tend to do better, get promoted etc.I am a college grad and this book is worthy of being used in a college environment to teach a class that would cost far more than the price of this book.No matter what field of work you do, get this book if you are looking for a job. I guarantee you will learn about yourself and identify some of your inner goals and desires."
5,GREAT FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS,"This book gave me all kinds of tips that no professors were able to. It also provided me with insight on emotional aspects that can affect both the interviewer and interviewee during an interview. I cannot express how much I believe this book has to offer. It's definitely not on one of those books you buy and then think, 'Okay, so didn't I already know all of that?'"
4,Watch (with no preconceptions),"Don't try to learn about this film; just watch it. (As I age, I strongly [and correctly?] feel critics and connoiseurs try to manipulate opinions their way. As I age, I trust my own self more.)Watch and think and feel your own way through this. To me, the story doesn't matter; the scenes do. To me, this movie gives visual meaning to the following words: cruelty, beauty, cruelty, passion, cruelty, pride, cruelty, love, cruelty. . ."
1,Gray story of gray subsistance,"A life-long story of a girl growing up into a joy-seeking ungrateful teen trading her favours for misunderstandable purposes, and her donkey, clever enough to perform circus math tricks but not smart enough to refrain from returning to being brutally exploited by peasants and over-boarder-goods-smugglers.Completely stupid movie with the good animal's performing."
3,Au Hasard Balthazar (1966) - Robert Bresson,"Au Hasard Balthazar is a somber tale characterizing the cruelty of the human race from a donkey's viewpoint. It's an interesting premise that ultimately doesn't work with Bresson's minimalist style. The film is somewhat effective, especially the scenes showing the donkey's love and mistreatment by humans. However, because Bresson's direction doesn't allow for ""acting"" in the typical sense, the only character that comes accross as real is the donkey. The non-professional actors are nicely cast, but they are never allowed to express themselves clearly, and the film becomes an examination of boredom and sadness. Bresson's attempt at bringing religous undertones and symbolism to a donkey's life is a truly original idea, but his directing style causes this intersting tale to become an act of tediousness that never allows the viewer to feel for the donkey, or the human race who persecutes it."
2,I think I understand the Germans a little better now .....,"""... flawed characters...."", ""noble suffering..."", Christ metaphors, critiques on capitalism and religious faith pahhhh. If these were your neighbors you would think they needed a good conquering also. Sometimes pain can be cathartic. This movie is just painful. Some movies have multiple layers or levels of meaning. You can read most anything you are inclined into this movie (parallels to modern day politics!), just don't expect anything consistent or cohesive (see earlier) other than those absurd French folk. This movie gets closest to its own truth when shoveling out the stables ( wow, that clinches it, Bresson/Nostradamus predictive metaphors of 21st century American politics!!). Bresson should have been English, then maybe the French would have known how to react to this film. Technical quality is very good.P.S. If you think I am insulting France in general rather than its depiction in this film, you are missing the point."
5,An excellent design guide,"I believe everyone has a heart - whether in social or business settings - and that most people warms up to sensible ""human touches"" in a mechanistic environment created with computer-based systems.Amy Jo Kim's book is a strategy book written with a little humor and a great understanding of what people crave in a community (note ""community"" and not ""transaction"") - to belong, to interact and to be empowered. She gives many practical tips on how to attract and engage people in cyberspace.At no time did Ms Kim give the impression that this book is supposed to be a step-by-step instructional manual."
1,What a bunch of fluff!,"Read this book only if you want to build a kindler, gentler Web community. The style of the writing of this book was so chummy and ""we are just women who want to share nice things and we don't know much about that technical man-stuff."" Yuk! If there was any real content to this book, I couldn't find it. I am building a business community on my Web-site but this book focues on social communities. Social communities certainly are valid, but I need something professional, not fluffy. Also, it totally ignored the technical tools I need to build the discussion boards and chat rooms."
3,Wake me when you're done,"This is interesting but other than the timespan not that moving. Good for Nick Nixon that he uses a 8X10 view camera. So what? Good for the Brown sisters that, over time, their relationship with each other changes. I hope it contunues to follow a happy and loving course. The book is a real snooze though. Sorry gang, I left this one on the MOMA bookshelf and suggest you do the same."
1,Disappointing re-release of an old novel,"My first clue as to the quality of Julia should have been that it is a re-release of a novel first published in 1975, and that I had never heard of it. The characters, particularly Julia, her husband Magnus and her sister-in-law were all annoying and unlikable. Julia, a mother whose daughter has died tragically, moves out of her husband's house and into a home she buys impulsively. Strange things start happening and Julia thinks the house is haunted. The idea is good, but the book is plodding, boring and very weighted down with tons of conversation and little action. If you're looking for a good haunted house novel, definitely buy a book like Tamara Thorne's ""Haunted"" rather than Julia."
4,A great beginning to a fabulous career,"I found Julia at a garage sale a couple of weeks ago, and was thrilled to read something from the beginning of Mr. Straub's writing career. What wonderful subtle horror!"
2,Too much characterization and not enought action!,Found this book too slow of a read. Just not enough action and too much characterization and description of peoples thoughts and actions. Story line was hard to follow and seemed lacking in direction. I finished the book only because I was hoping for an unusual ending which wasn't there
2,Booring...,"This is his bomb. I kept falling asleep, taken me 3 times longer to finish because of it."
3,Not the greatest books ever!,"I once read the Finnish edition of Peter Straub's Julia.Out of curiosity I read also the one in the original language.I have to say, that there is a ghostly feeling in it. The feeling is very much like 1970ish ""Rosemary's Baby"" -like in a nine years after -feeling.The characters are interesting, but not quite human.The relationship with the ghost, Olivia Rudge and Julia seems to be sexually connected."
4,WELL-WRITTEN GHOST STORY...,"This is a well-written ghost story in which a feeling of dread permeates the pages. American heiress, Julia Lofting, living in England, leaves her domineering and cruel husband, Magnus, after the unexpected death of their young daughter. She then buys an old Georgian house, which she hopes will pave the way fir a new beginning for her. Unfortunately, not only wont her husband leave her alone, but the house seems to have a mind of its own.Before she knows it, Julia is living a haunted existence, and her life continues to unravel. As her house of cards comes tumbling down around her, Julia discovers much about the house and her husband. Unfortunately, none of it is good. As the past intrudes upon the present, the feeling of dread and angst mounts as the story barrels down to the grand finale."
2,Anticlimatic,"I really don't understand the comparisons to ""Rosmary's Baby"", ""Julia"" lacked the wit,intrigue and mystery that RB did and had one of the most anticlimatic endings I've read in a long time. What I found to be true about this book is that the favorable reviews do a better job of describing the intent than the book itself. By the end you are left wondering WHY the ghost was so evil when it was alive. What was it about it's personality that made it want to continue to live to haunt others. Well when you find out these answers , you are left disappointed especially after the build up of the first 150 pages. The novel Ringu did a 100% better job of letting you know the horror behind the supernatural being. This novel really left it up to the reader to imagine those circumstances. This is not one of Straubs best."
3,Corrector Yui is ok...,"I was entertained when I read this book, but I think it is a really big take off of Sailor Moon and it's plot is not all that great. But if you need a light read, this is the book for you."
3,The piggies die!,"Holy moly. I was raised on a pig farm, so I bought this book because of the cute piggies on the cover. Unsavory! The maniac on the cover (see image) cooks them in the first chapter! I mean first he plays a game of football with them. You know, runs around the field and spikes them when he scores a TD (as seen on cover...no defenders... whatta doosh). He even goes as far as to punt them when he is unable to convert on 2nd down. That's right... 2ND DOWN!"
5,Excellent and Thought Provoking History,"Top notch military history. Comprehensively covers not only the military actions, but the political decision making that lead to the eventual defeat. Well supplied with maps and photos. A very serious book, not for the casual reader, but a real treat if you are willing to put in the time to enjoy it."
5,Pleasantly Surprised,"My girlfriend and I stumbled on one of Dodd Ferrelle's shows at the Bagott Inn in NYC and were more than pleasantly surprised. Not only does he have a great presence on stage, but he also has a fabulous voice and an obvious knack for writing good music. We bought a couple of his CD's at the show and would recommend them to anyone who likes Americana rock in the David Gray tradition. Check it out, you won't be let down."
2,Ok,This Product came in ok standards was not what I thought and the Chain was so short it would fit around a babys neck
5,Ruth is a Great Singer,"The negative review is absurd. Ruth Cameron is a great singer, and her dedication to the unique approach of the legendary Jeri Southern is astounding. Pick this one up while you can, because someday soon people will be paying big bucks for this great album. Not only that, this album features Alan Broadbent on piano on most of the songs, one of the best accompanists ever, and the great jazz pianist Brad Mehldau on others. Ralph Moore on Tenor Sax....this is tremendous."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"More stuff about that whacky Tom guy and his background, will not be ofinterest to the casual reader. You get some detail on his history inthis story, and how he came to meet his woman, and why he came to livewhere he did, and why he has the abilities he does.It will all seem pretty stiff to a lot of people."
2,Don't settle for less!,"It seems that we lesbians, because we have so few movies that represent our lifestyle, really lower our standards when watching lesbian films. I saw this movie at a film festival a few years ago and here's what I thought:If the main character is supposed to be a stand-up comedian, she should be funny. If the movie is supposed to be a comedy, the movie itself should be funny. Everyone's timing is lousy, the story is flat and the acting is abominable. We need to begin demanding more from our filmmakers. A few cute girls and steamy scenes do not make a good movie! Don't settle for less!"
2,"""Some Prefer Cake""","A Sensy, delicous comedy that anyone will enjoiy! I loved thie movie but it was to sexual! Bye!"
5,Take Your Time,"Tom Lux's new book, Street of Clocks, allows its reader the luxury of a slow stroll down a familiar and comforting path. Its language is concise and uncomplicated, and its subject matter is clever, if not profound. Lux deals with such issues as fatherhood, citizenship, and personal insight without being overbearing or forceful. In fact, it is a delight to take your time wading through these thoughtful poems, like stepping into a cool fountain on a hot summer's day; be sure not to get lost in the shiny glitter that comes from some of the metallic detail of his poems, for it is sometimes blinding. This collection is many years in the making, but well worth the wait. Be sure to include this hardback in your permanent collection."
1,Stick With Windows XP!,"I bought one of these for my son through Office Max. Bad Video card. Returned it for another...same result. Money refunded, bought one from Best Buy, had it for two months...same problem. Nothing comes up on the monitor. The monitor works, because I swapped it to my PC. Took it back to Best Buy and they shipped it off to HP/Compaq. Still waiting. What a POS!"
3,Not bad for price,"So far this computer has worked great, my only complaint is that Windows Vista takes up almost all of your hard drive."
2,Not recommended for any significant analysis...,"I downloaded this unit plan in order to teach to my senior-English class. Although the description indicates thare are 116 pages, at least 20 of those pages are blank. The lessons are mostly reading comprehension as are the tests. The plans provide for little analysis and synthesis, while mostly asking students to simply ""recall."" This may be applicable for my freshman classes, but highly inadequate for addressing any of blooms higher learning levels..."
5,The essential tome of the modernist musical dialectic.,"For anyone even remotely interested in the world of contemporary music and the volcanic changes that Pierre Boulez spearheaded in that conservative world from the 50's to the present, this is the essential book--a manifesto outlining the hopes, ideals, problems and successes that we face in the modern musical world. Every subject is covered here; from extensive essays and polemics to recording sleeve notes to interviews and tributes to musical colleagues and friends, Boulez leaves no subject untouched. What may seem at first dry and forbidding turns out to be, upon powerful and deep immersion, an inspiring and even moving text and 'calling' for the modern musician."
1,Won't stay stuck!,"I am training for a 50-mile walk, and so I need blister protection that sticks above and beyond the rest. This was NOT the product. I might have rated it higher knowing that I am expecting more from a bandage in my case, but when I put them on the backs of my heals and walked around for a few minutes collecting socks and sneakers and getting ready to get those on, these still fell off in that time. I can't guarantee they won't work in a position that moves and scrunches less, but I would not recommend them as protection for the backs of your heels. They were extremely disappointing."
2,Not impressed,"Although having the top edged pretaped seems like a good idea, it doesn't really work. All of mine are coming down after only a week. Not really worth it if you have to keep messing with it after you've installed it."
2,"Seems like a good idea, but don't trust the pre-taped rolls.","I've used window shrink wrap products many times before, and when I saw the pre-taped roll, I thought it might save me some time. It doesn't.1) The tape on top doesn't stick as well as it should, and the double-sided tape for the rest of the window doesn't stick well either.2) The roll itself bunches in on itself, meaning that you have to cut the film much wider than you'd think to prevent creating little zig-zag cut-outs in the space you want to cover.3) The film doesn't seem to shrink as wrinkle-free as other products I've used.4) This one is a little but my fault, but I trusted the height a little too much. The pre-taped top is actually part of the height, which meant that the bottom came out too short on the first window I did. Re-doing the whole thing made me a bit grumpy.I wouldn't buy anything that comes in a roll again. I'll stick to the premeasured films that come in folded rectangles and do the taping myself."
1,Don't waste your money.,I bought the Duck kit and would never buy it again. It was difficult to work with and the tape did not hold. Spend a few dollars more and get the kit by 3M.
2,"OK, But..","I really liked the product when I was able to use it. After 6 weeks of using it, the top portion, the magnetic hook broke at the rubber part."
1,Avoid Peter Serkin,"Peter delivers a bland performance that has little to offer compared to the Bach pros, such as Glenn Gould and Andras Schiff."
5,Jesus Loves Me Fast Asleep,This CD is wonderful. My daughter keeps it in the car and plays it whenever her baby starts getting cranky and needs to go to sleep. I highly recommend it for calming little ones.
5,Jesus Loves Me Heartbeat CD,"Having previously purchased a ""Mommy Heartbeat Bear Sleep Aid"" for my daughter's baby and finding the heartbeat worked fantastic in calming her, I wanted to try this CD also as it also had the real mother's heartbeat along with Christian songs. I wasn't disappointed. It worked great. Very relaxing for both baby and me. When watching my granddaughter I play it the whole time she is at my house. I find that there is a difference if I forget to turn it on. Especially when I try to put her to sleep. My grandson is even starting to learn the lyrics. This would make a great gift for a new mom and the grandmas too."
5,Soothing! Helpful! Stress Reducing!,"I was given this C.D. by a friend who found out I had a baby with extreme colic. I used to cry along with my baby until I got this. It calmed both of us, and gave me peace during all those late night feedings and rocking in the rocking chair. I have since bought one for all the baby showers I go to, and new moms that are having fussy babies! I love it!"
4,Rome - New Years Eve -,"My girlfriend and I really got into this video while in Rome for the millenium, we must have seen it a dozen times on italian tv. I'm not a techno fan and I'm not into videos too much - this one caught and held my attention -"
5,A terriffic book for engineers!!,This book gives the account of the men behind the machinery of the space program. A recommended read for space enthusiasts and the budding engineer or scientist
5,Still interesting,"First read this history of food and cooking in 1980.Still am intrigued by the collection of historic recipes, although have yet to try them. The history seems sound and the prose quite readable and very enjoyable."
1,Bad pad,We bought this pad as a Christmas gift. It worked for 2 weeks of pretty intense use and now just doesn't work. My cousin's family has the really inexpensive non foam pad and it has worked for years. Either buy the metal arcade type pads or plan on buying the cheaper ones over and over again. My family is very disappointed in the quality of the product.
3,Disappointed in adhesive,Adhesive is actually a thin foam-style which turned my craft project into a more difficult task. I have to struggle with scraping off the foam and then applying a tape adhesive.
3,Does the job,"Bought these to use on our security system on double-hung windows to allow the window to still open without knocking off the magnet. They work, but just barely able to do the job. Need to place the magnet in just the right position and sometimes I used 2. Overall, I'm pleased, but these magnets were not nearly as strong as I anticipated."
3,Eleven out of twelve tracks ain't bad,"Upon realizing that oldies took up close to half of my MP3 collection, I bought this CD to alleviate some of the space they were taking up on my hard drive because all 12 songs are winners.I was disappointed, however, to find out that track 1 (""Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' on"") is not the original version but a re-recorded track from the 1960s. Since there are no sound samples provided by Amazon for this CD, I want other buyers to be aware. The rest of the tracks are the originals, but I don't know why Ricky Nelson's version of ""I'm Walkin'"" is on this CD instead of Fats Domino's.Three stars as is, five stars if ""Shakin'"" would be the original."
5,A gift for my sister,This was a Christmas gift for my sister. She has been wanting to see the movie. Now that she has she really enjoys the movie.
3,The Social Network,"What could have been an excellent movie was spoiled for me by the atrocious audio. If you are listening through the thimble-sized speakers of your television, you may find the audio acceptable, but if you channel it through a decent amp and speakers, you'll have a hard time hearing the dialog which is constantly distorted by the overwhelming ""music"" (and I use that term very loosely). If you have a good surround sound system, and would like a movie that uses 5.1 to good effect, get the movie ""Secretariat"". To appreciate how audio can be used to complement the video portion of a movie, get ""True Grit"", or for that matter, any movie by the Coen Brothers, who have formed a long-term association with that master of movie music, Carter Burwell."
1,"A Great, Boring Time","As a computer scientist, this movie was boring. The whole idea of how Facebook was born is interesting, but nothing special about it. If you would like to waste your time or have nothing better to do, then I suggest you watch it. I wasn't even able to finish the movie because I was bored out of my mind. It's almost pointless and not worth watching. However, I did enjoy when Mark had the students race to see who would make it to Facebook (the drinking shots part). Nonetheless, a waste of time, once again.Plot-wise...it lost me. Yeah, it was a legal battle, friendships were broken and whatnot, but Housewives of Beverly Hills on Bravo are much more entertaining.If you have time on your hands and have nothing to do...or you want to learn where FB came from then watch it! But be warned!:)PS. I unsubscribed from Mark after watching this movie."
1,anti-social network - We don't want zombies on our lawn.....,"Wow - saw this cause of the hype about it. What a waste of time. This could have been done in a 1/2 hour episode for ""how its made"" on the Discovery channel.Boring movie with nothing happening.......ever! If a movie could have ever used a zombie it was this one. Wait a sec - it did have a zombie in it. All of us watching this drivel."
1,Another boring white nerdy man getting rich movie,"Most of the scenes were hardly believable like the programmers going out and having a drink at the bar and being all ""cool"". I have never met programmers as ""cool"". What about the fine asian girl in the movie? I only see those types after the nerd gets millions and see bill gates for an example. This is like a bad science fiction novel mixed with non-fictional characters. Why not create a movie based on Napster that might sound a bit more exciting.....well sort of."
2,Social Network DVD,"The one I have has a screen size half the size of my TV/s. I can't set the size of the screen of the DVD. It doesn't work better on my own computer. I liked the movie itselfwhen I saw it in the theatres. Maybe I should have waited a little more longer for the DVD screen size to be adjustable or regular DVD size. I know that Blu-Ray discs seem to be picking up a little, but that would cost more money to get the Blu-Ray version that can be viewed through a regular DVD player. And it would cost more to get 2 wide screen/film aspect TVs. On another note related, there's way too many commercials with regular TV, so it's not worth it ever to think of getting new widescreen TV/s. I would wait for a regular size screen view of the DVD of ""Social Network."" I'll check with Amazon about returning the copy I have. I had a classmate in H.S. who went to Harvard, and I knew a lady who plays violin in NYC where I lived for 11 years also."
1,"Common, mate!","This work is of Mark Zuckerberg, a Facebook founder.Maybe, it is interesting to those living in this site epitomizing an epoch of en-masse total brainlessness oncoming sustained by merely playing the bottoms of the expensive comps representing a higher social status of their owners.Actually, erecting the statues for passed away only was not so bad rule in societies less savvy technologically.A terribly boring staff even for watching it during a trance-continental flight."
1,"boring, boring","I was so dissapointed in this movie. The subject was interesting enough, and I wanted to see it after hearing all the hype about it. It was so boring! I could have cut the movie in half and then the wit of the writing would have been much more evident.A few scenes were great - the twins in the Harvard President's Office, the sculling race...but the rest was too long and boring."
1,The Social Network (Two-Disc Collector's Edition),"Great movie - lousy disc. I knew I'd want to view this movie more than once. That's why I bought it! It worked great the first time but broke up every time I tried to watch it after that. I tried three other DVD players in addition to the one I played it on the first time and each time the picture and sound broke up, stopped, and ruined the movie. The film itself is excellent, well made, and important. The extras are also very interesting. I just wish I could see the film again - the reason I bought the DVD in the first place."
1,poor quality,I received this video and it was badly used there were parts of the video that were unreadableNot a very satisfying experience
2,not even close to the true story...,"It's an OK movie as long as you go in knowing that its not a factual story. The movie wasn't near as good as i thought it would be, in fact, i was quite let down after finally seeing it and listening to all the hype.I agree with another reviewer.....this movie could have been so much better if they went after more of the ""real story"" rather than making up half of it. Another thing was that the drinking and goofing off was way over-acted, making you think this was nothing more than a bunch of drinking and laughing stunts gone good. Also, the part of Sean Parker, was way over-done as well, portraying him as only an out-of-control partier and womanizer trying to take advantage of Facebook.2 stars....at best."
1,The Social Network,"I fail to see the ""Revolutionary"" and ""Brilliant"" or the ""Best film of our generation"" Mind you I am 29 but how redundant and pointless and dull have we become as a society from American idol to glee to a zillion others having to do with fame or musicals and then of course a movie about the founder(s) of facebook really? I saw it on netflix and I wasn't blown away,Justin timberlake? really? I wonder if there will be a story on myspace,twitter,etcera.my Generation really doesn't know any better sadly."
2,Dont' understand the Golden Globes hype!,After hearing and seeing the Golden Globes huype thought give this film a try. I'm definitely a programming nerd and thought this might be up my alley. Unfortunately found this extremely boring and at times had to wake my brain up to concentrate back on the movie. Definitely don't understand the good reviews!!
2,moral vacuity,"So: This movie is about a morally vacant (oh excuse me, inept) guy who teams up with his only slightly morally intact partner and then screws over the partner in a morally vacuous way while also teaming up with three more morally bankrupt guys who he also manages to screw over, all in the context of a morally shallow milieu with one-dimensional sexual and amoral girls/women in secondary roles. Wow, all as an explanation of a phenomenally vacuous medium! I really got my money's worth. (Two stars for the acting.) Find me on Facebook."
5,Surprisingly Amazing Film,"It isn't fast paced, not really, and sometimes the arrogant nature of the main character was a gamble, but it worked out well in the end somehow.I watched this on a 9 hour plane ride, because I had nothing else to do, but I got much more than I was expected. When I first heard of the movie I though: ""Why? Just why? Why would you make something like this?"" I wasn't at all moved by the critics. It sounded really stupid.Once I started watching, I was plagued by the general arrogant nature of just about every single character in here as friend turned against friend, and the privileged and the not-so battle it out. It isn't a legal court case where we are bored with the details, nor is it really a documentary. The film branches out into something not expected from the way it was publicized.Betrayal and pride are the movies main themes. It was an extremely enjoyable movie. Not a favorite, but still it passed by expectations and then some. Definitely recommend watching."
4,Fast paced and interesting,"This movie is very fast paced and fast moving. Not a lot of action, but lots of talking and transacting. Definitely an interesting film, and shot in an interesting way with changes between past and present. Jesse Eisenberg plays a great Mark Zuckerberg.I wasn't super enthusiastic about Timberlake's performance. I think he brings the same qualities to every character he plays, and is overly arrogant. He overacts his parts. But, it's not super distracting from the film so this shouldn't disaude you. Just my opinion on him as an actor.It's an interesting story. Not sure how factual it is in regards to some parts, but interesting none the less. The film portrays Zuckerberg as arrogant, but each of the main characters has some deep complexities."
1,So slow.,"This movie is awful. I do not understand why anyone would rate this more than 2 stars. The acting is good, but the story is slow and boring. Save your money!!"
2,Nothing special.,"""An American Landmark"", a ""Once in a generation film"", ""Mammoth"", wait a minute, what movie are they talking about? Are they serious?This was just an average film about the origins of Facebook. I failed to see what was so AMAZING about it. The main character is unlikeable from beginning to end. He really did have only one friend who he then betrayed.The film was interesting, but not because it was specifically about Facebook, but because of the way each group defended their position, and I was interested in how it all turned out.Acting was great; however, again, it's just an average film in my opinion."
2,One not two.,"I ordered this product thinking that I would receive a two disc collector's edition of the Social Network, but to my surprise when I opened my package today I noticed that I was only sent disc one out of the two. It was pretty obvious that this was the intention of the seller because the dvd was sent to me in a single disc case. If I had only been notified that I was purchasing a single disc I would not be that upset but I feel like I was in someway cheated."
2,Way Over-Rated,"This movie received a lot of hype, so I actually ended up buying the Blu-ray. While the movie seemed well-scripted and the story telling seemed well done, there really was not much story to tell. Pretty straight-forward plot about an ambitious coder who used a clever marketing strategy to tweak an existing idea to make lots of money. He makes some poor decisions, which costs him a good friend. I could have read about it on Wikipedia.If you want to see a good story on the evolution of technical superpowers, watch the Pirates of the Silicon Valley. I actually learned something from watching that one.Bottom line, Netflix this movie, don't buy it. Unless you buy into the hype, because that's all there is."
3,Average.,"Pretentious, whiny Harvard kids who live in a fantasy world chip in on an unoriginal idea. Drama ensues. The End."
2,Commentary tracks are bleeped,Be advised that the commentary tracks on this DVD are bleeped. Its as if the studio thinks you are a child.
1,Boring,"Oh boy, was this a boring movie. In order to make it not boring, they tried to show a lot of semi-naked women. But, it didn't work. So, if you like boring movies that disrespect women, then this is the movie for you."
2,Disappointing,"The subject is certainly promising: a youngster creates one of the most successful companies of our day.The problem is with the script and casting. The characters are mostly unlikable. The central character is so conceited that he does not condescend to attend classes regularly, and pays no attention when he drops in. The same arrogance characterizes him everywhere. The male Harvard students show similar arrogance, though to a lesser degrees. As for the female students, they seem to be in school just as groupies for the sex parties.The directing/scripting calls attention to itself away from the story through the gratuitous use of flashbacks and the mannerism of having the characters speak very fast.'The subject deserves a better treatment."
1,Glorifying the Worst of Humanity,"First, I'm 23, not some old prude lashing out at Facebook because I do not relate to it.Everybody was telling me to watch this movie. I even had a friend compare me to Mark Zuckerberg and while initially flattered, I never felt more insulted after watching this. He's selfish, greedy, and morally bankrupt. He backstabs and takes pride in his insecurity like all hostile nerds do. He objectifies women, capitalizes on hurting people, and delights in humiliating others. He's a tool and a jack***. What's more disturbing is this movie is glorifying it as people come out of the theater talking about how brilliant instead of disgusting Mark is. But I guess that is the status quo. Nobody cares anymore. Narcissism is cool. It's all about ""self"" and the ""I do what I want!"" attitude.I consider deleting my Facebook at times after seeing this; just can't bring myself to do it as I would lose contact with people abroad. Nobody emails or calls anymore."
3,highly overrated,"i've been a fan of david fincher for years, along with trent reznor and justin timberlakeand although this is a perfectly good film, i think they took the cheap way out by distorting reality to make it seem more compellingthere could have been more creative ways to do so besides mis representing zuckand by no means is this a film worthy of receiving an award for best picture - especially in the same year as inception"
3,Entirely ordinary,"I cannot understand what others have seen in this movie to support its great hype. It's an average story about a massive web business with reasonable acting and not much else. Just because Facebook, the company, is so massive doesn't mean the movie is automatically good, even if people are very interested in the background story of how it got started.Quite how it got nominated for 8 Oscars, I""ll never know (apart from pure hype). No-one in the move stands out for their acting - no-one is bad, they're just doing their bit like any other actor and the storyline just bumbles along till someone is done out of their money unfairly.After all the hype, I found it to be very disappointing."
2,"elusive, socially inept strikes gold","i was excited to see this film based on all the buzzzzzzzzzzzz about it. I have to say I found the whole thing disturbing. Greed, greed and more greed. I was not riveted by the mush of whiny people whining about how they deserve more of the bucks than the other. Iwould even go on to say i do not even want to use facebook anymoreafter seeing this flick"
5,Must See,"This is a very good movie. The acting is good, even with a large number of previously unknowns. Justin Timberlake is also excellent, as usual."
4,Quite good..,"Jesse Eisenberg, definitely the role of his career for sure. He was great, actually so was the rest of the casting. I think this movie was slow in some parts but those parts were also critical to the telling of the story."
4,Facebook origin,"An intriguing look into the beginnings of the social networking site Facebook, well acted and timely, given our current preoccupation with social networking sites."
4,Came on time,"This order came on time, was in good shape, and was just as we ordered. We haven't watched it because it was a gift. Thank you!"
4,socially inept brats get rich,"Good acting. People none of us would friend in reality, the real world. They got rich off a desire to socialize. To hell with real friendship. Lie, cheat and party. Genius, but at what price. Leaves you thinking= great movie. Not very nice people."
2,"Kind of boring, slightly confusing",I think the teaser had all the interesting parts. I almost fell asleep... even while being slightly confused by the jumping back and forth between various hearings (didn't realize there were two hearings until halfway through the movie). The only intersting things for me were seeing how crazy nerds can get about computers and of course watching Justin Timberlake.
2,Dishonest Movie; Just ok as fiction.,"Imagine that you do something large, wonderful (mostly) and you become famous.A well regarded film producer makes a movie allegedly about your actions, uses your name and real names of others, but it's fiction. ""Composite characters"". And it contains just enough true information to LOOK like it's not fiction.Hint: Zuckerberg got involved with his current girlfriend during sophomore year of college. Whatever reasons he may have had for creating Facebook, romantic relationships do not appear to be a strong underling factor.Ignoring the dishonesty, I found the movie to be just ok. The main reason I watched it (on an airplane BTW) was because the film itself had become a major issue, something of a cultural milestone, and seems to be winning awards.So, IMHO, it's just not that great of a movie, and it is misleading as well."
5,Absolutely stunning,"This is one of the most significant movies for me. The DVD is very beautiful and full of interesting material, and it makes me love the movie even more.There's really nothing else I can add."
3,Over rated,"This movie is good but over rated. During almost the whole movie the background music was too loud. It was not ""BACKGROUND"" music .......actually could not hear the monolog at times."
1,Slow and boring,This movie could not keep my interest. I got a good nap while watching it though. The rest of my family had the same reaction. I'm not sure why this movie receives so much praise.
1,A Morally Bankrupt Computer Geek Who Betrays Best Friend,"This is the true story of a morally bankrupt computer geek who betrays his best friend. Who steals an idea from two students at Harvard and does whatever he has to do to achieve success.My brother and I could handle all of the above if it were not for the numerous flashbacks to collegiate filth -- provocative dancing in underwear (or less), drugs, and alcoholic chug-a-lug challenges.Why would anyone want to send their child to Harvard after seeing this type of degradation?Save your money. If you really want to see this film, wait until it appears on TV. Or is edited to allow for ads."
3,Great real life story. Movie could have been much better,The rise of Zuckerberg and Facebook is an incredible story but the movie fell short in trying to capture it.
3,Social Network DVD,"Thought it was blue ray because I searched for it under blue ray, my fault though. Oscar nominated movie"
3,TOO MUCH FOCUS ON THE LAWSUIT DRAMAS,"The overly dramatic telling of how Facebook came to be with most of the generals points of the lawsuits have some truth to them.Jesse Eisenberg does an awesome job going against his typical role and here he plays an antisocial, impatient, selfish jerk. Whether this is how Mark Z. really is, well, that's probably up to debate even though Hollywood is claiming massive research being done before the release of this movie. It's more about trust betrayals and fighting over the pie but maybe that's because the audiences wouldn't have a lot of patience for ongoing tech jargon. Whatever the case it's worth a watch, especially if you have a Facebook profile. CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B to B plus; STORY/PLOTTING: B; TOPIC IMPORTANCE: B plus; FOCUS OF DRAMATICS: B minus;WHEN WATCHED: 02/15/2011; MY GRADE: B minus to B."
5,Amazing,"It has been said over and over, but I must say it again. This is the movie of this generation. It is quite possible the most important and socially relevant film to come out in the past 20 years, and is without a doubt a contemporary classic. I cannot recommend this film enough. I found the screenplay engrossing, the score haunting, the directing first rate, and the acting by the entire cast is nothing short of astonishing. I would choose this at the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Screenplay, Best Director, and even go so far as to say Best Actor for Jesse Eisenberg. His performance as Facebook founder Mark Zuckerburg is challenging enough, but he does it with the grace and sarcastic wit that is needed to portray the arrogant young genius. Eisenberg is always aware that he is the smartest one in the room, and his performance, in my opinion, is the performance of the year (excluding, of course, Natalie Portman in Black Swan)"
1,Just a bunch of made-up garbage.,"But don't take my word for it. Hear it straight from the screenwriter.[..]As far as the subject matter: no real relevance, just a sweaty nerd taking credit for a lot of peoples' hard work."
1,Disappointed,"I just saw this film last night. The attitudes of all of the characters are so negative that it makes it hard to believe. Mark Zuckerberg is portrayed as an incredibly arrogant person and this got on my nerves right from the start. I also didn't like how women were seen as objects of men's desires and nothing more (no brains, no depth and they were even making college women look wreck less).The movie was kind of slow (though speech was fast paced) and boring in addition to the negativity. I was excited to see this film and wondered what all of the hype was about only to be disappointed."
1,Boring. Unsympathetic characters and overrated.,Boring plot. Boring characters. And really lousy acting all adds up to stopping the dragathon after an hour. Not worth wasting more time on it.
1,why made this movie?,"why would anyone want to make this movie? Because Facebook is a success? Why not make a movie about the inception of Yahoo or Google, then? or even that Oracle guy for that matter! Because it'd have been dull. Well, this movie is dull and just blah, blah, blah of intellectual debates and conversations! But then again, I ask myself time and time again, why they continue remaking movies about Elvis, Wyatt Earp, Robin Hoods, when it's possible to show the world other great figures like baseball great jackie robinson! I mean, how many times do we have to see their stories retold with the same stories using different actors? I know the answer to my own question. The reason this facebook movie was made was because ..."
1,"Great movie, DVD packaging sucks","I loved The Social Network, saw it 9 times in the theaters. Just got my 2-Disc Collector's Edition DVD, and the packaging is terrible. The outer photo slicks come right off, and they're not keep-able. So you're left with an awkward, black slipcase that takes time to open. I would greatly prefer the traditional plastic case, which preserves the case artwork and titles and credits. Whoever designed this DVD package is just dumb."
1,Worst David Fincher film,"David Fincher just approach the successful of facebook for do this... sooooooo boring thing even! if you are code programmer like ME! check the David Fincher other movies and you know what im talking about. Sorry David I see this because I like all your movies but this is a waste of time, please return to me my 2 hours of life!just compare:1 Alien 32 Seven3 The Game4 Fight Club5 Panic Room6 Zodiac7 The Curious Case of Benjamin Button8 The Social Network9 The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"
4,Good not great,"This film is very entertaining, exciting to watch, and provides a fascinating story about Facebook, a web site that has changed our way of life over just a few years. However, ""The Social Network"" is just that - a business drama, at face value. It offers little of exactly how Facebook has changed us, or the nature of social networking; the fact that Facebook is at the heart of the story is purely consequential.If you want to be entertained for 2 hours or so, ""The Social Network"" is a good choice; just don't expect anything more than a story."
3,It's an OK story but...,"The story was mildly interesting, but after watching the film for 2 hours I felt as if I just finished reading a one-page magazine article. I was expecting something a little more dynamic. And please someone stop J-Timber from acting, he's just awful.FINAL GRADE: C+"
3,social network,"an easy film to watch, pertinent to the idea of stumbling onto great ideas, following intuition and remaining true to yourself."
2,Who cares,I didn't care for this movie. I kept asking myself why I should care about a bunch of greedy upstarts and their legal squabbles between themselves.
3,I'll never watch Oscars again if this movie will get the best movie award!,I don't understand all the hype that surrounds this movie.....Social Network is definitely a three stars movie. Watch it one time and forget about it.
2,Hype,"Despite what you've been told, this film isn't in the same league as films like 'Out of Africa,' 'The English Patient,' or 'Apocalypse Now.' The first scene sets the stage quite well. It reminds me of trying to watch an episode of 'Gilmore Girls'.....non stop, machine gun paced, witty remarks, snarky shots, and clever banter. But, it's just so robotic, there really isn't any human element at all; it's empty. Jesse Eisenberg does a fine Jesse Eisenberg, which is a shorter version of Michael Sera. Timberlake has some appeal early on, but it quickly fades and you question why he continues to be in the story. I did enjoy the portrayal of the Winklevoss twins and their little buddy; they were a bright spot in the movie. Overall all I don't think this film posseses any depth or substance, in acting or cinematography. It's a flash bang grenade of Gen Y pop culture and superficiality that I didn't find very interesting."
2,"This is a recount of events, no feeling at all.","This is not a good movie. It recounts events leading to the success of Facebook. There is no feeling at all, very little character construction, no photography, nor good music. It did hold my attention simply because of the fame of Facebook. I was surprised how arrogant, sexist and racist are these geeks."
3,It's OK,"It's not a bad movie but it is not a great movie.The biggest problem is Justine Timberlake,the man can't act.Every scene he is in is a joke.The other problem is who do you root for in this movie,there either geeks,arrogant you know what or both."
5,"Superb service, superb movie","Second (extras) disc was faultily omitted. When I told the shipper, he apologized and told me to keep the disc (the actual film) that WAS sent and he refunded my credit card. The movie is excellentThe Social Network (Two-Disc Collector's Edition); I subsequently got the complete 2-disc set from Half.com at the same low price so I'm quite satisfied."
5,The Social Network,Everyone did a great job in this movie. It was really interesting how Facebook got its start. A must see movie for everyone who loves being involved in a social network.
4,Worth watching...for a while anyway,"I agree with the person who complained about sound. The opening scene in the club was too real...meaning there was so much sound interference that I could hardly make out what the characters were saying. Besides that, the first half of the movie was an intriguing portrait of the development of Facebook. But halfway through it got more and more boring, messy, party oriented, and I finally fast forwarded through to the end to see how the movie was completed. The actors were excellent, but it could have been shorter with better sound editing."
2,Why was this movie made?,"I really don't understand. Aside from decent acting, I saw no reason to see this film or why the gaudy reviews stamped on it's dvd cover were even written. The founder of Facebook was smart and wealthy enough to get into Harvard, so he was hardly a hard-luck case, he ripped off a couple of already existing social networks, stole ideas and money from ""friends"" of his and somehow I'm supposed to be impressed that he's the youngest billionaire in history? Sorry, but I wasn't. When something comes along that 14-25 year-olds see as cooler than Facebook, I'm guessing he won't be a billionaire or relevant anymore."
5,movie,wonderful movie everything was as everyone told me it was. I really enjoyed it and watch it several times. It usually is one of my travel movies. I love Jessie Eisenberg great actor.
5,Love this movie,I regularly watch this movie. I typically do so when I am doing an all night coding tear because it just puts me in the mood to be a total winner.
5,The Social Network,"Wow! What a revelation. This movie is a definite ""must see"". As a matter fact, I'm going to watch it again tonight."
4,Good,"Ok I have read a book about the story of facebook before watching this movie, I still enjoyed watching this movie to a great extent.This movie is a collection of a couple of lawsuits made against Mark Zuckerberg. The scenes of the lawsuits take us to flashbacks of the life of Mark where facebook started and its initial establishment steps that led to these lawsuits.The story of Mark Zukerberg is the story of success. Once you are successful and you start having the cake, others will want to share it with you, even take it away from you!Good movie, but I didn't feel it was worthy of being an Oscar Award nominee. I dunno this is just my opinion."
2,"Boring, predictable, but at least it's pretty to look at.","I've seen all the oscar nominations and this is by far the weakest entry.Major kudos to the directing style and cinematography, but that is about it.Acting is standard, if not cheesy and overdone. Characters are WAY too overblown to be believable, story is lame and the ending doesn't have any quality or quantity.No real character development or interesting moments. It just feels like superbad.And that is exactly what it is...Super Bad.Credits for artistic value, but it's attempt to ""connect"" to an audience (that I'm still unsure of) fails miserably. A teen Docu-Drama that should have stuck to the facts.Not a ""landmark"" film in any way."
2,Citizen Inane,"Maybe its just me, but i found this to be only mildly interesting, neither insightful nor emotionally engaging, a well-paced but empty rehash of Citizen Kane. I'm not a big fan of Facebook and don't see it as a revolutionary advance, and so that could be part of why I don't get the hype about it. What's next, a movie about the inventor of Redbox, a love and status starved nerd convinced of his own brilliance, who, after boasting about his SAT scores and being rejected by a cashier at his local Blockbuster, stole the idea from a buddy who loads candy in vending machines..."
1,talkie talkie yap yap crap.,Who cares? a movie about face book and how it came to be....who cares.I mean i'm glad nerdy people pass this as a great movie but come on.....i mean yeah i comunicate by facebook....its great...but a movie based on it.I fell asleep listening to these drug induced dialogue.....snoreville man.This is a great movie to watch if your sick at home from school.....grab some nite quil and get comfy plop this disc on and the cold will leave you cause it will be too much for it to take....rest and you'll be better in no time....and you will forget this lame piece of crap.
2,"Rent, don't buy","I did not like this movie. It is about a bunch of college students who created a social network while in college. The guy who actually created Facebook took the idea from other guys and made it better and made it his own. The other guys sued him. Because Facebook was worth a fortune, he pays 65 million to the guys to shut them up. And of course, you know the rest. Facebook is worth billions. The guy in the movie who created Facebook was a little smart a.. I hope the real man is a much better person. A lot of the movie is filmed in the deposition room (if that is what you call it), their dorm rooms, and partying with some wild girls. You probably will never watch this movie more than once so I suggestg renting it before buying it. I will never understand how this movie was nominated for best picture by the Oscar committee."
1,sound is terrible,"Had 8 people to watch this much looked forward to documentary and the sound was and is unacceptable. Did not enjoy the film because of the sound. suggest you do not get this. Also, the disc was not wrapped when it arrived. pskall"
1,Rich obnoxious snobs battle each other in a very boring too technical movie,"With so much undeserved acclaim, all I saw were rich spoiled obnoxious brats who thought they were better than anyone else battle it out in lawsuits with the entire dialogue in very technical computer language. Frankly my dear, I didn't give a damn!It was way over-praised and very, very boring. I would not recommend this mess to anyone."
1,over rated,"Really? Why do people want to love a movie about a mean kid who hates women? yes he's smart, but he wasn't the first to come up with this idea. yes, the acting was good, but not worth all the hipe. this is much to do about nothing much. boring, over indulgent boys who didn't get enough breast feeding."
1,addendum,"the algorithm for face mash is completely erroneous due to the R(a) - R(b) like terms, there is NO rating, just pick one, left or right to pyrimid to top, and how could this on the window alert the Sys Admin to a potential crash.... as Mark smuggly responds to Admin Hearing for breach...4 hours would be a very long time in '03 to id in a secure small scale LAN..."
2,repelled by the superficiality,"Let's face it, Facebook is not exactly the most dramatic of subject matters. Watching drunk college students typing frantically on keyboards may be your idea of a dramatic narrative - if it is this is for you. Curiously, the film looks and feels just like Zodiac - a crime film about a serial murderer. The scenes are drenched in somber, mysterious shadows as though vampires are afoot. The pasty faced fools who have somehow become the hero ideals of our generation are seen leaping about with Oriental 'hos of one type or another, while ""the adults"" all appear bored out of their mind. Most strange of all is the music, which is often so loud (obviously to make up for the lack of drama) that is actually drowns out the dialogue! A bizarre and totally useless film that tells us nothing about anything. Even the title is a bore. ""Social Networking""? What does that mean? Is that what the film is about? I don't see much socializing in this film."
1,Fictionalized account of Facebook's Origin,"Found the movie disturbing until I discovered that Aaron Sorkin's screenplay adapts Ben Mezrich's 2009 book The Accidental Billionaires. Ben Mezrich is notorious for distorting the truth. While the movie is entertaining it, it can hardly be taken as a credible account of what really occurred."
2,Long and Boring,"The movie was jumping all over the place . It started aburtly ,the plot was going all over the map and it was just generaly boring ."
3,"Good movie, but highly overrated","The movie is good, but it's highly overrated. Probably because social networks and facebook are on the media a lot, but it certainly doesn't deserve all the buzz."
3,Over-rated,"When it was released, the story of Facebook was not of a subject that would compel me to go sit in a theater and watch it for two hours. So I decided to wait for the DVD. I'm glad I did. The hype on the cover box alone puts me off this movie. It is not nearly a ""landmark film."" It will be a shame if it wins best picture over True Grit or some of the other truly excellent films of 2010. The Social Network was a fine movie, interesting, spellbinding in places. But it was also pretentious, over-wrought, and full of itself, much like Facebook's founder. I most definitely do not think it was the best picture of the year."
4,If Ebert liked it!,"The acting was good; the story was interesting. It is important to remember this is ""fiction."" Whatever the ""truth"" is varies among the participants. But if Roger Ebert likes a movie, it must be good!"
5,At least try it...,"The dvd menu is just like any other, but the background changes to different filming locations and it makes you feel like your being transported to different places in the world and your a bystander in the life of Harvard, facebook, etc. It's well thought out and should be appreciated. And, of course, the movie is AMAZING! I honestly do not understand how someone can say this is boring or not good. I REALLY LIKE THIS MOVIE! If you're skeptical to watch it, at least try it out. It's a thrill. Honestly, I think the whole movie they trying to make you feel like a bystander. It's one track, intuitive, and fast-paced even when you know it probably isn't. It's an incredible film. But, why did its soundtrack win over Hans Zimmer's Inception soundtrack. He's my all-time favorite."
4,Wonderful acting!,"After reading all the mixed reviews, I found not much to critisize about this movie at all. The word isnt enjoyable, but I find it really cool that the creator of facebook even aloud it. It was mostly about the college aspect of it, friends, trials and tribulations of all of the above while creating a billion dollar ""idea"" and having to deal with alot of the consequese, and those that want a piece of you / it. I thought it was done very well even though I think I read somewhere that the CEO indicated that it is not entirely accurate he felt that it was a fair representation.L 2/10/11"
5,My Most Favourite Movie Of 2011.,This was the best movie of 2011 for me.Jesse Eisenberg was great.Even though I don't like JT as an actor or singer but he also did a very impressive job as Sean Parker.
3,Way too salty!!!,"Love that these are 100 calories & I can pop a bag in less than 90 seconds. It's delicious, but way too salty.How about putting out a low-salt version, Jolly Time?"
1,Bad batch,"Have been eating this popcorn for years. However, the last batch I received from Amazon was really strange. Most of the 60 bags had no flavoring at all and had to be thrown out. I did contact Jolly Time and, at their request, mailed some defective bags back to them. They did seem concerned, but I never heard anything further from them. I was reluctant to order Jolly Time again and have since tried Quinn's.It's more expensive but worth it."
3,Bland but filling,Not the tastiest popcorn. Not very salty and not buttery at all. But it does pop up nicely and you get a lot of popcorn for 100 calories.
3,Plus Points are incorrectly depicted in the photo of the box,"The image pictured - for which I submitted a correction feedback - is not the same as the product shipped. Most importantly, the picture shows one (1) Weight Watchers points plus. In reality - and as is stated on the boxes shipped, they are 3 WW Points Plus - Big Difference!! 3X more! Probably would have passed on them if I knew they would be 3 pts vs. 1 pt."
1,For completists only,"In a radio interview year ago, Alan Parsons was asked why they didn't tour. He said it's better to be asked why didn't you, than why DID you! This disc shows that he was RIGHT. While it's a good collection of songs, the performance is poor; Much of the interesting music seems to be from a tape and the vocals are not good. The singers who made those memorable (Eric W. and Lenny Z) are absent. I'd really recommend the albums in their original form. Otherwise, please trust me and buy the best-of's or Definitive Collection first."
3,Great selection - poor recording,"I agree with reviewers who critique the recording quality. I mean, c'mon, flawless recording and engineering are trademarks of Alan Parsons aren't they? I was very frustrated by the muddy, blah sound quality.It's an intriguing album - almost a curiosity for a die-hard APP fan.I can't be too critical, because its release as a recording strikes me as something of an afterthought.Only for the die-hard fan who wants a complete collection."
4,nice collection,"A nice collection of live songs, with two distinct vocalistis. Chris Thompson has a grittier rock voice, while my preference is Garu Howard, who sings the melodic, soft ballads. What must be noted is the three bonus tracks. 'When' is a cathy soft verse, rockier riff laden chorus, sung by Chris. 'Your'e the voice' is a great track to do live. 'Take the money and run' is written by Stuart Eliott and unusual, as it has him on lead vocal. He has a good voice and the song is laden with a memorable verse and an anthemic climax building to a rousing chorus. It is clear he is a great songwriter, and this is complex progressive rock at its best. Why this song is not on a studio album and is merely a bonus track on a live album is beyond me. Fantastic song."
5,A must have - Alan Parsons at its very best,"Right from Sirius leading into the haunting Eye in the Sky to the studio recorded You're the Voice...this collection is a masterpiece all the way...A compilation of their all time greats, it reflects the diversity and the amazing instrumental and orchestral capabilities of Alan Parsons...Every single track is on its own and you have to listen to them to believe...."
3,its ok,this diadlio is ausome for quality and price!!! the only thing i dont really like about this is the sticks that come with it and the strig and the diablio its scratches when u drop it so do it on the grass untill u can throw the diablio in the air without droping it for like 20 jumps and the screws tht hole the 2 pices together come lose like evrey 2 min if u use it alot
5,This is such a meaningful song of Jewel's,"To my best friend Deep, And only He knows why...Love, only He knows wh"
4,"Seems a decent brush, fairly soft","This seems to be a good brush for lens cleaning, and perhaps CCD cleaning for cameras and other optical devices. The one I received seems a bit coarser than I'd like for dusting off photographic slides, which is why I purchased it. I'll use it for things other than slides."
3,Not as magical as it's marketed to be,"This CD may work great for some families/children, but not everyone. My 3-month-old has had difficulty falling asleep since day one. I purchased this hoping it would magically solve our problem. After 2 months, the CD still hasn't induced sleep as it claims to. Nor has it ever stopped her crying. I now use it as part of the bedtime routine to set a calm, soothing mood. As far as I can tell, my daughter seems indifferent to it, but it gives me something to sing to her while getting her ready for bed. For those with difficult babies who respond to white noise, I would recommend ""The Happiest Baby on the Block"" CD. It calms my fussy girl often within seconds. She falls asleep shortly thereafter."
2,Unintelligible,This book was completely unintelligible to me. I have read all the other enneagram books which were mostly quite interesting. This one was an enigma wrapped in lunacy. I did enjoy some of the weird sentences but I couldnt put it all together or figure out what I was supposed to take from it. I have kept all my enneagram books except for this one. I sold it.Even Gurdjieff in Beelzebubs Tales is clear as sunlight compared to this.
1,Worst Text Book EVER!,"I'm a student at Georgia Tech, and for some reason the professors there think that they know how to write textbooks. I've seen a lot of bad textbooks, but this one takes the cake. I can easily label this the worst textbook I've ever used. The book is full of errors, and the homework problems are poorly designed as most of the times you have to consult third party sources to solve them (my entire class agrees). Gary May, if you're reading this (and I hope you are), I want to thank you for writing the most disgusting textbook I've ever read. You clearly know what you are talking about, but you clearly don't know how to talk about it or how to teach it. I honestly don't understand how you expect students to learn from this garbage. I understand most people looking to buy this don't have an option as it is class material, but if you do have any option in this purchase I highly recommend you look elsewhere. I'd give this 0 stars if I could."
1,Very poor writing style,"Extremely poor teaching tool. Not only are the majority of methods outdated (albeit that is not the authors fault), but the ones that are still being used today are poorly written. The 300 pages of material should have been 600. Gary May should not be writing books; his style is confusing and indirect. I am also very disappointed that Sze's name is on the book. A waste of money."
3,Royal Rumble 2010,The best match on the card was the World's title match between The Undertaker & Rey Mysterio mainly because of their performances.The worst match was the U.S title match between The Miz & MVP mainly because it was rushed and poorly booked.The Royal Rumble match was too short and the quality was so-so at best.The highlight of Rumble bout was Egde's victory.The rest were ok.I give this event a 7 out of 10.
3,Royal Rumble 2010,ECW Christian Vs EZEKIEL JACKSON.Sheamus vs Randy OrtonMickie James Vs Michelle McCoolMiz VS MVPRey Mysterio vs UndertakerROYAL RUMBLE
3,John cena front and center,"john cena is front and center on the cover big surprise, wwe you do realise there are other deserving talent who deserve the spotlight.quit giving john cena everything wwe, its not fair at all."
4,A keyboard savant!,"Having the mastery of exceptional keyboard speed is fine in and of itself. Eldar has this in spades. But without a sense of lyricism and rhythm creativity, this talent anomaly can wear thin quickly. Eldar's talent will not wear thin anytime in the next several decades. What a fresh star I look forward to enjoying for a long time. As good as the percussion work is by Ali Jackson, there are a couple of selections where it is a bit heavy-handed and consequently a bit distracting from Eldar's amazing presentation. Small criticism however. This CD is a joy!"
2,Obvious Technical Ability Marred By Superficial Content,"There is certainly no disputing this young man's virtuosity. Sadly, this recording is more or less the same song rehashed over and over. It's a bit remarkable that someone with this amount of talent brings so little to the table regarding compositional depth. It's really just too much ""happy face"", and almost Teschian in nature. This kid should take a page from the likes of Gonzalo Rubalcaba, Brad Mehldau or even Hiromi. Hopefully he'll grow into a relevant artistic place commensurate with all that talent..."
4,Good SF Mystery/Thriller,"I picked this up on a whim and was surprised at how well it blends a near future setting with the police procedural mystery style. A good novel for fans of both genres.Rauch plays fair with the science and the mystery. Since the reader is privy to information from three different investigators, he or she may well solve plot points ahead of the heroes, but not so far ahead as make the story slow or unsatisfying.Certainly worth a read in these dog-days of summer."
2,I really wanted to like this book.,"This was my first Rusch novel. I was all set to like it, based on the good comments I have heard about her work. The ideas certainly are good, but the writing, pacing and characterization are only competent, at best. Promising story lines start out and then fade away without a second look (the first lawyer, the law firm and the two brothers). Events in the second half read as though she were writing directly from an outline in order to meet a deadline. While I respect anyone who has been able to create a successful writing career, as a reader I had one question after finishing - ""what does this book add to my reading experience, or science fiction as a whole?"" My answer, I'm sorry to say, is ""not much."""
3,A pretty good SF-mystery-thriller. 3.4 stars,"""The Extremes"" was gripping enough to read in one sitting. Characters are (mostly) well-drawn, but the backstory is odd, there are annoying logic-lapses, and Rusch keeps throwing in weird little over-the-top melodrama bits to break your mood. Worthwhile overall, but needed another edit.Google for these full reviews, both more positive:Rusch's cast is all good, with a stand-out villain -- think of an intelligent and chillingly persuasive cross between a mad scientist and Ayn Rand. It's a particularly impressive portrayal, given that the villain doesn't step on stage until almost the last chapter, so her portrait is entirely drawn second hand through other characters. -- Donna McMahon, SF SiteRusch delivers a very readable and thought-provoking novel that satisfies the reader in just about every possible way. Buy and enjoy."" -- Tom Easton, AnalogHappy reading--Pete Tillman"
4,Solid Continuation of the Series,"I'm new to the Retrieval Artist series, but I really enjoyed this novel. As someone who loves (and has read dozens of) detective novels, and who would also like to read more SF, this series is perfect for me. This book is a stellar example of the series. The plot starts off seemingly simple. But as the threads begin to tangle and the twists reveal themselves, by book's end you are not at all where you thought you'd end up.The SF elements color the environment and make for that ""sense of wonder"" I like (and miss) from the genre. But these details never bog down the story.Great read."
5,Best toilet cleaning tool for soft water homes,"If you have hard water stains and caked on buildup in your toilet bowl, then this is the wrong tool...buy something with hard bristles that will scratch off the buildup. But if you have softened water and just need something to disinfect and swish away the discoloration, this is perfect. No mess or splattering, no scratches or metal marks in your toilet bowl. Quick and easy, takes almost no space to store, stands by itself on the plastic shroud."
5,This the one,"Why doesnt the market get it? This is the tool for cleaning toilets, like the professionals. Used with the proper cleaner, it's thorough and polishes, unlike those hard scrubbing brushes you see in all the stores. ""Swab"" is the word to remember when shopping for this item."
4,"Finally, NO Hard Brushes!!!","A good, SOFT, swab-like cleaner!!! Works well under rims, rinses out well, and seems to stay odor free. Takes longer to dry, but so far, so good! I thought it was a bit pricey....but find it to be worth the ""investment"", so far."
4,OK,"I got this as a replacement to my bullet egg that had been with me for a number of years. I do love the patterns and being able to control the strength, but I have not been impressed with the size of the bullet itself. Being used to a larger egg, this one doesn't compare. I'll be looking for an egg to plug into this remote to better suit my style. All in all, still a very good product."
2,"Great work, wrong translation...","I agree with the reviewer below -- Njal's Saga is an amazing piece of work, but Cook's translation is garbage. Track down the Magnusson edition."
4,Great little gadget,"I bought this for sideline use at a football game (replacing hardware on helmets during the game, etc) so not your average use. However, it works really well and even includes a little light on the front, which has been nice for Friday night games! A good value in my opinion."
2,"Great idea, soured by mass production.","2 years ago, I bough 2 of this little screwdrivers, only because they match the colors and name of my motorcycle. They turn up to be very useful, and practical, and I used them for everything, and they always worked. With time one got stolen and I lost the last one, so I decided to replace them. I bought one and arrived dead from factory, I ordered a replacement, sent the defective back, and the one they sent as a replacement, not only holds charge for a very short period, it doesn't have half the power my original drills use to have. Prototype was excellent, but this mass production ruined it for me."
2,poor battery life,"Hi, got excited about these new Lithium Ion screwdrivers, but frankly the battery life makes the Kawasaki version of this machine rather worthless as it gives out after a few minutes of use. Don't recommend it."
2,Not worthy of the Berlitz name,"I love most Berlitz courses. This one, however, really stinks. The book is fine, but the cassette is geared toward the first time traveler. There are NO business terms discussed. NONE. It is fine if you want a hotel room or if you want to order dinner, but your [lost] if you want to learn how to say graph, PC, marketing, production, ect... There are other tapes out there that handle this topic MUCH better."
4,Good WWE Video,"I purchased this gift for my 11 year old son who likes WWE. He watches it in our van all the time. If you and/or yuo child is a Shawn Michaels fan, they will love this DVD collection!"
3,OK DVD; Could have been much better!,"As someone who has nearly everything HBK has done in his career, I purchased this release for a few things I didn't already own- the Randy Orton, Bret Hart , and British Bulldog matches. Overall, the match listing is sorely lacking as far as including the best of HBK or rare content. Also, if you have read Michaels' book, then about 90 percent of the interview content was already covered there,in much greater detail, by The Showstopper. If you don't have a vast collection and find Michael Cole tolerable(I don't), then it's an ok video."
2,Silly,"Unless you're on top of the history of the WWF/E and Shawn Michaels most of what Michaels says sounds incoherent, and thus it doesn't make sense. He speaks in innuendo, secret code and generalities. Some of the matches are decent enough, mostly RAW repeats. The best one being his match with Mankind. This DVD could have, should have, been produced to a much higher quality. I also want to complain about the never ending promotional trailers...way, way too long. Yes, I feel kind of jipped."
4,ok yeah why not,yeah i think shawn desurves another dvd cause look at all the hulk hogan dvds and the stone cold dvds and undertaker. yes christain desurves a dvd but what about randy orton dvd i know not many people like him but cena gets one batista gets one but wheres ortons dvd. oh by the way look for orton to beat sheamus at the royal rumble for the title. if that happens it sets up ted to win the rumble same storyline as batista and triple h. final word if hogan can have his three or four dang dvds then shawn desurves another one cause he is just as good as hogan. shawns was and still is one of the best entertainers in the ring period.
2,Really?,"Ok, I have all the respect in the world for Shawn Michaels, but do we really need another DVD on his career? Where is Christian's DVD? That is one I would love to see! Sure he hasn't been in the business as long as Shawn, but if Morrison and Hardy get their own DVDs, I think Christian is LOOOONG overdue. Not to mention Lita for that matter. I think lately these WWE DVDs have really dropped the ball. I loved some of the earlier ones with a documentary on the stars career as well as the matches. BIG disappointment that neither the Edge or Randy Savage DVDs included documentaries on their careers."
5,"Excellent overview, good insights on wrestling","I enjoyed the DVD series on Shawn Michaels and recommend it to anyone interested in his career or the wrestling business. Note how talented he was even in the early matches. I interviewed him in 1985 at the Heart of Texas Coliseum in Waco, Texas before a show with Texas All Star Wrestling. Even then he stood out as a rising star. Soon after this, he joined with Marty Janetti and became the Midnight Rockers in the AWA. Even the announcers were struck by their skill and high flying maneuvers. Also very interesting to wrestling fans is the way he answers the questions of Michael Cole. Listen carefully to how he doesn't say so and so was an enemy and I wanted to destroy him in our match together, but ""he was someone I trusted, and we worked well together to put on an excellent, entertaining match."" Pretty honest stuff. Enjoy this DVD set and remember fondly the career of the Showstopper."
5,A book for the 'New America',"While in The States last summer, I visited a bookstore and came across the 'Pearls of the Stone Man'. I read the first page and couldn't put it down. Edward Mooney's moving novel reveals the power of love in family life.Joseph and Anne, in their seventies, don't have the passion of young lovers but share the deeper love and intimacy that comes from sharing their lives for half a century. 'The Pearls of the Stone Man' is a heavenly guide to understanding the basics for a better, richer life.Family bonds are as strong and meaningful as love is. Stones will turn into pearls if one can find the truth of life. I look forward to a translation of 'The Pearls of the Stone Man' for the German market. I'm sure it will be a big hit here.Mooney is a masterful storyteller, and I eagerly await his next book 'The Journey of the Stone Man'."
5,The Pearls of the Stone Man,"The Pearls of the Stone Man by Edward Mooney Jr. is the story of Joseph and Anne and the love they have for one another and their lives together after fifty-three years of marriage. He is determined to build a stone wall that Anne had asked for, and the task becomes more than the building of the wall. This novel moved me to tears (and I don't cry often). It is ne moving tale of love, redemption, commitment and bonding. You have to read this one!"
4,Laughing in the Hills,This book although a little dated is very informative about the backside of racing. The characters are interestings and artfuly described. Anyone who loves horses and racing should read this bookTennessee guy
4,Behind the scenes,"What a great book this is! Barich goes behind the scenes at the racetrack in his real life attempt to become a professional handicapper. On his journey, he interacts with the usual characters from the track and brings their personalities to life- their charms, their flaws, and their love of the game. If you ever think of making a life at the races, you should read this first."
2,Hummm...,"A nice attempt to create a surround sound experience for the listener. There is a reason no one has done a review on this album - because it is not worth listening to. From the opening measures, the tone produced from this cd is bright enough to light a dark room. It has a ""sizzle"" quality that lends itself to abrassive fortissimo and takes away from all the lush sweeping qualities of the Strauss tone poems. There is pretty much one color to this entire CD, and that is bright neon yellow. The Bavarian symphony does a fine job of playing these technically difficult piece, but there is a sporatic rushed quality that should be replaced with a warm energetic quality. Some of the balance is really off too. Soloists can appear far in the distance and there is not much lower depth to the sound. My gift of two stars is overly generous."
1,Don't bother,This is not worth buying. The methods for teaching dance to children are not constructive and are somewhat dangerous. Check it out at your local library first.
4,A Wonderful Introduction To A Great Museum,"This book is essentially a ""handbook"" to the museum's collection. As such, it is similar to handbooks for the Getty Museum and The Art Institute of Chicago. The reproductions are very good in terms of color and clarity and the quality of the paper is also perfectly acceptable. My only quibble with the book is that it seems weighted toward post-WWII artwork. I would have preferred more artwork from the early days of modernism. However, this is a matter of personal taste. Regardless if you have never been to MOMA, this book is well worth looking at and is an excellent value for the price."
4,"Good detail of MRI signal processing, Lacks parallel imaging",Its a good book for basic information on various aspects of MRI signal processing. Its main focus is on MRI imaging. It however lacks information on parallel imaging.
4,Wonderful!,"I originally saw this on BBC America years back and recorded it on VHS. I am excited for it to finally be available in this region on DVD. What a fantastic story and wonderfully acted, by everyone, but especially Joseph McFadden who plays Prentice. You may have to listen really hard to catch some things they say but it is a great story so rewind a few times until you catch it all, it's worth it."
3,Readable but without a real climax or plot twist,"I found this book readable and good enough if there is nothing else around. there seem to be no real climax or plot twists that are unforseen. There are a few points where the author clearly sees it as a plot twist or a surprise, but any reader with a basic ability of forshadowing would know what will happen 50 pages in. Decent enough but still somewhat of a bad rip-off ofBrave New WorldandNineteen Eighty-Fourwith cheesy sex scenes thrown in. What I think is funny in science fiction books around this time is that they thought we would have much more advanced chemistry and biotechnology (most food in this world is made out of petroleum, virtually all the children are near geniuses) but computers are nowhere as advanced and something as complex as the internet was unthinkable."
2,Low capacity cartridges,Based upon other Amazon reviews of similar products I purchased this thinking that this was the most cost effective solution. Unfortunately the capacity of the cartridges is so limited that they don't even last when trying to remove accumulated dust from a single laptop or DVD player. Part of the issue is that the CO2 stream is so gentle as to be ineffective on any particles of more substance than a mole of dust.
5,Not for Rain Bird systems only,Bought this for use w/ an Orbit controller. Less money and is equipped w/ a power on indicator light; just had to cut off the connector and splice the wires together....no biggie. Works great.
5,We love this!,"I bought this for my 9 year old and 4 year old boys for Christmas. THEY LOVE IT! They ask to play this every single night! We keep the tin on the table and in the morning when my 4-year-old sees it he asks - ""Can we play that tonight?"" They just don't seem to get tired of it. And what's even better is that they seem to be calmer and eat better when we play these games. I was a little worried that maybe the games would be too hard for the 4-year-old, and some of them are... but there are plenty he can play. And the others we just help him with. They really have made meal time much more fun for the whole family. I'd highly recommend these!"
4,Good product,This box of cards offers up a nice selection of cute and fun ideas for families to use at dinner time.
3,Kids have fun,"Wasn't sure how to rate this. The overall concept is very simple, and the activities easy enough where the cards are almost silly. The thing is, they are simple, so why did we never think to do them before? It does help spark some dinner time fun, but once we read through the cards, it's not something we look back at. For example, one game is to do a round robin and each family member says a word in a different language. Another is to take something off the table and guess what is missing.The kids do have fun with the games, and with some imagination you can do this one on your own."
3,"Was hoping for more conversation, less distraction","I think what I wanted when I bought this was Table Topics Family. We found ourselves skipping over over half of the cards in here because we were using it at the dinner table (as the title suggested) but I think having kids pass around a sock at dinner is a bad idea and just ramps them up too much to focus on their meal. A lot of the ""games"" are physical and are terrible for a dinner table atmosphere, IMHO, but I see that it's still very popular. Just wanted to put another perspective out there."
3,"Nice Version, But You Must Slow Down, Slatkin","As you can see above, Leonard Slatkin has included a second disc in this package exclusively devoted to explaining Mahler's 10th, and playing a few cuts from the Mazzetti, and other performing versions of the tenth. Mazzetti clearly has a keen understanding of Mahler, and his ideas on orchestrating music. But, once again, Leonard Slatkin's haphazard, perfunctory approach to delivering his interpretations borders on annoying. This man simply cannot stop and smell the flowers during his performances. I would give the ""explanation"" disc five stars, but the implementation of those ideas falls disappointingly short."
5,Excellent Reading As Always,"I find this, as with all of Dr. HaHa Lung's books, very entertaining, enjoyable and satisfying. Alot of useful info with the right amount of history an ""why come"" in it. All I can say to any potential readers is this, read the history, don't skip it. It helps with the understanding of the rest of the book and it reads like a good story. Oh, and Dr HaHa Lung's Assassin and Theater of Hell are also really good. He kicks a$$."
4,Shun Scissors,"Well . . . my wife likes them. They seem to cut chicken well, come apart for a thorough cleaning, and cut herbs and vegetables too. They don't fall apart when in use as the blades have to be fully opened to come apart. My observation is that the fulcrum of these shears is small and therefore I wonder how sturdy it is. So far, the metal seems to be of very high quality and the contact points are finely machined. Still, I think it should be larger to be stronger - so far, so good."
5,Quality Shears,These shears are great for all kinds of things around the house besides just in the kitchen. They have always felt sturdy and you can feel the quality when you're cutting things from herbs to chicken. I would highly recommend these if you want a pair of shears that you want to keep for a very long time.
5,"Heavy duty, durable Shun shears","I love Shun and I love these kitchen shears. The whole thing is very heavy duty and feels of quality and durability. If you open it up all the way, it unhinges very easily for ease of cleaning. When you put it back together, it's solid again. It's very easy to do and does not sacrifice sturdiness. These are all purpose kitchen shears and I can't think of any improvements. The handle is made of some heavy duty plastic that's lines for non-slip. It's very rugged and utilitarian, but I'm not that hot about plastic. Luckily, it looks good and the quality and feel still can't be beat."
1,Nice but NOT Shun,"These are nice shears. Kershaw makes Shun and other brands, and they make a good product. But these are not Shun. I am sending them back. Shun commands a premium price because they are better. Period."
5,No clogs,"These systems were in my house when I bought it in 2007. I have 3 toilets and have never had a clog in any toilet, and that's saying something considering there are 3 adults and one tween in the house. I have also never had to fix any problems with them.Flushmate M-101526-F31 FM III 503 Pressure Assist tank without trip rod for most OEM 2 piece toilets using Flushmate rod not included"
3,Hey...It's A Good Book To Read To Cool Down A Hot Summer Day,"Yep, it's not of the same caliber that we'd expect from Tom Clancey. Maybe the reason is because Tom Clancey didn't write it. It is, though, an entertaining book that doesn't take a lot of thought. Kind of like watching a James Bond movie...lot of thrill and action...not a lot of need for grey matter.This is the perfect book to take to the beach or summer get away. Since it take place in the cold depth of Antartica...it's a wonderful diversion from staring at an overheated thermometer measuring summer temperatures.Characters are minimally developed. Action is abundant. The story is just gripping enough to keep the reader interested.It'll never win a writing award...but then it probably wasn't intended to.A great book for light summer reading."
3,so-so,"Agree with the other reviews......No, it's not WRITTEN by Tom Clancy. Liked the plot, but too many characters that are never really developed, relationships left unexplained and dangling. Rather abrupt ending like the book was rushed to press without enough time to adequately complete it. Gets mired down in pointless explanations of subjects that really have no bearing on the plot/outcome. This is my 1st read of a book from this series, maybe some of the characters/subplots come from earlier books in the series that should really be read first ??"
1,[Bad],What a total disappointment. The descriptive narratives where too long and in some cases totally irrelevant. Awful terminology used to describe the operation of snowmobiles (snow bikes?). Also technical misses that aren't ever found in Clancy books. I would suggest better quality control if his name is going to be on the cover. Save your money.
2,Huh?!,"This is the first book in the series that I have read, and all I can imagine is that 1) the others are better, and 2) this book was tying up loose ends from previous books. What did a professional art forger and ""new"" picassos have to do with the events at the South Pole? I sure don't know. Waste of time and money--buy it and read it if you have too much of both."
1,Disappointing at best,"A great Rx for insomnia. The only reason I finished reading the book was that I was hopeful it would get better - wrong. As a Tom Clancy fan, I find it difficult to believe that he would be involved in such work. Is he only lending his name to sell the book, or did he actively participate in its creation? I would like to think he only loaned his name since this would be the lesser of two evils. This writing reminds of the quality found in the first papers submitted in a creative writing class - high school, not college. Too bad there isn't a ""satisfaction guaranteed or your money back."""
3,Lunachicks - 'Jerk Of All Trades' (Go-Kart Records),"I've always dug all-female bands like Rock Goddess,Girlschool, Babes In Toyland and Precious Metal.Lunachicks definitely keep the tradition going and on ANY given day,they could probably give L7 a good run for their money.Their pro-choice tune ""Fallopian Rhapsody"" just may end up being the best cut they'll ever write.The best on this fifteen track disc are ""Fingerful"",""Dogyard"",the title track and ""Insomnia"".I was fortunate enough to catch these babes live on tour awhile back with The Muffs and I do remember they were a FUN act to check out live."
3,Pretty,"This book offers ideas for selecting flowers and containers that can look beautiful in your home. Starting with basic design principles and ending with notes on flower care and conditioning, most of the book is divided into chapters by colour. With any book of this type the illustrations are the focus, and there are page after page of truly beautiful colour photographs. They make you want to rush out to the florist and spend all the grocery money on tulips or alliums.I spent a delightful half hour going through this book, but I wouldn't buy it - pretty pictures aside, there's just not enough substance to it."
5,"""classic oz rock""","Being from oz myself I can't believe I have only just sat down and listened to this album. Absolutely awesome not only do something for kate capture that classic emotional feel with songs such as 'jerry stand up', monsters, twenty years, they also have the ability to belt out punchy up beat rock tracks say something, three dimensions, overall a great listen hanging to see these guys live."
4,Great Album,"Fo me, this is the definitive SFK album. Chilled, catchy and it flows well throughout. The entire album is strong."
4,History comes alive!,"As five strong, resourceful women tell their stories of life in the 1800's, readers can feel their courage, sense of adventure, struggles, fears, and joyous triumphs. These women are fascinating, very human role models. Readers will not only learn about the history of the Wild West, but also gain insight into people who made an impact on its development. Their voices linger with me even after finishing the book."
3,"Okay, but not great","There are 30 designs. There were a few that were fun, but most were uninteresting, unoriginal, and uninspired--Teacup on a saucer, a snake (that any kindergartner could draw for you), a treble clef, crown, balloon, sun, martini glass, etc. The better patterns (i.e. not as common) were a chinese ""Love"" symbol, big kahuna Hawaiian design, and cute ""embellished"" frames for scrapbookers."
2,"Good Idea, Mediocre Execution","I work in commercial real estate finance and when I bought this book I was hoping for a sort of master class in some of the more advanced real estate financing techniques. Instead what I got was a cursory review of some advanced real estate financing techniques mashed up with half-baked profiles of some industry leaders. Granted, my expectations were unrealistic, but I think most of the people that will be drawn to this book (commercial real estate executives) will be disappointed. The author is not that bad of a writer, he just doesn't have the expertise to fulfill the promise of the title. If you're looking for an in depth examination of commercial real estate lending I would recommend The Complete Guide to Financing Real Estate Developments by Ira W. Nachem."

5,Great advantage,"Wonderful mapping capabilities from the software.The dashboard mount works wonderfully well. We are using it with the weighted mount, no physical attachment to the dashboard."
4,Pretty sensitive and the price is great!,I have purchased this item twice and would use it again in the future. It's MUCH cheaper than buying single tests at the drugstore and they seem to be pretty sensitive. I got a faint positive only a few days after implantation!
2,WHY NO IN REVERIE B-SIDES??,"Sure this cd is a good nestalgic item for your Saves The Day collection, but you would figure that it being called ""Early Recordings and B-sides"", would mean that it would contain all the b-sides available, right? But I recall that there were 3 b-sides off of the In Reverie release which arnt featured on this cd. If anything, I dont think that the 5 acoustic songs off of the Leaving EP, should have been on this cd. They were atleast released on a CD while the only way to hear the In Reverie B-sides is from downloading them.I know its not much to not like the cd over, but I was really dissapointed considering they actually went and released a B-sides cd...makes sense right???"
1,Don't Buy This Blanket,I bought this blanket and now there is blanket lint everywhere. It looks like I am wearing cowboy chaps.
2,Another electric blanket malfunctions,"I have had many electric blankets over the years. Sunbeam was the brand I used most. After a few years the heating quality would diminish or the control would fail to work properly so I decided to try another brand. I purchased this blanket which worked fine for one winter. I plugged it in this week to use again and one side (mine is a queen with dual controls) does not work at all. Trust me it is plugged in properly. So I am pretty disappointed. I am going to try and call the company to see if they will stand by their product. These blankets are not cheap. I think they should have a better ""life expectancy""."
1,Stopped Working In Less Than A Year,I'd never heard of Biddeford before I purchased this blanket. Made the mistake of not sending in the warranty card. Blanket worked ok last winter but now it just shows an error when you turn it on. I learned a hard lesson with this purchase. Never again!
1,Biddeford Electric Blanket,"I bought a Biddeford Electric Blanket in October of 2006. The controllers (queen size - came with 2 controllers) both quit working in December of 2008. When you consider that the electric blanket controllers don't get used for half of the year, this is a terrible product! Their customer service is non-existent. You cannot talk to anyone on the phone or by email. Don't bother buying one. Pay for customer service."
1,"No customer service, if it's broken, you're out of luck.",One of the controllers died on our Biddeford Mattress Pad. Tried emailing and calling customer service several times. They don't respond. Only get voice mail at company. I will never buy another product from them. 5 year warranty doesn't really exist if you can't contact them to get them to honor it.
1,Useless!,"This is very small. When you squeeze it, air doesn't come through the brush. It looks like there aren't any one way valves in this. So you have to squeeze with one finger covering the hole in the middle of the blower to prevent air escaping through it rather than through the brush. (Maybe this is how it was intended to be used but the blower brushes I have used previously had one way valves.) Even when you get the air through the brush, it is a very small amount so quite useless as a blower."
3,So Let the Brits Buy It,I count FIVE USA hits. You'll find the other USA hits on another compilation. Steer clear unless you're a Pitney freak.
2,Not at all like the picture,"Be careful on this one. The design is correct, but the colors are nowhere near as vivid as shown in the picture. Also, the detail of the design is marginal. The rug looks like it is 20-years old and been sitting in the sun.However, for the price, I guess it's fine. The listed retail cannot be correct.I have had nothing but great experiences with Amazon. This is the first purchase I've made that I'm not 100% happy with."
1,talking pig dog toy,"If your pet has EVER torn open any toy, do NOT buy this because it's got several small parts (batteries, broken plastic) that a dog can ingest and cause serious problems"
4,Know your dog -- not for all dogs,"I am here buying a replacement. Our pig toy lasted for two years of play, including gentle tug. But this is because I taught my dog not to disembowel his toys (he still can't resist if there is stuffing sticking out of a hole). As others have noted, inside this stuffed animal is a plastic box containing the sound mechanism, which also includes batteries.Bought another multipet talking toy for my sister's dog, a terrier. The dog went at it with a terrific ""crunch."" Then was interested because it was a crunchy toy, the crunching being the plastic, batteries, etc. (We took them away rapidly.)I agree that someone who makes toys for dogs should include anything that could be dangerous in a casing that is impervious to chewing."
1,cute-but for a quick play,I bought this pig based on reviews and though it was cute. Our dog likes to chew stuffed animals so we only give this to her for short amounts of time while keeping an eye on her.
3,Cute but not good for small dogs,"This looks very cute but it is hard for small dogs to wrap thier mouth around to make the noise, or carry it around. I have two chihuahua's and they want to play with it, but they cant really. It is also hard in the center. The sound is very annoying. It is not a cute oink oink its more like a loud snore."
2,Cute - but should dogs eat batteries?,"I love this line from the product description:""This pig looks and sounds so authentic you and your pet will think it's real.""Uhh...yeah. There's a serious problem with your dog if he thinks this is an actual pig. There's a REALLY SERIOUS problem if YOU think it's real!That being said, it's a cute little pig that has a hard plastic center that oinks. My wiener dog was ""put off"" by the oinking and didn't want to play with it. My friend's Shih Tzu was happy to accept the toy and LOVED playing with it. He is not a very destructive dog with toys, so it held up well...but a rougher/bigger dog would destroy this thing in no time. It stopped oinking after about a year of gentle play.Also, I would worry that a dog that is tough on his toys might open this piggy up and EAT some little electronic component from the sound-making device...or the battery! :-("
3,"Not one of the best Broadway CDs, but not bad at all!","This is not one of the Broadway CDs that you can listen to over and over. You can't fall in love with every song, like you can with some other musicals. Matthew Broderick is amazing, as is Megan Mullally (from TV's Will and Grace). This is the most modern recording of the show as far as I know, and it's great for what it is. Some standout songs are ""Happy To Keep His Dinner Warm"", ""Rosemary"", and ""Brotherhood of Man""."
5,H2$ (the revival) Succeeds!!!,"I am playing Scrubwoman 1 and am in the Chorus of a local production of this play. While the original may have a little more enthusiasm than the revival, the revival makes up for it in the WONDERFUL singing talents and Jazzy orchestracion. The one compliant I have is that they didn't include ""Cinderella, Darling"" in the revival. However, I loved the ""How to Succeed-reprise."" The song's about the office girls getting a How to Succeed"" book that's a secritary's guide in ""how to marry a tycoon and take him for all he's worth"". Altogether, this is a wonderful CD and I suggest it to anyone who loves comedic musicals or just likes satires of the business world!"
5,Excelent,"This recording of the new production (which I saw) is absolutely awesome. I also watched the original film with Robert Morse and I must say that all of the new orchestrations (especially ""Brotherhood of Man"") are better and more jazzy. I personally think that Broderick has taken over the role and triumfed. The show is great-- and the music is even better."
3,Sweet but disappointing,"Despite the lead actress's wonderful performance, given her age, the movie is incoherent and dissatisfying because, as a review in Filmdrunk said, it becomes ""a maudlin exercise in cultural tourism"" and ""this tale of deep south swamp hobos and feral children that eat cat food has all the depth of one of those Levis slam poetry commercials""."
2,Huh?,The best part was the little girl's acting. She is so beautiful and did a wonderful job in the role of Hushpuppy. It was a sad movie of poor people living in a flood zone. I did not care for it.
2,Not what I expected,"After reading much critical acclaim for this movie I had great expectations for it. Alas, I guess I'm too old (74) for this kind of thing. Although the actiing was excellent, the surrealist effects, jumpy camera, and unfathomable plot kept it from being an enjoyable experience."
2,Not my cup of tea,"My friends loved this movie and raved about it, so maybe my expectations were too high, but I found it depressing. Life is full of reminders that people live in unspeakable poverty and squalor--I can watch the news or a documentary if that's what I want to see. When I see a movie, I generally prefer something less heavy."
3,Unique story,"This was a very interesting movie, but very different. Sometimes it was a little confusing. However that little girl did an awesome job!!! I liked her spunky character."
3,Beasts,Well I didn't think it was very impressive. Not much of a plot.Kind of like watching swamp people. The acting was good for what it's worth.
3,Overrated...,"I was very disapointed in this movie. While trying to portray life and events in this less than poor area of New Orleans, I found the movie to be choppy, and just not a great story line."
3,Beasts of the Southern Wild,I enjoyed the little girl immensely. She gets 5 stars. The movie was only ok for me. Some of it I didn't even understand.
3,Good acting,There really is not more to the movie than what is already revealed in the trailer! Good acting on every bodies part!
5,Outstanding movie,"I didn't have any expectations about this film going in, and was pleasantly surprised! It's a great example of magical realism that tracks the story of a young girl growing up on an isolated island across the levee from New Orleans. The characters are deeply drawn and confound expectations. The story will grab you as it is told somewhat from the perspective of the little girl, who experiences the magic and the beauty of a place most of us would find horrible.Best movie I've seen in a long time."
2,I got into the movie and just didn't like it.,"I should have watched the trailer but it looked so cute I thought I'd just bypass it. That was a mistake. This was the second movie I paid for and didn't watch. I doubt I'll be buying/renting any more movies this way. Netflix is more reliable for an affordable monthly fee...if you don't like it, you don't feel bad abandoning a movie."
4,good movie,The little girl was wonderful in this film. The film itself was good but just needed a little bit more in the story to fully satisfy.
4,Interesting movie,"This is a movie to think about after watching. It will stay with you in that it will make you wonder what the aurochs stood for in the movie. For me they represented oppression. The oppression of having to raise your kids a certain way, live a certain way, think a certain way, act a certain way. A daring, different kind of movie that will definitely make you squirm at times."
2,Rates an attaboy,"A story caught in the murky whirlpool that swirls somewhere between fiction and documentary, it never quite escapes the hydraulic."
4,Beast of the southern wild,"Great acting by a very talented young African-American actress. I gave this movie only four stars,because I tire of all these euro-Americans who consider themselves Blackpertss. See Quentin tarentinowho claim to racial hipness is his mother having shacked up with wilt chamberlain or the other Barbie girl who feels she could tell us about the ""help"". I would like us for once to tell our own stories Steve Spielbers did Schilder""s list."
2,Neanderthal like,If you want a birds eye view of the behavior of the cave dwellers then this is your movieAlcohol ravaged disgusting group of savages reminds me of the reality shows of present day TVThe lowest common denominator story reminds us that love is alive even in the pits
4,Beautiful movie,"Very beautiful story... the ""bathtub"" world they live in seems rich in many ways, yet is made from scraps and poverty. Great movie from a poetic stance also. Best watched when in the mood for an emotional tale."
4,Beasts,"I really like the movie. While it was very sad to see that people live in such poverty, I found the spirit of the people quite uplifting. Hushpuppie, the little girl, had so much inner power. It gives me hope that some will find a way out of the circumstance they find themselves in."
5,Wonderfully thought provoking!,"Different and very well done.Not only is it entertaining, but deep.The main characters are phenomenal.This movie takes one to a place we would otherwise never go."
5,Amazing Film!,This film suck with me for days after watching. The acting is superb and you feel like you are watching a documentary. The story is rather heavy and somewhat sad but worth the time and money to witness this masterpiece.
4,I enjoyed it,"I think this movie is a bit overhyped. But it was certainly a good watch. Of course, the little girl was awesome, she deserve an Oscar. )("
4,Fasinating Movie,"The young girls acting was amazing, you didn't feel she was acting at all. The story makes a certain sense, even though to most of us it is of a life we can barely imagine."
5,Wonderful Movie,This movie is a must see!!! I loved it so much I watched it twice. I loved everything about the movie.
3,Really kind of a different movie,"I didn't quite know what to make of this movie. But I did think that it was a wonderful movie that portrayed the life of a people living in an area that is quite harsh, yet through it all they survive. They take care of themselves, and each other. Their independence and courage are to be admired. They know they have nobody but themselves to depend on. The beasts are all too real, and when Hushpuppy confronts them, you know too that she will survive."
5,This movie stays with you.,"This a compelling story about love and survival in the ""bath tub"" area of the Louisiana delta. Hushpuppy and her father give stunning perromances."
2,Not sure about the fuss,The movie as a whole was just not to our liking. I could see why it was recognized for the cinematography but I really thought most of the acting was fairly pedestrian. The little girl was good but not as phenomenal as everyone seems to be saying. We just found it boring.
1,Streaming video was horrible. It kept buffering,Couldnt see the film due to buffering problems. Sent an email complaining and get no reply. Just bad luck I guess.
2,Hmmm?,"Just didn't quite get anywhere. Good concept, not impressed with the execution. Will not recommend this movie to others. Sometimes too much can be left to the imagination."
2,The best part of the movie is the Title page.,"The people in the movie had food to eat, lived in beautiful land and help came when they needed it.Yet the father chose to be drunk with his friends and ignored his daughter until the end of his life. The filth was self-created. The misery self-imposed. Thousands of people in the world are poor yet they are nor drunk neither filthy."
3,A rather disjointed story line with improbable episodes within.,The characters seemed exaggerated and the symbolism oblique. A look into the raw life of the severely disadvantaged living on sea level coastal islands maintained my interest.
2,Kinda lame,"A cute story. But I don't understand the hype. Nor did I fully get the point. I'm sure there is an anti-progress social message there that the pointy-headed critics would like. Parts of it tried to tug at heartstrings. I liked the little girl - but couldn't always understand what she was saying. In the end I just said ""huh"" and wished I had watched something else."
2,"didn""t like",It was not what I thought the movie was and very disappointed. I wish you could credit me for this movie. tk y
3,It's Okay,"Everyone raved about this movie so I give it a 3. The acting was excellent especially when you consider that the leads had never acted before but the story line just was nothing to which I could relate. If you like stories that depict character you might really enjoy it. Unfortunately I'm slightly less sophisticated and prefer a story line to which I can relate. I can relate to something ""meaningful"", humorous, inspirational or action packed. Character studies just for the sake of character studies....especially when they are slightly dark, simply don't interest me."
2,Too abstract.,"A very abstract movie that rehashes a lot of the overused critiques of modern consumer culture. I couldn't decide whether this is a movie about Hurricane Katrina, Global Warming, the Factory Food industry or Throw Away Products. Quvenzhane Wallis is quite good, but her performance was not enough to rescue the story for me."
4,Magical Story,A life story that only a child can imagine. The young actress is astonishing and believable in the role. At times with the accents it was hard to follow but stunning imagery. The sadness of the loss of their way of life is palpable.
2,Disappointing.,"I had heard so much about the child actress in this film that I couldn't wait to see it! Unfortunately, I feel like there was just too much hype and I was disappointed in both the child's skills and the film itself."
4,Engrossing Story,"Thoroughly enjoyed the movie and completely understand why the little girl go such kudos for her acting. Not normally the type of movie I watch, but I wanted to see all the Oscar nominated movies before the awards, so I added this to the list."
3,"A Compelling, Promising, but Ultimately Dissatisfying Film","""Once there was a Hushpuppy, and she lived in the Bathtub [i.e., a secluded area in the Bayous] with her daddy.""Positives: Spectacular performance by Quvenzhané Wallis as ""Hushpuppy,"" as well as everyone else in the cast. Hushpuppy's own narratives about life and its big picture are easily the best things about this film. Despite a limited budget, the cinematography is vivid, engaging, and attention-keeping.Negatives: Although it still somehow works on a limited scale, the plotline is disjointed and virtually nonsensical, and the whole scope of the film is very limited. The mythos concerning Hushpuppy's unique powers, the melting of the icecaps, and rise of the prehistoric aurochs is intriguing but maddeningly underdeveloped. Even as fantasy, much of this film just doesn't make sense.BEASTS of the SOUTHERN WILD is a worthwhile ""experience""; as a basic story, however, a great deal is missing."
4,artful,"I liked the way the movie flowed.It represented ""the' storm (in everyone's life there is a storm) as seen through the eyes of this incredible little girl.What an actress"
5,An outstanding movie,I was so impressed with this movie that I saw it twice when it was first released. Naturally I had to own my own copy.
5,Breathtaking,"""Beasts of the Southern"" wild is a powerful, imaginative, and emotional story. Q. Wallis is great as ""Hushpuppy,"" the score is excellent, and this movie, like New Orleans and Southern Louisianna has soul. Excellent movie!"
5,"Gritty,heartrending, and imaginative","Great story beautifully told. Quvenzhane Wallis finds the heart and soul of Hushpuppy and brings a heroic character alive in the body of a six year-old unnurtured girl. The people of The Bathtub are fiercely independent, yet scarily vulnerable to the harsh conditions which they accept as the price of their freedom. Hushpuppy's ability to conquer fear and loneliness and love her world is a testament to the triumph of the human spirit in adverse conditions. Appalling and beautiful."
4,Very different and interesting,I didn't have any pre-conceived notions going into the film. I'm originally from New Orleans and wanted to see where the movie had been shot. I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of the movie and the cinematography was amazing. Quvenzhané Wallis is phenomenal! The movie is worth watching just to see her performance.
5,Beasts,"Excellent movie. At times it did not seem like a movie at all, but more like reality. Unlikely to win best movie of the year but certainly in the top 10."
4,Fresh and original,Outstanding acting by the child lead. Very original story. takes place off the coast of new Orleans.Compelling. I would recommend this film.
4,Very difficult movie,"It was very hard for me to watch this movie. I really liked the actors, but the Mom in me just wanted to take this little girl out of this environment. The visuals were outstanding, Ms. Wallis was amazing, the story line a little difficult to follow. This is a movie that I will have to watch a few more times before I really ""get it"""
5,Terrific movie,Easy to get the movie from Amazon. It's a terrific movie with great acting and a superb story of survival for all to see.
3,Not my cup of tea,I didn't really like the film. The acting was good - I guess. I read they were locals and not really acting but just behaving the way they normally would. It was depressing. I didn't see value in it.
2,Doesn't live up to expectations,"After seeing the rave reviews and awards this film received, I expected a hidden blockbuster. Instead, I found it to be 90 minutes of disjointed events, segmented and weak story line and overall extremely boring. I would not recommend this film to anyone."
2,You need to be in the right frame of mine to watch this movie,Depressing. Period. Nothing more to say but I need to get to 18 words so here it is now thanks.
2,Pointless,"This movie is filled with a bunch of horrible actors (outside of the little girl and her dad) that seemed to be cast from the parking lot of a Walmart in Alabama that is downstream from a nuclear power plant and it has plot lines that go no where. The ""beasts"" of the title add nothing to the plot. Unless your really into outstanding child acting nothing is redeeming about this movie."
3,Not my cup of 'tea'.,I had a hard time relating to the people in this movie. Pretty dark subject and setting. It's a little scary knowing that a child would be living in this setting.
3,The idea is better than its execution,There are memorable scenes and marvelous acting by Hushpuppy but the movie stalls and wanders around before finding an ending. It does make the effects of global warming tangible and personal.
3,Average,"I realized the movie was about the imagination of a young girl dealing with a very difficult family situation and living environment but the overall plot did not hold together for me, I prefer more structure."
1,"Dark, nightmarish, and bizarre","While I agree that the young girl who stars in this film gives a wonderful performance, I did not like the film. Not sure what the thinking was that mixed these disturbing images into a dark, ugly stew."
2,Beast of Southern Wild,"Movie got great reviews.. But why??? Depicts decrepid life in the bathtub in Louisiana. The little girl, was interesting,, but I wonder.. was it acting or just normal life.. It was okay.. just do not understand the hoop la !!!"
3,Eh ...,"It's not that there's anything WRONG with this movie. But it's a strange, abstract exercise that to me doesn't illustrate much of anything. I really don't get it; I think that some people pretend that they like this film because it conforms to some vision they have of what politically correct abstract art would look like."
1,Disappointing,"I expected a good story and found this movie quite disappointing--It was seriously sad, slow moving, and not very entertaining."
1,Alcoholics endangering minors,"If you have a serious problem with substance abuse, specifically alcohol, and you have no intention of acknowledging it, this movie may be for you. If you have a child that you cannot protect and raise, this movie will leave you feeling better about yourself. The main characters show a combination of poor judgement accompanied by a lack of restraint and a steady diet of alcohol to keep everything imbalanced. I really found this film to be wrongheaded at its core"
2,Disappointing,"Disappointing.....I expected more than a bunch of drunks living in squalor. Where is children's protective services when you need them? Not the ""magical"" movie I had been told it would be. Waste of my money."
1,Bad and sad,Bad sad sorry I spent 4 bucks on this and wasted an hour of my life. Sick how proverty should be considered a story to tell
1,?????,"I may have lost something in translation, but I did not understand this film what so ever. I me it was made like to me that no one knew what the real story line was."
5,Modern American fable,"On the other side of the levees, in an encampment they call the Bathtub, a ferocious young girl, her father, and a few others strive to maintain their homes and their way of life despite the rising ocean and the constant threat of a storm that will wash them all away. The imagination, rawness, and compassion of the storytelling entranced me."
4,Amazing child actor,"Quvenzhane Wallis has such amazing presence, she carries this movie all by herself. It's a sad tale: loss of innocence, loss of a way of life."
5,Stunning,"Truly visionary film-making. An elegy to lost innocence, childhood freedom, and the beauty of the earth itself. Fiercely human and heart-felt. A great example of what filmmaking's potential could be. At turns savage, uplifting, harrowing, and gorgeous, BOTSW keeps you off-balance and fascinated. This is one of my top-ten films of all time, and the girl should win the Oscar for best actress."
4,A film worth watching through the end,"Although the film starts out slowly, the story of a little girl's efforts to make sense of her life of poverty, neglect, hurricane Katrina, and a dying father pulls the viewer in. It is a film which covers a variety of life issues, and which clearly demonstrates through the eyes of the protagonist how we can choose or are forced to deal with life's events, struggles and hardships."
1,Huh? What?,"I guess we just didnt understand all the hype. Performances are good but the overall picturs is not compelling, not at all."
2,Disappointed,Disappointing movie. Acting by father was terrible. Hushpuppy was not endearing to me. It was revealing to me that the movie was filmed in the USA. The setting looked like a poverty stricken third world country. I kept waiting for it to get better - it was a waste of my time.
1,Best picture? REALLY?!,"Oppressive, depressing, confusing, sad, and just plain GOOFY! The little girl was good, though. I'll give them that. Don't watch this one if you're wanting something joyful and uplifting because this is the total OPPOSITE!"
1,Miserable hour and a half,"While the young girl's performance was praiseworthy, the premise, the story, and the execution of this film were atrocious. If you are not into pretentious movies with no entertainment value pick another one."
5,Fantastic Film,"The DVD not only arrived quickly, but the film delivered a power punch performances that spoke volume to the connection between a little girl and her daddy. The storyline is layered with a glimpse into the lives of ""real"" Americans--those who love their land, freedom and way of life without the influence of modern world living which is too often linked to modern world madness."
5,Beasts is the best,"If you did not experience Katrina as I did, this raw movie reveals the tragedy of the event and the determination to survive.the young actress mezmorises"
3,Fanciful Reality Check,Enjoyed the movie for the most part - the relationship between the father and daughter was poignant - the young actress' performance was exceptional.
3,Little girl was a good actress.,It was an OK movie and was an interesting topic. Lots of people probably don't get counted in the census....
5,Magical Movie!,Beautifully told story of how a six year old blends fantasy with reality as a means to interpret her impoverished world. It's easy to love when life is easy. But loving when life is hard is something else. Excellent cinematography. Superb acting by Ms. Wallis.
3,Great acting by the kid but overrated as a movie overall,The directing and cinematography makes this movie harder to watch. The story telling is unnecessarily convoluted. The child actress that is getting all of the attention is good but I think even her performance is somewhat overrated. I hope her career progresses and she gets to do some different types of movies in the future. This is a difficult subject to cover and is completely out of the ordinary but the direction is not worthy of the accolades it is getting.
4,Great film.,One of those films that blew me away. Also one of those films where I wouldn't watch it again for a very long time because I was fulfilled with what I got out of it the first time.
4,"Lyrical, Intimate Apocalyptic Poem to Family","This once in a lifetime film, written and produced by independent artists, boasts a lyrical script, amazing performances by a young girl and an amateur man who play daughter and father with miraculous and moving presence, and a musical score only matched by the film's photography for its magic. It is a tale about love and family and independence told in an imagined bayou landscape with much of the soliloquy grace of a late play by Shakespeare. Relax AND ENJOY IT WITH AN OPEN, QUIET MIND."
3,Movie was okay!,I think this movie was okay. I don't quite understand all the other reviews saying it's OSCAR worthy. It did not blow me away. Thought a little disjointed. So the story was about this little girl in the bathtub. All could be true. BUT the GIANT BEASTS ---that just threw realty out the window. Maybe they could have kept them life like in size. it Flicked around...tried to figure out who was with who --like the other children. Just an okay film.
3,Very Unusual,This movie needed a plot. I know there was one but it ended up just watching it for the Wallis girl. She was great but a lot of the facial expressions of feeling were small child pouts. Most people would become impatient with the story line.
5,Breathtaking,"This movie is simply a film that has turned poetry into a motion picture. I cried and laughed. This movie is a must see for children and adults. It taught me to be grateful for everything I have, especially the things I don't really need."
3,A Total Fantasy,"I was expecting much more. The indigent people of Louisiana's southern-most Parishes deserve more. Their stories of before, during and after Katrina are more colorful, complex and real than this movie portrayed. And, frankly, I've read and seen way better fairy tales! The real tragedy of Beasts Of The Southern Wild is that some will see it as an accurate portrayal; even worse a documentary. It is a fake, a fantasy not so different from Harry Potter or Peter Pan. Having said all of that, Terrebonne Parish IS a wonderful magical place, the acting in the flawed movie was excellent and Quvenzhané Wallis, in particular, should and deserves to go on to have a stellar career."
2,Not Oscar-worthy,Hard to follow and just not what I expected at all. Wish I had spent the time watching one of the other Oscar-nominated movies.
2,Huh!,Quvenzhane Wallis did act superbly in this movie however the movie itself was very obtuse and at times difficult to follow.
3,Finally seen it.,"This was a ok movie. Didn't think she should have been nominated, but her performance was good. I just want to hit submit."
3,Worth the effort,The film is difficult to follow and it helps to know the context of the setting before you see it. Else you will have to hang onto every word. I had difficulty hearing and decoding what some of the characters were saying. Eventually I figured out the narrative. Offbeat but Interesting. Hard to believe people live like that.
2,Amazed at the love for this film,"I went in with high expectations after reading wonderful reviews. I came away disappointed. The film was a depressing look at poverty, mental illness and child neglect. The plot was a chaotic mess. I failed to see any magic save for the wonderful performance by Quvenzhané Wallis who plays Hush puppy. She's a magical little actress with no doubt a great future ahead of her. This film however was still a depressing mess."
4,"Different and weird, but good","I watched this movie based off all the hype about the young actress and how well she played this role. It was one of those movies where you have to pay close attention to get it. A couple people I know didn't like it because it was too weird or too deep.The young actress definitely played her role well, but this is one of those movies where a second viewing may make it more understandable and enjoyable. Although it is not the type of movie I normally watch, I was able to grasp it and gain some level of enjoyment over the movie's overall intent."
3,Interesting,"Glad I watched it , acting was good. Wish the story line was a bit more crisp. Not a fan of fuzzy storytelling."
2,What?,"I must have clicked on the wrong thing - Download.I couldn't get it to play on my Kindle Fire. It would just flash, ""Downloading"" And this went on for at least an hour. What should I have done to get to see the movie?"
2,not my type of film,"There is a ""first person"" feel to this film. We were disappointed....we kept waiting for SOMETHING to happen, but it was just everyday life. I get enough of that with MY life. I should have researched better before I purchased it. We watched about 15 minutes and turned it off."
2,"Boring, Overhyped Nonsense","I wanted to like this movie when I first saw it trailer, but found myself completely bored by it's incoherent ""plot"" and and general nonsense once I made it to the theatre. Rarely do I seriously contemplate walking out of a movie, but I almost did with this one. Honestly, the only thing that kept me from leaving was my silly hope that the film would have a redeeming moment somewhere towards the end. It didn't. Not even close. What else can I say? Save your time, your money and your emotional investment; avoid this mishmash of a film."
2,Slowwww,This film is self-indulgent and neither entertaining or edifying.The two protagonists are wonderful natural actors; the film does not support them.
1,Beastly,"The young girl is very cute, but movie is disjointed and simply not enjoyable. An art critic's movie (perhaps), but not for the ordinary movie-goer"
2,not a very good movie i was very disappointed,"hard to follow, the little girl is really good but movie is hard to follow. It moves around alot and you have to be following it and on guard, lots of left out stuff to leave to your imagination."
5,Very Sweet and Moving,"I hope that more people take the time to watch this movie. I couldn't turn away from the film, and can't stop thinking about it days after I watched it. The young starring actress deserves an Oscar for her performance."
1,Horrible and I get it...don't need to sit through 90 minutes,"I wish I could get back the time spent watching this. Horrible story, although filmed in an artistic and cinematic manner. Still - not worth the time. I get poverty, I get mental illness, alcoholism, etc. - just a weird take on presenting poverty in film. No real meat to the story. Just disappointing."
2,Didn't hold my interest,I was really looking forward to this movie and I appreciate the high acting quality (the little girl is awesome!) but I just didn't hold my interest. I could only get through part of it.
2,I just don't know what this movie is about.,"Tried to watch but turned it off after about 45 minutes because there was no plot and, honestly, quite boring. Just not my type of movie."
5,Beasts Of The Southern Wild,"This masterpiece is the best movie creatively and realistic that I seen in years. What great acting, emotion and human resolve was displayed. Ms. Wallis exhibited genuine skill that is sorely lacking in today's ""starlets"". They all need to study all they actors in this film. This is an absolute Oscar worthy win! While watching this film, I felt like was I on the screen participating in some small way. This is a must see and have film to own."
4,Watched this movie twice in a 24 hour period,A reflection of life's journey is what comes to mind. The director was able to create a silent moment that was more powerful than 20 minutes of action.
4,Interesting Movie,"I thought it was a nice movie. The line between fantasy and reality got a bit blurry, so it was hard to make sense of at times."
4,The New 'True Grit',"Lead girl is genuinely mesmerizing, as is also father, though WAY more painful to witness. In its stark, humane tale of survival the film manages to fold in many layers, while providing a glimpse 'below the levee' of a world few of us have likely seen. Well worth a look!"
3,"Worth a view, but I didn't LOVE it.....","I am glad I watched this movie. It was unique with a very particular point of view. I always give credit when movies, music, etc. color outside the lines. So, a big thumbs up for that. For me, this movie was all about Quvenzhane Wallis. She is just amazing. You can't and don't want to take you eyes off of her. She's a beautiful wild child wise beyond her years. Her dad attempts to prepare her for life without him and instills in her an appreciation for the life they live and the community in which they live it in. I can't say I loved this movie (unlike most of America), but am very glad I saw it. Little Q is well worth the price of admission."
2,Not that Great a Story but Nice Visuals,"This really isn't a very good story. It has wonderful visuals, but the story is disjointed and somewhat flat. Also, the cinematography gets annoying with all the handheld, jerky camera moves.I did love the setting. Great atmosphere!"
3,Not sure why this is getting such top-notch reviews,"Great performance by the young Quvenzhané Wallis but overall this picture is pretty tough to watch, and there aren't a lot of characters to care about. The young girl is living in a horrid situation and dealing with a fairly abusive situation with her father and the locals they hang out with. The only adult character in this movie who had any redeeming qualities was the school teacher. I just didn't find this window into this world to be something I needed to see. It's not that I can't handle watching films about people living in difficult situations, but this film almost seemed to glorify the lives of these outliers when it's really a situation that should not be happening in our society in this day and age."
2,Sort of pointless...,The hype o this movie is totally undeserved. The little girl was very cute but her acting wasn't anything special and the rest of the cast were bums and misfits. There is nothing noble or heartwarming about this story as some have said its kind of pointless.
4,Amazing movie,"I enjoyed the entertainment aspect of this movie - was confused about a few things, but if you just enjoy it and try not to figure it out, this movie is worth watching. The young protagonist is amazing."
2,Silly,"Although the movie may portray some form of realism of life in the bayou, I still find it hard to believe. I found the young girl's thought process too advanced for her age, and the characters themselves boring and lifeless, which I guess is exactly what the director tried to convey. I would not recommend, and I fail to see how this movie could be nominated for an Oscar or how this young actor could be nominated for best actress (sorry for you PC people, but actress still sounds appropriate to me. What's wrong with using words to identify the sexes?)"
2,This movie is tripe,"Fard to follow. Based during and after Katrina, having lived through the storm, I found many issues with the realizm of the film. Story took a lot of discussion to come up some sort of meaning. Acting was fair."
2,Strange,"I once lived in New Orleans and enjoyed seeing some of the area again in this movie, however it was strange to say the least and hard to get into. The main character played by the 6 year old was believable and she was good but overall the movie was just strange."
2,Almost nothing to like.,"Pros:The little girl put on a good performance.The title is apt. The entire movie reminded me of the opening scenes of ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" (The Dawn of Man)Cons:Mediocre to poor photography, camera wobbled all over the place, bad editing.Often-indistinguishable dialog.No character development. One feels sorry for the girl but not because one gets to know her.No real story, per se, just a sliver of a common thread across many confusing, disjointed scenes.Mostly a ""feel bad"" theme (some graphically unpleasant moments).Comment:Perhaps this movie merely intended to portray a few days in the life of the Bayou in all of its primitiveness and ghastliness. I suppose it succeeds. You don't know what they're saying or doing and, presumably, they don't either. Beasts obeying their primordial instinct to survive. Point made but who cares?"
2,Not sure what makes this oscar worthy,"Hearing this was nominated for an oscar, I decided to give this movie a watch. I won't say this movie was bad but I don't get what made this oscar worthy. A muddled story with hit and miss acting, the girl was good but not oscar worthy. Is it worth a rent, maybe but I think this is the type of movie that some people will love and get and others will be scratching their heads."
2,Slightly disappointed,The acting in the movies was great. But it was too abstract for a late night viewing. Also it is not appropriate for kids under the age of 12.
3,Much ado about nothing,"Accept for the curiosity of Hushpuppy adorably played by Quvenzhané Wallis and some stunning photography, the story left me flat ... especially the mean-spirited father and all his outbreaks of anger ... so its okay, but far from Oscar material. 3 stars or less for me is ""I don't have to see it again"" But Quvenzhané Wallis' performance makes it worth others sampling this picture."
2,clark,"Boring, drawn out with no real conclusion. I just didn't like it, I kept expecting something to happen, but it never did."
4,New story,The little girl made this movie. The story wasn't ground breaking but it was enjoyable to watch. I would recommend it.
5,Good...,The product is very good and in new condition. It is also a very good movie. I highly recommend this dvd.
2,Not what I thought,"Acting was good, plot was well put together, and over all an ok movie. I just thought it was going to be more fantasy then real life. Should have read more about the movie. This is a must see, but not one to buy."
2,Very slow movie ..... you might enjoy it if you can stay awake till the end,"I think women will like this movie much more than men... I could hardly stay awake because the movie moved forward sooooo slow. The last few minutes were good, tear moment, but most of the movie put me to sleep."
3,Too sad,I can see how the acting was considered great by the little girl but it was too sad for me. And it was really gross when she cooked the dog food.
3,Amazing Young actress,"Young Ms. Wallis is an amazing actress, and the story portrayed unique. The cinematography good. I just thought the story itself was kind of slow."
4,Solid,"A solid performance, worth the price to watch. A little confusing as to what is actually taking place at times. The acting is excellent by all the cast members."
1,Depressing,"I was never more grateful for my parents. Those poor, poor children, growing up with paranoid drunks who foster an ""us against the world"" mentality. I didn't see anything good in this movie."
2,Boring docudrama,"Having lived in the south for many years, I found this movie boring - a docudrama on life in the bayou. I would suppose that many Americans have no idea of how these people live and survive. So, for those people this movie may be enlightening and shocking. However, I couldn't wait for it to end. Both my son and myself couldn't believe the good rating it had! It was a waste of time and money for me."
3,Strange movie,"Different more a docudrama. Very real, not your typical movie. Shows brutality of poverty. Very very real, not a piece of fluff"
2,Beasts of the Southern Wild,I could not understand the language. I think I would have liked the film otherwise. Can one get the DVDs with subtitles??
3,A bizzare movie with a great little actress!,"This movie is definitely not your typical movie, but was thought provoking and intriguing. The young actress with the lead role is amazing for her age!"
2,"Sorry, I just didn't get it","Whenever there's a lot of buzz around a movie, I like to check it out. Usually, I get what the buzz is all about. Not on this one. Is it a movie? Is it a documentary? What's the story? Blah...just didn't like it. The kid is cute, but is she acting?? Glad I didn't pay money to see it at the movies."
2,"Interesting scenery, and that is it!","Interesting scenery, and that is it!Very disappointing.I am appalled that people live that way--in my opinion it is child abuse."
2,Buzz?,"It was OK, some bad editing and acting made the ""suspension of disbelief"" hard towards the end of the Movie"
5,Honest,Fierce and honest. Unadulterated view of a poor but proud culture of independence. I know these people & love the boldness of the movie.
2,I don't understand the hype...,"Not sure why this movie is getting so much attention. It completely lacks any form or structure. The metaphor is easy to follow, but it needed some framework. It just feels like a movie you were supposed to like."
3,Beasts of the Southern Wild,"I enjoyed this movie ~ probably had heard too much hype, so it couldn't meet my expectations. It was one of those child-with-dystopian-life-but-doesn't-know-it movies. It was relatively predictable, and I'm not sure there were any lessons learned or new revelations. I"
5,Appreciate what you have,"Powerful movie that really makes you appreciate what you have and feel for those swept away in situations such as this. The cost of decisions you make and the will to survive in hard times is difficult, but for a child ... your heart goes out to this brave little soul."
3,Good but Slow Starter,This is a slow starter but outstanding movie. Let the movie start and go make some popcorn get a drink and by the time you get back the pace will have picked up.
5,Interesting Storytelling and very charming young actor,Interesting Storytelling and very charming young actor.Very glad we watched it. Some of the sequences flew overmy head but I'm open to watching again.
5,Beautifully done,"Not for the weak of heart. This film was a moving, lyrical meditation. It reminded me, in many ways, of The Tree of Life. Excellent."
3,Interesting | Not Award Winning,"Perhaps I didn't fully get it, but this movie was interesting ... but not award-worthy. The young actress is certainly special ... but I didn't see or feel an Oscar-worthy performance. Don't believe the hype. But the movie is worth seeing."
5,Wonderful magical realism,"Realized ten minutes into the movie that it was by the same director who did Glory at Sea, which remains one of my all-time favorite short films."
4,Sweet Movie,"Loved this movie, though, glad I watched it at home. Very artistic, not a ton of dialogue...an interesting perspective of a socioeconomic group with which I would never have been familiar without seeing this movie. Highly recommended!"
3,Glad I saw It but....,Not as good as expected. A little too detached and dark for me. Just didn't do it for me. Just didn't click for me.
3,Amazing acting for new actors,"Just didn't care for the fanciful storyline, and my guess will be that many will have the same problem understanding what the actors are saying as their Louisiana back country patois is so thick and they speak too quickly."
4,An extraordinary insight into Bayou culture,"Hard to believe that there might be subcultures like this existing in modern America. Acting is extraordinary, especially the role played by the young girl."
4,Powerful story of human spirit,"""Beasts"" provides an immediate window into primal forces of human nature: Parental/familial love, the will to survive, the power of community, the strength of mind and imagination.Almost like reading a picture book, gripping vignettes lead the viewer through episodes strung together without gloss. In the end the story is heartwrenching and moving. Viewers may think of themselves as outsiders looking in, but will be unable to deny their kinship to these characters who make no pretense of their humanity."
5,Hard to watch but very well done!,"It's about a kind of life most of us can't imagine and don't like to think about. There are people living in extreme poverty, yet they are people too, just like us and we can relate to them, and that's the heartbreaking part."
3,What is this really about?,"I saw people living in hovels on the fringe of the city, drinking alot and fishing. When they are moved into a shelter to receive care and put on clean clothes, they revolted and bolted. I didn't see the kids getting any schooling and I don't know that the father really taught his daughter how to live on her own, and in those conditions (?) Most parents want a better life for their children so I found this a downer."
3,Beasts of a Southern Wild,"It was a okay in my opinion but I didn't love it! It was actually kind of weird for my taste in movies. I will say the acting was very good, especially for 2 unknowns."
3,LAST MAN IN THE BATHTUB,"Emma, known as Hush Puppy (Quvenzhané Wallis) lives in the Bayou in a very impoverished world that lives mostly off the swamp. Her dad (Dwight Henry)is ill. The community struggles against the rising water that seems to engulf the world. The ""beasts"" or aurochs are symbolic of humans on their road to extinction...I think.The soundtrack and music was enjoyable. The artsy metaphor was well done, but didn't bring the film home. For people who like films such as ""Melancholia"" this one is will be right down your alley. I didn't relate to the characters. The first person narration by Hush Puppy wasn't well written, or perhaps too much above my head. It just didn't grab me like it did the Sundance Festival. There is a theme of tough love throughout the film, something that didn't excite me either. Her imagination and search for her mother leads one into speculation as to how much of the film was real or a child's imagination.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity."
2,"Was expecting a good movie, but it was a disappointment......","I was really looking forward to watching this film, and was very disappointed. Though I loved the little girl, and the beautiful cinematography, the story was disjointed and forced, and disappointing. The child actress carried the film, but some of it did not make much sense, etiher literally or symbolically. It has been a long time since I so looked forward to a movie that diappointed me so much. I see some others found it uplifting; to me, it was the total opposite...depressing as well as lacking a meaningful message ( that I could discern.) I would not recommend it."
2,Confused about all the hoopla,"Not worth the time to watch it. No acting involved on the part of Ms. Wallis. Interesting premise, but the promotional hoopla about the production does not reflect the quality of plot, characterization, nor symbolism. Cinematography was quite good."
2,Story & Acting Overrated,After seeing the movie I was surprised that the little girl who played the principal character was nominated for an Academy Award. I suppose if her performance were being compared to other six year olds she'd come out on top. It was a good performance in pedestrian story. Her scenes were short as would be expected in someone so young and much of her contribution was in the narration.
5,Amazing!,"I'm not very good with writing summaries of things I like or dislike but I tell you this, this movie was damn good. Now, I am truly upset that this movie was not nominated for a Golden Globe. The Oscars better not miss out or else I will protest for life. Talk about an original story based on factual events (finally). I loved the powerful message of a loving relationship between father and daughter, and people to people. Everyone in this movie was good. This movie touched my heart in a thousand different ways, oh how I cried. Beautiful!Watch this movie now!!!!"
2,Confused,The film was interesting but I am confused as to why it is receiving such accolades. I have a good attention span but found the film tedious to sit through. Too long and to disjointed.
2,Disappointing,"There seemed to be no plot, yet the movie was seeming to include too many and too varied themes. Overall, I find the movie depressing , not inspiring as I had heard."
3,stars are enough,please change your way of reviewing films. stars should be all that is required Stars should be all that are
1,Worst Movie Award!!!,"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!! No plot, horrible disgusting characters and ugly back ground scenery. I would not recommend this movie to my worst enemy! I really can't think of why this movie was made or who would finance such a stupid monstrosity."
1,Sad,The movie stopped several times during viewing and then actually stopped 1 minute before the end. Grrrr! It took a while working with it to catch the end.The movie itself was great!!
1,LOUSY MOVIE,I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS MOVIE IS UP FOR AWARDS. I COULDN'T IDENTIFY ANY REAL PLOT. IT WASN'T EVEN A GOOD DOCUMENTARY OF AN EVENT OR PERSONS CIRCUMSTANCE.
1,Too wild for me,This was not entertainment of any kind. Not quite sure why it is getting so much attention. We were disappointed and have already told people not to see it.
2,Vegetarians beware.,"If you're a vegetarian, have a weak stomach or both, you're going to have trouble enjoying the movie. The gruesome visuals details were not featured in the trailer. Sometimes the food scenes were just reviling, other times the director seemed to take pleasure in submitting the audience to up-close food-related cruelties that appear to be happening to actual living things. I did not stay to the end of the credits but I am reasonably sure that the array of life forms scooped up out of the murky water for dinner were real. Other than that, prepare for a grim, claustrophic visual domain, a glum plot and unlikeable characters. The kids were good, yes, adorable, but the in-your-face, depravity slice-of-life angle was too far over the top to appreciate."
2,Too much publicity,"There was just so much publicity surrounding this movie because of the Oscars, and I found it to not be worth my time at all.Very disappointed, the Oscars have to do much better, but for an Independent film, I guess it was the best out there."
3,Interesting story,"This area of the country is something that is commonly talked about in the media, but I had no exposure to. It helped me understand the humanness of what folks down there are struggling with. An that child actor did a fantastic job."
3,A hard movie about a little girl's hard life,"Despite the mystical allusions of the title and a few dreamlike sequences, this is primarily the story of a very small girl growing up usder extremely difficult circumstances. As such, it's neither jouous nor enjoyable to watch. The symbolism of ""the beasts"" is never made very clear; I kept waiting for a transformation or at least a spiritual revelation that never arrived. What does happen is a little girl soldiers up and hardens herself to meet adversity why still retaining the dreams and needs of such a small child. The cinematography is interesting, especially the party scenes, but the film is essentially gritty, showing the darkest side of a poor and deeply damaged bayou community. Another tough one to watch."
3,Beautifully Crafted - Depressing Subject - Doesn't Enrich Us,"The moral of the story we derived was that no matter how poor or ignorant you are and what deplorable conditions you live in and raise your children in - as long as you have beer, you can survive.The movie was very well crafted and the lead actors were excellent but the story is very depressing and does nothing to enrich us. I would not want to see it again or recommend it to our friends."
3,Good Visuals - Weak Plot,This story went nowhere! The lead characters were played superbly. The photography captured the bayou country of southern Louisana beautifully. Overall a little weird.
2,Headspinning story with little rhyme or reason,"Interesting enough diversion, but a story that never really went anywhere.A very poor US family leaving on the bayou in LA.A daughter and father that have no clue how to survive in the world as most Americans know it and when given the opportunity turn that down for their run down humble home presumably because they will be taken advantage of if they do not. It's an interesting peak into the lives of the less fortunate without a compelling argument for why many stay that way although that seems to be the only possible message of this movie. Did not move us to cheer, cry or even think that much except to wonder about the character's motivation - i.e. ""What were they thinking?""This is not something I would recommend to most movie goers."
5,Amazing product!!,"This product is amazing! My husband and I had been sleeping in separate rooms for months. We decided to try SnoreStop out of desperation. It works so great! He hardly snores at all now. As soon as he doesn't use it for a few days it just starts up again.So I make sure and remind him every night. It has to be the last thing you do before bed and you can't eat or drink after you use it. It took about a week before we noticed it working so don't get skeptical if it doesn't work the first night you use it. Also,you have to use it regularly every night for it to continue to work. I am a firm believer in this product!"
2,it doesn't work!!!,i am snoring very loud and this product doesn't help at all. don't waste your money. i wasted mine.
1,Unfortunately it does not work,I have tried many stop snoring products. I purchased this one in hopes of it working so I could avoid wearing a mouth guard or something in my nose. Unfortunately I snored and stop breathing as I do with out the spray :(
4,Snorestop stops snoring,Snorestop really works! By the second night of use I had completely stopped snoring and have had greatly reduced occurences of snoring. I highly recomend this product.
4,Helps reduce snoring,"This product is easy to use and does help to reduce snoring, although it did not stop it completely. My only problem is that it seems to keep me awake for a while after I first use it. This product supposedly has no side effects, but the three nights I used it, I had trouble falling asleep; perhaps it would help to use at least an hour before going to bed."
3,didn't work,"bought for husband, but he still snores, it says it works for people who have inflamed tissue. So I assume this is not what causes his snoring. So it might work for someone else. This is why I gave it 3 stars, its not a problem with the product."
5,Works to reduce volume of snoring,Worked for me and my step-father. Super easy to use. Now part of our routine. No after effects or harsh taste.
3,"Works somewhat, sometimes","This homeopathic snore spray does seem to mitigate my snoring somewhat, based on feedback from my significant other. It is not a panacea, but it seems to be better than nothing. Even when using it, some nights I apparently snore badly, other nights a little, and some nights not at all. When I combine the spray with the SnoreStop pills, it seems to work better... but still not perfectly. Worth a shot, for sure!"
1,This Is a Horrible Product,"There are several things wrong with this product: 1) Price. Absurdly overpriced, even if it worked. It's over $40 an ounce, people - That's over $5000 a gallon. 2) Product design. It is unbelievably difficult to get the spray to dispense properly. 9 times out of 10 it does not spray at all, just dribbles out a drop or two. I've tried it from every conceivable angle and position - no better luck, and no consistent way found to get it to spray. 3) It simply does not do what it claims to do. I used the product until the bottle was empty with no noticeable reduction in snoring.Do yourself a favor - save your $16+ and either buy one of the mouthpieces being advertised all over the internet (I'm looking at either a PureSleep or a SnoreRX) or go get a sleep study done. Either option is an infinitely wiser choice than this junk."
2,It may work for some but not me,I've used a product like this in the past and it worked great but not this one. I keep searching for the one I had before but haven't re-discovered it yet. This wasn't it.
5,saved my sleep,"I tried this product thinking it probably will not work. At the time of purchase I even asked about a refund if I was not happy. Wow was I amazed, this product worked the very first night and has worked ever since. My wife is happy and so am I."
3,Design problems make it hard to use.,"Having used the tablets, which are sugar based; I thought I would try the liquid. It's glycerine/alcohol based, you spray it in the back of your throat. I am concerned about tooth decay. And you don't want to brush your teeth AFTER you use it, because the toothpaste can antidote the homeopathic medicine - rendering it useless.The spray is more expensive to use than the tablets, and even more so because of the difficulty of aiming it correctly. Under the tongue is easy, but hitting the back of your throat while keeping the bottle upright is really a chore. You end up using much more of it than necessary.It's a visually appealing design, but not very functional. A spray bottle that you squeeze would work better. Also, it's got a lot of hard to recycle plastic parts.By the way, I think the product does help to reduce snoring, but I've gone back to the sugary tablets, followed in 20 minutes or so by a careful rinsing."
1,Waste of money,I tried this product and my gal said it didn't work.She got no sleep.Im moving on to a sleep apnea mouth piece.Dont waste your money with silly mouth sprays.
1,It doesn't work and cot to much!,I tried the product and it just doesn't work! There are better product out there that work for cheaper price.
2,Snore Stop,It promised to end my snoring. It didn't. I did not get value for my money. Very disappointed!. My husband has resorted to wearing ear plugs.
1,The only way it stops storing is by keeping you awake,"If you were designing a drug to help people sleep, what would be the LAST ingredient you would use? Speed? Not if you are making Snore Stop.I tried this once. Within 15 minutes I was drenched in sweat, my heart was racing and I was nauseous. I spent the night moving in and out of a nightmarish sleep. You would have better luck smoking crack before going to bed. I can't imagine what would happen if someone accidentally sprayed this thing 4 or 5 times. I thought I was going to have a heart attack. I wouldn't be surprised to find that some people have after using this product."
1,worst packaging ever,I haven't even tried the product. The packaging was so so bad I was tempted to throw it away without even trying it
1,Not what Laura would have wanted,"Glossy, impersonal, poor arrangements, nosey intrusions into Laura's own stage notes...I found this offensive and just commercial. The first Laura songbook was gorgeous from cover design/photo, selected drawings, photos, and great arrangements. This is a poor, poor sequel. It is not what Laura would have wanted to express her music, thoughts, ideas, and certainly not emotions. I hope lyrics and reminiscences gets back to the earth mother and sister we all love."
1,Not What Laura Would Have Wanted,"This glossy-covered, personally intrusive, poorly arranged, and overly simplified congomeration did not reflect what Laura would have wanted. The first collection of her songs is the most beautifully thought out and presented amalgam of this brilliant and unique songstress' musical and artistic productions."
2,It's Hot... But...,"I'm a fan of Nina Bangs and have been reading her for several years. This is not her best effort. The characters are a little flat, and the secondaries are just annoying. It reads like it was thrown together in a hurry. I was very disappointed, in fact I put it down twice before forcing myself to finish it. It's been on my shelf for a long time so I don't think it was my frame of mind while reading it. I'll continue to read the next 2 in the series (I already bought them) and hope the slump is a one time thing."
1,This book bites...and not in the good way,"I ended up skipping huge chunks of this book due to characters like Sparkle Stardust and Asima. While the premise seemed interesting, Ms. Bangs delivers a flat book of 2-d characters that have no real spark between them. Skip this book and go read Unwed and Undead by Davidson instead."
4,wicked fun,"Wow! Nina Bangs has some imagination. She takes a simple idea, and just expands it into something that is so special, that as a reader you feel so blessed to have discovered it. These characters don't come around everyday, as Donna Nolan finds out. I mean, in her wildest dreams as a talk show host looking for the weird and wacky in the Castle of Dark Dreams, did she ever think she would come across: a wizard, a talking cat, a cosmic trouble maker named Sparkle, a sex demon, an immortal warrior, and at last Eric McNair the vampire. Not only does Donna fall in love with Eric, she also ends up doing some of the most three dimensional love scenes I have ever read. Wicked Nights is wicked fun!"
5,Humourous,I love both the Castle of Dark Dreams and the WooWoo Inn series. I enjoy the light humor and romantic misadventures.
1,Wicked Nights/Night Bites from Kathy,"Sorry, but I thought these two were totally inane. I'm willing to use a little extra imagination, but these were just too way out there. I read Night Bites first, and names like Sparkle Stardust,Ganymede, and Woo Woo Inn were just the first clue. I'm afraid Wicked Nights wasn't much better. Neither the characters nor plots had any substance. I don't think Nina Bangs would be an author on any of my future reading lists."
3,Creative but unusal tale..,"A trilogy - book 1 - The Castle of Dark Dreams, is an adult amusement park where women take role-playing to new heights. Vampire story.Reviewed by Janet Sue Terry author of the Set Me Free Series -Possibilities and Resolutions. President of Just My Best Book Publishing Company. www.janetsueterry.com"
4,"Great Book for ""interaction""","This is a wonderful way to capture a young one's attention. What child doesn't enjoy seeing their own picture?! To see their own face on each page really helps them focus on what the book says is happening on that page, plus it just makes the child happy!"
1,What a waste,"I find this book, as well as all others by this author, to be very degrading to dogs. I can't believe any dog-loving person would support the humiliation and exploitation of animals by purchasing this book, which is filled with a poor little dog (named Zelda) being dressed up in ridiculous costumes. There is a brief one or two-line sentence written by the author under each silly photograph. Supposedly they are wise thoughts, but of course they are not. Horrible."
5,Quick delivery.,It is a wonderful addition to my kitchen. It reminds me why I love bulldogs so much. Great yearly calendar.
4,Cute and sweet.,"I found this movie very cute and sweet. However, it did seem more for a younger audience that the Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.By the way do you get it Kanga and Roo? Kangaroo! This movie was about Roo and his new best fried a heffalump named Lumpy. They have fun playing together until Lumpy get lost and can't find his mom. Latter on Roo get into trouble and his new friend has to learn a new skill to save him. If you want to know what new skill he has to lean you'll just have to watch this movie. :-)"
5,Really fun for the whole family!,"This is a really fun movie about friendship. It is cute with lots of funny humor for kids. The movie's object is to show that things aren't always as they appear, even if everyone around us is convinced that something is really bad or really good."
5,nice,i have always wondered what they were talking about at disneyland. now i know. it was a cute movie and im glad i bought it
4,Great Pooh Movie,A Great movie to watch with your little one. It teaches your little one to get to know someone before you judge them. It's really cute. This interpretation of heffalumps is A lot less creepy than the original Winnie the Pooh.
2,Poor DVD quality,"This DVD was rated very good. The first time I played it for my daughter it froze numerous times. As I tried to restart it, it would not even let me stop the movie and restart it. My daughter loved what she saw, but I was highly disappointed in the quality of this movie."
3,Mixed Message Pooh Movie,"Okay I know this is a kid's movie and I should not be so critical but I agree with a lot of the reviews on Amazon that don't like the mixed messages. A good example is Roo obeys his mother but talks Lumpy into disobeying his mother (twice). The voice acting for Lumpy is so sugary sweet it makes me want to jump out a window. Anyway, for a young child this is a good movie if you are trying to stay away from violence and questionable language."
2,Pooh's Heffalump Movie,My five year old daughter was not engaged by the story... has not asked to watch it more than the initial look. The story did not grab her.
5,This One's For You Lumpy!,"We just got this movie yesterday and I think my 4 year old has watched it non stop. She wants a heffalump of her own now. lol. I must admit, this movie is super cute!!"
5,Among the best,"This film is in my (at least moderately educated) opinion one of the best kids' movies of all time, and it is almost undoubtedly the best ""Pooh film"" ever made. The story line is engaging. It teaches a wonderful lesson about tolerance and understanding of differences. Carly Simon's soundtrack is catchy, memorable, and generally outstanding--you'll find yourself sporadically marching about singing and whistling highlights (""In the naaaaaaame of the hundred acre wooooooood, we claaaaaaaim you in the naaaame of the hundred acre wooooooood!""). Last and by no means least, the whole production staff appear to have been pirated from Miyazaki-san's studio with the result that, atop all this movie's other splendid characteristics, the animation is thoughtful, detailed, amusing, and insightful. The kids will enjoy watching this over and over, and the adults will, too."
1,Thank you for ruining Pooh...,This movie is a sad discrace to other pooh movies. In this movie at one point Pooh Rabbit and Tigger are chasing the baby heffalump and there is bad music playing. They have actually made these beloved characters into villians. If you are not familiar with the old pooh stories this may not bother you but if you are a Winnie the Pooh lover like my family this is a sad sad thing they have done. Not to mention the moral basis for the movie seems to be dissobey your mom because she doesnt know that people who are different are fun.
4,LUMPY IS THE BEST!!!,"This is the BEST pooh movie I have ever seen!!! Lumpy and Roo will steal your heart! Very touching and special. I would have given it 5 stars, but Carly Simon's songs stink and her voice is annoying. That was the only bad part about the movie. Other than that, it is sooo cute! A+"
1,Normally love Disney .....,"I was very excited to view this movie with my two year old. However, I was very dissappointed with this one. Carly Simon writes and sings most of the songs.... all just plain sappy and annoying. The story is written very poorly...The characters seem hollow and uninteresting. I have seen so many Disney movies over the years, and this one is my least favorite."
4,Pooh's Heffalump Movie,"I took my 4 year old daughter and 4 year old nephew to see this movie. It was incredible, the best Pooh movie I've seen in a long time. The kids sat through the whole thing very well and really enjoyed it. It had some very valuable lessons."
4,heartwarming movie,"i thought it was a wonderful movie, that taught alot about the importance of friendship,and it teaches that nomater how different we are were all the same on the inside."
1,video play suck's!!,"disc was all scratched and didn't even play in my region 1 dvd player! If this is your kinda service is ,it stink's!!!!"
1,Cracked,Sure I bought it used bit the disc was cracked I was saving it as a present for my brother. And didn't take it out of the package until last week to wrap it as a Christmas present and notice the crack
4,Sweet,I went with my two friend and their two nephews. I enjoyed the movie it was funny and taught kids the importance of friendship. The movie showed kids that they need to understand their fears. The hundred acer wood group is afraid of the heffalumps but the heffalumps are also afraid of the hundred acer wood group.The movie begins with the hundred acer wood group hearing a strange noise early in the morning. The group decides that the noise is from a scary heffalump. The gang decides to go one a search for the heffalump so they can be the first to capture one. The only problem is the group will not let roo go with them. Roo sneakes off early in the morning to find his prey. He later meets up with lumpy. Lumpy is so adorable. The other group has found nothing but end up catching each other. The ending of the movie is similar to the rest of these types of movie. Everyone is learning a lesson and living happily ever after.
5,Sweet and suspenseful!,"Pooh movies are still as sweet as they have ever been. My children ""5"" & ""7"" still love watching them. This one is suspenseful as we wait to see what a Heffalump really is and what it will look like. The Pooh movies always have a good teaching lesson in them as well and great music."
2,Not What It Says,"Beware! This is not what it says on the cover. For anyone who is considering this set as a replacement for vinyl or cassette originals, do not buy this. The Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, Chuck Berry and much of the Fats Domino are live recordings. This is not specified. In addition, these are the only recordings I have ever purchased which list no details of the recordings - not even the composers or publishers! The only reason I gave this set two stars is that it may be of interest for the Elvis interviews or for fans of Rock 'n' Roll who are interested in the live recordings of the artists listed."
5,The best,"Film doesn't get any better than this, in a splendid production.Ignore the popcorn movies and have yourself a real treat, watching truly great actors doing what they do best.Capable of Murder"
5,A Rather English Marriage,"This movie has it all; sadness, humor, food for the soul, and terrific acting! The characters are so different and well developed. It is a case study on how different individuals react to life and death. There are the ""givers and takers"" in this world and each one is here for a purpose. Each character has to survive as they best know how. This movie is very entertaining!"
3,interesting .good story,but not riveting make sure you put subtitles on as dialogue gets very gravelly......albert finney is sad to see and sometimes hard to understand
1,Stupid,"This movie had a lot of potential considering the plot, but it ended up being just plain stupid."
4,Is the New Testament Reliable,"I had to read this book and wrote a book review for my New Testament class. The language was not too hard to understand so it was a quick read. Although I didn't quite see the relevancy of the last chapter about the comparison of the religion, I think it's a book worth reading."
5,The miracolous thing of this book is that,IT'S A WARNING ABOUT THE FIST SIGNS OF ANOREXIA !When you can still fight with the BEST OF PROBABILITIES AGAINST THIS LETHAL ILLNESS
2,Just average,"The writing was average and the plot was average. For a Great Depression book, the story didn't seem realistic. The attempted rape and rescue seemed unrealistic. The adoption seemed off. The story's ending was not believable."
4,Good read,Well I have to say I liked this book really well until the very end. It was a little confusing in the end and I did have to go back and reread it. It was a good book though and I am glad I read it. Not as good as Alice's Tulips but still worth the time.
2,Disappointing,"I read ""The Diary of Mattie Spenser"". It was a much better book than this one. I never felt like I got to know the characters except for Queenie and Rita. I never cared for the whodunit part of the story. I agree with the reviewer who said it was like two different books. However, I didn't care for either one. I didn't understand the end of it. A very shallow read."
2,Mixed Feelings,"When I finished this novel, I couldn't decide how I felt about it. From other reviews most people LOVED it, giving it 5 stars or a few rated it very POOR. Neither rating captured my sentiments. Two other reviews did capture it's essense-NO FRIED GREEN TOMATOES and another that explained-it's not a bad novel and if you're looking for a quick, light, southern cozy/light mystery read this is for you. I don't believe it's an ""If you loved Divine Secrets, you'll love this."" I don't think it's as good as the Ya-Ya's. And it did cross my mind that the story is very similar to Fried Green Tomatoes. If you take it for what it is-a quick, light read, you won't be disappointed."
2,Quilting club,"This is a good book to illustrate women's lives during this time period and also demonstrates the loyalty these women had for each other. Other than that, this is a book for people who would rather read simple books rather than good literature."
3,Slow at first; but gains momentum.,"Easy quick read. The first half did not grab me, but I enjoyed the second half of the book. I'm glad I finished it."
1,Mannered and Self-consciously Folksy,"Enough with the cliches and the cutesy ""teaching the meaning of friendship"" quips! Show! Don't tell! And please! Don't beat me over the head with their goodheartedness. . .The wonderful thing about many really great writers including Ellen Gilchrist, Dorothy Allison, William Styron and others is that while they may be writing about simple people in hard times, they manage to elevate their existence to a state of grace for the reader. They do not insult the intelligence of their readers by assuming that all people who live on farms and quilt as a hobby are as naive and dunderheaded as Queenie. I should have had gloves on while I was reading it was so syrupy. . ."
3,Two books in one -- and only one was great,"There are really two books here. First, there's the warm, funny and at times poignant story of people living through the despression in drought-striken Kansas. This is the good book, filled with wonderful observations of life and friendship. Then there's the ""murder mystery"" which is far fetched and totally unnecessary. Frankly, I couldn't have cared less ""who done it"" and would have been much happier having the entire book devoted to the everyday life of these intriquing characters. It didn't need a mystery to ""liven"" things up.The mystery doesn't totally ruin the book, but it does weaken what would have been an insightful character study."
1,"Insipid, juvenile junk--zero stars","I just read this book for a book club, otherwise I never would have finished it. This book is nothing but insipid pulp. There are no discussion worthy avenues of thought presented by the author. The main character, Queenie, is shallow and immature, and not worth getting to know. The characters are supposed to be suffering during the depression, but everyone has plenty to eat, money for gas, and all strangers that come to town are taken care of -- very unrealistic. The author tries to shock us with a relevation about the character's quilting club in the last quarter of the book, but I only laughed at the absurdity of the story-line."
3,"Hard to get into, but ended okay","This is the first book I have read by this author and I am not sure if I will read her others. I found it a chore to read until about the fifth chapter when the ""mystery"" began. Granted, I was eager to find out who did it and was surprised by the outcome, which I guess is a telltale sign of a good mystery. Don't get me wrong, THE PERSIAN PICKLE CLUB is not a bad novel. Actually, the story is quite good once it starts rolling. I probably won't be as quick to recommend this to others as I have been with other novels. But if you want a quick ""mini-mystery"" to pass the time, this book will provide."
4,Great Companion to the Ya-Ya Sisterhood,"If you liked The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, you'll find this book very satisfying. Set in a different place and time it also recounts the trials and tribulations of ""sisterhood"". It is a short read but worthwhile. There is a somewhat predictable mystery but this doesn't detract much from the story. A great book to compare with the Ya-Ya's in book club or with a friend."
4,A Gentle Read with a Touch of Mystery,"This is a read for those of us who enjoy the comraderie of fellow beings....not beset on high society or ladder climbing. We return to the past, the depression years, the search for what truly is valuable---the comraderie of our friends. I figure that if an author is able to instill in us a yearning for the times she writes about, she is a success. Pick up this book for a relaxing entertaining read. She adds a touch of suspense and mystery--and a tad of violence. I highly recomend this stragely titled book."
4,"Completly real characters, straight from the Heartland","What struck me about The Perisan Pickle Club was the amazing similarities between the women in the book, and the women I know who have roots in America's Heartland - like me. I wasn't even born until 1958, currently live in California, and have never owned a farm. So my roots are pretty deeply buried. But there I was, in those pages, none the less.I'd recommend it as an enjoyable way to better understand our heritage as Americans, and as American woman in particular."
4,"This book is no ""Fried Green Tomatoes.""","This book was recommended to me as similar in feeling to ""Fried Green Tomatoes."" It's not. It's an enjoyable read, but there are too many minor characters to confuse you, and the ""solution"" to the mystery is something you've seen countless times before. I really did enjoy all the quilting explanations and folklore references, however! This book is definitely better than another one of Dallas's, which I just read: ""Buster Midnight's Cafe."""
1,"Too quaint, with pasteboard characters","A friend recommended this book to me, saying that it was a wonderful book about women's lives. Unfortunately, I found the characters to be very flat and entirely unbelievable. In addition, I had in mind that this book would show some positive aspects about housewives and farmwives. However, the goals and ideals of this club seemed to reinforce the negative stereotypes of women, both who work outside of the home and those who stay at home. The context showed Rita who had goals other than babies and bottles, to be a hussy. While, Queenie Bean was the epitome of the perfect woman, thus reinforcing stereotypes. Very disappointing"
5,Unique Tale of a different time in American history,I enjoyed the book The Persian Pickle Club. It was a unique tale of a different time in America. Being from a rural background in the Midwest I could understand these women facing the drought in the 1930's but what I have never faced is the severe depression upon the whole country. The book had great characters and unusual twist. I would highly recommend it.
4,Small town life is not always what it seems,"Queenie Bean, a young wife living in Kansas during the Depression has no friends her own age, but she has the life-long friendship of the other women in her quilting group, the Persian Pickle Club. Then a young man from a local family returns with his young wife who Queenie Bean takes under her wing and befriends. Rita, however, is more interested in becoming a reporter and uncovering the secret of the dead body that is unearthed in the town than she is in learning to quilt. What Rita learns instead is a lesson in lifelong friendship and loyalty. The Persian Pickle Club is a quick read without being too fluffy."
3,Persian Pickle Club,"I enjoyed this book but had trouble keeping track of who was who. I wish I had kept a ""scorecard"" and written down each of the ladies' names and who they were, it would have made it less confusing for me. However, I thought the book presented the importance of friendship well and was good at keeping secrets as well. Definitely read, just write down who is who!"
5,Exciting and refreshing,"The musicianship and more importantly the creativity on display here is exciting, refreshing and a must listen."
4,Punk Rock Swinging Lounge style.,"This album is a must have for any ageing punk rocker who might be settling down just a bit. Some punk rock classics sung Vegas complete with the Chi-Chas (Check out Instituanalized) Covers from the likes of Social D, and of coarse Black Flag. If your are into the swing scene this will be a blast also."
1,Save your money and time,"Quite possibly the worst CD I've ever heard..No actually the worst cd I ever heard.There is no rhythm, no rhyme, no talent, on a scale of one to ten I give it a 1 for coming up with the idea..but the musical KAPOW never quite happened. There is too much time spent on interviews...more than likely to fill the otherwise hollow tracks..and the band..and the singer. Just say NO!I hated this cd so much that I should just give it for free to the first person who wants it however I feel so strongly about the quality of it that I refuse to do anything other than put on high in the microwave for fifteen minutes."
3,Don't Let Me have to read much more by Rankine,It's not that the book isn't good or didn't catch some of my interest but I spent most of the time reading thinking where is she going with this. I had to think just a little too hard to really understand where she was going with this story...or series of events...pictures of tv's...I am just not sure I truly got what she was going for. The book seemed too disconnected from its audience.
1,TS Eliot she's not,"Can't think of anything coherent to say about this; bought it on the strength of the Amazon reviews, but it's not really poetry at all in my book (and I've a pretty broad definition of poetry). Pedestrian doesn't begin to cover it; self-indulgent might. It was the stultifying notes that really got me (try the half-page on the Kennedies p140) which seem to be aimed at 15-year-old Martians; they might stand up as a amusing artwork on their own though, a la Paul Violi's Index or Frank Kuppner's sublime Arioflotga. Sorry, but no..."
2,bad revision,"I have used both the intermediate and advanced versions of this book. I got the new edition of the advanced book and was very disappointed. I don't like the topics of the lectures as well as the earlier edition. They weren't as clearly organized as the others. The professors seemed to ramble more. Furthermore, I didn't like the outlines for the lectures they gave in the new book. Finally, I didn't find as many note-taking tips. If you can, get the earlier edition of this book."
5,The future of music!,"""When I'm Old"" is a smash hit!! These guys are incredible.... Exhibition is the future of music.... Gutsy, dancy, really great pop music, you won't be disappointed!"
4,Great! Can't wait to play it again and again and again.,"Especially like ""Tomorrow the Rain"". Can see that this group will hit the charts. Art Direction and Design - WONDERFUL!"
4,It's a pretty good product,"I bought this product about a month ago for my G-1000 phone and it's pretty-good and I'm still learning how to use the many functions and/or services you can utilize. I have the Ostia version 7.00 and the map version 5.00-which is the program that stores the maps of your choice. Unfortunately they(Pharos) don't have and will not produce any more maps programs that are current. The last upgrades for their maps for this version(5.00),is 2004. So there's no more new maps from 2004 which means no more new streets and highways that are probably being made as of now through-out the U.S.A.All-in-all it's a very good product, at least in my book."
4,entertaining but...,"it is diffrent, and some how entertaining ,with lots of nudity , some of the scenes actually erotic , but it is not tipical pink the story doesn't make sense . I bought this DVD from mike's video through Amazon , and had some problem with it ,so I left a bad feed back . The seller contacted me and resolve the problem. seller is friendly and courtious, and I will buy from them again ."
1,one of the worst movies I've ever seen,"So, the story behind this movie seemed interesting; a director has to make a ""pink film"", and uses it to convey his own message, to develop his own movie in between the softcore sex scenes.But he gets everything wrong from the beginning to the end. Well I should be fair; we couldn't even make it to the end of this movie.Surprisingly bad acting is coupled with random sentences which try to sound intellectual; however, in practice this ""intellectual"" part is probably the deeper dumbness you can find in an already dumb script.As if this wasn't enough, the movie is wrapped in an unpleasant sexist concept around sex scenes, which gets to its climax in a trivialized rape sequence which made us viewers think now the movie wasn't even worth to make fun of anymore."
3,The Lost Storm,"This movie started out with a lot of promise, but got lost along the way. It initially started like an end-times tribulation flick. But when the stranger (Luke Perry) came to the Grady's home, there was a complete re-direction of the film.After the storm dies down, all the animals and most of the people in the town, apart from a few vagabonds, are also gone. At this point the concept of the last days also dies down.From here on in it turns into a mild thriller, where the objective is no longer to find all the missing people or animals, but to find out who Silas (Luke Perry) really is.In the end it is a mild action picture that seems to have lost its way, maybe because of the storm."
3,Zombies rule!,"Kinda interesting...plot was pretty good. Acting was believable even if the storyline was a little hard to follow.If Lauren Holly would have shown her nekkid sweater puppies, her goody box or both, I would have watched this one again. She didn't and the movie suffered from it.C'mon Lauren show them things...everybody is doing it!"
3,Lost the plot partway through,"Great cast, very good acting, but the plot was weak at best. It started off very strong and then just tumbled down hill. This movie is also a very good example of why ""city"" people should not live in the country. As someone who spent most of her live on 100 acres I have to say that being on a farm without backup resources such as fuel, a generator bigger than something sitting in a wheelbarrow, extra food stores, and other heavy mobile equipment is very rare. Big thumbs down in believability from me in that department for this movie. The ending of the movie was awful. They give you a big lead up and the questions that you have at the beginning of the movie are never answered."
2,As close as you can get to a good Uwe Boll movie,"This movie came SO close to being something decent, which is surprising considering Uwe Boll's name was attached. It seemed like he was trying for a character-driven story about a fractured family struggling to reconnect in the face of the (apparent) end of the world, and for the first two acts that's what viewers get. It's not perfect in its execution, but it's promising enough.Then the third act comes along, and the plot thread involving Luke Perry's character takes such a wild left turn it derails everything the filmmakers built up earlier. It certainly wasn't a predictable twist, but from a characterization standpoint it made no sense, and the climax as a result feels like a huge letdown.Overall this was more palatable than most of Uwe Boll's movies, but a botched ending rather ruined the whole thing for me."
1,Too bad you cannot give minus stars,"I just watched this movie. It was HORRIBLE. Do not waste your time. The title is very misleading. There is a storm and it takes part during the first 5 minutes of the movie and then it is gone. The story line does not exist. There is a ""sex"" scene in it, and that is why it probably got an R rating, and maybe the director thought that would keep people watching it, but don't waste your time."
2,BOLL OF CRAP,"Uwe Boll is back adding another disaster to his filmography.Ultimately the movie makes no sense and its slow meandering pace has no climactic payoff. Why has everyone but our three leads and a handful of ruffians vanished? Where did they go? Who is Silas really? Tim McGregor's script is far too ambiguous and unbelievable and Boll's direction pedestrian. Oddly enough, the performances from Steve Bacic, Lauren Holly and Luke Perry rise above the material. I vow to avoid any more Boll movies!"
1,Worst movie I have seen in long time,This movie has no plot! IT has has NO story other then some unkown end of the world theme. IT HAS THE WORST ending I have ever seen!
1,Not Gray but okay lens cloth,"The cloth I got was not gray. It is a blueish cloth with a shine to it. It is quite a bit lighter than my grey card so it will probably be too far off to want to meter against it.I think I will return it. The item is 4.75"" x 6"" and blue. The package has a sticker on it describing it as 8""x8"" and gray.If you are looking for a gray card don't get this item. If you are looking for a lens cloth this may do for you."
1,Epom,"I ordered this because I needed an 18% gray card, and I thought it would be cool if i could use it as a cleaning cloth too. However, they sent me a bright blue cleaning cloth, which is NOT at all what I ordered. They are trying to sell this as something that it is not. I would not buy this product if you are looking for a gray card."
5,1975 WAS A GREAT YEAR FOR ME!,I bought this album at a record store in Southern California in 1975 and I still have it! I would love to be able to listen to it on CD. It's a pity and a shame that it isn't available on CD because more people would get to enjoy the duo pre-Fleetwood.
5,Found in a Discount Bin in 1977,"I found this album in a discount bin at a used record store in 1977. Wow what a find. This has been one of my favorite LP's for 30 years. Luckily my LP is pristine. I just digitalized it using a USB turntable and am enjoying it again on CD. If you ever get a chance to listen, don't pass this gem up. Stevie's voice is full of youth and has all the sweetness and none of the hoarseness that plagued her in later years. Crying in the Night and Races Are Run are highlights with the pre-Mac version of Crystal topping the later version."
5,One of the greatest albums of all time,"As has been repeated often, it's a tragedy to modern cultural history that this album has never been released on CD. I've always loved it, but I didn't find out till many years after first discovering it that Lindsey Buckingham and I grew up in the same town at the same time, neighbors to Ty Cobb, Willie Mays and others of that ilk.Lately I was talking to a young father who said that jamming with his 12-year-old daughter on guitar playing songs of the '60s and '70s was his latest pleasure. I couldn't help but recommend BUCKINGHAM NICKS as a great learning tool. As a fan of the Buckingham-Nicks era of Fleetwood Mac, he was unaware of their earlier eponymous album. Hopefully, his daughter will now become aware, and these great songs and this great style will live on in yet another generation."
3,Shun Ken Onion,Good for Stainless Steel. I had a High Carbon Japanese knife that cost me $80 that was sharper and stayed sharper but would instantly rust if you didn't wipe the blade. Really designed for vegetables only. The blade broke cutting the top off a baby coconut. The Shun Ken Onion blade is a work horse. Doesn't rust and probably whack away at baby coconuts all day (but not as sharp as I was lead to believe from the reviews) I'll put it to the sharpening stone and see what happens. But I have the feeling if you are used to high carbon Japanese steel this won't replace it. Different knifes for different purposes that have different advantages. I gave it three stars for this reason. For a high end $ work blade it would get 4 stars.
4,Great knife - a little weak on fit and finish,The knife is a great size and shape for smaller work that you might have used a pairing knife for in the past. The handle and fasaners aren't as well done as our other two ken onion's so that is why the mark is a little lower.
5,Ken Onion 8-Inch Chef's Knife,"A really great carving knife with a super sharp edge, Don,t just use it for carving but chopping, mincing etc."
1,Shun Ken Onion Chips,"I bought this knife about 2 years ago. I really love the look, but it was a bit big for me.You have to use the holder that comes with it as it doesn't fit in a knife block.Anyway, last week I was washing it by hand as I always do, and noticed 2 circular chips out of the blade. I am not sure how this happened, as I have never used it for meat only vegetables.I did notice that it dulled rather fast, and I have used a knife sharpener on it.This was an expensive knife, which is called a Chefs Knife, I had no idea that it wasn't to be used on meat or bones. I would have never bought it had I known. I have never had a knife chip or break so this was a surprise.I was just looking for someplace that would sharpen and repair knives when I saw the reviews so thought I would add my 2cents."
1,Chipped after one use,"I bought this knife as an anniversary present for my wife. I thought it was time she had a professional chefs knife. On the first use, which was to cut a pork roast, the blade chipped and bent in several places.I'm returning this knife.While it seemed like it would be nice for fruits and vegetables, it apparently was not meant for cutting meat."
1,$$$???,You spent HOW MUCH money?For a KITCHEN KNIFE?People in this country truly do have rocks in their heads.
3,Excellent knife however,Great quality but expensive hard to keep sharp for amatuer chefs. The stand cracks easily and is a thin wood with back and front screwed in from the bottom and doesnt match the quaiity of the knife even though a great idea.No way to get a replacement for the stand eithier.the knife is a little off baalnce also. The same manufaturer makes the Alton Brown Signature knives which seem to have better balance and design.
3,Don't cut meat with a bone,"While I liked the knife very much, I was told it was an all purpose Kitchen knife, IT IS NOT!The Warranty is void if you have a problem cutting anything with a bone in it.The blade is very thin and works great for fruit vegetables, boneless meats.I accidentally ran my blade over a breast bone in a chicken breast and 2 chips came out of the blade rendering it useless without a repair.Shun said it was not covered under warranty because I was cutting meat with a bone in it. They might be able to sharpen it out but would not guaranteed it or replace it. These pieces were large and trying to sharpen them out would have seriously changed the balance. They also said the knife was not being made any longer.Be wary this blade is very fragile and not made for all around use."
5,waited too many years for this,"this is a spectacular knife... I cut a whole chicken in half as if it was butter. I definetely feel I ought to never have waited for purchasing this knife, as it makes the cooking experience just that much more exciting."
3,"Beautiful, but shoddy construction. Disappointed.","I had been lusting after this knife for a while, and love my other Shun (classic), but was disappointed after taking it out of the box. There was a small gap between the bolster and tang (which a couple other reviewers also noticed), which seemed to offer a moderate risk of food particles getting wedged in the handle over time. But what really pissed me off was that the blade bounced around, emitting an audible click when shaken laterally. For a knife that's this expensive, that crossed into unacceptable. Returned it and grabbed a Kikuichi."
5,Just the best,"I own more than 100 knives made by most well known manufacturers of fine cutlery. I have a masters degree in food science and I worked my way through grad school as a butcher and instructor of meat cutting and meat processing at a major University. This is the finest knife I have ever owned. It is so fun to use I think up things to do with it as entertainment. Take it from an ""expert"" this knife cannot be beat. Read the other positive reviews. I have given this knife to my brother and my son (both are gourmet cooks) and they love it as well. Spend the money and have a ball. I have no use for a reviewer who holds a knife in a store and writes a negative one star review."
1,Shun horrible customer service,We have had our Shun knives for over a year and they have worked great. We sent them to be sharpened and Shun has now outsourced their sharpening to a 3rd party so it cost $70+ to get the knives sharpened. We also had a knife that needed repair work from Shun. It was returned to us severely scratched and we had to pay $20+ in shipping. When I called customer service management at Shun they just said sorry they cannot do anything. We will never buy Shun again.
1,Terrible Customer Service,"I received this knife for Christmas and recently broke it while doing a straight-down cut through cheese that was frozen in the middle.The lead customer service rep at Shun, named Brittany, said ""This is not a chef's knife - it is ONLY for cutting fruits and vegetables. Not meats or anything else."" Thus, they will not honor the lifetime warranty on the knife.I'm extremely unimpressed and will not buy another Shun knife again, and although it was nice for the 3 months it lasted it doesn't seem to be as hardy as a true chef's knife."
4,A. Matthews,"This isn't my first Shun knife and probably won't be the last. Shun knife technology, in my opinion, is more advanced than that of any of the good German steel knives. They are super sharp. This particular knife is designed more for chopping, It is not as well suited for slicing as, say a Santoku with cullens. I was surprised to see the ""bolster"" was not a solid forged peice of the knife, but rather two separate pieces fused to either side of the blade. Also, I have always been told that a sign of a good quality in a knife is when the tang goes all the way through the handle and this one does not. The design of the knife is an aesthetic knockout and I love seeing it on my counter but in my opinion, it isn't as versatile as a regular shaped chef's knife.I have been a restaurant owner and chef, now retired, I have had recipes published in San Diego and Kansas City newspapers, an international BBQ newsletter, and a couple in a Martha Stewart magazine."
5,Great knife!,Great feel in the hand. As a woman this is harder to find. Even my husband was amazed at how sharpe it is.
5,Oh so Good,"This album brings back all the greatest memories of high school. The good times and the bad are felt throughout the album. There is nothing better than Weston when it comes to the uncommercialized sides of punk. If you listen to them, you are a part of them. Just wish they had more albums out there to sample!"
4,ok item,which i had more space they had some pockets 2 the front which i find they could have duplicated in the back
3,it does what we needed,My husband is in a rehab hospital. He watches DVD's almost 24 hours a day. He can reach the case in his bedside table and easily get another DVD when he wants to watch a different DVD. The case fits in the drawer such that even with limited mobility he can lift it out and unzip the case.
4,Pleasent Surprise,"I saw ""Frenchman's Creek"" on my local PBS channel and liked it very much. The sets and costuming were wonderful and the plotline kept me interested. However, the most pleasent surprise was lead actor Anthony Delon. I hadn't heard of him before this film and, unfortunately, haven't heard anything about him since. I hope to see more of his work in the future. In the meantime, I encourage you to view ""Frenchman's Creek."" It's a great escape movie."
1,Hollywood style trash unlike BBC movies,"This movie is nothing like the typical proper movies from BBC of the 17th and 18th centuries such as Pride and Prejudice or Sense and Sensibility. It is full of sexual lust, poor acting, and conduct by the characters which is so unsuitable and improper for the times. It reminded us of Kitty on Gunsmoke, a woman just walking into a bar and stepping up for a glass of booze, in 1689? Ridiculous.The supposed French accents are amateurish. Marriage is scoffed at and mocked like a 21st century piece of Hollywood trash. We stopped this movie before it was half way through and discarded it. Bad show, totally not believable nor credible."
3,Content was worse than expected!,I have seen several Masterpiece Theatre movies on television and never had a problem with content. So I was shocked to find nudity in this film. I thought that the storyline and the characters were all good but as far as some of the scenes go I was disappointed.
1,Terrible!,"I'd been waiting a long time for a remake of the story. I was never pleased with the Joan Fontaine movie, but now I'm beginning to think it has merit. This new production deviates so much from the book that it's unbelievable! I've read the book more than once and was outraged with what they've done with it. Tara Fitzgerald is not at all like Dona St. Columb and looked more like a kitchen wench than a lady. Both she and the Frenchman could have used better hair styles. Daphne DuMaurier would be appalled if she could see the ""liberties"" taken with her book. I just watched about 20 minutes at the beginning and then the ending just to see what they did with it. Changed it too. This has to be one of the worst interpretations of a book I've ever seen."
1,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with this version of Frenchman's Creek. The heroine's acting abilities were fine but the hero's ability is something to be desired. Definitely a B film, not impressed at all. I actually stopped watching it half way through."
2,Looks like more like a draft than a finished novel,"Daniel Silva is a journalist? After reading Michael Connelly's novels, I presumed that journalists make good novelists. Easy to read and knows how to sustain the readers' interest without insulting their intelligence. Silva's ""Mark Of The Assassin"", destroyed that notion.Predictable, it has no suspense whatsoever. Plus, its full of cliches and contrived characterizations. Guess I'll have to wait for the movie. It may be better."
3,Respectable Subway Reading,"An entertaining thriller that has some quirky characters and a suitably paranoid plot to keep you intrigued. But it's not nearly as good as ""The Unlikely Spy,"" which was brimming with character and a real sense of place. What disappointed me most about ""Mark of the Assassin"" is that Silva is touted as having intimate knowledge through his previous work in journalism with the subject he writes about. Yet his grasp of life in wartime London 50 years ago was much more gripping than this one. Maybe that says more about today's life inside the Beltway than Silva's writing style! I'll hope for a return to his premier form in the next novel."
3,"OKAY -- Would make a good ""made for TV"" movie but--","Overall, I enjoyed reading it but it is nothing special -- it was one of those ""nothing else to read at the moment situations. ""Bad men controlling poor President"" stories are getting a little old -- and it reminded me of several other spy novels I've read. Isn't there an Alistair MacLean out there somewhere? (No, it isn't Clancy!)"
4,kept my attention but felt it had a weak ending,"I have not read ""The Unlikely Spy"" but will now purchase the book. Yes, I agree with many other reviewers that it does bring to mind the characters of many of our elected officials; and, yes, it makes you think of the tragic TWA crash. So what! It merely is someone's ideas and beliefs. I, too, have no idea who The Director in this book really is....and, it does have a weak ending. But, I still would recommend it to all readers who enjoy a good thriller!"
3,Mark of Assasin -Silva,"A good read, but not as exciting as previous Silva books I have read. But I always go for Silva books! DJD"
3,"A solid spy tale, but not as good as his other work","I thoroughly enjoy Silva's Gabriel Allon novels. This book does not rise up to the same level. While the plot moves quickly, I felt like I had already read the book before. The main character is a supper CIA agent, who lacks the depth of character of Gabriel Allon. He is a plastic imitation of Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan character. The assassin was your typical cold-blooded former KGB 1000% evil type. The deeply secret international cartel that controlled the senior members of the CIA and other parts of world governments was unbelievable and contrite. Silva's other books are known for their historical research and unique characters. Since this book was set in modern times, Silva was unable to flex one of his primary strengths. From now on, I will stick to the Gabriel Allon books and skip the CIA super agent tales. While there was nothing really bad about the book, it never really rose above the level of being an average run of the mill pulp spy novel."
1,"Derivative, contrived, improbable, and predictable.","Readers of ""The Unlikely Spy"" will be disappointed by Silva's latest work. Its derivative, contrived, and improbable with a tedious subplot about the protagonist's wife's infertility problems. Wouldn't even recommend this book for a long plane ride."
1,A waste of time,"Filter all Amazon reviews of this title to get only the 1 star reviews. Read them. Now, the novel is actually worst than what you just read..."
4,"Not as good as 'Unlikely Spy', but still a terrific read....","This is a fantastic book! True, it lacks a few of the things-like the character development-that made ""Unlikely Spy"" an INCREDIBLE book, but I still rate it better than 90% of its' genre. If you liked Daniel Silva's 1st book, I think you'll find equal enjoyment here....I did!!!"
1,a joke,"every character in this book works 16 hours a day and runs 10 miles. the main character is a Dartmouth graduate, knows six languages, and inherited a million dollars when his mother died( and he still finds time to be a spy! ) Now that is fiction. This books stinks! Don't waste your money"
4,one of his best,"I really enjoyed this book. I got turned on to Daniel Silva because his books were available on Kindle, and I have read all of them. I have to say, I liked the characters and pace of this book best. Not high art or anything, but a first class spy novel. Well done."
2,We've seen this mark before . . .,"I read this book at at the same time I was reading Silva's other novel, The Unlikely Spy. I was very disappointed in the same cliche descriptions and character lines. His use of virtually the same description and lines in both books surprised me. Also, the ease with which the assasin dispatched people is lame. Silva tries to give Jean-Paul some depth, but his methods of killing and his thoughts are very predictale and disappointing. If you have read the Unlikely Spy, dont bother with this one!"
2,Disappointing after The Unlikely Spy,"The Unlikely Spy was an exceptional thriller. I felt I had found a major new author of spy thrillers (I haven't given up on him yet) and waited eagerly for his next book. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a stinker. I must say, though, that despite the incredibility of the plot and the cardboard characters, his ability to describe places and to build atmosphere came through brilliantly from time to time. For my own sake, I hope his third book is at least half as good as his first book. I'll be waiting. END"
1,Knowing what I know now...,"If I had read this book when it was published I'm sure I would have had a much different response to it. If, for instance, I could still regard the CIA as a credible agency and not a useless, terrible joke I might have found the premise of a dynamic, competent CIA agent believable. Since the average CIA agent has been proven to be an inept bureaucrat the entire concept of the book is laughable. Add the typical liberal viewpoint of anything conservative and you just have a pale, lifeless version of LaCarre. Too bad since based on ""Unlikely Spy"" I thought I was going to like Silva's books."
5,SPLENDID BOOK!!,"From the introduction, I was unable to put the book down.Mr. Silva is a great story teller. The various locations the story takes place is described in so much detail you feel as if you're watching a movie or you're physically there yourself.Great suspense, surprises... Great BOOK!! I will recommend this book to everyone!!"
3,Beach reading,"Can you say, ""a book wanting to be a summer movie?"" It has all the trappings. Fast moving story, gratuitous sex, plenty of characters, politics, action, violence, and exotic locations. What it lacks is character development that makes you care what happens to any of these people. (And, lots of unlikely situations and responses to those situations.) But, hey!, if you're sitting on a beach and you don't want to engage your brain...it'll wile a few hours away quite nicely."
5,One of the best ever written,This was one of the best books I have ever read. Silva keeps the book going and adds the definite air of intrigue to the plot. A must read.
3,Could of been better,"""Mark of the assassin"" Started with the potential to be a great book, but slip somewhere down the line. It was like the author either stoped caring or he didn't know where to go with it. I was highly disappointed in this novel."
3,"A great ""time-killer"".","Ever find yourself wanting to be entertained, desiring to be educated, but don't want to have to think too hard? Well, here's a fast read that will have you actually look forward to going to bed at night for an hour or so of reading before the lights go out. The geography is accurate, the dialogue is witty and crisp, and the vocabulary is educational. The character development, however, seemed to be somewhat superficial, and the plot was too revealing while it was developing. I would prefer the surprises in the plot to ""hit me hard"" at the end of each chapter, instead of slowly revealing themselves page by page. A reader will ""know"" how the book ends even before he finishes reading it, and that was somewhat disappointing to me."
2,Sophomore effort disappoints.,"I'm sorry, but while THE UNLIKELY SPY was a terrific WW II thriller, complete with a compelling plot and memorable characters, MARK OF THE ASSASSIN seems to have been written by another writer altogether. The characters are stick-thin and the plot is entirely forgetable. I frankly had to force myself to finish it. A major disappoinment."
4,all the atributes,"This thriller carrys all the key situations. Politics, assassins,CIA, and Lawyers. I am now on my third book by this author and will enjoy all his writings. I also enjoy the fact of the killer being a accomplished artist with fine tastes. All fiction eminates fact in my book. Could it be true."
4,Good summer read!,"My first time reading Silva, I found ""Mark"" to be a quick and entertaining summer read. The action was compelling and his decsriptions of locations (having been to most) were dead-on. The ending seemed a little rushed and predictable - but most of this genre do. ""Mark"" is a page turner like early Clancy; lets hope his future work don't begin to bloat with extraneous detail as Clancy's has."
3,Worth reading if you're running out of fresh material.,"I read the Unlikely Spy and really enjoyed it. I was therefore thrilled to see a new Silva book in the paperback rack. Unfortunately, Mark of the Assassin doesn't quite live up to the standard set by its predecessor. It does read fast, which I like, but there just didn't seem enough substance to it. I see that they're already coming out with the sequal pitting our hero against his nemesis yet I feel no sense of urgencey to run out and buy it."
4,Keeps up an excellent pace and is a page turner,"Most of the location settings for this thriller I know personally and the author has captured their ambience well. There is one glaring error though. When he writes about a northern Canadian location its cukoo-land! For a light jet to land on the east coast of Hudson Bay - on a flare-lit runway? Then for the villain to jump in a Range Rover with snow-shoes and dehydrated food? Where's the road? Who lit the flares? The Innuit? How did the vehicle get there? And get out? No roads, no nothing up there buddy! Still, I enjoyed your book Mr. Silva. From a Canadian Film maker."
2,Want a good read like The Unlikely Spy? It's not here.,"I was expecting a good spy novel like Silva's previous The Unlikely Spy, but it definitely wasn't in this book. The Mark of the Assassin is not much more than a cheap knock-off of a Tom Clancy novel -- it even has a whole lot of stock stereotypical characters (the traitor, the love interest, the religiously ferverant crazy person). And if dumb action, stock characters, and impossible situations won't sell this book, why not stick in a whole lot of gratuitous sex? This book is a let down and I'm not look forward to Silva's new book."
3,Too Many Phantom Stereotypes -- Otherwise OK,"Silva's new book is larded with ""beautiful,"" incandescently ""intelligent,"" and, of course, wealthy persons whose fortunes were either inherited or made effortlessly before the book started. Unfortunately, neither the world nor our government is run by these phantoms of character-by-the-number fiction; otherwise, for example, we would not be enmeshed in the current Balkan morass--either causing or suffering the death of so many thousands. Mark of the Assassin is, nevertheless, an OK read for the airport."
2,Ho hum,"Five stars for descrpitions of world geography - the author is evidently well traveled - but the story does not hold up. Can't give away too much to those who want to read it, but most of the key moments in the homestretch defied credibility.I may be getting jaded. Too many of these ""thrillers"" out there that get rave reviews to sucker me in. I like the genre but am missing the mark on the good material."
2,Nothing worth writing home about...,"Spoiler alert.This is my 2nd Silva novel, the first being ""The Unlikely Spy"". My complaints are:1. Why doesn't a well respected (decently paid?) single, female journalist have some kind of alarm system in her downtown D.C. home?2. Why must the novel be ""trailer-trashed"" with the ""F"" word every other page?3. What happened to the bad guys (and gal)?I hope these books get better. But right now - Vince Flynn has Silva beat in every possible way..."
1,A huge disspointment,"I've read all but the first of the Gabriel Allon books and enjoyed them all to various degrees. Under the mistaken notion that this was also an Allon book, I picked it up. It started okay, but immediately started stumbling. Silva knows how to string words together, so I kept reading.*** POSSIBLE SPOILERS ***Then came the conspiracy. It was such a pathetic plot device and one so awkwardly done that I almost laughed out loud. I was tempted to chuck the book across the room, but kept reading out of stubbornness, hoping the book would improve. It did slightly, but then fell off the deep end with a laughably bad and utterly predictable ending. It took deus ex machina to new levels.One nagging problem was how much some of the characters were simply renamed and moved into the Gabriel Allon series. Ultimately, it was for the better, but it was still disconcerting."
4,First Silva but certainly not the last!,"LOVED this! This is my first Daniel Silva book. I really resonated with Michael and Elizabeth, and the way Mr. Silva opened the book (and presented) Delaroche, had me really resonating with him as well. He was a very unconventional antagonist."
2,"Michael Osbourne, you are no Gabriel Allon","Maybe its because I read this after reading 7 Gabriel Allon books back to back, but this earlier work of Silva's can't hold a candle to the newer series. Michael Osbourne is an adequate protaganist, but he pales in comparison to Gabriel. His wife is whiny, the intrigue only fair, and the descriptions and metaphors still on the brink of what they will become in ""The Kill Artist"" and those that follow."
1,Predictable garbage,"Trite, predictable, cliche' and overwritten. Robert Ludlum does it better and less predictably. I won't waste my money buying another Silva book."
4,Unexpected Allon character prequel,"While not featuring as strong a protagonist as Silva's later books featuring Gabriel Allon, it does introduce characters that will be familiar to readers of Silva's Allon novels: the CIA's Adrian Carter, Mossad's Ari Shamron, and others.By itself, it's a solid if unspectacular thriller. But for fans of the Allon series, it has the added delightful dimension of providing backstory to several continuing characters."
2,Entertaining plot ruined by trite domestic subplot ...,This book could've been a fantastic thriller. All of the ingredients are present: a ruthless and brilliant assassin and a capable protagonist as his foil. The book was greatly diminished by it's portrayal of its protagonist's marriage to a high-powered lawyer obsessed with getting pregnant. It's artlessly handled and derails the pace of the book.
5,A Spellbinding Book!,October(DelaRoche) plays the perfect villain in this book. A trained killer from the K.G.B. Now a contract killer for this secret committee he does his job with a relish. The committee that employs October is dedicated to destabilizing the world by creating anarchy. One of October's contract hits results in a terrorist group being hit by the United States. The book stays at a nonstop pace until the very end. Osbourne who also has a history with October has a tremendous struggle that goes to the bitter end. The conclusion of the book leaves room for the sequel. An excellent book.
3,fast paced and full of actions,"The book is full of adventures, going to many exciting places with lots of killings. Two action men : Osbourne and Delaroche.I think if they were brought up the same, they would end up the same killer or good guys. Reminds me of a Robert Ludlum book. Although, I must say, there are too many unnecessary people, could do with less. At times, it's booging slow. Then you have to plough through it before it gets exciting again. If you want action, it's a good read, but should be more inventive. The plot is ,""you've heard it in the news"", sort of thing, the twist in the end is not something new."
2,Disappointing,"Having loved ""The Unlikely Spy"" for its depth, subtlety, and complexity, I was especially disappointed by the shallow, cliched characterizations and predictable plot of ""Mark of the Assassin."" Taken on its own, it has a compelling premise - political and economic intrigue surrounding a terrorist attack on a commercial airline flight. The author raises interesting issues but doesn't go anywhere with them, staying instead with a race-against-time or chase-scene type approach. The ending set the stage for a sequel, but I'm not in a hurry to read it."
2,I had to force myself to finish this book.,"When I first saw this book at the bookstore, I thought it would be a good read. Was I disappointed. Like other reviewers, I thought the plot was weak, characters lacking substance, and the ending of the book was a joke. I wasted my money on this book. The climax of the book was a major let down. I kept looking for more action, but there was none."
4,Deja vue,"A nice mix of suspense, intrigue and mayhem, Silva has written a fun summer read. I can't help but feel I've seen these characters before, however...maybe with different names."
2,"Contrived, old-fashioned, lucky protagonists","Not a very believable thriller, the field agent who only did research now can take out terrorists with a gun? And without combat training, he continues to survive assassination attempts? I found the dialogue repetitive and old-fashioned...who writes ""he would have called his wife, but he didn't want to quarrel with her""? On top of that, there seemed to be a big focus on smoking (maybe Silva has a product placement contract w/Benson & Hedges and Marlboro?). I didn't care about the characters at the end and felt as if this was too easily written...like a movie where everything conveniently happens in the protagonist's favor. Vince Flynn's writing is much tighter and more thrilling, and his characters have much more depth."
5,Great Set,"I'm just a Novice, and this kit makes me super happy. I feel like I have the right tools for the job, and they are good enough for as much as I know. I love rolling out the canvass, and using my special Bonsai set, then rolling it back up when I am done."
5,Prefuse73 - the hip hop evolution revolution...,"I can't say enough about this album; I stumbled upon Prefuse73 after getting the Warp:Routine compilation album (a great mix of the innovative artists under the Warp label, I give it 5 stars as well). I'm mostly a Boards of Canada/Plaid/Autechre/Squarepusher/AphexTwin fan, but Prefuse73 is now one of the highest amongst my ranks. With the exception of the old skool b-boy breaks of the past, I've always thought Hip Hop today is trash along with the rest of the superfluous pop music waste that the general public is assaulted with everyday; but thank god we have Scott Herren to wade through the refuse and literally break it down - This album is TIGHT! Prefuse37 has brought hip hop full circle, shattering the 'bling bling' mentality of todays hip hop 'artists' (pfff) and reconstructing some of the sickest beats you'll ever bounce your head to with the fragments. This is the next level of hip hop MUSIC as it was meant to be!"
4,I Hear music,"Just because it's all cut up, deconstructed, and collaged, doesn't mean there's no songs here. This album flows smoothly into my ears. And I hear music, not deconstructed hip-hop. It seems like a good jazz album to me. It's very pretty and very smooth in parts. It retains some of the best emotive qualities of soul, jazz, and hip-hop. Sure, it's cerebral and is based in abstraction, but there's a certain lushness to the listen. It's totally accessable. People can interpret this album in many ways. Why the assumptions of ""Donkeye?"" People don't have a fear of music. They like what they like."
5,GET IT!,"This CD is very uncanny! The mystical mixing of Hip Hop + Neo Soul sound bit's will captivate your attention throughout the ride of this sound adventure! If you are into music with a creative twist from the normative, my suggestion is to cop a copy!"
4,Hidden,"Excellent Album from this Atlanta based Hip-Hop Crew. Almost 5 STARS!! Nice breaks, not overly produced. If you're into Dan the Automater, Kid Koala, and Del Tha Funkee Homosapien you'll get into this real well too. Buy the LP and the CD together. Money well spent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"a real account, but not a great book.","I bought this to do research about Tommy Lynn Sells for a grad school paper. The descriptions of Sells' crimes and thought processes are clear and specific enough to give one nightmares. In terms of its writing style, however, it's nearly childish, with phrases such as, ""The monster under her bed was real!"" to describe a victim's reaction to Sells' criminal behavior in action. The description of Sells' panic during his trial and longing for his wife's love feels like crocodile tears after the graphic descriptions of his crimes. For the investment of unpleasant detail, the writing style isn't strong enough to provide a payoff."
5,HORRIFIED,"YOU MUST HAVE A VERY STRONG STOMACH TO READ THIS BOOK. I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO READ A MURDER LIKE ON COURT TV. BUT NO........THIS MAN IS A DEMON. SO A WARNING FROM SOMEONE FAINT OF HEART. BE VERY CAREFUL IF YOU READ ABOUT THIS EVIL, EVIL MAN."
3,Not Bad,"I read a lot of true crime books and this one is middle of the road. Fanning does a good job laying out the facts and staying away from too much of the ""trouble childhood"". I would have like more build up and detail on the crimes, the hunt to catch him and less on the trial. She seems to want to fluff up the book with trial transcripts. I got the feeling that she was trying to be fair to Sells, the Rangers and the families and I just want the story. Did like the letter at the end from captain sicko and reading his rants to blame the ""Jews"". It will make it all the sweeter when the great state of Texas puts him down like a stray dog. Till then hope the inmates are treating him right....lights out Sells!"
2,Totally a page turner until Sells is apprehended.,"Through the Window is a totally engrossing account of the killing spree led by serian killer Tommy Lynn Sells. The first part of the book moves rapidly from crime to crime. The author, Diane Fanning, talently holds the attention of the reader by documenting the who, when, where, how, and what of each of the crimes Sells has confessed to having committed. This part of the book is impossible to put down.However, once Sells is arrested and his trials begin, the book crawls along at the speed of a snail. It's dull, boring, and repetitive. All the information we've already been given is rehashed over and over and over again. For this reason, I do not recommend this book."
4,Fiend of the worst kind!!!!,"Gripping read even if disturbing and shocking in parts. How is it possible that one individual escaped the detection of police for such a long length of time???!!! Unbelievable! I recommend this book to read but be prepared to feel moments of disbelief, shock and anger. Anyone that can kill children, pregnant women and entire families has to be the worst type of fiend out there.Tommy Lyn Sells, the serial killer, killed with no remorse and at times for the most trivial reasons. e.g. Being angry at someone. His reign of terror lasted many years and in various states of the USA, only everyone was oblivious to this fact, including the law.I can honestly say it is a good thing that he has been caught.....or you might not be around today reading this about him!WELL WORTH THE READ!!!!"
3,"Poorly written, topic jumper.",This book doesn't know what it wants to be or where it wants to go. It constantly jumps around to all sorts of times and directions making it rather frustrating to keep where you are at straight. You find yourself asking wait.. Weren't we just talking about (fill in blank) from (fill in year) how on earth did we get to here all of a sudden? Forcing you to backtrack in the pages to make sure you aren't crazy. I finished the book because I paid for it. I certainly wont search for any more books written by her.
4,Detailed Recount of the most Gruesome Serial Killer to Date,"Diane Fanning created an excellent account of the crimes of Tommy Lynn Sells, who killed indiscrimantely as he crisscrossed the country; from men to women, from teenagers to newborns, there was no one who was safe from falling victim to Sells and his need to kill.Be forewarned this book can, at times, be difficult to read even for the most jaded true crime reader. While at times his kill was quick and without much thought, other times his bloodlust led him to do the unthinkable; but unfortunately, only Sells was able to not only thought of it but committed it.In the latter part of the book, the rush of reading the details of his crimes because calmer as it recounts the one and only trial of Sells. While this particular section may be somewhat tedious, it does lead into an interesting area of why Sells was not ever charged nor tried for many others crimes to which he confessed.This is definetely a must read!"
5,Another hit in the Dinosaurs series,"My 3 year-old enjoys this one. As usual, there is no great plot, but a fun and silly book for your preschool set."
3,OK - not the best in the series,"We purchasedHow Do Dinosaurs Say Goodnight?and fell in love with it.Our dinosaur obsessed daughter loves it and we read it as our bedtime story at least a few times a week.We then looked into the other books in the series and bought this andHow Do Dinosaurs... Pocket Library.This book teaches your children about proper table manners. As with the other books in the series, the dinosaurs use inproper table manners most of the way through the book and then of course demonstrate perfect table manners at the end to teach your child.I do worry about the books teaching your child worse habits before improving them but I think she probably threw a lot of food on the floor before reading this too!This one doesn't appeal as much asHow Do Dinosaurs Say Goodnight?but is still a good fun book for children with dinosaurs and an attempt to teach your children better manners."
2,my twins don't like this book,"My kids loved ""How Do Dinosaurs Go to Bed?"", but they are not a bit interested in this one."
3,mISs tHOsE liVe SHowS,"HAVING THE HONOR TO HAVE A SONG WITH MY NAME IN IT (KENDALL FELL ASLEEP IN THE CORN)AND HAVING KNOWN AND WORKED WITH BILL IN OUR PREVIOUS BAND (MONKEYSPANK)I WISHED THEY WOULD HAVE LET ME RECORD THIS ALBUM.I WOULD HAVE DONE A BETTER JOB BEING AS I NEVER HEARD THEM SOUND BETTER LIVETHAN AS WHEN I USED TO MIX THEM.SIGH, GOOD DAYS INDEED"
4,My buddies,"I haven't heard this record in a while and was shocked to see it on the internet. These guys were a great live band and friends. It is a shame when the really good bands end w/o reaching their potential. At any rate, the Stress Magnets were a well rehearsed rock band that put everything into every performance and they remind of a very fun time."
2,kwaito madoda,we need free samples of kwaito.I`ve been away from the country for so long i dont even know which songs are nice.How can i buy a cd swithout knowing the songs it has?
5,classic Chuck Norris,"Happy I found it. Walker, Texas Ranger episode not included in the series sets.Love it."
3,A Complete Account,"It's obvious that Richard Plant did his research before writing this book, there's a severe lack of information on this particular topic floating around out there. As I did a report entitled ""Homosexuals in the Holocaust: The Forgotten Victims of the Third Reich,"" I found this to be the most complete book on the obscure topic. It may make for dull Sunday afternoon reading, but for all my intents and purposes, it was excellently detailed and precise."
4,Excellent gay history,"Unlike so many gay books which are just superficial or stupid, this one is real history and well written. This is harrowing reading. Plant has done us all a great service in bringing this complete account to life. Details the Nazi campaign against gay people. Those who forget history are doomed to repeat it. Don't miss it!"
2,REHASH,"A scholarly book, but most has been written before, and much better. If serious about doing research, look to other books."
5,Well done,This is a really good look at a mostly ignored piece of Holocaust history. It was well written. It is an overview and dose not go too deep into specific tortures. The topic is disturbing but not as disturbing as I thought it might be. Excellent book.
2,Not worth the time for serious scholars,"Plant's writing is, first and foremost, dry and ill-organized. He dances around subjects at random without making any points, and instead has just collected a hodge podge of information concerning Nazi persecution of homosexuals. Secondly, his research is typically not correct, and colored with an all too present bias. Plant's only qualification for having written such a book is that he was a homosexual man living in the Germany at the start of the Third Reich.While there is always merit in reading any source, I would not recommend this book to scholars with many other sources at their disposal, or those with extensive knowledge on the Third Reich. The book's facts are nothing new, and are often better phrased and organized in other works."
3,So-so analysis,"I thought this book was good, however it lacked focus. It's difficult to be critical of a book in a field of study with so little additional research. It's one of a handful of other texts on the issue of gay persecution during the holocaust.Plant's personal relation to the gay persecution certainly makes thebook emotional at times (and often hard to stomach). However, as I say, the book lacked focus. It discussed variosu circumstances and people surrounding the holocaust, but failed to make an attempt at why -- why were homosexuals, singledout along with the jews, communists, gypsies, ect...Gunter Grau's ""Hidden Holocaust"" which is a collection of primary documents does take a stab at this question. SInce its not a narrative like Plant's book its tougher to sit and read, however, it was much more concise and structed."
4,The silent holocaust,"This work is a great eye opener for those wishing to discover much of what I have come to call the 'silent holocaust'. The treatment of homosexuals by the Nazi army was harsh and cruel yet the names of the dead resound silent throughout much of history. Through this silence we can see how our society has not changed in it's compassion and cultural 'taboos' even when bigotry reaches into mass-killing of innocent peoples. Today the murder of innocent men and women for their sexuality continues as the mentality of ethnic (and thus ""moral"") superiority.This book should be read by anyone who desires to learn about this 'silent holocaust' and how to prevent history for repeating itself.Namaste and Peace to all!"
1,Not much action,"OK, we know what the Nazis thought of Jews, so woowoo, it does not take a lot of imagination to figure out what they thought about Jewish homosexuals. With a title like ""The Pink Triangle"" one would expect a lot of antidotal stories of Third Reich horror. Unfortunately you will not get that here - not even the usual pictures unidentifiable starved dead bodies stacked up all over the place.This is more of a one man's search for his long lost childhood buddy. The author was separated from a dear friend in the early 1930's and began a search for him long after WWII ended. There is some well known high level history of the era thrown in just for filler.This book is a very easy read, but if you are truly interested in the history of the era, there are a lot of far better books on the market."
1,In Concert- Dwight Yoaka,"This DVD is terrible; the picture was fuzzy, six of the eight songs are the same ones on ""Dwight Yoakam Live"". It's listed as Sept. 2008; but the concert is actually a blurry, old concert he did in 1986! I returned it for a refund."
2,"Decent book, but I was expecting more.","This is definitely a good book for a general overview on poppies. It has info on tons of different strains and species of the plant, but that's exactly where I think this book has it's weakness.This book is very much quantity over quality. The author covers many different types of poppies but doesn't give too much information on them other than a basic overview. I was hoping the book would focus on the few popular species of poppy (rhoeas, orental, somniferum, Eschscholzia, etc.) giving thorough information then dividing the various species into less detailed strain descriptions.The pictures are nice, but I wish they were with the various sections and not only in the middle pages.Overall I say this book isn't that great. I don't know of one, but there must be a better book on poppies out there."
2,nice book from a botanical point of view !!!,"plus - great for botanistsminus - how to grow, not so many images, images should have been on each page.however it is a detailed book."
2,Too hot for its own good,"This thing works very well when it's functional. But about a month after i bought it, it shorted itself out. The wires connecting the controller with the blanket and the electrical outlet are too long and too flimsy. But bigger wires would make the product even more unwieldy."
2,Can never be sure what day it is,"The photos in this calendar are gorgeous, but I really need a calendar to know what day it is. This calendar has 31 days in February, and Tuesday, May 25 is listed as a Friday. The proofreaders really screwed up on this one."
3,INS Test Prep,"I bought this book because I needed to study for the Immigration Inspector exam. Unfortunately, there isn't a book available for this exam, but this book was at least helpful. I took the test yesterday, and I was so glad that I had studied. There were 200 people taking the test, and at least I felt that I had a slight edge from studying. I wish there would have been more test exams in the book - there's only two. The Immigration Inspector test doesn't include any Spanish or Artificial Language sections, but I did use the Spanish section to brush up on my skills. It takes up to twelve weeks to get your results back, which the book doesn't mention. Good luck to all and study, study, study!!"
1,Save Your Money,"If you're considering buying this book...save your money. This book is the same as the online study guide on the Border Patrol's website. It has the same questions and the same alternative language. It does have a couple full-length practice tests. I was hoping for some insight into the actual test or some ""inside"" information that may not be outlined on the Border Patrol's website or in its' study guide. I was VERY disappointed with this purchase."
4,Dog House,"The dog house was just as described, sturdy and easy to assemble. I would recommend it to other users."
4,Our Pets Cozy Cottage Dog House,"The dog loves it. We have cold weather during the winter but with the heating pad (purchased separately) our dog stays home and comfortable; only during blizzards, do we bring her into the house."
5,Works just fine,"Snaps together and stays together. It is made from the same material that those real tough play sets for kids are made. Will last a long time. My small dog took to it, and even my large Lab decided to make it his home. I did not think he would fit, but he did. It keeps the rain off. I think the door you have to order is probably over priced, and I don't know if they work or not since I never ordered one. I would recommend this dog house."
3,not as comphy as my other shoes,its a really neat looking shoe but its not a comphy as my other skechers. but i still like them just have to wear thicker socks..lol.
5,Audiophile version worth the extra cost,"This Japanese version of Manhattan Melodies is worth the extra money over the standard version because of its impeccable sound quality - provided you have a good system. I thorougly enjoyed the music - irrespective of the sound quality,- but must admit that there is nothing adventurous going on."
4,Very good but there's still alot of room for improvement,Mr. Reed's timing is often lacking. I particularly noticed it on the Thelonious Monk cut Blues Five Spot. But who besides Monk can really sound like Monk. .... Plus his phrasing is sometimes too harsh and could benefit from a lighter and more subtle touch.I particularly liked the Letter to Betty Carter. It is a fitting tribute yet not of high enough quality as that produced by Miss Carter (a legend) herself.By and large though the album is quite enjoyable.
4,Clay Classics: God's Trombones,"This is a wonderful collection of James Weldon Johnson's poetry. I use his ""Creation"" poem as a powerful interpretation of the ""Creation"" story. This African-American poet deserves a place as one of the great poets on the American scene."
3,I hope they re-issue the Fred Waring version.,"Fred Waring did an LP of God's Trombones back in the 50s, which was really beautiful. I'll buy this version, (I'll give it a 3-star rating till I get it) but I certainly hope the Waring LP will appear on CD sometime before the Angel of death makes them obsolete!"
3,Works OK but not perfect,"I bought two of these for field service/tech work. One was DOA right out of the box. The other works okay but does not show data activity with some USB devices, for example a Lexar 2GB flash drive I use. It's better than nothing though, and the price is right. You get what you pay for."
3,"Good, not great","I was REALLY impressed with Bleach's early output (compiled in a s/t EP) but this full-length is more disappointing than engaging. It starts dragging midway through and there's even an ill-advised attempt at rapping (!) on ""Shotgun."" Oof. Still, the more engaging tracks are worth paying a few dollars for, as finding this anywhere else is nigh impossible. I still enjoy the cascading, saturated guitar tone and the post-punky vibe of the rhythm section."
4,Forgotten Gem,"Alot of people confuse this band with the american christian punk band of the same name. When infact they are an obscure 90's shoegaze band. Think Elastica meets lush. Sadly their only album, these guys remain in the shadow of their peers. If your into Dream pop/shoegaze I would totally pick this up. You can't beat the price."
2,"oh, those subtitles","I love this story and regret that those who do not speak czech have to read such poor and incomplete translation, they miss a lot. By the way I understand that this is a movie for english speaking community but when you cannot turn the subtitles off... I don't know it's stupid. My recommendation is, well, buy a czech version or german one if you have multiregional dvd player and you'll most likely get much better translation."
5,Excellent Service - Great Product,This movie arrived timely and in great shape -- as promised. I thank the merchant for his/her excellent service.
5,Even better then I remember,"I saw this on Saturday Morning Movies as a child. It became a favorite, but I hadn't seen it in decades. I love the story line. The characters are charming. It feels almost real."
