3,Mistakes in Bayes explanations,"Contains a bad mathematical mistake in section 2.2.1 on page 22.The probability P(win|sunny,good-shortstop) cannot be derived from P(win|sunny) and P(win|good-shortstop). It can take any value, even zero.Suppose, shortstop is a vampire and plays good only on cloudy weather, and on sunny weather he always leads his team to defeat. It doesn't contradict to having positive P(win|sunny) and P(win|good-shortstop)."
5,freddy,this a cool nightmare on elm street film with great 3-D special efects.freddy shows his past and begins more of his gorefest when he finds out his daugters in town.and attacks here and here friends makes more gory deaths when hes finaly dead soyrt of.this is a NOES not to be missed and dont miss the crepie sequel wes cravens new nightmare.
3,Its a good time waster.,"An Ok movie worthy of watching once. Freddys Dead had a lot of good moments like the cool death scenes and the special effects, but it also had its bad moments to. The plot was stale and the the movie was very slow, to the point of total boredom through the first 45 minutes of the film. And the ending could have been a lot better in my opinion. It does tell us a lot about Freddys past, including the bolier room death. And it even went as far as to show the Actual demon possesion of Freddy that turned him in to the horribly disfigured dream stalker that he is today. Although this movie has a lot of graphic viloence it isnt as bad as 4 and 5 but still holds its own."
2,BETTER THAN 2 OR 5 BUT THATS NOT SAYING MUCH,"This movie is ok,but its only comical and not scary at all,my mom even laughed during this DVD. I would recommend A Nightmare On Elm Street 1,3 instead and skip all the other films including this one unless you want a good laugh like I did."
2,Freddy isnt dead but the series may be!,"I know a lot of people liked this movie but it just didnt do nothing for me. The acting in this film was completely awful. They even had to throw special apearences from famous actors to keep this movie entertaining and I think they failed at that. I know freddy isnt suppose to be scary anymore but come on,they could at least have had a couple of the horror movie elements in the film. The only thing good about this film were the Death scenes although not as gory as some of the previous films were still very entertaining. The last 20 minutes of this film was so boring they had to make it in 3-D to get people to stay in the theatres and finish it. With the poor acting and the worst ending I ve ever seen in a movie I give this film only 2 stars. Rated R for a little bit of violence and language"
2,Is he dead YET?,"Freddy's moving in quick to end whatever he started by finishing off the last dream master and inheriting his daughter's powers so he can freely enter the dream realm of anyone he pleases. But he has to first get past his daughter, who has some tricks rolled up her sleeve. A vast improvement over V if somewhat hard to swallow and guest cameos from Alice Cooper and Roseanne are fun. Some great effects too."
1,O...kay....this was a waste of an hour and a half...,"I think being killed in a video game, having your head explode, and the quote ""I'll get you my pretty and your little souls to!"" sums up this movie.Save yourself the trouble and time and don't watch this movie. Please."
1,Freddy's Dead-The Final Nightmare,"Ok heres the deal, i rented this movie because i have seen every freddy movie except for this one and i love Freddy Krueger. So i pop into my dvd player expecting it to be an awesome end for freddy kruger. This is not what i get. The movie was absolutely dreadful. I don't know how someone can screw up a series like this one did."
3,FUNNY as HELL,"I loved this movie, not as a scarymovie but a funny movie. The killings are very very creative and funny. Walking on invisble stairsw and bouncing up and down like the video game Mario Brothers. I laughed the whole way during the movie. As more nightmare movies come freddy becomes more of a trickster than a killer. If you are in for a laugh this is it."
3,AN IMPROVEMENT OVER #5,"THIS ONE IS OK, IF A LITTLE UNESSECARY. IN THIS ONE, FREDDY RETURNS TO STALK A TEENAGER WHO'S LOST HIS MEMORY AND HIS SANITY WHILE TRYING TO STAY AWAKE AT ALL TIMES TO AVOID SEEING FREDDY. HOWEVER, HE IS PICKED UP BY THE COPS, AND IS SENT TO A SHELTER, AND FREDDY BEGINS PICKING MORE TARGETS THERE, ALONG THE WAY, HE ALSO FINDS HIS LONG LOST DAUGHTER [LISA ZANE]. THIS ONE HAD 3-D SCENES WHEN IT WAS RELEASED IN THEATRES, BUT THE VIDEO IS NOT, AND I'M NOT SURE IF THE DVD BOUGHT BACK THE 3-D SCENES,BUT WITH OR WITHOUT THEM, THIS MOVIE IS OK. THIS ONE HAS CAMEOS BY ROSEANNE, JOHNNY DEPP, ALICE COPPER, AND TOM ARNOLD [I THINK]. WHILE THIS MOVIE IS FAR FROM BEING ONE OF THE BEST NIGHTMARE MOVIES, IT DEFINITELY TOPS #5 110 PERCENT."
2,Freddy seems to Friendly,I like almost all the NOES movies but this one seems too.......funny. I was laughing more than I was jumping from surprise or something. I reall wouldn't watch this movie no matter how u want to see it because u will be very dissapointed. The only really cool thing was when u see Freddy as the dad in the garden and all. Do yourself a favor and watch all the NOES movies but this one. Later
5,A Nightmare On Elm Street 6: Freddy's Dead The Finale Nightmare,This movie is awesome. i don't know why people don't like this i thought it was better than some of the others. i loved the story and of course robert englund coming back as freddy. this is a great movie. i love these movies. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
2,Limited Deppth,"Was it worth sitting through this 1991 addition to the ""Elm Street"" franchise for a 16-second PSA (""This is your brain..."") featuring Johnny Depp billed as Oprah Noodlemantra? Probably not. But the film was much more layered and complex than the first one. Better effects, too."
3,One of the weakest Freddy flicks...,"...But hey, at least it's not as bad as ""Freddy's Revenge"". It does have its moments but on the whole, it just falls flat and ends up being one of my least favorite Nightmares. Quite honestly, I can only reccomend this to you if you're already a Freddy fan or if you're a completist and you're buying this to fill in the gap in your collection. All-in-all a pretty mediocre movie, even for a sequel.3 stars/5"
1,The WORST Freddy movie,"I remember liking this movie when it came out in high school. How times change. I watched it on video and it's sooooo bad. Lisa Zane is the WORST actress I've seen in any movie...let alone horror. The ""freddy video game"" is extrememly bad and made me want to puke. Can you imagine that scene in the fist Elm Street?? Freddy's Dead may have been a good idea on paper, but it just didn't even come close to being a good movie on screen. The FX was bad too. The freddy head explosion at the end was straight out of a cartoon. The 3-D was really subpar. The idea of putting 3-D glasses on to see into Freddy's head is a good idea...if you're into Power Rangers."
2,The Original Is always The Best Nevermind Remakes.,"Too Cartoonish Indeed,To me part 1-5,(with 1 of course being the very best),2 being good,and 5 downright silly.represents the height of the freddy franchise. Wes Craven's New Nightmare was also good, If your like me who grew up on this franchise watching On WBFS-33, or wdzl-39(the most) then NO REMAKE w/o Englund will due."
2,FREDDY'S DEAD!?? IF ONLY IT WERE TRUE!,"I am reviewing the entire Nightmare on Elm Street series, but not this DVD release. I own the box set and I wanted to do individual reviews for each film.OK, sometimes during a long run of horror franchises, the train derails! This is the case with Freddy's Dead The Final Nightmare. The 3-D gimmick for the last 10 minutes are pretty cool, but not enough to save this so-so entry in the series. The DVD transfer looks good and the 3-D sequence is pretty good for old school 3-D!"
1,The worst NOES film. Period.,"It was the worst installment to me. I am a Freddy fan, but I did not like this one, it only had like 3 kills and it was boring. I did enjoy the video game scene, that was the most interesting part of the movie."
2,"ok, for the money","The movie has too many cameo's or how ever it is spelled, I dont like this Freddy or the second Movie the rest our good though."
1,I have not seen this movie but heard it bit.,Freddy Kruger looked nothing like himself and it was just......Bad! It was just terrible.
4,Freddy's done it again!,This movie was great. Robert Englund was holarious. The graphics and special effects were great. I thought there could been more body count though. It was a great combination of horror and comedy. I think you should see it.
2,fine,this movie is good for one reason because it gives a review of freddy's life. but the plot otherwise is bad and the acting(with the exception of Englund) is bad and freddy is to much of a comic in this movie. it doesn't really connect with other movies that well either.
2,Definitely the worst of the series,"Freddy's Dead, I'm afraid, is a total bore. Poorly written, poorly made, no interest at all. Skip this bad movie and go straight to the excellent Wes Craven's New Nightmare.Here's the lowdown on the Nightmare series: The first and last movies are great (the only two that were written and directed by Wes Craven. Go figure.), the 2nd and 6th were awful, and the middle three are pretty good. Nightmare 3, 4 and 5 are not great movies, but enjoyable as horror/comedies with great special effects. The original Nightmare on Elm Street and Wes Craven's New Nightmare are the ones that should not be missed."
3,The Funniest Freddy Film Ever!,"This is my second favourite 'Nightmare' film. It has so many funny jokes, coming from Freddy. The special effects are really cool, too. It looks like visions....If you like Freddy because, he's funny and not scary. Then you're going to like this one. This is the funniest Freddy yet."
2,Very bad,"I did not like this movie at all.The only good thing about it is it's in 3D,Freddy finaly dies,and all the way at the end where they show clips from parts 1-5. That's It."
2,Not that great of a sequel,"the worst film in the series, but good for laughs. freddy is too comical with rediculous killings, out of the blue family member, and subpar ending"
2,This movie stunk!!!!!!!!,"After watching this film,I wasn't sure if I just watched a horror movie or a comedy. Krueger had a stupid joke for everything he did. A good horror film must be gruesome, and suspensful to make it good.This had none of these qualities. If you are looking for a good horror film get Friday the 13th. If you want an unscary, not funny piece of crap, get Freddy's dead."
1,It stank !,"I thought this movie sucked really, really bad. This movie will NEVER see better days. I will admit the FX's were all right for what they were, but they weren't all that. But come on people. If Freddy were ture evil he could never die.And the only reason I rated it a one is becouse there were no negative numbers."
2,Not one of Freddy's better nightmares,"Well let's see the series had it's great moments (1 and 3).But this installment of the Nightmare films is too much like part 4.Well it's like part 4 in that it could have been good.It had a great opening and the middle of the film set in Springwood payed off good showing how Kruger had damned the adults.But after John Doe's death,the film feel through.The ""3-D"" ending was too much of a gimmick to sell tickets.Dont see this film.See 1, 3 and 7."
2,ok,"this one is better than the 2nd movie, and about even with the 5th, but isn't that good of a movie if you have seen the other movie of this series"
1,It was a really bad movie.,It wa jjhjhgj;lgkkkkhlkjgpouyijoikjjihioyuoiytiouyitoyitoyityoitruyoituytoihuyjitohjoituytioyuitoryuityuotiyhituyoituyiotuytoiryuti8ew9tiwoetiuiewortuoiuwoiuiueeoioitupwetoiue86tu8rti0rugiojuieo68958ut8igourioutiuter...displayed in yugoslavian
2,Not as good as cold be,"The way they portrayed Freddy with his mask was just no good. At the time it came out there should have been better effects and costumes though out the movie, overall disappointing but you should still see it if you are a die hard Elm Street fan."
1,0 STARS: AWFUL!!,"""Freddy's Dead- The Final Nightmare"" is a terrible installment to what was a great horror movie series. This movie is a total joke just like the previous two sequels before it...this garbage, a horror movie?? Give me a break!! This movie is not scary...it's ridiculous!! I highly recommend sticking with parts 1-3, which are undoubtedly the only ""NOES"" movies that should have ever been made. This movie sucks...shame on the people that made this trash."
3,Not Like The Original But Far Better Than Some Of Them!!!!,Freddy did not look like himself and it was more of a comedy than a horror.Freddy has always had some sexual thing about him that makes me cringe! This movie was far worse than the original but a vast improvement to some of the other ones!
2,Nice,"This movie had a great idea behind it. However, it was poorly written, directed, and acted, which was its downfall. It seemed more like a video game than an actual Movie. Futhermore, the chillful atmosphere that was in nightmare on elm street 1, 2, 3, and 5, are completely gone and is more of a way for people to make money than to actually make a good movie."
2,"Nightmare on Elm St., part 6..","first let me say I'm a big horror fan. The ""Nightmare"" series is one of my favorites. I thought the first 3 films in the series were well done (for a horror film), especially the first two.here we have with this film part 6, and the ""bloom is off the rose"" at this point. I agree with another reviewer who stated that this film feels too ""cartoonish"", with too many computer effects and CGI. Instead of Freddy being a terror, he wise-cracks and is ""jokey"" too much in the film. Just not scary.the script is thread-bare at this point in the series. I couldn't really make heads or tails of it. From what I could discern, Freddy had a daughter, and in this film she is a psychologist for at-risk youth in a group home. One of the teens is having Freddy-nightmares, and so is she. She, along with the teen, investigates the town of Springfield, Ohio to find clues in order to defeat Freddy.* pass on this one *"
2,3-D Sequences barely save this sub-par finish to the series,To fully appreciate this film you have to either seen it in the theater or have a DVD player. The 3D sequence is the film's saving glory. The film seems like it was rushed because the script is bland. I think if the film had brought back Wes Craven then maybe it would've been a superior finish to one of the greatest film series in history.
2,Wow! What a waste of Talent!,"I rented this last week, under the mistaken impression it was the very last in the series. But I forgot the rule with these enless sequel movies; Final is never the last one.So I ended up watching this stinker. Wow! It doesn't get much worse than this.You may wonder why I even gave it two stars. The main reason is because the writers seemed to put some effort in making it comical. At least it had that going for it. But the thing was: it wasn't that funny.Okay, I'm a hardcore videogamer, so I got the ""Now I'm playing with Power."" one liner from Freddy, even 14 years after Nintendo used this marketing pitch. So I did laugh at it. But I bet I would have rolled my eyes, if I had seen it 14 years ago.I say this one barely squeeked by a 1 star review.MC White said: It stunk!"
4,"Sanus Media Tower, cherry color","I was looking for a good looking, flexible, rotating media tower, to fit in a narrow space. This certainly fits the bill. The glass shelves can be put in just about any position, and I have CDs, DVDs, and VHS tapes (both normal & disney size) in it. The flexibility is nice, and I have a couple shelves left over. The parts all fit together quite well, assembly took maybe 20 minutes. The 2-sided design is nice, since it can be rotated such that only the wood sides show. The other primary reason I went with Sanus was due to its construction from real maple. Here was the only disappointment. While the sides do have real maple veneer, it is veneer over particle board, not solid maple, and the top & bottom are simply particle board. Overall, I'm still pleased, just wish it was solid maple."
5,Reencuentros,"Este es un disco de rencuentros y nuevas emociones. Rencuentros con el genio que nos enamoro con sus poesias y liricas hace mas de 20 anios. Nuevas emociones al descubrir que nuestros dias pueden seguir llenandose de flores al escuchar su musica. Silvio reaparece con sus ideales claros y comprometidos en un mundo cada vez mas confuso y abatido. Resulta un goce tener este disco en las manos y saber que incluso hoy existe esperanza siempre y cuando ""seamos un tilin mejores y mucho menos egoistas""..."
1,Research adventures for young scientists,This book could not be found in the public Libraries because of the old cc: date.I was very please to find it. I needed it for my granddaughters science project.It was in real good condition and the price was very cheap. I knew the project that was in the book because my daughter did the project years ago. I couldn't fine this project in any other book. I was very well pleased.
2,Bit biased,"Falls short of the mark in answering the question of Bambi's guilt or innocence, and at times is a bit too biased towards Bambenek. Pretty typical tv-movie fare. Another stepping stone in the long and uninteresting resume of Linda Blair after she stopped appearing topless in movies."
4,great book,"A great childrens' polio book. It taught me about polio,something I didn't know anything about. The book had a message about not discriminating against people who had polio. The book shows us how to find out about the disease so that we don't hurt people's feelings. I think the author should write a similar book about AIDS. Tim"
2,Disappointing!,"Only a person who lived through the polio years could relate to this story. Today's children need more background to understand the reasons for the fear, the method of polio transmission, and the references to ""commies."" As a polio survivor, I had hoped that this book would tell a more informative and compelling story. Instead, the book raises more questions than it answers. I found it disappointing."
2,WILL MY CHILDREN READ THIS ?,"THIS BOOK IS FULL OF FEAR. WHY SCARE MY CHILD WITH SOMETHING IF IT IS NOT NECESSARY ? I LIKE THE STORY AND HOW THE AUTHOR TOUCHED ON SEVERAL DIFFERNT SUBJECTS. I THINK TO DO THIS STORY JUSTICE, THE BOOK NEEDED TO BE LONGER. THIS IS THE FIRST CHILDREN'S BOOK I HAVE SEEN ABOUT POLIO. KEEP THEM COMING."
2,Title may be decieving,"This book is a general networking book which so happens to deal with ERP systems. There are better books for networking available, but if you are already skilled in ERP systems and want to understand the network requirements this may be the book for you!"
3,Interesting Information,"Filled with information, somewhat repetitive, but liked much better than Vol 1. Gives many exercises and explanations. Would recommend to others."
5,An introduction to five major religious traditions of the world,"Five Voices Five Faiths: An Interfaith Primer is an introduction to five major religious traditions of the world for lay readers, as presented by five practitioners of each religion. A different faithful individual speaks for Hinduism, Judaism, Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam, providing a plain-terms summary of the basic tenets of each followed an intriguing interview that tests how the ideals of each faith co-exist (or conflict) with one another. Ultimately a tribute to both the differences and the common bonds between faiths, Five Voices Five Faiths is deeply reverent, respectful, and spiritual, and an excellent beginners guide to analysis, comparison, and contrast between religious ideals."
4,"Excellent information, albeit brief!!","Concise (sometimes painfully so) overview of the faiths covered. We used this book for a ""Religions of the World"" group held at my church. It was a good ""starting point"". It generated much discussion, and raised many questions for which we sought answers from other sources. Just a note...for the buddhism session we used a book by the title of ""Living Buddha, Living Christ"" (by Thich Naht Hanh)which was excellent."
2,Print out the source code yourself and read it.,"I am disappointed in the actual code commentary, it does NOT do a good job of explaining the code. Most of the time the commentary does nothing more than tell you what a function does - and it is obvious from the name anyway. Apache has a lot of standard programming conventions and internal libraries. I think those should have been covered first and in depth. It would make the Apache source code much more understandable. I read through the first chapter or so of Linux Core Commentary and it seems much more well written."
4,Soft. Seductive. Introspective. Great fun.,"A marvelous compilation of the best pleasures of life. At times it made me feel guilty for enjoying myself so much. Holland's premise that we are loosing sight of simple, wholly self indulgent pleasure, hits the nail on the head. I found things I do and others I am certain to try. She missed my favorite of all, "" the sun nap"". My family thinks I'm part lizard and part cat. I can't seem to get past a good sunbeam without stopping for a quick solar charge"
1,wrong title,"This book should be retitled ""Writing a book for dummies"". It concentrates WAY too much on creating a story and writer's block. If you already know how to write a decent story you're not going to like this book. It doesn't get in2 screenwriting until Chapter 15, and there are only TWO pages of screenwriting format. I was expecting at least a chapter of format, considering the title. False advertising. I'd look into other books."
3,"A smooth, decent guide","If you're just starting out, this is a decent guide. There are other books which cover the basics likeThe Bare Bones Book of Screenwritingthat are more simple, clear and precise. Overall Screenwriting for Dummies does its job."
3,Not bad ...,Could have been better. I found it lacking. Trottier's book has been of more value to me.
4,A good book to have.,I liked it very much. It is a big help to me. The book is laid out well especially for beginners.
2,A lot of academic theory but nothing practical.,"First, I would like to make clear, or to put it more aptly, this book was written by an academic and not someone who is in the actual business. In other words, lots of theory but nothing practical to back it up. If I'm not mistaken, the author has never, ever actually written a screenplay and have it produced.Those are strikes one and two against this book. Strike three is that, yes there is some valuable information contained between the covers but it's SO disjointed, you have to constantly go back and forth throughout it in order to try to make any sense out it. My advice? Buy something written by people who ARE in the movie business and NOT from the ""Joe College"" types who live off of tenure so they really don't have to prove anything to anyone. It's one thing to talk about writing and quite another to sell something for a six figure amount to a production company."
4,"Good to read, you will not waste time.","This was my second book about screenwriting. thats mean I had a good background of screenwriting when i decided to buy and read it.For starters this is an excellent book to know every detail. some informations repeated in other chapters but u can skip if u understood them.Too detailed and direct too! just as the title said.the most thing i liked in this book is the ""Formatting a Screenply"". the book well organized.the only thing i didn't like is some informations repeated in other chapters.if this is the style of for dummies series, you can ignore my words about repeating."
2,hodgepodge,A disjointed reference book made by an educated person. Lots of general advice that has no flow. 30/60/30. blah blah.
2,Same ol' song and dance,"A friend of mine bought this book and shouldn't have. Laura Schellhardt isn't a seasoned pro at screenwriting, she is a TEACHER. Not a good one at that.Yes, the book is informative, but it doesn't say anything different that any other book does, other than the Screenwriter's Bible by David Trottier. Trottier is a professional writer with numerous credits under his belt. So my advice is to ""Schell"" out an extra dollar so you can buy the Screenwriter's Bible and just leave Screenwriting for Dummies alone."
5,Much-needed addition to the debate,"There is so much uncertainty involved with environmental issues that taking a definitive stance is dangerous. So far the media have been overwhelmed with input from only one side, doomsayers and extreme environmentalists, while big business generally dismisses the whole thing by casting is as jobs versus the environment.The author here points out that a lot of data being used is just plain bad and therefore, the world isn't in such a bad shape after all. It ain't over, but his is a good contribution."
1,The Skeptical Environmentalist,"I had to critique a chapter of this book for a class for a module in a postgraduate GeoSciences course at Edinburgh University, Scotland. I chose the chapter on forests. It was not a difficult assignment. It was riddled with inaccuracies, exaggerations, avoidance of key issues, and, I am sad to say, plain lies. Lomborg uses data which is clearly not supposed to be used for the purpose he uses, mis-quotes people, aggregates data sets which aren't meant to go together, all to enable him to present the image he wants to portray. Personally, I can only comment on the chapter on forests, but after talking to my fellow classmates, it is clear he has done the same for the other chapters we were asked to critique. I can only assume he wants create a media frenzy which will push his book sales.Please email me if you want to read my essay critique of the chapter on forests.Thanks,Joseph Gair"
4,SA Censorship,"Several reviewers have commented on Bjorn's lack of response to his critics. Apparently, Bjorn wrote a paragraph by paragraph refutation of the 10 pages of space the SA devoted to his critics and posted it on his website. Scientific American sent him an injuction to take down his refutation on the ground that it was ""violation of copyright"". You can read his refutation of his critics [at his website].What is most interesting about the 'experts' attacks is that they do not debate him on the merits or the facts - instead they engage in personal attacks and appeals to authority -- he isn't an 'expert' in enviornmental affairs, etc. Funny. I thought science relied on demonstratable facts and methodologies.I suppose there is a lot of grant money at stake here. -- At least that's the only reason I can think of why the SA would be acting like this. The book is fairly interesting, but the muck it has dredged to the surface is infinitely more so."
1,The methods of denial are endless,"Here is the real Litany that Lomborg endorses, the sacred Litany that most of us in the privileged world live by:1. Humans are the only beings that really matter on this earth.2. Western civilization is the model for the rest of the world; after all, we are the pinnacle of evolution.3. Resources are infinite and economic growth is infinite.4. Technology will save us.Lomborg is blinded by the same cultural ideology that got us in this mess in the first place. The Skeptical Environmentalist is the same old rhetoric (Litany) cloaked in scholarship and statistics. He wants us to believe The System would work just fine if the pesky Chicken Little environmentalists would just stop frightening people with their lies and exaggerations.Don't waste your money unless you want to hear a Litany of cop outs that are made to justify our destructive behavior."
1,Scientific Dishonesty,"Potential readers should be aware that, according to a recent New York Times article, the Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty issued a report calling Lomborg's book an example of ""systematic one-sidedness"" and that ""the publication of the work under consideration is deemed to fall within the concept of scientific dishonesty,"" as defined by Danish rules for scientific integrity. Based on his book, he got a job analyzing economic impacts of environmental regulations in Denmark. A classic example of the fox guarding the henhouse."
1,Skeptical about The Skeptical Environmentalist,"The book is badly flawed.It is selective, ignoring, for example, undeniable coral reef degradation, which is caused by a mix of human (e.g., pollution run off, dynamite and cyanide fishing, anchor damage) and natural (e.g., El Nino) causes.It contains self-contradictions, perhaps due to different students doing the research for different chapters (e.g., page 96 ""The population is growing more and more slowly"" whereas page 46 [Fig. 11] shows population growth on the steepest part of the population versus date curve....I wish I could rate it zero stars."
5,Sabotaged,"One can argue statistics, but Lomborg's basic thesis -- that even if global warming is real, intervention on the scale proposed diverts time and resources away from more pressing priorities, like treating malaria, HIV/AIDS and starvation -- has merit. One may debate Lomborg, but he's not deserving of the shrill, dogmatic and malign attacks by the one-star crowd, who by lowering the average score seek to sabotage book sales and thus suppress the thesis. As a charming one-star reviewer says, ""The only possible use for this book today would be for kindling campfires."" Hitler couldn't have put it better.Of course, if suppression of book sales is indeed the one-stars' intent, then they have failed. This book came out first in 2001 and it's still being hotly debated...and read."
1,Bullpuckey,"This book is bullpuckey. Lomborg supported this book with shoddy statistics. This book has thoroughly discredited by a panel of specialist scientists. Some of these statements have been published in magazines such as Scientific American. He uses out of date statistics, irrelevant statistics, doublespeak, biased statistics and scelectively unrepresentative statistics to support his claims."
1,"Some good findings, awful recommendations","This book has been highly influential. It does not question the fundamental behind climate change. Interestingly tho, it advocates that we leave climate change alone given the huge cost of solving the problem. Bjorn recommends that efforts are instead focused on aid to places like Africa. He rightly claims that these issues can be dealt with less money. This does however ignore the fact that climate change will damage Africa by providing it with additional drought, heat and extreme weather conditions. A recent UK commons select committee report for example(HM Government, 2005) www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/environmental_audit_committee.cfm.suggests that our Africa efforts will be made obsolete by the effects of climate change. Bjion points out that Kyoto does not do enough to avoid climate change. I agree with this finding but believe that the recommendation should be to take a tougher line. To avoid the problem would be the wrong solution."
1,Misinformation About the State of the World,"Lomborg has no basis for the arguments he presents. Do not let the title of his work trick you- this analysis of the environment is actually false and puts pollution and the degrading state of our planet on the back burner to technology and economical interests. The ""facts"" that he uses are based on sketchy research done by scientists ""sponsored"" (ie: paid off) by large, polluting companies. This book should be taken with a grain of salt and not used by those who wish to destroy our environment as evidence because in fact it is not an accurate assessment. If there is anything to be skeptical about, it is Mr. Lomborg and the information he presents in his book."
1,Don't waste your money or time,"I have a hard time believing that anyone looking at the hard facts facing environmental issues today could write a book like this. The conclusions that Bjorn draws seem to indicate that his research was funded by corporations with vested interest in maintaining the status quo -- the perilous path where short-term profiteering and exploitation outweigh the long-term risks.Extremely disappointing. There are many other books out there that paint a more accurate, realistic picture of our true situation and give thoughts on how to re-stabilize our co-existence with our planet."
1,Pseudo-science,"Lomborg's book may appear to consist of logical arguments, and therefore appeals to many, but closer examination reveals this not to be the case.I would urge other readers of the book to treat Lomborg's work with the same view to skepticism as Lomborg himself..."
4,Prioritization,"I have not come across any criticisms on this book which dispute any of the facts or methodologies used by Lomborg. Instead, they are driven by emotion. The mentality of the people who do not like this book is that all animals must be saved, we cannot tolerate any deaths due to pesticides, we must vastly reduce carbon dioxide emissions, etc.The primary point of the book is that we do not have infinite wealth, so we need to prioritize our spending so it has the greatest positive impact for the planet and human population. The only way to do this is to have a clear understanding of which problems are most important, so we can prioritize our spending on those issues.To those who say that every environmental problem is important, I doubt that you would put your money (unbearably higher taxes and higher prices for everything else you enjoy) where your mouth is."
5,A Must Read,"When I read some of the harsh and the scornful criticisms of Lomborg's ""The Skeptical Environmentalist,"" I knew that his work was important. I rushed to order the book and I haven't been disappointed. I would highly recommend it. It exposes a myriad of highly questionable ideas, lavished in the framework of `statistical science,' as essentially, incoherent.The `environmentalist movement' which finds its breeding ground within the comfort zone of this hyped-up `science,' has evolved into a slick cadre of lobbyists and lawyers, who are responsible for the enormous hidden tax on American products and services [money]in 2000). This movement makes false and dishonest statements, ignores contradictory evidence and is deliberately alarmist. It represents an attempt to manipulate public opinion by exploiting fear and ignorance. Lomborg (who is a former member of this movement) has written an excellent response to the environmentalist hype.This book is a must read!"
5,Truth Will Out,"Mr. Lomborg, a Danish professor and Greenpeace member, started his project with his students to disprove conservative complaints about the environmental movement. To his surprise he discovered and proves in this book(almost half of which is devoted to footnotes and sources) the conservatives complaints are largely true. He not only makes a case for the improving environment he gives example after example of lies by prominent environmental movement leaders and cites you to charts and accepted studies that disprove them. This is a must read book for anyone serious about the environment. It is a more significant environmental work than ""The Silent Spring"" and it's based on fact not emotion."
4,Not for the easily bored.,"The title for this review seems odd considering the 4 star rating I gave the volume. However both fit well.This is a book of stats. It is a VERY LONG book of stats. It is a very long DETAILED book of stats. It is a very long METICULOUSLY FOOTNOTED detailed book of stats. It is a very long meticulously footnoted detailed book of stats WRITTEN IN THE LANGUAGE OF A STATISTICIAN.I have ofter called books dry, this one not only takes the cake, it adds a side of ice cream and finishes it as a midnight snack before your weight trainer can spot you.Now if you can get by that you will find it informative and interesting. It is better used as a reference guide than as a sit down read.A more interesting story is the banishment from the left of the Author, but this book is the cause of that story not the story itself."
3,Lomborg the patron saint of industrialists or...,"This book is neither wrong or right it as to be checked not by non-specialist like us but by specialists. There is problem in that. Why do economists, liberals, conservatives, industrialist, without ever listening to ecologists, enviromentalists or basically people who know climate, environment best, listen to Lomborg who is a statistician(and then make him th prophet) . That does not make him a bad scientists but it does not make him an authority by a book like this. And don't let this book be an industrialists holy book. It is not. Only thing that humanity does not need is dogmatism. But at least this book has created a consciousness(or increased it) about the decisions humanity has to make for survival of itself and living things around us."
1,The Irony,"The author takes one side of complex issues that have decades worth of science (from global warming to extinction rates) and 'analyzes' them via statistics. You know the old saying about lying with statistics? Lomborg has done a fine job of that! FYI, the Danish Research Advisory just condemed this book and its author for scientific dishonesty."
1,Ill-informed and biased,"Lomborg is not a natural scientist of any kind. His work, while feted by anti-environmentalist lobby groups, has been criticised by a number of leading journals - see, for example, the April 2002 Scientific American, available online - and is currently under investigation for academic misconduct. This book is worse than worthless."
2,Skeptical about The Skeptical Environmentalist,"The Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty issued a decision that declared Lomborg's research ""to fall within the concept of scientific dishonesty,"" and to be ""clearly contrary to the standards of good scientific practice.The man is statictian with an adgenda- to say that the enviroment is actually not as bad off as it is. The one good thing that came from this book are the debates that followed. Scientific American and Grist Magazine are both good sources of rebuttal.Read this book, but as with every book, read carefully."
1,Yet another propagandist for corporate destructiveness,"If I could give this less than one star, I would do it. It is a terribly written and even more terribly researched book. Yet it will continue to draw attention, and to sell, because it serves the purposes of corporate power. Julian Simon, Gregg Easterbrook, Alston Chase. Bjorn Lomborg is just the latest in a long line of those who make careers out of misusing quotes and statistics in order to serve those in power. If any environmentalist did such poor research as this, their reputation would be ruined. It reveals much about the destructiveness of our culture, and our deep state of denial about this destructiveness, that Lomborg has already been able to parlay his nonsense into a government job and an international bestseller."
1,the Mein Kampf of nature haters,"Thia book is a shame to humanity, I am sure financed by the extreme right wing, logging interests and trappers, their game of numbers to justify cruelty is childish and has no science to it. The book is a pure attack against caring for the planet and an insult to life, if there was ever one book that deserved to be burned this is the one. Only for ignorant people who base their opinions in the latest hunting magazines, there was no intelligence needed to read it and there was no intelligence needed to write it, but if you are a catle rancher and nazi you might find it useful to impress your truck riding friends you have some knowledge of the scientifical justification to destroy the planet for fun ."
1,terrible,"as is shown (with real facts) in articles by reputed scientists in articles in scientific american, grist magazine and other publications, many of lomborg's facts are just plain wrong!he uses words like unlikely, not plausible etc to back up his claims without giving any real statistics. strange, especially for a statistition."
5,Probably the most important public-affairs book this year,"Whether you agree with Lomborg's analysis or not, this bookhas opened up the debate about what is wrong (and right) aboutpublic policies concerning the environment.No longer will the mandarins be able to sit back in their ivory towers and tell the rest of us what we ought to do without providing detailed analysis and policy arguments. On the other side of thing, no longer will people like me be able to pretend that (some) changes are not needed.Lomborg has provided us with a ractual framework upon to base the public debate. No matter that he may be wrong on various factual points: his opponents will have to make their countercases on Lomborg's framework."
3,"Good Book, gives different side of old debate","The book tries to present a side not often heard in this debate. One should read it to judge for themselves. This issue is so close to some, all you see here are either 5 star reviews or 1 star reviews. As some here wish to cite the NY Times and this Danish agency's rebuking of the author. Remember, majority scientific consensus does not always equate into truth. At one point in history, the majority of scientists felt they had undeniable proof the world was flat and the Earth was it's center, and those that opposed this view were not treated very well to say the least! Let's not walk the same road again of idea stifling, no matter how ridiculous you believe another's ideas are."
4,"Energy chapter useful, but misses the mark","Bjorn Lomborg makes some very good points about energy sources. His use of statistics is impressive, but in taking a big-picture viewpoint, he misses some critical details. One would believe, for example, that oil shale could be a saviour if conventional oil were to increase in price, whereas, most experts predict that oil shale is likely to be no more than a niche supply, at best. His discussion on oil is misleading, and he neglects to include important statistics on discoveries and exploration. There are complex debates about a wide range of issues in energy generation, and these are simply not mentioned. His conclusion that ""energy is not running out"" tends to skew the valuable information he provides. While he complains of ""the litany"", he could also be guilty of being too optimistic. In summary, a worthwhile read, but by no means the final word."
1,The Skeptical Environmentalist,"This book is a sorry excuse for science or criticism based on science. While being skeptical about environmental issues is probably a good idea, this is not the book where you will find reasonable arguments on both sides. Lomborg picks his data to support predetermined conclusions, not the other way around. He often chooses to cite studies or reports that are over 30 years old while ignoring or downplaying more current information. The data he presents are often superficial and misleading. He makes no attempt to help the reader see the data in context - yet that is what rational skepticism is all about. In each chapter he concludes by saying nothing serious is really wrong. So if you want a book that says, ""Don't worry - be happy,"" lull yourself to sleep with this one. But if you want to take a look at why you might be skeptical about the claims of some environmentalists, then find a book by someone who can differentiate between being critical and being Pollyanna."
1,Misleading and dangerous,"A non-scientist writes a book with no peer review, and comes to indefensible and essentially reactionary, unsupportable conclusions, probably in the service of an ideological agenda. His conclusions -- that the major environmental problems of today, from global warming to fisheries depletion to species loss, and on and on, are not really problems at all -- are contradicted by most all responsible scientists. Unfortunately this book has made a big splash, and does little other than misinform and obfuscate the real issues."
4,I have read it all,"Yes, I have read the entire book. It's about time someone has emerged to tell the tree huggers to be more thorough in their work. What is already bad science is abused further by pontificators who will say virtually anything to exite the media."
4,Talking points memo.,"It is evident from the review by the reader below that he or she has gotten a copy of the talking points handed out by environmentalist organizations to try to smear Lomborg. Not even bothering to paraphrase this list, the reviewer simply presents it to us verbatim, while providing nothing in the way of evidence to back up the statements. The fact is that ideological environmentalists like this one are running into a wall. The simple truth is that their dire predictions are failing utterly to come true. Lomborg does a fabulous job of exposing the dichotomy between environmentalist rhetoric and the actual state of the world. I recommend the book highly."
4,The Economist 1/11/2003,"The Economist reviewed this book on the above noted date and mentioned the findings from Denmarks Committee on Scientific Dishonesty: and I quote""How Odd? Why, in the first place is a panel with a name such as this investigating complaints against a book which makes no claim to be a scientific treatise?"" Since the book was not conducting scientific research, what business is it of a panel concerned with scientific dishonesty?. One might expect to find the answers to this question in the arguments and data supporting the ruling-but there are none. Etc. Read the review it is enlightening."
1,Very misleading and shallow,"So many people will believe anything they read if it agrees with their beliefs. This book contains errors and distortions. Unfortunately, the reviewers just add to the confusion. For example:""...government workers faked lynx presence..."" Sorry, it didn't happen. Read the follow-ups, not just the first headline. Visit the Audubon Magazine website for a comprehensive article on the incident.The marine harvest data is flawed. China has been lying about their catches for years. Even the not very left-leaning U.S. News reported that yields have been dropping dramatically. ""Marine sleuths find that faulty numbers from Beijing have masked a worldwide drop in catches"".This book is recommended for the person who wants to refute arguments about environmental problems and doesn't care about accuracy and facts."
1,Outdated and Uneducated,An environmental book written by a statistician! 90% of all statistics can be used to show either side of the argument 50% of the time! This author uses this skill liberally.The first chapter makes a very valid point: be aware of what you're reading and be skeptical! The rest of the book is slanted toward his OPINION and he disregards information that doesn't support his viewpoints.Many things may not be as bad as some portray but they aren't as rosy as this author portrays either. READ WITH SKEPTICISM!!
1,A Smokescreen,"This book is based on a tenditious and self-serving interpretation of the existing data. Worst yet, the author provides a scientific smokescreen for those economic and political interests which are blocking any effective effort to address the single greatest threat to humanity and this planet, climate change. For an accurate understanding of the political and economic forces arrayed against appropriate environmental policies I recommend Matthew Cahn's _Environmental Deceptions_ and George Gonzalez's _Corporate Power and the Environment_."
1,Completely Inaccurate,"Not only does this book contain piles of completely incorrect ""facts"" and statistics, but it wildly distorts the actual facts it presents. It has widely been mocked in the scientific and intellectual communities (see, for a layman's example Scientific American issues of January and May 2002). Anyone who wants a clear and unbiased version of the facts will unforuntately not receive it from this horrible book."
1,DANEROUS GREENWASH,"STASTICS DOES NOT EXPLAIN ALL LIFEthe author has no qualifications in the subject area.those who deny environmental damage have been shown up to be cooperative workers for their industry funders.the well respected journal THE ECOLOGIST gave this book a very brief review stating that it had no foundation at all ,listed the web site of the environmental studies facaulty at the author's university,and stated that they had no intention of giving it any more publicity as it deserved none.this book is dangerous and there is no need to reward the unqualified writer by reading or buying it."
1,Author is out of his element,""" Limited credentials.Bjrn Lomborg is an Associate Professor of Statistics in the Department of Political Science, University of Aarhus, Denmark.His prior publications are in game theory and computer simulations. He has no professional training -- and has done no professional research -- in ecology, climate science, resource economics, environmental policy, or other fields covered by his new book. Lomborg says the book grew out of a class project for his students.The author has every right to venture into new territory and express his personal views, but equally his audience has the right to question the authority of his judgments.""-World Resorces Institute"

4,HOT AND ACTION FILLED,I LOVED THIS VIDEO. IT IS A ONE OF A KIND....WE WATCHED THIS VIDEO TOGETHER. HOPEFULLY NEXT TIME IT WILL BE A LITTLE LONGER! JUST COULDN'T GET ENOUGH. GOTTA LOVE IT !!!
3,ORIGINAL PLAYERS,WHAT UP TO ALL WHODI IN SOUTH EAST AND MY HOMIE TOWN MIDWEST I JUST GOT THIS VIDEO LAST WEEK AND I OFF THE HOOK DAVE HOLLISTER IS EAT PUSSY IN THIS FILM AND IT HAS ALL THAT HARDCORE GIRLS GET ON EACH OTHER AND THE MOVIE HAS TRAIN AND TRICK DADDY AND THREE 6 MAFIA AND 95 SOUTH GET HARDCORE WITH ALL THE REAL PLAYERS AND PIMPZ WITH MOVIE STAR HEATHER HUNTER. GO GET VIDEO FOR ALL THE REAL MACK AND PLAYERS!
1,Very poor picture and sound,"Warning!this is the laserlight version and is cheaply made with very poor sound and a very poor picture.It certainly is NOT ""mastered from the best available sources"".In fact this version is shorter than the other available one,suggesting that the print it was copied from must have been cut due to a degraded print.The ""introductions"" by Tony Curtis to the laserlight copies look as if they were all filmed in one morning.Get the other version."
2,"Sadly, the Kino edition has poor image quality as well","I rented the Kino version on the strength of a specific recommendation here, but it gave up watching after the first 15 minutes on account of the poor picture quality. It certainly does not look like a ""35mm nitrate print"" to these eyes--the visuals are muddy and the contrast is off, spoiling the visual detail. It could be from an old 16mm print, or else maybe a duplicated 35mm print, but it is certainly not a clear record of an original fine-grain release print, by any means. I will await a future restoration. For the present, Caveat emptor."
2,"Weak film, weaker print","This is a quite corny adventure film, one of the least significant movies Hitchcock ever made. It deserves the two stars by Maltin. Yes, Charles Laughton is good as the major villain, although his makeup could have used some work at times, especially during closeups. Yes, 19-year-old Maureen O'Hara is beautiful, even if her clothes never stay wet after swimming and her makeup never gets smeared. Yes, young Robert Newton is okay, even if his commission bearing his police credentials remain dry and clear after being in the ocean. But on the whole, this is a melodrama one can live without. Young people especially will guffaw at the hammy ending.A worse problem is the print. It's inferior. And at one point there is a jump that eliminates five or ten minutes of the story. There is no excuse for putting this sort of print on DVD."
3,STODGY HITCHCOCK FLICK,"Laughton plays the leader of a band of plundering pirates in this adventure yarn based upon Daphne DuMaurier's soapy gothic novel. He was originally cast as a licentious parson, but, because of a possible (and most likely) run-in with the notorious Hays Office, was switched to the squire role. The ravishingly beautiful but unknown Maureen O'Hara was eighteen here, in her film debut. Laughton informed the other cast members that they should all get behind Maureen and help her: ""Two days later, we were fighting for our scenes. That child was stealing our scenes from us!"". Also in the cast is playwright Emlyn Williams (THE CORN IS GREEN & NIGHT MUST FALL) and Basil Radford, who had charmed audiences the previous year in Hitchcock's THE LADY VANISHES. This was the last film Hitchcock made in pre-war Britain; he would soon after set sail for America, where he was destined for enormous fame."
2,Missing links,"It's a shame the quality of this video is poor. The movie is fascinating. The sound quality, however, is so variable that much of the dialogue vanishes. One key transition scene is missing entirely. Maureen O'Hara is seen dripping wet in her ""chemise"" in one scene, then the picture freezes and she is transported, without explanation and fully clothed, to Jamaica Inn. There must be a better print of this movie."
1,Not the best,"Wether this verson has been updated and cleaned up, doesn't really matter.What I've seen is a very poor recording, very bad sound (that makes it hard to hear what is being said),and bad picture quality.A film from the master of suspence should be given the recognition it deserves."
3,Heavy-handed acting,"This film should have been excellent, but, as noted by many people, the heavy-handed acting by Charles Laughton ruins the movie. It should have been good because Laughton could be good, because the film is based on a good story by Daphne Du Maurier and it introduces Maurene O'Hara who performs well, and it is directed by Hitchcock. Yet, as previously stated, Laughton acts like a ham in the film and the lighting is far too dark."
4,Jamaica Inn,"Charles Laughton was really great in this movie and his role was believable but to me, I really wasn't all that nuts about Maureen O'Hara's role because I read the book at least five times (one as a book report in Highschool) and she wasn't really close to the Mary Yellan I knew from the book. It was indeed a pretty well done film but if you want to see the version which is closer to the book, you must see the 1980's version (I believe that is the time the film was made) with Jane Seymour as a true to the book Mary Yellan, Patrick McGoohan as the Uncle, Trever Eve as the young horse thief she falls in love with and the talented Billie Whitelaw as the spooked Aunt Patience. This is a movie worth seeing."
3,Good!,"Hitchcock performs a massacre of Daphne's book, but somehow, being a talent powerhouse, he makes it work - at least in some places. Daphne's Mary is a dreamy kind of a girl liable to get frightened but not a coward. O'Hara has a strong voice, she is never really frightened, the only time she lets us down ( of course being her first movie) when she calls her Aunt Patience several times - seems contrived. Even when confronted with prospect of rape she never loses her composure and says that she is ready for anything! And a delightful figure!Of course, Mary falls in love with Joss's brother and not a officer of law as shown in the movie. The hero is quite ugly and it would have been better had be been hanged successfully in the beginning of the film. Charles goes over the top but has a variety of expression in his repertoire which he uses outlandishly and is a delight to watch. Overall, it is still a good entertainment. And particularly for those who have read the book - they must see it."
5,Very enjoyable!,"I enjoyed this movie a lot. It is done in an old-fashioned style, but there's nothing wrong with that! As others have noted here, Charles Laughton puts in quite a performance. The gang of cutthroats are a colorful bunch of characters, the settings are very atmospheric and Robert Newton and Maureen O'Hara provide characters to root for."
4,Good but not great.,"Into the Skyline by Cathy Dennis is a good dance/pop album but it's not her best. Into the Skyline was produced by Shep Pettibone (he is known for producing Madonna's Erotica album), he is a wonderful producer but this album is a little disappointing. There are some great songs on her like Falling, Why, and You Lied to Me but the rest are mostly filler. I think Cathy Dennis was such a trailblazer in the early '90s, great singer and songwriter. Can't give this girl anything less than 4 stars."
4,This CD Rocks!,"""You Have Another Lover"" is a serious dance track, to which you can not stop tapping your feet at about 80bpm. If you like to dance, and I mean serious, wild, crazy bump and grind dance then you will love this CD."
4,Great update sound,"I have Cathy Dennis first album and thought I would get this as I loved her first, and this one does not disappoint. Very upbeat, great dance music and just a great album."
3,"Great book for its time, still applicable","Talks about challenging your preconceived notions of spending & saving.Not as thorough as tightwad Gazette, but still worth the read."
4,"Nice shoe, Not a lot of support","I like this shoe; it looks nice and is pretty well made. However, it needs more support in the sole. I would buy this shoe again for the price. It certainly makes a great running aroung town shoe, but not a decent work shoe if you're on your feet any length of time."
1,"If you learn by doing, this book is not for you.","I like books that teach by working through a sample project. The best of these types of books will give you the basic aspects of programming to get you up and running. This book is bits and pieces of Visual Interdev, but just when you think you're off and running it stops short, which is my take on the whole book."
4,"Great example project, introductory explanations and tips.","I liked this book for a number of reasons. First, it has a great sample Visual Interdev project to learn from. Second, the author gives the type of tips/recommendations not explained in documentation but needed in working in the real world. Finally, what is explained is explained well. My only criticism is that the book could have covered more topics and details, but then I don't think that is the nature of these ""Dummy"" books. Of all of the books on VI that I have purchased (or returned) I like this one the best and would recommend it highly."
3,Not very detailed-dummies series I guess,"You have to have VID enterprise edition if you want to hop on database stuff. That is one thing. The other is that author does not give full and detailed explanations of his doings-global.asa file is not always created by itself but rather you have to go into ODBC to set it up!!! Other than that it has some BASIC intro to ASP. These Dummies books do not offer much for 30 bucks. They worth barely 20, that is why I order them through Amazon."
3,Great Introduction to VI 6,"Was a complete dummy to VI6. Someone else told me this was the software I needed, so I got it but didn't know what it was used for. While VI6 is a huge product, this book gets you up and going pretty quickly. In here are enough examples to get a good idea of what you can do. Billy Bobs Auction (an example site he builds) is nowhere near the scope of the projects I am about to undertake, but it did provide a good starting point for me. The book was easy to understand, and in most all cases, the book matched what he said the software was going to do.Only 3 stars because it is a beginners book... and I do need more in depth information now..."
4,A very good book to get a handle on VI 6,I enjoyed this book. Excellent for new-comers and those who are upgrading from VI 1.0. I strongly recommend this book.
4,Great Book,"I own several VID 6 books and this one answered many questions the others didn't. It was easy to understand and I would highly recommend to anyone. The book doesn't cover everything; however, it covers the most common tools you need to get the job done. Wonderful book!"
2,Great material! Lousy remastering job. Buy the old releases.,If you're a Manilow fan you know every note of every song and just how it sounds. Too bad Arista records let someone remaster the Manilow catalog who had never heard the original versions. A true fan will probably enjoy hearing the instruments mixed a little differently but if you want the songs to sound like you remember them you should buy the Greatest Hits package. In this day of wonderful remastering jobs (like the one done recently for the Bee-Gees) it's a crime that such an important artist has had his material butchered by his former label.
5,Wow!!!!!!,"Ok, it's so strange, my friends think i'm totally weird, but i adore Barry Manilow! I'm only 14, so my friends are like, ""you like who?""Barry Manilow is one of the most talented artists of all time EVER, and this amazing CD gives you some of his greatest hits. I would definitely recommend this to any Manilow fan.My only regret is i wasn't growing up when he was at his most popular... :-("
1,NOT AS GOOD AS THE OLD GREATEST HITS PACKAGE!,I am a longtime Manilow fan. I admit it. I own everything they've released. When I put this on I was so disappointed. The songs don't sound right. The arrangements sound very different. It seems like I hear a lot more bass and a lot less of everything else. I liked these songs when they were hits and that's how I want to hear them. While I like the songs on this package I can't recommend you buy it. I'd stay with the old Greatest Hits CD. It's done right and sounds great.
5,I dig this Collection,"I've like much of barry Manilow's material for years.He has showcased many of his Styles on Here.when I read the Lyrics&&see the Arrangements to certain songs He does I can see a Influence on Babyface.""I Write The Songs"" is something else.enjoy."
1,ULTIMATE RIP-OFF,"Do not purchase this download. Track 15 has a serious glitch in it at about 2:30 seconds. It may well be in the master, too."
3,Ultimate Manilow-Critique,"Barry is quite the singer and entertainer. No doubt, this album is one of his best boxed sets yet. However, there are some songs that were once popular on the radio (both on the pop charts and the adult contemporary charts)that are not listed on this set. For example, ""You're Looking Hot Tonight"", ""I Don't Want To Walk Without You"", ""One Voice"", ""Sweet Heaven, I'm In Love Again"" (from the movie ""copacabana""), ""I'm Your Man"", ""In Search Of Love"", ""Oh, Julie"", ""When I Wanted You"", ""Brooklyn Blues"", ""Memory"", ""Some Kind Of Friend"", and other songs that were on the original ""Barry Manilow: Greatest Hits"" double album. Perhaps, maybe an Anthology album would welcome these other songs that seem to have been forgotten. If you're looking to purchase a greatest hits mini box set collaboration of hits, this album is good. But, don't be too disappointed for not hearing all of his most popular songs."
3,Manilow,A little disappointed in the quality of the CD. The music is a bit off and too slow. I owned a Barry Manilow CD before and this one seems slow and dragging.
5,Manilow for President,"This is by far the greatest purchase I have ever made music wise. I put it in my CD player in the car and listened straight through and cannot listen to anything else. This is the first Manilow CD I have ever purchased and it is the best CD of any I have ever bought. Tracks 1-20 leave you wanting to put the whole CD on repeat and listen for hours on end. Track 8, Weekend in New England, could be the greatest song I have ever heard. I will buy as many Manilow albums I can get my paws on. Barry Manilow FOREVER!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Great!,"So many people have never taken him seriously. That's because they have no understanding of talent or superb craftsmanship. A great example is in the one star review below. Sigh. Making fun of him is pretty cliche. It went out of style 20 years ago. Maybe it's time the naysayers grew up a little. People might of made fun of him, but guess what?. 20 some years later and he is still here!. This CD debuted at number 3 on the charts in a world filled with Britneys and Limp Bizkits. Mr. Manilow has definitley gotten the last laugh. The detractors can laugh all you want, but it won't amount to a hill of beans. He proved himself decades and decades ago and is still doing it. Laughing at him is as meaningless as ever."
2,Ultimate bad tracks,"I really love the music and energy of Ultimate Manilow. But , unfortunately, there are a number of tracks that skip, jump, and repeat, making it very difficult to really enjoy. I'm not sure of the process to get it replaced."
1,For Cultural Lemmings Everywhere,"Please! Five stars for a collection of the sappiest songs of all time? It is pretty hard to take seriously someone who claims to have invented music (""I am music and I write the songs"") yet the abundance of five star reviews here proves that PT Barnium was right...."
1,PLEASE!! I only bought this for a friend's birthday,"I would never, in a million years, voluntarily listen to Barry Manilow!!!I hated him when his music was popular, back in the 70's, and the intervening years have done nothing to enhance his appeal.However, one of my friends actually enjoys his music, so, for her 60th birthday, I bought a couple of his c.d.'s for her. There is no accounting for taste, obviously!"
1,I am Music and I Write the Songs?,It is pretty hard to take seriously someone who claims to have invented music. Five stars? Please. The 70's are over people.
1,The Horror... The Horror...,"People are complaining that this hasn't received the full 24-bit digital remaster treatment like, say, Pink Floyd's ""Echoes""? Does the figure of speech ""You can't polish a turd"" mean anything to you? Barry's best work barely gets beyond the emotional depth of a car park mud puddle. I mean, people made fun of him in the 1970s for goodness sake!"
1,i would never buy this again,"if i have to vote the worst music i've bought and listened to from Amazon.com than this is it, it totally irratiting and I could not recommend anyone wasting their money on this. Please print this."
4,Manilow's Greatest--to a point...,"This has the best of Barry's ballads without a doubt. And, if you want to hear the hits, then this is it. But, the album ends in 1984 with ""When October Goes"" from Paradise Cafe, his jazz album. He did lots of other interesting stuff after that--pop, jazz and even dance tracks. Not to mention work he did with other artists. Nonetheless, his #1 singles are all on here, along with some of the sweetest ballands you'll ever hear. So if you are new to Barry, then This One's For YOU!!!..."
4,Camp Classics,"Barry Manilow has always been scorned by the critics and immensely loved by his fans. While he never breaks any new musical grounds, Mr. Manilow has a great ear for a melody and his records are always finely crafted. But most of all, his music is fun. How can you not enjoy something as goofy as ""Copacabana"" or something a saccharine sweet as ""Mandy"". Mr. Manilow was at his commercial peak in 1970's and the bulk of this collection comes from that period. Barry Manilow is a guilty pleasure and songs like ""Can't Smile Without You"", ""Daybreak"", """"Looks Like We Made It"" and others are pure ear candy."
3,IF you like Manilow....,"Yes, I actually have this album,and I enjoy SOME of it(when I am in the mood)...If you like love songs and lyrics that can rip out your heart and stomp it into the ground..this is the album! Warning: DO NOT Listen to this if you are already upset and depressed over a girl (Mandy, Can't smile w/o You,etc.,etc.),a death (Ships,reminds me of my Dad). All In all though this is beautifully done and I enjoy it when the mood strikes"
3,Worth Owning Just to Irritate Manilow Haters,"Yes, it is elevator music, but it is good elevator music! I would call this ultimate easy listening. Good music to relax by. Dinner music. It's lounge or nightclub music that you don't really listen to closely, except with Manilow, you do listen. I have a hard time deciding if I really like this album or not; probably am somewhat indifferent to it. It's NOT a ""must have."" I had it given to me, so I'll keep it, but it's not something that I'll wear out listening to over and over. Good for a listen now and then. Worth owning just to irritate your friends who are into ""heavy metal"" or ""acid rock"". Seems that most either love Manilow or hate him. If you don't love him, you may want to spend your music dollars on someone who you do love."
5,"just add more bass, barry","Barry gets wicked just like Cube did back in the pre-Friday era...blazing angry rhymes over dope beats and piano solos. All the hataz out there get dropped and the hoochies get served. I could listen to this all day, hey wait, I think I will. stop the madness"
3,My Farts Sound Better,This album reminds me of when I've eaten way to many burritos and regreted it the next morning. Barry has a way of adding a zesty spice to even the biggest poops. A true talent in the fine art of log launching.
1,Quite Possibly The Worst Ever,"Barry Manilow isn't my favorite astist but clearly has some good songs that are fun to listen to and sing along with. However, this set of gems reminds me of a cross between elevator music and lounge renditions. They don't sound like they do on the radio and they're almost karaoke like. Spend your money on something else."
1,Ultimate Poo,"It's true -- old ladies do indeed love these pop nuggets. I do not.Manilow is no doubt a genius, for he has made songs that reek of poo yet they somehow scale the charts. He has achieved the impossible, you could say.My mom recently got this CD, and it's been playing in the house for about a week. It's been the longest week of my life.This stuff is bad news, people. ""Bandstand Boogie"" ranks as one of the worst songs I've ever heard. Along with ""Mandy,"" ""This One's For You,"" ""I Write The Songs,"" (yes -- the bad ones) and the sudser ""Could It Be Magic.""It could be magic if this CD would disappear out of my mom's CD player. I tried hiding it a few times, but mom always somehow finds it.""I write the songs that make the young girls cry...""Yes, Barry, but they're crying for a different reason than you think."
3,Record Company Ripoff,"This is a classic example of a record company milking its cashcow by churning out yet another packaging of hits. Sure it's great to have all the great Barry tunes on one CD as opposed to the three-CD set released years ago. At the same time you would think that the company would have forked out a few dollars to make it worthwhile to longtime fans. How about digital remastering? ""Mandy"" is a great song but it would be nice to not hear the audio limitations associated with recording the song more than 20 years ago. You can also go round-and-round about which songs could and should have been included. I personally would have liked to see them expand the tracks by five or more. Groups like Aerosmith have been able to churn out 20+ single CD hit compilations. If you are new to the magic of Manilow this will probably suit your needs if sound isn't that big a deal. For hardened fans, save the money."
3,Disappointing sound quality.,"O.K., so I'm an old softy and like the old Manilow material, (as well as the Carpenters for that matter...what can I tell you I grew up on this stuff), but come on, where is the digital production value?!? At least Richard Carpenter and his engineer Roger took the time to get rid of the hiss in their recordings of the same vintage. ARISTA didn't seem to invest anything into this project, certainly not on cleaning up the old tapes for a CD release. On ""Mandy"" sure, you can hear the sustain pedal on the piano, that's cool...gives it that, ""I never heard that when I bought it on cassette"" feel, but for goodness sake, GET THE HISS OUT!!! The man and his material hold up just fine, but YO, cough up a few bucks CLIVE DAVIS and do this deal right next time!"
2,please 5 stars,barry manilow songs are great. my favorites daybreak (live) not studio recording. does not give feeling. neither did it's a miracle on this cd. then the cd was not remastered to sound good. when turned up high. the speakers rumbeled. i hope his other essential collection has that. comeing soon. not buying it. if it dont have it's a miracle right or daybreak (live). lucky i got his greatest hits back in 1989. true to the album.
5,A single-CD anthology that makes the others obsolete,"Arista can begin to clean up its scatter-shot catalogue of Barry Manilow collections now that they have put together a creditable one-disc anthology that actually works. 20 tracks in chronological order (not quite the order listed on Amazon) that capture all the high points (i.e. popular hits) for the occaisional Manilow admirer who just wants one CD and the most dedicated fan who wants to cap his/her collection with a pleasurable one-stop summary. Good selection, good sound, good booklet, good job Arista."
2,Too Predictable!,"If you've seen horror movies before then you'll easily be able to predict what happens in this movie after the first 20 minutes or so. Although there are some creepy scenes towards the end; the film, for the most part, suffers from a paper thin plot, sub par acting, and a lack of excitement. Like a reviewer said before me, the film is choppy and many scenes are very tedious and boring making it hard to not hit your fast forward button.I wasn't really expecting too much from this film and ""Room 6"" delivered pretty much what I expected. There are much better horror films out there, I'd suggest renting this before you buy it."
3,"Some good chills, but not too original...","There are some interesting developments, but basically all the characters are clueless and can't seem to figure out what's right in front of them. ""Room 6"" immediately reminded me of John Carpenter's ""They Live"", without the originality, suspense, and especially its way of making the audience learn everything along with the characters, instead of planting clues early on. Not the best; glad it was loaned to me."
3,Room 6 is a boreong place,"Room 6 is a real teaser.Slow going and boreing. You expect to see some skin fromChristine,but you will be waiting a lomg time.She certainly could do a lot better."
2,Room 6? ......what a sleeper!,"You want a play by play of this movie, then watch it! This movie is predictable, cliche and it moves like a made for t.v. movie, or an hour and a half long episode of the twilight zone, or the outer limits. For horror fans- gorey it is not! some ok make up jobs fill out the special effects portion of this film. Plus some choppy editing make some of this film annoying to watch. Christine taylor gives good face in this movie, very expressive, however you get tired of her screaming and gasping through the films duration. The only thing that kept my interest is the hospital sequences, I thought were moody and creepy, not gross creepy, but forbodding and ominous. Story line wise the hospital sequences were also weak as far as character development, and tying up loose ends. Unless you're a die hard Christine Taylor fan, this movie is only good for a rental, its definately not worth the retail pricetag anywhere. Bottom line....very dull."
3,This is not the worst movie I've ever seen,"I almost feel guilty having enjoyed this movie. It was obviously low budget with some bad acting, but overall, I didn't feel it was a waste of time. It had a kind of interesting story and a few intense moments. I think the lesbian nurses was a bit much, but hey...It's a twist. A twisted twist, but a twist none the less. Even as I was watching the movie I was thinking, I should not be enjoying it but I was, and I knew that I would be having images of this film in my head when I went to bed. The ending kind of let me down on the bad bedtime images expectations, but all in all, I would watch it again and am not ashamed to recommend it as an entertaining diversion. Not great, but not bad."
2,low budget shocker disappoints,"This Anchor Bay direct to video flick has a terrific premise about a manwho is in an automobile accident and is taken to a hospital that haslong been closed. His girlfriend tries to find him. The suspense isexcellent. Then, once the truth is revealed, the movie slows and theeffects are largely overdone and cheap, with a lot of ambiguity as tojust what happened. It would have been much better if there were noghosts and the story had a logical conclusion. Still, it will give theviewer a few good moments. I guess you could do worse."
1,"MISERABLE ! ! ! BAD acting, BAD dialog and BAD script","""ROOM 6 - DVD""LOOK...If I can stop just one person from blowing your hard earned money, not to mention your precious time, on this horrible movie then I'll feel like my job is done here. I'm so ticked off I waisted my time and money on this garbage I just had to warn the public myself. Don't get me wrong, I can like a bad movie but ROOM 6 is just flat out horrible.The dialog has to be the worst. The story line is used and worn out. The acting is flat out terrible(no one was good in this flop!). But what I couldn't get over was how staged everything felt. I felt like I was on the set of the movie(which I've never been) and I just wanted to say, ""let's do that take again"". Seriously, the acting is terrible, terrible, terrible.HEED MY WARNING...SAVE YOUR MONEY.I give, ROOM 6, 2 thumbs down and 2 middle fingers straight to the producers!!! Oh yeah, one other thing... I want my money back!"
1,Yawn!,"I thought the plot really dragged in this sappy, semi-scary film about a young women who's frightened of hospitals, but has to go into one to rescue her husband. Of course, in conquering her fears she saves his life, blah, blah, blah. Her husband, meanwhile, discovers that four of the nurses are blood-drinking lesbians in one of the most blatantly stupid scenes in the entire film. Clearly, somebody on the production staff must have realized that this film was a dud and that perhaps by adding a completely unimaginative girl/girl/girl/girl encounter they could somehow save it. But alas, this film is one patient that was beyond saving."
5,one of his best,"This story has all the usual L'amour traits, revealed such a way that you simply cannot put it down."
5,Shalako all LaMoue books,"I really enjoy reading Louis LaMour's books and am trying to collect all his books (except for the Hopolong Cassidy books, don't care as much for them)."
5,From Cloister To Freedom,"Mary's story is the story of thousands of young Catholics who searched for God and found Him/Her in the convent, seminary or monastery. She tells of the strictness she experienced in the noviate and as a fuly vowed nun. You and I get to experience the life of the convent from the eyes of this dedicated nun. She begins to doubt the austerity and restrictiveness as a result of the openness of Vatican II. She takes the plunge to Freedom. We see her struggle to find the same God experience outside the Convent. She does find this in her marriage and new life. What I like best is that Mary shows her deep appreciation and love for all those nuns she learned and lived with. It's a book that will move you to tears, remembering the old ways."
4,"Quick, easy read","This was a quick read portraying the struggles of a young boy coming of age in Kenya with the onset of the Mau Mau uprising and the opression that led to it. The novel's simplicity may make it seem like an elementary book, but this is what makes it genuine and a good beginning for anyone who is just starting to learn about the atrocities that happened throughout white man's rule of Africa and what is still going on today. It's not hard to see why Ngugi was so wrongfully punished for his bringing these events to the forefront as he definitely was making some point-blank political statements (and very brave)."
2,Republished stories that should have been updated.,I made the mistake of buying this book and not checking the publication date of the stories. Both are from the 70's and could have used some updating. The Publisher Weekly review was right on about the stories.
5,"Maybe This Christmas, My Darling Jenny","The book was really good, but when I got to page 151, it didn'tfinish the story of My Darling Jenny, instead it jumped to page177 and went on with the next story Strange Bedfellow. I thought this was weird. Is there pages missing or what?"
1,"Stupid, stupid, stupid!","I picked this book up at the library just so I could get a taste of Janet Dailey - OMG, what a waste of my time! I didn't even bother reading the second story - Darling Jenny was more than enough! I skipped through so much of it because it literally hurt my head to read it. Just flat out awful and the storyline was just flat out stupid!"
5,Car Jammin',"I sing along to this album everyday while rocking out in my car!I have seen Til live many times and am always satisfied at the end of the show. He is a kick-ass lyricist, and multi-talented musician. I love this album, even when it starts to leans towards the strange... I also have his third album, LOVESICK (which I got at his website, www.tilwillis.com)."
3,The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert,"I was very excited to find this for sale on Amazon, and ordered a copy for myself and my sister, who also loves this show. However, we were very disappointed to find that it is incomplete. Lacking on this DVD are the many fabulous songs by Extreme. Cherone delivers such a spirited tribute on the original copy, and there is only a small sampling of his rousing appearance. I would love to find a copy of the concert in its entirety. Liat Faver"
5,The tribute concert,Love this DVD. I watch it all the time when I'm working out. It's such a celebration of life and Freddy's amazing talent!
3,I can't understand why they cut the first part on DVD.......,"I owned it on laserdisc and I've been waiting for the DVD release for a long time....so when I bought it (Region 4)...Well I am very disappointed....the first part of the show (Metallica, Def Lepard, Extreme..)was taken out of the DVD !!! So tell me why they insert extra material and cut out the first part of the show ??"
2,Dissapointed,"I am dissapointed of the this DVD to much cut out during the concert, & more on behind the scene... who cares!"
3,Just the best Half,"The DVD quality is very good, but the bad thing is that you only get the half of the concert. There is the second part, after Liz Taylor speech, and you miss the Metallica, Guns and Roses, Extremme, Deff Lepard and other groups that opened that concert.If you want the full concert, this is not the DVD you looking for."
5,Never saw prior versions and some thoughts,"I never saw the MTV broadcast sadly and never owned the VHS version. I do have this DVD and I love it, it brings tears to my eyes every time.It is very possible that while the DVD is missing tracks there is more than the assumed reason that the DVD people botched it.Itis possible that legal issues cropped up to prevent the release of the entire original concert.Yes the songs are all Queen songs but the concert was before DVDs were the norm and the bands who performed may have signed off on Video rights but when it came to DVD rights they wouldn't allow it. I don't know I'm just saying it is VERY possible that the DVD is missing tracks for other reasons than the ones assumed!Anyway just becuase it isn't the VHS or entire concert version it is still a fabulous heartbreaking DVD and I love it!"
3,Technical Regression Is Better,"I Do Not have this DVD, Have Not Watched It, Nor Shall I Purchase It.Belonging to the ""Old School of Technology"", I have the Concert, as issued on VHS, in the somewhat forgotten but STILL AVAILABLE LaserDisc format.The Whole Show, Digital Video & Audio.Do Yourself a favor and pick up a LaserDisc Player for a few bucks and check out The Original Concert Issue, plus many more ""Old Music Videos"" that will probably never make it to DVD/BlueRay."
2,"The Laserdisc is so much better, since it has the whole show","My long time waiting for a DVD version of that old but great Laserdisc was wasted. It's absolutely depressing what they did here, by cutting some of the best parts of the original show.The Queen Medley by the great band Extreme was probably the best part of this show, not only because the way they played, but also because the playlist choice. A Medley of Bohemian Rhapsody, Bycicle Race, Another One Bites Dust, Keep Yourselves Alive, and others leading to one of the most beautiful moments of the show: the Radio Ga Ga ending, leading the audience to tears.Although the sound has been improved and a new and useless ""extra materials"" has been added, it doesn't worth the content they cut (opening act, Metallica, Def Leppard, GnR, Extreme and others).I would never exchange the old original laserdisc for this useles ""extra materials"" with a bunch of new footage."
3,"""Two-Disc"" DVD a Misnomer","This review is a rehash of most of the other reviews, but I'll echo the general sentiments: this is one of the best benefit-type concerts ever staged, incredible sound quality, great visuals, fine musicianship, and the like. If you're a big Queen fan it's a must-have DVD. But there's no question the ""double DVD"" labeling gives you the impression it's the whole concert unabridged, which it isn't -- it's only the last half of the concert with the surviving Queen members. Omitted where mostly three-songs sets by Def Leppard, Metallica, Extreme and GnR. And these were tremendous sets. A real shame they didn't include them on the second DVD. I hope Bryan May, Roger Taylor and John Deacon fix this."
3,I want it all!!!!!,"I originally recorded this concert live using a few VCR tapes off of MTV. With that I got too many commercials and poor quality audio and video. I was hoping this was going to replace my tapes. It might have replaced one.The footage shown would be awesome to any Queen fan. The DTS (if you have the capability) puts you right there in the crowd. But it's ONLY the last part of an entire day of music.I was really hoping for the entire concert and if that ever comes out, that'll be the one to own.As a HUGE Queen fan, I was disappointed there wasn't more!"
3,REASON FOR CUT PERFORMANCES ON DVD,"THE REASON WHY CERTAIN PERFORMANCES WERE CUT (GNR, METALLICA, EXTREME, DEF LEAOPARD TO NAME A FEW) WERE DUE TO COPYRIGHT ISSUES FOR PUTING THE CONCERT ON DVD...IF YOU ARE A TRUE QUEEN FAN THIS DVD IS FINE BUT FOR THOSE WHO WANT THE CONCERT IN ITS ENTIRTY WILL HAVE TO SETTLE FOR THE VHS AT THIS TIME....WHO KNOWS WHEN THEY'LL RE-ISSUE THE DVD...MAYBE THEY WILL ON BLU-RAY ONE DAY, BUT FOR NOW IT'S ALL WE GOT AT THE MOMENT..."
1,No Extreme? No dice. Don't buy this garbage.,"Unbelievable. Simply unbelievable. How these ""so called"" video editors could cut out the very best performance of the entire concert is beyond me. Without the show stopping performance of Extreme and their melody of Queen tunes this is just an average concert. Whoever is responsible for cutting Extreme out of the final cut should be ashamed of themselves. They need to find a new line of work because evidently they aren't even qualified to edit my home movies.What a disappointment this DVD was. :("
5,Great Concert,"hearing George Michael do SOmebody to Love was a great Moment on this set.ELton John&Axel ROse Dueting was something special as well.it was a great tribute.Seal,Annie Lennox,Bowie,ETC.. made this a Special COncert."
2,Totally disappointed,"i can't wait to see the dvd version that i have been waited for years to released. However to my disappointment, it's no more in the oringinal full version, such as the opening perfomance byMetallica, Extreme and others. i was so regret that i gave away my LD version to my friend. i wish that the producing company could release the full version. i knew all the fans out there wouldn't mind to buy it one more time"
2,Missing Parts of the Concert,"When I purchased the product, I was expecting a full length concert but to my disappointment, lots of missing parts of it was not included in the DVD. Such as the performances of Def Leppard, Mertallica, Extreme, Guns n' Roses & other artists whom I know participated in the concert. I was not informed that the DVD I was purchasing during the time contains and limited to only selected concert performances."
2,Poor taste,"I was so excited to finally be finding this on DVD, but like so many others, I am extremely disappointed in that not only were all of the opening acts and footage of Freddie's performances cut out, also Elizabeth Taylor's appearance was cut out! She was one of the main people behind putting this concert together not only for the sake of raising money for AIDS Research, but also in honor of ""Queen"" and Freddie. Cutting this out was in extremely poor taste! I am so glad I still have my video and that it still works well, but this DVD needs to be re-released with all of the proper footage that is suppose to be on this recording!"
5,THE GREAT ONE BEING HONOURED BY GREAT ONES,"A galaxy of super stars pay tribute to the greatest showman of all time with the STYLE & CLASS that QUEEN demonstrated time and time again. Great sound , energetic , passionate and heartfelt performances make this the best concert of all time. Seeing these stars do their best to belt out these tunes though they did very well, shows just how superior Freddie Mercury's talent was, he will be forever missed, great way of saying thanks and goodbye to a LEGEND. QUEEN FOREVER."
1,SKIP THIS ONE,"I have bought this DVD 2 months ago from Australia. I really wish I have never bought it at all. Do yourselves a favor, save your money or buy ""WE WILL ROCK YOU"" DVD instead if you don't have one. It is much much much better."
3,No Guns N' Roses or Metallica songs! Nice DVD though :(,"The songs that are actually on the DVD are great! I can't beleive they left off 3 songs by Guns N' Roses and Metallica! Other songs are missing too! How can they make 2 DVD discs and not have the whole concert on there? This makes no sense! I should have taped the show a long time ago! I was looking forward to watching the GNR songs! ... A lot of people are going to be disappointed, like me..."
3,disappointment,"I've been waiting for this on DVD since the DVD format came out. I watched the televised portion of the concert, and I bought the VHS concert. To have such an array of stars astonished me. From Metallica to Liza Minelli. Let's just say I'm grateful I still have a VCR and the VHS version of this magnificent concert.Although it brought out the same emotions it brought out on the VHS concert version, the DVD lacks the sets of Metallica, Gun-n-Roses, and Extreme. Those sets were a large part of the concert because they completed the variety of the show."
2,"Move on, you don't want this one....","As a fan of both Queen and the bands that perform at this show I can honestly say this is the worst edition of the concert ever published.I recorded it when it aired live on MTV, and I'd still have it if my dad hadn't taped over it! They did an absolutely horrid job compiling this show. So much is missing. Robert Plant's oustanding cover of ""Innuendo"" is missing, as is Def Leppard's cover of ""Now I'm Here"" and Extreme's 15 minute long Queen medley.I also hate the menu design, it's very difficult to navigate.On the positive side there are plenty of extra goodies, such as band interviews and all the videos they played on the big video screens in the stadium in between acts.Overall this is not nearly worth the 20+ dollar price tag."
2,...Go Buy the VHS...,"I was so excited to see this out on DVD, I went right out and bought it without checking it out. I've worn out 2 VHS tapes of the concert. Why am I [mad]? Because they cut out a good 45 minutes of music. Three incredible Metallica songs, a very good Guns n Roses set, a fun Xtreme medley, and an amazing Def Leppard/Brian May version of Here I am. Don't get me wrong, the other songs are also great, but why cut anything?I can't believe anyone who has the tape or the VideoDisc could ever give this a good review. This a big business trying to make a quick buck by ripping off people who don't know any better and impulse-buying dummies like me.At least they could have put the remaining songs on the second DVD. Don't buy this DVD. There's plenty of new VHS tapes available on Ebay for about 20 bucks.I'd give it one star...but for Freddie, I'll give it 2."
1,It's a great concert but the DVD sucks,"This DVD set is a huge disappointment. How could the DVD have FEWER matertials than the VHS version?! I was expecting to see not just what they have on the VHS, but also the ones they edited out, but no! They have 2 discs and this is all they could put in? I just couldn't believe it! Guess I should buy the VHS tape on eBay instead..."
1,Quit Editing,"I don't own this DVD but based on the reviews I will not be purchasing it. I orginally taped this concert when it was on MTV years ago. Because my TV was a piece of junk at the time, the sound quality was terrible but I still have the tape. I ended up buying the official VHS tape when they released it but found that they had edited out some of the things that were shown on MTV when the concert first aired. Overall the VHS release still kicks... but I was somewhat disappointed. Now it sounds like they have edited out even more for the DVD. I am writing because I would like to see a multiple DVD un-edited version of this concert in it's entirety. I don't care what it costs. Put everything in there. People will buy it."
2,NO EXTREME!,I wish I had known this. The main reason I bought it was for Gare Cherone's contribution. Very disapointed.
3,There can be only one.,"This tribute proves there can be only one. It was sad to see so many people attempt to do Freddie's music. I thought Axl Rose should have stayed home. Although he did prove how much of a show man Freddie was, and what great shape he was in for his concerts. This tribute makes you realize how much was lost when the world lost Freddie."
1,What waste of $$$$$$$$,VERy dissapointed with this dvd brought it for the guns n roses show what isnt even on it ripped of false advertising crap dont waste your money
3,Good Not Great,"I'm a fan of Freddie Mercury so sometimes you have to overlook incomplete packages like this one.One note, the jazz number sang over the end credits by Mercury is incredible. I've tried to track down the name of the song with no luck."
5,I Love Queen and that's who I want to see!,"sorry, but i don't care that they edited G'n'R, metallica, and def leppard. i bought this dvd because i'm a queen fan - that's who i want to see. i don't want to sit through sets by those other bands because, well, they are kinda lame.as always, brian, roger, and john do a wonderful job with a bunch of singers who really illustrate how talented freddie was. almost none of them even come close to Queen Mercury. it's still a great show though.if you love queen, get this disc. you'll be very happy that you did."
3,toxicity and skin disease by mercury and zinc,i want usiny on vido for usiny as imagin and slid about effect disease of mercury and zinctank you
4,Building a SOF Kayak,"The book has all of the esential information to build a Skin On Frame Greenland Kayak. While at times the instructions may be vague, the reader is reminded that the Kayak is built to meet the builders specific needs. The book does not provide a detailed set of blue prints, rather instructions that capture the spirit of buiding a craft modeled after Native water craft in the Greenland style. The book is very detailed and provides many insights from the author regarding Greenland style Kayaks.I would definitely reccomend this book."
5,Communication Theory Comes Alive,"This book was a great book. The examples helped me understand communication theory and after I read the examples and the TIPS, I saw the relationship between theory and practice. Good job and a great price!"
4,"IF YOU LIKE GARDENIAS, YOU'LL LOVE THIS !","""Marc Jacobs"" the fragrance is young, fresh, and sensuous. It's pure, understated, simple, and unforgettable.Somehow he has done things with gardenias unheard of before. Remember granny's favorite gardenia perfume, a bit cloying, heavy? Uh-uh forget that. This interpretation of gardenia is cutting edge, it complements without overwhelming the wearer.Notes of Sicilian Bergamot and Tagete mingle with the top note, as accents of White Pepper and Egyptian Jasmine enrich.This is a fragrance for confident, unconventional young women."
5,Best scent ever!,This perfume is fresh and modern but very feminine and romantic. Everywhere I go people ask me what I'm wearing snd absolutely love it. It's surprising to have men I don't know say how much they like this fragrance and want to know what it is so they can get it for their wives or girlfriends. I wear the lotion and the perfume and it lasts all day but isn't overpowering. Love it!!!
2,"Smells nice, doesn't last","Smells great...doesn't last that long. Thought it was me, asked others...they all agreed. We couldn't smell anything after a couple of hours. What a waste of money."
1,Never received it!,"The item was being sold for $8.99, which I thought was too good to be true. Apparently it was. I received an email that said that the product was damaged and unable to be shipped. Why they couldn't just send me another one from their inventory, I have no clue. I even went back to the merchant's site and this product was still being sold...but for nearly $50! I don't know if the $8.99 listed as the price was an error on their part, but what a lame excuse not to sell it to me. A little bit of honesty would have been more appreciated."
3,Wonderful Album,"I have owned this album for years. I guess commercially it didn't do well which is a shame as I think Ronny Cox is a wonderful singer. Most of the songs on the CD are haunting, fun and all are entertaining. I wish Ronny would do more."
1,Big waste of money. Nothing in book that everyone does not already know,"I am very disapointed by this book. I bought it because the advertisement guaranteed a secret way to lower high blood pressure in two weeks. Surprise, the book said to exercise, eat better and go to the doctor for medication if it is more than a little bit high. No secrets in this book, just what you have already heard on television and from every other source."
1,not worth the price and seems a hazard,"I purchased this the other day before reading reviews. It looked cute and colorful. It is very small, has very few toys and afer assembling it I discovered not only was the giraffe velcro piece coming detached but that particular piece doesn't come with a toy. I am not crazy at the idea that the toys velcro instead of being stationary or having links to hold them in place. I read another review on the site I purchased it from that a Mother's baby choked on the butterflies after removing them by grabbing ahold of them. Her father discovered her choking child thankfully. The tiger only plays 2 tunes and not nearly long enough. The only plus I would even consider giving this is the bright colors and easy assembly but simply not worth it! I can see it becoming an easy bore for any baby."
2,I wish I had read reviews before I bought this..,"I am taking this back ASAP..my 3 month son and I both hate it. I really love the idea of it, but it just didn't work for us. One of the reasons I bought it was because it played music, but it only lasts for 5 seconds. Seriously, how is that long enough to be able to put ""musical"" in the title? The pillow is pointless because it's so small. He liked the mirror and the toucan, but they only kept him entertained for maybe a minute before he became fussy with those also. For nearly $40, this just isn't worth it..to me at least."
2,Rainforest Giraffe?,Very nice product. I like the colors and style but since when do you have giraffes in the rainforest?Not very educational for your kid ehh....
3,Free Gym Mat,"We received this gym mat for free, and it was worth every penny!Though our son liked lying on his back and looking at the various dangling parts of this gym mat, he is outgrowing it fairly quickly. The musical ball is nice because the music is not annoying. However, I am not sure that a baby could spin the ball fast enough to activate it by himself. Once a baby becomes more mobile, his arms flail out beyond the soft part of the mat toward the hard plastic edges.A bigger mat will last a longer time and offer more stimuli for the baby."
1,Worthless and Overpriced!,"I can't imagine any baby being interested in this. There is really not much to it, the velcro pieces pull off easily, the music player hangs down in the baby's face so if they roll over they hit their head on it, and the mirror/ball/flap on the end is pointless. The flap was almost permanently folded down, the ball barely spins, and the mirror is tiny. My son never cared anything for this playmat; when he got a little older he used it to stand up. All in all, this thing is a complete waste of money. If this playmat actually entertains a baby, it won't last very long."
2,velcro wears easily,"I bought this mat as I thought it would be good for my daughter to grow with. The velcro butterflies and toucan seemed like a good idea at first, but now that she's had it for about a month the velcro has worn and the butterflies don't stick for very long. She still likes the musical tiger, but the butterflies were what held her interest and now she can pull them off immediately. She's 4 months old and I bought it when she was a little over 3 months old. I think it's worth it to spend a little more and get a bigger play mat without velcro as it will last longer. She loves to play on the Tiny Love activity mat that our babysitter has."
2,Not worth it. There are better gyms,"The toys are velcro on. The Toys are also very high up and hard to reach. My child is 6 months and I bought this as another thing for her to do. She could barley reach it and she is tall for her age. The hanging Zebra is hard to work. The only thing she liked was teh butterflys, which she yanked off withing hte first 5 minutes and started chewing on. Fisher price can do better."
1,Gets boring,"My 5 month old liked this initially, but he's officially bored with it now. I wish I would've bought a play mat with more hanging toys. The 2 hanging toys are lame. Spend a little more, buy something with more toys!"
4,my baby loves it!,"I got this used from a local shop, and I have to say, it was totally worth it. I suggest to other buyers out there, check your local craigslist postings and thrift shops for your baby items. Alot of the stuff was used for a month or two, and is basically in new condition.My daughter loves this playmat and is fascinated with all the toys. The pillow seems a bit silly, but otherwise a wonderful purchase. I love that you can re-arrange the way the toys are places since it doesn't hook together any specific way."
1,boring...,Thought that this was very cute and had many things to do however I think it looks better than it actually is. My daughter really could have cared less about the entire thing. There really is only 4 things hanging down and they really don't go OVER the baby. I think that the entire point of a baby gym is to have the toys over the baby to reach out a grab. This is a total miss.
3,Not at all what I was expecting,"Cute, for a little while. My baby is 4.5 months old, and I highly doubt this will be used after he starts sitting up.the ""pillow"" for the headrest and for supporting a child to sit up is a complete and total joke. I would never leave my baby sitting up with that thing around, it would just help him fall over. Also, the pillow has no way to stay in place while he is laying down or sitting up. It slides all over the place. In fact, I have no idea where it is now. It was an annoying to keep up with it.The mirror is another joke. So tiny, I don't see how a baby can even see in it. Fisher price must have been using leftover pieces from other mirrors, it's so small.I can see that as my baby learns to grab better, that the velcro on toys won't be staying up for long.However, all that negative said, it does keep his attention for a little while."
3,Not as good as hoped,"I bought this play mat on a whim but now wish i had done some research first. I find the mat itself is way to narrow and thin. I always worry about my son rolling onto the plastic base on either side and hurting his head or face so i end up using a folded blanket over top which sort of defeats the purpose of a ""mat"". He seems to really enjoy the toys though and i like the fact that everything is interchangeable which helps keep him entertained. He also fell in lOVE with the giraffe and plays with it off of the mat which is one of the main reasons i haven't sold it. If i could re-do my purchase I would go with the Fisher-Price Rainforest Melodies & Lights Deluxe Gym, it seems like the much better version of this one."
2,I wouldn't buy this again.,"Don't buy this gym! Get a bigger one!We have a small house so I thought the smaller gym would be a good idea, but I really regret it. The pieces don't fit together quite right and things hang a little crooked, and it was hard to put together. The toys are not very fun or educational. Last, the narrow width is really bad - once your baby gets excited in the gym and tries to roll over, they can't - they will be prevented by the narrowness and the toy bar. One one of the larger square gyms, rolling over would be no problem, and rolling over is such an important skill. I feel like another gym would have offered a lot more possibilities and growth! I would NOT buy this one again. While I am glad there is a low-priced option for people who really can't afford a larger gym, don't buy this gym if you can possibly afford a bigger one!"
3,"good, not great",My granddaughter likes this all right. But she's more of a touch it/sound effect person and the ball on the cat is tough to get sound out of with tiny 2 1/2 month hands. She loves the bouncer that the slightest kick or hit will activate the sounds.
4,Excellent Beginning Toy For Babies,"Fisher-Price is well known for making toys that ""grow"" with their toughest critics, babies. The Fisher-Price Rainforest 123 Musical Gym is no exception. My son is four months old, and he loves to lie on his back and swat at the toucan rattle, butterflies, and tiger music box. He coos and giggles while he plays with them. There's also a giraffe and palm tree that he likes to look at. As he grows older and begins to lie on his belly more, there's another rattle, a mirror, and a peek-a-boo toy to play with as well. There's even a headrest that can move along with the child as they grow.This toy focuses on development of large motor skills. The ability for the toy to ""grow"" with the child makes it a pretty good buy in my opinion. I recommend it to families with babies who are at least two or three months old."
3,Larger gym is more practical,"This gym is OK for a little while, but once your child gets to exploring (4+ months) and needs more room to roam, this Gym is useless. It's very small, and only functions for the minimalist. In other words, the baby will grow bored rather quickly. If I could exchange it, I'd get the larger fisher-price baby gym with more toys on it."
2,This is is just okay,"What I like:- Colorful- Hanging objects are mildly entertaining- SmallWhat I Don't like:- Baby was only entertained for about 5 minutes max- ""Musical"" part was two 5 second tunes- Claim that it will grow with baby. I think baby will not be amused by it as soon as theres anything else to look at.- Pillow is so small its uselessThis will be the first to go when I start to sell my baby toys. I wouldn't bother saving it for my second child."
4,Good,"I have written a review on this book before. Now I have passed the exam, and therefore would like another (better) review on the book.I like the book, and the writing style. It's good on SQL. It might be weak on some areas, but overall, it's a good study guide for 70-028. Recommended. You should have noticed that there is no *one* single good book for the exam, therefore, be prepared to work on some external source like BOL and M$'s white paper.What I have heard is that it's better than the MOC, but relly don't know.Yes, I passed the exam after 2 tries. If you want to pass the exam just on this book, then forget it. It won't be sufficient. Use it as an introduction to SQL7, and read BOL and white paper!!! Then you will pass."
2,Errors,"This book seems to be fairly thorough when discussing SQL. However, there are many bugs in the Exercises causing the student to spend a great deal of time debugging the T-SQL statements. It appears that the editors didn't understand the subject matter well enough to catch the typo's and other sytax errors. I finally gave up on this book and purchased the Microsoft Self Paced Training Guide where the Exercises actually work. Exam 70-028 is my 6th exam for my MCSE."
4,Good outline of necessary topics,"This Sybex guide provides a good outline of the topics necessary to pass the exam. It is NOT sufficient of itself, but it does cover the required topics and lends structure to your studies. Combine this book with Books Online (and hands-on experience) for best results."
1,"Do yourself a favour, do NOT buy this book!","Note the worst book in the world, but fairly darn close. I bought three study guides for this exam and the only one that seemed to be helpful was the Coriolis Exam Prep by Talbert. It got a bit detailed in parts but was the clear winner of the three I read."
4,Good compilation of essays regarding the West vs. the Rest,"This short book does an excellent job of providing the reader with both sides of the ""West vs. the Rest"" debate. In addition to Huntington's essay, originally published in the fall of 1993, there are several counter-essays that argue against Huntington's original ""Clash of Civilizations?"" The book is finished off with another essay by Huntington, a counter to the counter-essays, entitled ""If Not Civilizations, What?"" Even though the essays were all originally published in the early 1990's, alot of their arguments still ring true in the world we live in today."
3,not worth buying....read at some bookstore,"I enjoyed the original book but this debate replies don't go in depth to become intriguing. It is a collection of responses from 7 other economist/historian/etc., and it is a very basic responses. I would just read it at some bookstore, and save the money. [.]"
4,Never sleep again,"Every child hears about certain mythical beings in their youth: Tooth Fairy, Santa Claus, The Boogeyman, and Freddy Krueger. Is it any wonder that he is such a cultural icon after this movie? Craven brings to the nightmares of the teens of Elm Street, and to us, a nightmare of his own youth. This movie explores the dark hearts of ""the guy next door"" in such characters as Freddy, Nancy's parents, and Tina's boyfriend. Just how much evil can exist in the suburbs? This movie also shows Nancy as a head's on ... gal who faces up to Freddy most of the movie instead of running away like most heroines do for the first few movies. Entertaining, ethereal, certainly scary. This is a must-see for any serious horror fan."
5,Wes Craven's original masterpiece,"If you haven't seen A Nightmare on Elm Street, you really need to check it out. This is one movie where bad dreams come true. However, if you are someone who gets nightmares from watching scary movies then don't view this film."
2,And you could be stuck watching Happy Days!,The neighborhood teens are being killed off one by one as the man they thought was dead returns to get the ultimate revenge. And their parents can't save them now. Try to stay awake through this one. There are better sequels and better times to be had.
5,the best devilish movie of all time well sort of!,well like i said this movie is one of the best movie movies ever
3,The best film Wes Craven created,"It did not scare me, but of course it was not meant to be scary, because it is a slasher movie."
5,"A surreal,scary and grotesque masterpiece.A classic. A 10.A+","Despite the junky sequels, Nightmare On Elm Street will haunt your dreams.Its gory and surreal.The images accomplish the nearly impossible feat of looking exactly like something out of your dreams.Although it would have been even scarier if they had Freddy kill someone in a cemetary(cemataries and corpses rising from the grave are my biggest phobias)it really accomplishes the goal of being scary and haunting. I had to watch Ren And Stimpy to humour myself up so as not to have bad dreams after watching this movie but a couple nights later the infamous Kruger haunted one of my dreams.Its a good thing that its impossible in real life to get killed from having a bad dream.This is unforgettable and ranks right up there with Texas Chainsaw Massacre,Night Of The Living Dead,The Exorcist,The Shining and It(the book not the movie)."
3,A pretty scary movie,"Nancy and her friends are having violent nightmares which all feature one commen element, a disfigured serial killer with a glove made of razors on his right hand. When one of the group is murdered in her sleep, Nancy realises she must stay awake and try to uncover the truth behing the phantasmic killer is Freddy Kruger."
5,OMG,"A Nightmare on Elm Street is actually my favorite movie of all time. It's just really an amazing story. And yes, it may be cheesy at times, but that is what 1980's horror is all about :)"
2,Interesting concept poorly delivered,"I think people are more scared of the IDEA of getting killed in your dreams and not being able to wake up and save yourself than they are of this movie. Because, I gotta tell ya, it wasn't scary. Yeah the idea of seeing one of your freinds being helplessly dragged around the ceiling while cuts start forming on her is unnerving, but really I was just waiting for people to die. This movie didn't suck me in one bit, didn't make me believe anything other than Freddy could very well be the most evil man in the slasher genre. He specifically targeted kids when he was alive, and that creeped me out more than thinking of him as a dream haunter. I don't know. Talks of a prequel are coming to fruition, and I think THAT would be a truly terrifying film. Skip this and go for what I consider to be the scariest film of all time, ""Halloween."" It's way better than this one."
3,"Good Movie, Good price",This is either the best or one of the best Wes Craven movies he has made. It changed the way we look at horror movies. 12.99 is a good price for the this edition even though you can get it at Target for 9.99.
3,Little Unhappy,September 10th just got my movie in the mail. I had just ordered it on the 7 of September so I was happy with that but when I opened it I was unhappy to find that the special features disc was not there. Didn't know that it wasn't with the movie. I would say it might be a good idea to say weather or not its there.
5,Iconic slasher flick,"This is it. The film that introduced the world to Horror icon Freddy Krueger. Of course Freddy wasn't the ONLY slasher in the '80s (with Michael Meyers and Jason Voorhees), but to me, Freddy is the absolute best! There are plenty of moments that'll make you jump out of your seat and there are also some just plain downright disturbing moments. If you're a fan of slasher flicks then this movie is definitely a must-see!5 stars/5"
4,A suprisingly good movie!!!,I have to say that this was a good horror film idea that Wes Craven did justice to! Freddy is a lot more creepier when he's not rambling on with slang and being a smart ass as he does in the sequels.
3,NIGHTMARE,I THOUGHT THIS FIRST NIGHTMARE WAS PREETY GOOD.BUT THE PLOT WAS KIND OF DUMB AT TIMES.FIRST OF ALL THE MAIN CHARECTER NANCY WAS ACTING TO NORMAL AFTER ALL HER FRIENDS DIED.OTHER THAN THAT THE MOVIE WAS PREETY DECENT.
2,"Original, but not necessarily very good","Even though i admit this movie has a very original story and pretty cool special effects i just didnt like this movie very well. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 cause it was alot better than all of those pointless sequals that were yet to come, but it still lacks what all the other horror movies of that time like halloween and friday the 13th had. The story is about a child murderer who was burned to death years back and now returns years later to haught people in their dreams and when he kills you in your dream you die for real. Even though im not a fan of this film i suggest you check it out for yourself especially if your a horror fan."
2,BORING,I REALLY DIDNT CARE FOR THIS MOVIE TOO MUCH. IT STARTED OUT VERY SLOW AND ENDED EVEN SLOWER. ITS OK FOR PEOPLE INTO CLASSIC HORROR. NOT TOO SCARRY.
5,This flick began one of the 80's greatest villians,"While Michael Myers and Jason Voorhees went around killing and slashing their way through horror, Freddy Krueger took a different approach. He's a phantom, ghost like apparatus that is all too real. The ultimate BoogyMan. When you fall asleep, he stalks you. If he kills you in your sleep, you never wake up, cause your dead. This original idea went over well and audiences ate it up. The sequels were hit and miss, but always there was the razor glove, Freddy's classic one liners, and kill scenes that would do Jason and Michael proud. This is the flick that started it all."
4,Depp as Glenn,This is the first movie Johnny Depp was in. His character was named Glenn and he got eaten by a bed. He was lovable and sweet. Go see it just for Johnny.
5,THRASH ICON!!!!,"This movie is a classic and create the absurd thrash cult FRED KRUEGER!!!! This is BY FAR the best one with Fred, a true relevant thrash icon....WAY WAY cooler than Jason..."
5,'Freddy' debuts in this classic horror film,"What's it about?Nancy and her friends have all been having nightmares about the same scary badly burnt boogeyman with razor-blade fingers, turns out he is Fred Krueger a child murderer killed by an angry mob years earlier. Now Krueger is killing Nancy's friends one by one in their dreams and she must find a way to stop him; before she dreams her last dream.Is it any good?Wes Craven's `Nightmare on Elm street' has cemented it's place in horror history. Even though Freddy Krueger became more of a clown sequel by pointless sequel, Robert Englund is truly terrifying here, jumping from one-line dropping funny guy to cold sadistic boogeyman so brilliantly. Truly original, creative and gory as hell `Nightmare' can still hold it's own today.Best bit?Tina in a body bag as a millipede slithers from her mouth; disturbing stuff!Did you know?Over 500 gallons of fake blood were used during the making of this film."
4,Original Nightmare!,Great quality on Blu-Ray but you can tell the movie is 20+ years old. It is a little dated and no longer has the same scare factor.
5,Most horrifying movie ever!!!!,"THis is my faverite horror movie and it has been for 12 years. It frightened mebeyond belief as a child,and to this day I wont watch it alone at night. Wes Craven is a creative genious and deserves more respect than anyone else in the horror industry, because his movie does what other movies only claim to do it actually scares people. This movie is so dark and morbid I was tokin one day in the daytime and i watched this movie I became entranced, and became so scared during the school boiler room scene I had to turn it off. This movie will never be matched by its sequels or any other movie it is a timeless masterpiece. and anyone who says it aint a good movie is right!! Its a great movie, The best of all time. Go get this movie and see what true horror is and should have been."
4,AN EXCELLENT THRILLER FOR WES CRAVEN HIS BEST,I liked A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET it introduces us to one of the most meanacing villans of all time FREDDY KRUGER and what he does which I'm not going to give away just watch and find out. The only complaint I have about this scary thriller is that sometimes overdo's the gore you'll see what I mean when you see it. Anyway this movie is a heck'ava lot better than SCREAM I can't believe both had the same director. If you love being scared you'll love this all-time horror classic.
5,ONE OF THE BEST HORROR MOVIE I EVER SEEN!,"This is a real horror classic directed and written by horrormaster Wes Craven.Nancy Thompson is having terrible nightmares about a guy whos horribly burnt,he has razors on his right hand,and he wears a dirty red and green sweater.That man is Freddy Kruger.She then relizes that her High School pals are also seeing the mysterious man in thier dreams.3 of Nancy's friends got slaughted in thier sleep by the razor loving killer.Now,Nancy must kill the dream stalker before any more lives are torn apart.This is a great movie for a stormy night and espically for Halloween night."
5,A nightmare on elm street,"This movie was good. But it is not my favorite my favorite is Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare. But this I think was the slowest in the series. The dvd is pretty good only a little bit of features like commentary with director wes craven and staff. it has theatrical trailer, and jump to a death.Great dvd.I SPENTED 1 MINUTE AND 50 SECONDS WATCHING THE ONE SPECIAL FEATURE ON THIS DVD"
5,WOW.,"This movie scared the s*** out of me! As soon as I was done watching it, i went to bed cuz it was midnight (I like watching horror movies at night) and I was afraid that a claw was gonna reach from my bed and suck me under! What a fright! YOU MAY NEVER WANT TO DREAM (OR SLEEP) AGAIN!!!!"
3,B Grade B good,I have a soft spot for this movie despite it's shortcomings. The acting from many of the cast is hammy and uninspired but for me this actually adds to the overall dreamlike feel of the movie.The bonus features on Nightmare on Elm Street one are much better than those on the sequels dvds. There is a commentary that includes director Wes Craven and lead actress Heather Langenkamp. For me this is worth the price of the dvd alone. In fact I was shocked to hear that Wes Craven based his idea for the 'Nightmare' franchise on a real phenomenom in Japan where teenagers were too scared to go to sleep and then died during their slumber.Aside from the bonus features this movie is definitely one for the collection of horror fans and is the best in the 'Nightmare' series .
5,AWESOME,"I'm actually 14, but don't want to bother on looking for my dad's password.This movie is awesome, it's funny, creepy, and exciting. I loved the line, ""Hey. Watch this...*SLICE*"" It's hillarious how he has fun with his victims. But it was also very creepy. Robert Englund did an excellent job, I give it 10 thumbs up."
5,Nightmare On Elm Street,"A Nightmare on Elm Street still stands foremost. If the originality of the terror isn't enough, the acting and thought out reactions are simply brilliant. For example, psychologically, Nancy (played by the beautiful Heather Langenkamp) starts to suffer of heavy sleep deprivation, often people think tricks such as the tongue out of the phone and such make no sense since she apparently wasn't asleep; but, anyone that goes that long without sleep will surely hold prominent hallucinations, and will have much difficulty telling reality from fantasy. The movie is perfectly paced, laced together very meticulously, and by the end, makes one demand more."
5,A NIGHTMARE MOVIE THAT WILL GIVE YOU NIGHTMARES !!!,This movie is a true classic and a wonderful start to a neverending saga of Freddy movies. This is the one that started it all. Very supenseful and scary you'll have NIGHTMARES for nights. Kruger is dark and mysterious in this spine tingling horror flick. Great for sleepovers and parties.
2,Don't bother.....,"(Instead of reviewing a film you probably already know, I stick to DVD special features)Those Extras:Commentary: Interesting chat with Craven, Langenkamp, Saxon, and DP Haitkin. Glaring absence is Englund, which loses major points.Overall: Well, that was fun. The audio commentary is even ripped off from the 1994 laser disc release, so this is just BEGGING for a Special Edition. The 20 year anniversary is next year, so stay tuned. Hell, if New Line can trick-out a DVD like Texas Chainsaw III....."
3,Good.,"Wes Craven's used to making good movies. This obviously isn't his best, but it's good. It's entertaining. Worth watching, but can't top SCREAM."
5,Nightmare on Bluray,Great up conversion of an horror classic can't wait for the Nightmare on Elm street 2&3 bundle coming out on bluray in September :)
1,A FARIY TALE ON ELM STREET,This movie was not the least bit scary. The effects where lame and the story line was weak. The ending also made no sense whatsoever. That is why it desearves 1 star
1,made no sense,When I was younger I use to be scared to even watch these films but now that I have watched some of them(this one included) I feel they make no sense at all. Of course if you like the older horror films in the 80's this one will be for you. But I personally think they should have stopped with this movie(just my opinion) If by any chance you have never watched these before and don't know what they're like then rent them first to see if your gonna like them.
1,worst horror film ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"i rented out nightmare coz i woz told that it woz a masterpiece.The blood looked like apple juice, freddy got out smarted which does not usally happen as i have seen sequels 3,4,5. The ending is retarded, the music retro which is rubbishly old. If u r thinking of renting or buying the disasterpiece DONT!"
4,a real nightmare,"This is the movie that children all across America were severely frightened by in the mid 80's. I remember I was in kindergarten in 1986 and I had a dream one night where I was walking through the school parking lot at night by myself, and I heard voices. I noticed Freddy standing beside the school, so I took off running to get away from him but I tripped! I woke up after that. See that? A Nightmare on Elm Street really tormented us children! Back then I KNOW I wasn't the only child afraid to go to sleep after watching this film. It can really get into your head.It's really a fantastic film, too. TRULY the scariest bad guy in the world of horror. You can't go wrong with any of these movies but start with the original."
4,A Gorey Movie,This Was How It All Began And A Little Gorey For Starters But Really Good Movie Seen It In '84 In Therthers And '86 On Video I Love All NOES Movies
4,hello to a new vilain and a new series of flicks,"this movie rocks! not quite as good as halloween but hey I own 2 copies (dont ask) and every horror buff should have atleast 1. the effects are so awesome, better than some stuff today! ceiling scene is classic. oh and my favorite conversation in horror movie history between johnny depp and his mom, depp's sittin with his headfones on watchin tv, his mom comes in and sez: your watching tv with headfones on?"" he sez ""ya, ms. nude america's gonna be on."" she sez, ""well how r u gonna hear what she'll say?"" he sez"" who cares what she sez?"""
3,very original and exciting,"this movie isn't as scary as everybody says but it is very original and for those people who get scared easily I suggest that you don't watch this because it could keep you up for days. it is a very freaky movie. Very original movie with some bad acting, and very unreal dialogue. it's fun though"
4,"Great action, story, and suspense","A Nightmare on Elm Street is a well made horror movie. The villain is menacing, the story is good, and the suspense never lags."
5,ONE TWO FREDDY'S COMING FOR YOU!,"A Nightmare On Elm Street..... need I say more. This film is .....Fu.king fantastic. Excuse the french but this film is the best horror film of all time. When the excellently gifted Wes Craven made this, he created something special that people all over the world would embrace. A highly original film. A killer that everybody knows-Freddy Krueger. I feel like I shouldn't have to write a review on this exciting film. Heather Langenkamp is excellent as Nancy Thompson the heroin in jepody. The great Robert Englund really did something with Freddy- the cruel clown, he relishes in killing. This is a film where it's scary(like when Tina gets killed), the musical score complements the scary atmosphere. The actors are perfectly casted. This film deserves to and is a must have in everybodies DVD collection. The print is good, the commentary by Wes Craven, Heather Langenkamp, John Saxon and Jaques (Haitken) is entertaining. This is one film I'll always love.by Justine Ryan"
4,Nightmare On Elm Street 1...,"The Elm Street series, I think flopped. The first one was a true classic horror film and they tried to use that to continue on doing horrors.In the first one it shows you how Freddy Krueger who lives in the boiler room in secondary school but is only there in teenagers dreams.When one of the girls tells her friends about her weird and terrifying dreams, they realise they were having the same dream. That night, the girl who confessed first was killed in her sleep and her boyfriend who was sleeping in the room with her was blamed.When Nancy realises that Freddy is really there, she has to try and stay awake, but she cant forever...If you like blood, gore and jumpy bits, this film is for you!"
5,Freddy begins,This was the very first Nightmare On elm st. movie. It very well may be the best one! Certainly a classic and should be in everyone's horror collection! See how it all began with Nightmare on elm st.
4,A Frightening Start,"Well, this was the beginning of ""Freddy Kreuger,"" who certainly became famous in the horror movie genre. Of those horror films that spawned numerous sequels (this one, Halloween, etc.) this was the best of the ""opening"" shows. It definitely is frightening.It has the usual crude teenagers, some gratuitous sex and wild Krueger scenes and is probably best-noted for giving us Johnny Depp's film debut. Boy, does he look young! He looks about 16 years old, as does Heather Langenkamp, who went on to play in several more of these ""Nightmare"" stories. It was nice to see Rony Blackley, too.Wes Craven certainly started this series off with a bang."
5,Excellent!,"Tina is having nightmares about a man with a ""dirty brown hat, wearing a red and green sweater, and has knives for fingers"" is trying to kill her. She soon learns that her friends are having the same dream.The best movie out of the seven that was made. Some say the best one is Part 3: Dream Warriors, but this one is much better (Part 3 has bad dialogue). Also, this is the movie where Johnny Depp made his film debut! Along with Part 3: Dream Warriors, and West Craven's New Nightmare (considered as Part 7), This is a MUST own!"
4,great film excellent dvd,this is a great film. it is a 80 s classic. it is only a shame that this is a r rated version of the movie. the dvd is also excellent with some nice extras.
4,Excellent,"Freddy Kruger is a child molestor who was murder by an angery mob after he was released from jail on technicality. And now Freddy is entering the children of the one's who killed him dreams to seek revenge. But Nancy is the only one who takes these nightmares seriously as she sees her friends being killed off one by one. She then decides to defend herself in her own dream and ends up kicking him out of her dream, only to find he is still lurking in the shadows(for the next film, which has nothing to do with the original character except the house the maniac). This is a rare horror movie that gives you a sense of dread and real fear towards Freddy because he is always lurking in the shadows in the entire movie, while the teenage characters don't have a clue who Freddy is and why he is trying to kill them. A must see for anyone!"
5,This movie was great!,"This movie is the best horror movie I ever seen. Altough Robert Englund is not my personley favorit characther, This is the best horror movie ever. Evereybody should see this. The Scene when Nancy (Heather Langenkamp) burns Freddy was the best scene in the movie."
2,"Okay, but no match for Friday the 13th","I saw this movie recently for the first time. I had already seen all 9 Friday the 13ths. This was okay, and it was an interesting concept, but it just wasn't that good. It was neither really scary nor funny. One scene with Johnny Depp's character, near the end, was hilarious, but that was it. It also did not explain how to kill Freddy, and the ending sucked. No offense."
4,"good ,kept me interested. It had a great plot.",this movie was good.Not great but it had a great plot and good acting for a horror flick.I recommend it to anyone who likes horror.The one thing that I did not like was the low death count. But It was saved by Freddie coming back in the end. That might keep you up at night.
4,Still Holds Up,No problems with download. Good picture quality. Nice to share an old favorite with the kids and see their reactions to a horror classic
5,GREAT job remastering this movie on Blu Ray!!!!,This has always been one of my favorite horror movie series. The job done remastering this movie in Blu Ray is EXCELLENT. When you look at it it's like it just came out in theaters in 2011 and on Blu Ray in 2012! It definitely doesn't look like a movie from the 1980's. Amazon's FREE Super Saver Shipping is unbelievable!!! Everytime I've ordered something and chose FREE Super Saver Shipping it always comes 2 or 3 days earlier than the estimated delivery date! The last 2 times I've ordered items and chose FREE Super Saver Shipping they were here 2 days later!! Amazon is the BEST and so is this Blu Ray! If you love Freddy Kruger you'll definitely love watching him in FULL HD on Blu Ray!! I'm very satisfied with this purchase!!
5,a nightmare on elm street,I think this film is a classic and has a lot of spooky stuff.I thought the scene were tina was spinning around with blood comeing out of her was shocking!!!(but great!)
5,bloody fun !!,awesome ! one of my favorite horror flicks...I saw this when it originally came out in the mid 80's as a kid and I was truly frightened...I think the first 3 in the series are the best...With this one being the best the second being good a little confusing but good and the third (dream warriors) being just as good and entertaining as the 1st...A definate classic !!! highly recommend to any horror fan especially the younger horror fans like myself at one time a must see !!!!!
5,Fantastic DVD,"The Infinifilm Edition of A Nightmare on Elm Street is a great way to watch the film. With the branching infinifilm features, you can branch to cool little documentaries. There's also a new commentary track and a text commentary. I watched all three at once. Information overload! Now that it's a lot cheaper it's definitely worth picking up."
5,The Groundbreaker,"A Nightmare on Elm Street is a film that focuses on what happens when people do not communicate well. It preys on the universal fear of the unknown, and what the unknown will bring. This is why ANOES is a classic film.Craven has created a cast of characters that mesh together very well, and of course Robert Englund brings his own style to the archetypal Freddy Kreuger.Additionally, the extras on these DVDs are RAD, there is so much stuff to discover that you'll be watching them for a long time. It also features an option that puts facts up while you're watching the film, you can select the facts and it will then show the bonus feature that accompanies it.Overall, ANOES is the groundbreaker for the series, and many other horror films to follow it. Scared the crap out of me as a kid, and it still does."
2,Not What I Expected.,"In a horror film I expect gore, blood and scary characters. Okay fair enough A Nightmare On Elm Street had all this, but they did'nt use these characteristics to what I expected. I expected this Movie to be a scary movie, yet the movie tended to drag on to a slightly boring plot which led the movie to a disappointing ending.Yes the movie had a story line about a Psychopathic child murderer who kills under 18's in thier sleep on Elm Street, but this very good story line was spoilt by the way the film was set out.Overall not a ""Bad"" movie but not Good movie either."
2,Almost insulting.,"Have we learned nothing from George Romero? Romero tried to teach us (in vain, apparently) that horror movies didn't have to be mindless. They didn't have to be one dimensional. Look at his ""Dead"" trilogy. Those three films (Yes, he ONLY NEEDED THREE) not only had the most gore this side of a Turkish Prison, but they also offered political satire and Romero's views of the world today (for the era in which he made the films, not 1999). That being said, I find all these mindless slasher films (and their countless, desperate money generating sequels) to be insulting in a small way. I'm not trying to turn people off of this film, I'm just ranting. I do that a lot."
2,What a shame,"I bought this product a couple months ago. Initially I was very pleased: A lot of room and pockets, fit my big 'ol laptop.However in the past month its really started falling apart. I'll admit that I'm rough on my bag, but I bought this one expecting durability. The plastic strap clips are busting on me and the telescopic handle just popped off on me when I rolled it over an indentation.Three weeks ago it would have gotten four or five stars (four because I'm not crazy about the sickly gray color of it). Now two, because i did get a couple months of rough use out of it, but i just expected more."
3,An acquired taste,"The death of this artist and recommendations from acquaintances who described him as a ""jazz singer"" led me to pick up this CD. The immediate impression is that the production values are overdone--even to the point of distracting from what seems to be a richly expressive baritone. And when he goes for a Sinatra-style standard (""How About You""), swing is the furthest thing from his mind.I suspect that Lucien should not be judged by the usual standards. He's not simply a singer with accompaniment. He's a tone-colorist, the creator of a total soundscape of which his voice is simply one component. The instrumentation, arrangements, textures, and even most of the songs are his as much as the voice. To the listener who has the time and patience, there could be significant payloads in Lucien's music that require repeated listenings and some adjustment of the criteria by which we usually respond to a ""jazz singer."""
2,Decent writing but confusing thesis,"This had the potential to be a good book and Huxley certainly wasn't a bad writer for his day, but his main purpose in this book seems to be to get a message out, and I'm not sure I can buy that message. Basically the thesis is that it's good to be unhappy. The main characters are sick that this world has no unhappiness and they want the right to be unhappy. I cannot understand this since I would rather be happy than not. If this was just a satire about an immoral modern society, then I could understand. His predictions certainly are not too far off the map. If you are curious, try this book, but personally I did not find it enlightening."
3,could be so much more,"In this book there seems to be something missing. I love the world Huxley creates, but he goes for the obvious. In other words, I could tell where the book was going to go when Bernard suggested taking the Savage to the real world. There is so much more that Huxley could have done with the world he creates. I should say that when I first finished the book I probably would have given the book 4 or 5 stars. However, after thinking about the book for a few days I realized this is a 3 to 3 1/2 star book."
2,1984? I don't think so. Brave New World is weak.,"I read Brave New World because I really liked 1984 and some people recommended it as similar. I really have to dissagree. Whereas 1984 had a plot, characters and a point Brave New World had none. It is basically a description of a futuristic world with this bit thrown in about The Savage. The Savage is a strange combination that Heller made up of religion, primative life, and something like voodoo. Not a very impressive book."
5,Revealing,"Aldous Huxley's work in Brave New World is really earth-shaking, I believe. No one has more acutely stated the problems of today's society than Huxley, and the scary part about it, is that he did it 60 years ago. In my day to day life I see unsettling ghosts of the brave new world as it approaches. Think about it, with cloning now, genetic engineering, and our ever increasing consumption of drugs. It won't be long before we're popping soma and conditioning artificial children. Truly a mind-expanding read. I would recommend it to anyone that has ever been angry with society."
5,If you enjoy biting satire. . .,"I am delighted to have come across another satirical novel written in the same fashion, THE LAST DAY, by Glenn Kleier. In THE LAST DAY, Kleier tackles the subject of authority in organized religion with outrageous wit and irreverence. LAST DAY is a classic, watershed novel in the manner of BRAVE NEW WORLD. I found it a riveting read, and one that I greatly encourage all Huxley fans to experience"
5,Best Book Ever!,"It is completely effective, despite the fact that there are about 3 million copies of it. The last lines chilled me. READ it now! Oh, and to the people who said we are TURNING into brave new world; there have always been extreme social classes- why don't we focus on out-of-control technology instead? Hope no one saw that NBC tv-movie about this book. It was so commercialized and had so little to do with what the book is about, it was painful to watch. Buy the real thing! If you are literate and are somewhat intelligent, you should love it!"
4,Very Interesting View of The Future,"I really liked this book, although there were some parts to it that I didn`t understand. The author creates a future world, where humans are genetically engineered to ""be happy"". I think the idea behind this book is to point out some of the weaknesses of our society (eg. our reluctance to face our problems - we tend to take some ""soma"" instead, which is a widely used drug in the book to make people forget their problems)and to make us aware of what could happen in the future to humanity if we aren`t careful. The future described in the novel is very realistic and some of it is already starting to show up - whether we like it or not. When reading the book, you get the feeling (or maybe you don`t) that something is wrong with this future world. Engineering people to work and be happy is wrong, because the happiness they are feeling is not real. I guess it doesn`t make any sense now, but after reading the book it gives you something to think about. A great book!"
5,An amazing book on the subject of censorship.,"A truly thought-provoking book. It makes you realize the price of giving up truth and beauty for ignorant bliss. A painful honest, unlimited world will always be superior to content sheltering in my mind. ""Those who give up freedom for the privilege of safety deserve neither."" Let's just hope to the world doesn't end up in the state of the one described in BNW, a not completely unlikely possibility."
2,Disappointment,"Once again a book that garners acclaim but leaves you (me anyway) feeling like you wasted precious moments of your life--ala On The Road. But, you deserve to see for yourself and be the final judge and jury. I give the guy a five for creativity though. I did not find the romantic aspects stimulating, although they could've been."
3,"Not as interesting as 1984 and WE, but still a good book.","I found this book to be far less intriguing than the other two negative-Utopias. Dealing with a world full of predestined drones, the book tells the story of a savage who is introduced to the ""new"" and ""happy"" world, and is forced to make a choice between it and a life of solitude.I found the characters a bit unrealistic, almost forced into their unfitting surroundings, but the story was meaningful and didactic. I would still recommend it as a worthy glance into the future."
4,Interesting!,"This book is moralistic and unique, the characters are comparable to Bradbury's and the overall feel is that the plot is all to plausible, all to possible-- waiting to happen, just around the bend. To tell the simple truth, it gave me the creeps."
4,Captivating Contemporary Classic!,"Many people have told me that this novel is a bit outdated. I found the book to be slow, yet strangely fascinating in the beginning, and captivating by the middle. It is a classic examination of social ills and evils that affect us now and will continue to affect us in the future. I would recommend it to any senior high school or college student who is selecting a literary work to read for English class. It is also great beach reading, but you need to concentrate on the plot and information in the book, so no dozing off!"
3,Brave New World,"Aldous Huxley has some pretty caustic observations to share about industrial society in this futuristic novel. In his Brave New World, happiness is the supreme good, industry and science have made happiness possible for all, and as a result mankind is diminished. Most of the book was rather slow going for me but the ""trial"" scene where the Controller explains himself to the Savage was worth sticking around for. I also enjoyed reading how a writer of the 1930s imagined technology 600 years hence: people traveling in helicopters and rocket planes, going to the ""feelies"" for entertainment, and so on."
2,Bland,"A prophetic vision of a distant future, where humans are hatched, and choice is a thing of the past. Brave New World describes a regimented, worldwide government where men and women are bred into a particular caste, and conditioned from infancy to appreciate their lives as workers and consumers. Sometimes it seemed an attack against communism, at other times a treatise on `stability with happiness' versus `instability with human struggle.' Regretfully, the characters were unlovable, and at times seemed barely human. The struggle against the government turned out to be not much of a struggle at all, more of a polite conversation with some tears. There was no fear or darkness, and only a little bit of contention. Towards the end, the characters turned didactic, quoting Shakespeare and waxing scholarly. It made the story feel more like an essay than a book. For a touching futuristic tale of governmental intrusion, read Orwell's 1984 instead."
5,Just as relevant now as then,"When I began reading it, I must admit I expected a certain datedness and heavy-handed writing style. Many literary classics, although thematically fascinating, can be ponderous. Just take a look at the intense verbosity of Victorian authors (who were paid by the word, mind you), and you'll know what I mean. Brave New World isn't like that, though. The prose is light, even airy at times, and engulfed me swiftly. It was only toward the denouement that the words became heavy, but by that time, I'd been inured to the writing style.It's quite amazing how the book is as relevant today as it was when it was written. Perhaps a couple of the futuristic devices seem quaint (and the lack of atomic energy a little odd, yet not offputting), but the science is artfully vague enough that current technology can easily fill the gaps.I can see echos of the book in all sorts of utopian literature and film: from Orwell's 1984 to Zardoz. Good job, Mr. Huxley!"
3,VISIONARY commentary on technology vs. democracy. WOODEN as a novel.,"I was tremendously eager to read Brave New World. It is a legendary book, and its thoughts on the future have continued to illuminate the present, decades later. On that score the book is brilliant and visionary. However, AS A NOVEL it tastes like cardboard. The characters are hollow and the plot is clumsy. Fortunately it is a short book, and fortunately, Huxley's remarkable insights carry you through to the end. Still, given that it is a novel, I have to downgrade it for its clumsy design. I ended up reading this more as a historical document, rather than for its literary style. That said, lower your expectations, and plunge in. Huxley was a man of remarkable foresight and one with a keen eye to the social dilemmas posed by technology."
5,a classic novel,The book is a classic novel. High school students love this book. They can't believe the prophetic element to the novel.
3,Huxley really isn't a novelist,"I always enjoy Orwellian novels and those on dystopias, and though BNW was worth reading to see Huxley's view on a bad path, I found the substance of the novel seriously lacking. It lacked a main plot pulling the whole thing together. He jumped around from protagonist to protagonist, leaving you begging for him to settle on one dissenter, but instead all you get is four or five wishy-washy ones. Take a gram of Soma before reading this one."
2,"Overrated, underwritten","I do not understand at all what everyone is raving about. Mediocre writing, snail-like pacing, and shallow stereotypes (the semi-rebellious anti-hero, the hard-core Messiah/revolutionary figure, the orthodox romantic interest, the benevolent omnipotent despot are Bernard, Savage, Lenina and Mond, respectively) aside, the idea of this book is absurd. Sure, the denizens of Huxley's Ford-ruled world (and the replacement of ""God"" with ""Ford""; I found that amusing for, oh, about three seconds) seem perfectly happy to me, and the book is written in such a cock-eyes and unbelievable manner that this ""Brave New World"" doesn't seems at all depressing; it just seems like another way to live life. This is a crushingly pointless book."
4,A Must Read,"Many people these days worry about our society turning into the nightmare of George Orwell's 1984. However, I believe that the apathy of Brave New World is much more likely... The government is going to pleasure us into submission?.. Doesn't seem that far off."
4,Amazing Foresight,"I'm fascinated how an authors writing reflects the times they are living in. This book was published in 1932 after being exposed to WWI, the Great Depression, and the rise of political ISM's. He hits the nail on the head by showing that even with so called ""utopian society"" not every one is happy. What is the old axiom - ""You can't please all the people all the time."" This book is a very good read; but, tries to tackle to many issues all at once.Not that it doesn't make a good story; but, I find it peculiar that all of the authority figures are male and the women are moronic materialistic sex objects (which I can point to several examples in todays society). The most disturbing issue to me was the idea that if a woman got pregnant the ""father"" was able to cast her off to the savages with no remorse."
3,"Decent read, overly detailed?","Most of my peers read this in high school. I somehow managed to get away with not reading it. A friend suggested it as I had just finished ""The Hunger Games"" trilogy and was looking for something different to read.ProsGiven the book was written in early 1900's it is amazing that you can still picture a ""future"" situation from the situations he talks aboutLots of details about the day to day things and how life is treatedConsOverly detailed book leads to only a semi climatic ending.Did not leaving me wanting to reread it, everI read the book and I can see why some would say it is overrated. I can also see why some proclaim it as a masterpiece. I believe for the period written it was brilliant and yet so scandalous. The idea of a ""lower being"" being one that believes in a God and does not follow the lifestyle of the autonomous is rather interesting. I read a book for the climax and ending. This book built up so much about the ""new world"" but ended with a ""pfffft""."
3,"Either out of my class, or outclassed by 1984","Maybe I was not in right frame of mind when I read the novel, or I should not have read Orwell's 1984 so soon before, but I found Huxley's novel too tedious, complex, subtle and unengaging. By itself, BNW would be a 5 star novel, however compared to 1984, it just does not match up. Its character development, character relationships... are too odd, weak and unbelievable. Its technological jargon is perplexing, and so on. It was not a completely horrific novel, but not the best.Perhaps one day, when I am in my 20's... 30's or 40's, I shall pick up another copy and just adore it. Perhaps."
2,"Actually, not that good.","The characters are irritating and one-dimensional. The too frequent shifting points of view are unnecessary and confusing. Aside from the occasional glimmers of dry wit (not including the ""Our Ford"" joke which tires out quickly), the writing is for the most part flat. Even the orgy scenes manage to be dull. The latter half of the novel is simply a rant of Huxley's personal beliefs, all of which have been stated elsewhere and more eloquently. There are no real deep societal insights. In short, extremely overrated."
5,Amazing.....,"It is rather rare for a work to so capture me that I read it cover-to-cover in one sitting - this is one such work. One is left with the sickening feeling that we are living in the time that leads up to the ""Brave New World"". The destruction of the middle-class and the result being that far too many citizens of low intelligence and lacking in intellectual curiosity now find themselves unemployed or in positions of employment that allow far too much time for ""thought"". The Tea party, FOX News, et al - the inmates are taking over the asylum and one fears how they will be stopped."
1,A Silly Premise,This book has been held up as a comparable to Orwell's 1984. It's not. Huxley is just trying to write about a lot of sexual intercourse and still get published in a previous era. There in no serious discussion of the societal woes that are the subject of the book until the final short chapter.
3,Boring,This is overrated the book is boring as hell. I wouldn't recommend it to someone unless they were forced to read for a class.
3,Better then most science fiction,Unlike some authors I could mention Albous Huxley at least sets his futureistic novel in THE ACTUAL FUTURE not the mid eighties (20 years ago). I like this book because it shows a time when its the future and everyone is happy all the time and technology is advanced.There is also a good message here that no matter how good things get there will always be some negative nellies who are never satisfied. SO TRUE!I could do without so much drugs and sex in a book but I guess you gotta put that in there if you want to sell a million copies. Next time try haveing dinosaurs instead. It has worked before for some authors!FIVE stars for the idea minus ONE star for the sex minus ONE star for no dinosaurs. That means THREE STARS (pretty good)!
1,Disgusted,If this is the future i hope its far off :P all though it was a little bit interesting some parts.
5,A Seminal Work,"Huxley paints an unflattering picture of the future. He reminds us of the terrible things that could follow if we begin to meddle to much with our own destiny. I can only say that this book will change you, and that you should pick it up."
1,The ultimate in idiocy,"A world where nobody is unhappy... this is supposed to be a bad thing in Huxley's story. What nonsense.I find it strange that Huxley supposedly had any affinity towards buddhism... The ultimate goal in buddhism is the ending of suffering... other things... freedom, love etc... are unimportant next to this. To say that you want to ""keep the right to be unhappy"" (as one of the characters in the book says) is the most unbuddhist thing anyone could say...What stupidity... taking pride in your ability to be unhappy..."
1,oh my Ford!!,"I hate this book. It is very poorly written, the story is almost laughable (""feelies"" ""orgy-porgy"" WTF), the language is dry, etc. etc. i wouldn't even give it 1 star..."
1,might be the worst book ever written,"huxley's brave new world is a story about the future world and how messed up it will be. 'civilization', as it is called in the novel, is all about sacrificing art, love, and beauty for artificial happiness.the plot was slow to pick up from the start [and, actually, it never did pick up] and very confusing. it was also a very dirty book and a dark portrayal of the future world. in the novel, all humans are created in embryo factories, babies are hypnotized and given electric shocks, children are taught erotic play, and everyone is constantly high on a drug named soma. the book's vivid descriptions of sex, drugs, and violence really make you wonder what kind of man huxley was.aside from my personal prejudices, the story itself was pretty lame in that NOTHING HAPPENED. what huxley provided us with was a 300-page description of the ""future"".not much of a satire and not very witty either."
4,New World Order,"3 1/2 StarsReplace soma with television, harvest centers with embrionic stem cell research and controllers with the United Nations and you know where we stand right?This is a very light and entertaining book that will only take a few hours to finish, but you will think about it for many more. Its dystopian entertainment value more than makes up for its simplistic writing style."
5,Fantastic,"Fasinating book, so insightful about what the future my hold. I enjoyed this book, the plot is interesting and the social commentary is thought provoking."
4,Classic,The classic Huxley story in handy paperback. My kids needed it for school. Didn't we all? A great hand-me-down. Check it out.
2,Incoherent and absentminded.,This book has many good thought inducing ideas as well as an amazingly provocative plot. The only problem is starting the book and some of the more gnarled chapters. When starting the book you have to get in to the correct frame of mind. The book does not do this for you. My other grievance is with one chapter. The style in which it is written makes the reader work relatively hard to concentrate on what is being said.
2,not that great,"What's good about it is Huxley's vision - who cares if it's plausible or not so plausible, because it's interesting and vivid, and that's enough. If you want to evaluate the plausibility of it, fine, but the result has little bearing on the quality of the novel. That said, everything else about ""Brave New World"" is mediocre. The plot seems convinient (not to mention boring), and once a few chapters have passed, Huxley just ceases development of his vision to instead focus attention on characters - who end up being underdeveloped anyway.(If you haven't read it yet, I still suggest you read it, and judge for yourself. But I wouldn't buy it.)"
5,Much better than the movie,"For those of you who saw the NBC version of this, the book is much better! While the movie had that sappy ending, the book cuts no punches. I'm 15, and I think I grasped this book pretty well, so anybody, and everybody can, and should read this book! Very good!"
3,Brave New World,I had to read this book in English and it took me forever to read. I liked how this book made me think to things I never really thought about (does that make sense?). Yeah I don't usually like the books I am forced to read in class. This book was okay.
5,this is of course a masterpiece!!,"really no need to write sth about this ""cult"" novel... in a couple of years everything written by this genius man will come true..i should say this book was the reason why i studied molecular biology and genetics for four years..and it turned out to be the only thing i can work on...to clone myself...(maybe FBI will read this and i will be dismissed from the scientific community hehe:)) i wouldnt care the least...i ordered this by amazon.com coz i couldnt find the complete original text in Turkey unfortunately..this invaluable work of art will stay next to another breakthrough work of art by Orwell, of course 1984, in my library...where would i be now if i hadnt met these i dont know...(the explicit lyrics by PULP!! those of you will remember:))"
2,Give me Orwell any day.,"After checking out this book because I'd heard it compared on the same level as Orwell's 1984, Brave New World was a dreadful disappointment. Why people think it's so great, I'd really like to know. Maybe I missed something. But to me, it seemed like a great premise that never went anywhere. It completely fizzled and died about 2/3 of the way through. Huxley couldn't decide what storyline he wanted to use, and finally picked the silliest, most childish one. He also had trouble figuring out which of his characters was the protagonist. First it was Lenina, then it was her lover (I forget his name), then it was the ""savage"", and so forth. So, yes, Huxley and Orwell have written books with similar ideas. The only difference between the two is that Orwell carries off his storyline in a mature and captivating manner, like a true writer."
3,Not as good as it should have been,"Brave New World is full of interesting ideas, from an embryo production centres and ""hypnopaedia"" to encouragement of promiscuity and partying for social stability. But it doesn't have a plot to put it all together. It only creates a world but not a story. And the ending is so anticlimatic that after the ending, when one turns the page, one thinks ""That's it?!"". However, it is the only complete science fiction book I've read, because it has scientific, political, and philosophical ideas, all together.I'd reccommend 1984 more than this book."
3,This Brave New world needs better writers,"This book is inevitably compared to 1984, with good reason. But this book lags behind 1984 in the literary sense.Make no mistake. Huxley was a genius. He was far ahead of his time and had many ideas about the future that have become real. But the problem with the book is his writing.Orwell is such a fantastic writer that, while you shudder at the bleak vision he has for the world, you become more interested in the characters of the book. Huxley's characters are just props. Huxley felt like sharing his ideas, but he couldn't just write about them. It seems like he just inserted the characters in so that there would actually be some in the book. Without good characters, a book seriously lags. If Huxley had just been a better writer, the book would be worthy of the comparisons to 1984 that it always recieves."
1,Woe of the World,"I had read this book as a required reading in college (many years ago) and I had forgotten how dismal I thought it was back then. My view has not changed. It give credence to the suggestion that a group of monkies hammering away at a bevy of typewriters could somehow produce a work of this sort. It appears that Huxley simply entered random words on paper as they popped up in his brain(?). Brave New Worlds, indeed.I would suggest reading Mad Magazine instead."
2,Brave New World,"Brave New World is boring at the beginning, but it becomes more interesting later. I wouldn't recommend the book for everyone because it is very suggestive. I am reading it in my senior English class. This book has so much immorality that it shouldn't be allowed in schools. The book has good points and reveals problems in any society, but that doesn't mean that just because it is educational that it should be used in a school setting. I would suggest that if the book would interest someone they may want to read it on their own time, and not for a school class."
3,Scary but true.,Bought for a school assignment. Read it; and was kinda grossed but laughed at most of the things supposebly scary. eh im just demented.
4,It's all about ME!,"I liked this book, however there were some parts that I didn't like. There was also other parts such as a Sexual Scene between two of the Characters. This scene seem werid, the story of the book was very intersting. It was very fictional, to the degree of Matrix fictional. I personalilty prefer books that does not bring fiction to such a high degree, and is more realistic.If you are thinking about wether or not to read the book then think about this. What movie would you rather watch? The Matrix, Praties of the Carrdein or any SCI FCI movies? or The Itian Job, Ocean 12, and action movies? If you chosed Matrix then you should read this book. If you do not want to Hear Sci-Fci infornation which is inrelaved to today's socity then this book is not for you- P Tran"
2,Huh....,"So anyways, I picked this book up thinking it would be an interesting tale about the future and totalitarianism. While it was about that, I found it difficult to find a plot. Aldous Huxley kind of rambles for a hundred pages, and then he introduces what then becomes the main character, Mr. Savage. He then quickly wraps it up in a crazy crazy way that was not at all what I expected it to be like. Normally surprises are good, but this was one of the crappiest books I have ever read, good night."
1,Not a great sci-fi book,"This science fiction novel seemed to lack the credibility of many other sci-fi books around now. Huxley's incredibly boring and unrelatable characters gave me the urge to yell ""STOP WHINGING!"""
4,Thought-provoking,"Before looking up info on the book, I thought it must have been written during the hippie era, warning about what might happen if the government took control of our lives. The book is insightful, the characters' thoughts and feelings changing dramatically over the course of the story. The characters start out satisfied with their lives in ""civilization"", where humans no longer have to deal with sexual reproduction---babies are made in factories, and there are distinct ranks and advantages among the people as they grow older. Upon meeting more people, and experiencing more of the so-called uncivilized section of the world, the characters begin to wonder if ""civilized society"" is as great as it is supposed to be...Also very thought-provoking, as it explores a world none of us have ever known, and probably don't want to know."
1,Just wanted to get your attention:),"I've read this book about ten times in my life since my dad gave it to me in Junior High-it is a fantastic book, and the ideas expressed in the book are timely even today. If you ever read one book in your life, this should be the book."
1,This book has no substance.,"This book is supposed to show conern for a utopian society, which apprenly does not involve animals. If there is no science then how are the reasearchers able to come up with new maturing speeds.The story itself is horrible since nothing exciting ever happens and the author does not let the reader wondering whats going to happen next in this situation becuase the end of the book and the beggning of the book are not related that closely. Its as if i was reading the beggning of the book over and over again and nothing ever progressed.To prove a point, this book should onl be read by belivers of a utopian society or people who fear it and can beleive in this one. In other words, no one read this book becuase it is not beleiveable."
5,An Important and Chilling Message - Even Today!,"This book is well worth anyone's time to read. In it Huxley outlines what he thinks is going to happen to his world long into the future. It is almost uncanny how some of the things that he prophesies have occurred or are occurring in the present day. He talks about a world influenced by scientists and sociologists. He even mentions cloning! (Remember this book was originally written in 1931). What most people don't realize though is that Huxley thought his book was a comic book. Even though he thought it comic, he was still trying to put forth his forebodings for the world's future and for each individual's right to freedom. A sobering, but highly entertaining read."
5,Wow.,I read Brave New World in my grade 12 English class but am EXTREMELY glad that I had too. the book was mind blowing. Huxley is my new favorite author! For anyone who likes society the way it is this book will be an insult. I love the sadistic humour that Huxley shows. The novel is over the top and frighteningly realistic. Huxley is a genius. I'll be reading more of his stuff in the future.
4,Brave New World nowhere as deep as 1984,"Aldous Huxley's 1932 novel Brave New World presents a vision of consumerism and mechanization, where social strata are bred into the biology of factory-produced twins, and stuporous stability is the highest government ideal. I found myself captivated by the book's system of society, its veneration of Henry Ford, and culture of instant gratification. If Orwell's vision was pure fascism, this is pure capitalism.On the downside, Brave New World is nowhere as intellectually deep as 1984. The plot and characters are underdeveloped and inconsequential. Huxley makes the joy of reading solely in its exploration of his (brave new) world, but that can only carry the book so far. Throw in a compelling plot, differentiated tone of story-telling, and dynamic characters and it might have been perfect.[...]"
2,An OK Novel,"I didn't really enjoy reading this book too much. The main characters were annoying, and the writing style was unnecessarily confusing. The only redeeming quality to the book was the valid and interesting points on civilization as a whole. Many reasonable problems were brought up, and not only brought up, but answered as well. Overall, it is not even close to the best books I've read, but it is far from the worst."
3,Huxley = Genius?,"Is Brave New World actually all that much of a brilliant book, complete with social implications? Absolutely.Is Aldous Huxley a prophet? By no means.Although his ideas are genuine and the book is extremely well-written, and altogether hilarious, Huxley makes the assumption that there will never be any kind of social or political opposition to this type of a society. He makes the Brave New World too outrageous, too unbelievable to think that society would ever come to such a point, and indeed, it hasn't, isn't now, and never will. Perhaps liberal ideology is flawed, but democracy and the fact that there is opposition to the liberal ideas always preclude the implications Huxley asserts.So.. read Brave New World. Enjoy It. It may change your life, but never consider Aldous Huxley a prophet in any sense."
2,Oh so overrated,"Try as I might, I just don't get the appeal of the Utopia/Dystopia genre. With it's idealistic philosophies and overdrawn characters, it leaves much to be desired by the realist. This book, who's plot is well known enough that I do not think I need to delve into it here, is very indicative of the whole genre. All of the characters are cardboard cutouts of the denziens of the utopian novel. There's the bewildered outsider, there's the one who can't accept the system, there's the one who accepts it whole heartedly, there's the victim of said society, etc, etc, etc. Yes, the book does raise important objections to the Totalitarian state and religious fidelity to science, however, these are actually fairly common objections that you do not need to read a 250 page book to figure out. If you loved 1984, give it a shot I guess. Otherwise, just read some critiques of Communist(and to a lesser extent, state capitalist) ideology."
2,Hits on predicting the future but doesn't everyone,I really did not like the book. The author got somethings right about things today. But anybody predicting the future gets something right.I was bother by the lack of God in the book.
2,Shrug,"While going through my stack of unread books this summer I noticed that I still had a copy of this book from High School, at the moment I am two semesters from graduating from college. So, I figured I should read it as I am an English major and most English majors have read this book.Why I bothered I do not know.The plot to this book was poorly executed, the characters were weak and I just didn't really care.Instead I suggest ""1984"" by Orwell or ""We"" by Zamyatin, if you are interested in this topic. Especially ""We"" as it was written before either or these two books and is my personal favorite, but is tragically ignored."
4,How do I do 20 words on a book?,"I read ""Brave New World"" when I was in high school, and now, over 50 years later, I wanted to read it again. Yup! I got the book I wanted. It isn't in the best of shape, but it's readable and it's what I wanted. What's to complain about?? I think ""1984"" was more pungent and foretelling! There. Is that 20 words?? Have a great day!! Talk to your Savior Jesus! Thank Him!"
5,The original anti-eutopia.,"This is Huxley's masterpiece--the original anti-eutopia of Western literature, and the best. Setting the anti-technology standard carried through by cumming's poetry and Orwell's prose a half-generation later, Huxley adopts a sensationalist, slightly racy stance toward his subject matter: technology vis-a-vis power. True to his cinematographic experience (Huxley later turned to film writing), this book is part tabloid, part far-fetched sci-fi, and all fun. It's a literary masterpiece to boot, with substance to back up the style. A must read! Buy it today!--Justin Laird Weaver"
4,An orderly world of labratory produced babies exists.,"It is amazing how Aldous Huxley created a conditioned society 70 years ago, that reflects so much of what is going on in the world of 1999. John Savage's character represents a hopelessness that art, literature, and religion are to be extint and have no place in a secure pleasure seeking environment."
3,A Classic but not much payoff,A Classic but not much payoff...It's worth a listen or a read. It's unfortunately a little dry and not quite as exciting as some of it's peers.
2,Like 1984 but worse,"I found that the idea behind a Brave New World was intresting, but the book itself was pretty boring. Brave New World is a lot like 1984. For example it dealt with society in the feature and described a totalatarian government. Except in Brave New Wold there is not much of a story line and you never get to know the characters. The whole book is pretty much just describing how their society is run. Another poroblem I found with this book is that there is never a climax and nothing exciting happens. I was pretty disappointed after reading because it had the potential to be so much better."
2,john becker's review,"This book was very confusing for me. It started out very slow and didnt introduce the main characters till the middle of the book. It reminds me of the book ""1984"". It takes place in the future and most everyone is under control ecept for the people with free minds live on resirvations. They keep the people under control with a drug called ""soma"". It drugs them so they dont know whats going on. I do not recommend this book to anyone [...]"
4,Pretty good...,"I didn't have anything to do and this book was laying around at work so I read it for a couple days (and finished it). I didn't even realize it was written in the 30's until about halfway through when I checked the copyright date, I just thought it was written in England or something.It's about an alternate future where people are born in labs and live their life like drones (kinda like the original The Time Machine). You've gotta have an open mind if you're gonna read this because it could be seen as controversial with all the lab babies and drugs and stuff. But, overall, yeah, if it's sitting there and you have nothing to do go for it!"
3,Somewhat dated,"Although artfully written, the work is a bit long winded for shorter novel. The references are dated and take a little bit to get into the correct mindset to enjoy. It plays out better in your head than it does on "" paper "". The story though makes up for any shortcomings and leads the reader along an intriguing story of a world in which social happiness trumps personal independence and starts the thought prices of "" is there to much of a food thing""."
2,Brainy but sterile narrative - I much preferred 1984,"Extremely boring in many stretches. Really, it's more an exposition of a future possible state, with archetypes instead of characters, and long, highly technical descriptions of factories and flying machines. Don't look for subtle emotions or subtle anything here - I guess that wasn't the point.For a dystopian novel, I'd highly recommend Orwell's 1984 instead.But two stars for Brave New World's prescience and the obvious smarts of its author, and that affecting scene of the conditioning of the Delta babies (poor things!).Lastly, I am surprised this is required reading for many English classes - it could really turn off students to dystopian literature."
3,Brave New World,"I first read this book back in high school, about '75 and remembered it as being quite ""weird"", so now I am working in the school for the last ten years that I graduated from and the kids are reading it and really talking about it so I re-read it, still ""weird"" I can see why it was banned for a while. Strong character going through tough times."
5,Work of art,"If you are looking for one of those books that really is one of the ""foundations"" of science fiction then Brave New World is for you. Brave New World is set in the future when humanity has attempted to create an utopian society. It is bizarre and somewhat chilling experience, especially if you look at society today. The foreward is excellent, because it really places the book into historical context...and yes (sadly)this is the book that Tom Cruise ranted about on the Today show. Overall, an impressive book. Would be a great college freshmen novel."
4,An Interesting Read,"The first time I ever read Brave New World, I thought it was quite a confusing book. I couldn't understand the structure of the society described and why the characters did the things they did. Now that I am older, I have a much better understanding of what was being described in the novel. The importance of individualism and being naturally human is implied in the story. John the Savage may be the perfect example of how real humans would react to such a negative society as described in the book. Aldous Huxley was a genius in his ability to incorporate such philosophical arguments into a story that people of all ages could enjoy.Zachary B. MedinaAuthor of Decador"
4,Great book!,"I bought this book for my English lit class,I'm a first year college student and it arrived within 3 days in perfect condition. i would resell it but my bf spilled latte all over it!!"
5,Scary thought,This is one of my favorite books. The scary thing is it is becoming more and more reflective of today's society.
5,Is This The Future?,"In a soulless future world, genetic engineering programmes people from birth for their status in society, and removes all aggressive or unproductive instincts. Individuality, creativity and personality are sacrificed in the causes of material prosperity, good health and freedom from anxiety. Only a small group of ""savages"" - people like us - survives, in a community in New Mexico, and one of them escapes and is brought into the ""real world"", with tragic results. As in all his novels, Huxley tells his tale soberly and without comment: the flatness of his prose brilliantly intensifies the horror of what he is saying. Nothing truly terrible happens - and that is the most terrifying thing of all."
5,Entertaining,A great book that gives a glimpse into what the elites have in store for America. Very close to reality how the elites want control of DNA and the world. They accomplish this goal through conditioning of it's citizens which is evident in today's society.
4,Interesting to say the least.,"Enjoyed this read, with everything that is going on in the world,especially our country,it makes complete and total sense. Lot of what I think is considered old English but thanks to the kindle dictionary was able to manage. There are a few words that are totally made up, but as long as you're paying attention it is understandable."
1,Plotless Wonder,Huxley made a great setting. That's about all that's great. The novel had no plot and little character development. It's definitely not worth reading by choice. I think that a better writer could have developed the first few chapters into a wonderful storyline given the chance.
1,Not all it's cracked up to be,"Brave New World has many thought-provoking ideas. To dream up an utopia in Huxley's time is genious, but the story is not. I read this story for eighth grade, and though it had some things that i'm sure no one had ever thought of before then, they have now. It's not good enough to have a good ides, you have to write well, too."
2,BORING.. OUTDATED...,"The writer created a new style. It is not futuristic: it should be called ""surealistic fiction"". The book is boring, the general portrait of the future is very brief and full of lacunes, one of the characters spent most of the book just quoting Shakespeare. The ending is absurdly weak; well, it's a trip with no destination at all. It is just boring. I bought thinkin it was a classic, but it is just boring."
1,I hated this book! It was torture to read it!,"I thought this book was boring and pointless. I was forced to read it for school, and I hated every minute of it"
1,Scared the s__t out of me,Your worst nightmare.Look into the eyes of a gridlocked friend.Do you need soma (sic)?
1,thought i'd like it,"i really enjoyed 1984, so i figured BNW was another book i'd like. sadly, i didn't enjoy it. dystopia novels just may not be my thing."
1,Poor characters,This novel is flawed about the science and the people. It portrays the male characters poorly. Not recommended for scientists and writers.
4,Disturbing,"My high school AP English teacher's favorite phrase was: ""Good literature entertains. Great literature disturbs."" This is surely the case with Aldous Huxley's ""Brave New World,"" especially today. Even though it is many decades after this book was written, some of the forecasted changes in society have chillingly been fulfilled. In addition to serving as a warning against the dangers of submitting to authority, the book contains many interesting and thought-provoking ideas about freedom and the nature of the individual. I, like the Savage, was especially disturbed by the caste system of Alphas, Betas, Gammas, Deltas, and Epsilons and the unnatural similarities of the Bokanovsky Groups."
4,A history of what may expect us,"Brave new world if one of those books that leave you thinking... what if your social status had been previously decided? What if you didn't have parents or children? What if marriage was a dirty word? This is a story about a society where everything has been planned for the common good. A place where human beings are bred to meet production requirements and divided into social casts. It is a happy world where everyone belongs to everyone else. In case you feel bad, you always have ""soma"", the government sponsored drug that will make you forget reality.But even such a ""perfect"" environment has room for chaos at the ""savage reservations"". Those are places where men and women live in the wilderness, where they still have children and marry. Where they strive to survive, fight and kill. Where they are free..."
3,This book got me thinking about the future.,"Brave New World was an interesting book that I definitely think was worth reading. I enjoyed reading every minute of it, yet sometimes it was confusing. At the beginning I didn't always understand what was going on. This book really makes you think about the future, and what it might be like in the years to come. It's so weird to hear the characters talking about how horrible our era is. They found the old people at the indian reservation disgusting because they never age. How strange in this day and age. I find the book very odd, but I'm very glad I read it for English class."
3,Frightening Look at Utopian Society,"Considered a classic in apocalyptic literature, Brave New World was received to negative reviews when it was published in 1932. This book examines a 2540 utopian society who accepts promiscuous sex and drug use. The forward thinking author creates a carefree, technologically advanced society, produced by genetically bred humans who obey the ruling order passively. The drug ""soma"" is designed to keep one perpetually calm and happy. In other words, ignorance is bliss. The frightening premise suggests that the individuality and human ambition will be sacrificed for harmony in society.Incidentally, the use of ""For the love of Ford"" injected some humor into the dialogue.Reviewed by Holly Weiss, author of Crestmont"
5,WOW.,"Brave New World is, if not my very favorite book, is probably within the top three. I learn or notice or glean something new from it every single time I read it, and at this point I've read it maybe a dozen times. I also connect things in it to other literature, and the way it connects with Fathers and Sons, a tedious Russian novel, really helped me survive the reading of F & S. (For those of you who have read both and want to know what the connection is, get this: the society in Brave New World, as material and self-serving as it may be, is nihilist, just like Bazarov. Think about it. If you want to discuss, email me.)This book could not be better in any way. Readable and frightening."
5,this is the future?,Reading this book rendered me incapacitated and winded at the thought that all the effort I've put into my life will be for nought. In the future everyone will be nurtured and conditioned to fit into a certain group that will dictate their behaviour for the rest of their lives. This truly is a horrific portrayal of the future. Just because of the sheer banality and inanity of it all. Let me be a savage in the world of the alpha-minus' and epsilon semi-morons and they would not know what hit them.Huxley's vision remains fresh now as the day he wrote it. The cadences of his prose flourish with the resplendent description of the future. I have never read a book of this nature and had such a cathartic experience. Read and enjoy.
3,"Interesting, But Not Very Relevant","I am a reader of non-fiction, and I guess I never really learned to appreciate works of fiction. I have a hard time applying their relevance to the real world. Every now and then, I attempt to read an ""acclaimed"" piece of fiction, and the results are usually the same: I feel like I've missed something. I prefer to learn about and ponder the ""horrors"" of today's reality by reading history and current events. I find there is more history that I don't know but need to. Reality is far more bizarre than anything that Huxley or Orwell can dream up. By the way, I prefer Orwell's work to Huxley's. I found this work to be very light reading and somewhat entertaining."
5,GREAT!!!,"You must buy this, don't hold back no matter what other reviews say. This is top quality and is a must have if you are considering it"
3,bought for a class only,"i didnt really care to much for the book it self, it was only for an english class i was taking at the time."
2,Enjoyed it for a few chapters...,"This book is entirely too wordy. As great of an author as Aldous Huxley is.....he bogged this book down with every word in the english language. I'm no scholar or human encyclopedia, but I'm far from a moron. After learning the reasoning behind Jim Morrison's band name selection, ""The Doors"", I found myself researching Aldous Huxley's ""The Doors of Perception."" This was put into action because Jim Morrison was all about experimental drug usage and his decisions in life and poetry selections were due in part to many of his readings from Aldous Huxley's books. I thought ""Brave New World"" may live up to the hype, but I was wrong. I'm sure there's plenty of overly positive reviews on this book, but I'll let you be the judge."
4,Trippy...,"This is a very entertaining book, that I honestly enjoyed reading. It gives a great bit of the author's insight and fears of what the future may hold. I believe it portrays an excellent example of the fear that author had in mind about how certain individuals/organizations can (and may be currently using to) control the masses, by the use of drugs, religion and the chemical alteration of it's citizens. Then an outsider comes into this society, rocks the boat and becomes a celebrity of sorts. But your interpretation may be different. The controlling is a much different matter in the book where instead in this reveiw it sounds crazy, but it all fits. I really liked it, and you might too. Go ahead, give it a read, and if you didn't like it, what did you really lose?"
3,Book,"Like the book, just didn't realize it was used for a book report or something of that nature, the writing in it was a little distracting. Other than that it was a good purchase."
2,"open your eyes, read it, THEN THROW IT AWAY","BNW a novel with many labels: utopian, dystopian, sci fi, a metaphor of the present, a warning of the future, a great book, a companion to 1984...I only half read it in high school. I don't think it should be part of standard curriculum, just as I don't think Fahrenheit 451 should be. Huxley and Bradbury's bursting desire to make the world aware of the disorienting menace of media and information control is wasted on adolescents.The book IS thought-provoking, though I wish it had been a short story. As such it would never as been as popular: the characters ARE interesting, but Huxley relies upon THEM to explain everything. The only descriptions are left to them, and as storytellers, they all fall far short of extraordinary.This is not a world I would want to live in.And 1984 is better written."
2,Bland New World,"There are some deep themes and fascinating characters in this book, but no real plot until about halfway through. It's about an ""idyllic"" world where the people are made in laboratories and are programmed to like this, do that. No more individualism, but society only. Be happy with your caste. Let your urges go free. Well enough, thought-provoking--except that the book skips from scene to scene, character to character, and it seemed as if Huxley was trying too hard to depict his ""creepy"" new world. Just didn't live up to its accolades."
2,Meh,"Having seen reviews that this would be a very depressing novel I bought it and started reading, but the only depressing about it was the unengaging content. One of the very few books I quit reading mid-way through.Can not recommend."
4,A book og then and now.,"Thi sbook was a little bit difficult to read in the beginning, but once you read it a couple of times, you get the point it is trying to make."
4,Surprise!,There is actually a summer reading book that I actually enjoy!I love the idea of that kind of Utopia. Very intriguing because we see it like hell but the people really think it is perfect.HMJ :)
2,Surprisingly mediocre,"Having heard mostly good things about the book - I gave it a shot. The story line was confusing, none of the characters were terribly interesting and the whole plot was rather random, if I do say.To be honest I read the book about a year and I remember little - it was that forgettable. I do remember at the time wondering if it would ever just end - I did finish the book (I never just put down a book because I always tend to get invested just enough to wonder if the good part is coming soon). I do remember the letdown of nothing interesting or insightful ever coming.While I've certainly read worse, unfortunately, I cannot recommend the book to others. I'm not saying it's a bad book -certainly many other readers and reviewers have enjoyed this book much more than I have. It just goes to show the varying degrees of human interest."
2,not for weak swimmers,"The beginning is like swimming up current; the reader has to kind of force his/her way into the story, which is made hard by the boring torrents of Huxley's writing style and I often found myself wishing I'd be lodged under a rock to drown in the river that is this book, to just die there and be free from the thoughts that spill into these pages. But, I make it a point to always finish a book, and surprisingly, at times I found myself captivated in the story. The first few chapters make this book hard to get into, but, on the bright side, it picks up a little and there are some beautifully written descriptions that erase my regret for ever picking up this book. However, if you are impatient or easily bored, you won't make it far. If you want a story that'll captivate you from the first page, don't even bother with this book. Try ""The Alchemist."""
4,Terrific...just not as terrific as I thought it would be.,"I finally read this book, and must say, it is utterly terrifying. It was a great read, but is it as good as everyone says it is?Huxley's outlook on the future is a little too negative for me. Yes, I get all that he is trying to say. And yes, the book does make you think and it is the kind of book you can discuss forever. However, he does not convince me at all that the future is bleak.I will not turn this into a discussion on the positives and negatives of progress, etc. This is a book review. The bottom line here is it is a great read. It will definitely open your mind, and is a great conversation topic. It just falls a little bit short of all time great, and may be just slightly overrated."
4,A word of caution,"This is one of my all-time favorite books (in part to chapter 3), I would still like to caution readers: A, don't read while depressed, this book'll not really help. Secondly, for some reason I read this book for the first time during the summer before 7th grade, because I thought it would be a typical science fiction-type dealie. BAD IDEA. It really freaked me out, but I couldn't stop reading because I liked it so much. I'd say, wait until high school. I find some new angle every time I read it, but as Eric Cartman would say: ""It warped my fragile little mind."" Well, at least for one July afternoon. I still recommend it tons, though."
4,A Great Read,"this book was really good. i started reading it because it was on a college book list i had gotten, but i finished the whole book in 3 days... without giving away anything... it was a facinating story about how future life could really turn out to be like."
5,Fascinating and Read (Performed) Well,"A fascinating look at a Utopian society. Michael York does an incredible job ""performing"" this classic story. He uses a different voice and intonation for each character, making it easier to follow Huxley's sometimes confusing leaps from one character or conversation to another. I didn't want it to end."
4,"It was pretty good, but a little confusing","To read this book, you have to unlock that other 90 percent of your brain that stands dormant for the better part of your life. It's one of those books that takes your whole attention, no TV blaring, no siblings running around, just reading. I tried my hardest to recognize all the subliminal messages and morals this book was trying to teach, and I still couldn't get them all.The whole plot of a futuristic ""utopian"" society is well documented in this work. Huxley was a genious, period. How a person could write a book in the 1920's, and predict such things as a ""happy drug"", and a futuristic societies so advanced, is beyond me.If you like science fiction, or just like a good ""mind"" book, get this one. It'll have you thinking for a long time afterwards."
4,The Student's View (Village Academy),"This is a thoughtful book, in which Huxley has used his great knowledge of human relations to bring an eerie reality to this story. This is ones of those books that cannot be ignored. This book was written before the mark of the Nazi totalitarian state of World War II and used the tool of conditioning and drugs instead of military terror and might, that was the basis of George Orwell's ""1984"" that was written after the war. It was an exciting look into Huxley's view of society in the future and the social problems linked with it. Well worth the read."
3,"Good Message, Bad Writer","I'm reading ""Brave New World"" for my Freshman Social Studies class. We read ""1984,"" then ""Animal Farm"" both by George Orwell. I wish I had read this book first, then maybe I'd have thought better of it. Compaired to George Orwell, Aldous Huzley can't write. I've got about 30 pages left and I'm on-line trying to find an easy was to write my paper that's due Monday. I can't sit still, concentrate, and keep awake long enough to finish the book. It's got a great message, and to some Aldous Huxley might be concidered a genious. But I've read better books."
5,Very good,If you liked 1984 you will love this book. Alternate future books are very interesting to me. Couldn't put it down
5,Timeless,It is truly one of the great sience fiction novels of all times.Underneath; there is captivating exploration of the raw emotions that make people tick and an unapologetic acknowledgement that everyone looks at the world through their own complexes.
5,Amazing!!!,"Amazing book!!! This book is very artistic, deep and sad. It is hard to imagine this man wrote the book in the 1930s. Most likely your library will have it."
2,Nowhere near as good as Nighteen Eighty Four,"This book is often cited as being 'like' and 'equal to' Orwell's Nighteen Eighty Four in terms of dystopian classic. While the book was undoubtedly earth-shattering for its time, I'm afraid compared to the timeless compelling masterpiece of Nighteen Eighty Four I found this one dated and irritating. I was just happy when the irritating main characters met their untimely ends and unlike the protagonist of 1984 I felt no compelling point had been made by the deaths."
5,A Classic.,"Aldous Huxley's 'Brave New World' is a classic almost everyone should read before they get out of high school or college. It is not just for science fiction fans, but for lovers of good storytelling in general."
3,"Entertaining, but not unique or surprising","This is one of those books that starts off with a great idea, and just never really goes anywhere. I think the switch in protaganists was unnecessary and took away from the value of the book."
3,Might have been better as a short story...,"Having read BNW a few times, I can't help feeling that it might have been a more successful short story. The opening chapters are gripping and introduce some amazing concepts - such as the Alphas and Epsilons, the decanting, etc - but after this the pace seems to stall somewhat. On as slightly different topic, if you liked BNW you might also enjoy Isaac Asimov's Robot series, which also explores the use of different social classes, but replaces all the 'slave' classes with robots."
4,Brilliant! A book that makes one think!,A brilliant book! It really makes you look at the World differently and think more for yourself. It should be required reading.
5,Best book I've ever read. Couldn't put it down.,Brilliant. Outstanding story along with meaningful message. Always be ready for the humor that sneaks in.
3,"not bad, but not my kind of story","Although most feel that it's well written and great, I wasn't able to get into it too well. My advice...Try it out...I feel better for having read it."
4,"An important, but dry read","I got this book because dystopia is my favorite genra. I expected to love it, which i did, but only for its content. Not for its style. It definetly doens t"" go down easy"" and many times i found myself dreading the next few pages. While i think the message is wonderful, it esnt ""sweep you away"" like many other fine novels."
4,A good read.,"I enjoy books like this one. I like looking at their society and thinking that I'm really glad that things aren't that way around here. What a relief. I don't think I could live in a society that is so obsessed with pleasure. A very good book though, I highly recommend it."
5,Brave New Performance,This is certainly one of most characterful and dramatic readings in my experience of having heard over 200 audio books. BRAVO to Michael York! I wish more actors of such talent would record more important literature unabridged. Don't miss this phenomenal performance of a great novel!
5,Frightening depiction of a society without introversion,"The novel, the ""Brave New World"" by Aldous Huxley, is really scary. It depicts a future society where there is no natural reproduction with children having a mom and dad. Instead people come from laboratories and are conditioned for their different castes. On top of this, people do not read literature such as Shakespeare. Anything done by oneself is discouraged (with the exception of taking a drug called Soma). For some people who are more outgoing, this society might sound like a paradise. For people like myself who prefer to not go clubbin' with their friends and instead like to stay home and read a book, the society depicted in ""A Brave New World"" is hell on Earth."
4,A challenging but Interesting Book,Brave New World is a very interesting book that draws you in. This book makes you think about a different world other than the world we live in today and how people think differently as a result. The author uses different points of view and changes from character to character to make the reading interesting.I feel that the only weakness in this book is the level of explanation or depth. They throw you right into the story without much explanation or background. This gives the book an appealing aspect but also makes it confusing to read.If you are planning on reading this book you should know that there is some very challenging vocabulary. These words would make it very challenging to read this book at a young age.But overall I think this is an awesome book if you are in the mood for a dystopian adventure.
3,"A Second Rate ""1984""","Brave New World is a unique satire on contemporary society. It uses a futuristic utopia to critique modern (1932) issues of science, religion, and society in general.The problem with the novel is style. It's pedantic. There are a few gems in Brave New World. For example, in the beginning when Huxley goes between narratives 2-3 times per page. However, for the most part, Huxley bluntly reiterates the same ideas. The Savage's conversations on the virtue of Shakespearean morality is especially obtuse.Orwell's ""1984"" is a masterpiece. In comparison, ""Brave New World"" felt like a sophomoric attempt."
3,"Beautiful audio, annoying layout",I use this audio cd set to help my 12th grade English class study the novel Brave New World. Michael York does a fantastic job reading the novel by providing a vast array of character voices. It is the new layout design of the CD that has changed which makes use in the classroom difficult. The CDs are no longer labeled to indicate which chapters are covered per cd. This would make it difficult for anyone who wants to switch between the audio and the book itself.
5,A world where everyone takes happy pills to ignore their issues....,Hmmmm- this book along with 1984 should be required reading for everyone. If you spoke to someone from the 1930's and you told them that we live in a world where every move we make is recorded and everyone takes antidepressants to ignore their problems- they would be horrified.
4,The World After Ford,"I enjoyed reading Brave New World by Aldous Huxley and watching the lives of the characters unfold from the beginning. The growth and dismantling of the characters brings you right into their world. This world Huxley created 60 years ago is very similar to today. I was able to make connections between my life and the lives of the characters, which really brought this book to life. This is a fast read and great for a Sunday afternoon."
5,A great Book,I was reading the other reviews and it just seemed to me that nobody really saw the point to the book. This could happen expesually in this time of year. Our world is moving towards asocitiy that we don't have a freedom of speech. They are working on to controling our minds its only a matter of time. I read the book for my senior english class and was a real eye opening expereince. its a dictarorship which is just like cuba. I think everybody should read the book because it really shows you how the world could be.
5,Just an amazing story the whole way through,"Picking up this book without ever reading it in highschool or 1984 I had no expectations. After reading it, I LOVED IT. I fell in lov right away with the characters and the whole idea of the world they live in. Its a reasonably short read, but there is soo much to take form it other than just the story.I really loved the ending of the book, it was soo fitting and right for the story. Most people I know perfer 1984 over BNW, but I say BNW is better. Dont take my word for it, read it for yourself, even if you think 1984 is the better book, at least you've read a literary classic!!!"
1,Brave New World,I still have not received this book...i had to go buy a new one since i have not received it and need it for 01/15/2012 latest for school.
2,low expectation,"I didn't have high expectations for the condition of this book, still I was a bit disapointed. It was worn and also had someones name written across the bottom end of book pages. I don't ever buy paperbacks but couldn't find a hard cover. The book was very cheap though and probably a fair price."
1,One Chapter of Greatness,"The books first chapter is an amazing and truely thought provoking on that all people should read and consider if we are in fact moving towards it. But from there on out it's pretty much crap. The story is uninteresting and seemingly pointless, containing far to many coincidental events."
4,A Twisted Story of Future Gone Wrong,"I personally liked 1984 better because it was more realistic, but Brave New World is far more twisted. Instead of pleasure outlawed, sex in general is outlawed. Babies are made in test tubes. They come out in an assembly line. People are educated to hate things. Each class is educated to look down on the others. Children are encouraged to have erotic play. The whole society is educated to take soma, a depressant. One man from the still-normal world of New Mexico, which is called The Savage Reservation by those of the other world because sex i how babies are formed, rebels and throws soma out the window in the face of kids. This evil story of a world I hope never becomes true is nonetheless thrilling."
3,Great depiction of the future but the way its told....,"It has a great and seemingly accurate vision of the future. The books message seems to apply to our times a lot more each and every day. But the story telling is slow and boring. It isn't paced at a very good speed and the whole deal about ""savage reservations"" was so unrealistic it was annoying. I liked the book but i definately don't think it was GREAT. It should be in the library of people who like to read but for people who just read for fun: BORROW THIS BOOK FROM YOUR LIBRARY."
4,'80s experimentations are here!,"the first nik kershaw's album proves to be a fantastic starting point for all those people(especially young people) who is curious about eighties music sounds and experimentations. Tracks as Bogart,Dancing Girls,Gone to Pieces,Human Racing are all different and all equally interesting. And we must not forget this album also includes the super hits Wouldn't it be good and I won't let the sun go down on me!"
4,Impressive,"I am impressed with this design an implementation. Unfortunately, its missing the top over-the-head strap which it needs as the batteries (2xAAA) are housed with the bulb placing extra weight that could be compensated for with the strap we all see in the photos for this light. Oh well, happy with the quality nontheless; especially for the price!"
3,It works,"Mine came with the strap!! This headlamp works fine, and the lower power is all I need in dark locations (and that's usually where I use a headlamp). The hat brim attachment is a challenge, but I use the head strap exclusively. The battery chamber cap twists to open and close."
1,Not As Pictured!,"Not As Pictured! It does not have the over the head strap. I wanted a head light with the ""over the head"" strap. I'll be returning this.I wish I would have read the review that mentioned this (I just saw that review)."
2,Not as advertised,I am interested in a headlamp with two straps as the picture for this product shows. So when I received it and found it came with only one strap I thought I was sent the wrong item. Also the package did not come with a shipping slip stating what I had purchased. So I called customer service explained that I received only one strap and they sent another Steamlight 61405 to me. Again with only one strap. You are misrepresenting this item with the picture with it. I am very disappointed.
3,"Decent, convenient. Not very bright","Its ok. Its convenient, uses AAA, the strap comes off and you can clip it to your hat brim. Its good for finding your way around your campsite or letting one of your kids borrow it, but I wouldnt take it on a night hike or anything. Get the streamlight ARGO instead."
1,Half Battery,Half the battery life of the published spec. I returned immediately due to false advertising. I cannot review the lamp because I did not open it.
2,Did not get the over-the-strap???I give it a 2&1/2,"I got my purchase but rude awakening,did not get over-the-head strap.I saw the advertise picture.lo'and be hold...did not.Well any,the head lamp is nice,two bright light mode.I use it pretty much everywhere.When you need to hands to work,this lamp does the job.But I'am still wondering what went wrong with my order.Consumer Beware."
4,Pretty good,"This is a pretty solid headlamp. I needed it for outdoor evening rescue simulations for a WFR course. It worked, but was not the brightest one out there."
4,handy for things close up,"I often work in poorly lit areas around my house. This light is nice & small but thus has limited reach. You might need an additional light if things are too far away. Also found myself hitting things with it repeatedly, inadvertently adjusting it. Good light for it's size/prize though!"
3,Headlamp,Handy little light but nothing great. It is cheap enough so go ahead and buy one if you wnat one to provide a little light you can wear on your head and keep your hands free.
2,Not always waterproof,"Recently went night snorkeling, and purchase this headlamp for the occasion. After about 25 minutes of use, the light died. (Dangerous situation to be in!) Once I got back to shore I discovered that it had leaked, and thus was not water-proof, (the manufacturer claims it is). My friend bought the same headlamp but did not have this problem."
5,Love it.,"This was the rave at our last group camping trip. All the kids wanted one. Ofcourse, we only had enough for our kids + 2 more (which were supposed to be for us parents) to lend. Then I saw it for a little less @ Target. Think of all the things you'll need light for hands free: preping/cleaning meals after sunset, going to the porta pottie, etc. Who wants to scramble with the flash light in one hand while doing your business? A must have on your next camping trip."
4,better than i expected.,I purchased this headlamp to wear while running in the ragnar relay race.( a headlamp is required as the race goes all night and is in some remote areas. I was worried that it would be either uncomfortable being tight or keep slipping off my head while running. But neither was true at all. It didnt slip one bit and it was actually quite comfortable. The light was bright enough for the purpose intended.
4,The Yugo of Headlamps,"This headlamp is light, takes my kids abuse and works like it's supposed to. I bought three for my 8 year old triplets and they haven't managed to destroy them and they haven't fallen apart on their own. Nothing fancy but not a bad headlamp for the price and my purposes."
5,Worked perfectly.,I recently went on a 33 mile hike in Big Bend National Park and it worked perfectly. We started every day hiking in the dark and finished the third day in the dark. It worked great for hiking in the dark.
4,do i look dorky ?,good quality construction good brightness adjustable output for different needs like the removable center strap i work on cars all day great for hands off lighting puts the light right were its needed
5,Stream Light heaqdlight,This hi/lo power lite is very small and light even though it has power for long periods. The 0.5 watt LED is just the same light that I bought at target years back under the River Rock brand name. This has been a very durable and handy flashlight. Wearing it around my neck is more comfortable for me to allow hands-free use.
1,Not as pictured,"Lamp works, but I wanted the strap that went over the head - none of the 3 I ordered had the extra strap. Amazon customer service gave me several options though. But beware - you may not get the over the head strap."
1,Stream light dropped the ball,I am a fan of Streamlight products. I have a Streamlight rail mount light on my handgun and daily carry their flashlight that is shaped like a pen. This headlamp is a piece of crap. Very cheaply made. Do not buy it.
4,Great reliable headlight!,I have used this headlight for weeks now in hunting and camp situations and found it to be exactly as advertised.It is very good quality and the run time is nice. I use it mostly on low and it lasts very well with the 2-AAA batteries it uses which by the way are another reason I tried this in the first place because AAA are common and available as well as cheap to use. The Enduro is awesome for the price and the high setting is pretty good for about anything within reason for a light of this caliber. I can't speak of its waterproof design but it looks like it will take a drenching with no problem with the oring seal it has in the battery compartment cap.You can't go wrong for the money.
4,Good Light,"This is a decent head light. We got two, this one and the Streamlight 61052 Septor LED Headlamp with Strap. This one has a more spot on light while the other is a bit brighter and illuminates a larger area. If I was to buy again, I'd probably stick with the Streamlight 61052 Septor LED Headlamp even though its a bit more, but if your looking for something on the cheaper side that will get the job done, this one will do just fine."
3,hard to open package,hard to get battery compartment open to put battery in once you get it out of th case it comes in.
4,good light for the money,"Strap feels secure haven't used the clip for hat though.Overall bright light for the money ,ajusts very easily. no complaints."
4,good buy,this is a good product for the price. durable and strong elastic band. stays on my hardhat great. also clips and holds onto a hat very well.
3,"Lighter is fine, design is not","The lighter itself works perfectly, but my husband has only had this 2 months and the design has already worn off. I wish I had bought him one with the design etched in."
2,If you don't fall asleep you might learn something,Reading textbooks is not how a lot of people learn best. This book contains too few real-life examples and could not hold my attention. The sections of the book I was able to stay awake through were generally common sense topics that people should know if they have been in the web industry for more than 1 month.
4,Good book for beginners,"The book raises a lot of issues that need to be dealt with in designing a web site. This is not a book on how to create a web page. A lot of the material in the book is common sense, but good as a refresher. The book is well written and easy to read."
2,Information architecture babble,"For a book on Information architecture to be useful it can either present new ideas or it can present old ideas in a systematic manner.I am sorry to say, but this book does not neither. No new information is presented and no attempt is made to systematize the knowledge. The book is best characterized as a monologue, with lots of repetitions and banalities, and no adequate final summary.It is, perhaps, of some value for the complete novice on web design, to show that web design can be dealt with rationally, but then again, the chances that novice designers have to deal with large websites is extremely low.There is therefore no reason to buy this book.I give it two stars because it is well written and not incoherent. But why it was written, I don't know."
3,Go got to dig for the gems.,"This book can easily be divided into 2 sections. The first is an overview of how and why information is organized. The second is how to apply that information when planning and designing a large website. To the author's credit, they took a potentially dull topic and actually made it interesting. I would have appreciated less background and theory and more practical advise on how to plan a website though. There are some gems in this book, but you really have to dig to find them. Since there is really no ""hands on"" advise this is a good book to read while traveling. If your designing a large enterprise website you would be wise to read at least the second half of this book...especially if you are in management."
1,Slow and obvious,"This book may be OK if you've just been put in charge of an intranet and have never used the web before. If you have spent more than a week surfing the internet in your life, you will feel, as I did, that this book states and restates the blindingly obvious ad nauseum. I actually failed to finish this book, I found it so terribly dry and unenlightening. Another thing that really bugs me about it is that the authors pose question after question, but never really supply an answer. Sometimes they make tentative suggestions that this-may-work-then, but never many good examples. They also reference screenshots of one little area of a given website, but this doesn't work because (if you believe the basic premise of the book) a website is a coherent item, not a distinct set of pages. Therefore highlighting specific elements of a website out of context is meaningless. Better spend your time surfing the web and thinking for yourself why some sites work and some don't."
3,"Good point, but bad content/space relation","The book argues for web masters/designers to think more about the site and less about single pages: Navigation and terminology should be unified throughout the site, before the individual pages are detailed. If you buy this argument, you may like the book, because there are few others which stress that point. However, the advice the authors offer on how to achieve that unification is not that overwhelming - I found most of the book vague and much too long; many arguments are repeated over and over from chapter to chapter. This book makes a good point, but is not really dense with information."
4,A good resource,"There are not that many titles covering information architecture. This is surprising if one considers how many web sites are poorly organised and constructed.The book is mainly about the organisation of information. Graphic artists and programmers will be disappointed, but people who are interested in designing usable websites for real people, should find this book valuable.The book is presented as an introduction. To get deeper into any of the subjects covered, the reader will have to follow it up with other resources."
3,Makes a stong argument for thoughtful Website design.,I found the beginning of this book to be very informative and thought provoking. The first two and a half chapters provide a compelling discussion of the need for Information Architects and the roles they should play.The rest of the book was less interesting review of some basic organizational concepts with outdated examples. I just didn't learn that much in the second half of the book.
2,Applied Common Sense,"I'm quarter way through this book. Some things have been pleasing, like reading that they find flashing gifs everywhere annoying, and I use these to show my clients that my original gut-feeling was right (they had a few and I said 'lose them'). But really its like applied common sense. Of course people like the powerful facilities at hand etc. I found most of what I'm reading covered on two twenty minute chats with Drue Miller on webmonkey radio"
3,Less here than the title suggests,"While there is very good material here for designing the structure of a large web site, I had hoped for ideas about an information architecture that spans an organization and makes use of web tools as a communication medium between disparate databases."
1,"Bottom line, don't waste $20 on this book","I am in the middle of reading through this book for the second time, trying to find something that isn't common knowledge. If you are completely new to web navigation design you might benefit from this book, but the authors do not present a coherent methodology. In fact, I have found navigation design information on the web to be vastly superior to the authors' ideas. Information Architecture is an incredibly misleading title, the guts of the book deal only in mainstream navigation ideas. The authors simply summarize information that is readily available and completely avoid any innovative ideas or future directions of web site design. Bottom line, don't waste $20 on this book."
2,These guys know way more than they're letting on.,"This is a good primer on Information Architecture. But I get the feeling that these guys decided just to knock off after 150 pages. That was easier than contending with the knotty implications of all the conflicting structural imperatives that IAs deal with day in and day out.Given that the authors work at nothing but Information Architecture, I sincerely hope that they have a far greater depth of knowledge than this book conveys.Mostly, the message that rings through this brochure is: ""Principle x is highly valuable sometimes, but it all depends on how it interacts with principles y and z, and you'll just have to figure out what's the most important as you go along.""Well, duh. Those compromises between design principles are the hard part of the job, and the authors don't provide a solid practical or theoretical framework for working through the compromise process."
4,This book teach somethign that is a full work,"This book is full of a lot of very interesting stuff and contains a lot of reference to documentation.The first part is for all users that want to know how to manage a site and what to analyze how a site must be composed, so is more or less something that every one must read at least one time in life.The second part is more hard to read. It really teach you how the work of an Information Architect must be done, so is someway less interesting if you don't plan to do this in your life (even if is still full of interesting things)."
4,Good for explaining concepts,"Provides in depth coverage of how to organize and provide access to information for the Web. I like it because it gives you a comprehensive tour of all the major concepts, systems, and strategies used to organize information for your web site.Because it covers a lot of ground, its not necessarily a how-to guide book, but rather is more of a deep introspective of what information architecture (IA) is, as an academic discipline. In that regard, it is quite insightful and offers many good resources of how the field evolved, and where its at today, and what role it plays in the ever changing business community.If anything, as a result of reading this book, I found that I now have a deeper appreciation for what it takes to create a systems-wide approach towards the organization of information. In particular, an appreciation for what it takes to design information for users to help them find the information that they need."
5,You cannot design good web sites without this book,"Louis and Peter defined what it means to be an information architect. And this book makes it very clear that good Web sites must be architected, not simply designed and not simply coded. It is a shame, really, that the term ""designer"" has been appended to the word ""Web"" to mean anyone who has ever written any HTML. Hogwash. The creation of great Web pages is not random and is not done by one person. This book lays out the role of the person, called the information architect, who determines the structure of a site and how the visitor to the site will reach the bits they want. Once the IA is done, visual designers, developers, and other team members can implement this architecture. The two of them, through their former company Argus Associates, and through the Argus Center for Information Architecture, have forced the Web disciplines to evolve and to confront what lack of good architecture and design creates."
4,I like Lynch and Horton better,"I know that the Lynch and Horton (Web Style Guide) book is slightly different in it's thrust, but I think it's better at the overall delivery of information architecture and web design theory and practice. It's highly professional and stands out from all the fluff-guides to web design. Then again, Rosenfeld and Morville do take a unique library science perspective that is one of a kind (if not a bit chatty). Guess it's good to own both books."
1,Very biased book,"In general, this book contains some useful yet common sense information. This book is more about how to become a talker than a worker. I read through and found the first half confirmed my experience and the second half is a bust. If you want to become an office politician, this is a must have."
1,Poor Quality & u can not connect another hose to it,"This item does not last long. A tear formed in it after 3.5 weeks of use. In addition, you can not connect another hose to it since the end is capped off permanently. Save your money, there are better products out there!"
1,Don't buy this hose!,"I wonder if the reason the manufacturer discontinued making this hose is because it does an awful job of watering an area that you wish to cover. The hose doesn't lie flat easily and doesn't allow water to flow through it with any force. Compared to another hose from a different company, which sprays about 5 feet high, this hose's spray is scarcely a foot or two high."
4,Awesome soulful rock,"4.5 starsThis is a great album by a very talented singer, pianist, guitarist and songwriter. The songs are all great and the band is solid with great hooks and horn lines and Jen sings with heartfelt emotion you can feel. This CD has a little R&B;, a little rock, a little funk, a little Latin, and a whole lot of soul. If you are a fan of Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder, etc, check Jen Kearney out."
2,POSTSCRIPT,"This is a postscript to my review titled ""The Book Who Couldn't Dance."" For me, the last straw comes on Page 218, when Yudkoff botches his description of the ""Singin' in the Rain"" number. It's one thing for Yudkoff to botch the numbers in LIVING IN A BIG WAY, which after all is a fairly obscure film -- though NOT impossible to view -- but to botch the most famous Kelly number in SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, the most famous Kelly film of all time?! Well, how can you trust ANYTHING in the book after that?"
3,My 6th Book on Gene Kelly,"OK, I've been reading this book for a week now and I'm enjoying it so far. Yes there are some mistakes, but I've read all of the other books about Gene and there are mistakes in all of them. While it's true that Yudkoff did not talk to many people who knew Kelly, this book was written in 1999 and many if not most eye witnesses were dead or close to it. The one glaring mistake is that of having Vera Ellen at his AFI tribute. She died that year and never ever went to awards. She became a recluse for some reason. I do like the way the book covers more than just what happened, but also the emotions and back stories. Yudkoff did have Lois Mcclelland's diary for some of the inside intrigue for later in the book. Lois was a constant in Gene's life from 45 to the early to mid 90s. No one knew him better.This is just a beginning review and I'll finish when I finish the book."
1,K. Cooley's review.,"I totally agree with K. Cooley's review. I'm halfway through reading the bio and glad I borrowed it and didn't buy it. His ""poetic license"" usage is absurd. He should have written a novel with GK as main character. To brazenly write supposed thoughts of Gene Kelly is ridiculous. How could anybody say this is a great or even good bio of the man? I might look for the Hirschhorn book and get some factual information on this talented guy, Gene Kelly. I doubt I would ever read another book written by Alvin Yudoff."
2,Bored me in the first chapter,"I love Gene Kelly but I don't love this book. I don't see the point in the AFI tribute, just get to the history. The only good thing I can say about this book is that Gene Kelly's talent and determination come through, but that is nothing the author did, that was Gene Kelly and you can get that from any book, any movie, and any story told about him."
5,"Very Informative, a ""must have"" if your tyring to concieve","I feel that this book was a very informative, and easy to follow. It answered all of my questions and then some. It was a great reference guide for me later when I actually need to use the methods referenced in the book. I think the information in this book is something every couple should know. For my husband and I this was a great sharing experience. It was wonderful learning about myself and us and how we can work together to acomplish one goal."
2,Eh,"It might have been good when it was written, but I found the story lines uninteresting, the lead character was annoying and it isn't a very good read. BUT I wasn't expecting much"
4,Spode Napkin Rings Not as good quality as 15 yrs ago.,"These napkin rings are OK, they won't mark your table with their rough un-glazed edge if you paint it with clear nail polish.....Now days they're made in China as cheaply as possible.They used to be completely covered with shiny glaze, now they set it on one edge and glaze the rest, leaving the one edge un-glazed. I'll never buy them again. The Spode company representative is OK, I complained that the 1st set was not good...it had a 'slipped' tree transfer (the decal under the glaze was wrinkled) and was missing glaze on one edge.Spode sent me another set of 4, but the glaze was still missing. Spode is obviously run by 'bean counters', and they are letting their quality slip.Larry Kelley"
3,FREE prime shipping!,Product is what my mother was lookin for.Also when you get the prime shipping 1 or 3 month free trial shipping is free!thanks amazon!
3,Exactly what you expect...,"The product itself is good and contains everything you'd expect from a cheap eyeglass repair kit; however, it's just too expensive when shippping and handling is added. You're better off getting the same thing at a local drug or convenience store for a much lower price, no more than 3 dollars. I happen to be on a military base overseas that didn't have these in stock for a while."
2,Not very Good,"I bought this stuff and expected it to be a good addition to my lawn. But within two days of its installation, it became clear that its not going to work. The battrey wouldn't get charged fully even when the solar panel is kept in full sun-light for the whole day. As you attach the number of lamps, the lights would dim to the level of a very very faint glow. And it won't stay put for long either. Could have been a more robust, illuminating stuff as the product claims itself to be.-Prashant"
1,static city,I returned the first lightsnake because the light only lit at one end. the second unit makes static after I connected the cable between the lightsnake and my amp. I'm back to recording via line in/mic in by using a 1/8 by 1/4 adapter. good luck.
2,Crappy.,"This thing is crap. The LightSnake records well, but the utterly fail flashing light on the cable makes a VERY audible clicking in the playback. It is by no means a professional cable, and on top of that, is made with crappy parts to boot. UGH. If I could place a restraining order on inanimate objects. I would have one affiliated with this cord."
2,Noisy,"I got the LightSnake so I could record my keyboard into my computer. I got it to work fairly quickly with Adobe Audition, but found anything I recorded had a LOT of noise behind it...Well, at least too much noise for me. LightSnake blows."
3,Was good my GarageBand-period.,"How many times have I tried this with my Apple Logic express? about hundred times..and it didn't work. This cable works pretty well with GB though, but you get these messages of feedback overloads and you have to keep going back to GB preferences in order to recalibrate the Audio/Midi setups in/outs etc, and it did happen too often during my projects.. Especially when using high gain virtual amp modes setup for my guitar sound.I have a Mac with an OS 10.5.8, and even though I tried all the tricks to get it to work with logic express, it did not. SoundTech(the manufacture of this product), actually agreed to send me a replacement because my first cable had about a second of delay, hence a very noticeable latency.. so this review is actually for the second cable, which was fine. The first cable would not even get one star but I knew this was a defect one."
3,Lightsnake,I bought this on Ebay and it works well with the New Gen Macbook Pro's 2007 models but as soon as I started recording to Garageband it would make a irritating clicking sound which I believe is from the blinking green light.I have read another review from a buyer having the same problem.Tech states this is a defect so will see if this hold true or is a software problem with Mac's.I am and will buy another to see if this noise goes away.Overall its great to lay tracks down but having a super fast comp is the key.
3,Lag,No one has mentioned any lag. I experienced about a quarter of a second lag between what I played and what was recorded on the computer.It's possible I'm also doing something wrong so I would appreciate quick comments.Cheers.
2,NOT what you expect!,"I was very disappointed. I guess I expected more from O'Reilley, but they definitely did not deliver. Webmaster in a Nutshell is a tiny tiny tiny book that is mediocre at best. The CD with 5 electronic books is not on a par with other reference libraries. So now I have this expensive dust collector. The only good news is that I followed the advice (unfortunately too late) of the previous reviewer and bought the Web publishing Electronic Resource Kit. I am very happy with THAT kit"
3,Review for The Traveler,"The Traveler provides the reader with a suspenseful and unpredictable plot, containing dark humor and extreme conflicts in relationships. The character Mihaly is constantly confused and has intense conflicting issues with himself, his wife, and his old friends. Antal Szerb's discussion between male and female roles disturbed European countries during World War II. However, having now been brought to the attention of American readers through the translation of Peter Hargitai, it illustrates natural human behaviors."
4,The Traveler,"This novel is about a man named Mihaly who is trying to find happiness with his life and with himself. The story starts off while he is on his honeymoon in Italy, there he begins to remains about his childhood friends, Tamas and Eva, and he begins to feel as if the games they would play were the root of his sexual fantasies. Mihaly's friend Tamas passed away and his spirit begins to haunt him and this causes him to fall into depression. After falling into this depression he leaves his wife and begins a search for the people whom he shared these childhood memories of joy with. While one his search Mihaly becomes infatuated with his old friends and with the thought of dying. Dying was also a part of the game that they would play as children. He does not fully get over his infatuation with his old friends and death till he himself is faced with a moment were he feels he is going to die, and he recognizes that he is afraid of dying."
4,really good read,"The Traveler by Antal Szerb is an amazing story about a man named Mihaly who is trying to find his true self. Once you start reading The Traveler right away you will gain interesting the story. As you read through the book you start to realize that Mihaly is gay or even bisexual. He leaves his wife during there honeymoon to find himself, well he ends up walking all over Italy finding himself. And during his search he is constantly thinking of his old friend Tamas. I recommend this book to anyone. And jus to add the end is great."
3,The Traveler,"Antal Szerb's The Traveler tells the story of Mihaly and how he struggles to accept his past. The novel begins in Italy were Mihaly and his wife Erzsi are celebrating their honeymoon. And although a honeymoon should be a significant time in the life of this newly married couple, Mihaly is overwhelmed by a past created by suffering Mihaly, Szerb is able to effectively question the roles of the sexes by developing the theme of androgyny. Androgyny, which indicates a blurring of the traditional role of men and women, is seen quite often in the way Mihaly and Tamas are not the typical aggressive male as compared to the extremely dominant Eva. For one, Mihaly loves playing the part of the victim while Eva is able to hold her liquor better than any of the men. I gave the book three stars, because Szerb does an excellent job in describing Mihaly 's journey to self-discovery."
4,The Traveler,"The Traveler by Antal Szerb is a truly captivating story. It begins with Mihaly and Erzsi's honeymoon and the somewhat comical incidences that occur. The book shows the journey of Mihaly struggling to find himself and his identity. Mihaly is in a constant struggle between fantasy and reality, but he attempts to escape reality whenever possible. He needs to let go of his past and travels to many places in an effort to find happiness. This book has a wonderful story line and is extremely detailed."
3,separated love,"I loved this book, it was amazing.Mihali, the main character goes on a journey to find his true self,When he got separated on his own honeymoon. He then realizes that he is not who he thinks he is so he decides to leave his wife.While he travels to many beautiful places in Italy he comes along with some obstacles.He gets really sick.He then meets some friends from the past that help him find his true self. It was fun to read it since he traveled around Italy,and I been there so when he talked about the places i could picture myself there."
3,The Traveler,"This novel's depiction of life is hard to grasp. It leaves the reader sometimes wondering about certain meanings in the book. It is interesting to read how Mihaly wandered through the dark alleys of Venice on his honeymoon instantly portraying a conflict in the the novel from the very beginning. There are many clandestine meanings to life and death in this fascinating novel, but these meanings are later explained in the afterword of the book by Peter Hargitai. I give this book a three star rating."
3,A Visit to the Past,"The Traveler is a mind-boggling novel that takes one through a journey around Italy. Mihaly, the main character, becomes obsessed with his past and struggles to find his childhood friends. Even though this book was not a page turner, it made one think."
5,The Traveler,"The Traveler is a very captivatiing and interesting story. It starts off talking about Mihaly and Erzsi's honeymoon and everything that went on during it. It shows all the struggles Mihaly is facing to find out who he really is. It is a pretty slow paced book but it is filled with many obstacles and keeps you wondering what will happen next. Overall, I enjoyed this book and would recommend it."
4,The Traveler,"The Traveler is a descriptive love novel, written by Antal Szerb and translated by Peter Hargitai. The book is based on Mihaly's life on a trip through Europe which began as a honeymoon with his so called ""wife"" Erzsi. Mihaly is an undecided young man who unknowingly lives his life in love with his childhood ""memory"" Eva. Antal Szerb writes with detail and descriptive images of Italian scenes as Mihaly searches for his own being. I think the book disserves 4 stars."
5,A journy to the inerself,"Is Mihaly bisexual? Antal Szerb gives us Mihaly, a confused soul who is honeymooning with his wife Erzi in Italy. Although their first few days are fine, Mihaly gets lost in Italy, trying to ""find himself"". This is a book about finding truth of ""self."" Mihaly's obsession with Tamas a.k.a Eva are a window into his past. Antal Szrerb runs the gamut of emotions.Mihaly, encounters and has affairs with women, experiences death, and tries to deal with his wife. This is a scope and sequence of a life;through a captivating journey for truth. I really enjoyed this book, and could't stop reading once I started."
4,The shocking past,"If you're ready for a big surprise read The Traveler. From beginning to end this book keeps you on your toes. The main character, Mihali, marries a woman by the name, Erzsi. They both went to Italy to celebrate their honeymoon, although it seemed as if it was a disaster. Mihali liked doing things on his own and it seemed as if they were celebrating without each other. At on point Mihali and his wife ran into one of his childhood friends. This opened up the door to a conversation with his wife about his past. Mihali was the type of guy who was completely honest and at the same time was masochistic. In his stories you can tell how odd he was.At the end of the book Peter Hargitai wrote an afterward that cleared many things up. His interview with the wife made a big difference in the novel. It was very shocking yet true. I suggest all readers out there to read this book because it has many teachings about life and oneself."
4,A lesson to learn,"This novel was full of lessons and themes. I really enjoyed reading it because it was so twisted in its own way that i just couldn't stop reading.It is an amazing story of a long journey that may have started very early in the protagonist's life. It is a hourney that seems to never end, full of questions and only some answers. It is an ineer journey, trying to find one's self. The book has themes such as confused homosexuality, death eroticism, journey of the self and androgyny. It is a wonderful way to walk the paths of the protagonist as he describes it to us in this fictional autobiography. For those who are histpry lovers, this book is a must read. The cities mentioned are so symbolic to the themes of the novel. Mihaly adn Erzi are characters like you have never read about before. You will learn the mistery of Tamas and Eva and hwo they really turned out to be. Who was Mihaly in live with? Tamas or Eva? Read and find out..."
4,Good Read,This was a wonderful story highlightng Mihaly's journey to the self. The book had fascingating themes like death eroticism and androgyny that keeps the reader wanting more.
5,Thrilling!!,"It has it all: love, mystery, friendship, adventure, death, betrayal, translation, and afterwards! Thanks to Peter Hargitai, The Traveler is now more fascinating, capturing, and insightful than ever!!"
4,Finding your true self,"The Traveler is an interesting book about the meaning of ones true life. Its about a man named Mihaly, living what one would say to be two separate life .He sets out on a journey to find his true self .To bad for his wife that its there Honey Moon night when he decides to leave and find himself. He's lured into roaming the dark streets of Italy to find true meaning of himself. But cant stop thinking of his past and his life long friend Tamas. I couldn't help but think that Mihaly is secretly in love with his guy friend Tamas. Many things can be learned in this novel and many messages can be revealed only if the book is read in depth. I strongly recommend this book to everyone, but especially those who seek to find themselves."
4,Wow,This book is not exactly a romantic book. That is a good thing because not everything is love and peace. This guy was seriously trying to find his true self and which person hasn't? He finds out at the wrong time that he has to find himself. After the honeymoon he left his wife to go traveling and to find himself. But comes across an illness. It was a very interesting book and I would definitely recommend it to any person who likes fun and adventure
4,The Traveler,"If you think loosing your partner on your honeymoon is impossible, after reading this tale you will be mistaken. The Traveler is an interesting story of loss, life, and death. For Mihaly (the main character)he is forced to deal with them all. To survive he must succumb to internal resolutions and self-healing to get through this ordeal. This book has amazing literary techniques while offering strong and apparent insights to life."
5,The traveler,"The Traveler is a book that takes us on journey through the struggles of a person,Mihaly, to find himself. It is an interesting book because it defies some of society's taboo themes, like homsexuality and incest. We learn from this book how one's childhood can affect one's adulthood. Another reason why i found this book interesting is because many can relate to the book, for example many people, after many years, decide to change sexuality. Overall really interesting and enjoyable."
4,The Traveler Review,"The Traveler, written by Antal Szerb, translated by Peter Hargitai, is a fictional novel about a man named Mihaly who is struggling with his past. It is an extremely interesting tale that begins with Mihaly's honeymoon in Italy. It turns out to be no ordinary romantic get away when Mihaly begins to realize his past has come back to haunt him. Mihaly becomes obsessed with every detail of his childhood and decides to abandon his wife in search for answers to the mysteries of his youth. Mihaly's journey to self-discovery keeps the novel very interesting and its English translation allows us to capture every detail of the voyage."
3,Not for me,"I'm sure that when the book was written it was very shocking. But now days people are use to almost anything, it was not a page turner. Personally I don't recomend the book, but I understand that some people might be interested in reading it. It was too slow for me and the topic of te book was not my favorite."
3,Erzsi is sexy,"The Novel starts a little slow, but once it gets going hold on to your hair. Thrilling, mysterious."
4,Journey Toward the True Self,"""The Traveler"", written by Antal Szerb, is an extraordinary book, filled with love and excitement. The novel tells of a man, Mihaly, who is in Italy on his honeymoon with his new wife, Erzsi. Throughout the entire time that the two are together, nothing seems to click. They seem very distant from each other and they even seem a little like strangers. Suddenly, everything begins to change when Mihaly mistakenly gets on the wrong train. Here, Mihaly begins his adventure and realizes that he has been untrue to himself his entire life. He dedicates his time to finding out everything from his past and how he can reclaim that happiness that he once felt.I was very impressed with the afterword produced by Peter Hargitai. It allowed for all confusions to be erased and for the empty voids to be filled. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking to read a story about finding your true self and not being afraid to open yourself up to the world."
3,Emily's review of The Traveler,"The Traveler written by Antel Szerb and translated by Peter Hargitai is an excellent piece of literature. This story begins with the honeymoon of Mihaly and Erzai in Italy and becomes a story of understanding and becoming more insightful on Mihalys past. His relationship with Eva and Tamas is key to this story. The complexity of this relationship is one in which he longs to go back to throughout the book. This book is insightful, deep, and entertaining and I recommend it greatly."
3,Spaced out,"3 1/2Before Orb got full-on (and briefly)creative, Patterson refined his brand of vibrant art-house to an easy to swallow though rarely lifeless science. Though it may ring truer in its nostalgic context now than anything else, UFO still retains an out-of-body joy, even if achieved by overextending mild patterns and ambient textures."
1,wost orb cd,"This is the worst ORB Cd I have heard, It dosent sound like there other Cd's, Can I return it?"
4,Great stuff,"Very good stuff this. Perhaps not the greatest orb album, but not far off. What i want to know is what does OOBE stand FOR?? I remembered a while ago but i've forgot!"
5,"Amazing, simply, amazing","As said before, this is without a doubt the orb's best album. A great listen from the beggining.. one of the few CDs i have found i can listen from beggining to end. A very nice mix of styles, ranging from new age, to dub, to trance, and straight techno. All of course, with the unique orb-flavor. Get this CD. You will not be dissapointed."
5,A great CD,There isn't a way for me to explain how this CD is except that it's a must have. Period! The ambient Blue Room is paradise trance. Buy this!
5,An excellent book for novice and intermediate,"I feel that this book is full of useful information. Once I picked up the book i didn't set it down. It easy easy to understand and it reminds us intermediate runners about form, nutrition, and staying excited running. This book also has spots for new vocabulary, tips, warnings, and Flo-Jo's encouragement for new runners. This is an excellent book especially for the novice runner."
5,An informative find,"Back when I was in high school, Florence Griffith-Joyner was a huge inspiration for me. Since I was also a sprinter on the track team, that makes sense. After high school, I fell out of the habits I had followed and eventually abandoned them. Now I am older, and wiser, and I would like to get back into the walking/jogging routine. This is an EXCELLENT book to use as a refresher or as a starter. Flo-Jo has really wonderful tips and leads you every step of the way. No matter what fitness level you are at, this is a must if you are considering walking/jogging and/or running."
1,The only book I ever returned .............,"This is a great book if you like Flo-Jo. But if you're looking for insightful running tips and strategies, this book is only for the extreme novice. Let me sum up the book for you: stretch, run with a straight form, and breath...oh, and ofcourse consult a doctor blah blah blah."
5,Too Good to be Popular,"Walk to the XTC section of your local record store. Put on a blindfold. Pick-up and purchase any XTC CD you catch in your blindfolded snatch.A band this consistent, this creative (lyrically & musically), should surely deserve better sales... however, they are unable to massage their craft into popular.Recommendation for this CD and all others by XTC - purchase!"
2,Disappointing and often preachy,"There are 3 songs on this album that I ever listen to anymore: ""Peter Pumpkinhead,"" ""Dear Madame Barnum,"" and ""My Bird Perfroms."" The rest of the songs leave me cold. Lyrically, I found the album heavyhanded and preachy, even in ""Peter Pumpkinhead,"" which is saved by the fact that it rocks a little bit. I read in an interview one of the members saying that he was most proud of ""The Smartest Monkeys"" because it was one of the ""most subtle"" songs to date. I just laughed and laughed. ""Smartest Monkeys"" is the most heavy handed sermon I've heard in a long while.If your favorite XTC songs are along the lines of ""Senses Working Overtime,"" ""Earn Enough For Us,"" or ""Mayor of Simpleton,"" then you'll be disappointed. If you really enjoy nodding your head and saying ""yes!"" as XTC points out that there is greed and suffering in the world because of all those OTHER people, then you'll think this is a fine CD."
1,Yech...i geuss ANYTHING can get a 4 star rating here,"Yikes... I was given this CD years ago by a friend, and I just dropped by to see what kind of rating it was getting here, and my eyes almost popped out the sockets... the is THE WORST cd i have ever owned. There are only about 3 songs I can listen to on this cd that don't either put me to sleep or give me a headache. ""That Wave""? What the heck is that? It's definately not music. I truly believe that to like this CD you have to be on alot of drugs. I have never heard any of their other CD's, so I won't bash the band in general, but I know I never want to hear anything by this band ever again. I only wish I could have given it 0 stars."
2,The good news: If you like this kind of thing there is plenty of it,"Released in 1992, this is XTC's tenth album (depending on how you are counting). It was also the last XTC album for seven years. The sound quality is mediocre. It has 17 tracks and is about 62 minutes long.I liked earlier XTC work. I found this one to be lush mush. It is spineless. I don't know how people can compare this to Pet Sounds. I think people just throw out names.The 13 compositions by Andy Partridge are mostly boring and sometime cringe inducing bad smarmy pop. The 4 Colin Mouling songs have some life in them and remind me more of the earlier XTC, like Skylarking.Of course, that is just my opinion. Some people love this kind of British pop."
2,"An XTC fan, but hugely disappointed",Not at all their best effort. Feels like they needed to pay the rent or something so rushed into the studio and pushed this out. Borrow a friend's copy and listen before you buy. You'll find little or none of the infectious talent these guys bring to some of their other albums.
4,"""what's the deal?""","Although this isn't my favorite XTC album, it has some great songs. Little did we know we'd have to wait 8 years for another. My question is; I just ordered the ""remastered editions of several XTC reissues. The ""Nonsuch"" disc was a Japanese import, and not the ""caroline label"" 2002 remastered edition. What's the deal? It sounds a little fuller than the Geffen original release,but did I get cheated just because the new one may have been out of stock? Someone please tell me if there's a difference in quality or just a difference in packaging and language."
4,Their greatest,"If you like XTC and have not heard this one, get it. It inspires me in a way that only great music can. I'll never forget where I was when I first heard it. In my opinion its their most solid album overall--even better than oranges & lemons and skylarking. Yes, that good. I'm not giving it five stars because although it is remarkable, I would't call it a classic of the caliber that alters the music of its time, like Revolver or Velvet Underground or Sex Pistols, but, it is a masterpiece of the recorded pop-music art form for sure."
2,Surprisingly dated,"I probably hadn't listened to this album in at least five years, and decided to give it a listen the other day. I now realize why I always play ""Oranges And Lemons"" ""Skylarking"" and even ""Black Sea"" and never play this CD. The production and sound are very synth heavy, and all the previous comments about the ""preachiness"" of the album are very apt. The lyrics are very heavy handed, and the album really isn't much fun to listen to.I've been a huge XTC fan for many years, but the above listed albums (along with ""English Settlement,"" another favorite) are much, much better representations of the band than this one."
3,"Nice Item, Bad Packaging","I have purchased several items from this vendor and this item was GREAT, just like the rest. Only downsideis the presentation/gift box looks worse than what you would get from Target."
4,"Someone PLEASE rate this, so, I can buy it without sweating it!","Granted, These are cultured pearls instead of their most expensive cousin ""sea pearls"". Still, This set looks Beautiful and if it WERE sea pearls, you could skip it and buy 2 honda cars for the same price. No kidding, if you dont believe me, look it up!I am fine with the fact that I will never be able to get REAL sea pearls but, these are SOooo pretty...they are like the silver vs platinum! ya know. So rate them so, i can buy them! lol! thanks!"
1,Bad Movie,"WHAT A MOCKERY OF THE ORIGINAL! This movie was soooo pathetic. The story was so layed out with no detail. What happened to Wes Craven's master piece? DO NOT BUY THIS......THING! This was not supposed to be Freddy movie, believe me."
4,What a soundtrack!,"New Line have done a fantastic job remastering the Nightmare on Elm Street series for DVD, it is however the franchise that built the studio. Dream Master is a great piece of horror film-making, one of Renny Harlin's first films, which he would follow with Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger and Deep Blue Sea. It isn't my favourite in the series, that award goes to New Nightmare which found Craven in Scream Territory. The disc has a fantastic video transfer (It's never looked so good on home video) and a booming Dolby Digital 5.1 remix. But for the die hard Nightmare aficionados, the remastered Stereo Soundtrack is also included to recreate the way it sounded during it's theatrical run. I give the disc high marks for it's Video and Audio. After all, if your reading this review you've more than likely already seen the film, and it's the opinion of humble buyers like myself that matter."
3,The Worst Nightmare of them all,"Ok I am a big freddy fan, but this movie just didnt hit as well as well with me as the previous ones did. The first of all my complaints is the acting with the exception of alice she is the only reason i gave this film 3 stars. Anyway The remaining survivors from 3 are killed of and Kirsten passes her power to alice so she can pull people into her dreams. As her friends start dying off in particular Freddy fashion She faces him in the ultimate showdown between good and bad. P.S Another reason this movie got three stars was because of the cool cockroach death. Rated R for mild violence, language and partial nudity"
1,2nd worst of the series,Besides A nightmare on Elm Street 2 freddy's Revenge this is the worst of the series. Horrible Acting. I wouldn't even compare this to part 3.
2,Campy horror with no plot.,"Freddy comes back from the grave and starts killing off a bunch of teens including a kid that looks like Fat Albert. This is a dark comedy and has some interesting imagery in the style of labrynth but not much.The scene where the girl gets turned into a roach was disgusting and very creative. There is a scene where one of the guys gets turned into a part of a pizza and then he gets eaten by Freddy, that was funny.This movie has no plot and has some lame scenes like when one of the kids turns into a karate kid and tries to fight off Freddy (yawn that was boring).There is not too much violence and gore in this one. The limited amount of gore in this movie is cheesy.Also I like how Freddy has funny one liners. I thought Freddy's Dead was a bit more interesting and wild than this one. I still have yet to see the other Elm street movies but when I do I will give a review on here."
4,RUNNING FROM THIS NIGHTMARE!,"Freddy kruger finally returns and kills all of the kids who survived part 3.Now Kristen's friends must learn about Freddy and kill him again.Alice is one of Kristen's best friends.After Kristen brings Alice into her dream,she meets Freddy.""HOW SWEET....FRESH MEAT!""When Alice wakes up she runs over to Kristne's house and she is dead!Burnt alive.Now the Dream master,I mean Alice,is the only one who knows whats going on.Can she kill the demented Freddy Kruger or will she fail and die?FIND OUT!THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST IN THE SERIES.""WELCOME TO WONDER LAND,ALICE!"""
4,One and All for Freddy,If you have seen any one of the nightmare on elm street's then you must see the rest. They are all time classic horror movies. Freddy is one af the characters everyone tries to base their horror killers on but it just doesn't work he is a legend and a god.If you have seen one other Nightmare on elm streets then get this one to you'll love it.
3,O.K.,Part 4 is an ok horror movie that has the biggest body count of all the Nightmare on Elm Street movies. The kids that survived Part 3 are back in school with a new pack of kids that Freddy will tear apart. They don't last. Freddy easily kills the first two dream warriors and is set to kill Kristen when Kristen gives her powers to kill Freddy to a new Nightmare heroine Alice. Freddy is more of a comedian then ever. In my opinion he cracked one two many one-liners in this film and not enough time trying to be scary. That is my biggest complaint of this film. It doesn't try to be scary. It just tries to show us another Freddy film with no real reason to do so. Alot of the deaths that Freddy commits in this film are quite original and some are just plain gross(like the cockroach girl). Robert England and Lisa Wilcox are great as the villain and hero. This film also has the most gory Freddy kill. You will actually see the soles that Freddy keeps inside him rip out of the clawed killer.
2,You could easily fall asleep hrough this.,"This is the last Nightmare On Elm Street film I'd show to a hater of the series to try and convert them. It's filled with everything the critics hate about Freddy films. For a start the special effects seem to have been deemed more important than any kind of decent script. Freddy is no more than a wise-cracking clown, the sets are garish and any suspence is swiftly killed off by painful over-acting. The ending is very good special-effects-wise, but plot-wise it's the feeblest (anti)climax I've ever seen in a horror film. The heroine shows Freddy has reflction! What is he, Medusa the Gorgan? Freddy had actually already seen his reflection in this film in some shining barbells, so the whole scene just falls flat on its face. If you're a fan of Freddy films then there's a few memorable moments, but this is more of a teen idol film than a horror film, the series producers obviously milking every last drop from the Freddy character."
3,"NOT AS GOOD AS PART 3, BUT STILL ENTERTAINING! 2 1/2 STARS!","I am reviewing the entire Nightmare on Elm Street series, but not this DVD release. I own the box set and I wanted to do individual reviews for each film.By now the ""Nightmare"" franchise is replacing scares for laughs, but it does deliver some good FX moments. Robert Englund has played the character so many times he can do it in his sleep! The DVD transfer is very good on this entry and the disc has some cool goodies to check out."
3,"ENJOYABLE SEQUEL,BUT NOT THAT GOOD.",This movie had some great moments and special effects but it lacked the dark flavor of the previous sequels.This is the real beginning of the comic freddy krueger and some of the characters I didnt really care for.I cant say that the movie was bad but I cant really say that the movie was great.Some people may really like this movie but I prefer the previous sequels to this one.PEACE OUT.
3,OK SEQUEL,"THIS IS ABOUT AS GOOD AS THEY COULD'VE DONE WIT THIS ONE. IN THIS ONE, FREDDY GETS REVIVED BY FLAMING URINE AND HE FINALLY KILLS ALL THE KIDS OF ELM STREET, AS HE GETS BORED, HE LOOKS FOR NEW KIDS TO KILL. GOOD SPECIAL EFFECTS AND A GOOD ENDING REALLY SAVES THIS ONE FROM BEING MEDIOCRE. UP BY THIS POINT, THE SERIES WAS REALLY BEGINNING TO SHOW ITS AGE."
3,good,not as good as 3 but acceptable. Same body count as 3. all the elm street kids die(dang it) and some new kids Freddy can have fun with. If you see the other ones you have to see this one.
1,Uninspired and uninspiring.,"A lot of people like this. I can't quite understand why. The makers of this film admitted that all they did was film a lot of special-effects sequences and then find any old excuse to cobble them together. It's a shame that Wes Craven's original idea for this film, involving time-travel in dreams, wasn't used. Instead all we get is special-effects and nothing else, just some tosh about Kristen (quite obviously played by a different actress, her character also completely different) giving her dream powers to somebody.Unmemorable sequel, Freddy now about as scary as a court jester. There's an excellent soundtrack, but it's completely wasted on this dross."
3,Strangely good and brighter than the others,"Freddy Kreuger is back yet again. Brought back to life by the lead character from part III and sets out to kill the last of the Elm Street kids (not again) but nearly a half a dozen new victims. Like three, the special effects are great and the characters are thick enough to survive the teenage acting syndrome. But we're getting sick and tired of the same old routine."
4,Not exactly good...but definitely enjoyable!,"While NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 4 is by no means a good movie (it does not compare to one, three or seven in terms of writing, etc.), it is enormously entertaining. It is also total eye-candy. The special effects and sets are awesome, and the dream sequences are more surreal than in previous NIGHTMARE flicks.I know it's bad, but I can watch it over and over again, unlike 5 and 6 where I could barely get through the first viewings."
3,"Too much comedy, too little horror","""A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master"" is a much more lighter film in the series that doesn't seem to take itself seriously at all. Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) gets resurrected by flaming dog urine(!) and kills off the remaining Dream Warriors from Part 3. One of them, Kristen Parker (Tuesday Knight), transfers her gift to her friend Alice (Lisa Wilcox) and the killing starts again for a new breed of Elm Street kids. Now, the pros: the visuals are outstanding, very stylish film, with lots of color, light and great special effects. The cons: The acting stinks, except for Lisa Wilcox's. Freddy cracks too many one liners. The murders are stupid (girl being turned into a cockroach? ). A pizza with faces on it? What happened to the sinister, dark Freddy from the first film? It seems he is non-existant in this entry. Luckily, things get a little darker in the next installment and in Part 7. This is for fans of the series only."
3,pretty good,"A good sequel with a good plot, just a bit short of 3. still very good movie, worthy to be in the series"
5,gorey fun,very cool a nice mix of humor wit and gore although body counts not as high as usual; its still good
3,"""Welcome to Prime Time!""","This installment in the Nightmare series did exactly that. The highest grossing film of the series also has the most laughs. Really the only two complaints I have about the movie is the reincarnation of Freddy(flaimin' dog wiz!)and Freddy's makeup. Freddy's make up in this film at times looks very dull and not as bright as the other films.I have all the movies on vhs and now I own the dvd set, I enjoy both eminsley. Feel free to email me on any questions about the series, I'm sure I'll be able to help.P.s. Only bad thing about the soundtrack is that Tuesday Knight's opening theme isnt on it."
2,unworthy sequel,A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 is not very good in my opinion. The plot gets cheesy and very unrealistic to the point of boredum. I only give this movie a second star because the first part of the movie holds your interest to a certain point. You won't miss out on anything by not watching this film.
4,Good.,This is a good 4th Nightmare movie but this movie has too much comedy to it. Hard to believe that this was the highest grossing Nightmare On Elm Street in the series. The story continues from the third one with the three original cast members alive except there is a different Kristen. When the original three die I am left wondering what is the use of these movies anymore but they found ways to make more. The movie was made in 1988 and made 49 million dollars. I recommend this movie but it isn't scary try the Third or the First ones.
3,A rather average entry,"Freddy [Robert Englund, Doing what he does best] is revived by flaming dog urine and after killing all of the survivors from the original film, It's up to Alice [Lisa Wilcox] to put a stop to Freddy's new reign of terror before he kills everyone on elm street. This is an ok sequel. Freddy is fun to watch in action as always and there is a pretty good story here, But i was dissapointed in the lack of quality acting in this one [Which is a shame because part 3 had the greatest cast of all the nightmare movies]. This makes for a good weekend movie to watch. Does feature a couple of memorable murder scenes. Fans of the series should be able to endure this one."
4,"Seven, eight, gonna stay up late!!!!!!!!","Nancy's dead, but the Elm Street kids from Westin Hills, Kristin, Kincaid, and Joey all live to fight another battle, or do they? Along in the battle are some new faces. Kristin's boyfriend Rick, Rick's sister Alice, Alice's boyfriend Dan, Sheila, and Debbie. Resurrected from the grave once again, Freddy comes back to wreak havoc upon those who dare to dream, but this time Kristin loses the battle. Alice somehow obtains the powers of all her friends after their death. A remarkable gift, but it is not explained how she got it in the movie. One by one Freddy is slaying and Alice has to defeat Freddy and release the tortured souls of his victims all in 99 min!I am a fan of Renny Harlins, who directed this movie, and others such as Cliffhanger, The Long Kiss Goodnight, Excorcist: The Beginning, and Driven, but I was not a big fan of this Nightmare."
3,Good but not great,"its a fairly good movie, I liked that all the Elm Street kids finally died because now he can move on, and it makes sense but they couldve got some better actors because the actors they got were horrible, and Tuesday Knight looked nothing like Patricia Arquete, and her acting was an embarassment to all the Kruger movies and she couldnt even scream right"
2,"*Fun, But Not Scary","I bought this one recently becauseI was a huge Freddy fan as a kid andwanted to revise the ol' collection. Butbeing the Horror freak that I am, Icouldn't see this one as scary. I thoughtit was O.K. Just a fun fantasy movie,nothing Scary or morbid. Buy this one ifyou want a good chuckle. Not to be terrified.The 1st and 2nd Nighmare movies are the best. Dark,Spooky, scary, gothic, morbid, gross, bloody etc.Parts 4, 5, Freddy's Dead and A New Nightmareare just trying Wayyy too hard to keep thefranchise going. In fact I never ever saw the last twoinstallments until just recently because I thoughtback then they'd 'becheesy'. My thoughts were correct, I couldn't evenfinish watching them."
2,"Boring, but not the worst in the series","If you're a fan of the NOES series, you'll probably end up seeing this one, but let me tell you, it's the same plot they've been using since the original. It's sad. To the point: to rate this movie is hard, but all you have to do is compare it to the rest of the series, and compared to #5: The Dream Child, it's way better. Don't be fooled, this is still a real bore!"
2,Not that good coulda been better!,Not a good dvd no elm street DvD has ever been cool no deleatedscenes!!Bull!!!!!!!!!
2,"Decent acting, but series should have been laid to rest.","What really bothered me about this one was the way they killed all three surviving charecters from part 3 off, especially right at the beggining. To have the series end with DREAM WARRIORS would have been a perfectly fitting way to finish the story. (After all, didn't Freddy's mother, Amanda, say that the way to put him to rest was by giving him a proper burial?) Instead, Freddy returns, this time revived by dog piss, and kills off the last three elm street kids whom Nancy Thompson sacraficed herself to protect, and who had fought so hard to save each other in the last film. The lesson seems to be that you will really defeat evil. You may succed in slowing it down, but it will always return and get you in the end."
1,Poopy,The next installment was really bad. I really didn't like the actors or the plot. It got really boring at the part where Alice was driving in circles.
2,Just a rehash of the original,"If only the redhead in this movie really was a 'dream master' and could fight Freddy in dreams. It might have been interesting then. Instead she's just the main character who gets to survive until the ending.Freddy comes back, kills off the survivors from the third movie and then moves on to the rest of them. From then it's all the same. A character fights off sleep, goes to sleep. Freddy shows up, says a few one liners and the character dies. A few of the characters try to fight, but they are pretty vacant and the ""I don't believe in you"" tactic no longer works like it did in the first one. Eventually Freddy gets put back into the hereafter and somehow we are supposed to cheer on the redhead who puts him there, or something like that.The only reason I give it two stars is that it has some cute lines and if you watch it like a dark comedy it's not so bad, but it really shows the rut into which the series fell."
2,The worst in the series,"Freddy finally wastes the rest of the elm street kids and now goes looking for new victims. As always, a couple of good killings, but also quite number of hopeless ones. The acting is nothing impressive, Freddy's wise cracking is becoming a bit too repetive, and the way Freddy is resurrected is laughable. This is probably the only one I would say is not worth a look at, this one and maybe ""Freddy's Dead""."
2,I didn't like the 4th,"Hi, I wanna say that the best nightmare on Elm street movie's the 3rd and the worst's the 4th... I didn't like this movie... It seems that Sheila (Toy Newkirk) was really dead on the tray of shooting of this movie, is it true???"
2,Surely Part 3 was intended as the last one.,"The climax of this film demonstrates what the rest of it is like. There are several thousand flashy special effects as a result of the heroine Alice doing no more than showing Freddy his reflection (he'd actually seen his reflection in this film already in some shiny barbells). The camera-work and special effects are all very show-offy, but they fail to hide the weakest plot ever to (dis)grace a N on ES film and a complete lack of scaryness or suspence. Freddy is now no more than a wise-cracking comic-book villain and most of his victims just come across as unsympathetic and often over-the-top."
2,NIGHTMARE...I DON'T THINK SO!,O.k so Nightmare 3 was good but when 4 came along I was not suprised when I was not intrigued. It was o.k. I think it gets a bit stupid when they keep pulling each other into their dreams. It is neither scary or as original as the others. One bit which I though was good was when the main character is in her class. She falls asleep as does her friend and BANG...heres FREDDY!. O.k movie. Give it go if you liked the other Nightmare movies. Just don't expect to be scared.
4,Took his funny moments and terrors and ran away 4 a while!,"This just mixed everthing you could ever imagine..... by Freddy! This just shows the sequals dont have to give up what they show in the first! For example, in the 3rd he becomes a comedian and i good scream but he does not give all that up in this! He stays pretty much the same way. Awsome killing stages! Have to admit not as great as teh 3rd!... fyi :Dream Wariors. After you see it you'll wish you dog peed fire and reaurected you relatives. Dont not see it by that coment! k? k."
4,Elm Street 4...an excellent sequel,"While 1 was scary, 2 bit the big one, 3 and 4 got it right. I liked the mix of characters in part 4. It gave a somewhat interesting storyline and actual characters to watch. Not the usual let's see what idiot gets whacked next. Although part 5 was fair it didn't live up to the expectations set in 4. However, the rest sucked after 5. I thought wes craven was done for at tht point; then lo and behold he conjured up the magic again in the Scream series."
3,A good installment in the series,"After the surprisingly good Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors, New Line once again resurrected Freddy Kruger to wreak bloody havoc. The Dream Master finds our three survivors from Dream Warriors all getting picked off by a newly revived Freddy; and introduces us to Alice who now has Kristen's powers and poses a threat to Freddy. Director Renny Harlin (Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger) upped Part 3's ante with even more elaborate, gorey, and macabre set pieces and deaths; some of which are the best in the series. However, this is where Freddy stopped being scary and became the one liner spewing fiend that he is known (and loved) for; but either way Robert Englund is still a joy to watch as everyone's favorite razor clawed killer. Dream Master also lacks the character development and coherent (well, more or less) storytelling that most of the other installments contained, but on it's own this is a pretty solid horror flick."
3,Good (But Running Out of Steam By This Point),"While ""Dream Warriors"" was the superior sequal (and the best entry in the entire series!), this installment was nice nevertheless. There ARE problems with the script (well to be specific, there WAS no REAL script just pages of various scenes no joke!) Yes, Freddy is TOO goofy,the new characters aren't as interesting as the ""Dream Warriors"" cast and the his resurrection was just silly,but the film does succeed in making an entertaining entry and gives an early look at what Renny Harlin will give audiences in the upcoming years! I DO recommend this film to any fan of the ""Nightmare"" series wanting to simply sit down for 90 minutes and enjoy a good b-movie!"
4,PURE EVIL NEVER REALLY DIES!,"Proving there's no rest for the wicked,the unspeakable,evil Freddy Krueger(RobertEnglund)is again resurrected from the grave to wreak havoc upon those who dare to dream.But this time,he faces a powerful new adversary!As her friends succumb one by one to Freddy's wrath,telephathically gifted Kristen(TuesdayKnight) embarks on a desperate mission to destroy the dream stalker and release the souls of his victms once and for all.After Kristen gets killed her friend Alice(LisaWilcox)is the world's only hope.Alice now has Kristen's powers she is a DREAM MASTER.After Alice's friends start to die including her older brother,Alice prepares to fight the deadly killer for the last time.After Alice kills Freddy she goes home to her boyfriend. But is he really dead?WELCOME TO WONDERLAND ALICE! Rated R brief nudity,violence,and language."
4,one two Freddy's coming 4 you!,A follow up to DREAM WARRIORS. It took me ages to get this film but when I got it I enjoyed it. What I did'nt like was the fact Freddy is now TOO wisecracking which makes him unable to take seriously. Renny Harlin later went on to direct DEEP BLUE SEA but this is what I'll remember him by. The ending to this film was effective. Immensly entertaining.
3,This band touched me,"I saw Red Metric play at the Norva a few years ago. The band touched me, and by touched I mean physically groped me...the drummer in particular.Just thinking about it makes me feel like when I used to climb the rope in gym class."
2,Not easy to dance to,I was so disappointed with this dance video! It is so confusing and not fun at all. She will say in the video now go to your right and she is going left and I don't know which way to go. When she says dance to the left she is going to the right. They should have done this video in front of a mirror. Big disappointment.
2,A pain in the [butt],"I have had one of these for weeks and have had Hell's own time trying to get it to work with Win2K. When it is kind enough to let itself be installed, it stops woring when I restart. I got complex instructions from SanDisk support involving a registry edit and it failed again. Now they are telling me I need to use it with a powered hub. I bought one, and I will try it, but for now it is an expensive paperweight."
4,Twins love it! Surprisingly informative for adults,"My twin toddlers' find Dave's antics hilarious - especially as Bus Driver Dave. The aircraft carrier footage always prompts a ""wooooowwww"". No matter how many times they see it. Bonus that there's a female pilot(Although there's some weird reference from the commander about staying off drugs to join the Navy...) Adults won't be utterly bored like some kids videos. You can tell kids helped make this series."
1,there goes a train,"I bought this dvd for my grandson because he loves airplanes and trains. Too much commentary and very little action shots of trains and airplanes. It did not keep his interest, a total waste of money."
1,"Proceed with caution: This should be titled ""All About Dave""","The train footage on this movie is quite nice, but not nice enough to cover the extremely iritating, camera-hogging, mugging(poor attempt at acting) that comprises way too much of this movie.Fortunately, I didn't pay much for this movie--should have known when the same man is actor/writer/producer/director----some really terrible jokes, too much explanation of how the mechanics work, and way too many close-ups of Dave's face. Really, complicated boiler explanations for a 3 year old?I did also agree that the scene of the woman trapped in her car on the tracks was quite upsetting for my 3 yo grandson.Save your money-my advice is pass on anything created by Dave Hood."
1,These are the worst ever!,"Just show the real machines working, forget all the goofy narration that is annoying to adults and doesn't even hold my son's interest. He much prefers the Fred Levine series or the I Love CAT Machines series."
1,Scratched DVD,"When I received the DVD it was so scratched up that it would hardly play in the DVD player. I put it in my DVD cleaner and scratch remover, but it is to badly scratched up."
5,Hmmmm..........................Looks VERY good!!!!!,I am planning to sell my old videotapes and save my money for this DVD.
4,Silly Fun and Somewhat Educational,"I agree with some of the reviewers of other ""Real Wheels"" adventures -- Dave IS annoying.... but hey, I'm not his target audience. My trainiac son thinks Dave is hilarious and he loves this series -- good enough for me. It's clean, silly fun and he learns a few things at the same time. At 4 years old he's beginning to move on to some other series (Popular Mechanics for Kids -- an excellent choice for slightly older kids) but that may just be because he's been watching these for 2 years already and is ready for something new. Hard Hat Harry is another good choice for kids 2 to 6 years old or so who love vehicles of any kind. Somehow I find those a little more entertaining and informational than the Real Wheels series, but that may just be personal preference."
5,Excellent book,I recently bought quite a few books on QoS and I would strongly recommend this. This book is very easy to read and covers most of the topics in details.
1,Internet Performance Survival Guide.,"I allready put up 2 reviews and I don't appreciate them being taken off by amazon because I highly believe that this book is BADDDDDD! Amazon I know your trying to sell as many books as possible but you ever hear of a thing called free speech?? If your gonna only post positive reviews then don't bother even having people put up what they think about the books. Geoff Houston might be a smart guy and all but this book??, my god what was he thinking writing something that puts people asleep every single line of his text? Overall a BAD book, do not recommend to anyone."
2,Not for beginners,"This video is hard to follow especially if you are beginning sign language. You have the word shown on the left side of the screen, a picture in the upper corner and the person signing on the right side of the screen so you have to look on the left for the word/words or in the upper left corner for the picture while the person is signing on the right side of the screen. Sometimes you may not catch all the sign because you are reading the word and/or words, or the word is signed to fast. The sign is only made once and if you don't catch it the first time you will have to replay. You will need to have some experience under your belt before using this video. I do not recommend it for beginners. Also, there is no spoken sound on this video(only music)so you cannot rely on hearing a word, you have to be able to read or look at the picture. You must also know the alphabet in sign languare because some of the words or pictures are simple spelled out. No specific sign is given."
5,Adorable Michigan Garden Gnome,I purchased this gnome as a Xmas gift for my son-in-law. Can't wait for him too see it! He is a huge fan of the Michigan Wolverines. I know he will love it as much as I do. The gnome is adorable and will bring a big smile to my son-in-law! He will appreciate the little guy giving him added support during his roaring cheers!!! A must have for a loyal fan!
5,Granite-A Story of a Land and its People,"As a resident of Granite and a member of the Granite Ward I found this to be very informative as to the early history Granite as well as the early leadership of the Granite Ward. However, I recognize it would have limited value to those outside of our community."
2,Surprisingly disappointing!,"I would have thought such an assemblege would offer a penetrating debate,fencing, interweaving,deconstructing and reconstructing each other,and all the time illuminating. Instead I found a bunch of men talking at each other ."
2,Very poorly pieced together,"I went back and forth quite a bit about whether or not to give this one 2 or 3 stars, but after running through it again I decided I had to go with the lower. There is a bit of good information here, but it is overshadowed by the choppy editing job and the writer's less than satisfactory grasp of the English language. The film goes off on many short tangents as well that add nothing to the story, a whole lot of speculation is presented as absolute fact, and quite a bit of information that is used is just flat out wrong. If you are dead set on watching a documentary about Belle this is just about your only choice, but there are plenty much better documentaries about similar subjects available if you are just looking for 19th or early 20th century murders."
3,Good Stuff,"This is a good record. It is a bit common within the context of Durutti. It just doesn't stand out when compared to ""The Guitar and Other Machines"" for example. For folks just starting up with Durutti I would say that the aforementioned title, ""Vini Reilly"", and/or ""Someone Else's Party"" would be better starting points."
2,Scratching the surface,"A couple of things are not very hard in Emacs. Once you have a new major-mode, it's pretty easy to figure out how it works, by pressing C-h b or C-h m. This book is about the easy stuff; it covers a lot of major- and minor modes. However, it hardly tells you anything at all about the way Emacs is structured and configured. And that is one of the hardest things to figure out when you're starting to use Emacs. (I know by experience, I had to go through quite some pain before I was able to work with it properly.)So if you want more verbose explanations of major Emacs modes, this is the book you want. If you want to figure out how to customize stuff to your needs, this is not the book you want."
4,"A great tool, a good introduction","Emacs is not just a text editor. It is a true power tool, first of its class and still the best. This book uncovers the full range of emacs capabilities in a friendly and competent manner. It abandons the traditional Meta key terminology in favor of the ESC key binding, a terrible decision that just adds to the confusion. I can overlook this flaw in the book, but it is unacceptable in the companion pocket reference."
3,easy things lengthily described,"The title ""learning GNU Emacs is deceiving"". It is an introduction to Emacs.If you plan to use Emacs for software development, it is definitively not sufficient.Moreover, while introducing a feature, the author think useful to write a full paragraph to explain you why you need it (for instance, why you need the command UNDO).The positive point is that the features discussed are explained step by step so that you are sure that if you read the whole section you will understand and be able to reproduce.Finally ""GNU Emacs Manual"" by R Stallman is the reference an Emacs user will need."
5,One of my favorite movie.,"Because is really hard to find, I was so glad I found here it's a great movie, with lot of fun and great for any kid."
4,Movie,"I wanted to purchase this movie because its one of my family's fav..I made the purchase here on AMAZON, recieved it pretty quickly..Once I opened it, I didnt like the fact it didn't come in its original case..I'm very picky and I like to keep the original cases to my purchases..but besides thata, the movie is in great condition and we've already watched it quite a couple times. Overall Im happy!!"
5,I love it!,"I am a sucker for older movies, and this was a great buy that I couldnt pass up. Cheap price and the product came very fast! The movie was sealed and not scratched. Could not have got a better deal anywhere else."
2,For Adults Only!!!,"I would not recomend this for any children, especially the very young. I was very upset when I played this in our van for my son who will be 3 in a couple months. The entire movie is about hateing and name calling. My son started saying some of it. I don't remember the origional show being like that. If you are a mom that wants your kid to grow up a nice young man then do not get this movie. I don't want him to see stuff like this cause he learns to act that way and of course he loves this movie. I need to find another movie about kids. Kids that act respectful."
1,Only for kids.,"The Little Rascals is one of those movies that can only be enjoyed by kids. Most adults will find this movie boring and almost unwatchable, (I gave up watching after half an hour). However, if you are an adult and you like it, fine. But I think I speak for the majority when I say it's ""only for kids""."
5,The Most Adorable Movie Ever!!!,"I Love This Movie.I think that this is the Most Cutest & Adorable Movie Ever!And plus I have this movie at home.This movie has alot of cute kids in this movie is Spanky,Stymie Buckwheat,PorkyAlfalfa & Darla.I thought that was so cute when Darla & Alfalfa kissed in this movie.This movie is Funny & it's the Best!!!"
2,not very accurate,"this movie is way different from the series which came out in the 1940's. there wasn't any rich kid wooing darla, and they never said anything nonsense on the shows like they did on this movie. this movie sucks. this is the first thing to score a two-star review from me. for a good movie from 1994, buy the flintstones or the mask, but not this joke."
2,The cameo's are nice,"This movie was pretty lame on acting and storyline. Most actors in this movie are very unknown, the only one I recognized was Blake McIver Ewing, who was in some other movies like one of the ""Problem Child"" movies, and had occassional roles as Derek in the hit sit-com ""Full House"". But the most fun in this movie were the many many cameos. There were very small roles for big stars as Mell Brooks (""Spaceballs""), Mary-Kate & Ashley Olsen (""Full House""), Whoopi Goldberg (""Sister act"") and many others."
1,Horrible!!!,dvd was scratched and dirty. Skip's during the whole thing. The inside of the case is broken. The movie was supposed to be in good condition but looks like it came right out of a toddlers sticky hands. There was literally food on the front of the disk. The movie should of never been sold. This is why I will never shop on amazon again. do not buy from this seller unless you want damage food covered products.!!!!!
3,not the originals,I thought I had the Little Rascals Our gang... this is a new version... my granddaughter like it she is two so hopefully we will get some use out of it... just not what I wanted... I will be looking close next time...it came allot quicker then it said... I will go back and get the gang from my time...
2,"Not bad, but no match for the original","When Spanky McFarland was asked if they should remake ""Our Gang"", he said no because he felt they got it right the first time. Wise man, that Spanky. While this is not bad for children or adults, why not just buy the originals instead? Basically all they've done here was take several of the original films, such as ""Mail and Female"" and ""Rushin' Ballet"", and string them together as a movie. Another problem I had was the clash of time periods - the characters dress like the originals and engage in the same types of activities, yet the film obviously takes place in the 1990's. Children simply don't build go-carts or wear bowties anymore. Why not just fully update the gang into the 1990's or make this a period piece instead? At best, this is a colorful, cute and lively romp, but nothing more."
5,Classic!,Can't wait to watch this with my little ones! Amazon offers a great price and endless inventory on hard to find movies.
5,great,"good review, came on time, in good shape, followed description. would purchase from this person or people again dkl kl nkl nkl nkl jkl"
1,BURN THIS FILM!,"This movie is horrible. The kids are worse than zombies! Obviously anyone who likes this drivel has never seen the real ""Our Gang"" kids. May the fools who tried to remake a classic(in every sense of the word)kids series into a feature film burn in Hell and be forever tormented by having to watch their tired attempt at filmmaking. Whenever I hear someone saying that they liked this movie I have to spit! Ptooey!!!"
4,Enjoyable Fun Little Movie,"New interpretations of some classic Our Gang bits, a few cameos and decent production value. Its a fun little movie and the kids are fun to watch. They're poor actors, just like the originals, although the Spanky and Alfalfa that people remember from the late 30s were probably more polished than any of these kids.My only complaint is the DVD edition seems to be the same edited version as the old VHS. There are a few gags that are either incomplete, or missing altogether, but you can kind of tell where they belong (like the gentlemen walking into the bank). There is also a funny extended trial scene that is much abbreviated in this version. I remember seeing the missing scenes on TV oddly enough. If they ever re-release this movie I hope it will be a more complete edit."
5,Enjoyable,My daughter loves this! She's watched it three times in 48 hours! Glad I purchased this for her and her friends to watch.
4,Great remake,Funny stuff for the whole family. Everyone will enjoy this movie. The producers did a Great job. Feels just like the old ones.
5,Christmas present for my son,Well my son saw this movie on abc family and hbo. He kept begging me to see it over and over again and I have to admit that I love this movie myself. I couldn't find it in stores at the time so I purchased it online and it gets played non stop!!! He know the whole movie and his favorite part is alfafa's letter to darla.
4,Little Rascals Movie,"This is a delightful movie for families. If you like the ""old"" Little Rascals, you will like this as well."
4,Past meets present and it's a score !!!,I loved it.... It really captured the feel of the original are gang. For my daughter. Ever little boy or girl should own it
5,Great movie,"My 6 year old granddaughter and I saw this movie on tv, and then I found it at Amazon for her. She loves watching it REPEATEDLY and has been sharing it with her friends who also love watching it REPEATEDLY. Very good childrens movie. All of the characters really look like the origional Little Rascals or as I grew up calling them OUR GANG."
5,"Love it, love it, love it!","This movie is one of my favorites from when I was a kid. I still love it to this day. I never saw the original, so I have nothing to compare it to, but I'm one of the adults who actually likes it. I find myself laughing through the whole thing and my son likes it, too. :) Definitely one of my favs!"
4,Cooking With Gas,"In Little Rascals, Alfalfa is full of farfegnugen, but he sure can sing! Isn't Darla just the luckiest girl in the world? Alfalfa faces some competition though in this film from a refined young man who has googly eyes for Darla. It's unfortunate that the clubhouse of the He-man Woman Hater's Club gets caught in the flames of love and burns down. (It helps to know the number for 911 in case of emergency.)The romantical Alfalfa is torn between his pals and Darla. His best friend Spanky doesn't make it easy on him. Acts of rivalry between Alfalfa and the refined Waldo, whose wealthy father just bought the oil refinery, continue and hits its apex in a go-kart race with a wild driving scene. After certain events, the He-man Woman Haters Club rethinks their club membership rules. There are special appearances in this movie by Mel Brooks, very young Mary-Kate and Ashley, Daryl Hannah, Lea Thompson, Whoopi Goldberg, Raven Simone, Reba McEntire and Donald Trump."
4,"Sure the old little rascals were cute,but so are these guys!","I love this movie! It's really cute! I wouldn't recomend it to fans of the old little rascals though, it may not reach their standards. For any kid this movie is hillarious!"
4,General Knowledge about jazz bass,"I found this book to be a very well put together collection of what seems to be magazine arcticles and short biographies.If you ever looked at the back of your jazz CDs and wondered who those bass players were, this book will be a nice read. It has a short biography of the most important jazz bass players, with some short transcriptions of their style.It has also some interesting arcticles on technique, exercices, theory and bass playing in general. The CD is well done, it has some examples and some songs.I don't think this book will teach anyone to play bass and I don't think that's the book's intention anyway, but it will broaden your horizons. This book made me a more well informed player, helped me to put the music I play into context and gave me lots of food for thought.Good reading."
5,No Matter How Small - An Indenspensible Guide For NICU Parents,"No Matter How Small: A Parents' Guide to Preterm Development""No Matter How Small"" is a must have for every parent with a baby in the NICU. The DVD offers developmental guidance on preemies with clear examples as well as inspiring stories of real families.""No Matter How Small"" can help you, the NICU parent, over some of the bumps you face now and after your baby is discharged. Every NICU should offer this to their families.This is the only program of its kind, and it is fantastic!"
5,Believe the hype...,"This is a REALLY good book! The Marvel novels were on a little roll here, and this one keeps the ball rollin'! Mr. Golden has really done fine work (again). He seems like one of the few writers who wrote these books to truly ""get"" the characters they are writing about...go figure. Just about every character gets some backstory, to help you truly understand them, and they each have distinct characteristics that set them apart from each other (save for a few of the Acolytes, but oh well). Great job, and I look forward to the rest of the trilogy..."
4,music and singing great - staging Uh Uh Uh,"I am happy to have this opera because it is the only one. But I am too old and senile to see the point (and expense incurred) hanging the piano over the stage. Claiming it symbolizes something about art means that they probably do not realize that the real are involved in ths sining, music and appropriate stage and costumes - not some stupid attention grabber. To me it would have been a much better opera in reasonable costumes and without the stupid piano. But still enjoyed it. I can see some excuse for eurotrashing an opera that has been seen thousands times and you think people are bored with it in its original form, but not this one which has not been around."
4,Many valid points,"This book had many valid points, and seems to be on target in a lot of areas. The author does not take the route that says we need to make specific changes. No two marriages are exactly the same, so blanket advice is often not valid. Her approach is to simply inform, and allow you to take the next step(s)."
5,A Must-Have Book For Every Wife,"This book helped me understand my husband in new ways. And, my husband confirmed that Shaunti is right on with her research.This book has truly enriched our marriage."
4,Informed Wife,The book was just as instructional and informative to my husband as much as it was to me. It helped to put language to some of the things he had not been able to express to me. It was very insightful and I enjoyed reading it very much.
3,Just Okay,"I bought these for me and the hubby...almost everything she talks about we either already do or have already been told. Awesome for a woman who's never heard any of this before. Just take what you want from it...each man is different.It got on my nerves to no end how on the CD, the author is almost whining and sounds like she's about to cry when talking about/reading aloud the men's responses. Ugh. Stop it! Just talk normally!!"
3,for women only,"This book was a very quick read, and interesting. The data that was presented for men's behaviors easily applied to women and vice versa, so I can't say that I learned anything exceptional. This would be a good book for a young adult, late teen. 17 and up, but it's a little immature for someone say, 25 or older, in my opinion."
4,self help,"This book was interesting, but did not have any information that you wouldn't know if you are a considerate person and treat a partner the way you would like to be treated yourself."
3,Good book,"This is a good book on the topic. I'd recommend Love & Respect, which this author references, as a better book and one that couples can read together to understand each other. This one is a bit light but still worth the read."
4,Great insight,"Finally, a book about man that's not just what some woman thinks! The idea that this woman got a professional surveyer to come in and survey men, in addition to her one-on-one interviews to try and understand them is amazing. Extremely well-written, dealing with some rather difficult issues for us women to face at times, but great insight into how the male mind works."
5,Bride-to-be,I am about to get married and was given this book. It is one of the best gifts I could have been given. I am so thankful to have this insight into the inner workings of my fiance before we even begin our marriage. I definitely encourage this book to read and to give.
1,kindle book more expensive than hard cover,Why why why? Is the author trying to get rid of excess inventory? Buy it used for $3; that at least is recycled (reused) paper.
4,For Women Only; what you need to know about the inner lives of men,"Informative, eye-opening, insightful, and useful."
5,Well Researched and Well Written,"For Women Only is well researched and well written - a rare combination. It leads to better understanding which leads to better actions which lead to better marriages and relationships. This book and its companion, For Men Only, are must read books on this topic. Every married couple should read them. Others will benefit as well as they learn to better understand and appreciate the differences between men and women."
5,Perfect,This study is perfect and practical. In your face and uncompromising but written without condescension or condemnation. She provides practical application to your marriage.
4,Illuminating,I wish I had read this book before I got married. I already recommended this to a friend who was interested in similar books. I'm thinking of purchasing For Women Only in the Workplace as well.
5,Eye opener,Eye opener...that is all I can say about the book.It is detailed and backed up with statistics about how men really are.I cried when I read the first page of the last chapter...very sincere and true....Will recommend it to any couple struggling in their relationship...
1,Garbage! I'm embarrassed this in my purchase history,"This is garbage. I wish I could get my money and time back. This is a book for Christian relationships and nowhere does it say that on the cover or the synopsis. The book is filled with references to Jesus, God and everyone the author surveyed was from a religious community. I actually listened to the entire audio book out of sheer curiosity about how dumb this author. My fiance and I had a nice laugh about how ridiculous this book is. The book focuses on having women constantly adjust themselves to meet men's needs. The book is written from the point of view of a world in which women do not work and are generally self-involved and out of touch with their partner's needs. Do not waste your money on this absurdity."
3,for women only what you need toknow about the innerlives of men,"eazy read, profound knowledge gained, food for thought! pass it on, be a part of the peace process. Lets hope men get the same out of the books about us."
3,Okay but not Great,I was given this book during our pre-marital counseling and didn't read it until after we were married. It had a lot of good information but it was very repetitive and hard to stay focused on.
5,THIS IS A REALLY GOOD BOOK,MOST INFORMATIVE. FIND THINGS U MIGHT THINK YOU KNOW AND IF YOU DONT DO A LOT OF RESEARCH ON RELATIONSHIPS THIS IS SOMETHING YOU PROBABLY WOULD NEVER NO OR UNDERSTAND IF YOU DONT READ THE BOOK
1,Religious Tone,"I did not think that this book added a great deal of real information that wasn't just common sense. Also, parts of it reminded me of a religious sermon. This seemed to be out of place and totally unexpected. The book was not what I expected. This book is great for the religious right, not the general public."
3,Hm :/,"I was unaware of how religious this book was going to be when I bought it. Nothing in the description mentioned it. Sure, the author writes Christian novels but I figured a mention or two would be ok. There is a mention of God or a psalm in every chapter. It even asks you to prey at one point.Content wise, it had great information and helped me with my relationship (and gender studies class). I would have preferred less religious content though."
4,well written,"Although most of us already know some of what we are about to read, there is still much to gain in this book. It's very well written, which says a lot, considering the poor quality of many books in this category. I found the balance very good. Unlike one of the reviewers, I found it fair to both men and women."
5,Amazing,I bought this book from the recommendation of my sister in law - who said it made a big difference in her life. I was a little skeptical but considering my husband and I had been fighting a lot recently I decided it was worth a shot.This is probably the best money I have spent on a book in a while.I read this sitting on a plane - and was totally engulfed. I finished it within a few hours. I was totally amazed by the differences in logic and perception. What a difference this made! After I made it home I implemented some of the suggestions - and I must say it worked IMMEDIATELY. I wish I had read this book sooner! Thank you so much to the author!
2,Colorful jacket on the book is great,"I read this book in like, 5 hours. Reads like a compilation of Cosmo articles. I really thought the insights into the male mind and emotional patterns would be more in depth. But it's all based on her surveys, which were a little bit elementary in my opinion. But the content is valuable.Pros about this book would be the tone that she writes in. It's all very positive, very Stand By Your Man, support him , understand him. He needs respect, He needs to be the provider, He needs sex and he needs you to stay in shape and look good for him.Better than the latest, greatest manuals on ""how to catch a man."" For two reasons, one, is that spirituality is an important third party in relationships, which she points to often. And, that the book is geared towards married women and women in relationships and upholds men as partners, full of tenderness and feeling, as opposed to gamers or predators."
3,Didn't solve all our problems.,"Got the book for the GF...It must have been boring because I don't think she read it all. I'll read anything, so I picked it up and read through it. I felt a lot of the stuff was spot on, but the authors might have been a little too pushy with their motives."
4,good book,Shaunti Feldhahn is a good author. This book helped me understand my husband better. I would recommend it to any woman who wants to become a better wife.
4,Interesting,"Some old information, but some great insights. This is a worthwhile read if you're interested in what men are really thinking and feeling."
5,Great read!,Very good information to know to see the other sides view of life and how they interact with the world and what we do.
1,disappointed,"I was extremely disappointed and caught very off guard by this book. I completed this book with a women's group and couldn't believe the point of view. I felt like the book expected and told women that they should be ""June Cleaver"". Very disappointed in the message that women should have no say so in anything and just fall to the feet of their man. Also, I did not understand how this book's message was in any way the message given in the bible as to what a wife should strive to be."
4,Enlightening insight to understanding men,"This book has surprised me in the many ways it has shown me that I simply had NO CLUE about how men think or feel. I thought I understood what went through men's minds, but reading this book made me pause, reflect, shed tears... for all the times that I unwittingly did/said something harsh and wrong to the guy that I loved. I'm still not married, but at least now I can see where I went wrong so many times. I'm grateful for this book. It opened my eyes so that I could better understand how to let my guy (the next one) know what's in my heart for him. Glad I purchased it. I will be recommending it to many of my friends."
2,Very statistical,I was kind of dissapointed with this material. It only talks about statistics... more like a thesis or something...Was hoping something more conductual-psychological oriented.
3,"A Book: What you need to know about the inner lives of men, Key remote: for 2001 Buick LaSabre",Where is the book I ordered a month ago or so. Also how do I cancel the Key Remote that I ordered for the 2001 Buick LaSabre?Thank youKim Meshew
1,It's a bunch of useless crap to the modern woman,"Unfortunately, this book is only going to help you if you're a fat nagging religious close minded wife who's let herself go.For the modern woman with common sense (and who doesn't have her man beg her for sex, for instance) this book is completely useless. I can think of a few women who'd benefit from it (church ladies?), but most of the things on this book are common sense to a well educated wordly woman. I also found Shaunti Feldhahn's way of writing very anoying...at the beggining of the book, it feels like she goes on and on about respect forever. I get it, respect the man, there's no need to say it 30 times with different words.It was definitly a waste of money."
5,great book with great insight,"I have not completed the book, but enjoy it very much so far. It has opened my eyes to different lives of men and their thoughts!"
5,For Women Only,Fabulous book! I was having communication problems with the man in my life and purchased this book hoping to find ideas to help open our communication. It opened my eyes to many things I never knew to a man's way of thinking and I am glad I bought it. I have referenced back to it many times to make sure I am understanding his way of thinking when our communication gets short-wired. I would definitely recommend this book to any woman having trouble communicating with her man.
2,"non-Christians, this is NOT the book for you!","While the book could be insightful at times, I agree with one of the other reviews in that it does not offer many solutions except prayer. As a non-Christian and a non-religious person, this solutions seems like a cop-out to me. I wanted a guide to not only better understand the amazing person I am with, but more importantly to get some guidance on how to deal with man vs. woman issues, which this book does not offer for non-Christains. So if you are like me, I suggest finding something that does not provide only faith based answers.Good luck and happy reading!"
2,No new information,"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men by Shaunti Feldhahn: This book gives many honest answers from different men in various surveys asking about respect, romance, sex, career and many other various topics. Although the author includes many surveys that show what men want, it doesn't go in detail on the age group, cultural backgrounds or religious backgrounds of these men. To say that most men think a certain way based on a general survey was not very persuasive to me. Even though the topics of the books were very interesting, each chapter was very short and the author failed to go deeper in depth into things that I wanted to learn more. Overall, I didn't find this book enjoyable. I didn't learn anything new about men that I don't already know. However, it served as a reminder of things that I should be aware more on a daily basis."
4,Very Eye Opening,"I was introduced to this book at a Weekend to Remember conference. It sounded very interesting so I figured that I would purchase this one for me and the For Men Only book for my husband. I'm still in the process of reading it but I have to say that from what I read already, I am starting to see how the things that I say can be misinterpreted by my husband. So this book has caused me to really think about what I say and how I react to that communication between my husband and myself can be better. I would recommend this book to every couple that really wants to make their communication better and in the end connect more as a couple and have the type of marriage that God intended us to achieve."
5,Very eye opening!,"My husband and I both feel we have an awesome marriage, and understand each other very well BUT this book was VERY eye opening for me. I would comment on various aspects of it and my husband totally agreed. I have since shared it with two friends, and they both loved it as well. We all read it in about two or three days...an easy read, but power-packed!"
3,Good Informational,Good Information nice reinforcement of things that we already know and things that we need to learn in relationships. using the things I have learned in my current relationship its helping.
3,Good if your young,It's good if your young and haven't heard these things before. I feel when reaching a certain age you do know that sex is important for men not only for mental bonding and that respect is important for them too. I can't say it gave me a lot to read it. Maybe to be less critical as a partner is what I got from it.
5,Best book ever for understanding men,"This is the best book I have ever read on understanding men. At times I wanted to throw it across the room, because I didn't like what it said, but I guess sometimes the truth hurts. It does have a very happy ending, though...and one that restored my faith in marriage and relationships between men and women.I especially appreciated that it includes data collected in a scientific, professional way and that it is based on information gleaned straight from the lips of men. Also, I found it valuable that the men interviewed were from all socio-economic, religious, cultural backgrounds and a variety of ages.A must read for every woman."
1,Horrible advice,This book advocates women being the paragon of Christian virtue in public and quite the opposite in private to appease their husbands. It also says that men cannot help but desire a beautiful/scantily clad woman that comes into his field of vision. A woman or anyone should be able to be themselves in public and private. And men and women both who are in a committed relationship should never think of another person with lust if they are in love.
1,How to Cater to your Husband and ignore your own needs.,"A well-meaning friend sent this to me. Perhaps I'm a bad wife, but i couldn't help but wonder where the compromise came in.If you were to take this book as gospel, you'd have long bitten off your tongue to stop saying anything your husband could consider derrogatory or disrespectful, you'd be starving yourself (but cooking gourmet dinners for him) lest he think you weren't 'taking care of yourself', and faking orgasms every night because ""men need sex; it's the physical equivalent of them talking to you"".So if you want a marraige like that, I'd definitely say 'follow this book to the letter.' If you want your marriage to be all about him, then read this book and follow the directions. Or, better yet, if you want to feel guilty because despite your best efforts, you dare speak your mind and say no to sex every now and again because you're -- gasp! -- tired, or worse, BUSY! Read this book.otherwise, don't bother. It'll just make you mad."
2,Redundant and boring,"The biggest issue I had with this book is the author says that men are secretly hiding insecurities and they always care about what somebody else thinks. If a man said this, I would be intrigued, because he knows what he is talking about because HE IS A MAN and he knows what's going on. Also, she's basing the whole book on survey results. She's coming to the conclusion that most men are like this or that because 70 percent of the men she polled said so. If you go on the website, you can see how the questions were answered. Honestly, I got more out of her survey results online than reading her book. I would have preferred to read a book about men from a MAN'S perspective"
5,Not only for married women,As a not-married woman this book has helped me tremendously!It helped me understand my boyfriend and men in general. It is by far one of the best books I have ever read and worth every cent and then some!I gave it to my girlfriends to read and it helped all of them in their relationships too.This book helps women in general to understand men. You understand your guyfriends better after reading it too.An amazing book that I highly recommend!
5,Insightful!,"What an insightful and extremely helpful book! I highly recommend this book to any woman interested in learning how to better understand the man in her life. The book was an easy read that only took a couple of hours and covered many topics such as how men are more successful when they feel respected, trusted, affirmed, and desired by the women in their lives. The book delved into the inner workings of their minds and showed how visual they really are and their thought process on many topics. Feldhahn used a widespread survey of diverse men as well as comments from men to gather the data for the book. This book has already helped me to better my relationship."
1,"If you have no respect for yourself as a woman, you'll love this book","This book was not only an insult to my intelligence, but also an assault on my education in psychology. This book is nothing but gender role enforcement. It truly breaks my heart to know that a single woman out there could think so little of herself that she would buy into this nonsense."
4,Good book,Wish it was a little bigger. Not as long either. But learned a lot from this book :). Would reccomend to others.
5,An eye opener for women,"This book is subtitled, ""what you need to now about the inner lives of men."" The author surveyed nearly a thousand men about what's important to them, what they think and why and allowed them to communicate on topics that they would not otherwise want to or be able to speak with women about in routine life. The answers to the surveys are fascinating and revealing and can really help a woman who cares about her man and her relationship (in marriage, in particular) deepen and strengthen it. In turn, he will be more readily able to respond and meet her needs. Any woman who is frustrated in her relationship with her man can benefit from reading this book. If you would like to get a taste of what's being offered, visit the author's web site at www.4-womenonly.com."
3,Quick and easy read,"Very, very, very basic book. Written to the lowest common denominator. I breezed through this in an afternoon. I don't think I read anything I didn't already know, but I've been blessed to have a very good male friend who will tell me the truth, even when my husband is reluctant. The biggest benefit was to be able to reasssure my good male friend that he is normal. It made me want to read the one written for men just to make sure I am normal - and I am. Oh, goody!"
5,"Not just for husbands, but fathers, brothers, etc.","This is a must-have book for any woman who wants to better understand the men in her life (and what woman doesn't??). Although its focus is on marriage, the ideas apply to not just husbands, but fathers, brothers, etc. (And I'm quite sure what I learned from this book came into play when I wrote Last Chance Rescue, which has a male lead character.) I didn't feel it was advocating a ""subservient"" role to the wife. And I'm pretty touchy about that kind of thing! - Tracey Cramer-Kelly, author, Last Chance Rescue"
1,"kind of the opposite of ""do unto others....""","Disingenous, facile and less than helpful. I find that my husband and I are both human beings and tend to have similar needs and wants, and if not, well, we have imaginations too. Oh, and mouths and human speech.Feldman suggests that men and women are vastly different from each other and have a different need for respect or love (age old ""men want respect, women want love""). The revelation that ""men will choose to be respected without being loved over being loved without being respected"" is blighted by the false dichotomy, ludicrous and offensive to people everywhere. I may not be a Harvard graduate but most people will agree with me when I say that if there's no respect, it's not love."
2,"Today's cultural view of men, not Christ's","American culture today pushes a view of men obsessed with sex, power and money. Sadly, in this book, we find men who are buying into this relaxed standards (or no standards) version. Christ offered up an alternative way to live. (Col. 3:5; Matt 5:25, 2 Pet. 2:14)For a more balanced view of Christian masculinity, I suggest:Answering the Guy Questions: The Set-Apart Girls Guide to Relating to the Opposite Sex"
1,Where's the meat?,"This book is a waste of money. It basically says the same thing (in kindergarten language) over and over and over again: men need respect. To bulk it out, they've taken a line from the text and repeated it in larger type on the same page, doing this on so many pages that it probably increased the page count by 10%. A total rip-off."
2,not what i expected,this book is not what i expected. it is intended for married people with christian undertones. just not for me.
1,the bible is what you need to have a wonderful marriage...,"To many people in this day and age are looking for all kinds of ""ways"" to make their marriage better. While self help books are on the rise the reading of ""The Word"" is on the decline. My marriage has turned around by reading the Scriptures and doing the Word not just using it to help me. Women, read Proverbs 31. This is a woman a man loves. Pray for your husand and lift him up to Jesus every day and build yourself up in your most holy faith."
2,There are better books on the topic,"This book is great for newlyweds that know little or nothing about each other or for couples that do not communicate. But we've been married over 11 years and we communicate great so nothing in this book was news to me. Not only I had read the same information ""about men"" in other books, I knew exactly how my husband would have answered her survey questions. We have read numerous books about being a couple and there are better books by Tim & Beverly LaHaye as well as Kevin Lehman.There's very little ""Christian"" guidance in this book. It's simply a presentation of the results of her survey of men with her own personal commentary."
4,Where and when will we get the rest of it????,"I like the dvd but was dissappointed that trying to get all 26 episodes was like Bush looking for WMD's in Iraq!!! [...] I went to the anchorbay entertainment site they no longer carry it, then I read at one of the transformer sites that rhino was putting out a box set which was suppose to be out ever since august 2004 so I went to their site of course they don't have it so I wrote an e-mail to ask what happened of course I'm still waiting on a reply (Fat chance!!!) Maybe they like to keep us in suspense or maybe through some miracle somebody will have all 26 episodes on amazon....guess I'll have to keep my fingers and toes crossed.......Your friendly neighborhood Chic..."
2,dissapointed,"why can't i find the complete series on amazon but i can on ebay? you would think that amazon would carry it or have info on it if it will come out in the future, but i can't even find info in any stores that could place an order"
3,Good book,"I did love this book. Very detailed on the characters and everything. Anyone who has a interest in Anne Bonny, Mary Read, and Jack Rackham, I recommend this book. It's a good fiction and some fact, but good all in all."
5,Classic and engaging,"If you like swashbuckling historical love books this is a good one to choose to read on a road trip or swinging from a hammock on the beach. The author takes you on a personal journey into the seperate lives of Anne and Mary then brings you all together for a fantastic voyage in the Caribbean complete with sword fights, politics and the ultimate punishment for pirating. The story was written so well that I was hardpressed to keep remembering this is based on real people and these events actually happended to them."
3,The brother who was painted out of his picture,"BRANWELL is an historical novel which tells the story of the Bronte family from the perspective of the black sheep brother, about whom most readers only know he was painted out of the family portrait. Like Jean Rhys' Wide Sargasso Sea (about the first Mrs. Rochester in Jane Eyre), Branwell enhances any reading of the sister's novels."
3,Too difficult for Grades 4 and 5,"These are challenging and interesting math word problems, well laid out and organized. As a Canadian, I hadn't thought about the math aspects like measurement and money that are in American measurements, not metric. For the Grade 4s and 5s I work with as a teacher, these questions are only for the brightest. They would be good for a gifted or challenge math program."
3,"Interesting, but not challenging for the grade levels 4-8","It is an interesting book, and fun to work on for maybe lower grades. It does cover a lot of areas in math up to 4th grade in my opinion. At the end of the book, it had the problems that you can use to introduce the idea of variables.Maybe okay for an advanced 2nd or 3rd grader, okay for an average 4th grader-6 grader."
5,5 Minute Math Problem of the Day,"Teachers love this nice ""sponge"" activity which requires application of several skills or processes at once. No more having to think up a good math activity! Students enjoy working together to discover answers."
2,Underwhelmed,"I bought this book to keep my son, who just finished fourth grade, interested in math and to allow him to maintain progress starting from what he had learned over the previous year. The book promised fun problems that would not take long to complete.The problems in the book were essentially the same type of exercises as my son had been assigned in school over the prior two years, by which he had been bored. They were neither particularly interesting nor conceptually challenging. My son read a few and had no interest in doing them. I looked through the book to find two somewhat conceptually interesting exercises (which I still did not find all that interesting) and told my son he should do those. He did them within 30 seconds. That the was the last time he looked at the book.In short the book did not help maintain my son's interest in math over the summer."
5,cold weather essentials,"This book focuses on the special needs of camping in cold weather. It has up to date and accurate information.Includes life saving information on staying warm and hypothermia, packing, and clothing selection. Also information you need to know about special steps to take with food, water, sanitation, first aid, sleep systems, shelter, emergencies, and training for cold-weather camping. And to save you money it has info on how to make your own equipment. Very good little book. Published by the Boy Scouts of America so this information is put to the test every winter."
4,Great marriage book. Could have focused more on the second.,"The subject line sums it up. A great marriage book for anyone to read that's about to get married. I just thought more focus could have been put on the dynamics of a second marriage. The blended family chapter was good for this, but more focus could have been put on the relationship and its dynamics."
5,It is help us in saving our marriage,"This is a great book that I am reading with my wife. Both of us are in a second marriage and did not want to make the same mistakes again. This book provides some great ""hard"" questions that should be answered truthfully for the greatest success in the second marriage."
1,Didn't work.,"Despite the best effort of the concerned parties,a parting of the ways occurred.Now the book is a doorstop. The end."
5,"Insightful, practical advice","My soon-to-be husband and I used this series as our premarital counselling guide and found it to be well-designed, practical (without being so full of pseudo-psychiatry that it felt fake.) The suggestions of topics that should be considered prompted some of the deepest discussions we had. We are both convinced that finding this resource was a blessing."
3,A lot of religious content,"I wasn't expecting the strong religious orientation of the book. The content seems to become increasingly religious as the book goes on, quoting scriptures and drawing examples from the Bible, etc., and it concludes by saying that no relationship can flourish without Jesus. There was some useful content, especially in the earlier chapters, but for those who are looking for secular relationship books, it's worth noting that this isn't one."
3,Generally a really good Perl book but ...,"EDITORS WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!!! I think that the editors of this book should find another job - this book is full of typos and errors.Other than that this would be a great book (probably five stars if it had a better index).Anyway the material, the pace, and the writing style are all to my liking. Probably not great if you haven't already had some programming experience.I hope the next edition fixes the pile o' errors."
3,Revised opinion!,"Review no. 25 has it wrong about the recursive function; the program on Page 151 is NOT an infinite loop. I committed an error in trying out that recursive function. Given the number of errors in the book, it was easy to assume that it was a typographical error! I have read more of the book now and the density of errors actually decreases in the latter half of the book. I am therefore increasing the number of stars to three (from two)."
3,Good Reference Book But Error Prone Examples,"I am currently using ""Perl 5 Complete"" as a first exposure to Perl. The problem I have with recommending the book is that many examples that I work with do not run because of typos. What makes matters worse is that there does not seem to be any way of obtaining an errata sheet! I have contacted both the authors and the publishing company to no avail. Who takes responsibility?"
2,I found poor topic discussions and a terrible index.,I purchased the book as a reference guide on how to's. There were some good examples on email and ole. But the overall discussions were terrible. And the index was lame. I don't recommend buying the book.
3,"again, good",another good sequel which explains a little more about freddy. similar in quality to pt. 4
2,The most comically grusome Freddy sequel made,"Freddy is back to kill teens again. But this time he uses the dreams of an unborn baby. Freddy has definately become more comedy then horror, but that still doesn't let it down too much. A couple of grusome deaths and fight-to-the-death scenes save it from being as bad as part 4. A bit more technical than most of the sequels."
3,If only...,"If only there were like 4 more killings in this one, the movie would flow along better. It's still entertaining...There's only 2 letdowns:1) Too little deaths..3 I think 2) The plot overpowers the suspense"
2,this one's gotta be the worst of them all,"this one is just too gorey,it's stupid.the worst acting that i have ever seen.the only thing good was that it was a little funny cause freddy always makes some funny jokes."
2,Great,This is not the greatest Elm Street movie lets face it. Really its the worst out of the series. I don;t really get what the baby has to do with Freddy he wants Alice not her kid. But if your a die hard fan see this movie.
2,The most comical Freddy sequel,"Freddy brings Amamda Krueger back to life so he can be reborn. The he starts killing teens by using the dreams of an unborn baby to kill teens. Quite a chessy plot and a couple of grusome deaths actaully make this sequel worth watching. Still not that good, but enjoyable enough."
2,"Nine, ten, the same old thing again.","Special effects are once again the main attraction of this film. And it's true that there are some great Freddy Krueger sequences and imaginative setes (although the final showdown has echoes of Labarynth with its anti-gravity staircases). But really this is no more than 'another Freddy film'. Its dark and sinister atmosphere mean it's better than the dreadful Part 4, and the idea of an unborn baby's dreams being invaded is a novel twist, but things are generally rather aimless. The heroine doesn't stand out from the thousands of others in films of this type. She certainly lost a lot of my sympathy when she started stamping on those tarantulas. I'd like to think that no real spiders were harmed during the making of this film. To sum up, if you're a special effects fan then go and see this. Just don't expect any multi-layered, complex storyline."
1,Nightmare on Elm Street Five,My gosh! I rent a movie that is UNCENSORD and rated NC-17 and I expect MORE! This movie was a tottal let down and a waste of my money! I expected so much more! So all you people willing to waste a little more than a dozen greens on this cruddy movie DONT!
1,poor,A Nightmare on Elm Street 5 reeks of a bad script. Don't even bother with this film. I feel that Part 4 and 5 really should not have been added to the series but Part 5 is the worst of the two and without question the worst of the sequels.
2,Now this is pathetic,"I like that It comes right off of 4, but where the hell did those three nobodies in this movie come from? and didnt make much sense but it's O.K."
3,Not that Bad,"I know I reviewed this already, that said it kinda boring, but I saw it again, I was wrong I said that because I didnt see it in a while, I saw it again, I was wrong, it wasnt that bad has I thought it was."
3,THE BEST IN THE SERIES,"Alright all the series are stupid, I didn't like sequels like part 1,2,3,6. those were the worst and weakest entries.but parts 4,this one part 5,and NEW NIGHTMARE. are the best in the series.this one starts with Alice trying to save her newborn baby from Freddy Krueger he will possess the toddler to be like him,so Alice gets help from her friends and even a nun to keep Freddy from the toddler.the special effects are awesome and so is the script, quite enjoyable killing scenes with gore and gruesomeness to keep watchable."
2,The worst of the them all,"This is the worset of them all. There is ver little fight back and action. The victins deaths are corney and stupid. There are some cheezy lines like don;t sleep and drive. The part that makes fun of superman at the end was very cheesy.The only thing that keeps this movie from being a one is Freddy;s whitty lines, the return of Alice from the fourth one. The return of Amada Kruker freedys mother Last seen in Nigmare on Elm Street three Dream Warriors. My Recomendations see 1-4 four and Freddys dead and Freedy versus Jason. Do not see Nightmare five unlesh your bord senlesss.I just hope Freedy dead and new nightmare are better. I am plannig on by 4 and Freddy Versus Jason."
1,And they continued the series because why?,"Nightmare on Elm Street, A: The Dream Child (1989) Robert England, Lisa Wilcox, Erika Anderson, Valorie Armstrong, Michael Ashton, Kelly Jo Minter, Whitby Hertford, Danny Hassel, Beatrice Boepple, D: Stephen Hopkins.In the fifth installment, the nightmarish dream-stalker Freddy enters the dreams of survivor Wilcox's unborn child, attempting to place the souls of those he killed into the fetus, and enjoys his favorite pastime by going after her friends. Again, bizarre effects are the only pro here, but the movie's a bust. They saved the worst for last, but it's followed by FREDDY'S DEAD: THE FINAL NIGHTMARE.Running Time: 89 minutes and rated R for language and gore/violence."
1,"oh, my god! how corny!","i only watched this movie to say that i had seen all the sequels, and now i wish that i hadn't. the only good actors were the African-american friend of alice and the man who played freddi."
1,Get outta here....,The personnel responsible for making this wretch of a film should be ashamed. Way to sell out.
2,Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child,"The second to worst film in the series. Not that good. Kind of boring with hardly any death scenes or comedy. Starring: Robert Englund, Lisa Wilcox, Danny Hassel, Erika Anderson and Kelly Jo Minter."
2,"Boring, but good special effects.","Directed on autopilot, this is one of the more boring entries in the Nightmare on Elm Street series. Freddy is invading the dreams of the unborn child of Lisa Wilcox. It maybe sounds interesting but it isn't. That's cause the thin script has enough in it to make a shortfilm but not a feature. There is no story, just a lot of special effects. But the special effects are good so I give this 2 stars."
2,The new Vhs and Dvd version is terrible,"This version of Nightmare on Elm Street is so terrible.Where's the special features at either on this new Vhs or Dvd there's no deleted scenes like the uncut vhs version.Dan's motorcycle scene was more graphic his face was ripped off and a needle stabs his abck,and Greta's death was longer Freddy cuts her stomach and feeds her own livers.There should be a new Vhs or Dvd version of the uncut version."
2,ABSOLUTELY THE WORST SEQUEL IN THE SERIES.,"This movie should never have been made and part 6 should of been part 5.The movie had some great effects and moments,but the story made no sense and the acting was poor.I have said my peace."
1,It made absolutely no sense,"This is tied with ""Freddy's Revenge"" as the worst sequel. Nothing made sense, it followed ""The Dream Master"" in that Alice appeared in this, she and Dan were together and she becomes pregnant shortly before high school graduation, but doesn't find out until Dan is killed in an accident, but that's about it.There aren't enough words to describe how awful this was. The story behind Freddy was explained but it didn't matter anyway because he was brought back.This isn't Freddy at his best."
3,Too weird,"This was really weird. I mean, it was interesting because it kept my attention, but I just was weirded out by the whole baby having dreams and the child in the dream, it was just so weird. It ranks in the bottom 3 of the Nightmare on Elm Streets for me."
2,Not as Good as the Fourth one,"A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child follows one of the best in the franchise-The Dream Master, yet this one seems to just lose the credibility the third and fourth ones attempted to make. The idea is kind of hocky, Freddy being to weak to attack Alice, so he attacks her unborn child. The return o Freddy's mother is kind of lame as well. The good acting is gone and the scare factor is non-existant. The one good thing though is the gore factor. There are some good ""original"" death scenes which kind of make the movie worth watching."
1,Nightmare takes a turn for the worst,"Nightmare on Elm Street 5 in my opinion is by far the worst in the series. In this installment Alice (from Nightmare 4) is back and is now pregnant. But now Freddy is now trying to come resseurect himself through her child.Now that you know the basic plot let's get to why this movie is so horrible. First and foremost the acting is terrible, now normally this wouldn't bother me too much but even Robert Englund fails to entertain. Freddy isn't even clever anymore. That and the killings are worse than usual too. Most of them just became too over the top and stupid. Stay away from the installment at any cost."
1,"Don't waste your time, or money","This 5TH time around, (Yes fifth), Freddy is at the same thing he's been at for the last 4 films. To NOES fans: you'll probably still want to see it, but NOT MORE THAN ONCE. Don't even think about buying this DVD. I definitely do not recommend this 5th sequel to anyone, it's a total bore!"
2,"Nightmare on Elm St., part 5..","part 5. Freddy attempts to create an evil baby out of the souls of his victims. Lisa Wilcox does a good job in her role, as does of course Robert Englund. But the kill scenes seem a little contrived and implausible and too tongue-in-cheek comedic.The ""evil baby"" idea seems far-fetched, and doesn't provide any chills. I couldn't really find Freddy's motivation for wanting to do this.* pass on this *"
3,"""Told ya comicbooks was bad for ya!""","Yep,and that's what i was thinking while watching this movie. Just a big comicbook. And i'm not talking about Batman or the Punisher, no i'm talking about Archie and Jughead. Freddy's way too much of a comedian in this movie! I like a little humor now and then but jeez! When people think Freddy they're supposed to hide under their bedsheets not burst out in hysterical laughter and tell you how good of pals they are with him. That's the films major downfall. It's not in any way terrifying! But we have to commend Robert Englund for yet another stellar performance as our favorite fear-loving anti-hero. Hey, atleast it was better than Halloween and Friday the 13th part 5!"
2,"MORE OF THE SAME, BUT NOT AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL! 2 1/2 STARS!","I am reviewing the entire Nightmare on Elm Street series, but not this DVD release. I own the box set and I wanted to do individual reviews for each film.This entry is just more of the same, but it has some fun moments and Freddy is a big a ""wiseguy"" as ever. The series has drifted away from the class of the original, but as part of a Halloween marathon, this one's not too bad. The DVD transfer looks good on this edition."
3,Gets Worse.,The series by the the time this movie was tiring and they had to release as many as they could. I think the Alice character was the weakest part of the movie and they kept her alive. they should have just scrapped this movie although Alice's boyfriend was cute. This was probably the third worst in the series. I do not recommend it.
3,a intresting fun movie,we all know that during the 80s they made a whole bunch of slasher flicks. this is part five so when i was at the video store i wasnt sure if i should get this i got it and it turned out to be fun freddy is not as funny as part three and part four he really is creepy. i liked part three better but still a fun movie.
4,I loved it!,"I fist borrowed this CD from a public library last summer, and fell in love with it. It has a great collection of songs and I would sugest it to anyone. I didn't like the last couple of songs as much as the beginning, especially Aqua and Spice Girls, but that is my personal preference! The price is only a couple of dollars more, and what would those dollars be doing sitting on your counter anyway? :) Just buy it, you wont regret it."
4,Very Good Alternate Timleine Epic,"This is the sequel to Procurator and New Barbarians, where Germanicus Julius Agricola eventually wound up becoming emperor in a Rome that never fell. In this book, his Republican dream-a Rome without an Emperor, governed by the Senate-are discovered and a conspiracy forms that puts him on the run, and later plunges Rome into civil war. Don't be hoping for a conclusive ending though-this book ends on a cliffhanger."
5,!!!!!!!,"This is the tale of the humbling of Gawain, a legendary knight of the Round Table. It is told through the eyes of Gawain's squire, Terence. Gawain and Terence set out in search of the Green Knight. Along the way, they go on all sorts of adventures including a trip to the Otherworld. They rescue a pretty maiden named Eileen and fight evil boars! Gerald Morris is a superb writer making the book by turns funny and touching. I recommend this to everyone."
3,COPY CAT!!!!!,"Sure, it's a good book but please, the whole plot is borrowed. The names, plot, personaliy, everything seems the same as Lloyd Alexander's books. I mean Taran and Terence, Eilonwy and Eileen. Eileen is sooooo much like Lloyd Alexander's Eilonwy. I love the parts at the castle with King Arther ect. but the rest of the story......Maybe I'm just being picky but I really think that if Gerald Morris can't come up with his own names then he shouldn't be writing.To anyone out there who likes Lloyd Alexander then don't read this book. It makes you feel cheated. If you haven't read his books then maybe you will like this book. I don't know."
5,Great product,The information in this publication is highly technical and complex. This has kept me engaged and challenged. Dr. Missler presents his research and a summary of others that gives one a new appreciation for the Bible.
4,Good,This was a good introduction into how we got our bible and even if one doesn't agree with what chuck says on the subject still a good start. Somethings must be taken in light of Acts 17:11 some more then others but remeber other scholars have different opinions and some agree with what most of chuck says on this issue. Great intro.....
5,Great Preparation!,The practice exams go hand-in-hand with the Core Four Study Guides and are similar to the real thing(s). A MUST for all those seeking MCSE Certification!
3,"Tough going, but does make a good point.","The book seems quite archaic in viewpoint now, and could be updated for modern readers. Still Ueland makes a great point, that you need to wrtie with soul and passion from your heart, not strive for some lofty, arty goal. She points out what is wrong with much of popular culture today, it seems more an imitation of greatness than greatness. In a sense, you can't fake soul and heart. If it doesn't come from you, the reader will know. Still, the book takes forever to make its points and Ueland's constant ""I'll try and tell you about it later"" proclamations throughout the book make you wonder if this wasn't a first draft. Like most writing books, this one is a wee bit overrated. Wanna write, do it."
2,A Nice Old Lady,"Undoubtedly Mrs. Ueland was a nice woman but this book is self-indulgent fluff. All she says in the entire book is, ""If you want to write, write; everything you write will be worthy simply because you are a unique human being."" If that inspires you, read the book (even though you now know every thought contained therein)."
2,yuck,"I liked the ideas in the book but I found the voice so condescending I was unable to finish it. First off the author writes as if what works for her works for everyone. WHen I encountered teh following sentance I just lost interest ""They say a mexican will sit on his hauches for hours smoking a cigarette and happily looking at nothing for hours"""
1,disappointed,"First, this book is a reissue of one written decades ago. Eleanor Roosevelt and Herbert Hoover figure in it, with others whose lifestyles disappeared around the time I was born seventy years ago. Second, the text is padded with largely irrelevant material quoted from luminaries and her students' writing assignments. Third, I forced myself to finish reading this book only to realize I had gained nothing from my efforts--no inspiration, no practical advice, not even a moment of enjoyment. Save your money!"
2,Okay for its time,"I downloaded the sample for this book, and then decided to read the whole thing. I wish I'd stopped with the sample. It boils down to, If you want to write, do it or you'll kill the creative spirit within you.I got a lot more practical advice from The War of Art by Steven Pressfield."
3,Quite boring,"I actually found ""If You Want to Write"" to be quite boring. I felt that the book was more about developing self esteem and learning that you are good enough to write. If you already are confident that you can write, but simply haven't opened the doors to your creativity, you may want to search for other reading material."
2,I guess I am missing the inspiration,"It appears I have missed the boat on this book. I struggled with to find all the wisdom everyone was clamoring about. After a week I was still only on page 28. Sorry, but the book obviously did not ""speak"" to me. I am glad others found some gems."
1,Don't Buy This Defective Book!,"Don't buy this book. It is missing the front pages. There is no title page, legal details page, table of contents, preface, etc. It starts abruptly on page 3. I told Amazon this in my replacement request. They sent me an equally defective book. Save your money and time."
2,Underwhelming,"I bought this book because I read some reviews online about the book. I found the book underwhelming. She doesn't share anything that I haven't known or read, or heard. It's repetitive. I kept on waiting for the punchline, or the 'aha', but never got to that."
5,"Not just about writing, but the creative process for anyone","This book is outstanding. It stands the test of time because what it talks about are basic and intrinsic truths about writing and creating. Rather than proscribe exercises to work-out your writing muscles or other superficial tricks, Ueland tells you the basics of the CREATIVE PROCESS, which holds true for any kind of art. While these things are fundamental, they are not common knowledge. Many thanks to her for pointing out the building blocks in such a supportive and encouraging (and comical) way. You will want to write volumes after having read this."
2,Boring!!!!!!!!!,This book is considerably boring!! It provided me information that I already know. I definitely recommend this book to amateurs only!!
5,"Hands down, the best book on writing ever written","Hands down, the best book on writing ever written, in English, that is. Period. If you are alive and want to live, this is a must read (and a pretty well-kept secret alas)."
4,"If you want to Write, but feel stuck or not good enough-- read this!","I was able to get this book for free (lent to me) but I would have gladly paid list price and them some for this book. Although it felt sometimes like i was reading a ""classic"" due to the social references and phrasing, the words Brenda Ueland shares are time and again are inspirational, often poetic while still being succinct and concise.I will admit that I did a little skimming here and there, but I do that with a lot of books. This book isn't broken down into tiny little how-to write bites; think of it more as a unit-- confidence building pep-talks, inner-editor silencing realizations, and multiple of before & after samples of writing from people who heeded her advice and wrote true to themselves.Even though I read it for free, I'll probably buy it as a pseudo-reference book to keep on my ipad for those (often) times when I need a bit of inspiration or a creative kick in the can."
4,Inspirational! ...and then lags a little,"If You Want To Write by Brenda Ueland begins with some of the most honest and inspirational passages I've ever read - every word comes straight from the heart and speaking directly to you. I was having a kind of religious experience and looking forward to more. And then, once the author begins reviewing long passages by her students, the book loses momentum. The tone and writing are still true to form, but it just somehow feels overlong after awhile.The overarching theme of unleashing your creative spirit does come around by the end even though it lacks the magic from the beginning. I recommended this reading for any artist who has ever doubted her own ability."
4,"Better titled, ""if you want to do well at something creative""","I'd highly recommend this book to any people working in a creative field, particularly those who feel overwhelemed by the difference between the quality of work that they're producing and the quality of what the professionals do. Within the frame of the writing profession, the author talks about the need for passion, practice, and diligence to build competence and then expertise. She also covers how to have a good life along the way. While those coming to this book looking for Strunk & White, volume 2, will be disappointed, those looking for a quick boost of inspiration will be well served."
2,"Maybe for others, not for me.","This book is very conversational in style with ""footnote"" references on nearly every page that explain or defend Ueland's ideas or judgment. I almost felt as if I were reading a book written by a teen. Apparently there are many would be artists of every sort, writers in particular, who have no confidence to even begin their art. After the first chapter, I began reading the book faster and faster because I got tired of reading the refrain ""You are unique, you need confidence"" etc. Her editor didn't catch an important missing word and the passages included for demonstration are in the same font as Ueland's, so often it is cloudy whether the paragraph is a continuation of the quote or Ueland's words. I am happy for those who were inspired by Ueland's suggestions. The ideas were valid, just overstated."
3,Just okay...,"There are a lot of books out there on writing, like Stephen King's ""On Writing,"" and they all have their own niche.This one reminded me a lot of The Artist's Way by Julia Cameron, except Cameron's book resonates more with me personally. I understood what Ueland was saying, but it didn't reach me the way Cameron's book did.It's an older book and it felt outdated to me. Would recommend Cameron's or King's before this one."
5,A SERIOUS IN DEPTH ANALYSIS OF THE BEATLES' LYRICS,"One almost wants to smile and say, ""The Doctor [Turner] is in and he is analyzing the Beatles even as we speak."" I thoroughly enjoyed this well researched, richly illustrated book of Beatles' song lyrics. I felt that Turner did an outstanding job of gathering this information and providing it to the hordes of people eager to obtain it. It is truly a treat. I can't recommend this book highly enough. Turner treats the Beatles individually and their work with the utmost respect. This book is a must have."
3,This is sort of annoying,"This book doesn't really tell the story behind each song. It just explains the ""plotline"" or what the song is about, which obviously, can be discovered by simply listening to the song. There are many song entries that don't explain who or what inspired the Beatles to write the song, or why the song was so long, or why it was so short, or many other questions one might ask after hearing a Beatles song. Like on ""You're Going to Lose That Girl,"" he doesn't tell us if John Lennon wrote that song to be directed to a certain person, (if the ""you"" was really a real person), or if the ""you"" was supposed to represent himself, or anything like that. He simply says that it's a song warning another guy to stop flirting with the singer's girlfriend, basically. He doesn't explain the ""story behind the song,"" for many of them. So, it gets annoying."
4,Not Just For Beatles Fanatics,"A great, fun, well written book.You do not have to be a crazed Beatles fan to enjoy this one.I purchased this for a loved one who grew up listening to the Beatles, and we spent hours sitting on the couch, reminiscing about Beatles songs and reading aloud the stories behind them.The stories were so fun, that I ended up buying another copy and giving it to another friend (who also spent hours happily reading the tales).I would recommend tracking down your old records (or new CDs), curling up on your couch and listen to the music while you read this book. It's a great way to spend an afternoon."
2,Flawed,"The most obvious mistake which any Beatles fan will discover is the colored picture of The Beatles riding on a sleigh, stating it was from the film A Hard Day's night. Wrong! It was from help. Hello Mr. Turner.Second, so far, in Paperback Writer, it mentions that the studio engineer responsible for the great bass sound was Ken Townsend. It Was Geoff Emmerick that was now the engineer from Revolver on. Read "" Here, There & Everywhere - My Life Recording The Beatles"", by Geoff Emmerick."
4,good read about write,"There are many good photographs and tasty tidbits in this fascinating glance at the writing inspirations behind our favorite songs. A little of it must necessarily be speculation, but it is thoroughly researched. One question: where did he get the drawing that inspired ""Lucy In The Sky..,"" and is it authentic? He doesn't give a source."
1,disappointed,This book read like another attempt to re-write history by Paul McCartney.Too much innuendo and wanting of more historical fact.
4,Good book about an overrated band,"Please, I am getting so sick of the Beatles.It is 2005, enough is enough. Let's but the Beatles to bed already."
5,3 Items delivered in single package,"The item was delivered in a single package with other books purchased from Amazon.com and arrived very soon after purchased. All books were in very good condition. I would use Amazon.com again in the future, and would definitely recommend their service."
4,C programmer power-ups,"I consider myself to be a fluent C programmer. This book introduced many things to me that can make my Linux programs more powerful. From beginning topics such as Makefiles and Environments to more advanced topics such as Pipes, Forks, Shared Memory, Dynamic Libraries and Signal handling, I really got a lot out of this book."
4,Gotta Know C,Get a good C book and read it first. I would call this for the intermediate level Linux user.
4,Okay item...,Overall fine kit for less than $60. I'm glad the listing has been updated to indicate you may receive black OR silver lenses - not necessarily the lenses pictured. The filter kit is fine - they come in a little black case. Lens adapter is cheaply made - cleaning kit is as well. The mini tripod is fine. Stands just a few inches tall. Overall fine. Wish I would have spent a bit more to get quality products. Seller very polite.
2,the effect not so clear,"This is not the first time that I buy shiseido's product. I like the suncream. so I begin to trust the white lucent brightening moisturizing. I used the whole bottle already, but I am no going to buy more."
5,Just What We Had Been Looking For,"The ""Chinatown"" DVD was an item that we had shopped for and found through Amazon. DeeVeeDees offered this brand-new product at a very low price. The item was carefully packaged and shipped as well. We certainly recommend this seller!"
1,Chinatown used dvd,I realize that it was used and very inexpensive but the dvd gets stock towards the end of the movie and the scene selection part does not work. I did not send it back because I only paid something like $ 15.00 .
5,Classic film.,"This Roman Polanski film is a classic of American film. It has held up very well, and is both gripping and visually outstanding. If you are too young to remember Jack Nicholson when he was young and sexy, not the fat guy in shades at the Lakers' games, you have toi see Chintown."
3,"Pay attention, get rewarded",Although it moved a bit slow at times it's complexity made it interesting in the end. The title is a bit deceiving.
5,"""How to Stop a 'Nosebleed'""","Deeply atmospheric and mysterious. Jack Nicholson is great as a ""nosy"" private detective. He is really not prepared for the information Faye Dunaway's character lays on him. It is unthinkable, horiffic and chilling--a conclusion not many would easily jump to. Beautifully directed by Mr. Polanski who has a very bit part in the movie."
4,Cool Drama that is Not as it Seems,"In the Raymond Chandler tradition, Jack Nicholson portrays an excellent spin-off character of that era.While investigating misaligned marriages, the private eye stumbles onto murder and mass corruption at the Los Angeles' water and power company. John Huston plays the top dog; as family head and the influence under the silent partnerships that motivate murder. Faye Dunaway provides the romantic lure angle.Good entertainment value for this genre."
1,What's all the fuss about?,"I don't get why Chinatown is such a well respected movie. It is slooooow. Jack Nicholson plays Jack Nicholson. Every scene is long and drawn out often with no dialogue to keep it interesting. Half an hour could have been shaved off this with no real loss. I mean do we really have to watch him climbing over a chainlink fence for 5 minutes. No! But the biggest beef I have is with the direction. The filming of the ending scene which everyone always says is so great is all jumbly and amateur looking.I never really got to form an attachment to any of the main characters, they seemed more like modern actors self-consciously trying to embody certain film noir types.If you really want film noir go to the true source-- forties and fifties films like Panic in the Streets, the Asphalt Jungle, An Ace in the Hole or Laura.The only true heir to the film noir mantle in modern cinema is ""The Usual Suspects."" (Damn I wish Bryan Singer would make another movie like that one, but I digress)"
1,I Didn't Get It,"After hearing about how great this movie was, I finally purchased it for my wife. This has got to be the most over-rated movie of all times. A totally perdictable story-line, and a complete waste of the talents of Faye Dunaway. And to add insult to injury, the ending was horribly depressing. What can I say about Jack! Well, he was just the same old Jack as always. I'm not that hard to please, but I hated this movie."
5,Secrecy and Water - It's Chinatown,"I just saw Chinatown for the first time, since I was told that anybody taking a screenwriting class *must* see it. The story is full of tons of little things worth looking at and thinking about. Many minor characters, strange clues, deceits, and double-crosses to be found here. If you ever want to see Jack Nicholson in a good protagonist role, check this movie out. There's really only one scene in the movie where he gets frighteningly violent, and even that's only when he's desperate for some answers. The DVD is reasonbly priced for what you get. You get a great movie made in the classic style of the 1930s, as well as an in-depth documentary which includes interviews with Roman Polanski (director), Robert Towne (writer), and Robert Evans (producer). Screenwriting students, see this movie, or at least read the screenplay! Everybody else, if you like crime movies with interesting surprises, check Chinatown out! Enjoy."
2,Case for dvd came in pieces,"I got the dvd reasonably quick, but the case came in pieces. The seller just sent the dvd in an envelope with no protective bubble wrap or anything. I'm glad it was just the case and not the dvd. Its very disheartening when you pick up a package you have been looking forward to and hear pieces rattling around."
4,"Depressing, but good",I pretty much overall enjoyed the movie Chinatown. I thought the plot was pretty well. I especially enjoyed the character and how he never stopped trying to find out what was going on. Even when his nose got cut he would still keep on going. Though I enjoyed the movie I thought it was really depressing because in the end you find out that Mulholland raped his daughter and she had a child. And that is who mullholland was supposedly cheating with. It was actually his daughters daughter as well as his daughter.-eoin
1,Review for Amazon! why mix the reviews ?????,"hi see this 2009 edition for chinatown, I see the reviews and are reviews from other editions... so bad!!! I want see separate reviews for every product!!! please DONT MIX THE REVIEWS!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Boring and too long,"Cut out the dead spots and condense it down to 45 minutes. As it is, it drags on and on. Jack tries to be Bogart, but Jack is no Bogart. It IS a dull and boring movie. Save your money and buy the Pianist if you want a Polanski movie."
1,Don't Buy It- the Blu Ray,"Great movie, lousy depiction. Too many deep reds, too much color infused in the film , far from the original....The interior scenes are too dark. This is frankly a travesty. Don't buy it. The same goes for the most recent non Blu Ray DVD release, same problems....Shameful...."
2,Should be in scope,"Chinatown is one of the absolute best films of the 1970s, a neo-noir that is as dark and thrilling as they get. But according to the description, this edition is being released in the aspect ratio of 1.85:1. It was released in Panavision, which has a ratio of 2.40:1. This means that the sides of the image will be cropped out of the picture on both sides, reducing the image by about 25%. Sort of an anti-restoration.I wouldn't recommend buying this edition until the aspect ratio is restored to its original size."
2,Truly Over Rated,"I'm in the process of watching all of the movies on AFI's Top 100 list. This is one I hadn't seen yet and so far it is my least favorite. I just don't get it at all. Why this is on the list is beyond me. The movie was choppy, the acting was hokey, and the plot was weak."
2,I really tried,"But... sorry. After 3 seperate viewings, I tried to find some redeeming qualities about this movie.. but alas, none I could find.For film noir, I think D.O.A., either original or remake, does a much better job of showing desperate people doing desperate things. This movie plods along with a very contrived plot and almost completely flat acting by two greats... Faye Dunaway and Jack Nicholson. I think that may be deliberate, but doesn't do much here.Sorry for those who rave about it, but I really tried."
2,Okay.,"A mostly entertaining movie, but nothing to get too excited about. Other films do it far better, without the colossal pretensions that this one has. The idea is to subvert all of the classic noir conventions. Fine. Unfortunately, having subverted them, the filmmakers have nowhere to go, except right where any ordinary noir film would go. So it up-ends everything, but to no real purpose. Nice costumes, nice cinematography. Mood mood mood oozing out of every frame. For a real slice of classic Hollywood Noir, get The Maltese Falcon, or Murder My Sweet."
3,"The greatest film in the world since ""Billy Jack""!","Yes, I'm a Pepper too! That's why I'm so impressed with this movie. All the critics raved about it, especially Rex Reed, so it must be brilliant. Don't bother me with questions about why all that water was being dumped into the ocean; or how a thirty-eight snubby could even reach let alone hit someone at fifty yards. I'm an *intellectual* and have no patience with such pedestrian quibbles. Faye Dunaway is one of the greatest overactresses of all time; and Jack Nicholson is superlatively redundant as the noirish, hard-boiled, sharp-edged, gimlet-eyed gumshoe Jake Gittes. Of course, no discussion of this stupendous movie would be complete without genuflecting before His Worship, The Roman Polanski, who, in a career move worthy of awe, managed to stay on topic even in his private life. The challenge in being an *intellectual* is to see what isn't there. In Chinatown there is a great deal of it."
4,A First Rate Film Noir Classic,"Chinatown is a classic in the original sense. It's brooding and often dark plot offer's a real treat for any fan of film noir. Save only that it is in color instead of black and white. But this fact does not detract from this being a great film. This is, perhaps, one of Jack Nicholson's greatest film roles."
5,Re: Special Collector's Edition 2007,"When trying to decide what release of Chinatown to buy, I was looking for reviews regarding the video quality of a particular release because some DVDs look like they were copied from VHS tapes. Instead of finding the information I needed, I got ""noir""ed to death. In spite of the useless reviews, I am happy to report that the ""Special Collector's edition - 2007"" version of Chinatown has descent video quality compared to other standard-definition DVDs."
5,Polanski's film-noir masterpiece!,"""Chinatown"" is one of the best movies of all time directed by one of the greatest directors of all time (who seems to go unappreciated): Roman Polanski. With great performances by Faye Dunaway and Jack Nicholson, it's no wonder why this film is a classic. The film is a great example of film noir, and it keeps you in suspense throughout the film. The story for this film is so brilliant that it could beat out almost any modern Hollywood film today. Jack Nicholson plays a detective on a murder case in Chinatown, but only to get caught up in a world full of deceit and corruption.This film has so many great epic scenes, such as the one where Jack slaps Faye for some answers. The ending is one of the best endings of all time."
2,Chinatown DVD,I was pleased to find this and the pricing was good. It arrived in a timely matter. I was not that thrilled with the package of the DVD it's self. Almost looked like it had been hand done. The plastic covering the case was not very tight and corners and along the side were torn. A bit disappointed because it is a gift!!!
2,Overated. Overated. Overated.,"While Nicholson and Dunaway are fine perfomers, this movie was surprisingly disappointing. Most often, one's impression of a movie is based on the ending, and this movie boasted an awful ending which tarnished the entire movie. It ends suddenly and unintelligently. The overall movie was mediocre, and dragged quite frequently. I wouldn't recommend this movie unless you are a fan of one of the individual actors or actresses in the movie."
2,DVD's will not play,"I'd love to comment on the content of the film but it seems that neither of the Chinatown DVD's I recieved from Amazon will play in my DVD player. Instead they start to spin up and just make a strange noise and are otherwise not recognized. Both discs I recieved were/are in flawless shape. I have something in the neighborhood of 200 DVDs and none have ever had this issue. My DVD player is not defective, is new and a recognized brand so there just must be something wrong with the way these DVD's were made. They seem quite old from 1999 or so. I've heard of other older discs having issues like this such as the first version of ""The Deer Hunter"" so perhaps it's time this movie is rereleased so I can actually watch it. Hopefully amazon will recredit me as I've sent both of the discs back. I wish I could have watched the movie though."
3,Probably misnamed,"I spent part of my summer in LA's Chinatown district, experiencing the sights and sounds and marking another check on my list of Chinatowns visited nationwide. Almost as soon as I got home (meaning after I checked the mail, picked up the dog, turned the A/C down, and watered the plants), I rushed out to rent this film, eager to see one of my favorite vacation stops depicted on film.Sadly, that was not the case. I'm sure I would have liked the movie more, but the entire time I was thinking, ""Hey, where's Chinatown?"" ""I bet they're about to go to Chinatown now."" ""Hey, what did that guy just say about Chinatown?"" My hope turned to sadness when the credits rolled, with mere fleeting frames of the fabled location.I'm not one to use 20/15 hindsight, but perhaps the director and writer could have chosen a better name for the film. How about, ""Where's the Water?"""
1,CD did not work!,you would think the seller would post the condition of the cd before selling to an unsuspecting customer! never again will i purchase anything from this seller(fot-records) AGAIN!!! I hope everyone else will do the same! BUYER BEWARE!!!
5,Wonderful book about early west coast,"A funny account of life in early America. Worth a read for sure!!!A young city couple who take to chicken farming. They have to adapt to life without electricity, a temperamental stove, and raising children. This book is a Classic and worth a read or two! You will be laughing on every page"
3,About what you would expect....,"I remember growing up with Gallagher in the 80's, and it's great to see all of his shows together. There was a lot of funny stuff in there, and Gallagher was often more than just a prop comic. Bookkeeper, Over Your Head, and The Maddest are the true highlights here.Two notable comments:1. For some reason, the shows are out of order, with some of his earliest material in the very last DVD.2. There really isn't much to watch after We Need a Hero. The 90's and 2000 material is nothing but prop comedy and Gallagher occassionally getting angry at the crowd."
4,gallgher collection,"great set, missed gallagher from my teen yrs. Alwayswanted a set. recomend for everyone"
3,edited to be unperfect...,"...or 2.5 stars...most or all of these shows r edited; if not, it'd be 4 or 5 stars. what another shamefull unneccessary dumb waste of more good needed stuff that was shown complete on tv yet.some of the best shows i remember on here are: the maddest, over your head, melon crazy, the bookkeeper, we need a hero and stuck in the 60's. still enjoyable, especially if one's never seen these."
3,Thoughtful,"These are major issues, handled well. I purchased ""Sweet Violet"" and ""1001 Nights Exotica"" for a close friend -- in her 40s she's beginning to question her sexuality for the first time. She was very moved by the story and by the trilogy within ""1001."" It was a good balance."
5,This book has saved my bacon,I am here to tell you that on more than one occasion this book has saved my bacon. Several times in different environments I needed to use sed to correct data in flat files. Once I used sed to change the format and numbers when we wanted to match accounting numbers to a different system. I haven't used that much awk. However there has been occasion to transfer awk programs from one UNIX to a different UNIX flavor. I found that the regular awk in this book was newer than the newawk in the other system. I Still keep the book handy incase I get squeezed for time and have to manipulate files. However I am learning more and more to appreciate PERL on those occasions.
5,A Wonderful Addition,"The Fairy's Return is a retelling of the golden goose story. Robin and Princess Lark love each other, but King Harrumphrey forbids their marriage. All seems lost until the fairy Ethelinda intervenes. This story is filled with subtle wit and plays on words. If you enjoy humor and fairy tales, read The Fairy's Return!"
3,"3 and a 1/2 stars: well worth buying, its a good read!",This 1st offering from Gary Wassner shows great promise.He created a fairly unique and interesting world to set his story in. His magic and characters are interesting and provide ample room for a good tale to be told. There is some room for improvement and since this is an earlier work of his I have reason to suspect his latter books solve any problem. This work shows that Wassner is a writer to be reckoned with and I look forward to reading the next book in the series.
4,Nice pan,"The metal is a bit thin, especially on the lid. It was hard to find a pan that has a metal lid, so this is nice, but it is thinner than previous pans I've had, so don't know how long it will last."
4,"Great pan, sharp lid","This is a nice pan for cakes or whatever. Nice and smooth. Not too thin. Seems to heat evenly and wash well.Watch out though, the edges of the lid are sharp. SHARP! Wearing a bandaid this very second because my finger caught the edge of the pan while I was getting something else out of the cabinet. Be careful storing and washing and you should be fine, but I won't let my kids handle it."
2,Scrath,"My husband knew I wanted it, so he got it for me. The pan came with scratches. I don't think is gonna last, looks cheap and weak.Next time, I will pick another brand name, so disappointing."
3,Not as nice as the one that comes with the plastic lid,This is a much lighter aluminum pan than the Nordicware that comes with the plastic lid in the combo set with quarter sheet pan. I was disappointed with it and ordered a second of the one with the plastic lid. I don't expect this one to hold up for very long.
5,Great Cake Pan!,"I wanted to replace an old cake pan, that was in horrible shape. Certainly not what you want to use if you have guests over, and now it was getting embarrassing to even serve a cake in it to my family! I wanted to get something others thought of as high quality, and this one seemed to be what I was looking for, at a price I could afford. I am very happy with the quality of this cake pan, and I also really like the lid, to help keep it fresh, and it is great if you need to take your cake somewhere. I have a feeling I will be using this cake pan for many years.My one question is, does anybody know of a good cake cutter, that will cut through the cake, but not through the pan, and leave ugly marks? I would sure love to find such a thing, if it exists?"
3,Pan is not as I had hoped,"Bought two of these pans. Most of my NordicWare is very sturdy, however these pans don't seem to be made as well. A little on the light and flimsy side not to mention that when cleaning the lid, got cut on the sharp edge of the lip!"
1,Do NOT Buy,"The Nordic Ware pans with the metal lids (9x9 and 9x13) are low quality, sharp edges on lid, lid does not fit and hard to get on and off, and mine came with the base dented. Absolute junk! I also purchased the same with the plastic lids and they are great! Totally different pan in style, quality, and materials.Nordic Ware Classic Metal 9x13 Covered Cake Pan"
3,"satisfied, but not ecstatic about them","It took me a month to be able to wear these shoes comfortably. the rubber/plastic is not easily moldable and I got many blisters, etc. I didn't give up, used lots of bandaids and they are now comfortable. I wear them every day and they are great around the water, but I prefer my regular leather Birkenstocks for comfort."
5,"Mesmorizing, miraculous, and 'mazin","Wilkinson's book was beyound astounding, it was magnificent! The book went beyond normal standards and it reached a higher level of apexes. This book should not only be read in every classroom throughout the U.S., but it should be momrized, analyzed, and loved, because it is truly worth all of that. Wilkinson truly knows how to write and for that, everyone should at least read a chapter."
1,Is this supposed to be a Comedy?,Sometimes I'm not the smartest guy in the room. But seeing the peoples comments that actually believe this nonsense makes me feel a lot better about myself.
1,stupid people who only listen to those that agree,"These Idiots wouldn't know a conspiracy if it were to kill them personally. The only thing this movie shows is how easily led some people are. If it were possible to give 0 stars, I would."
1,What a waste of time!,"I'm always interested in well done 9/11 documentaries as I'm sure many people who were old enough to know what was going on are (I was in college at the time). I should have known where this movie was going when it opened with Nazi Germany. Here's the real truth - Your government is NOT out to get you (unless you're a bank robber or something, and in that case you deserve it). Just let it go already. And unless you love wasting your time on conspiracy theories, pick something else to watch."
1,Crazies,"If by the end of this, you are not screaming at the TV because of ridiculously-arrived-at conclusions, factual errors, and misleading setups that don't get tied up, take off your aluminum foil hat and look in the mirror. That is what an unhinged lunatic with no grasp on reality looks like. Also make no mistake. I have heard this called a trilogy. It is not. This is the fourth iteration of the same film. It must keep being re-edited to try to worm around disproved allegations and to remove footage it was not permitted to use in the first place. That being said, bigfoot gives this two non-opposable thumbs up."
2,Only 1 thing I like about this film.,"Before I start, I would like to say that I believe in some way, that the US was either involved or tried to cover up much of 9/11. That said, I hated this movie. It is basically one big lie to create money. Always look up things after you watch them, especially something as controversial as this.The one thing I liked about this film is that it makes people think. Maybe instead of listening to mainstream media, people would start thinking twice about it and accepting all ideas, rather than just saying someone is crazy. People are going to believe what they believe, just accept it. This is America, we have freedom to believe what we want, and for others to try and make someone stop believing, they are not patriotic or American.I wouldn't really recommend this film to anyone, I would first recommend a more questioning film rather than one that ""tells you like it is"" such as this."
1,Loose brains,"Watch the documentary that was aired on the National Geo or Discovery channel of experts looking into the claims made in this video and they explain it all and conclude that the planes brought it down. But you arm-chair experts know more, bull crap.The floors of the towers were made of concrete, which were VERY heavy, just a few weakened steal beams as seen on the news is all it would take. The weight of the upper floors on those beams caused the upper floors to come crashing down upon the floor that was hit and caused a domino effect of ever increasing weight that just smashed the towers.Use some brains people."
1,Garbage,This was made by a kid who got rejected from film school. Don't waste your money on someone who is trying to profit from the 9/11 tragedy.
5,Yummy recipes,I really enjoyed this cookbook - it had a wide variety of recipes that were both time consuming and quick. I also liked the commentary about the Riggin along the sidebars.
5,Masterpiece,"This album is so unbelievably slept on it's sick! The beats and rhymes are top notch, every song is good, I don't know how this album fell under the radar and so many people don't know of him. The sound is similar to the Alkaholiks first album, just a little more street, but not the typical west coast gangster stuff. Highly recommended!"
3,Great seat with a one year life expectancy.,"The seat looks good and works great. The soft-close feature and easy, twist off retaining snaps are wonderful ideas. The only problem I had is that, just after a year of use, the soft close feature on the seat portion stopped functioning. The top still does its soft close thing, but the seat now just slams closed. I called the company and they said it should last for 40 or 50,000 cycles. It didn't even come close. I have no options other than to buy a replacement since Bemis offers only a one year warranty. They suggested I take it up with the seller, but offered no support at all. Since the seat is attached with break-away bolts, I'll likely have to buy another Bemis so I don't have to drill out the old mounting bolts."
5,ELONGATED PLACSTIC SEAT,product was as avertised and more. delivery was fast. completely satisfied. highly recommend this product to all in need of toilet seat. Elongated Plastic Seat
2,Too many un-glued stories...,"As much as I tried to get into the book, I felt like there was too much effort to talk about a whole lot of things in a short time. There were so many events that took place, and not enough time spent to explain clearly the situation, or give a better history to the dynamics of what was happening...I also felt that the translation could have taken a lot of what the real intent was. I was not able to live the story, and get involved to what was taking place..."
2,Windows 2000,"In my humble opinion this book should have been classified as a more win32 api programming book. When I purchased it I was hoping to have a referenced comparison between systems programming in NT 4.00 and 2000. When I refer to Systems programming I refer to device driver, I/O control systems, File Systems, etc. A really big disapointment was the section on Security, Kerberos was only mentioned in the last section of the chapter.The order of topics seems strange, I guess I do not understand why ActiveX received a 100 pages in the second chapter while memory management received 20 in chapter 7."
3,"Nice AEG, but great value ???","This is NOT a bad AEG. In fact, it's very nicely made and seems to have good quality control. Initial impresssion is it's as good as the more expensive Japanes AEGs.However, there are many AK clone AEGs out on the market, and I am just a bit disappointed that there are so few metal parts on this AEG. With a few exception, its all plastic, even the magazines are plastic. Other brands have all metal body construction at a lower price.A good choice for a clone, especially if lighter weight and quality construction are important to you. But if you are looking for metal construction and that realistic hefty feel, better choice are out there."
4,Better than I thought,"I watched this a couple of days ago. It was funny, and a bit on the ""creppy"" side, but it was great. I'm glad I took the advise and watched it. Existential crisis at its best!"
1,Huh?,"An enigmatic and mysterious film of indeterminable length that seems to lack coherence and continuity. Things happen, but no one knows why. Maybe it's meant to be Hitchcockian, but, if so, it fails miserably. Even now, I'm not quite sure what I saw. Of if I even care."
2,Even the lead actress couldn't figure out this movie,"Unique beauty Emmanuelle Devos led me here (seeRead My Lipsto understand why), but 'La Moustache' is a hard movie to like despite another winning performance by this beguiling actress. While suspenseful, the movie is ultimately infuriating because like another recent French release,Cache (Hidden), not only is the viewer unable to figure it out, turns out the actors are unclear on the concept as well. Indeed, in the ""Making Of"" featurette included on the DVD, Ms. Devos literally shrugs her shoulders and admits to giving up on figuring out the movie and simply focusing on her role. Moreover, director Emmanuel Carrère and writer Jérme Beaujour tell featurette viewers that they reviewed the first cut of the film and realized that they needed to chop out the explanatory scene (hopefully the one that lets on whether it's the wife or the husband that's gone off the deep end). Maddening."
2,An exercise in futility.,This film is like two films in one. The first half of the movie (in France) is wonderfully taut and suspenseful. We wonder about the motives of the characters. The second half (in Macau) is filmed like an amateurish indy film. The ending is a frustrating exercise in disappointment and need to be explained away only by watching the interview with the director (on the DVD). I borrowed the book to compare the endings and think the book ties up the loose ends better. All in all a rather frustrating and meaningless movie after the suspense in the beginning.
2,Handy man use,This stand is functional and is OK. I feel that it should be built with more Quality. The way it was assembled was below the price. I feel that it would be a great buy at 50-65 dollars but for 100 + it is not worth it. If I could find one somewhere else I would have bought that one and return this one. I was unable to find it elsewhere so I was stuck with it. I do intend to use it and have i a long time.
3,Great addition to Baltimore patterns,This book is a great addition to the Baltimore Album style patterns you already have. There are no instructions just blocks showing the patterns. I enlarged them to fit my block size and many of them I have not seen any where else. There are also border ideas shown toward the back. I think this is a good book and a wonderful asset to any quilter's library.
4,Gassy,"I like this item a lot. It really helps you gain lean muscle quickly if you take it as recommended, and especially if you stack it with Cell-tech (creatine), but the one bad side effect i experienced is that it made me really gassy. I recommend taking it with a meal or after."
3,Nothing Amazing,"Well I didn't have the miracle experience like the other ones. I don't think you can expect incredible gains from any supplements. It does help, its better than nothing. Convenient way to get enough protein in. I don't think its something any other protein product can't do. I bought vanilla, I have tasted strawberry seemed pretty good. Vanilla really isnt that bad either. I did get sick of the taste where i despised taking it after abouta month. After a short break it didnt bother me anymore. The container says you gain 8lbs of lean mass in 6 weeks compared to 4 from other products. I doubt it works twice as well as other products. 8lbs is a lot for a 6 weeks, we would all look like body builders if this stuff worked that effective for most people. I say give it a shot if you'r not worried about price, but personally I would look for a cheaper alternative."
2,Good tutorials but very little technical information,"This book has lots of good tutorials but virtualy no technical information on the MP3 format. Also, there is not much information for musicians who want to promote their music on the Web."
2,"Christianity Today review, February 2005","""A book riven by self-contradictions and flawed by a hermeneutic so naive it beggars belief. Railing against judgment, Boyd issues sweeping judgments against the church throughout its entire history--judgments that rest almost entirely on sheer assertion."""
1,watered down antinomian easy-believism,"Book not recommended for the serious Christian or seeker.Too lopsided on one aspect of God's characterDoes not balance personal skew with God's holy wrath against sin.Please read Peter's and Paul's sermons/messages to the crowds in the Book of Acts. THAT is authentic Christian Gospel.The problem is not so much Repenting of Religion, butRepenting of SIN.See John MacArthur 'Ashamed of the Gospel' and 'Hard to Believe'and Greg Laurie 'Upside-down Church'.If anything should be repented of, it's this book and the author's unbiblical notions."
1,Not scriptural.,"Mr.Boyd is certainly in love with ""love"" and acceptance. Will he love his children in the same way as he wants us to love others? Would he let his children walk in the path of an oncomming car, because out of love, he does not want to tell them the truth? The truth is Mr. Boyd that God loves the sinner, but hates sin. Ask Jesus to forgive you and come into your heart and you will be saved. He shows us the truth in Hisword. Get back to God's word."
2,Product is good but Seller stinks,"Yesterday I wrote to this Seller stzting that I got 4 of these barrels of cheese balls, and each one had an expiration date of 1/07 --- seems like they went through their inventory and sent out everything that was old --- have not heard back from them, so that's why I am writing this. We give a lot of these out to the kids in the neighborhood as presents. Today we got another 4 from a Seller --- these 4 barrels had an expiration date of 2/25/12!!!The need to realize that taking old inventory just to get rid of it during the holiday rush doesn't really work --- it's going to be a long time before I order anything from them again..."
4,Greatest Surf Band this side of Junior Brown or Webb Wilder,Any band that does the Hawai'iFibe-0 theme song has to be good!Does anybody remember Edmonton's'Steve McGarrett's Hair'?!@
5,A gem,"I was enthralled by this book from the very first sentence. The writing is so beautiful that, even though the vast majority of the action takes place in the mind and there are many purely descriptive passages,the story seemed full of action.I appreciated the water imagery, which was consistent throughout, lending a unity to the narrative. Kitchen is not the first to use this potent imagery ( ""Those are pearls that were his eyes""; ""I should have been a pair of ragged claws . . ."") but that's because water is so elemental to everyone.I must confess that, like Molly, I am a 50-plus married woman with a passion for music, so I found lots to relate to in the book. Unlike Molly, however, I do not enjoy the works of Edna O'Brien.One quibble: I thought the portrait of the husband as a deracinated, disaffected Jewish academic was more than a little trite."
1,B-O-R-I-N-G,"I would have rated one star if it were an option. If you can finish this book, chalk it up to boredom...that's the only reason I finished it. If you can finish this book and tell a good friend that you enjoyed it, I don't even know what to say. If you suggest this book to a good friend, you're just plain mean. Every single time I began to read this book, I fell asleep within thirty minutes. I was sure something was going to happen any time. It never did. The lack of dialog may have been the main reason it didn't grab my attention, but seriously...the most uninteresting book i've read in a very long time."
2,Yeah right - Softside Hustlas,"Mane I know these clowns, we use to be kool. The album ain't horrible but it ain't no go geter either. All of the BRP know now where these fools stand, and it's alone right with this weak album!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Tryin 2 get it,"Ay yo it's an alri album wit some tight tracks. tha best tracks on tha album are 1,5 and 6. Go kop this album fo only a cent it's worth av'n aye, peaceMERC UK"
2,Only good for pronunciation,"This book is really not useful for helping learn Hebrew as a language.It was selected for our adult Hebrew class to help with pronouncing the prayers, which it is probably useful if you ignored about half the book, which introduces, but does not explain and ultimately confuses several other concepts like finding roots in other words, gammatria, etc.Please see follow up comment to Richard Ingraham's review:[...]"
3,"great movie,bad dvd","I adore this movie,it's cheesy,but classic cheesy,and it's filled to the brim with actual historical sideshowspecialties,how could you not love it?! This dvd itself hasHORRIBLE sound quality though,I know it's an old film but gimmea break."
4,"freaks, thoughts on the movie","I was astounded yet thankful that such a group of people struggling together to survive had the courage to create this movie.Having individually been the social scurge and outcast, they find a common place and then turn it around so the very people who forsook them now has to pay to see them. I applaud the cast and all others who assisted in the production of this film. Their simple humility could not be hidden. Their dignity was plainly shown for all to see. The purity of their spirit is anything but freakish yet the one they turned into a freak was given a body that matched her freakish spirit. It makes one think, ""Who really are the the freaks in this world?"" I hope they laughed their way to the bank for a job well done...the joke is on us, ""the normals?"" I do so applaud them all."
4,Freaks! Classic Movie,"Classic Movie!! Very intriguing! Sound quality is not GREAT - but is ok.I still couldn't stop watching until it was over!! Definitely recommended if you are into the twisted, etc."
3,Freaky!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is not a ""OH,WOW! You gotta see this!"", but it was definitely a one of a kind. I like how they portrayed the ""freaks"" as the normal people. It's just overall an interesting movie."
4,Chant along with the circus freaks!,"This is a ""must see"" for anyone who's never viewed it before. A weird lesson in tolerance via Tod Browning with a cast of true ""freaks"" (no make-up needed!) giving the class. Gabba-Goo-Gabba-Goo!!!!!"
3,"Interesting, but not a masterpiece","This movie is about people with real physical deformities playing sideshow freaks-one of whom is mistreated and how the other freaks join together to exact revenge. Plot is simplistic, but the movie is interesting in showing the adaptability of people with physical limitations."
3,ANYONE TO CARNIVAL?,Poignance needed! The only place I found it - and boy did I find it! - was when the armless/legless one suitored me with a seamless way of manufacturing a cigarette from a pile of tobacco and a single paper. Not for the ill of heart.
4,"""Gooble gobble, we accept, you, one of us! one of us!","An amazing film that still retains its interest despite a rather sappy sub-plot of love under the big top. Perhaps the greatest tribute one can pay to Browning is to say that he showed that ""freaks"" are not only people too, but sometimes more loving and friendly than those who are ""normal"" by our view."
5,"One of the Greats, Folks","Blinding cinematic brilliance. Meant as a cautionary tale for one to not judge by surface appearances, it succeeds on every level. This came out during an era of exploitative films such as reefer madness, and other seedy underworld pieces that were like erotic fables trying to tittilate and teach simultaneously. I don't even want to give a breakdown as to what lies within at even the chance of throwing up a spoiler. It's got zippy, caterpillar man, midget love, the bearded lady, and all your favourites. . .Mandatory for any film collector"
3,Freaks,"It is a good movie and I thought compassionate. The quality is quite good considering the year this movie was made. I would have given ""Freaks"" five stars if much of the movie had not hit the cutting room floor because, when the movie was shown in the theater, some people hated it and parts were removed."
5,Now this is a real classic.,"I saw Tod Browning's other ""classic,"" Dracula, and it was weak, boring and not scary at all. On the other hand, ""Freaks,"" a movie that could never be made today, yet hasn't aged at all in 70 years (except that the strong man is downright puny by today's standards), is powerful, moody and constantly entertaining. Betrayal, revenge, loyalty, love, and some really trippy freaks. What could be better? Ok, the sound quality could be better, but that's about all. And too bad the alternate endings have been lost. ""One of us"" the freaks say to the lovely but evil trapeze artist, but she's not one of them--she doesn't deserve to be! Definitely one of the all-time greats."
5,"""Freaks""","This movie is disturbing, surreal, and genuinely shocking at times. In places the movie seems to be following a familiar plotline, then stuns you from your lull with a shocking scene or unexpected revelation. There has been much controversy about this film due to the use of real ""freaks,"" which has been labelled exploitation. It's shocking when you first realize you aren't looking at Hollywood special effects. But it is not just their deformities that are so hypnotic; the actor who plays Hans the dwarf's performance is bitter and chilling at times, passionate and touching at others. The menace and intensity that the freaks radiate in the final scenes is both genuine and vividly portrayed. If not for this film, we would never have seen this beautiful acting from men and women who might never have been on film otherwise. Wonderful for it's story, poignant for its acting, and frightening in its implications, ""Freaks"" is one of the defining movies of the horror genre."
2,The D in Big D Films just may stand for 'DUD' - who knows?,"FREAKS is definitely an unusual movie and has an assured place in motion picture history. My 2-star rating is NOT for the film itself.The question here is product QUALITY.I've been checking out various offerings from this gray market dealer. Seems reviewers give their movies either 5 star or 1 star ratings. While one will laud their superior transfer quality the next absolutely trashes it as THE WORST. Very contradictory. VERY confusing! Also, I've seen a single new reviewer who's posted 5 reviews, four of which are five-star BIG D ones. That's too coincidental for me!I won't spend significant bucks to find out which is correct: the raves or the brickbats. There's too many viable options out there to take a chance, IMO.Caveat emptor, folks."
4,Great 1930s movie,This was a great movie. It has a busy story line and multiple characters. One thing you will need to do is turn the volume on your tv up. The sound is very quiet at some parts compared to newer movies. Excellent if you appreciate older movies and old fashioned beauty.
1,One of worst films ever,"Watching ""Freaks"" is like witnessing a terrible accident. It's disgusting but one can't quite will oneself to stop looking. The writing is the worst--second place ain't close. Unfortunate people with unfortunate afflictions are exploited for the idle amusement of ""normal"" folk. The plot is ridiculous and obvious. In short, it just doesn't get any worse than this. Perhaps, then, that's what makes new fans for this movie when much better movies of the period are in oblivion. As Mencken said, ""No one ever went broke under-estimating the taste of the American people."" END"
1,Do NOT Buy,"The Nordic Ware pans with the metal lids (9x9 and 9x13) are low quality, sharp edges on lid, lid does not fit and hard to get on and off, and mine came with the base dented. Absolute junk! I also purchased the same with the plastic lids and they are great! Totally different pan in style, quality, and materials.Nordic Ware Classic Metal Covered Square Baker, 9 by 9 InchNordic Ware Classic Metal Covered Square Baker, 9 by 9 Inch"
5,Great puzzle for girly-girls,"I have a princess-obsessed 2 year old who loves this puzzle. Fun to mix and match and make her favorite combinations. And as always, great quality from Melissa & Doug."
4,Peg Board,"I have 2 girls, 19 months & 2 1/2. I purchased it for my 2 1/2 year old, but both girls love it. The pieces fit easily in their spots, there is no pushing to get the pieces in. Nice change in boards, my girls are tired of the food/transportation boards. This is a nice change."
5,EXECELLENT TOY,REMINDS ME OF THE PAPER DOLLS I PLAYED WITH AS A CHILD. I THINK THIS TO BE AN EXCELLENT GIFT.
5,"Muddy Waters & The Rolling Stones, Oh yeah!","Here we are bringing the Stones, up close, personal, and back to the roots. Muddy Waters, what can I say? Muddy was the teacher. Muddy is like the best wine over time. It gets better and better.This DVD puts you in the front row, center. It's no different than you being up there and part of the party at Buddy Guy's house.If you would like sitting at Mick Jagger's table at Buddy Guy's house, this DVD is for you.*¿*~"
2,Good music,It was a great DVD. But I did realize it was a DVD. I wanted a CD. It would have been nice if it came with both
3,A tad bit boring.,"I live in Chicago and went to the Checkerboard Lounge as a kid when it was still open. Did not get to see this show live so I was interested in finally seeing it after all these years. It's the entire show, kind of off the cuff performance. Some may really dig the candid aspect of the show, but for me...it was ok."
3,The cost of the item is misleading,"I purchased this item for myself and another identical one for a present, the total cost was $33.98 plus $8.97 for shipping and handling stated clearly on the invoice. However, I had to pay a further 13.39 to the Post Office and had to collect it myself as the shipping cost was inadequate.This made the product much more expensive and inconvenient at having to collect it.I would therefore recommend that buying items shipped from abroad I will no longer be doing and suggesting to friends that they wait before agreeing to paying out such astronomical prices for delivery, quite an insult to have been mislead so much."
4,pressed wrong button,Pressed wrong button. Tried to change review earlier. Do not know why that did not work. Evidently cannot delete review. Tried.
5,Chiefs,The quality of the Chiefs DVD was poor. It was fuzzy and the color was often off. The other DVDs were great.
4,Master Jam,An excellent jam session and very good quality for the time. The Stones playing with some of their idols is priceless...and it is definitely worth the purchase price!
4,A Great Evening Of Music,"This dvd is must for music fans. One of those shows where it would be great to say ""i was there"", but alas those us who weren't can still enjoy it. A good picture and sound sure do bring it to life. Would've given this 5 stars but those expecting the whole thing to be all the stones & muddy might be dissapointed a bit. Should've been called ""muddy & friends"" there's a heap of good buesmen on this,you will still love it."
5,5 star,"A great blues jam session. Buddy Guy, Muddy Waters, The Rolling Stones together, how good it that? Video and music remix is well done. A gem of a DVD."
3,Interesting gig in a small club with Muddy,"I have recently become a Muddy Waters fan, even though we have all heard his music, since the 60's from rock bands. It is great to see where these songs came from. It was really cool to see him with the Rolling Stones, but they were only involved for part of the dvd. Still worth having."
5,outstanding,the filming of the act was raw and almost amateur in appearance with cameramen walking in front of the performers at times but that just added to the feel of being in a Chicago blues bar as contrasted with the overhyped and over done productions of todays pop stars. This felt real
5,muddy waters & the rolling stones,I love it. Play it in my car. It's the only one I play besides Joe Moss & Nick Moss's c d's.
4,Must-read on early 20th century Middle East history,"Koestler, a leading intellectual in the middle of the last century, turns his famously skeptical and unbiased eye on the 30 years that preceded the founding of the State of Israel. Based on copious research, personal experience, and clear thinking, his analysis reveals how the situation that exists today in the Middle East reflects the factors that shaped developments almost a century ago, beginning with the Balfour Declaration. This document legitimized Zionist aspirations, and its later abrogation was a key factor in the turn from peaceful colonization to violent confrontation that persists to the present."
1,Damaged goods... Pay attention to vendor name.,"The item was damaged, and previously a returned item. Half of the wire top was not attached.Guessing from the vendor name and the fact that this was a previously opened item, I believe it was a defective item. The vendor is less than scrupleous to send defective items... fool me once... never again!"
4,A decent intro to Debian,"I came into this as a Unix user, never having administered anything a day in my life. I thought it was an execllent introduction for a new user - one book can't be all things to all people. But the installation guide was great for someone who has never touched a Linux install before. I'll agree with one of the above reviewers... it could stand to be a little more in-depth with core Linux daemons like apache and sendmail. I did think the section on Samba was outstanding, but was a little confused when it came the entire section on networking and BIND. A little less on programming with TCL and Python, and a little more on the common tasks the administrator takes on every day.Still, I think it's a great primer, and it was certainly enough that I got a box up and running without too much of a headache."
4,Debian GNU/Linux 2.1 Unleashed,"I was more or less forced into learning Linux for my job. This was the 1st book I bought regarding Debian Linux and I have learned an extensive amount of information regarding Linux.The book does a very good job starting with the very basics of Linux to advanced server administration. There was also a very interesting section on securing your Linux server.With the help of this book, I've successfully set up a web/intranet/ftp/mail server at my workplace. I would highly recommend this book."
5,Great CDs for general/music burning,"I got a stack of these CDs for using while DJing. I don't need a fancy printer for my CDs but wanted something with no logos so I could write on the whole surface. Other than that, they are a standard CD-R. They have worked well and I haven't had any error CDs from the entire stack.The Pros: No logos on the CD surface, reasonable price; no error CDsThe Cons: as with any CD, they get a scratch and they skipOverall: If you aren't making CDs for production, these are a great CD and can be labeled with a permanent marker very easily."
4,Good Product -- Good Value,"I use these CD-Rs for church (sermon distribution). They have worked well, and I've had no problems. I use an Epson RX680 printer to print the top surface. The only reason I didn't give them five stars is that I've not used other products with which to compare. But, I like the price of these, and will continue using them."
2,Way too wordy,"Bought this book based on other reviews that said it filled a gap of providing a good commentary on walks around Jerusalem without being overpowering. I beg to differ! Just reading a few pages made my eyes glaze over. No way could I stay awake and read an entire ""tour"" of 20+ pages. Way too many tangents within the ""tours"". Should have pulled those out in a sidebar. Great idea for a book, but poorly executed IMHO."
2,"Major gaps, info biased","This book is most helpful regarding the Old City's Christian Quarter. The other ""tours"" outside the Old City walls are interesting from an Israeli/Jewish perspective since they have such a bias. The author repeatedly points out how slummy and garbage-strewn certain areas were before the Jewish immigrants tidied things up. I found that annoying. On my most recent visit, I was most interested in learning more about the Mughabi Quarter formerly located in front of the Western Wall. This author mentions that Morroccans once lived there but neglects to explain that Israel bulldozed the entire neighborhood just days after the Six-Day War. That's a grave omission."
5,"Mr Big, thx for all the years of music","This band, I hope, will go down in history as one of the best ""all-star-bands"" ever put together. Superfantastic (and its 'b-side' ""You Dont Have to be Strong"") are wonderful melodic ballads, really showcasing Eric Martin's voice and Ritchie Kotzen's acoustic work. The gem, however, is their cover of the Deep Purple Classic ""Burn""! Hearing Kotzen copp Blackmore's amazing solo reminds me of his talent, and how glad I was that he found this band to work in! Eric Martin out-does himself (and Coverdale) on the vocals, and you're hearing this from a GIANT David Coverdale fan! Sheehan even gives a go on Jon Lord's solo (originally done on an organ), and although this fiery solo outdoes even the solos by Jaco Pastorius (once again, a Jaco fan saying this!), a Bass solo is not really warrented for this song...regardless, a great job on a great song!If you can find this, GET IT! Its worth it!"
2,"Amusing, somewhat educational, but could be cropped down","Some fascinating cultural studies in this travel video, but it tends to be overly-long, and frequently gets bogged down in inane sequences such as Palin kicking back endless shots of illegal vodka in Russia, etc. The FULL frontal nudity at the mud bath could also have been clipped, as well as the nude men at the sauna. I don't know if Palin was aiming at Pythonesque humor with this, but it didn't work for me.Something like 'Hemingways Travels' was far for fascinating, clean, and better edited. This one needed editing badly."
5,Perfect for the armchair traveler!,A great series which takes you to places off the beaten track and introduces you to some wonderful areas. Michael Palin's humor makes the trip twice as enjoyable.
5,Must see for fans of traveling shows,Michael Palin provides an offbeat and interesting documentary of his trip from the North Pole to the South Pole. This video makes you wish you could have gone with him!
1,How badly to treat an opera,I am sure Verdi turned over in his grave when he saw how badly his opera was presented.Having cowboys and Indians mixed up on the set was plainly disgusting. There were other parts that I did not like. They replaced the ballet with cowboys and indians.
1,try another version,"This was my first viewing of La Forza and I will try again with another version. As the first reviewer says, attempts to add color - ie cowboys - when the setting presumably involves Spaniards and Incas - fall flat. In fact this production involves a mishmash of historical references that just complicate an already complicated (not complex) opera. Paradoxically, most of the singing is of the old-fashioed 'park and bark' variety! I'll try another production before I write the opera off completely."
4,THE BEST BOOK EVER?,"This book was kickin',ok well not everyone one would say so, but I would. This book has everything from acton to sorrow. It also has good structure and all the parts a book needs. If you like sci fi check this book out and if you don't then why ya readin' this. And also for all you Star Wars fans check out the other ""Galaxy of Fears"" books."
4,It was Exciting!,"The book was really exciting . I had lots of fun reading this book . I read it pretty quick . The book is about two children, brother and sister, they land in a planet called D'vouran . The people from D'vouran are nice , but then people started to disappear and if you want to know the rest read the book ."
3,It's almost worth buying.,"Tash is the main character of this story. Hoole, Zak, and Tash land on D'vouran, where a madman tells everyone in the village that people are disappearing. Tash also has a strange feeling about the planet and its inhabitints, the Enzeen. It turns out that D'vouran is an experiment run by the Empire. It is the beginning of a long stream of adventures that Tash, Zak, and Hoole go through. If you haven't read any of the Galaxy of Fear books, then read this one first. Each one is better than the last."
3,Book 3 keeps it going,"The third installment of the Anita Blake series pits our favorite necromancer against a vampire looking to make her his human servant and a giant cobra. Of course, Jean-Claude's none too thrilled about that as he wants Anita for himself. She needs him, too, but she also has her reservations.This series introduces us a bit more into the world of lycanthropes and we meet another big player in the series, Richard Zeeman. He's Jean-Claude's wolf to call, and more competition for Anita's heart.Building on the themes of the first two books, Anita grows more into her powers. I was glad to see Jean-Claude get more screen time in this book compared to the second. There is plenty of action and I enjoyed this book a bit more than the second. It's less gory, but you still feel the grit of the underworld. At this point in the series, I recommend continuing onto book 4."
3,JUST ANOTHER ENDLESS BAD DAY FOR ANITA---,"So far this series does not have a good ratio of good times to bad. Not that it needs to be 50/50, but cover-to-cover misery makes me grumpy. It's like reading about someone's perpetually bad day. All-in-all, I felt unsatisfied after reading this book. It just lacked something. It was more like a bit of a story here and a bit of a story there, but not a lot of anything. Filler material really, interesting tidbits but not fulfilling. Another reviewer called this book hot...I must have missed those pages."
4,What happened to the Characters?,"While re-reading this book after I finishd the series I realized something, every single character, from Anita and Jean-Claude, down to Irving step completely out of character. While this book is by far, probably the most humorous book in the series, its characters are sorely lacking. It's a must read, simply for its hilarity, and for the rest of the series to make sense, to get through the book, you mustn't take the characters too seriously."
5,An awesome book,"_Circus of the Damned_ is the third Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter book. Anita Blake is an animator who makes a living raising the dead. In this book, Anita is drawn into the vampire politics of St. Louis when new vampires come to town and want her for a human servant. Anita is a clever, humorous, tough heroine, and I highly recommend this book."
5,Audio - another dimension to the written word,"I do enjoy Laurell K Hamilton's writing. I enjoy how she has changed over the years in her writing. Listening to the Audio CD's gives another dimension to her books. Since I only buy the unabridged versions, I enjoy the fact that the book I have read in the past is now available for me to listen to on those crazy drives to work. It calms me down...even as the action increases in the books. Love it!"
5,Extremely Entertaining!,"Anita Blake does it again! Only this time she gets to choose between two hotties(^_______^), Jean-Claude, the vampire hottie extrodanaire, and Richard, the nice guy from next door. This proves wildly entertaining! (CHOOSE JEAN-CLAUDE, ANITA, CHOOSE JEAN-CLAUDE!)There is nothing wrong with the boys from next door, but personally I think Anita needs to get herself a huge piece of Jean-Claude!:D"
4,fun read,"I love this series!I love Anita Blake, she is one of themost entertaining lead characters I have come accross. You can't help but love her.Hamilton continues to develop, and bring us more and more into this world she has created in this series.I highly recommend this series, but don't start here you will have missed to much. Start at the beginning with Guilty Pleasures. You won't be disappointed"
5,Great Book!,"Laurell K. Hamilton really really pushed her skills all the way,with this one. This is one of the few best books in the world.The other best books are the other Anita Blake Books."
3,Had to put the series down,"Since reading Twilight and more so the Sookie Stackhouse series I have been craving good vampire/supernatural reads however this series has not been able to hold my attention. I forced myself through books 1-3 hoping it would get better but have not been able to pick it back up again even though I bought them all! I don't like the way Anita Blake is described physically with cuts all over her body, she almost seems mutated. Her attire seems outdated and frumpy and I don't feel what lure she could have to the master vampire. Bottom line is that I have not been able to connect with her character. Soon, I'll run out of books on my reader and I'm hoping when I pick up the next book in this series and I'll be hooked. I love a book that I can't put down and unfortunately this series hasn't shown me one yet."
4,The best entertainment in days,"My wife has been pushing and pushing to get me to read one of these books.Heh. I'm pretty impressed. New readers to the series won't find this to be too bad of a starting off point. Everything is pretty nicely explained, and the action is fast and grisly.There's plenty of violence and lust to go around. Anita is portrayed pretty vividly, and it's clear that she makes some pretty tough choices as she goes along. She's got a great narration voice.The ending is a little pat, and it doesn't really explain why Anita puts up with Bert, her boss, but otherwise, this is a pretty fun book."
3,Series Moving Along Nicely,"If I could give 3 and a half stars, I would. With the exception of the spelling and grammatical errors and the way-too-quick ending, this was a very enjoyable read. A million-year-old vampire??? Please! But the rest of the book was good enough for me to overlook those problems. Finally, Anita is developing real relationships with other characters, both with friends and possible lovers. The action is fast and the body count is high. Hamilton's world is shaping up nicely and I'm looking forward to book # 4, THE LUNATIC CAFE, which I hear is one of the best."
4,Great Book,"So I needed a Vamp fix after Black Dagger Brotherhood (best series I have read so far action, drama, passion, romance ...the works). So I decided to check out Anita Blake, it was not what I expected there has been no romance, or steamy scenes of any kind so far Im on book 3....but I AM NOT disappointed the action and drama is fast paced. I love a cycnical kick @$$ chick. I bought the first 11 and intend to read them all. It's a great series, very gory, gritty, and abit scary I LUV it;)Hard to stop reading once you start! I just wish she would get with Jean-Claude already..."
5,Circus of the Damned,"Laurell K. Hamilton is an awesome writer. I discovered her books by accident while looking on Amazon for DVD's of ""True Blood"". I read the critic reviews and decided to take a chance and purchased her first one of the Vampire series. Guilty Pleasures. I am now getting ready to finish book #3 Circus of the Damned. The books are well written and very hard to put down.Each book starts with another story but also talks about the last one and they all tie together. Definitely not for younger readers due to the graphic nature but a great read for fans of the undead."
5,Best author! Very good book.,"This is the third in LKH's Anita Blake Vampire Hunter Series, and as usual this book is excellent. I'm sure that someone out there doesn't like this series and can tear it to pieces, I'm not that person. In this book Anita is having problems (again) with Jean-Claude, her nemisis and walking fantasy. Jean-Claude is a vampire who wants to possess Anita in more ways than one. Someone bigger and badder than Jean-Claude is in town and Anita has to decide who she wants to back in the final confrontation. The in/famous Richard is introduced in this book. I'll let you form your own opinion, you either love him or hate him. I am partial to the witty repartee between J-C and Anita. The secondary characters in this book just won't stay secondary. You'll fall in love with moody Asher, fun-loving Jason and too many more to name. This is a must read series!"
4,Anita...,"Have you read Mercedes Lackey's Diana Tregarde novels and wished there were more out there like them? This is where you need to be looking. Anita is certainly her own character and she has an attitude I love. The characters in these novels are gripping and seem realistic, for a bunch of supernatural creatures that is. The relationships and characters all feel like real people. I have read them all and it only gets better."
2,Large burn inside,"This book appeared to be in great shape, but had several pages burned (pp. 4 - 35), some more severely than others. It was bad enough that some paragraphs could not be read."
3,Circus of the Damned--Kindle Version,"While I'm enjoying reading this next installment of Anita Blake's adventures, I'm a little concerned with the format it came in.I purchased the kindle version of this book and it came pre-highlighted-- as if I had purchased it out of a used bookstore! Not only that, but my kindle keeps crashing as I try to read this story.I'd highly recommend the book to any fans of Anita Blake, but I'd highly suggest you spend the extra 99 cents to get the paperback copy. The kindle version simply is more of a headache than it's worth!"
3,worth it...,"I enjoy the Anita Blake series because they are entertaining and a fast read. :) Plus, hello, vampires? YES! :)"
1,Plain bad,"The concepts might be spot-on, but the presentation is not. The book adopts the narrative, rambling styles so common in college textbooks these days. It doesn't define its terms well or link its terms with its graphs.Manages to make introductory Macroeconomics more difficult than it should be.ON THE SEARCH FOR BETTER TEXTBOOKS!If someone knows a decent one, put it up in a review for others to see."
5,Excellent resource for an intriguing small group Bible study,"Our small group Sunday School class (about 12 adults ranging from about 25-55) used this resource for a 12 week study. There are six lessons, but as we tend to be chatty, we lengthened our time on each. Not only did we find the material intriguing and the theme unusual, but it also inspired us as a group to take a families trip to a nearby aquarium at the end of our study. This is not an overly preachy Bible study, but it does provide sound scriptural resource for looking at a natural and spiritual resource in a new and refreshing way."
4,Very good companion book.,"I liked this book because it gave me what I needed to know to comfortably pass the 50-634 exam without getting bogged down with too much detail. I used it as a study aid along with my class textbook and selftest software. Good discussion on time synchronization, WTM.NLM, and merging. There are questions at the end of each chapter and at the end of the book that can be used to really test your knowledge. Would be better if these questions were on CD or the publisher's website. I liked the treatment the book gave regarding an IP environment - it enabled me to answer two or three real exam test questions that I otherwise may have missed. I really rate this book at 4 1/2 stars, almost a 5. The Cram Sheet of key facts provided at the front of the book is more of a marketing gimmick than anything else; it's OK for a quick review before you go into the exam but don't rely on it for anything else."
2,The Decline of Our Gang,"Do not confuse the 52 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer shorts with the classic comedies produced by Hal Roach Studios. When Roach sold Our Gang to MGM in 1938, the creative spark quickly diminished until the series became unwatchable. Apart from the initial 1938-39 shorts (highlighted by ""The Little Ranger,"" ""Aladdin's Lantern,"" ""Men in Fright"" and ""Alfalfa's Aunt""), these one-reel travesties lack the charm and spontaneity of the Roach efforts. Spanky, Buckwheat and the gang were badly served by MGM's joyless, heavy-handed approach. On the plus side, the DVD set features excellent and uncut 35mm prints - which cannot be said for the sloppy RHI/Genius ""Little Rascals"" collection."
4,"More polished MGM version ~ Better of the series ~ in my ""books""","Can't wait to re-view them again ~These shows were syndicated 4 yrs ~The Our Gang ""complete "" collectionwere interesting history pieces ~not as fun & polished as this bunchI thought theThe Our Gang ""complete"" collectionincluded these episodes ~ oh we'll :("
1,Our Gang + MGM = Bad Comedy,"I'm amazed at the reviewers who have given this Our Gang DVD collection five stars. We're talking Spanky and Company at their worst! The first half-dozen shorts from 1938 are OK, then MGM trashes the series beyond recognition. Though Hal Roach stopped producing comedy shorts for economic reasons, it must have pained him to see what Leo the Lion did to his beloved property. If you are truly an Our Gang completist, then consider Roach's ""Hide and Shriek"" the grand finale."
5,"Highly recommended, definitive, ""user friendly"" guide.","This definitive guide goes into much more technical computer detail than more casual coverages for lay readers, introducing users to all aspects of the technology and covering the basics of how to use, optimize and maintain MP3 files using both commercial and Open Source methods for four basic operating system platforms. A highly recommended pick for musicians and computer users alike, this tells how to get the most out of equipment and MP3 music formats. Highly recommended."
4,IT HAS A VERY REASONABLE PRICE,"""MP3: The Definitive Guide"" comes at a reasonable price. It is a good text, which provides a complete coverage of MP3 using four major platforms: Windows, Linux, Macintosh, and BeOS.Users, particularly those who understood the basic mechanics of MP3, will benefit from the near-limitless information jam-packed in this 400-paged text. Right from the scratch, this book took care of every aspect of: obtaining, recording, and optimizing MP3 files using either commercial or open source methods, or both.Whether you are having a hard time evaluating playbacks or burning CDs, this book will reveal a lot to you. It also has sections that were dedicated to equipment testing, control and co-ordination, as well as file sharing with enthusiasts on the Internet. The main blemish I found on this book is that most MP3 novices may find some chapters difficult. The author, Scot Hacker, assumed that his audience are already familiar with the MP3 basics."
2,Starts off good but.....,"The book starts off in a concise manner and the author takes great care to make sure that the reader understands the basic concepts of LM2. However, the deeper that you get into the book the lessons start to fall apart. For example the ""remote rollover"" section does not work as scripted in the lesson. I also noticed in some of the other lessons (ie. CH 14. The Artist section) that although the lesson works, when you try it the code does not come out clean. The author does a good job with explaining basic animation principles but a terrible job with explaining the scripting. So if you understand scripting but can't get the animation aspects down then this might be a good book. Otherwise look around for something else."
4,One hell of a businessman,"Schwensen's business-like nature is sometimes annoying. He name-drops a lot and fawns over the genius of Carrot Top, offering as evidence of his creativity the fact that he makes money. But if you can supply the artistry, Schwensen definately knows the business. He has a lot of direct, useful information about how to market your act at all levels of competition, from novices to headliners."
5,The Best Guide,"This is the best guide to have if you're serious about working as a comedian. Has proven ways to promote yourself and get bookings. The interviews were very helpful, (Drew Carey, Carrot Top, agents and managers, etc.), and outline the importance of being creative both on stage and off. This is about the business of being funny and getting work in the comedy industry. I've read others, but this is the book I'll use the most."
3,Valuable but not not concise,I believe this is probabaly an obligatory book for any person aspiring to become a professional comic and/or writer. Personally I found it cumbersome and a tiring read.
2,Does not offer much,"This book deals exclusively with the business side of stand-up. It tells you what you need and what is important but only gives simple suggestions on how to achieve it. Also there is advice from comedieans at the end but none of the comedieans are headliners or big. Overall, this book is not for stand-up tips but basically a listing of what is needed to succeed in the business."
3,Can be of some help,"Apparently you have to be born a comedian, and born with a good business sense too. Then you keep practicing, practicing, practicing, in the clubs, not just in front of the mirror, then you might realize your dreams. In the opening chapter, an authority tells us that there are only 20 comedians who are really any good. The statistical chances of comedy success? Not really mentioned. Authors like people to be happy with their books. While you read the book, you can become anything you want. When reality sets in, at least you had fun when you read the book. But initiative, courage, and persistence, which are recommended, are good qualities in any field, so if you can't make it here, you can take these nice qualities with you in some other endeavor."
4,Educational,"Educational, deep and well written. A bit difficult to grasp at times, but I guess that's just Freud"
2,A Great Disappointment,"I greatly admire Freud, and I have greatly benefited from psychotherapy. But however great his ideas, his writing is ABYSMAL. He writes like a philosopher who has never met a patient. He'd rather write four pages of abstract theory than a single paragraph of concrete example.We all owe a mighty debt to those disciples who presented his work in a way that others could understand."
3,It's good - but....,"I've been programming for around 8 months and was looking for a book to give me some extra hints.Well, if I could have flicked though this book before I brought it. I simply wouldn't have brought it!Anything in this book - my normal VB book has already covered, and the things that my normal book didn't cover, I found on the internet anyway - So I could have saved my money.If you're a beginner who has been programing for less then a couple of months and your normal VB book isn't that comprehensive, then I would look at buying this book. But if you've got a big VB book (something over 1000pgs or so) then you could probably do without this bookOn the positive side, this book contains a lot of answers to questions, although the examples aren't all that crash hot!If you can, physically look though this book before you buy it!"
2,There's better books out there..,"It's not that this book is bad - it's just that it's not very good either. Originally written in the 1940's, it has been updated by the author, and is now in third edition. The biggest problem is that there are still many lines which are analyzed in-depth which you simply won't see - and that's not good if you're new to openings. Also, as mentioned in a previous review, the Author discounts some lines, which have undergone a resurgence in recent time, and *are* now used.Having said that, the book has been updated for algebraic notation, and is laid out in a reasonably clear and logical manner.All in all, there are better books out there, Gabor Kallai's Basic Chess Openings, and More Basic Chess Openings are excellent references, and cover all modern openings in detail. They were also written in 1997, which means they cover the sort of lines you will see at club and tournament levels."
3,Classic but Outdated,"What to say about a great classic that is well past its ""best before"" date. Fine's book was nothing short of revolutionary when it was written and remains arguably the best of its kind---a coherent overview of the main opening systems. It has spawned a number of pale modern imitations (eg. Gary Lane's very weak ""Modern Ideas Behind the Chess Openings"") which lack the breadth and reach of Fine's. That said, this would no longer serve as an all-purpose introduction to opening theory. Modern chess practice has simply evolved enormously, especially over the last 20 years. As a result, Fine's treatment of the major openings shows its age and, unfortunately, its obsolescence."
1,"A Classic To Know, Feel Smug About, But Not Esp. Useful","This is one of those ""classic"" books that, having read, allows you to feel superior to those barbarians who haven't been so enlightened. The truth though is that Fine isn't the only one with the ""ideas behing the chess openings"" - contemporary writers, with equal access to these ideas AND current variations have written equally good books. Actually, the layout of variations within Fine's book make it of little use if you're a casual tournament player looking for some info on a specific opening. Really, this is a bookshelf book. You know: a classic work, in its day, not all that useful now. Just like Ptolemy, or Copernicus, or Newton wrote classic works, Fine's relevance is mainly historical. Try Kallai, or Basman, or Reuben, or even Nunn's Chess Openings, for better practical help."
3,Disappointment,"I have owned this book for years and continue to go back to it for quick overviews of an opening. It is the only short one volume discussion of the basic themes of the opening. The language is obtuse, but the explanation of basic opening principles is useful.So much of chess is tactical. Knowing the general themes doesn't help all that much."
5,Great book!,"While this isn't a book for the casual player, it will help a player who wants to study the game by giving him or her insight into how to approach and play the opening, in general. This is accomplished, somewhat surprsingly, through the lucid explanation of specific lines and typical plans across across a wide range of openings. The benefit of Fine's work is that a diligent reader eventually sees more than the thickets of variations, and comes to understand how and why openings are played the way they are by the game's strongest players. If you're looking for a reference work with lots of modern variations and sub-variations, this isn't for you. If you want to learn how to play the opening in chess, this is a great book!"
4,A very good book,"I got this and ""Unbeatable Chess Lessons for Juniors"" which have really worked together to help me win more games.This book outlines the openings (not too many variations) and tell you the ideas behind them. Then with the ""Unbeatable Chess Lessons for Juniors"" book I found examples of games using openings with more explaination. These two books should be sold as a set."
3,Usefull only for beginners,"If you don't know much about opening play than this is certainly a good book for you. Fine outlines the ideas behind some of the chess openings in a nice way. His treatise on 1.e4 e5 and 1.d4 d5 is very good and certainly of use even for the intermediate player but the chapters about some other openings are exceptionally poor (e.g. the Benoni, the Scandinavian and the Pirc to name a few). In addition quite a number of opening lines are rather outdated. This should be your first book on openings, but you'll need some more information from other books to play your openings well."
3,Too many errors!,"I'm happy with the content of the book so far, but too many errors were apparently introduced in this version with the algebraic notation. I've been saving the games in my computer to be able to study them, and so for out of 4 games 2 have mistakes in them!! I'm spending more time figuring out what the errors are than in studying the ideas behind the openings. It's so annoying. I wish I could find a previous version."
2,Really not up-to-date,"This book is a classic probably because the author is a classic too and also because there maybe isn't any other book that presents all the opening systems in chess.But, I must admit that the basic knowledge on the systems is very small and the variations are too old. Working with ECO (Encyclopedia of Chess Opening) I came to consider this book misleading. Is there any other book explaining the basic of all the openings?"
2,Too many things wrong with this book,This book is over rated. The problems are that the book doesn't have that most telling of the ideas like it says (I am still left wondering want is the idea behind many moves) and what it covers is not up to date.
3,"The title says: ""ideas"" and ""openings""","I've found this a good book. Well I'm pretty conservative, so due to some minor points, only 3 stars. It is a reprint (with algebraic notaion) of a dated book. The book discusses the ideas of the main lines of all the most known openings. Well written but a bit dated and with little depth in the discussion of variants. It contains some good description of the typical ""patterns"", but more would have been better. The adaption to algebraic notation has introduced quite some errors in the notation, hence read carefully."
4,deserves 4.5 stars,"I would like to give it 4.5 stars.The best thing about this book is it truly coversspecific ideas about each side's ideas in each oepning.The key here is ""specific"" (not just king-side attck versusqueen-side)The only gripe I have is that it does not coveras many oepnings as one would hope. e.g. it does notcover Pirc (e4 d6)."
1,Clearly not a great choice for beginners,"I learned to play chess over 37 years ago but didn't play much after college. I recently started studying it when friends at work got me back into the game. I'm sure I'm only in the 800s if was to get a rating.A friend loaned me this book and other than the 10 principles in the first chapter it immediately loses a beginner. The errors identified in the other reviews are a big clue that this is not a great work. I had a terrible time trying to follow several of the games on a board and so I gave up.For a beginner, I have found, ""Discovering Chess Openings"" by John Emms to be very good book. At least I understand what the author is saying and he starts at a level I can grasp and builds from there."
4,"very good, but not enough info","To me, this book was a good first step in opening theory. However, it needs to be updated, and has MANY errors (typos, not analytical). What always bothered me was that it only went into the ""main lines"" of openings for the most part, and in some instances avoided some of the riskier yet popular variations. I still highly reccommend it.I just bought Standard Chess Openings, by Schiller. I like it even more, as it has analysis of landmark games for all of the openings listed. I might choose that as the next step after Fine's book."
3,Blunders; Blunders!,"The general focus of any chess book is to indoctrinate the novice or the amateur to focus on the King's pawn (Black to play focuses on White's ""f7""). I think that all amateur players should be let into the great secret of the modern chess opening--here it is. White to begin and play will usually open with e4 and will naturally be looking to hold the d4 position on the board with its next move. Any book that can't practice or impart this wisdom upon the novice is an utter shambles. This author fails to spill the beans and empower the new kids."
4,Thailand Village Life in the 1900s,"This book is really interesting.It illustrates life in Thailand then.People live in attap houses and their main source of food is rice.Buffaloes were one of the animals they depended on for farming.Dawan is a girl who is 14 years old,and Kwai,her brother is 13 years old.At that time,there was gender discrimination and boys were more important than girls.Mostly boys were allowed to study.Dawan got to study because Kwai insisted so after he started school shortly.This book is very touching and I think all of you should read it."
1,Horrible Video,"This turned out to be just a horrible video. It is not all what is represented on the box or the description as given on Amazon. According to Amazon, I bought the last one, so I did everyone a favor by depleting the supply of these DVD's so that nobody else will make the mistake that I did by buying this garbage. Which, by the way, is exactly where this video went - into the garbage can."
5,GREAT BOOK,"Very cool book with cool photos and information about the classic gaming systems. It's not a ""in depth"" reading, but it's very fun."
2,BORING - and I like this author!,Don't buy this book It is seriously boring. Lets see - which 12 words shall I select...? It was a mistake
3,Amul ghee,Have generally enjoyed this product over a few years-but found that one container (of 6-1 lb. size that I was shipped) so far had quite inferior ghee-with the milk fat still present-made me a bit sick-and threw away rest of container.
5,This Stuff is Great,"So I bought this after watching an Alton Brown episode where he talks about Ghee being clarified butter, the best you can get, and really deals with high heat. I put it in fridge, and I scooped out what I thought was about 1/4 cup spoonful for my cooking last night. Wow! Cooks well; no more smoke than cooking on any high heat setting, and I had some left over. I think maybe you should use less than you originally use of other oils as this does not evaporate the same. Really cool stuff, and no additional taste of french fries, or other stir-fried items. Coolness!!"
1,What a waste of money !!!!!!!,"I had high hopes for this product...just to be completely let down by the broken lids on both jars which let the ghee leak all over the shipping box! It was shipped with broken lids from the seller because the 2 pieces of broken lid were NOT in the box!!!!!!!!!! I will NEVER buy anything from this seller again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BE WARNED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The ghee was runny, probably from sitting in storage at the seller's business with air getting to the product through the broken lids."
4,"Great actors, great acting and great imaging.","I immediately fell into the story. Fell so deep, I started drinking water by the pitcherfull. The set was soooooooooo believeable that I was thirsty during the entire film. Really!!! The cast was perfect. Who can go wrong with Ms. Redgrave? She didn't dissapoint! I have to go now. I need a glass of water just thinking about ""The Sad Cafe."""
2,Very dark,"Have tried twice to watch this DVD without success. It is so very dark and dismal! Not one to give up so easily, I will try again, perhaps when I am feeling blue myself."
3,the depression south had bitter fruit,"A midget hunchback, an old maid and her criminal husbandset in a backwater southern town where moon shine rulesis the setting for this play on the worst in man?I really doubt with the characters being so far from normal humans,the play has much appeal to wider audiences.I got to asking myself, who are these people?They had no radio and few picture shows or newspapers.There seems to be a real lack of any learning or social graces,but the ordinary people seem most gentle that there are few fightseven when they are drunk on white lightening.The ""Miss Amelia"" is the rich store keeper who alsomakes the moon shine by her father's recipe.When her cousin comes to live with her,the quiet of the small town is disturbedby the influence from outside. These people are dirt poorfarmers and mill workers, and a little entertainmentwith a social gathering at the cafebecomes the center of their life.When Amelia's rejected husband returns,the whole equation changes."
1,Do not waste your time and money!,Don't even think about it. This DVD is going directly into the trash!
2,Run Far Far Away,Like the other reviewer our TV also took a long time to warm up/tune to other channels. We have had our tv for around six months and the thing is starting to die on us. When we try to change the channel or switch inputs on it we get black snow or a rollin screen. We have to turn the tv off for several minutes and as of tonight it is starting to lose the channel while on one straight channel. Very frustrating. Of course since it's been six months since our purchase we have had to contact the manufacturer direct. Will be interested to see their response. ...
5,Good but don't overdose!,"I started taking these for minor ailments, which were prescribed by myself from personal research. I have to say that when I take multivitamins I feel better and this seperate C vitamin and bioflavonoids are great for pumping up the C/anti-oxidants in your diet. This particular vitamin/bioflavonoid combo is especially useful if you don't like to eat fruit. I started taking too many and felt weird so I cut back to only one a day. Various research has pointed to doses as high as 10,000 mg/day (that's 10 grams!!!)for certain treatments, which seems extreme. I was trying 3,000 mg/day (one at breakfast, lunch & dinner) but it proved too much too fast for my body. Start with one a day with your biggest meal and see how that works and if you want to take more then add another at a different meal and see how you feel the next day. I have no complaints about this vitamin and this manufacturer has a good reputation from what I have read."
4,starflyer rocks out,"Jason Martin can write these albums in his sleep. After the majestic pop release ""Old"" last year, Starflyer 59 returns with a bluesy rock masterpiece ""I am the Portguese blues"". This album was written around the time of their ""Americana"" album in 1997. The emphasis is on crunchy guitar hooks that build stellar songs like ""I need help"" and ""No revolution"". These songs really have a clean rock sound and that is good news for fans of Starflyer 59. With each album, Starflyer keeps getting better and ""I am the Portguese Blues"" is no exception. Why this band hasn't gotten the recognition they deserve is beyond me; oh yeah most people are clueless to good music even when it slaps them in the face."
4,Worth picking up.,"I picked up a used copy of this album not long ago and was surprised how much I dug it. I remember hearing a lot of negativity at the time it came out. I think all of that negativity was not justified. This release is not Starflyer's best overall album, but who cares? Taken on it's own terms it can be considered a minor classic. I would describe this as a good mix of Jason Martin's droning singing and songwriting style with some classic 70's influences.This album does take a few spins to digest... Overall a good addition to my Starflyer collection."
2,Not For the First Timer.......,"If you're new to SF59, this CD won't due any justice to their amazing back catalog....The Obsessives might want to get it, but won't be to impressed with its sound.I consider myself a pretty good SF59 Fan...I bought the CD and have only heard it about 3 times...it really doesn't leave much of an impression.. Sorry SF59...I'm sure the ""Real"" new album will be lots better....I can't wait for that one."
4,We are the blues,"This is a cool record from a cool group. It has that cool swagger that is in bands like Girls vs. Boys. Apparently Starflyer 59 has been around for over five years and have released many albums. Most of this album was written in 1998. The band went into a different direction on the second album. Now they are back to their roots. This is a guitar heavy, slow rock, record that combines indie rock sounds with love for music from the 1970s. ""Unlucky"" recalls the sound of T-Rex. ""Destiny"" is like an update of Blue Oyster Cult. Starflyer 59 might seem like a good band to play with Black Rebel Motorcycle Club. They probably are matched with some punk groups or heavy metal outfits. Hopefully good music gets out to the people."
1,"True disappointment. A complete change from ""Old""","It seems like anything you read about Starflyer59 goes to great length to tell you about how all of the fans of the early work were distraught when the Starflyer59 sound changed with ""The Fashion Focus"". They basically went from loud, noisy, crap to a much more mature sound. Why everyone thinks it is cool to say that they were into the early stuff, I will never understand. Anyway, now I know how they felt when the sound changed. If you liked ""Leave here a stranger"" or ""Old"", I highly doubt you will enjoy this album. In my opinion, it is unlisenable. I only pray that Jason will someday again release more good music and quit with the pseudo-hard rock dreck."
1,Songs about murdering children???,"I'm completely horrified by the song on this cd ""As I walked out one holiday"". The idea that a song about dragging a child off to a dark room where no one can hear him scream in order to stab him to death?? And then he's dragged down to the depths of hell?How in the world is this a cd for children? I'm glad I only borrowed it from the library and didn't pay money to hear these grating country twang hillbillies sing about such awful things.Please, do yourself a favor and DO NOT buy this cd!"
2,Why oh why,"Didn't I listen to the sample tracks?The singer might be to your taste, but not mine. Do yourself a favor and listen before you buy."
2,A little goes a long way,"As a fan of Pete Seeger's music, I bought this CD in the hope that the family connection would ensure similar quality of the music. Disappointingly, I've found this album really grates on me after a couple of songs. Peggy's vocal style in particular becomes mighty annoying to listen to over the length of the album, as her delivery can best be described as a neo-hillbilly twang. I may end up combining the best half-dozen songs from this album with some other folk albums to generate a listenable ""best-of"" set, but I'd find it unthinkable to listen to this entire set in one sitting. Only devoted fans of the genre or the duo should invest in this set; more casual fans of folk should direct their dollars to any of Pete's fine albums such as the Carnegie Hall classic."
2,"A little too ""folksy"" for us.","We don't care for this CD. We love Pete Seeger and Raffi, but this collection is one high-pitched, twangy song after another...like something you'd hear on a hillbilly's front porch. Frankly, we barely got through the first of the two CDs. We appreciate it for its heritage; and it is probably true to its original form, however, I'd be lying if I said we liked it."
3,La Guitarra Misteriosa- A Predictable Reader,"I read this book for my first year Spanish class. The ending was incredibly predictable, I knew what was going to happen and how it would end from chapter four (out of fifteen chapters). In the back, there was a handy dictionary of many vocabulary words used in the book, which made the reading smoother and easier. The five questions at the end of each chapter helped review the chapter's contents, which was nice. However, despite the dictionary, the story was just too predictable and boring."
4,Good Book for Experienced Test Takers,"Buy this book if you already have substantial experience with NT4 and Windows 2000 and you need help passing the MS tests. I passed the monster 70-240 with this book. The ""On the Exam"" tips were especially helpful. Also, the ""In the Real World"" comments were very entertaining."
4,"Good overview and review, but lots of errors","I already have my MCSE certification and am using this before I start interviewing to review all the information I learned in a 7-month class I recently completed. This is a great overview and review book! It definitely is nowhere near the only information you need to pass the Microsoft exams, but I don't think they're claiming that it is anyway. The only complaint I have is that it's full of errors! It looks like they took an older edition, maybe for Windows 98 or NT, and went through it changing parts that were new, only they forgot to make half the changes. But overall I'm very satisfied with it as an overview to jog my memory about a lot of things I'll need to know in technical interviews."
1,A major disappointment,"I am very disappointed with this book. Essential information is lacking, and too many details look like they were lifted from the older edition (which was excellent in my opinion). Better written and more comprehensive resources can be found online."
4,One problem....,"I really like her but her Animal Fur coat is really bugging me... the bratz are cool but with animal fur are they saying that killing animals for fashion is cool? And even if it is fake fur I am not really happy with it.So I bought her but *lost* the fur jacket (although I like the black rose, it adds a touch). She has light pink eyeshadow topped with camouflage green eyeshadow that goes about halfway up to her eyebrows, so at least it isn't too layered. She has a shear lipgloss which is gorgeous. Sadly, I lost her mesh skirt but oh well. It IS a mesh skirt, the top is real fabic though. And she has painted underwear *thank the lord*."
5,AWSOME. . .. . .. .. .,ive never seen such a pretty JADE DOLL IN MY LIFE!!!!!!!! I WANT HER AND CLOE. I THINK JADE IS THE BEST THOUGH. I REALLY LIKE HER SKIRT. CAN YOU SAY AWSOME???LEAH!!!! BRATZ FAN.
5,along the hammond innes genre.,"i very much enjoyed this novel dealing with an old mine, at a time when england had many problems. a truly great book!!"
4,A really nice gaming mousepad,"Like others in the gaming world I also have owned a ton of gaming mousepads. My favorite part of this is the light up blue logos and around the whole edge of the mousepad, which glows as well. To power the lighting system you need one free usb port and on the cable itself there is a control switch to adjust the brightness.Compared to my trustworthy old razer gaming mousepad the material on this one feels exactly the same, which is a good thing. My only complaint is I wish the mousepad surface was a bit bigger and that the usb cord to power the lighting was a braided cord. Other than that I have zero complaints, it works as you would want and need out of precision gaming pad"
5,Very slippery surface.,Very nice addition to anyone who has custom case lighting or wants something extra to accent there desktop. I like mine a a lot just beware it uses a usb slot to power the lights. Not a problem if you have the space but I was on my last plug slot. Anyway it is adjustable and you can turn the brightness down. I can recommend this product as of now. Not much else to say really. The thing looked just like the picture on this company's website. very true to life.
4,awesome way to light up your pc,Very satisfied with this mousepad. Blue light looks great and doesn't interfere with my gaming. Not sure if I completely like the plastic surface but it seems to be working well so far.
4,Nice led,"love it but led started to come and go dim whenever if feels like it after only 1 month of use of it. Must of got a diffective one, other than that really nice mouse pad for the price, and hey it's acrylic glass. Would buy again."
3,looks sweet but buyer beware,"This mouse pad is more of a novelty item and works fine for a while but in time the light dims out and eventually die out leaving you with a big black mouse pad with a cord. The USB cord has a dimmer roll switch to adjust the brightness level. I don't know if that is what gave out or if the internal lights themselves just gave out. Mine worked fine for about half a year and in that time, I must say I enjoyed using it. It had the sweetest brightest blue glow that matched my keyboard and tower lights. It was an excellent attention getter when gamer pals would come and play on the weekends. Another thing that I noticed with this mouse pad is, it is not compatible with some optical mice because of it's ""too"" smooth surface. The mouse optic light would refract and cause the pointer to suddenly shoot off screen. This is a very big problem when gaming online."
3,Somewhat Fragile,"Pros:-Great costumer service in replacing defective pad!-Looks 1337-Adjustable LED lightsCons:-The first one I ordered stopped working after the second time I plugged it in.-I dropped my second pad and the edge chipped.-Scratches slightly over time.-Plastic on the adjustable knob cracked-Another usb cord plugged into your computer.Bottom line: Cool because it lights up, but not very durable. I am modding mine to run off a battery instead of plugging it in."
1,won't work with my razer mamba.,"bought this because it looks cool,after set it up with my Razer Mamba mouse i found out my mouse won't work on that surface i had to tape the protective skin for my PS3 on it, then it works, i didn't try it with the other mouse, so be aware if you got the Razer mamba."
4,Worth adding to your movie collection...,"This movie actually suprised me. I wasn't expecting much, but it actually turned out to be really good, with a great story line. I orginally bought this just because I know one of the actors who has a minor part in the movie, but I am glad I bought it. It has a sort of suprise ending and it will keep you interested the whole time."
2,Disappointed,"Granted, I'm not that big of a fan of horror movies, I do like the occasional movie that will make you jump. This movie just wasn't that suspenseful or scary. Like 99% of the horror movies out there, this was very predictable and cliched."
2,Could have been better...,"Swank is such a talented actress, and her costar Idris Elba is equally talented. But their talent is wasted in this film. The script is pretty standard stuff, though the ending did have a decent twist. (however, if you pay attention you will catch on well before the climax). The scenery is beautiful, marred only by the plagues infesting this small town.AnnaSophia Robb, who play little Loren McConnell, is a lovely child, with very captivating eyes, but again she is wasted here.The movie isn't bad, but it falls prey to cliche's of this genre'. And that is another problem...it doesn't really fit into a specific mold. It isn't horror, not really suspense, not quite mystery....so it had the potential to be great, but it was one cliche after another.Too bad, because this isn't a type of movie we see often, and it was full of talented actors, but if you have a slow, rainy two hours you could certainly do worse."
3,About the river of red,"Well, it has been said in the other reviews. Yes, it's deriviative, little pieces sliced from The Exorcist and Rosemary's Baby, The Prophecy, et. al. But what movie in this vein (sorry, couldn't resist) isn't derivative? Is there anything new under the sun? On the whole, I found it entertaining, which is all I would ask for from such a genre. One little gripe: don't these ""scientists"" watch CSI? They should have been able to determine whether or not the river was blood just like Grissom would!"
1,Abysmal and predictable,"I suppose that if you're looking for cliches, predictable effects, and a pseudo-religious thrill, you could do worse. Stephen Hopkins (Predator 2, Executive Decision, and other pieces of dreck) is just right for this sort of thing. He, like Joel Schumacher, don't seem to care anything about originality or innovation, which rears its ugly head scene after scene in this flick. I fell asleep four times and am not sure what I missed."
1,"""The Reaping"" should have been called ""The Sleeping""...","because that was what I was doing after a few minutes of watching this Cardinal Sin being called a movie.If at confession you're given penance by your priest to do a thousand ""Our Fathers"" or to say the Rosary a hundred times, then count your blessings that he didn't force you to watch this movie just one time. Perhaps there truly is a place called Hell, because I felt like I was there for an hour and a half.This movie could have been so great, given the genesis of the story and staring Hilary Swank, one of the best actresses of our day, but it ended up being a complete mess. Even the quality of the blu-ray transfer was terrible.Please save your $19, or go buy ""Seven"" (which deals with this genera brilliantly), ""28 Days Later"", ""28 Weeks Later"", or ""The Skeleton Key"", which are all far superior films that you will enjoy time and time again.Happy movie watching :)"
2,LAME & BORING!,"Your time might be better spent engaged in an activity like catching up on the laundry or going out. The movie warns of ""disturbing images"", I found the only thing to be disturbing was that the creators actually found someone to finance such a B.S!!! C"
2,All mixed up and unworthy of Swank and Robb's talents,"This is quite a mish-mash. First there seems to be an evil young girl, played by AnnaSophia Robb, who is causing Biblical plagues in a small Louisiana parish. Then it appears that she is an angel and that everyone else in the town is worshipping Satan. She finally destroys them all--or God does; it's hard to say for sure. Then she implies to her rescuer, played by Hilary Swank, that the baby Swank is carrying is evil and the spawn of Satan...and that they both have to take care of the little devil. Huh?This movie just couldn't make up its mind. Is it supposed to be a story of faith or devil worship or what? You tell me.Swank and Robb have both done far better work than this."
2,The Reaping DVD,"I understood that this was a previously viewed DVD, but when I received it, it was clear that it was a copy of an original."
2,doesn't work with A2 player conflicts,bought this disk... hd dvd side locked my machine up contact toshiba upgraded my firmware with no help... toshiba says its the disk's fault..played fine on a A30 machine... I wouldn't buy any duel disk again ...
2,below expectations,Hilary swank is an extremly talented actress. Unfortunately her talens are not enough to save this one. Previews and posters looked great. but i fealt that the movie didn't deliver.
3,Good Horror - Bad Ending,"Yet another 4 star film that lost a star in the last minutes of the film. This one lost it in the last 15 seconds. Overall, still quality horror in the vein of Exorcist, The Omen, etc. Effects ranged from blah to excellent. I guess they spent the extra cash on the lightning, and couldn't afford a real-looking dead bull...oh well. This is still worth a watch. A rent, nothing more."
2,Standard pro-religious pandering,"Your standard ""non-believer shown the power of god neener-neener-neener"" story, likewise packed with religious pandering.The film attempts not one but two twist endings, neither one particularly plausible or impressive.I do like the imagery of a savage, vengeful god slaughtering the unbelievers though...simply because it's honest. That's the god of the bible, and I appreciate the accuracy of the depiction."
1,What a DUD !!!,"... despite the outstanding cast...though I can't understand casting the SUPERB Irish actor, David Morrissey, as an American!!!"
2,disappointing movie with an unrealized potential and a good cast,"The movie manages to build a pretty decent momentum till about a quarter way till the end of the film. At that point, it steers off into an insanely unrealistic, stupid plot that is less a scary thriller and more a big laughable blooper reel. Except that it isnt a blooper reel, it's actually part of the movie and is taking itself seriously (unfortunately for the view). It was nice to see AnnaSophia Robb (Because of Winn-Dixie, Bridge to Terabithia) in a movie role again - that girl has an incredibly bright cinematic future."
3,HILARY GETS PLAGUED,"THE REAPING is one of those disposable religious-based thrillers with the prestige of having a two-time Oscar winner in the leading role. Hilary Swank plays a professor who makes a career out of refuting so-called miracles by providing scientific support for any odd occurrences. We learn why she lost her faith and why she wants to debunk God's involvement. A science teacher from Haven, Louisiana approaches Swank when it appears that the ten plagues from Biblical lore may be occurring there and brought on by a strange little girl.Th3 effects are decent, but the movie never really achieves horrific proportions and the involvement of a Satanic cult seems a little farout. But it's an okay diversion."
3,Interesting movie,"This is another move based off some piece of Biblical scripture. It's not just one though, it's several mashed together, convenient parts picked out to suit the movie, which in itself is a bit odd and in my opinion, is a bit implausible, a tighter story would have made for a better movie."
4,intriguing,"If you understand the concept of the plagues from the bible you will find this plot interesting, well conceived and well acted."
3,Bound to annoy someone,"It's hard to do any sort of religiously themed movie without annoying believers or non-believers one way or the other (and leasing the other) as a various reviews illustrate.But as to the movie itself, it's okay as a horror film and I think the link to the biblical material works in that context. I did not find the twists at the end bad. Perhaps not amazingly sophisticated, but they held up okay. I'm not sure I'd watch this movie again and again, so I give it a 3-star rating: okay; not great."
4,I liked it!!,"I had forgotten all about this film until I saw its trailer on another movie. It was next on my list, and I'm glad I saw it.I think it fits in with the pyschological/thriller genre, instead of horror. I thought the acting was great, and the story made sense.This is one of those movies that you'll really like, or nor, not much in between.I loved Swank's character, and I would reccommend renting this and giving it a chance.I give it a B."
4,Hilary Swank shines in The Reaping!,"Stephen Hopkins directs The Reaping which is a very good supernatural thriller. Hillary Swank plays Katherine Winter who is an investigative scholar regarding paranormal events. She uncovers fraud and fake miracles. However, there are 10 biblical plagues that seem to occur in a very short period of time. The actors and special effects make The Reaping a movie that is worth seeing. There is a 20-minute stretch of non action that the director should have cut from the final version. On the bright side, Hilary Swank gives another talented performance.Plus, the ending is spectacular. I rate this movie with 4 stars."
2,Gave up after half an hour,The movie soundtrack is very noisy and disturbing. It remains quiet and then every few minutes it will just get loud. It has too many flashbacks flash forwards and dream sequences to keep track of. We had rented the movie on tivo via unbox but we deleted it in half an hour. Good that we rented with the 99 cent special deal otherwise this would have been a waste of 3-4 dollars and half an hour.
3,Recommended,"There is so many bad movies out there, but once in a while a good one popsI dont know who Hillary S. is so i did'nt care whowas acting, i just wanted to be entertained. The movie, the story, the creepy characters from Haven and the events kept the pace and even ifi kind of new what the problem was...it kept my interest till the end.Rocommended for a view or two."
2,Moses Reincarnated,"If you know all about Moses and the 10 plagues in the Bible, then you know what will happen next starting with the river turning red. It's so predictable that it's boring. In addition, there's no scare factor.Wanna know what the movie is about? Read the other reviews.Overall, don't waste your time with this movie."

2,It definately had potential?,"The Reaping, starring Hilary Swank was interesting for a variety of reasons. Of course there was nothing terribly original. The plot involved biblical plagues, a child believed to be responsible for the strange happenings being reported, strange deaths and a disbeliever. I, on the other hand, looked at it from the perspective of ""How would I react following a situation that rocked my spiritual beliefs to it's very foundation""? ""How would I view God or my spirituality following a tragedy that rocked me to my core""? Or ""How much can a person take before they break""?While the story revolves a Louisiana State University scientist who heads to the bayou to investigate reported biblical plagues. Water is turning to blood, frogs falling from the sky, lotus covering everything following the death of a young boy at the hands of his sister. As the story unravels, we find out that there is more to this small town that meets the eye."
1,Crap movie. And I like this genre!,"Hilary Swank is wasted in this silly movie that might have made an interesting X-Files episode, but even that would be a stretch. Even the effects are cheesy, as are the dialogue and plot. 1-star, mostly because Hilary looks good and tries hard to be better than the material."
1,"good premise, bad movie","this movie was a complete and utter disappointment. it could have been so good, but it was very very bad."
