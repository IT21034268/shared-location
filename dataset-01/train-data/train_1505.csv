5,Just From My View,"This song is sooo sad. It's a really good video, and I would reccomend buying the cd.The video, for some odd reason, alway's gives me a happy."
3,Three stars and no more,"Three words: One hit wonder. If it wasn't for all the WB hype, this song wouldn't get much airplay. Crawl is the only good song and rest are sugar pop. There's no originality. I liked the single, Crawl, but their other tunes don't match up."
3,price to high,I live in a small town and after I ordered this product I finally made it to a city and found that you could purchase like items for a lot cheaper at a store.
5,You don't have to be on a diet to LOVE this smoothie!!,"When I tried this smoothie, I was skeptical. How could it be this healthy and ALSO taste good? But I was pleasantly surprised... this smoothie tastes AMAZING!What's more, I actually was not suffering the usual hunger pains a few hours after having it. It's very satisfying!I'm a Weight Watcher follower and it's rare to ANYTHING this good and also healthy (and ONLY ONE POINT)!I have not tried the other flavors yet (but I will!). I can tell you right now that the Peaches and Cream smoothie is worth every penny."
5,Yummmmm!,The chocolate and the peach are my favorites. Strawberry is O.K. They are a great snack to have on the run. I keep them nice and cold so I can grab one and throw it into my gym bag for a nice healthy snack after a workout! My only complaint would be the price.
3,Am I the only one?,"I have to say, when I first tried these (Peach and Dutch Chocolate), I was amazed at such great taste, for so much fiber, protein and so few calories. I bought 4 cases! However, I soon noticed a weird affect. I started to experience gastro-intestinal discomfort about 20 minutes into my sipping (usually takes me about an hour to consume one, they are THAT thick). It's not a fun thing. Now, I am a vegetarian, and quite used to a high-fiber diet, so I don't know what this is a response to. Maybe because I drink them on an empty stomach? Well, I have 4 cases to figure it out. I still recommend this product, if you don't have this little side-effect. Definately try one or two before you invest."
5,NO BITTER AFTER-TASTE,THIS PRODUCT IS SIMPLY DELICIOUS! I USUALLY FIND PRE-MIXED SMOOTHIES TO HAVE A SLIGHT AFTER-TASTE---BUT NOT THIS ONE. IT IS A QUICK AND SATISFYING PICK-ME-UP WITH ITS OWN ATTACHED STRAW. TRY IT AND YOU WILL LIKE IT.
3,"LightFull Smoothie, Peaches & Cream","The smoothie was ok. Maybe it was the flavor. I'm a new mom, and was really busy during the day (while on maternity leave), it actually tied me over until dinner. But now that Im back to work, and sitting all day, I thought this would be good snack choice instead of going to the vending machines, but Im not feeling satisfied and find my self wanting something else. Again, maybe its the flavor. I love that fact that it has 6 grams of fiber. I'm going to try a different flavor."
3,Not too bad,"For what these are (low cal, high fibre for weight loss) they weren't bad. I personally wouldn't buy them again."
4,Sanfords have paid the price in life to write,I deeply appreciate the work of Transforming the inner man.The Sandfords have put their heart and soul into this writing and haveearned the right to write this book because of the long road they have traveled helping and ministering to others. Some have criticized this work but those same ones have not made the trip. The inner man is a life long journey of renewal and transformation. The Sandfords have helped us to better understand this divine process.
5,Healing waiting for you!,"This is the second copy of this book that I've purchased because the insights/scripture are so profound that I wanted to share. Believe me, this book on inner healing is worth the read. It helped me more than I can say and anyone who needs to understand the scriptures about God's healing and deliverance will not be dissapointed."
4,The Transformation of the Inner Man,"This used book was in excellent condition. We would have liked to receive it in less time, so next time we'll pay more for quicker delivery."
3,Intriguing Tale,"The Unveiled Mind of a Nurse is an honest, intriguing tale of a Honduran woman's battle and eventual triumph over debilitating manic depression. It is told by a woman who suffered physical and mental abuse, which does not discriminate against class or culture. Warren's book is an interesting glimpse into the life of a prominent island family and may be of interest to those who suffer from similar challenges."
4,Another great story,His stories are wonder light reading. Great for summer reading or anytime. I look forward to reading the next one.
4,A glimpse into what made Longmire into the man he is,"I only have one complaint about this book and that's that it was just too short on the flashback end. It felt like a teaser, a quick gloss-over, of a fantastic story. The modern day storyline was an interesting and sad one too. Human trafficking is a touchy issue that Mr. Johnson handled well. I love the characters in this series and can't wait to go back for more."
4,Liked it a lot.,"Liked the book, love the series. This installment gives you an insight into Longmire's character that has only been alluded to in the past. I don't enjoy the flashback literary tool but Johnson weaves it into his story very well. Sometimes the transitions seem abrupt but the story comes together. This was the first book in the series which I thought was wrapped up a little too neatly."
4,The best yet,"After a stumble on the last story, the author returns home and regains his pacing and style. A very well done tale, that gives us some back story on our hero, and ruminates on time and puzzles that remain with us.The author is working his way to the dependable and must-read ranking."
2,Too Bad,"I loved the first three Sheriff Longmire series but I think this one fell short. Too much in Vietnam and too much foreign language, the new charachters were slightly flat, and I am hoping that the next book will be more in the line of the first three. Disappointed."
2,Sequential Series,"The author's books seem to be sequential, so you'd better start with the first and work your way up to this one. This one had a confusing story line because it assumed reader knowledge about the book's characters. Flashbacks throughout and a required a suspension of disbelief had me racing to get to the end, the last two pages of which I didn't even bother with. Go with C.J. Box or Ridley Pearson instead."
4,Better Late than Never,"I enjoyed all of the earlier Walt Longmire mysteries, but hesitated a long time about reading this one because the reviews told of the Vietnam sections and I feared more violence than I could tolerate. But I finally gave in and read the book and am glad I did. It was a complex and enjoyable story and while the later Vietnam sections were scary, I managed to read through them.A plus for me was the absence of Dep. Vic Moretti throughout most of this book. Her profiency as a policewoman is admirable, but her foul language is a detriment. It prevents me from recommending these mysteries to my firends. An older woman, I belong to a large group of older women mystery readers that meets monthly to discuss a book we've all read. I think they'd enjoy these mysteries, but know they'd hoot me out of the group if I suggested a book with such a foul mouthed character. Maybe a future installment of the series will allow me to offer it for discussion. I'll await the next book and see."
1,This is supposed to HELP!!?????!!,"Hate to have to say this, but I've gotten better help in a game from the opposing pitcher. Not only did it not help, but it was hard to muddle through. Prima should hire good writers even if thy don't intend to put out good guides."
2,RE3 Strategy Guide,"This guide is some-what good, but compared to the other strategy guides that you can get, it is one of the worst choices. The maps are not as detailed as the ones from the VERSUS BOOKS strategy guide. The guide has spoilers in it and the way to read it can be greatly improved. It makes the game too easy. Many other stategy guides come with herb mixing charts and ammo mixing charts, but this one does'nt. The wepons and monsters index in other strategy guides are also some of the best."
2,Its a good book not ver good tho,This book isnt helpful theres no higly deatailed maps its a mess and it dosent have much solutions lik it dosent help u out with soultions at all
4,sounds good!,"Well I knew Michiel Koperdraat already, and he's absolutely a good bouzouki player.I love their music, they are good, but Michiel should take some singing lessons because it sounds like he has a cold the whole time. But anyway, I can recommend the cd, it is wonderful music to listen to, even if you're not familiar with Greek music."
4,Very good.,OK. Very nice product. It arrives on schedule and well package to protect agaist damage.My son is very happy with it.
2,Quality is very low.,"Got this for my son for Halloween. He tried it on and went outside and the pants ripped within a half hour. The pants were not too small/tight on him and they didn't get caught on anything. They just ripped while he was running around. My husband was there and saw what happened. Extremely disappointed. Not that I expected great quality, but I thought it would make it to Halloween. Not so much...."
3,"poor quality, but son loves it","This police officer costume was cute, but of very poor quality. The first time he tried it on, 2 buttons fell off. My mother-in-law ended up re-sewing every button on it before he even got to wear it for Halloween. Also, the hat was very poorly constructed. It had a hard plastic ring on the inside, and it was bent when it arrived. It never went back to the circular shape it should be. My 3 yr old did love dressing up, but I don't feel that this costume will last him more than a month or 2 before it totally falls apart. I would recommend buying a different one if you plan on using this for more than just Halloween."
3,Halloween,I got my order really fast! Costume was great my son is excited to wear it on halloween fits him great
1,DISSAPOINTED,"I am very dissapointed in this policeman costume because the costume looks very dirty as if it had been stored on the dusty shelf for many years and it has a stain at the shoulder AND came with a silver fish, a bag that eats clothes. I will rather go to the party city to get a halloween costume from next year because they have the same stuff. I don't even want to deal with re-packaging and ship it back therefore I will send this dirty, dusty costume to a cleaner and pay additional cost to make it use out of it."
2,okay costume,"fabric is cheap, hat came all distorted...jacket looks like a lab coat a pharmicist would wear..not like in the picture. overall gave it a 2/10. i really wish the hat wasnt all meshed up."
3,Uniform,"The actual clothing of this costume are great, but the hat has a hard band to fit around the head and it was crushed so that it can't even be worn straight, it's all lop sided. Shipping method definitely needs to be addressed."
3,"My daughter loves it, but...","This costume runs really big. And it started losing buttons during the first wearing. But my daughter really likes it, so I guess I will be sewing some buttons on and she will be rolling it up. The hat is really nice though."
5,Police Costume,My son absolutely loves his police costume! It's made out of very good quality fabric and the color is much richer in real life comparing to the picture. Excellent choice!
2,misrepresented,"This childrens police costume is misrepresented because it leads you to believe that the accessories come with it. They do not. My grandson was disappointed when he opened it, and the belt with all the police accessoreies were not there. In small print, it says sold separately. I had to order them seperately and pay another $10 for shipping."
3,strong fabric; weak seams and sewing,"I needed this as a costume for my 7 year daughter ASAP for performance. I ordered on a Saturday night and it came on the next Wednesday(regular shipping). I was glad I had read the reviews because the sizes run really big. The fabric is strong but the first time she tried it on the seam in pants split and a button fell off. I fixed the seam and secured all the buttons and they seems to be holding. She loves it but just be prepared to ""doctor"" up the sewing a bit.It does not come with any accessories(but the hat) and I was to cheap to order the extra's. The hat is pretty cool and I was glad that the shirt had a cloth badge sewn onto it. I used a regular black kids belt around the shirt to give the outfit the right look and that was enough to make it look fairly authenic (when worn with dark shoes) without having to buy the extra accessories."
2,Halloween Costume,"I bought the Police Office Costume for my son for Halloween. The costume was very durable. The badge that was on the costume did not look at all authentic, so I bought a separate badge and pinned it on over it. My other disappointment with the costume was the hat. I really had to work with it to make it somewhat resemble a police officer hat. It is soft, and not like a real hat. Plus the brim was made of vinyl and was bent during packaging. I DO NOT recommend the police belt that is sold separate from the costume. It is extremely cheaply made. The belt did not stay buckled so we had to tie a knot in it so he could keep it on. The packaging boasts a working flashlight which was a joke."
1,Ripped,My grandson didn't even get to wear this for halloween because it ripped really bad when he put it on.
2,too bad,I bought two of this costume one is for my son second is for my niece but the quality of this costume is soo poor. It is falling a part . The size is way too big. I had the take costumes to tailer and re sew them for kids size.It doesnt worth for even 5 bucks I think .But if you ask may son they love it because he loves been like police. I really want it to return it back but In am out of country and I had to pay twice much shipping
4,Nice costume..,"Very nice child's police costume. I would recommend you throw in a pair of handcuffs however. We found some at the dollar store, but they were about out of stock. One simple cheap pair of hand cuffs in this package would've finished it off and gave it a 5 star rating!"
4,Gruesome,"Deadly Detour is a bad movie, in terms of acting, script, direction, and pacing. However, it makes up for it all in over the top gore. The final half hour wallows in one gruesome death scene after another. There is even a massacre aboard a bus for the blind that is offensive and genius at the same time. Deadly Detour proves that all a slasher movie needs is a lot of decent gore to make it worth a watch. If you're a fan of Troma movies and the movies that Camp Motion Pictures have released, then Deadly Detour should be right up your alley."
1,Shockingly misleading,I bought this in the shop looking at the cover thinking it looks really good.. Little did I know there's a reason they didn't put pictures from the film on the back of the case.. It's incredibly pony. The picture is worse than a 1mp camera phone. The acting is ridiculous a fat man having sex and saying its better than peanut butter jelly!!! There's no story no real plot and I have wasted money on this rubbish. And the picture on the case of the goatman isn't even in the film it's just a scarred old hillbilly man
5,MRI Bible,"When I was training at the University of Pennsylvania this book was known as our ""Bible"". In short, it comprehensivly covers MRI from Atoms to Zipper artifacts. The book can be a little technical at times but unfortunatly, that's MRI for you. It does a great job at explaining the basic concepts of MRI and then building on those ideas to explain the more complex ones (K-Space headaches anyone?). A must for any technologist serious about passing their boards or reviewing MRI physics and implimentation."
1,a waste of an evening,"I was very disappointed in this book. I found the main character to be insipid, and her sister to be a set of stereotypes. It was a fast read, but I did not come out any wiser or happier for having read it."
1,Don't hate me if I didn't love it,"I read the book fairly quickly, it's that kind of a read. But it seemed like one of those movies that just fall away from you once you leave the theater. The people who like the book are praising it for being adorable, and maybe in a way it is that, but it is adorable, in this reader's opinion, in the same way a dog who you pass in the street is. You smile, you move on, it is forgotton. Now don't everyone go saying how I didn't get it. I just didn't like it, that's all."
3,average,"Okay, so I'm a bit surprised at some of the reviews here. To me, this book was about balancing relationships and finding work you enjoy. The two sisters both end up having experiences losing themselves in a relationship. They both grapple with what their work means to them - they both give their career up and either find a new one or rediscover their old one. Throughout the book the main character is pretty lazy but in the world of fiction of course ends up being successful. Go figure. Just what our society needs..more fictitious support of the illusion that you don't need to work hard to be successful. :o"
2,I can't get through the book...,"Wanted to like, really I did. I guess it's just not (no pun intended) my cup of coffee. To each her own, this one just didn't do it for me."
3,THE PERFECT BOOK....NOT!,"Here is just another book about a thirty-something woman who bithches about her job, legal assistant, her boyfriend, he won't commit, and her parents. The main character Liza Ferber goes on and on whinning about everything. For example, she wants her sister Bette to find someone then when she does Liza does not like anything about their relationshi or the amount of time Bette spends with her boyfriend.Do not get me wrong this book is not or bad. It does have its good points as well. This bok is easy to read, you will be able to finish it in one to two afternoons and finaly there are some funny monents. The hoildays dinners with Liza's family are good, but after awhile you just may wants to ring Liza's neck for all her complaining."
2,Grr...frustrating!,"Well hell. Here we have another 20 something novel that starts off all fun and funky and then drizzles out to a boring 100 page essay. I was really pumped when I began this book because it had some fun quirks. One sister spends all of her time working on a thesis about British comfort foods, whilst the other sister hops from job to job (a dog walker to a pool cleaner). Doesn't that sound like this book could have some excellent comedic appeal. Well it's all a facade because half way through the book just lost it's charm and I struggled to finish the hardback I had stupidly purchased. I say, read the first few sections then bravely set the book aside and write your own creative ending!"
5,a pleasure to read,this is the book for readers who enjoy thoroughly believable characters and story. I remember what it was like to be 32 and feeling aimless and restless in New York. Loved this book.
2,DUPED,I was with the book until the end. The entire thing gets wrapped up tightly in a neat bow and it suddenly just becomes ridiculous. The ending seemed such an easy way to end and it was just not what was really going to happen to this character. It dissappointed.
5,Libby Schmais Is Wonderfu!,Libby Schmais wrote a wonderful novel about two sisters. It is delightful for those who have lived life with a sister as a best friend but also for those of us who have never had a sister. Her writing is both humorous and flowing without there ever being a dull moment. This book is highly recommended to anyone who is looking for a reality story and not another non-realistic tale.
1,Don't Bother ...,This book came recommended after reading Sophie Kinsella books -- what a joke! Ptooey to The Perfect Elizabeth! Hated the characters and the story. Definitely don't buy it new if at all!
1,Goopey Just Like Marmalade,Ick. This book is sooo blah. I could only bring myself to finish it because it was short. This book is above all else- a few hours of your life that you will NEVER get back.
4,A good bathtub read...,"Okay, so it's not Tolstoy, and I haven't read Bridget Jones, but I suspect it can't be the end all girl book against which all other fluffy girl books should be measured. This is a fun read...I bought it because the spine looked interesting and I needed a gift for my sister-in-law. I started reading it while waiting for my guy to finish his dentist appointment and decided, very quickly, that I needed to read this book. So I had to go buy other books for my sister-in-law, my guy thought, since my name is Elizabeth, that this wouldn't be the best gift for me to give...but I digress. I bought the book at 3:21 p.m. yesterday . I finished the book last night before midnight. Mind you, I took a few hours off from reading to eat and the like. So, obviously, not a book you'll have to wade through, but sometimes that's exactly the kind of book one needs: easy to read, short, light, but not too light...a good bathtub read. Girls, pour a glass of wine and get your bubbles ready!"
3,A contemporary fiction novel,"This is a book about two sisters named Liza and Bette. They are both quirky and interesting. I prefer Bette, probably because Liza reminds me too much of myself - very nuerotic and pessimistic; she over anyalzes everything.The books highlights are the relationship between the sisters, any passages about the parents, and Bette's pregnancy. At times it could be boring."
2,"Boring, Boring, and more Boring!!!","Where is the plot? I asked myself this question as I read this dreadfully boring book. The reviews claimed this book was funny. I read nothing funny, only dull dialogue that put me to sleep. This is not a good book. It does not compare to Briget Jones. ... I was greatly disappointed."
3,"A good start,but falls down hill afterward","I really did enjoy this book even though I realize it need some help. I read a lot of the other reviews and something did happen about half way through that really seem to mess up the story. Although I don't believe a book has to be a challenge to be good. I personally don't want every novel I read to be a challenge I would rather it be comfortable and call ""come pick me up and enjoy"""
2,for ages 7 - 11,I blame myself - it seemed marketed towards me - gen x - and I'm a coffee fan - but I paid the hardcover price and can't force myself through it.
5,Funny and poignant story of two sisters!,"I loved this book. To me, it was about a young woman's search for happiness in modern day new york. Liza is a very sympathetic character and I enjoyed the whole quirky cast of characters -- her dance teacher, the lemmings, the matchmaker and her ex-commie parents."
4,A good sampler,"If you're unfamiliar with the who's who in melodic metal nowadays, you owe it to yourself to pick up one or two of these Metal Dreams CDs, courtesy of Nuclear Blast, the best metal label on the planet. Vol. 1 features 17 metal ballads, branching into the genres of neo-classical power metal (Hammerfall, Stratovarius, Sinner), symphonic gothic metal (Therion, Amorphis) and melodic death metal (Hypocrisy, Dismal Euphony). Personal favorite cuts come from Primal Fear, Love Like Blood, Therion, Lacrimosa and Hypocrisy. Crematory's ""Tale"" is probably my overall favorite, with its beautiful keyboard intro and soaring vocals. A few weak tracks prevent this compilation from besting its successor, Metal Dreams Vol. 2, and I think it could have included a few songs from Nightwish or the Gathering. All in all, a very solid effort from Nuclear Blast. I also highly recommend Vol. 2, which is significantly better."
3,Problems with Fan,"Used Silverstone ST60F to build Media PC. Selected unit due to being advertised as ""quiet"" and modular design.Was ""Quiet"" for 2 months until fan became very noisy. At first I thought it was a bad bearing in the fan but finally determined that the fan was vibrating against enclosure. Noise dampening material was placed between fan and enclosure which fixed the problem.Now the ST60F has a small piece of plastic stuck in one of the air coils which is vibrating at high frequency when energized. For the premium price of this unit, a buyer should not have to deal with these issues. On a positive note, the modular design is great."
2,YAMAHA,"YAMAHA(it's a japanese company) makes many products, for example, ICs, pianos, keyboards, audio products.The YAMAHA's best audio product is NS-1000M, a book-shelf speaker.NS-1000M is the best speaker made in Japan in the history.Unfortunately, NS-1000M is not sold now.And more unfortunately, YAMAHA now has become a trivial maker.NS-333 is only one of low cost speakers. orz"
2,X-Box Games from 2003 are BAD,"This Xbox Live enabled title will begin turning double plays, throwing brush back pitches and clearing the fences for the 2003 Major League Baseball season. But this is the worst X-Box game... sort of."
5,This is awesome,"This has the best graphics I have ever seen. The game has flawless gameplay, about 40 batting stances, and the player faces look like they do in real life. It has all the usual options, and you can unlockk stadiums. You also can earn points for a created player by trying to do baseball rare games that have actually happened. The best in-game analysis ever!"
3,Keep looking...I know I will be,"It's not too bad of a game, but I've played better. A couple of cons that come to mind are:1. You can't manually pinpoint where you want your pitch to go. Instead, you aim at a quadrant and then decide whether or not you want it to be a ball or a strike. It's far more fun to try to paint the corner by yourself.2. You can switch out pitchers, but you can't make any other types of substitutions. Unless I've missed something, you can't put in a pinch hitter, or change out defensive position players."
1,Not even close.,Don't waste your money. WSB is the best baseball game on the Xbox. All the other baseballs game are also pretty much better than IP also. Check gamerankings.com
2,Pasty,Love Laura's stuff but this one makes me look pasty and balance did not see it. I will stay with the bronze and brighten.
4,Laura Geller -Balance & Brighten,"I was always a mineral's girl. But this is pretty good too! And it cuts down on ""getting ready time"" in the A.M. I'm all for anything that saves me time and does a good job too. I will keep using this."
1,Disappointed,"I had very high hopes for this product, as I usually love all of Laura Geller's cosmetics, however this one just didn't work for me. I found it had way too much sparkle in it for my taste. It didn't look natural and I felt like I looked like I had a bad tanning session. Wanted to love it, but DIDN'T"
3,not for reference,"This was recommended by Diana Waring in her History Alive curriculum, but it is totally redundant when used along with her great comprehensive material. I had the impression it was a reference guide to get a foundation about the ""famous men""but it has a brief intro about the person, then you have to do the research to find out about them elsewhere. It gives you vocab and ""people and places"" lists, and some questions. That's it. Not what I expected. Maybe I didn't research it enough before buying."
3,Human Disease Review,"I want to comment on the great customer service I rec'd along with the last minute shipping needs that I needed in time for the start of school. The only disappointment I have is I did not receive the correct CD with the book and some of the end of the chapters review test/skills pages were torn out of the book. Luckily, I had a teacher that reference the book sometimes but went by her PowerPoints....."
3,Fair,"Not the easiest book to read in the world. It puts me to sleep. If it was not a required textbook, I would not be reading it!"
2,for entry level healthcare staff only,This book was way too elementary for anyone beyond basic healthcare worker level. As an RN I would not recommend it... it was probably too basic for me as a medical assistant.
4,human diseases,The book arrived on time and was very good I'm glad I bought new.The workbook that goes with this book was so late I had to return it. I was disappointed with that so order extra extra early.
4,disapointed,"I was very disapointed, when I discoverewd that the micrisoft office I bought did not have outlook included, which was the one program that I really needed.there was notrhing in the description of this disk, that indicated that there was no outlook.i was under the impresion that microsoft office, always inclyded outlokk, as part of the offering.a lesson learned, do not assume, ask questions.signed, a disapointed buyer.1/7/08."
4,An intelligent thriller about real people,"I enjoyed this book immensely! It was gripping and engaging -- a good, fast, fun read. I especially liked that the characters were real people with real problems and real personalities. The story has a romance, but there are no heaving bosoms, and the main character has more to her life -- enough so that the romance is a part of the story, but the story doesn't deteriorate into a romance novel."
5,the guilty pleasure,"For 2 years I have been sharing TPB vignettes with friends from youtube. I won't loan out my dvds of this series because they are too funny and I'm afraid they wouldn't be returned. I had bought the previous box set which included all 7 seasons and the Christmas special in an insulated collapsible lunch tote and a sleeve resembling a beaten down trailer from the park. With the cheeseburger locker edition, you get all 7 seasons, Christmas special, both motion pictures and the 90 min series final. The topper is the packaging... which resembles Randy's gut. Take off sick for 3 days and watch all the discs and the bonus features and become as hooked as I am! And the price for this new collection is well worth it! The only thing which would've made it better would have been a Conky doll to go with it."
5,AWESOME IF AMAZON WOULD SEND IT,tried pre-ordering from amazon.ca. on releae day (June 16) it went on indefinite out of stock. cancelled. tried pre-ordering from amazon.com. got an expected delivery date of july 2nd. on release day (June 30) status got changed to 10 to 12 days. expected deliver date changed to july 15. DOES AMAZON HAVE THIS IN STOCK OR NOT??!! RIDICULOUS!! Recommend buying it somewhere more reliable. the set itself is awesome.
5,Funny as Hell!,Couldn't ask for a better gift to myself for the Holidays! Hilarious!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Those Canadians know how to do comedy!!!! Gotta love Bubbles!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,FUNNIEST TV SHOW EVER!,"THIS SHOW RIGHT HERE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IS BY FAR THE FUNNIEST TELEVISION PRODUCTION I HAVE EVER WITNESSED. NOW IT MIGHT BE BECAUSE IM A 40 YEAR OLD WHITE MALE THAT LIVES IN A TRAILER DOWN THE WAY FROM MY POP,LIKES TO ENJOY A LITTLE SMOKE AND DRINK NOW AND THEN, AND CUSSES LIKE A TRUCK DRIVER(WHICH I WAS FOR 15 YRS.),BUT STILL I THINK MY COMEDY SENSE IS PRETTY KEEN AND THIS SHOW HAS IT. WATCH HOW INEPT AND UNEDUCATED THESE ACTORS PORTRAY THEIR ROLES AND LISTEN CLOSELY BECAUSE THE REAL COMEDY IS SOMETIMES HARD TO SEE,THE INUENDO AND SUCH...ANYWAY I LOVE IT AND GIVE IT 5 OUT OF 5."
5,Best investment ever!,Best Tv series ever made.... And thats all there is to it. Plus it comes with a lunch box stash bag.
4,"Love the boys, but this set lacks.","One glance at the raves this show gets tells the story of its quality and popularity. More Americans are discovering Trailer Park Boys, through sets like this one. And the AV quality is just fine, too. But the price is really outrageous for a set that doesn't even include the pilot. Go for the Cheeseburger Locker edition instead and have a great time with this awesome comedy saga!Fifty Shades of Trailer Park Boys: TPB in the Great Comedic Traditions"
5,trailer park boys complete seven seasons dvds,"i love the tpbs. can't get enough. the only negative review i have is that in a couple of the dvds special features, there was no sound for about ninety seconds. other than that, they were perfect. seven seasons is just not enough!!!!!! julian is so hot. and ricky is adorable. bubbles is just extraordinary and the rest of the cast is awesome."
5,The best of Canadian tv.,"I thought this show was a little off at first, but it doesn't take long to get sucked in. The eps are all hilarious, and you are always wondering how much worse it can get. Being aired on a Canadian network makes it even better with their views on censorship being more on par with Europe, and less with America. Great buy!"
5,Freaking hilarious,"If you a real Trailer Park Boys fan you won't think twice about buying the Cheeseburger Locker. 1.21 Gigaguts worth of Canadian trailer park dope-smoking, drunk insanity. All that said, it's a pretty good deal and a great way to get all the movies included. Looks awesome on your DVD shelf, too."
5,Great Gift,I bought this for my boyfriend last year and he was very happy with it! Funny show and great packaging.
5,This is a gift,this product is a Xmas gift or my family ib TX. who LOVE the show. Your service was great and I will definitly order from you again.Marianne Kerby
5,Well worth the money!!,"When my old big screen decided to die, I decided I wanted to go with the full movie theatre experience. After about 2 months of research I decided upon the Sanyo Z4 and what a great purchase it was. I have the projector roughly 14 ft from the 121"" HC Screen. The image quality is fantastic using the HDMI connection. I have it hooked up to the DishHD and a upconverting Sony dvd player. If you search around you can find great prices on HDMI cables that aren't the ridiculous price monster ones."
1,do NOT buy this piece of junk,"Stay away from this product. The 'towel' is extremely small, even for a kid. It's very thin, can not hold any water. The quality is extremely poor. In some places you can almost see through this so called beach towel. I can't believe the seller advertises and sells a product in such bad condition. Stay away from this item, and from this seller for that matter, or you will have to pay the return shipment on your own account and waste your time!"
2,Pirate Towel,"Great graphic on the towel, however, towel size is a bit on the smaller size. Let's face it, we've all gotten used to the plus thick towels that are now super cheap because they are made in China and this towel just isn't up to standard regarding thickness and absorption... Love the graphic but the towel doesn't absorb much if any water because it is paper thin."
3,A shrinking Pirate Towel!,"Disappointed because the towels are very small, like for a child. It also sheds something awful, even after washing it twice!"
2,not all that,"I have the Bailando single from Loona and Paradisio. The Paradisio version is much more intense . . . one can determine the feeling and passion in the singer's voice, which often sounds provocative. The Loona version lacks intensity in the vocals and seems quite bland. I would much rather prefer hearing the Paradisio version if I were in a dance club."
1,A shameless copy!,"It's kinda shame that Loona covered this song just a year after the group ""Paradisio"" did this song. And Paradisio were much better!"
4,Pros Outweigh the Cons,"I've had mine for 2 weeks. I didn't buy mine from Amazon; I paid about the same amount for it at the Sprint store. The Sprint store had a gizmo that transferred my entire contact list from my old phone to this new phone in a split second.What I like about this phone...* It came with one month of free Internet, but I will have to cancel it at the end of the month.* The colors are great!* And I was able to download my own ringtone, an MP3 file. Though it wasn't easy to set up the MP3 as the ringer.* It comes with a smart card which is easy to use to transfer information to/from the phone from the computer. My laptop has a media card slot which made using the smart card very straightforward.What I don't like...* The directional buttons are kind of small. With a Bandaid on my finger I had trouble hitting the keys."
4,"Great, functional, affordable fun, but.....","The Samsung M500 phone is an amazing phone. The only bad thing about it is that the outside scratches VERY easily. The VERY first day I got my phone I put it in the side pocket of my purse and at the end of the day, it had three obvious scratches on it. I hadn't dropped it or done anything that I think would cause it to scratch, so, needless to say, I definitely suggest getting a cover or case for the phone.I would suggest getting the silver phone because maybe the outside paint won't show scratches as much."
1,Won't last in my office...because I threw them away.,"I love good wasabi peanuts. This ain't them.The biggest problem with Emerald's take is that the medium used for the wasabi coverage is soy sauce and not a very decent one. The nuts don't have much characteristic wasabi 'bite' to them - they're very pallid in that regard. But far more important: there's a bitter soy sauce flavor overriding everything; instead of the purity of peanut and wasabi, there's a muddled yet very unpleasant tang of flavors which do not mesh well at all. Do yourself a favor and pass on Emerald. I wish I had..."
2,Discharges quicker than stock battery.,"On the plus side this battery is cheap and works in my camera, but unfortunately discharges noticeably faster than the stock battery."
1,Not a workable replacement,"This replacement battery does not hold a charge very long and the camera drained the battery very quickly. Only works long enough to get the real Olympus Battery charged, but if you don't have a charger ready, you'll be disappointed."
1,Junk,"This battery lasted about a week, and then stopped taking a charge. I should've gone with a brand name."
5,Recvd item very quickly - great seller,I was a little surprised how fast I received the battery I ordered. It was great. The price was incredible as well. I would buy again should the need arise.
1,"Hill's Science Diet, etc.","I love Hill's Science Diet Adult, etc., but I hate the way you market it. It comes in cases of 24 cans, but can only be delivered every 30 days! What are my cats supposed to eat the other 6 days? I would love to have ti delivered to my doorstep, but had to opt out because of the time discreptancy."
1,Didn't stick in my wall,The product is very nice and came in excellent conditions. My only star is that it didn't get stuck in my wall... so I had to return it...
5,awesome,awesome product will be ordering again for sure. the product was new and in great package . like how fast service was brought to me
3,playing card holders,It held the cards well and it stood up by itself. Works great for children or for those with Arthritis/
3,Triangle Card Holder,Plastic card holder is okay for up to 15 cards. The spring does become weak over time and will not keep cards together.
3,cardholder,"handy but awkward pulling card out when playing. Have to hold the plastic where the cards are, then tug out the card you want. If not, your cards will spill out."
2,Not worth the trouble..,Seemed like a great idea...however the quality is low and they do not securely hold the cards- so the cards continue to fall out of holder- not worth the trouble
5,Saved my hands.,"We play a card game where you can be holding up to 15 or more cards in your hands. These card holders are life savers. I have some arthritis in my fingers and these holders really work. They are worth every dime. The price is right (4 holders for $4.99), because in most places they sell for $4.99 per holder."
1,poor quality,"These card holders are of poor quality - they work for about 1 round of cards. After that, the spring inside is worn out and the cards will fall out."
3,Okay,"I haven't used these yet, but they seem to be very nice and a good size for small hands to hold."
5,My favorite 4Him CD yet,"I have several 4Him CDs. They are my favorite Christian group. This is by far their best work yet. It opens with solid harmonies on ""Fill the Earth"". That is followed by ""You Reign"", which makes me raise my hands to Jesus every time I hear it. The title cut, ""Visible"", shows us how we need to emulate Jesus in everything we do. ""The Promise"" reminds us that Jesus is everywhere and we may be looking in the wrong place. We need to just open our hearts and he is there. I truly love all the songs on this CD. Buy it now and you will too."
1,I was not impressed.,"First off, one caveat: I bought this unit ""Denon Factory Refurbished"" (NOT from Amazon). It never worked properly. All I can say is NEVERRRRRR buy anything refurbished. This is the second time I have done so and BOTH times the units have not worked. Also, beware on this unit if you do buy it. It is shipped with two shipping screws on the underside that MUST be removed BEFORE you try to use the unit."
2,"The whole album is poorly produced...except,","except ""How Great Thou Art"" - a classic SLOW hymn brilliantly arranged to Modern Rock feel. I love the new arrangement of this song.. However, the rest of the album is hard to hear again once you played it the first time. It sounds way too studio friendly and it definitely, DEFINITELY lacks energy and drive. There are some nice originals on this album as well, however they are too soft for me and in the end each song lacks its own identiy, if you will.I bought this album because I actually went to Saddleback Church in California recently, and I liked their music. However, i am sad to report that I am rather disappointed with their ""first"" (is it first?)project. I feel they should have done a live cut of their worship service rather than a dry, stiff and ..unenergized studio album to have their music heard.For those of you looking for better ""worship"" CDs, check out:Israel Houghton ""Another Level""And that's my 2 cent."
5,time saver,"Had this tool for sometime now, best sander I have ever used. You have to get use to this sander. I suggest you start off at around speed number 3 then once you have went over your dry walled area, re-sand on speed number one. This will take any swirl marks out and give you a nice finished wall with no effort at all.Like any tool... you have to get use to it, once you do, very good sander.Mark."
2,Well I tried it and I still have mixed feelings about it!,"I still don't know what to think about this sander. I tried it several times and here are my thoughts. If you are doing the job from start to finish this sander will get heavy after about 10 minutes. It weighs too much, especially if you are doing a ceiling. I like the idea but it's an expensive piece of equipment. I felt as though I had to push down on the unit to get it to sand. This is where it starts to get heavy. I think I'm going to try the Fiba-Tape dustless pole sander next. As for my Porter Cable 7800, well eBay it is.Update: I tried the Wilco Dustless pole sander and I think it's a better alternative."
3,Porter-Cable Model 7800 Drywall Sander,"For the money that was paided for this item, It should have come with an operation demo video. The instruction manual needs more help."
1,Unsatisfied,According to the single review when I purchased this product it was rated 4 stars. I have sanded drywall in many different ways and thought according to the 4 star rating this tool would be worth a try. Well I spent more time repairing marks left by the sanding disk than I got sanded. I tried different speeds and sanding disk with no better luck. I am very perticulant about my work and in no way will this machine perform to my standards. It is my experiance that the previous 4 star rating far exceeds the performance and results I got.
2,surprised,I have been doing drywall for 24 years and have owned several porter cable sanders this one doesnt have the same power as the previous and i am disappointed in its performance if i could return it I would
3,pro,"Great product, works great cuts down a lot of time and dust when hooked to any shop vac with a bag. Downfall the drive shaft and rubber casing WILL break, one year warranty and waiting time or about $90 bucks with the chevron sri grease you have to use on the drive shaft, from chevron web site. Good luck and let the machine do the work, dont use to much pressure like my help does."
4,Take Your Time!,"I purchased this tool because I had a drywall contractor repair and plaster my 1940's style home. The contractor did a horrable job, thus I purchased this tool because of the large volume of sanding. After a few lessions on pressure and speed I got the hang of it. TAKE YOUR TIME - GO SLOW when using this product and the results are great. The dust collection is good. Overall, I like this tool very much."
5,quality,I recently bought a new sander replacing the one i bought 7 years ago. It is a great tool and i cant live without one. The quality of the product has been second to none and i am well satisfied with it. That said however over the last couple years i as a general contractor have experienced a severe decline in the quality of tools and material. Quality control evidently has been done away with. Ive used the new sander once and apparently the wiring inside the handle is defective because in order to get the damn thing running you have to tap the handle on something solid. Havent taken it apart yet. Im hoping it is minor and i can fix it. I hope this one lasts 7 years. At this point i doubt it. Thanks.
3,hardcore heaven,"i don't even like hardcore but i had to get this album just because of the number of ""stars"" on it. the vod song is awesome. moby pulls off something special with the drum loop filled ""sailin on"" and snapcase rock as usualy. i have to say the cave in song, with it's haunting melodies and 8 minutes worth of guitar effects and distortion was a pleasant surprise as well. the rest of the album is pretty much bad brain songs at their hardcore best. hardcore fans need to get this album as soon as possible."
1,...maybe if you like crap,"wow, what a terrible aweful steaming pile of crap. if you want to slow down the bad brains and take away any raw energy that made you like them, then go for it. a collection of bands that are more ruining the original than paying tribute to the band's work. if you don't like the bad brains, but like the crappy bands doing these ruinations, then hurry and buy this gem."
5,A thorough description of Gaudi's design methods.,"If you are reading this, you are either an architect, an aficionado of architecture, or you are fascinated by Gaudi. Sure you already know that Gaudi used hanging weights and strings to design his structures. But did you ever notice that of each set of towers of the transept, two are closer together than the other two? Do you know what a hyperbolic parabaloid is? Have you ever seen computer drawn cross sections of the columns of the nave? Did you know that the column surfaces are made of interfering geometric shapes? Mr. Burry, an architect on the Sagrada Familia staff, describes this, the history behind the construction, and more about this magnificent church-to-be. The book includes sections with detailed photographs and drawings of the nave and the two facades of the transept."
5,Iran Contradictions,"Iran Contradictions is one of the best international intrigue books I have read. I rank it right up there with the early Robert Ludlum books. Jim Scott is a talent a cut above authors such as James Patterson or Len Deighton. The plot was carried brilliantly by the lead character, Ed Holloway, running into and out of trouble following the arms deal. Jim's writing style is intelligent, his use of words succinct and piercing, cleverly intertwining history with fictional characters. I recommend this book exciting book to any avid reader of international intrigue."
3,missing parts,this did not come with the roller fairlead like it was supposed to. the ad stated it was included but it came without it. pretty dissappointing.
4,The best thing in this whole series is Methos (P. Wingfield),"Although the whole ensemble meshes together beautifully, Peter Wingfield out-acts the rest, and brings to Methos a wonderful, edgy yet vulnerable feeling. The chemistry between him and MacLeod jumps right out at you. Joe Dawson rounds out the triad very nicely."
5,Tears and laughter,"This book really got to me. I had an abortion at age 16 and I relived it all, I laughed and cried and thought about the choices I made. A book like this one is good because it isn't an angry abortion book but is about real people and real life feelings. I am 24 now and have gone on with my life, making better choices I hope! But I will always remember the characters in this book."
5,Touching...heartfelt...tearjerker....splendid..,"I enjoyed this well written, thought provoking, novel. The characters felt real..someone we know..maybe ourselves.I have been in the position to have to CHOOSE and the decision was the right one for me. Abigail Reed did a wonderful job in developing these characters and the events that developed from the choices they made...it renewed my spirit of forgiveness and true love...that is rarily shown with such open honesty as in this novel. Thank you Abigail Reed for your contribution."
5,Review from a CAD Coordinator,I reviewed this book for a possible use in my class during this semester. I am more than satisfied that this is the right book for my class. I will be covering basic and some advanced commands in SolidWorks 2005 and all of them are explained in detail in this book. There are some additional topics in this textbook that would be more useful for the industry professionals. I hope to have a great semester teaching SolidWorks 2005 with this book and the teaching resources that come free with this book.
5,A well explained textbook a begginer on this software can choose,The step by step procedure involved in writing this textbook interestingly guides the user into the usage of tools and commands. The format and method adopted for writing this textbook is simple and easy to understand. This holds good for the beginers. This textbook can also be used as a reference guide for the basic tools that are discussed from the software.
1,Not what I spected,"The autocad book of this author was great, and that was the reason I purchase the solid work one , but I am disappointed because I don't learn anything o this book."
4,After reading 2 chapters,"I have been a solidworks user for over a year. In just reading the first 2 chapters I picked up tips that were never taught in classes and helped improve my speed. I will review this again after I am further along.The only drawback to this book so far is the annoying misspellings, and very WRONG use of English sentence structure- which makes yor mind hit a brick wall every time you catch one. I wonder who the editor was?"
5,Can't be better for this price range!,"This model competes with more expensive high end turntables. It's a direct drive unit but there is no mechanical noise, and you can be sure of the speed control always. The capability of interexchange headshells keeps simple the process when you want to try different cartridges. Overall excellent sound and keep direct drives units alive on the turntables market."
1,"Boring, nothing new.","This book was so predictable and boring I didn't even get half-way through before I returned it to the library. I'm disappointed in Ms. Krentz's lack of originality and depth in her last few books. The plot is essentially the same as most of her others. Same hero and heroine, different names. Same villians, same lifestyles..."
2,Flash was a little disappointing following Sharp Edges.,"I have read and re-read all of Jayne Ann Krentz books. I love all of her work as Castle and Quick as well. Usually after I read one of her works, I have a good feeling. This book left me with no feeling at all except for disappointment. I can see where several of the characters are made up of character from other books with minor alterations, but they have no depth to them. I will continue to read her books, but I will not be re-reading this one."
2,Thank goodness for the library,"Just when I thought things couldn't get any worse, another of my favorite romance authors moves further into the realm of ""mainstream"" fiction. Jasper and Olivia (our hero and heroine) meet and set off sparks, then are caught up in a confusing and ultimately unsatisfying blackmail plot (I mean, how easy is it to have the bad guy shouting the answers to all of the questions before he's even taken out of the picture?). I was very disappointed in this book, and I am grateful that the public library saved me the $24."
2,This book was not up to Ms. Krentz's standards.,"I have read all of Amanda Quick, Jayne Castle, and Jayne Ann Krentz and I believe this is the least satisfying book she has written since the beginning of her career. The story is formulaic, the characters one-dimensional, and Ms. Krentz's trademark sensuality is, for all intents and purposes, missing. I hope this is not going to be typical of her future work."
3,Lacklustre,"Jayne Ann Krentz seems definitely on the path of Mainsteam Women Fiction. The romance in her latest is very very ultra-lite. I have no idea what the main characters look like at all!The wit, the humour, and the suspense are there, but everything seems so fimiliar after a while. And the suspense isn't even strong to begin with, hence my interest begins to wane after a while.And for $7.99, this book isn't worth the price."
1,A big disappointment from one of Jayne's biggest fans.,"Took me a week to read Flash. I usually read her books in one/two days - I can't put them down. The sensual side of the relationship was missing (basically a fade out). Her main characters did not set off sparks. After reading a Krentz/Quick/Castle book, I usually want to re-read it immediately but not this one. She is going toward main stream books instead of her romances (what a lose for romance readers). Hope Jayne reads her reviews."
3,Disappointed with FLASH,"I have been a Jayne Ann Krentz fan for many years and have always enjoyed her Northwest U.S. locales the chemistry she creates between her main characters. However,FLASH was somewhat of a disappointment in one way - I figured out ""who done it"" very early in the book (and I usually do not). To me, that spoils some of the enjoyment. However, the book is still worth the read, but it will not be on my list of favorite Krentz books."
5,Excellent,"This a perfect thriller for our times about stocks and corporations, considering the stock market fever that has recently infected our country...and if you took a hit during the recent stock market crumble, you'll be able to relate to the anxiety the fight for company stock creates in this book! It's a page-turner as good as Craig Furnas's THE SHAPE, or Michael Crichton's DISCLOSURE, and to be highly recommended."
3,"Same old, same old","If you are new to Jayne Ann's work, then you will undoubtedly love this book. She writes well and does great characters. But I must admit that I used to read her books in one sitting and this one took me three days. It seemed like just about every part of the novel was recycled from one of her others. As I read it, I kept thinking about ""Hidden Talents"", another of her books that involved blackmail. It was more complex, funnier, and had much better supporting characters.I hate to say it, but I'm getting tired of the fact that her main characters are always business people. Even in her historicals everybody is a business person. How about trying something new and different, Jayne Ann?"
2,Either you love her or you don't,"JAK writes the same characters in every book. I have read at least one I liked (Deep Waters), but in general she is not an author I appreciate."
3,Not the best for Krentz - and not a keeper in my library!,"For the record, I am a Jayne Ann Krentz fan, and love her Amanda Quick books as well. But FLASH was kind of boring for me. One of the reasons I love Krentz novels is the witty and funny conversations with her characters, however, her usual humour is missing here. The ""mystery"" blackmailer gets wrapped up too quickly, and seemingly ""behind the scenes"". It is never really explained how Sloan determines that Dixon was after him on the island, and sent by Eleanor no less. If you're looking for something better by Krentz, pick up Trust Me, or Absolutely, Positively, or even Deep Waters. They meet the ""keeper"" requirements! I hope the upcoming Eye of the Beholder is better, or I may have to leave Krentz off of my ""must have - will keep it in my library"" list."
1,"silly, silly book",This is such a silly book it boggles my mind how it got printed. I'm glad a friend loaned me the book and I didn't pay for it. She's sorry she bought it too. Annette Kelly
3,Intriguing Approach,"Inheritance the blackmail brings together two entrepreneurs, Olivia and Sloan. The friction between them smooths out when they see that their existence and the survival of their businesses depend on it.Krentz temps us with one villain after another until the desperate culprit turns his extortion to murder. Like a puzzle, the pieces start falling into place and the murderer is cornered. An intriguing romantic mystery."
3,Mystery with a dash of romance.,"This mystery was pretty good. It was less predictable than some of Jayne Ann Krentz's others. I found the romance to be rather uninspired but not so dull as to be boring. This isn't Krentz's best work but if you like a good mystery with just a dash of romance, this might be the book for you."
2,a gentleman's C...or D,"I'm so happy I checked this out of the library. It wasn't truly horrible, but not that great either...definitely very very average. I doubt that i'm going to read anything else of hers. This is the 3rd or 4th I've read in hopes that she has reverted back to her old ways, but I give up!"
1,Just couldn't get into it,"I gave FLASH plenty of chances. I tried it once, but gave up when a more interesting book came along. I tried it again. Still no headway. Finally, wanting to get *something* out of the money I spent, I skimmed the book. The ideas were there, but the story wasn't. I'm just glad I only spent the paperback price.Whoever's been masquerading as Jayne Ann Krentz should really be apprehended and put away so one of my favorite authors can return to wow us again. I can't think of another explanation for this recent spate of clunkers."
2,Don't Bother,"What's up with Krentz? Her recent books are nothing more than blah, like she's coasting and using some formula that's on her computer where she just cuts and pastes and any book that is more than $5.00 should at least be consistent, but this one is spotty at best."
2,This hurt me,Terrible dialogue. Everybody speaks in full sentences and is careful to tell each other everything the reader needs to know. Annoying hero and heroine. I did NOT fall in love with either of them. And the worst: a villian who explains the whole plot at the end of the book while stalking his victims.Ouch!
2,Not that well written,"I usually really hate to critize a book like this, but this book was not what I expected it to be. This book was to be romantic suspense, but where was the romance? This book focused mainly on the mystery(which was solved by the the time you reached the middle of the book), and then the story kinda dragged on, probably to finish the love story. The love story was okay, but there was no serious focus on it and it just kinda closed off. In the end, for my first book by Krentz, it was not the greatest."
2,Flash in the Pan,"Forgettable drivel! I keep giving Krentz one more chance to redeem herself and she just can't! I don't mind reading romance that's fast-paced, fun and a bit shallow. Can't always read ""keepers"". But FLASH was full of characters that had potential but never developed. Olivia and Jasper - so different but all of a sudden in love! Getting married! COME ON!! And too much side line action going on - too many relatives and secondary characters. I think that's enough Krentz. For quite awhile."
4,Not too bad at all!,"I have been able to follow the progress of an author from the start of her career, reading the first novels she produced and now I am a number of years down the track.Written ten years after the previous novel by Judith Ann Krentz' which I reviewed - Test of Time - I can appreciate the tightening of her wording, the more sophisticated plot which makes use of the technology available at that time. It has been interesting to see how this author has developed and will be more so as I progress to the present day.The characters of Flash are likeable - though stereotypes of Krentz - the ""computer/businessman unable to display normal loving behaviour (a nerd in other words) who falls for the smart, intelligent woman who has a crazy family which she supports in every way.I enjoyed the book and found no areas where I felt I couldn't continue reading."
4,Great but not perfect,"As always, you will never find a perfect cookware. This Cuisinart 7 piece is no exception. It is great but not perfect. Its light weight is very impresive and handle isn't that hot after long period of cooking time. Easy to clean. The non-stick surface is better than other brand. It takes very short time to heat up stuff too. However, couple weaknesses, the lit does not have a small hole to release pressure which we have to watch out for overheat spill. Plus the lit is not the same design as the pot itself, it heats up really quick. So be careful. It is not a good idea to buy plastic handle with the lit, it will deform and loose after a while. Over all, it is better than what I expected even though I have owned this set of cookware for 4 weeks."
3,Quality isn't great,"The coating of these pans started to come off after two years. The cuisinart customer service was good and replaced 3 of these pans already. However, the coating in one of the new ones is starting to come off again. They would be great if this didn't happened."
5,Auburn apron,"I am thrilled with this apron. The price was extremely reasonabe. It is well made, and definitely exceeded my expectations."
4,"Magnificent , descriptive and yet remote","This book is set of short stories translated from German. I am not sure whether it is the authors gift or this gift in combination with the translation which give these stories their sense of remoteness and in some cases alienation. In most fiction, the author strives to involve the reader as closely as possible with the character and the narrative, however in these stories, the reader is held at a remove, the characters seem to carry on almost in suspended animation and at times the stories do not work towards an understandable conclusion. However for all that, they are magnificent, memorable and thought provoking. I won't say more, read them"
3,Rich in content and poor in arrangement of the examples,"The content reveals a lot of details of RS. However, I had a hard time to make the samples running."
3,only for a robot chicken fan...,"I was somewhat disappointed in the RC-version, especially after having seen the hilarious 'Family Guy' version much earlier. I think maybe I had my hopes too high. Still a pretty decent show for the die-hard Robot Chicken fan...but I wish someone would have burned me a copy so I wouldn't have spent any money on it."
2,not unrated,"I didn't like Robot chicken star wars because the cuss words were bleeped out. it said this dvdis unrated, but it still bleeps out the cusswords."
2,"Yes, but it's censored.","I was so hoping this release would be uncensored. Instead we get bleeps where all the ""naughty words"" are spoken.Thanks, moralists who don't even watch this stuff anyway."
2,What's the big deal?,"I was nine years old when Star Wars came out in 1977. I got the action figures, saw the movies dozens of times, all that stuff. I'm definitely a STAR WARS KID.But the truth is, this Robot Chicken episode just isn't all that funny. I got way more enjoyment out ofFamily Guy - Blue Harvest, because it was a straight-up parody, not this disjointed rapid-fire collection of random sketches. I've always found Robot Chicken to be hit-and-miss, but I expected more from this highly-touted episode.Now, if you find yourself among the folks who DID like it, you'll be thrilled by all the extras. Personally, I don't think this very average piece of work warrants so many bonus features."
5,"Hilarious, Best Star Wars Parody Around!","Robot Chicken always takes the cake with their parodies, but they really outdid themselves with Star Wars this time! I just loves all the bits and pieces of the Star War World that we got to glimpse into, broken and jagged and hilraious! Seth Green is a genious and this dvd will have you cracking up! The deleted scenes aren't much, just scetches really with some sound effects, but I would have liked to see the lego bit come to life. What did make it to screen was well worth the effort though, as is all of Robot Chicken. I just think its all little bits of masterpieces brought together with the leftover toys of our 80's playrooms and the mind's of genius who admire the more serious sort and make excellent parodies based on such. Star Wars fans will not be let down here! Way better than the Family Guy parody of Star Wars (any of them). This is really just for anyone who like parodies or Robot Chicken, or comedy. A must!"
5,Absolute must-see for fans of Star Wars,"Seth Green and the writes of Robot Chicken show that their love of Star Wars extends beyond just the movies. This was utterly enjoyable, even though a few scenes were lackluster. The rest of the show makes up for it, and then some.I have yet to see the second part, but I am definitely going to get it soon.If you are a fan of Star Wars, get this."
5,Genious.,"One of the greatest things I've ever witnessed in my whole life.But seriously, perfect comedic timing from people who clearly KNOW Star Wars. Loved it. DVD has lots of behind the scenes/extra bits/goofing around which is all strange but entertaining.Brilliant."
3,"Too short, but still amusing to a degree","I bought this mostly on an impulse and I'm kind of wishing I had just rented it. The whole thing is about a half-hour long, and while there are some amusing commentary from the creators, voice actors and so forth, and a few 'unused' skits, the extras felt a bit lacking. I would recommend this only for star wars or robot chicken fans."
4,A light hearted and rediculously fun romp...,"A VERY enjoyable collection of silly shorts by the maniacs of ""Robot Chicken""... A nice addition to my ""Star Wars"" flicks..."
2,"GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT,DON'T BOTHER WASTING YOUR MONEY","was expecting this to be uncut and instead was disappointed by it as it is the same as the television broadcast,considering on sueing adult swim,seth green and company for false advertising of this product.so, if you want to hear everything being bleeped out or if your as mad as i am about this then don't waste your time and money on this product as it is the same on your tv as it is here."
1,"Nothing like I expected,",I never expected the video to be so absurd. Very short. Could not get any real connection to Star Wars. Might as well have paid for a blank video.
1,You've got to be kidding.....,Look this was an awesome compilation of Star Wars clips but by it's self on dvd? C'mon this should have clearly been part of season 3. I'll rent it and rip it. I suggest you do the same. There goes another 15 bucks for a half an hour dvd.
4,DVD Extras,"From the Adult Swim forums, the list of extras are supposed to include:* Chicken Nuggets (Sketch by Sketch Video Commentary)* Animation Meeting* On-Air Bumps* Trailers* Behind-the-Scenes Featurette* Deleted Scenes* Alternate Audio* Time Lapse Sequences* Photo Gallery* STAR WARS Celebration IV Convention Panel Presentation* Production Design Featurette* Episode Commentary - more than two hours"
5,Captivating,What a fun way to learn! This book is jam packed with adventure and enriched with interesting Egyptian facts along the way! The story line also encompasses a young lady coming into her own. I highly recommend it!
2,Just more praise and worship songs!,"This is just another cd of Tesh singing more worship songs. Unlike a deeper faith one, there are no independently written songs. A deeper faith one has Mondays Mission on it, which is an absolutely beautiful peace of his work. This album is just John singing about cover music from other artists."
3,so so...,Nice case but not metal like it says... its a hard plastic case. The plastic screen cover popped off in less than a week. Only thing that was nice was the sticky screen protector that was included to cover the swivel wheel and screen once the hard cover popped off.
5,It's About Time!!!,I have been searching all over the internet for information on how to migrate whether it's to 2000 or 2003 server and I finally found it. Now I will be participating in a migration from 4.0 to 2003 server and my answers to my boss where from the book our test lab so far is going great thanx to this baby here!! I recommend if you wanna learn how to migrate GET this book!!!
3,Pretty good.,"This selection of tracks offers some new angles, but most tracks don't stand out. The worst thing is the recording is very bass light. It's worth owning, bug not particularly memorable.Try Keepsakes and the new tracks on there first if you are revisiting AAE after a large gap; if you like me have just found out they came back years ago."
1,Not for me,"Had to return this pot. The bottom is not flat and spins around on my ceramic flat-top stove. When I tried to stir something in it, the darned thing kept spinning, and I wasn't always in a position to hold it still with my other hand. Quite frustrating and not worth the trouble."
1,Hard Anodize Gone after only ONE USE!,"I purchased one of these ""Hard Anodized"" pots last week and used it once to boil some green beans. To my amazement, the dark grey finish on the inside dissolved and is completely gone leaving only bare silver-colored aluminum!What a cheap, phony product!"
2,Good for boiling water but don't cook in it,The only thing this pot is good for is boiling water. Anything you try to cook in it will scorch unless you watch it like a hawk. It is too thin to heat evenly so it has a hot spot right in the center where the burner/gas flame is hottest.
5,"quality pot, easy to clean","Great for soups, chilis... Non-stick surface makes clean-up easy (just be sure not to use metal utensils so you dont scratch it). Glad I picked this over stainless steel."
5,Great pot to have on hand,"This is a great pot to have on hand for making big pots of soup. It's easy to clean, and I particularly like the clear glass lid, so I can peek in on the food without lifting the lid. I'd definitely buy this again."
3,Warehouse Deal Stockpot didn't work out but pot was nice....,"I loved the pot. I got the Warehouse Deal (Like new condition). I've bought many Warehouse Deal items from Amazon and only get the Like New condition items. I've never had issue with one of them.....until now. I cannot believe that Amazon would sell this stockpot when the one they sent me was not round but rather oval shaped and of course, the lid didn't fit since it's round.I'm a longtime customer and this is the first time Amazon has managed to make me question their quality assurance.Now I will return it at Amazon's cost and I don't have a stockpot. I won't buy another Warehouse Deal for this stockpot. Just can't trust what I'll get."
5,Good Product,This is a great product. It cooks evenly and cleans up like a dream. Reccomend this particular pan to anyone
1,Expected cheaply made--got faulty junk,"There is a huge bar code label half the length of the small handle. Can't peel, scrape, or soak it off. My time-wasted efforts have left most of the label as a unhygenic ugly mess. As to the strainer itself, I expected cheap but got faulty: the wire mesh protrudes from the outside edge of plastic rim moulded over it; there are some much-larger-than-the-mesh holes in the screen."
1,NEC FE992,"Below average quality product. I am a professional photographer. Onscreen color and contrast are very important in preparing images for print or web applications. Consistancy between monitors is also important.I purchased two of these items in the hopes of having matching systems in our office. No way -- not only did they not come close to matching each other, but as stand alones they were very bad. I returned them both, and a third ordered from a local source.OK for a JR High kid, not good enough for anybody that works with color in detail."
3,Good for some,"This is a very good book for those who want to practice their brush stroke order, in traditional Character.But for those who are learning the Simplified script, this is of little value.It also only goes over the NEW WORDS in the chapters of PRACTICAL CHINESE READER. It does not go over the SUPPLEMENTARY WORDS that you get in each chapter. This is unfortunate, because That is why I bought this. I was hoping to get a workbook that covered all the words in the chapter, not just the basic ones."
1,Sucks,"If you want the same old, bang bang rob the bank, movie then go ahead and by this low brow movie. Take it from me it sucks."
4,complete your bangles'collection,"a good cd, for fans but not only. songs are well played, better sung and very joyful to listen. susannah hoffs is sunny and nice as well. the cd is not too long, so the listener doesn't bore. there are rare songs and rare versions of well known pieces. a cd for everybody loving byrds, the heartbreakers and the sound of 12 string electric Rickenbacker."
4,you need to scale down,Really handy if you are into back packing for weighing your small items and determining what items are really necessary or for splitting up gear between the hiking party. Liked that I could remove the tray and place larger items on it. Also like the range of measuring capability. Not so good if you are in to lab precision.
3,I like the item but....,The item I ordered is very nice and good looking but I guess this is my mistake because I wanted a scale to determine how many ounces in a portion of food and really this scale is more for the baker who wants to determine what the ingredients weigh. The ounces are a bit too small to see to really tell what a portion is of an item. I guess I chose the wrong type of scale.
4,not as good as vol.1,Volume one is mutch better than volume 2. I definetly think that vol.2 is worth buying though. If you like atb and george acosta type trance GET IT!!!!!
5,jazz collectors note - a immensely valuable masterpiece,"I got this album used because of 4 tracks (and part of a 5th) featuring Anita O'Day, from her cameos in ZigZag (1971) and in The Outfit (1973). Some of these tracks are very rare, not in the movies or even on the vinyl soundtracks. Somebody must have stumbled on them while assembling this CD years later. Her version of ""On Green Dolphin Street"" is a wonderful boss nova.The greatest commercial value of the album is that it records the arrangements and performances of jazz bandleader Oliver Nelson.There are two CDs. Let's hope Sony/MGM recognizes the value of this album and rereleases it in some medium."
4,The Man Who Could Have Been So Much More,"As a historian, Nielsen, who was born in Texas and has some Wendish heritage, often writes about subject matter of which he has some first hand knowledge. Quite apart from his personal ties with this history, however, the story is worth telling-- and he tells it well. Killian was tri-lingual, a theologian, a poet, an intellectual, but he became displaced, trapped, on the Texas frontier. He is remembered as a village pastor, but his parishioners hardly knew what he could have been. Surely such stories were common among immigrants. Some, found it possible to express their genius in new and creative ways. Others felt they had misread the opportunities in this new land and never realized their potential. Both stories are worth reading because both types are found within all of us. And stories like this help us to respect what might have been and decry what was lost, but also to encourage the latent gifts within each of us, whatever our setting and opportunity."
4,GREAT MOVIE BUT DOES NOT FOLLOW THE BOOK,"I RECEIVED ""KISS THE GIRLS"" & ""ALONG CAME A SPIDER"" AS GIFTS AND COULDN'T WAIT TO VIEW THEM. BOTH MOVIES ARE GOOD, MORGAN FREEMAN IS A GOOD ACTOR, BUT ANY RESEMBLENCE BETWEEN THE NOVELS & THE MOVIES IS PURELY BY CHANCE. FREEMAN IS NOT THE ALEX CROSS PORTRAYED IN PATTERSON'S NOVELS, AND PLOT IN THE MOVIE BARELY RESEMBLES THE STORY LINE IN THE NOVELS. GLAD I READ THE BOOKS FIRST."
3,Read the book instead!,"The movie was okay... but after reading the novel, the movie doesn't even compare!!!The book is filled with tons of detail and suspense.The movie is far from what was written, but none the less a decent movie to keep you entertained. It does have a great suspense and thrill to it at each moment.If you like thrillers it's worth watching a few times!"
3,"Morgan, Monica, & Mika!","Everytime a Morgan movie comes out, you can expect it to follow certain guidelines, and he will MAKE the movie. But in this one Mika Boorem (kidnapped girl)also shines as a star that just hasn't been cast enough since. Monica Potter holds up her end of the acting to the high point of Freemans's and never lets it drop. We aren't seeing enough of her either. I don't know about the book, but I was in full support of Monica's character all the way to the credits. That takes a great actress.If you are loyal to the book, the actors in this movie alone should be enough to convince you to watch."
2,not that great,"I just finished reading the book by James Patterson, which was great, so I had some high expectations for the movie. The movie wasn't all that bad, but it was lacking. There is so much action in the book and I just don't understand why they didn't put more of that action into the movie. If half of the action scenes from the book were included in the movie, I guaruntee I would have given it at least two more stars. The worst part of the movie, in my opinion is when Alex Cross just so happens to guess the completely improbable password for Jezzie's computer. Not only that, but she has a picture of her rental house and all its information on her computer. Who does that?! Since he got all the information about the house on Jezzie's computer, he goes to the house and saves the day. That scene ruined the movie for me. If you liked the movie and haven't read the book, I strongly recommend reading it. The book truly puts the movie to shame."
3,Bearable.,"Monica Potter only needs a nose job and 1 good role to break it big. Unfortunately, neither come in this movie. Maybe a nose job would get rid of some of that whine in her voice too. Regardless, this movie is somewhat entertaining if never inspiring. The plot has large holes that are never explained and that only seem more implausible upon further reflection. The movie has decent moments of suspense, but the twist about halfway through throws the whole movie out of whack and only leads to a predictable ending. Freeman does an admirable job in his role, but it's not up to the standards of his previous work. All in all, this movie will progress your life about 2 hours."
2,"Weak, hurried, unbelievable","This was a thrown together movie to get on the screen and look good and make some money...quickly. At least it sure seemed that way to me. They did not challenge the audience to think, they just threw some ridiculous twists in. Could have been much better and it does NOT compare with Kiss The Girls except the Freeman is in both. KTG was much better."
4,Suspenceful it was,The kiddnaper kidnaps but not for money...but for fame and to be able to have morgan freeman to be on his case. But someone else kidnaps from the kidnapper....they want the money and to pin it on the original kidnapper....who in the heck is the real bad guy...it leaves you wondering for awhile...you think you know...the you don't know...I love a movie that has you guessing. It's a good movie...but don't think along the line of the first movie....it's nothing like it. It is it's own movie... and a good movie it is.
2,Nothing but curds and whey,"Morgan Freeman returns as Det. Alex Cross and teams with Secret Service agent Monica Potter to find a senator's kidnapped daughter. Hollywood churns out yet another safe adaptation of a blockbuster best seller. The plot lurches along, introducing characters and abandoning them (Jay O. Sanders), and wrapping itself up with a tidy conclusion. Freeman is outstanding, as always, but the rest of the cast cannot back him up. Tamahori's direction is fine, except for a terrible CGI car crash in the opening minutes. The surprise ending is okay, but I read the novel and knew what would happen. No vision, no suspense, no repeat viewings. The little girl is filmdom's smartest kidnap victim, but Michael Moriarty and Penelope Ann Miller are utterly wasted."
2,Does Morgan Freeman play any other character?,I mean really...all of the movies I've see him in. He plays the same damn character. Staunch and starchy. I guess you always know what to expect in his movies.As far as this movie goes. It's definitely a rental. Story lags at times and the surprises arent really surprising.
2,Could this have been more boring?,"I saw this movie at the theater when it first opened and thought it was a snoozefest.The acting was sub-par, the plot was predictable, the ""twists"" weren't twisty enough. In short, this is a so-so movie that just happens to have one of today's best actors wasting away in it: Morgan Freeman.Normally, the presence of Mr. Freeman is enough to elevate any movie to a level higher than two stars. However, if it hadn't been for him, I would have given this movie one star. I thought it was that bad.In fact, all back-of-the-box blurbs regarding its ""suspense"" and ""mystery"" and ""surprises"" aside, this is the kind of movie you'll want to rent before you buy it. And rent the VHS, too, spending the least amount of money you can. For heaven's sake, do NOT buy this movie -- especially on the more expensive DVD format -- before you watch it. You're likely to sorely regret it."
1,Read the Book please! The movie is a bomb!,Along came a spider was the first book from James Patterson that set me on my coarse to reading all his books. I couldn't wait to see the movie. Now I wish I never laid eyes on it. And the casting for both of his movies. Alex Cross has two adorable kids. This Alex Cross is to old. and no kids. Read the books. If another movie comes out go bowling.
3,Decent movie but the book was much better,"Just like a lot of novels that are turned into films, some major aspects were omitted during the translation. Morgan Freeman was great as always, but parts of the film moved extremely slow and I found my attention dwindling. However, if you are a fan of James Patterson and the Alex Cross series, it is worth checking out."
2,Uninvolving.,"At any point in this film, I could have walked away without a backward glance. I didn't care about any of the characters in the film. It does have a surprise ending, for whatever that is worth."
3,along came a spider,"I was disappointed in this much anticipated DVD. Not that the DVD version was much different than the VHS, but I have read the book, and was looking forward to the Hollywood version. Never again. Is Hollywood fearfull of interracial relationships, or is it just me? I read the book, and had no problem with it, but the movie is quite different. The female lead, and the male lead are probably 20 years apart in age, or so it seems. They are straying so far apart from the book in that aspect...what's wrong with casting say Kathy Bates for this female lead? If Hollywood refuses to follow such serious subplots as this then why bother? It is an extremly good storyline, with a surprising twist, but why leave something out that is so defining?"
2,Predictable,"I give this movie 2.5 stars because it is not bad but yet not really good.It is predictable in the plot, there are scenes in the beginning where the filming of the special effects doesn't seem real, kind of like a comic book.But Morgan Freeman and Monica Potter turn in convicing roles and raise this movie above the rating that should have stuck with it. It is a mystery/crime drama that by the very nature of its plot would seem to bee ho hum, seen them all. But with the performances of Freeman and Potter it is raised quite a few notches.Not your first movie to rent but certainly not on the bottom of the pile either, maybe 70% of the way through the ""view list""."
1,Very Disappointing,I read along came a spider and when I saw the movie I was really disappointed about how the movie went it had nothing whatsoever to do with the book. Movies will pretty much follow a storyline dealing with the book but this movie wasn't one of them. I would hope that a movie coming out after the book would be good but I wouldn't recommend anyone buying this movie.
3,Disappointed,"The movie was good and Morgan Freeman was excellent as the star. However, I had just finished reading the book and was anxious to see the movie. Imagine my disappointment, when the movie did not even resemble the book in the slightest way. Do yourself a favor, and read the book! You won't be disappointed. I am surprised that James Patterson would allow a total change of his plot."
1,ick,"I'm not a fan on james patterson, I think his novels are cheap supermarket money-making slapstick ""thrillers"", but that's just my opinion. The movie was even worse than the movie. The book was kind of like ""Primal Fear"", (primal fear is better, rent that instead!) but there is no sign of personality split in the movie. It's a horrible adaptation. Don't waste your money, especially if you've read the novel."
1,Terrible movie,"What can I say - bad script, bad acting, bad movie.You know it's bad when you keep looking at your watch hoping it is almost over.The movie just doesn't move - it drags and drags and drags. The bad guy is so dull you can't understand why he even bothered to kidnap the victim.The real kicker for me was when the supposed good (ravinish babe) turns into the evil killer who had this all planned all along..."
5,Black Widow!!,"I really liked this movie. It had a great story line about a man who had planned a kidnapping based on the Lindberg baby kidnapping. The setting took place in a private school for children with well-to-do parents in the public eye. Morgan Freeman was the lead detective on this case. He was as good in this movie as he was in Seven. Monica Potter was a secret service agent assigned to the area where the kidnapping eventually took place. Throughout the movie, she blames herself countless times for missed opportunities and such. Her character will pull herself together though for she is has a plan and know exactly what she is doing. I gave this movie 5 stars, because of the plot twists and the surprise ending. It was definitely NOT expected."
4,James Patterson story.,Morgan Freeman is great as usual. Typical James Patterson story. He captures your attention from the beginning. Streaming of sound was jerky throughout.
3,Pretty Good Thriller,"Let's face it, just about any movie with Morgan Freeman is going to be good, by virtue of his being in the movie. This film is no exception. Although the book was better, the movie is still pretty good. Morgan Freeman brings just the right amount of soulful caring about the victims, and can still be tough guy when needed. Monica Potter is still a Julia Roberts wanna be, but she is more than adequate in her role as Alex Cross' (Morgan Freeman) unexpected partner. There are lots of plot holes, and the 'surprise' twist can be seen coming about half way into the movie, but I still enjoyed it."
3,Pretty Good Sequel!!,"First and foremost, the movie is not as good as the original, but it is as entertaining. This is not a boring movie; it will hold your attention. The stand out elements are the Lindbergh clues left by the kidnapper in the classroom and on the computer and the super surprise ending. I felt that they could have did without the precredit sequence where Cross's partner gets killed, though. It is immensely entertaining and the uniqueness is that it is not the traditional whodunit because we are introduced to the villain early on in the film (or are we??) The plot does not drag like a good percentage of sequels or in this case, prequels. I recommend it for Morgan Freeman fans and fans who were intrigued with the film's predecessor, Kiss the Girls."
4,Saw it coming a mile away!!,"Good acting, fare story line, some what predictable. But no one beats Morgan Freeman in this type role. Wish they would have developed the main characters a little better"
1,An overall bore..........,"This movie was so dull! I'm surprised by this, as I liked Kiss the Girls, and Morgan Freeman is usually in pretty decent films. I have to say, though, that this was really horrible. Monica Potter was utterly unconvincing and her character pretty unlikeable. Come to think of it, I really didn't like any of the characters....or I should say, I didn't care one bit about them. Considering the story is about the kidnapping of a senator's young daughter, one would at least anticipate feeling sympathy and sorrow for the innocent child, but this film can't even deliver a ""gimme"" such as that! The plot was mucky and I honestly could have turned this movie off at any point and not given it another thought, such was my unconcern for the ending. However, I did endure the movie to its long-awaited end, so I can reliably express to you that it's not worth it!"
4,"3 stars for the movie, 1 star for Monica Potter.","I could write a bunch of stuff here trying to convince you that I'm smarter than you but that's pretty much a waste of my time and yours. I like this movie in spite of a few flaws and glitches, to me the overall product is often more important than the parts it's comprised of. The story line has interesting twists, it has actors in it I like. So I give the movie itself three stars and toss in another star just because I get to watch Morgan Freeman act and Monica Potter be cute as hell (I just REALLY REALLY wish she could act but cute will do). Not a bad way to spend an hour or two."
2,Read the Book,"I first read the early 90's and was looking forward to seeing this film, only to be dissappointed. I had to re-read the book after seeing it. The only things taken from the book are the names and the title. The book fleshes out the character of Gary Soneji. The movie not only does the movie keep Soneji character in the background but they kill him off at the end. Fans of the Alex Cross books know that Soneji is in two other books after this one. If you haven't read the book, you will enjoy the movie. My advice is to read the book. It is a lot more suspenseful than the movie."
4,"Pretty good movie, but...","I have read all of the Alex Cross novels and as great an actor as Morgan Freeman is, he is terribly mis-cast as Alex Cross. Cross is described as a 40 year old Muhammad Ali look alike. Not even close. Of course, there is the part in the movie that they kill off a character that appears in a later novel. Maybe it was all a dream as it was for a whole season of ""Dallas"".As with most books made into movies, something is missing. I think what is missing is the screen writers reading the whole book.All that said, I did enjoy the movie. There are enough twists and turns to keep you entertained."
3,Along Came A Spider,This was a good movie to watch but was not like the book. If you have read the book you may be a little disappointed.
3,Union Station,"Beautiful shots of Washington Union Station, but that ain't the underground Metro. Could the MTA subway be LA's Red Line?..though I doubt if it runs above ground.Hollywood racism makes sure the relationship between the leads remains purely professional and platonic, though I'm convinced if 2 whites or 2 blacks played the lead roles we would surely see sparks flying!"
3,Good ending but!,"This movie is based on a classical scenario. It is quite boring to see the same scheme again: a cop who feels responsible for the death of his partner and finds a new one. There are some flaws in the scenario: no adequate reason for the killer to call Alex, and the scene where ALex discovers the password of the PC in a short time is quite unbelievable. The final is well designed and worths watching the movie. Good DVD, fair sound, Digital surround adds not too much to the movie."
5,Not disappointed--Morgan Freeman is always good,"Morgan Freeman is the man in whatever movie he is in. But ok, looking at the movie from the script's perspective I have to agree with some that it's a little lacking there. Though the plot had good twist, the dialog and story seemed a little jumpy...rushed. I enjoyed it though, for a non-scary, yet interesting movie. It's not one I have to watch again to figure anything out though, and that's what I gauge a good mystery by...nothing was subtle here and I could see where the story was going clearly.""Sonji wouldn't ask for money if he had the money if he had the girl"" and then there was a ransom of 'money' asked for... well any mystery buff would have to figure...he must not have had the girl anymore...little things like that stood out.But all in all, it was good and I was satisfied. Good Friday night popcorn and apple martini movie...for all Morgan Freeman fans."
2,Disappointing and Predictable,"Morgan Freeman, current [actor] of the Thinking-Cop film genre (in which nobody really thinks at all), is trapped in yet another dud. It's one of those thrillers that try to be creepy by alluding to childhood stories and weaving unsettling nursery rhymes into the soundtrack. Little Megan is the daughter of a senator who gets abducted by her history teacher; luckily, she is a graduate of the Macauley Culkin School of Hi-Jinks and Shenanigans and is smart enough to outwit her captor. Aside from a few unexpected twists, the film is basically so predictable from the start that it's pointless to even sit through it at all. The stage is set and, like robotic toys, the actors march dutifully through their motions. Scenes progress as they should, it all happens as it's been programmed to, and we walk out of the theater none the wiser."
2,Poor Imitation of Book,"The book was so much better than the movie. The female lead was no where near as interesting a character as she was in the book. Book built the suspense far better, movie just kind of fizzled to an ending. This was the first Alex Cross book I read and if I had seen the movie before reading the book I probably would not have read and enjoyed all the Alex Cross books. If you haven't read the book, I highly recommend it over the movie."
2,Skip it!,"If you've seen Kiss the Girls, You've seen this. Do something else with your two hours,For the bed ridden only."
3,"Good On Twists, Lousy On The Conclusion","""Along Came A Spider"" is a very interesting thriller that has a great performance by Morgan Freeman -reprising the role of police psychiatrist Alex Cross from ""Kiss The Girls"" -and an interesting score by Jerry Goldsmith. This movie also has a couple of twists that look like to be a spider web.In spite of developing the movie in a very attractive way, director Lee Tamahori seemed to have wanted to end his film quickly by giving the final twist on a silver platter; he doesn't give you the chance of figuring it out. Now that's disappointing for a fine thriller. I wish I could tell something about it, but the problem is I'd be ruining the movie in case those of you who are interested in watching it. Go ahead and watch it, and you'll find out."
2,A Disappointment,"I'm a big fan of Morgan Freeman, however, the writers didn't do the book justice. Key elements were left out of the movie that made the book such a success. Another big disappointment was the supporting role played by Monica Potter. She simply didn't match the part. If you've read the book, don't even consider the movie."
4,Seems to be the real deal,"My husband owned a version of this same watch for years and loved it (well, except that the band broke 2x/year for the past 3-4 years), so we decided to replace it instead of investing in fixing the band (just go leather next time!) He disbelieved it was the real thing as the price was so low, but even he can't see any difference to his original watch so we're both happy with it. He showers daily with his on, and swims with it too, and it always took the treatment perfectly."
3,The tool kit I received does not look like the picture.....,"The kit I received is by something called ""Art Alternatives"" not ""Pro Art"" like the description said, on top of that the tools were light wood and not stained. I am grateful to have received a tool kit at all. I did not return it due to pure laziness and have already started using them, they work like they should. I have not used my ribbon tools yet but they look fine other than the fact that they don't look like the picture."
2,overpriced - I give it the Rip-off award.,This company must be smoking something. This is way overpriced even by mini mart retail standards. 10 dollars for the battery plus another 6 for S&H equals 4 times what the manufacturer is charging. Go to WAHL and buy direct. These folks are giving piracy a bad name.
2,Insensitive to Buddhists,"While Shopping for Buddhas is mildly entertaining as a travelogue, I found myself increasingly offended by Greenwald's commercial exploitation of the West's recycled interest in Eastern thought. Greenwald makes his own religious ambivalence abundantly clear, even as he opens each chapter with a buddhist lesson which, one presumes, has somehow affected him. Careful to always capitalize God to the point of sanctimony, I was distracted by his ego-centric sidebar willingness to poke fun at all the other gods he encountered on his travels. Finally, in the end, I concluded Mr. Greenwald, apparently an anxious, scorekeeping traveler, elected to commercially trade on his knowledge of this part of the world in a way which left this reader feeling trespassed."
4,fun and easy,"I read Shopping for Buddhas while reading Snake Lake. It did take me about 1/3 of the way through the book to realize this is humor, but once I did it is a great time. I do not think there is any intention here to show off enlightenment or espouse philosophy, there are many other books for that. This is a light jaunt through what can be a confusing new way of seeing. The author is honest enough to expose his early naiveté and western consumer baggage. I think fans of this author know that Nepal and Jeff Greenwald have grown and changed a great deal since 1996. This is a fun, easy book, I recommend it."
3,Nothing Special,"Kind of blah traveler's tale, ostensibly about this dude's quest to purchase a ""perfect"" statue of the Buddha in the bazaars of Katmandu. Along the way we get vignettes about Nepal and a very, very casual overview of life and politics there. Neither particularly engaging, nor particularly loathsome."
2,consumerist hippie buddhism,"This book starts out in a very promising manner and during the first 20 pages or so I was looking forward to a good read. But it soon degenerates into trivialities, and anyone with an interest in Buddhist art will soon realise Greenwald doesn't have a clue about Buddhist sculpture (this wouldn't matter except that in the writing he pretends to).The hash-intoxicated epiphany that serves as the book's ending is the most disappointing of all. This might have made a good stop along the way, but the early buildup raises one's expectations and it feels rather unsatisfactory to say the least. (Greenwald's Size of The World suffers from a similar balance problem.)Readers who like this book will probably be those with limited exposure to travel in Nepal and to Buddhism/Buddhist art. I liked Jeff's earlier book on Nepal, Mr Raja's Neighborhood, more (I see that's out of print, too)."
1,A Perfect Buddha Does Not Make a Perfect Book,The book is a poorly crafted story about a man so self indulgent and arrogant that he equates a pot induced stupor to enlightenment. The author's irreverence to Buddhism might be excused if there was even some small acnowledgement of the validity of others' beliefs. Greenwald was determined to write a book no matter what it took. It is not surprising that he wrote a book about himself. This isn't a book about a man searching for the perfect Buddha. It is a book about a self obsessed man searching for something to write about.
4,Got some good laughs,"I bought this book while traveling through Thailand and undergoing my own quest for an acceptable Buddha (perfection was too high a standard). Yeah, the writer comes across as self-absorbed and arrogant, and he reminded me of fellow Westerners who had embarrassed me during my travels. However, this book was an entertaining read with situations that I could identify with. I needed an escape and some laughs after challenges encountered during travel in Asia, and this book gave those laughs to me. I wasn't expecting perfection from the writer, just entertainment."
4,A personal account of the author's visits to Nepal,"Greenwald offers to readers an introspective look at his visits to Nepal, and his desire to acquire the perfect Buddha statue. Intermingled with his discussions of his shopping expeditions are stories and analogies about Buddhist Gods and the Buddhist and Hindu religions. He also provides an historical look at Nepalese government, and the current (1990) state of the Kingdom.Greenwald's writing is a bit scattered, yet it was easy to read and enjoy. I have a friend who reads quite a lot of travel books and I recommended this to him quite highly.So if you are interested in world religions, politics and travel, this would be a light hearted treat."
1,Not great,This video gives basic instruction that produces a very poor style. I would not recommend this product for any African American wanting to style hair. Spend your money elsewhere. If I could return this item I would.
3,"lots of photos, not much context","This book collects a lot of good old baseball-related photographs from local libraries and newspapers into one package. However, there really isn't much information or context to go along with the photos. Some of the captions barely describe the people and/or event portrayed.Overall, it's an interesting book to browse through, but don't look for a lot of in-depth historical content."
3,Pictures only tell half the story,"How well you enjoy this book depends on your preference : pictures or text. The book consists predominantly of b/w and sepia photographs of the teams, fields, and fans associated with the long and interesting history of baseball in Tampa, St. Petersburg, and Clearwater. The photographs are excellent, but I am among those who would have liked some of that rich history in text."
3,possessing,"The movie was everything I remembered from seeing it years ago on VHS. Picture and sound were good, Shannon was maybe a little past her peak, but still appealing. The story maybe took its self a little too seriously for a B-movie. Believe I've seen most of the cast perform more convincingly elsewhere. More a guilty pleasure than favorite masterpiece."
4,Uniquely good,"The individual parts of this movie.... the soft core porn, the profoundly cheesy special effects, the passable at best acting...should make for a terrible movie. But this is a profound example of the whole being greater than the sum of it parts. At all times a spectacle, it must truly be seen to be believed."
4,"A lovely, lovely disc","Kertesz conducts the Brahms Serenades with vigor and pastoral warmth - the two are not mutually exclusive. Rightly regarded as a minor classic recording in its time, it has been eclipsed by other recordings (Haitink/Concertgebouw 1970s come to mind) due primarily, to improved sonics but not necesarily performance.And the sonics will provide the limitation for some listeners. Early 60s ""London"" sound means some congestion in orchestral tuttis, and minor tape hiss throughout the recording. But don't allow this to deter you. The performances themselves are beautiful and timeless. So are these wonderful Serenades.Put on a fresh pot of coffee, allow the sun to waft through the window shades, put this disc on...and relax."
3,Organic Mama Reads: Fannie in the Kitchen,"Fannie in the Kitchen: The Whole Story from Soup to Nuts of How Fannie Farmer Invented Recipes with Precise Measurements- Author Deborah Hopkinson, Illustrator Nancy CarpenterIf you're thinking that Fannie and the word kitchen sound familiar together, you're right. This is the story of Fannie Farmer - as in the Fannie Farmer cookbook. Credited by some as the inventor of the modern recipe, Fannie was among the first people to create written guidelines for cooking and baking with exact measurements. As a mother's helper in the home of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Shaw, she teaches their young daughter Marcia how to cook by writing her a gigantic book of recipes. Of course, she's soon on her way to being a published author. Very cute book with old fashioned looking dresses and a bonus recipe for griddle cakes in the back. That's pancakes, in case you didn't know. I just like the name griddle cakes better. For more great book reviews, check out [...]"
4,High on Fannie's contributions but short on her life's obstacles,"I liked the book Fannie in the Kitchen for the children in the intended age group; however, it could have taught a little more valuable life lesson on overcoming the obstacles of her physical problems, especially during that time in history, where they prevented her from going off to college and pretty much took her out of the usual marriage market. She made the best of her situation. She made significant contributions to the science of cooking and eating healthy food.The 7 through 9 year olds I read this to enjoyed it though. The illustrations were terrific!"
5,Fannie in the Kitchen,"My granddaughter and I enjoyed reading this book together. At the end of the story is a recipe for pancakes, made the ""old-fashioned"" way. We had fun making, and eating, them."
4,Very good,I haven't used this for my daughter yet but it came in a timely manner and was in good condition.
4,Nice watch for the money paid,Looks great for the money paid. Appears to be good quality. Time will tell how it holds up.
1,Item never in stock,"This item is always listed but has been out of stock twice now. If it's not available, why list it?"
2,like sleeping on a wool sweater,its one of the cheapest lambskins for baby which is why i bought it. But it's hard and rough to sleep on. I later bought a natural mimosa tanned lambskin from kaiser of Germany and would highly recommend it. It is more expensive at around 90$ and harder to find but safer chemical free and way way way softer and better quality. A little smaller though also. I use the bowrons on the floor to play on now and the other in my daughter's bed.
5,the best gift for baby,I give these for baby gifts -they are the bestI have bought many and every recipient agrees they are great
1,"Sheepskin contains antimony, phosphorous, arsenic!","Please think twice before purchasing this as any type of baby bedding if it is not covered in polyethylene. Sheepskin has a direct link to SIDS/Cot death, it gives off toxic nerve gases (phosphorines, arsines and stibines). Do a little research into that issue at least before purchasing this or any skeepskin product for your baby. Yes, it's soft and luxurious, but is that worth the life of your child?"
1,Unprofessionalism in music,"I have never in my life heard a more unprofessional recording. High school groups have produced more rhythmical and in-tune recordings than Eton has with this CD. I am grossly disappointed that a musician of this poor quality can release his own CD, and I am even more shocked that the American public cannot hear the difference between music of high quality and this garbage. Maybe the American public should reacquaint itself with good music before writing any more reviews."
5,** A Crowning Achievement**,"Eton, I think you have made a big step towards achieving your dream and I commend you for your effort and talent. Very good listening for lovers or for someone who is trying to rekindle a flame. Hey! Valentine is creeping up on us, and this would make a good gift for a girlfriend, boyfriend, wife or husband. I read Mr. Price's review and I am totally disappointed with it. I am not sure which or what CD he was listening to and feel that he should be the one to reacquaint himself with good music, I feel that Eton has done what a lot of people would like to achieve, but cannot do. So instead of bashing him, you should commend him or keep your thoughts to yourself."
3,Not too bad,the overall techniques in the book are good and the characters are cute but I didn't find anything I really wanted to make. Its a good book overall.
5,An excellent book,"This well researched and controversial book makes a deep impression. It raises crucially important questions about the relationship between religion and state as well as casting new light upon twentieth century Japanese history. That even Buddhism, in theory the most peaceful of creeds, could have been so extensively corrupted by a military agenda, gives one manyinsights into human nature, not least, by comparison, into the contemporary phenomenon of guerrilla fundamentalists and their crusading patriotic opponents. The book contains a wealth of fascinating original source material, a feature that not only brings home the reality of war and its moral dilemmas, but also, most importantly, enables the reader to draw his or her own conclusions. An excellent book."
5,Good thing if it's what you need,"Upon opening the package, I noticed no strange smells or foreign debris. The contents were consistent and unremarkable.I use this as a sugar substitute in simple recipes as part of a low carb lifestyle. Not quite as sweet as sugar and it has a sort of cooling effect that I don't notice too much after using it for a year or so. Much smoother in flavor than stevia and not as strong as sugar.It seems to cook well, I've made low carb chocolate muffins and the initial sweet ""bite"" isn't as strong as with real sugar, but they satisfy my need for the occasional sweet without raising blood sugar.The biggest plus is it doesn't make me light headed and dizzy like Splenda--which I've sworn off. I have noticed no side effects, aside from the cooling sensation which I've grown accustomed to and which I don't notice at all in cooked foods."
3,"Used to using sugar substitutes, this one is ok.","I like this sweetener, because it's the one that seems to trigger blood sugar spikes the least. That being said, there's a bit of an aftertaste when baking with this one that I've not seen with some other products. It's pretty good in hot beverages, though!"
2,It was really grainy.,I bought this for my daughter who complain that it was really grainy and gritty. I won't be buying it again. It isn't available at the local health food store.
3,Worked great but......,The company that mailed this product out did so very promptly. The product did a great job of working as a natural sweetner. On the label it stated has been made for thousands of years from fruits. I bought the product and used it and really liked it. My heart was racing occasionally and I thought it was my thyroid. I had a friend that came over and pointed out that much further down on the label it was made from corn now. So if you have allergies to corn this is not the product for you. Also since it is not organic the corn is being used could be GMO corn. So it worked as it should but I had problems with it being made from corn.
2,Powdered and granulated not interchangeable!,"I bought this expecting the ""powdered"" form as it specified and ended up paying for a product I cannot use. The two, granulated(which this IS) and powdered(which it clearly is NOT) are NOT interchangeable within recipes. I felt like I was tricked into buying the wrong product!"
2,Overhyped and rather tasteless,"I decided to purchase this product based on a blog by one of thesupplement oriented doctors on the internet, hyping erythritol assuperior to xylitol, which I use regularly and find the closestto sugar in taste with almost no aftertaste and no side effectsto my knowledge. The problem I find with erythritol is its lackof flavor. On cereal, I barely notice any real sweetness, evenwhen I put as much as a tablespoon and a half on a normal sizebowl. When I use Ideal, the name of the xylitol brand I use, ithas the same sweetness as sugar in the same proportion. Don't getme wrong, erythritol isn't unpleasant, it just has very littlesweetness relative to how much you use. Not worth the price unlessyou want just a hint of sweetness compared to what you get withsugar or xylitol."
1,Didn't really like it....,I was so excited to receive this. Thought I would cut down on the calories. I didn't like the taste at all. We baked a banana bread and we threw it out. I am going to try again with brownies and add a little bit more. Maybe I just did not add enough. I thought it had an after taste though. I will still use it up and try once more.
2,Not very sweet,Not very sweet and does not resolve well. Going back to go ole Stevia. Going to grow my own this year.
3,Bitter!,"I did not like Erythritol, even though it is the main ingredient in Truvia. It was too bitter for me. I would not recommend this product even though it is all natural."
3,"Not a good flavor, Xylitol is much better","I'm giving this three stars because it's so low in calories and doesn't cause gastrointestinal effects. It worked fine when I made my own mint chocolate with unsweetened chocolate and mint extract. That tasted good. But, it was terrible when I made chocolate biscotti (Xylitol works fine). I had to throw the big batch away. It has a strong ""cotton candy"" aftertaste.The gastrointestinal effects of Xylitol can be mostly overcome by gradually increasing the amount you eat over time. It tastes much better than Erythritol. But, as I mentioned, you can make a very interesting bitter mint chocolate with it. The erythritol doesn't dissolve so at first the taste is very bitter not sweet chocolate. Then, as the erythritol dissolves in your mouth, you get a burst of sweetness and cooling effect. The cooling effect of the erythritol is so powerful that is enhances the mint. The chocolate overcomes the ""cotton candy"" aftertaste if you don't use too much erythritol."
4,Great but not perfect,"You know this stuff tastes really good... once you get it to dissolve. I suppose if you have a food processor and can powder it (as its in sugar-esq crystals on arrival) - or can make a liquid variant. Took off one star for the hassle of having to modify it from its original state for use in cold drinks.That being said, does anyone know if the heat + equal parts sugar / water = liquid sugar method will work with Erythritol? Or will the chemical process be different?"
3,not sweet enough,"Not a very cost effective sweetener, takes too much to do the job. I believe that truvia (a combination of erythritol and stevia extract) is much more likable and costs less to use. We didn't mind the taste as some others did, but were glad we only bought one pound."
3,natural sweetner,"This product is not very sweet. I also use Agava nectar and find that sweeter. I was looking for something to take the place of granular sugar. Don't think this is it right now. I'll stick with the agava nectar. Trying to get away from nutra sweet, sweetn low and splenda."
2,This reference book is referencing you everywhere else.,"I am a beginner investor and I am very disappointed with this book. This book gives all kinds of internet address's to look up for investing information. But I bought the book so that so that I wouldn't have to do all the research on the internet. Furthermore, several of the internet addresses come up ""not found""."
4,Pretty Trippy,"Liquidambar takes the reader on a weird and fantastic ride to the city of Fulcrum to meet its strangely familiar and somehow debilitated citizens.When searching for something to compare this novel to, I don't think of other novels, but more computer games such as Grand Theft Auto (with less violence of course) or a movie such as Sin City (again with less violence).There is a pervasively dark and constrained feeling about the action, as if everything is somehow being controlled and the characters, including freelance hack and reluctant private eye Typo Blod, have virtually no free will. They do what they have to do. They act out their pre-ordained roles.None of that makes the book predictable - far from it. And none of it makes it humourless either. Typo has a good line in self-deprecation and many of the scenes are inherently humourous.Liquidamabar is a strange and compelling read. Give it a go."
3,tough class,"This class just about killed me. The book didn't coincide with the lectures, which is of course a professor issue, not a book issue. As a biology person I don't recommend taking Marine Biogeochem in your first semester of grad school"
1,A notable effort but incomplete,"Turnbull does a good job of detailing the Japanese and Korean aspects of this war but he almost totally ignores the Chinese who sent hundreds of thousands of soldiers to Korea. While Admiral Yi and his navy were certainly indispensable in cutting off Japanese supply lines, the Chinese armies were just as indispensable in besieging and rooting out the entrenched Japanese. In terms of sheer numbers, the Korean land forces were almost insignificant and their reliance on flails ineffective against the better armed Japanese. But yet Turnbull practically ignores the Chinese side and mentions maybe 2 Chinese generals by name while he details the various exploits of many Korean generals despite the fact that those exploits consist mainly of being slaughtered by the militarily more experienced Japanese. It's as if someone were to write a history of the 20th century Korean War and neglected to detail the Chinese side. Overall it's an interesting book but incomplete."
2,"Am I alone, here in the wilderness?","Do not judge this book by its cover.The highest praise I can offer A Working Girl Can't Win is to say that it's harmless. And I might have to revoke that, simply on the basis of the astronomically high sales of the benighted thing. There's nothing really WRONG with this poetry, save for the degree to which it rigorously avoids novelty of language or persuasive intellect or even intriguing moral introspection... it disturbs me that this off-handed narcissism is what so many readers find speaking to their present condition. Try some H.D. instead."
1,Not worth reading or buying,"Having read poetry all my life I was astounded to find that this book is recommended. It certainly made me feel sad that ""run of the mill trash"" is now getting into mainstream USA and getting away with it. I was incredibly dissapointed. The bitter tone of a frustrated women did not sit well with me."
1,This isn't even poetry!,"It's chopped up prose. Other than being well-networked, well-befriended by those in the NYC literari establishment, I cannot figure out why this book receieved the plaudits it had. The lines are more clumsy than a 16-year-old scrawling in the corners of her notebook; the subject matter is some kind of haute bourgeoise apologist thing that either I just don't get or I don't want to be a part of. Or maybe it's Mademoiselle articles, half-baked and dowsed with a little psychobabble. Ugh!!!!"
4,An argument for accessible poetry,"A poetry-lover, a student of the art, I cannot understand how so many readers have criticized this appealing little packet of verse for its sheer accessibility. For this is certainly the point of many of the more negative reader comments listed here. That this book may be classified as ""mainstream,"" that it can be read and enjoyed by the inhabitants of the non-academic world, and that it may even flow with prose-y, conversational lyricism appears to unnerve a few of those self-proclaimed purists still rattling around in their dusty ivory tower. Good news! Deborah Garrison is here to liberate you -- come out and smell the fresh air!"
1,"Uninspired, Pretty, and Cheap--Pretty Cheap","When I heard this woman read in NY, she displayed absolutely no confidence in her own voice, which makes me wonder how I, a reader, am expected to exert my own energy into the weak and facile language of her work. These poems lack authority. Most of the time I pictured a mousy woman afraid of her own shadow, throwing her voice like a stuttering ventriloquist because she was afraid to claim ownership of her own declarations. I pity those that think this constitutes ""sophistication."" What a disfavor to budding poets who will be misled into believing small efforts like these are publishable. Well, I guess they are. Jewell's book was even better than this!"
2,underbaked and flat,"Great idea for a collection--poems from the point of view of a female office worker. But there's not much empathy, not much risk, not much music, not much wit, not much anything here. These are above all intellectually and linguistically lazy poems which aim for irony but seldom get beyond archness. No perceptions you couldn't find in the pages of a woman's magazine or on a TV-show about working women--and not even as entertaining as any number of chick lit novels."
1,Fresh Air,"If Deborah Garrison is the one to liberate poetry from the ivory tower, as some readers suggest, then poetry's doomed. The true liberators far surpass her in wit, grace, and intellect: Dove, Walcott, Bei Dao to name a few--& you don't need to be an academic to notice this."
1,A Working Girl Can't Win,"One cannot help but wonder, if Deborah Garrison were not senior editor at The New Yorker would her jejune attempts at poetry ever have been noticed, much less published? Uggh. What a bunch of superficial, rhyme-y dime-y fluff. Good poetry marinates in one's marrow. Garrison's stuff (I won't dignify it with the name ""poetry"")floats like dust on a dingy supermarket tabloid rack. If she wants to vent her spleen in the wee hours, fine, but she should keep it to herself and not use her position to force it on others. Someone needs to say it, so I will, this emperor(ess) hath no clothes!"
2,Bulk-rate poetry?,"I wrote a review in Locust & Honey comparing the recent poetic work of Garrison's *Working Girl* and Suzanne Clark's *Sketches of Home* (Canon Press). An excerpt: ""How it feels to receive a bulk mailing which asserts that you have won a great prize or thousands of dollars is sometimes how Garrison's poetry comes across. We don't know if we should respond or if a response is even being solicited. This 'bulk-rate' poetry weighs heavy for an instant, then vanishes."" -- Adam Spurgeon Zens"
3,inside freemasonry?,"I was mislaid by the title wich showed inside freemasonry. It is in fact ""outside freemasonry"". The part wich I found to be very good is the general history surrounding freemasonry wich I entitled outside freemasonry because it's telling the story of how it has been influenced along the centuries. The deceiving part is that you will not learn about the rituals inside freemasonry or the beliefs wich are at the core of this religious or esoteric group. Definitely The Temple and the Lodge is a story wich begins with the Templars and ends with Freemasonry. You may link these two together but keep in mind this is but an hypothesis about the evolution of the Templars after they have been prosecuted in France."
2,Not a worthy successor to Holy Blood Holy Grail,"This is another offshoot of the commercially successful predecessor. The book traces the history of the knights templar and their supposed transformation into free masons. Much of the discussion focuses on free masonry, including its role in the American Revolution. I found the factual support lacking and the prose quite uninspired."
3,Not too bad. But too academic.,"I've been reading this book for sometime now.It's O. K., but not really to taste.The authors have lost too much time in Scotland.I will be back when I finish the book."
3,Burnt Alive,"This book examines the fact that the Knights Templars were at one point burnt alive at the stake accused of witchcraft. Goes up to the 1700s their history in masonry. Aleister Crowley's Order of Oriental Templars is the updated version of the Knights Templar and even their direct descendant. I skimmed through it looking for more info on their daily lives, which I guess means work."
3,Interesting idea...,but hard to follow and difficult to keep reading. To me the author never makes a true connection to show that the idea is plausable.
2,Read Holy Blood or Messianic legacy instead!!,This is a low point compared to their earlier alternative history books. Tired and dull compared to Holy Blood and Holy Grail or the Messianic Legacy.
3,"Imaginative, but inconclusive.","As a Master Mason I find books such as these to be, more often than not, complete fiction. This one has just enough historical truth in it to keep you reading. I feel that the authors focused on Scotland a bit much, but there were some interesting data that I was unaware of.Baigent and Leigh have a bit of a reputation for jazzing up history to make it more interesting... OK, that was putting it very nicely. I do not believe that they made up any of the facts, but the conclusions they sometimes draw could use a little help. I'd recommend this book to anyone that is mildly interested in either Freemasonry or the Knights Templar. ""Born in Blood"" is slightly more scholarly, if you wish to step up a notch. Not saying either are 100% true, but what is? The ""official"" history of Masonry is based partially on speculation also, Baigent and Leigh just have a more exciting speculation..."
4,How interesting...,"Baigent and Leigh create an interesting work here. Little did I know the involvement of Jacque de Molay, or the Knights Templar (historically) on modern day Freemasonry. This book is unlike the others that attempt to trace an absolute origin of Freemasonry; Baigent and Leigh simply offer ample suggestions with strong evidences behind its possible origin, and even throw in, although probably unkowingly, some political psychology in their thesis. This is a great book for the history buff."
1,Hmmm...,"The title would make you assume that the authors would link the Knight's Templar to Freemasonry. At times, there is a tenuous connection at best. The authors never seem to come to a solid conclusion based on their thesis. The last chapter itself is dedicated to Freemasonry in America, with absolutely no connections to the theme of their book. It was as if they said, we don't have enough pages let's through in a completely unconnected chapter. If you are looking for a book that does a good job of tying to the fraternity to the Knights Templar, try Born in Blood by John J. Robinson, a much better and well thought out book"
5,Angry with God,This is the first book which has addressed the spiritual problem I've been experiencing for over 3 years now. The authors use a most interesting format of sharing the personal story of Novotni's grandmother and then spinning off aspects of this story to apply to the reader's life. I've searched and searched for a book like this to no avail until I discovered Angry with God. It's given me the first glimpse of hope on how to reconnect with a God I thought either no longer cared or didn't even exist.
5,Mount works great,"This mount works easily, setting the screen at whatever position you choose. VERY solidly built, it holds our 70"" panel very securely to the stand."
3,not that bad,It's not the same as the songs from his other albums but if you like to listen to the music its not that bad.
5,Great workbook!,FIA is great because it is learning the language through immersion right into it. The workbook is very thorough with great exercises.
1,never received order.,ordered this product and never received it.dont know if it was the seller or amZon to blame but i feel i got ripped off. i am kind of scared to do anymore business with amazon as i cant afford to keep doing this. it has happened twice now.
4,Another Fielder Masterpiece,"For those of us who spend most of our time in this beautiful state cooped up in an office, Fielder takes us on yet another journey through the magnificent backcountry--this time in the dead of winter. But John's photos--as in all of his pieces--reflect more than what mother nature has to offer. They are equally as much a relection of his experience in capturing an essence lacking in so many expensive ""coffee"" table books. It is apparent that the photos were miticulously chosen and are a labor of love. If you, like myself, don't get ""out there"" as much as you would like, A Colorado Winter is a spectucular way to immerse yourself in another world. You will not be disappointed."
1,SAD,"As in Seasonal Affect Disorder. This book made me sad. Sad that Fielder has his own press and can publish anything HE feels is artistically passable and commercially viable. The best way to experience a colorado winter is to put this book down and get into the mountains. Fielder's colors can be beautiful, but he has little to no sense of composition. If you want a book for your coffee table, try Muench, or Goldsworthy, or Shinzo Maeda."
3,Needed a better script,"This was a so-so effort that is something that is great for the kids and presented all the basics of the 'Slayers' series in a fairly concise package. Still, I don't think the package was concise enough.One of the things I've liked about as much of the 'Slayers' series I've seen so far is that the episodes are all swiftly paced and tightly plotted. Gag follows upon gag upon fight scene... there's hardly ever a quiet moment. There were almost too many quiet moments in 'the Motion Picture.'The movie also failed to capitilize on some of the cooler elements that were introduced; wouldn't a bit more time spent in the past have been more interesting than beating up local thugs on the pier? I for one would have liked to learned more about the elves and the kid who appeared to be an ancestor of Gourry.I'll continue to work my way through the tapes of the half-hour episodes, though. I'm hooked on the insane adventures of Lina Inverse."
2,A sloppy Slayers product!,"What? How many Swords of Light are there? Two?! What's with this time lapse? Too lazy?! What the heck is going on?! I'm having a LOT of trouble understanding the plot. I understand how our favorite heroine gets mixed up in this but I don't understand about going back in time and the deal with this demon. Maybe dubbed versions are cut up by censors or maybe it was that other sorceress. Anyway, if you don't want to get confused, watch this first or not at all. That way the series will fix it."
2,Disappointing,"I found this movie to be a really big disappointment since I rather enjoy the Slayers TV series. None of the main characters besides Lina show up which will be disappointing to fans of Gourry, Zelgadis, and Amelia. The animation quality is better than the TV series but the movie just isn't very funny which is a big problem for a comedy (most of the jokes are comments about Lina's physique and they just aren't as funny as when it's Gourry making the comment) . You'd get more enjoyment out of watching one of the Slayers Next or Try DVDs."
3,It's OK,This movie is ok but it has a lot of problems. A lot of the movie is just plain too kidish to older viewers and to boring for younger viewers. I was kinda ... and was considering returning it (which i never do but was angry at the waste of money) while watching it. I just kept watching it and the ending was really good. The last 20 minutes were almost the only good part. This movie is more for younger viewers but really isn't because of it's boringness and the nudity in the credits. To sum it up give it a shot if there isn't anything better. If you get it and start to get disappointed just stick with it because the ending is pretty good.
3,Slayers? ADV Didn't do so well,I love almost all Slayers... But this one is the worst i've seen.. the dubbing is completely terrible and ADV didn't even get Ortiz. And the Change the Dragon Slave way to much. And Where did this other Sword of light come from? what happend to being only one?
2,Aahh the laughter,This movie is for all the people who can take naga. Though the art was cool none of the main characters cept lina(as is in most anime movies out in the USA) the only thing I realy liked was these little kawaii balls of goo that hop around. so if you can take Naga and aren't infatuated with one of the original characters then its a good movie.
2,"A good quality movie, but fairly childish","Slayers does have good animation and good dialogue, but you can tell by the way the characters act that this movie was made for children. For a children's movie it's great, but if you want a good fantasy movie look elsewhere."
4,"Great, but not what i quite expected.","For someone who has never seen anything to do with the Slayers and then seeing this movie is pretty weird, i wasn't expecting an extremly funny anime about a young sorceress who saves a island with the hopes of bigger breasts! All in all it's great, funny, but not something that you would watch in front of your mom. This is because of the previews for animes with cutey honey (if you've ever seen this then you know what i mean.) Also Nagha's laugh is so annoying! Buy this, but don't watch with the old folks."
4,"Good, but not as good as it could have been","Slayers the Motion Picture, the first of the Slayers movies, is quite good. Though ADV couldn't get Ortiz to play the part of Lina in the English version, the new Lina is quite good. The only thing that keeps me from giving a five star rating is ADV's rewriting, that is, the renaming of a spell name that was already in English in the original Japanese and inserting references to other work that was not originally present. The subtitled version has many of the same problems, though does a little better.But, this is only worth one star off. The rest of the movie, the quality of the dub acting, and the humor make up for shortcomings in the translation, assuming that Naga doesn't scare you off."
4,A pretty darn good movie,"'Slayers: The Motion Picture' is an anime film with a lot of qualities: Excellent animation, good humor and main characters that are quite detailed. It starts out a little slow and childish, but if you stick with the film the whole way through, you find it gets better and better. After seeing this video, I set forth on a mission to find and collect all the Slayers videos that I can. Great show!"
3,No big deal.,"I'm happy to say that Slayers has well-rounded characters, good dubbing, and excellent animation. Not so happily I say that the plot itself is uninteresting and the fight scenes are cheap and predictable. Almost every battle begins and ends with a single spell being cast. The only interesting things were these: The three jelly-like creatures, Naga's lack of clothing, the dragon whose body was completely out of proportion with its head, the awesome closing theme, and the Spring of Growth. Slayers is a very popular series so it wouldn't be wise to go by just one opinion, but it didn't do much for me."
4,GOOD MOVIE,"This movie not only introduced us a charcter that we haven't seen before(Naga), but gave us a glimps of the history of sword of light before it was in the hands of the great Gourry. I enjoyed the movie, it was funny, like all Slayers should be."
5,Dee-lishus,"Great taste. Goes well with chicken, pork, fish. It's not a substitute for mango chutney, but it is a great alternative when you want some variety."
5,beautiful music that permeates your heart and soul.....,"This album is one of the latest and greatest in my Latin music collection. Leonel Garcis and Noel Schajris have a gorgeous, lyrical quality to their harmonies, and their fusion of r&b;, hip hop and Latin elements will have you hooked. Some of my favorite cuts on the album include ""Que Me Alcance La Vida"" (a stunning ballad!), ""No Voy"" (a more uptempo song with a beat reminscent of old school Michael Jackson), and ""Junto a Ti"" (a hip hop inspired beat with Puerto Rican rapper, Vico C).This album is a great introduction to this marvelous musical duo. They have a romanticism that is very rare in today's music scene, and are definitely worthy of MUCH more exposure in the United States. I hope this album brings them a Grammy (and not just a Latin one!!!). I look forward to hearing much more from these guys in the future."
3,"Nice, but could have been better.","I LOVE Sin Bandera. What I love about them is the smooth, creamy way their two voices swirl through R&B harmonies with beautiful Spanish lyrics. However, this CD, Manana, let me down a little. The second thing I loved about Sin Bandera WAS the purity of their music. No profanity, no filth. No nasty, explicit songs I (as a Christian) feel the need to skip over on the CD. This CD has 2 such songs. WHY?! I know reggaeton is the most popular thing going right now, but Sin Bandera was doing fabulously with at least 2 hugely successful, clean albums. Why did you have to take your music into the gutter, guys? The rest of Manana is nice. I love the duet with Brian McKnight, and even the 2 versions of Junto a Ti (although they are sanitized reggaeton) are a nice change of pace. Sin Bandera if you are reading this, don't sell out your fan base trying to fit in with the ""cool kids"". Stick to what you do best, and you can have the best of both worlds."
1,One of the worst books about Mary I've read,"This book completely misses the point on Mary and is highly disrespectful of the gospel. After about 1/3 of the way through, I had to throw it in the trash (where it belongs)."
1,rotor came with rust on it out of the box,"enough said....this rotor had spots of rust all over the damn thing right out of the box and looked dirty almost as if it had been previously used. i ordered my front rotors from a gm dealer because they were sold out on amazon and thank goodness i did because atleast my front rotors look brand spankin new and clean and i am extremely disappointed with this order and it has lowered my respect for amazon.com i will not be ordering automotive products from them again. i don't have the time money or resources to spend returning the damned thing, so what i plan to do is use a wirebrush to scrape off as much rust as possible, use brake cleaner to clean the rotor off so it atleast appears like new, and paint it myself, because lets not forget, the picture depicted of this product is painted. and let me tell you, when i got my rotor it was anything but painted..... false advertisement and a bad buying experience"
5,"Well Made, Durable","As is the case with most other Bucket Boss products, this is a well-made, sturdy bag that keeps jumper cables in their place under the seat in the back of my pickup truck. The bag has held up well over the past five years as I am invariably called on to lend the cables for a jump start at least four to five times per year. There is also enough room in the bag - even with 4-gauge cables - for a pair of safety glasses, pliers, a battery terminal brush, among other items."
5,Good bag for jumper cables,I can say that I am very happy with the bag as I bought it to carry a set of the Michelin 5100 cables that have the large box to protect from reversed hook-up for my wife's car. It was pretty easy getting the cable set into the bag and it stows away nicely in her spare tire area. With the Michelin cables though there really isn't much room for anything else in the bag. Still it is a good bag for jumper cables that either didn't come with a bag or have fallen apart.
2,It could not make it for one day.,"The bag is really good looking. I'd say it's sturdy and it would protect your jumper cables or any other tools you may want to put in. For my surprise, as soon as I put my cables inside the bag and tried to close the zipper, I noticed that the latter was not able to close the bag at all, as it came with a small opening on the starting end, causing the zipper to open again.I'm sending the bag to change or fix the zipper at a local shop as I think this will be less painfull than returning the item, explain and then wait for a replacement (and then, hoping that it comes in working conditions)."
2,Oversized and ugly,"I was hoping for something that would hold the jumper cables compactly, but this bag is much bigger than need be. And it doesn't look like the picture. I think I'll return it for those reasons."
1,NOT IMPRESSED,I DON'T THINK THIS BAG IS WORTH THE $14+ PRICE. IT IS SMALLER & NOT AS STURDY LOOKING AS I EXPECTED.
2,Pay attention,"Ok, I admit I should have paid a little closer attention, but beware. There are NO jumper cables with this. This is merely an overpriced BAG. I suppose if you really like to keep your jumper cables in a heavy duty bag, maybe this is for you, but if that is the case, you may be using your jumper cables too much. Let's be honest, your hope is to never use these things and if you do, you dont need them stored in some expensive bag collecting dust.Oh by the way, this item CAN NOT BE RETURNED. So pay attention here and hopefully you are smarter than I am."
2,Too Small,"This bag is of very good quality but although it might be considered the standard size, the Die Hard cables which I bought at Sears will not fit so I ended up returning the bag. I compared my cables with another brand my wife has and the Die Hard were almost twice as long and not as flexible due to the high quality so they are harder to coil.I agree with other reviewers in that you really couldn't fit much on the side pockets."
4,Cover up your Jump!,"Great Bag for protecting and keeping you Jumper CablesClean and neat. Really handy if you own averageJumper cables you pick up at the Big Box Stores.But if you own a Commercial set (2 Gauge) the Bag is a littlebit of a tight fit.Great construction, built very strong and sturdy.You cant go wrong with this Bag!!"
5,bucket boss jumper cable bag,i have 2 one for jumper cables snd one in my rv for the water hose. bought another one for my daughter. handy item.
4,Good stuff,"This is a great item. However, I found it a bit small in diameter for a set of serious cables."
2,very small,much smaller than expected. this will only hold the shortest and thinnest of cables. bag is well made but anything longer than 12-15 of thin cables will not fit inside. 4ga cables of anything longer than 10-12' aren't going to work with this bag.disappointed with this one. not worth the return so i will find something else to use it with.
4,excellent bag,I use this bag to store a tow rope in my pickup. I like the material it's made of and feels like it will wear really well. Would like to buy another some day because it can be useful in storing any number of items.
4,jumper cable bag,This bag is a great value. It is perfect for tight areas in all cars or trucks. Works well and is compact.
1,Too small,"I purchased the Bucket Boss model 06009 jumper cable bag based on reviews that said it could hold a heavy duty set of jumper cables. WRONG! This bag is definitly smaller than I anticipated. It might hold a set of short, cheap, lightweight cables, but there is no way that my heavy duty cables will fit. It might be good for a 50 foot extension cord, but that's about it. The Bucket Boss model 06100 bag might do the job since it appears to be larger, but check before you buy. Since mine only cost about $11, it isn't worth the hassle of returning. I'm sure I'll find some use for it."
2,There must be a better collection than this ...,"I have two major complaints about this collection: (1) The primary singer (a baritone) sounds American ... perhaps he's not ... but it's not quite the authentic English pub experience I was after! (2) Some of the music sounds more like German pub music ... All in all, I'd pass on this one and keep looking ... although the song selection is good."
4,hope beyond the concentration camp,This is a memoir that is easier to read than many about experiencing Nazi Germany. Nonetheless it expresses the experience quite fully. I think it is appropriate for adolescents on up. I bought it for my elderly aunt who was interested in exploring the Holocaust in a prayerful way.
1,Not A Very Good Recording,"I received a copy of this cd free at the show which my parents dragged me to. The cd itself is not of very good quality even for a live recording. It also is amazing how much this cd is going for on Amazon. This cd was available brand new with shipping at the official Society of Seven website for an amount much less than what it is being priced at here. I am not a fan of the Society of Seven as I find their act to be rather corny. I wouldn't go out and purchase one of their albums if they came out with one. They are exclusively a cover band. If you are interested in a local Hawaii act who has an album that is worth purchasing, you should try The Krush's Best of The Krush. They performed original material and did not rely on glitter or show like the aforementioned group. And their albums are much more reasonably priced here."
2,uninspiring and unattractive,"When I found the deck in bookstore, it really spoke to me, but when i actually saw the cards i was very dissapointed. I found the images dark and unattractive, and this made it very unpleasant to read."
2,So boring...,"A Region-4 DVD produced under a title ""Heaven's Pond"" makes a related info of harder to locate in Amazon.com.However, one could conclude psychopathic nature of characters is based on a sort of ill imagination demonstrated by creators of this work rather than on any realistically possible patterns.As understood, a young husband is a person assuming someone's identity which presses him to survive on an island in the middle of the river, which is practically impossible, no food and elementary gains civilization presents. In this case, his marriage, no documents, is a mystery either.While wasting time on watching, I felt this work very similar to a famous French movie ""Criminal Lovers"", a real gem of a modern cinematography."
2,Nothing to really speak of...,"Boring..that is what I would have to call this one. There was very little action, little suspense. Ending was nothing to really speak of either. Kinda predictable to say the least. Dialouge in this one was very limited. I was looking for something to grab me, it never did."
4,"I Swam in it, and it was too warm..and fuzy","I watched this movie without any high expectations, due to the fact that Artisian has been releasing some horrible movies. I have always considered Tara Reid a good actress, and the same for Kip Pardue.This movie started off with out any suspenceful moments, and was replaced with warm and fuzy momemnts. Their dialogue was way too corny. But as the tenseful moments ebgan to arise, they over flooded the screen, and didn't stop until the end.The ""twist"" was a little predictibale, and was a little too basic and boring. But what made me rate this movie this way was because IT WAS WAY TOO CORNY!!!"
3,Disc was somewhat scratched.,Disc plays ok...a little scratched. would hesitate a little during play. But all and all it was fine. Thank you.
4,Great For A Lifetime Movie!,"I first saw this movie on Lifetime, and my mom and I got so into it that we skipped our plans that night to finish watching it. Kip Pardue is unusally sexy as a serious psychopath, and Tara Reid even gets a little bit annoying as his hostage. It's really an enjoyable movie, enough to make me buy it. If you like thrillers and you like Lifetime movies, you'll love this."
1,Pardue and Reid get lost in a dull thriller,"Newlyweds, Kip Pardue (The Rules Of Attraction, Driven) and Tara Reid (American Pie 1 and 2, Urban Legend) go on a 2 week vacation to a secluded cabin in the middle of a lake that is owned by Pardue and his family. But there is a reason why Pardue is keeping Reid there, that is because she has a fear of water, Hydrophobia and it seems like Pardue has some control issues as we find out he's been stalking her for some time. Reid tries everything possible to escape but her pyschotic new hubby wont let her leave the little island. The two actors babble and fight but their acting abilities in this are drained with no excitment whatsoever and it gets kinda boring after awhile like Cabin Fever with no Fever in it at all. Also starring Meredith Baxter who is only in the beginning."
2,"an ok book, but not exceptional","If you've never rebuilt a carter carb, this book may be Ok. If your looking for jet sizes used on OEM applications, or tricks to make your thermoquad, etc run even better...this book has nothing to offer. No venturi size comparison, no metering rod or jet sizing, no suggestions for compensating for altitude, etc. The little sheet of paper that comes with most carb kits will give you the same set up info as this book, and its ""free"" with the carb kit."
2,Too simplistic and repetitive,"This book says the same 3 things over and over again: no one can MAKE you angry, anger is a natural feeling, and you have the power to control your anger. All this is well and good, but it doesn't go more in depth than that. I found this book and its ""solutions"" rather trite."
5,An obscure work but a good one,"Although the lesser known works of authors are usually lesser known for a reason, this one is a hidden gem. It is a good adventure about explorers in Africa who come upon a semi-civilized population of ape-men. Inspired by Darwin, it was an amusing story and far more interesting than many of Verne's novels."
4,Solid Fiction,"Great premise, and Walker has a solid prose style. The suspense level wasn't fulfilled for me, however. The ending of Titanic 2012 was not a surprise, unfortunately. Still worth reading. Would have liked more historical detail of original Titanic ship."
5,A little early to rate!,"I am leaving April 6, 2012, to journey to Southampton and board the ""Balmoral"" (old Royal Cruise Line) on Sunday, April 8, 2012, for the commemorative cruise of the 100th Anniversary of the Titanic tragedy. I'm purchasing this book to read on the flight over. Sounds like easy and fascinating reading.Will review when I return."
5,One of the best fiction books of the year.,"""Titanic 2012"" gets my vote as one of the best fiction books of the year. My guess is that most readers have mixed feeling about the ""Titanic phenomenon""-- we're fascinated but also getting a little tired of it. What else is there to say? I was amazed and intrigued by the ingenius spin that author Bill Walker put on his story. The novel pulls you in from the start and just keeps getting better. Kudo's to Mr. Walker for a great book."
2,Cashing in on Cameron's Titanic,"This is another fast book cashing in on the response to Cameron's Titanic, although who can blame the author, particularly as he's so honest about his homage... A good 'holiday read', if you don't mind a silly plot, shallow characterisation and a story that plays fast and loose with history. If so, you'll probably think this book ok for a momentary diversion. And that's about it. If you want to read excellent Titanic fiction, try Beryl Bainbridge's 'Every Man For Himself'. For an introduction to the real Titanic, read Walter Lord's seminal work 'A Night To Remember'."
2,Where is the rest of the story??,The story was a good book but was quickly ruined by a terrible ending. It felt like the author didn't know how to finish the story so he just didn't. Don't bother buying this book unless you like stories that end abruptly and without any real finish or conclusion.
4,Missing links,"I thought the book was great. I love the portraits in the rooms of the original passengers and all the detail down to the china and even the workout rooms. I also enjoyed the banter among the Harvard grads. It did seem a bit rushed though, and I dont know if that was the authors intention to mimic the urgency of the story's interviews/book or not, but we jumped from Trevor exploring the ship to being best friends with the captain, from just seeing Maddy to being in love with her, and some of the dialogue was flat and forced, like the author might have been trying too hard to come up with something to fill the gaps. There could have been some headlines after the explosion too, something that would make Trevor and his buddies really absorb what happened, like maybe in the end they could have been sitting around the club reading about the voyage on the front page of the NY Times. That would been a chilly dejavu."
3,i liked it,"Well, I do NOT play the rpgs, sorry so I can't tell you how this relates to that, but from an outsider's pov this was an interesting foray into another magical world. I don't think one should read this by it's self, rather read this in one sitting with the other two books."
2,Nice car show.,"But there isn't anything X rated like the advertisement says, so you get a low score today, so you get a low score for today."
4,Pancho Barnes Doco,"""Pancho Barnes and the happy Bottom Riding Club"" is a very informative but low key documentary. Pancho Barnes had an amazing life and this film tells you all about it. I heartily recommend it to anyone interested in aviation."
4,Great Flick for Aviation Buffs,"We showed The Legend of Pancho Barnes and the Happy Bottom Riding Club to an audience of our local chapter of the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA)for our 3rd Annual Outdoor Movie Night. It was fantastic! Very entertaining and informative. At first, I thought it would be a dull documentary type movie but it was funny and engaging all along, with plenty of flying and airplane visuals. Great flick for an aviation audience."
1,Horrible,The author couldn't even make his high school basketball team. How can he write a book about basketball when he doesn't even know how to play?
4,"Good book, good speaker","I heard Shandler speak at a convention in San Francisco in March. He's a down-to-earth, approachable guy and I enjoyed hearing about the origins and inspiration of his book. Coaching Ira ain't Hemingway, but it is a funny, quick, enjoyable read that I finished on two short plane trips. I especially liked the exciting conclusion -- a championship game between the USY team and the Orthodox champion. Despite the intensity of the moment, humor was dropped in throughout. Would make a great movie, with someone like Friends' David Schwimmer in the lead role!"
1,Editor Needed,"This book has a cute idea and some clever quips, but it is unfortunate proof that anyone can be a published author. Before tackling another writing project, the author should find an editor, or at least a software program to correct his spelling, grammar, and syntax. The book is almost unreadable."
5,House Made of Stone,"I had read a book similar to this one before, but it wasn't written very well so I wasn't able to form a real connection with the woman telling her story. Gina's story however was so well written that I couldn't put this book down once I got started!I don't want to say to much about this book other than this is a really good one!"
3,Little Pim Spanish pack,So far both of my kids enjoy watching Little Pim and I do hear them reapeating a lot of the Spanish. Especially my 2 year old daughter. I like these movies very much. The only down side I find is the length of the videos. For 45 dollars they could have given you at least 45 minutes to an hour on each video. I do think they are over priced for their movies.
4,cute and educational,"I borrowed this product from my local library and decided almost immediately to purchase it for my son. It also refreshes my memory and teaches me some new words and uses as well, great for improving the Spanish in my Spanglish speaking home.Little Pim: 3-Pak (Spanish for kids)I plan on purchasing more DVD's in the future."
5,perfect,Love the short episodes and little Pims gorgeous voice. My 16 month old has never watched tv and is not usually interested but this held his attention for the right amount of time and encourages interaction.
1,"""BLANK, BLANKETY,BLANK""","I HAD THIS IN RECORD FORM, PROBABLY WHEN IT WAS FIRST PUBLISHED. WHO KNOWS WHERE IT IS NOW. PETE FOUNTAIN IS A FANTASTIC JAZZ CLARINETIST. I WAS REALLY EXCITED TO GET THIS CD, AND VERY DEVASATED WHEN I TRIED TO PLAY IT. THE CD WAS COMPLETELY BLANK. ON TOP OF THAT, AMAZON WONT SEND A REPLACEMENT ONLY A REFUND. THAT SUCKS."
1,Didn't work,"We hooked this up and it worked for a day although we wern't happy with the picture. I thought maybe I could adjust it but the next day we had sound and no picture. We tried everything to try and get the picture back but even the DVD wouldn't work. It may have been something we changed by mistake but not only was there nothing to be found in the instruction book but no phone number to call for help. Thank goodness for Amazon. We returned it and within a few weeks had a full refund, including the return shipping. We finally went to Best Buy so we could look at the actual picture and bought one we were satisfied with. (Amazon didn't have the model we liked.) I would recommend that if you are going to buy a TV, particularly LCD, to check it out in person and see if you can order it from Amazon. There seems to be a lot of variation in picture quality, especially in the smaller size."
3,Auspicious Beginning!,"This is a suprise for me.This was kind of a good album i can say.I bought this album not really kno wing what i was getting into all i knew was that roselyn is an actress and a very sexual kind of person and that is the appeal that comes forth with this album.I loved her in boat trip which made me want this album.This album not your ordinary pretty face girl album.This album has some credibility to it.Her low sexy voice compliments the sexy lyrics.Her flavor is so diiferent.There is your pop song not songs on this album she has some salsa,bablada mostly which are really good.HIghlights of thi salbum are Amor Amor(salsa version)Suavecito,noche de verano and a few others i recommend this album to any fans of mollified latin music and she indeed in a facile way captures a sade mood.GO Roselyn"
1,First time reviewer,"I just used this product for the second time with helping my husband who was in an accident severing all tendons in his foot/leg)to bathe.The legs began to bend and it's now no longer useable. I don't see wherea weight limit is listed but while my husband is overweight, I would think that this seat would have held his 253 lbs - but it didn't. So beware. If the person this is intended for weighs near that, don't buy this product!"
5,Teenage Life,"Teenage LifeYours Truly Skye O'shea by Meagan Shull is a book about a young teenager. Skye just started [...]. She is trying to juggle sports, boys, and school all at the same time. When things get tough she writes to her favorite hockey player. She gives Skye helpful advice. I would recommend it to [...] girls and up.Skye loves playing hockey but she is stuck in the shadow of her sisters legacy. She is trying to make the Ithaca 15U girls hockey team. Mean while, she starts to fail math, so her dad gets a touter. Then she meets Ashton, she thinks he is the most sweetest nicest boy she has ever met. Everyday after school they would walk to the library together. Everything was going good, maybe possibly, he liked her? But you never know what could happen! You will just have to read the book and see!To sum it all up this book is truly a good book and teenage girls will love it , just like I do."
3,Carson (not) Country,"If you like Carson fine,if your buying because of the title don't be mislead,small percentage is actually country"
2,Not Best Of Carson,I own the whole set of Johnny Carson DVD's. This one has to be the biggest disappointment of all. Save your money.
5,go buy this album now!,"The Acoustic Roots cd is probably the best compilation of acoustic songs on one album ive heard since Sublime's Acoustic Brad Nowell and Friends cd. It is the first cd I ever listened to from Slightly Stoopid and it definitely made me a fan instantly. It has that positive vibe that can only be heard in the west coast. Miles and Kyle are a perfect match for eachother; they compliment each other's talents. And with the songs being live, it reminds me of Brad Nowell's insanely beautiful live acoustic songs. Please go out and buy this album for the sake of humanity."
4,A beautiful opera with some unforgettable scenes...,"Remember the scene at the opera in the movie Life is Beautiful, it was the enchanting and famous Barcarlle from this opera. Gorgeous melodies await you, such as the stunning ""Doll Song"", where the soprano is a lovely doll who needs to be wound (you'll hear a mechanical winding noise) in order to continue singing...The famous ""Legend of Kleinzach""...This is great music. If you're okay with a 1965 quality recording, then go for it! And this performance captures the lovely French style quite well. The opera booklet only includes a synopsis explaining the tracks but has no biographical info about Offenbach and no historical info about this opera."
2,Tiny digital numbers,"CASIO MARINE GEAR EDIFICE WATCH W/ METAL BAND BLACK MRP700D-1APROS: Stylish,rugged appearance,light strong enough to illuminate theface,10 year battery (don't have to worry to change battery at least for 7 years).CONS: The band is too large. Impossible to adjust. It seems it was madefor large or chubby wrists.You can barely see the digital time and date.My advise: Get another model with larger digital time and date."
5,Direct box review,"We wanted to increase the sound quality of stringed instruments in our Irish band. We purchased 3 Direct Boxes and they have really done the job, increased our sound and improved it.The Vendor got them to us in avery short time, and we were pleased with the protective packaging."
1,Not acceptable,Tops of cover severely scored and pages stuck together. Images poorly or insufficiently inked. Text excellent.
5,Close to perfection!,"That book is everything I wanted. The style is neither pretentious nor wordy - the easy, flowing style ideal for a light, happily romantic story - yet it is precise and elegant as well (especially the dialogues, both subtle and witty). As to the characters, they're all coherent and quite loveable (with the exception of Julian the Antagonist, exquisitely loathsome). As to the smutty parts, they were just delightful.If you purchase only one gay romance on this site, this should - must - be it. I wish there were more work of such quality in this category."
5,The Price of Temptation,"I loved this book, I got caught up in the characters, if could feel what they were feeling. I couldnt put it down once I started to read it, I loved the ending but hated to see it end as a matter of fact. I am hoping there is a follow up to it, I would like to say how their lives progress and the improvement in the relationships between the characters.to the auther keep writting, love your book."
5,Good item,"Nice item to have on hand, it alows you to see when the water has stopped flowing on yur RV sewer line. The downward angle also helps relive stree on the hose and plumbing."
4,see what you dump,I needed to be able to know when my black tank was empty. This was the best way to obtain this information. It fits in my cargo hold and I can always tell when its clean.
3,"Visionary, evocative yet slightly self-absorbed","Gregory Corso is one of the lesser known original Beat poets. His poetry commands just as much attention as his more popular peers Ginsberg and Kerouac. This collection is from the mid-70's and the pieces are, granted, emotive, visionary, acutely real but also obscure like only a Beat could be. Corso does have a clever lyrical gift and the ability to inspire despite his elitist tendencies. Personally, i suggest it as an afternoon read."
5,Quality at a Bargain.,"This is my second NS-C444. I had one many years prior but sold the initial one along with a pair of NS-555 Floor speakers to pay for a examination fee. Missing it and how great the sound it reproduced, I needed to get me that Yamaha center speaker to rebuild a 7.1 AV system for my home theater. Currently due to space considerations, I have (3) pairs of the NS-333 and the center NS-C444. Awaiting my decision for the YST-SW315 subwoofer in the extraordinary piano black finish or the less expensive black ash finish. All is powered by a Pioneer VSX-1021K, 7.1 x 110 watts, I believe. I do miss the NS-555's towers however, they were damaged cosmetically in a move from SoCal to NW Florida. With a larger accommodations I may acquire the 555's or possibly the larger 777's . Yamaha speakers are sonically exceptional to me."
4,Pleased but surprised,The Center speaker arrived today and I just wanted to look at it to ensure there was no damage. The box says the speaker is Nior Black which should mean it should be the almost flat stain type finish but when I opened the box it was the piano finish(super shinny). Other than that the speaker was 100%. It doesn't match the other speakers I have but I'll not be returning it just because of the finish. It's black and that is what is important. I like the size of the drivers and the center mounted tweeter/horn. I have a complete set of Yamaha NS-6490 bookshelf speakers and a SW-216 sub woofer and I just needed the center to finish out a complete system I have stored for future use. Sound is clear and clean. After testing I re boxed it and placed it with the other components.
4,Good value speaker,"Excellent reproduction and good load capacity make this a great choice for the budget conscious. Speakers are the most important part of your sound system, so don't short change yourself, but you don't have to overspend for no reason, either. I am very happy with this product. Fit and finish are excellent, too."
1,If dimensions are important...,"I purchased this speaker based on the reviews, and based on the quoted dimensions. I built a media center, and had a very specific criteria for the center speaker (had to be less than 16.25"" wide). The specs on this speaker looked right. However, when the speaker arrived, it was too large. It might be a great speaker, but what's the point of quoting dimensions if they aren't accurate? Now I have to send it back, and hope the next one I select has accurate dimensions quoted in the description. It shouldn't be this hard."
4,The Presence of Spain,"Jan Morris (who also wrote under the name James Morris) is a fantastic travel writer - really the best - and this is an outstanding early 1964 book of hers, with magnificent photos and captions. (A later 1979 version of the book, with a similar title, Spain, omits the photos and updates the text, but I think the photos are very helpful in experiencing the book.)"
1,Simply Horrid!,"What a lousy work! Talk about amateurish, boring, and pessimistic. There are kindergartners who could make better poetry. Why did I waste any time and energy on this?! This was like sniffing limburger. So angry and unenligtening and tedious, why would poetry lovers even go here!? I'm sticking to Essex Hemphill, Maya Angelou, Audre Lorde, and many other fine poets. But this mess!? No way! Talk about not doing the trick and failing miserably!"
3,maybe too mature..?,"I have to say that I was disappointed by the poetry in this collection. I thought I would like to write poetry and i wanted to read more about the lesbian lifestlye. All of the poems did not relate to lesbians, and the stly of writing did nothing for me. Possibly, I am not cultured enough or old enough to enjoy it."
5,One word says it all: Powerful,"Super powerful. All I can say is wow. I have been going through about 3 shredders per year for almost 10 years now, mostly low-end 4-8 sheet shredders for $59 or less. This thing cuts through EVERYTHING and doesn't miss a beat. Just get a box of shredder lubricant sheets to run through once a day if you use it alot. I think they make it happy.I've had it less than a week, but if it's consistent and early use is any indication, this one may last a few years."
3,Three stars is a gift to this plodding snooze,"I don't want anyone to be deluded by a five-star review that calls this plodding 'Emperor' passionate. Leaving aside the listless finale, where Knappertsbusch loses all energy and the pianist must fall back on note-spinning, the overal thrust of Curzon's reading is elegant and gentle. In other words, there's no thrust at all. He's a lovely pianist in many works, but his inwardness is ill-suited to Beethoven. The opening few bars are promising, and Knappertsbusch isn't totally asleep at the wheel. There's poetic phrasing from Curzon in the slow movement, when he can retreat into is own world. Otherwise, this dull recording, in equally dull sound, is a misfire."
1,Where's Tortelvis ?,"I'm a big fan of Dread Zeppelin from their first album (Un-Led-Ed 1990) and still love the great fun reggae versions of Led Zep tunes fronted by the big Elvis impersonator ""Tortelvis"".BUT, this CD is something entirely different - all new recordings. Very modern electronic sounds with pedestrian vocals. I feel misled (pun intended)."
1,A grave disappointment,"Insipid. That's about all I can say. Interesting idea, boring execution. What makes it worse is the genius of earlier Dread Zeppelin albums, and the fact that this is being marketed as a ""best of"" album. It's not, and people should stick to older Dread albums that showcase Tortelvis and the crew when they don't sound like they're heavily sedated."
3,"""Whole Lotta Love"" or ""The Lemon Song""?","Sacrilege to some, definitely not everybody's cup of tea, but I love it. 11 interesting adaptations of Led Zeppelin, plus two original compositions. Clearly, not all of it works, but sometimes I think they actually managed to outdo an original. It's all very novel - clearly, there's nobody else out there anything like these guys."
2,Meyers' biography of F. Scott Fitzgerald,"I found Jeffrey's Meyers' biography of F. Scott Fitzgerald dismaying. Not that Meyers' doesn't write well (he does), or capture the essence of Fitzgerald's dissipation, but the book seemed a deliberate hack job. It is largely a continuous stream of references to Fitzgerald's obstinacy, egotism, inferiority, outrageousness, drunkenness and worse. I don't know where anyone got the idea that Meyers' wrote with any compassion in this biography. This work only makes Fitzgerald look pathetic. Of course, in many ways he was...but I see no scholarly effort to recognize the quality and enduring value of much of his work. While they pull few punches themselves, I'd recommend Mizener's The Far Side of Paradise, and Bruccoli's Some Sort of Epic Grandeur for a more balanced perspective."
4,Patho by the pound,This book weighs so much you cannot really read it. The content if very dense and through. The internet connection is fun and useful for learning/reviewing information. The internet has great links for further information and resources.
3,Peaked at 6 and started declining at 7 & *,"It started going downhill in S7 when scott caan was given a role as ""one of the gang"" --- not quite sure how he got the gig but he must be buds with Mark Wahlberg or something. It just did not feel true to life that someone like that would just waltz into the crew and be accepted and in S8 it got worse. 2 late 20 somethings take over a major talent agency from a lifetime industry veteran. The writers were getting lazy at this point.Then adding Andrew Dice Clay into the mix was just laughable - I guess again Mr Wahlberg was just doing this sad old freak a favor!Overall a great series and if you watched the first 6 by all means watch the last 2 but be warned the writers got lazy and watching scott caan is painful !"
3,Everyone's already checked out,"This was the last and weakest season, however, they still made me laugh. So sad Diceman did not play a more comedic role. I miss the ""old"" Diceman."
2,Out of gas,This series should have ended after season 6. I love the characters and will probably go to the movie just to see them again.
3,"Not with a bang, but a whimper","With all due respect to T.S. Eliot, but that best describes my impression of this final season. After years of angst between E and Sloan, suddenly they decide they're right for each other. After years of Vince having short and long-term affairs with countless women, in two episodes he finds his true love, and in one episode Ari walks away from his multi-million dollar business as the only way to save his marriage, and they all just fade into the sunset and hop on luxury private jets. I expected better."
5,old school,"this is one of the finest surf films of that wonderful era in surfing. You can put it on and listen to the music, while watching the surfing. there is no narration. great soundtrack, and shot by one of the best camera guys in the business. restored to the best quality from the first generation film."
1,Innermost Limits of Boredom,"My memory of this film, seen only once and nearly 40 years ago at that, is entirely unmatched with my present viewing. I thought the Pink Floyd track, ""Echos,"" was on this! Anyway, I found this to be a fine HOME movie, a nostalgic novelty, but in the main pretty boring. Yawn."
3,"Useful, however . . .","I bought this book because I want to learn how to pray. Now, it definately explains all about praying in an Orthodox shul, and explains purpose and history about the various prayers for home, but as for reading it straight through, I couldn't do it. I got bored in the minute details. One thing I noticed is that, being totally from an Orthodox perspective, it explains common practices during prayer, but barely touches on the fact that he is referring specifically to men,as women cannot make up a minyan, the group of ten needed to pray. But aside from that, a very useful resource."
4,Jewish Prayer,An excellent book for Jew or Messianic believer in understanding the tradition for prayer in the synagogue.
5,One of the most useful books in learning about services,"I have to honestly say this is one of the best books that I have picked up recently on Judism. The book is clear, concise, and explains services, prayers, and why services are the way the are. This book explains so much, I wished I had picked this book up a long time ago. I love that this book contains explanation behind all aspects of services, and prayers that are said on a daily basis. I highly recommend picking up this book."
3,RF Hash,"Power supply works ok but emits too much RF broadband noise (hash). It did hold up with a 200W RF amplifier (20 Amps) and a 25W radio (4 Amps) with no problem. Depending on your configuration, this power supply needs to be filtered on the output to reduce RFI into nearby receivers."
4,Some feedback,"Nice sturdy power supply. I bought it to hook up a car amp inside my house and i gotta say that i am disappointed because the current has a lot of feedback and creates static hissing sound, which does not happen when hooked up to a battery. I think if i hook it up to a battery with diodes, it will remove the noise though, so i give 4 stars."
5,Power supply,"Overall a nice power supply for the money, I picked it up @ $65 on amazon.It works great for the RC hobbyist with Hyperion chargers and Lipo batteries being thats what i use it for, the fan does run continuosly regardless of what Pyramid says but thats fine.....otherwise its a nice unit"
4,Fine so far,"Bought this to power a Kenwood 900W class D mono car subwoofer amp that powers a 1000W continuous 12"" Pioneer sub; as part of a Home Theater system. Was not using the sub/amp in car anymore & needed one for new HT system. Has worked fine for it's purpose & I have worked the sub pretty hard & no over-amp shutdown yet. The amp is fused at 60A, so I had my reservations. Since a sub in a HT system connected as Low Frequency Effects channel, it only sees high signal levels for short periods. Also the dual voice coil sub speaker is set for 4ohms, so amp is producing only 500W max. I haven't tried the AV reciever's tuner yet to see if there is any radio frequency interference. I'll update if it does."
1,Siggggghhhh,"This unit has sat in my workshop since I purchased it a couple of months ago that is where it belongs. In the workshop, in the original shipping box and ready to ship back to whoever built this piece of junk.I set this unit up to power a 40 watt 2 meter rig a couple of days ago. Not too difficult of a task to ask of it. Problem is as long as I am using this power supply, and other RF devices are wiped out by it. The interference from this Pyramid power supply cases a S9 ++ level of interference on 75/80 and 40 meters. Impossible to work my HF rig while this POC is turned on. I have never in my 30 + years of ham radio witnessed such a RF pollution generator. Hell the Russian woodpecker wasn't this bad.I suppose I should ask to return it to the manufacture or just play dumb and ask the FCC to find out who the responsible culprit is. Quality means nothing to manufactures these days. This unit is crap. Plain and simple."
2,noise problem,"I purchased this PS based on several reviews here by HAMs, including one by a HAM I know. It might just be this one, which I am either going to send back or take a hammer to, but the noise levels in my IC706MKIIG are so bad it is unusable."
2,"It works, but wear hearing protection","Holy smokes....this is LOUD. It delivers what it promises, but the fan in this unit is loud as heck. I took it apart and replaced the fan with a computer's fan and glad I did. Now I can hear my radios over the noise this makes. I purchased another one and actually disabled the fan altogether. It's probably going to void the warranty, but there is no noise on that at all. Works great and the heat sink in this is so large, I don't expect a problem from doing that. Your mileage may vary."
3,Durability/warranty in question,"This unit operated for about 6 months, then simply died.Repeated emails to the manufacturer's ""support"" address have gone unanswered for two weeks so far.The manufacturer's website [...] has no warranty information AT ALL, and their own retail website provides warranty information that disagrees with their own product packaging.According to the product package literature, the ""two year warranty"" requires returning the product to pyramidcaraudio at your expense, and then you also have to send them $15 to pay for shipping the replaced/repaired product back. This could easily end up costing you half the cost of a new unit, and that's if you don't count your time for anything. And that's assuming that you actually get a working unit back, which given the firm's seemingly haphazard attitude toward warranties and customer service seems less than certain."
2,One radio about to be JAMMED! Rasberry! I hate Rasberry!,"This thing is not any good for a CB or other radio. My old p/s was so quiet I never had to use ANL. Well let me tell you, when this thing got cranked up anywhere in the house (not even powering the radio) the noise shot up from nothing to S-5! This would be great if your neighbors bothered you with their CB, you could use it as a jammer over in your house."
2,RF interference from this product!!,I purchased this item to power a CB base station. (Galaxy DX979). The power supply creates so much RF interference that it prevents any reception at all. Do not attempt to use this product with radio equipment. Returned it the same day. Still waiting for my refund 3 weeks later. Will update this review if and when I receive it.
1,Not very good,It arrived to me not working. I purchased it during a move and my return time ended so I ended up with a huge paper weight. I tried to contact the manufacturer...NO LUCK there either and I was willing to pay to have it fixed.
3,"Product is good, do not order from AmericaRx",5 stars for the product as it is what co-workers wanted for coffee at work.0 stars for AmericaRx where I ordered this through as the title says pack of 3 but I only received 1 50-count box. Contacted seller who said it was Amazon technical error for title listing.I'm not sure if other sellers of this product do same thing but just be warned that even though it says pack of 3 you may only receive 1 like I did. In future I'll just go to the store to get it then so I know what I'm getting and not paying shipping to receive 1 out of 3 pack.
5,Here Comes the Brides and Star Trek Ultimate Crossover!,"This is a fairly old book thats been out of print now for several years. However the story line is excellent.The year is 1885 and the location is Seattle, Washington where Jason, Jeremy, and Joshua Bolt own a mountain and Aaron Stemple own the sawmill when Spock, who's been captured by the Klingons was accidently dropped off/escaped while the Klingons were going to do an assisination.Perfect cross over story. Well worth the 5 bucks with shipping to read for entertainment!"
3,Spock in 19th Century Seattle,"Spock is on a spy mission on a Klingon vessel, when the ship he is on travels back in time to fulfill a nefarious Klingon plan. Spock ends up in late 19th century Seattle with complete memory loss. Ok it's a typical fun Star Trek plot, but what really makes this title a winner is the mashup between Star Trek and the 1970's tv show ""Here Comes the Brides."" In that show a Seattle businessman ships a group of twenty women from Boston so they can become brides for his loggers. In many of the episodes the results were hilarious. Spock, his memory gone, becomes an accountant, while gradually becoming more involved in the community. Meanwhile, Kirk in another time dimension, is trying to figure out what happened to Spock, while deciphering the plans of the Klingons. Spock's adventures in 19th Century Seattle make ""Ishmael"" a worthwhile read."
5,"Another interesting bit of trivia about ""Ishmael""","Several people have mentioned the ""cross-over"" with another 60's TV series. ""Here Come the Brides"". An interesting bit of trivia about this is that Aaron Stemple was played by Mark Lenard, who would also immortalize the character of Sarek (Spock's father) in ""Trek""I read this book years ago and thought it was outstanding - just my ""two cents"" worth."
1,Garbage!,"The worst ever. To quote a teammate who used it, ""What is this, ""axle grease""?!(True Quote)Only had a very little tact if you rubbed dirt on it. I should have know as soon as I squeezed some out because it squirted out too easily, too liquidy. Not good at all! TRY SOMETHING ELSE."
4,Old School Pine Tar,"Having just started playing on the Senior circuit (Sunday morning Baseball), I was in the market for some good old fashion Pine Tar (to help me hold on to the bat as I'm swinging at very bad Curve balls :-).Having been out of the game a bit, I was surprised to find all the new products out there attempting to fill the Pine Tar space. You've got Pine Tar sticks, Grip stick, Tiger sticks and some Pine Tars put out by companies that are not known for their Baseball products (I used one of these and it felt more like Baby Oil)Why do manufacturer's feel the need to change something that isn't broken?Easton has been a company known for Quality Baseball products and their Pine Tar is no different.I know for myself, I've got plenty to think about as I step up to the plate... Atleast my PineTar isn't one of them."
5,An unforgettable tale of two star-crossed lovers,"This book was inspired by everyday romances. We can't see it around us but it is there. Romeo and Juliet is about two star-crossed lovers who overcome boundaries that are supposed to keep them apart: Their parents, the law, yet they overcome them like they're not even there. Though the ending is sad, it keeps you reading and the shakespearean language is not very hard to figure out when the words by themselves, tell the story of this heartfilled romance. Everyone should read it."
4,Another very good Stephen Cannell show,"This is another very good show produced by Stephen Cannell. It fits right in with his other great shows such as The A Team, Renegade, and all the others. Skid McCormick is a racer that gets in trouble 1 time too many with the law. Judge Hardcastle takes a liking to him. The judge retires and sets out to go after 200 crooks that slipped thru loopholes in the law where he had to find them innocent when he knew they were guilty. He takes Skid and his sports car the Coyote under his wing and they go after the bad guys. The series had good plots and lots of action. The dvd's play very clearly and with great sound. If you'rea fan of 80's action or private detective series you will enjoy this show."
4,A wild ride with a couple of great characters,"While the idea of a judge teaming up with an ex-con (whom he had convicted) to go after criminals who escaped on technicalities may sound ridiculous, Brian Keith and Daniel Hugh Kelly pull it off. The stories are generally creative, and the acting is solid, but the chemistry is what makes the show. The Coyote, a custom-built street legal race car, also helps."
4,Scrooge cut short,I really enjoyed these old movies but Scrooge was cut short at the end but love miracle on 34th Street and watched it several times during the holidays.
4,Cowboy didn't give up on his woman,The cowboy persisted to get his woman he loved but his woman resisted him many times.. that story was good.
5,"Wonderful ""Made in the USA"" PYREX and on SALE at Geroys!","You gotta SHOP and keep SHOPPING to find great deals! Geroys now has this 2 cup Pyrex Bowl listed on Amazon for about FIFTEEN dollars EACH, PLUS SHIPPING! BUT RIGHT NOW the bowls are ON SALE for under FIVE dollars EACH delivered! (The four seventy five price per bowl is for eight bowls and includes the shipping cost!!) So I just bought 8 PYREX 2 cup, covered bowls for thirty eight dollars! We serve up our cereal for speed eating in the morning and put the filled bowls in the cupboard for anyone to grab, so we can really use a lot of these bowls, and I am so happy to get a good price. THESE DAYS a bargain is a rare thing, don't you think?By the way, with ""free shipping"" Amazon wants TEN BUCKS for EACH of these bowls right now - even IF they offered ""buy 4 get one free"" like they sometimes do, that is NO BARGAIN. So, shop, shop, shop!"
3,OVERPRICED,$7 for ONE container?!I can't believe I bought it.Went to my local CVS and they're selling a 3 pack for $8.50
1,Great Product--but dont buy at THIS price!!!,"I love these pyrex dishes--to the point of obsession. Freezer, Oven, Microwave, Fridge... LOVE IT! But 11.99 for ONE 2 cup bowl? INSANITY!!!! On this very site you can find sets on sale for the same price with TWO of these bowls and OTHER pieces! Even when they're not on sale, you can buy a set with SEVERAL pieces for under $20. I just wanted some more of these 2 cup containers (storing homemade baby food in freezer--dont want plastic) and was offended yesterday to see Target wanted just under $6. But this... is nuts!!!! Look further. Dont buy at this price."
5,Great for Storage,The pyrex bowl is great for food storage. It keeps food fresh without a plastic taste. Easy to clean too.
5,Great made in USA QUALITY,"Dumped all the plastic containers and went with glass. Easy to clean, store and use. Nice to be able to buy a product made by USA workers."
2,The game is great when it works.,"I have a P4 2.6GHZ W/HT and 1GB of Dual Channel high end Corsair RAM and a Radeon 9600 Pro, and the SATA Raptor 74 GIG HDD.Even with this system, the game cripples my computer and it is one of the extremely few times that I experience the ""blue screen of death"" that I haven't had to deal with since Windows 98. There are even times when Ctr.Alt.Del doesn't work and all I'm left with is the reset button on my computer.If you think that EA games is going to give you support your wrong.On the few occasions that it works, it is an outstanding game. I am aware of systems that don't have trouble with this game that are not as high end as my machine, but beware of the hardware combos, there is no telling which ones will work and which ones won't."
2,Not as good as it could have been,"Bloatware. The ""artists"" spent their time and energy making some pretty graphics that will challenge your video card, and frustrate your internet connection if you have anything less than state of the art. As far as game play, step backward regarding on-line playing. Serious lag even with a high speed connection. No way to communicate effectively with other players and hard to turn off the audio to enhance performance. Starcraft Brood War(a 4 year old game) is superior. The AI is less than top notch. And forget about the QA people actually getting the bugs out. Maps have all sorts of bugs, and for an upgrade, try to import older C&C; maps?Where are specification on unit performance? It trial and error to figure out ranges and weapon effectiveness.EA games seems to want to ""challenge everything"" except producing a top notch game. I was disapointed by this expensive add on product.My recommendation, hold off and get Zero Hour on the cheap."
1,Generals ZH sux,"guys dont be fooled by this extension pack..its totally unstable go to any search engine and look for more informations...ull notice more pple complaining about this guy than voting for it...i enjoyed the game c&c generals and when i saw Zero hour thought its some extension pack like any other game..it turned out a poor game which doesnt work...EA games are trying to blame our systems for the bugs..i bought whole new pc paid around 2000 dollars ""nearly bought a very hight performance pc"" but this this game is causing problems....some time ot starts and mostly it crashed to the desktop with a serriour error msg....there are roumers about EA games trying to direct the market more into simulations and RPG games than strategies "" guess just roumers"" i think u can wait couple more month before u buy until a stable patch shows up...."
4,Correction,"Little Shop of Horrors does not star Jack Nicholson as Semour, rather Mr. Nicholson appears as a creepy dentist patient with a flair for all things unpleasent. His short performance alone would be worth the price of this DVD. But thankfully, the joys to be found in this strange film do not end there. Adding to the fun is Dick Miller (from Bucket of Blood) as a flower lover who takes his taste for botanicals to a new level. Speaking of Bucket of Blood, that is one creepy film. Stupid, but creepy. It also offers a first hand account of the 60s in a more bohemian way than many might be accustomed to. Dick Miller is nearly unrecognizable in a terriffic performance. If nothing else, seeing him and his massive transformation between Bucket of Blood (notice that the initials of this film spell BOB?) and Little Shop of Horrors is worth it. I have yet to see The Terror, but it looks great thanks to Mr. Nicholson again and Boris Karloff."
2,Uses JUnit 3.8 - dated material,"This is a good book. It was very important when it came out. It is dated however and we need a new book on the subject since JUnit is up to version 4.6 as of this writing. Following examples from this book from the start you would want JUnit 3.8 to avoid the confusion. Then you would have to learn the differences between 3.8 and 4.6 which are substantial. Where have all the programmers gone? Books use to be up to date, now we are stuck with many 5 year old books with reviews from 2004. This does not keep programmers informed and secure in their jobs. Time for a new updated edition on this one to make it truly useful."
5,Wow!,"""JUnit Recipes"" is a very thorough and comprehensive encyclopedia of excellent advice and examples on almost every coding situation I've ever wanted to test with JUnit.J. B. Rainsberger has compiled a 700 page collection of scores of excellent recipes written in pattern-like fashion, clearly laying out testing problems in wont of solutions and the practical recipes for solving the problems, including annotated code examples, step-by-step instructions, and plenty of quality explanations.""JUnit Recipes"" is destined to be a classic, and has earned a most prominent place on my bookshelf, as I'm certain I'll be referencing it frequently for new and better ideas on formulating JUnit tests.What's that? You'd like to borrow my copy of ""JUnit Recipes?"" No, get your own."
4,Test your code,"The unit testing framework is simple to use, but some code can be tricky to test.In such a case you will find this book helpful for reference and given examplesin this book.The book has covered testing objects, methods, data, XMl, EJB and web component, sothis book is fit for any one who wants their J2EE development being Unit test.This book has covered one chapter that one can use ant for unit test."
5,Love the pink one!,"The perfect way to find my bat in my co-ed team. I had it on backward, and it slipped right off when I swung the bat. Much better when you put it on the right way! (Hint: if it's HARD to put on, it's on the right way!) Love the pink, too. Worth the price to personalize your bat."
5,Power Pad,"This is a great thing 2 have. it may be co$ty for a cover knob... but its worth. How many time in batting practice do you hear kind go oww because they hit a nubber off the end of the bat? That happens no longer with this product. I suggest you pick 1 of these up, I play pony and with -3 bats and breaking balls i hit a good amount off the end of the bat and it used to sting untill i got this. PICK ONE UP THERE GOOD FOR YOUR HANDS AND YOUR BAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Details of bag should be provided.,"It is a nice well made bag, however no measurements were given in the product details. I was surprised at how thin the main compartment is. It will only hold two small binders. Good luck fitting in your lunch, or using for gym clothes."
1,Star system doesn't help,"I can't really rate this product because the order was never completed. The company called my house a couple of times to verify my age (as an adult), but both times the voicemail they left was garbled like there was some kind of bad connection. Since they couldn't (apparently) contact me and I couldn't contact them, the order was eventually cancelled."
1,worst ever,"Didnt arrive when promised, no email to say it'll be late. They did respond when I emailed them about it, but took 3 weeks longer than promised to arrive!!!"
2,pls open to outside us people,I strongly wish that Amazon can share this to people outside USA. that will be a great news for us people in Taiwan.
5,Beautiful music,I got this CD because 'Belle' is one of my all time favorite songs and I never get tired of listening to it. The whole CD is full of good songs to listen.
5,Why isn't this on broadway?,"I bought this cd a while ago becuase i heard someone playing it and i loved the cover. Kind of superficial reasoning but i'm glad i ordered it anyway. Not to mention the fact the cover is really pretty, the music is just so moving. You dont need to understand french to enjoy this if you know the story. The words dont really matter becuase the music is so powerful. The voices are mostly wonderful. Personally, i think Ezmerelda is a little breathy, but she is still good, and she doesnt sing that much so it doesnt really bother me. I really like that it is recorded live so you can hear how it really happened, i always prefer live over studio. If you liked Les Miserables and Phantom of the Opera and RENT (you have to like all three), then you will love this."
5,Cest magnifique,"I saw the play!, is magisterial, the voices, the coreography and everything was magic, Bruno Pelletier has an extraordinary voice and his performance is outstanding, Garou is the Best Quasimodo ever, Clopin played by Luck Mervil has so many textures and movement. You should appreciate the play and the soundtrack you are going to love it!."
5,A Masterpiece! Je sens l'amour qui s'eveille!,"Notre-Dame de Paris is a masterpiece. I first had the opportunity to hear the music in my High School French class. My parents both speak French fluently so I have grown up around it, but I never realized how beautiful the language really is! Garou's performance as Quasimodo was wonderful and now I am hooked on ""Seul"" (if you haven't heard it, you really have to!). The music is deep and moving. Even if you don't understand French it is still beautiful. It pulls you into the story and creates a great atmosphere.The musical is also amazing to watch. The movement is incredible and the vocals are indescribable. This CD is worth every penny!!!! Enjoy it!!!! Listen to the sample tracks and you will fall in love with it, just as I have! C'est magnifique!And to quote the musical itself, ""C'est celui pour qui mon coeur bat!"" (""It is the one for whom my heart beats!"") Au revoir!"
5,I love her style,"I came across this Helene's CD on the backstreet of my university.It's so great,i should say, she is fabulous,marvelous and let me know how charming French songs could be displayed! I like the background music and her voice,sometimes soft and sometimes hard.Great!Helene Segara.I love Francise!"
5,"It's already been said, but...","... this is one of the most hauntingly beautiful and heartfelt musicals I've ever heard. French sounds beautiful in song, but the performers make it even better. Every one of the songs, and the way it is performed, is excellent!"
5,I can't live without this CD!!!,"There is something about quality musicals that just get under my skin, in a good way, and this is my most favorite of all...yes even more than Phantom of the Opera and probably tied with Les Miserables. This shortened version doesn't include all of the songs, but it has the best ones, if you can't afford the complete set, like me, this is just as good, you will LOVE it!!!"
2,misleading description,"in the description for this CD, it had the songs listed with clip you could hear from them. The clips were from the video i had seen. When the CD shows up, it has a slightly different cast and not all of the songs, only highlights, which excludes my favorite song. very misleading."
2,The musical lacks talented voices,"I read the other reviews of this CD on Amazon. The reviews were very favorable, so I purchased the CD. I am learning the French language, so I am trying to get my hands on as much French material as I can.However, I was very disappointed in this musical. I am a great lover of musicals. Notre Dame de Paris singers have very weak voices that do not carry well at all. Some of the singers sound as though they have sore throats! If you like musicals and great singers, this CD may disappoint you.The lyrics to all the songs are included. This would have been great to help me with learning the language, but I can't stand the bad singing. I wish that I hadn't purchased it."
5,"The album ""Notre Dame de Paris"" is the sunshine of my life.","Notre Dame de Paris is the success of the millenium.It's one of the most or the most beautiful album and show of the world which spectators have waited for a very long time to be served.All the songs have a message to send , which give a sense to life."
5,Outstanding!,Is it possible to wear out the tracks on a CD? We listen to this recording (almost) all the time and take it with us when we travel. And I can't even understand French!
3,A lot of information with an infomorcial,"I think this is a good book. There is a lot of information and it covers a lot of topics that need to be discussed. The one big problem that I have with this book is it comes across as a big infomercial for the doctors who are writing it and the a food company that sells bariatric surgery products.Would I recommend you read it, Yes. Would I recommend you buy their products, NO!"
3,"Funny and well written, just not sure how accurate","I read the book right before I had my Gastric Bypass surgery. I was prepared for anything! The book is humourously written, but I completely agree with another reviewer regarding the symptoms these ladies experienced afterwards. My doctors office had never heard of ""scramps"" either. Interesting that they both had it, but it's not a common after effect."
2,No DS coverage,"While this book is heavy on a dose of reality, lacks coverage of duodenal switch. Not complete in the least. Pretty useless purchase for me."
2,The Real Skinny on Weight Loss Surgery: An Indispensable Guide to What You Can Really Expect!,hello im not sure how to rate this book cause its not one of mine i got this for my mom she was told that she needed this boos before they can go with the Weight Loss Surgery. im guessign its good cause i havent heard anything bad about it.
4,"Informative, if you can overcome the silliness","I purchased this book before my RNY surgery in a blitz to collect and read everything I could on this type of bariatric procedure. While this book is cleverly written, it's not nearly as good as my favorite, and the one I took to the hospital with me, ""Weight Loss Surgery for Dummies"", my bible.I'm not sure if I believe these women when they detail their experiences. They've had every side-effect and complication, including some I ran to my surgeon with and neither he nor his entire staff had ever heard of. ""Scramps"" being one of them. Some of the things are laugh-out-loud funny, like when Karen goes out with her husband and doesn't realize that post-bariatric surgery, alcohol speeds right into your bloodstream. She winds up screaming in laughter at a barking dog when her husband is forced to drive her home.This book is a good read, kind of like a Fannie Flagg book, but I wouldn't take it as law."
2,Not realistic - not well written either,"Please know that the experiences of these two women cannot necessarily be generalized to all people who opt for weight loss surgery. Between them, the authors have suffered just about every malady that could ever occur with anyone who ever had weight loss surgery - and even a couple new things.My WLS group read and discussed it and almost everyone agreed that the authors either were not well educated about WLS prior to their experience or that they choose to 'forget' or disregard the information. Their description of what happens when they try to dine at an all-you-can-eat buffet is gross and unnecessary.It's my hope that anyone considering WLS doesn't see this as a true representation, but instead as the journey of two women. Many people don't have the complications listed here (espeically with lapband).So...read it, but don't take it as gospel.As the commercials used to say: Your mileage may vary...."
1,not the best choice,"I read this book along with the Weight Loss for Dummies book. The authors nearly scared me out of the procedure. They made it sound as if I would suffer from each and every possible malady including some that they have clearly made up. The book is long, redundant and not even a little bit funny. Honestly, do we really need an entire chapter to tell us that we might experience some hair loss? I felt like their ultimate message was ""yes, we have had the procedure and reaped the benefits--but now we will attempt to talk you out of it"". Your time will be better spend reading one of the countless other books on the subject."
4,Fun And Informative,"I am an Operating Room nurse, who had Roux n Y surgery 10 years ago (before the laparoscopic technique was perfected.) I experienced many of the side effects and complications described in this book. When I had my surgery, there were very few written resources, both pre-op and post-op, and many of the patients went into the process with little knowledge of what they were getting themselves into. The hospital where I work is in the planning stages of our own Bariatric surgery program. I had attended a Bariatric Seminar For Healthcare Providers at the beginning of the month, and had the pleasure of hearing Julie Janeway (one of the authors) speak. I wish that there were books like this back when I was in my ""Getting To Know Me"" stage immediately post-op. There were no support groups in my area, so I really felt like I was totally alone. I would recommend this book to anyone considering weight loss surgery."
2,Good Entertainment,"This program a well edited and visually well executed. It makes for good entertainment. The points made in the film are speculation and not solid science, but this is understandable as the film is based on a book authored by Mark Lynas, who has a formal education in history and politics. His interpretation of statistical climate models is simplistic at best as would be to the lay person.Overall good viewing to be had if your not a skeptic and uninterested in an unbiased and objective discussion on climate change."
3,Informational but a little boring,"The video has some very good, researched information, but it wasn't as thrilling as Planet Earth. It is still a very good video though and I learned a lot."
1,Six Degress Could Sell More Blu-Ray Discs,"It would be nice to see a documentary on climate change someday where there was less preaching and more sound science. This is an advocacy presentation, not a documentary."
3,A little disappointed,"I ordered this video to show to my middle school science students. After reviewing it, however, I think I'll go with something else. The special effects were hokey, and some of the riot scenes would be inappropriate to show in a middle school setting. I was disappointed."
1,Propaganda,"This bears absolutely no relationship to reality.Your money would be better spent on the Firefly series on blu-ray, far more believable."
3,Not as good as 11th hour,"The format was somewhat high schoolish, in the manner of describing in pictures, what would happen at each degree centigrade rise in global avg. temp. Excellent interview with Richard Heinburg though. I did not care for the mix of documentary & reality tv style videography, with a women running around her house on the cell phone getting ready to evacuate. Alec Baldwin's narration did not do the film justice. Much preferred Leo Decaprio's sincerity in the 11th hour. Save your money, your not missing much. Expected much better from NGS."
2,The politics/mysticism of aesthetics.,"Roerich, Nicolas. Shambhala. This is a collection of dispatches during travels in Tibet and the borderlands of the eastern Russian frontier by the Russo-American painter, poet and mystic which date from the late 20's and early 1930's. If you like Gurdjieff, Roerich will interest you. He believed that Beauty was a divine principle that could be used to transform the world.Though the central section did not hold my attention, the first chapters about a Tibet long gone were fascinating. This was partly due to Roerich's idiosyncratic spelling which cast a new light on the meaning of certain Sanskrit words."
5,Scamper Into Your Hearts,"This is a wonderful movie! I love it! It was one of my favorite movies in elementary school. It's educational, has delightful characters, adorable animation, and catchy music. WHY WON'T THEY PUT SCAMPER ON DVD?!"
3,not so quick charger,"it takes 6 hours to charge 4 batteries, not 1 hour. but other than that I guess its an okay charger."
4,Donny and Marie Nostalgia,"This is a great collection of the best of Donny and Marie's TV shows from the 1970s.It brings back all of the sounds and sights of that era, and is a nice compilation for any Donny and Marie fan."
3,Donny and Marie,"If you love the Osmonds, you probably want this. My daughter asks for their video for Christmas."
2,We need a DVD of the series,"No one could best judge this series better than the child we all were when we gazed upon Donny and Marie's chemistry that I'm sure most of us wished we had with our own siblings. I was laughed at by my big brothers for crying when the show was over, every night for weeks. I got over the tears but found a calling in the profession of music and singing, as a grown up, because of their show. I would absolutely support the creation of a DVD of more of the basic series; not just what someone thought was good. I even enjoyed their take on a daytime show. I missed most of their shows due to my father being stationed in Germany as an MP for the Army. But I truly still love Donny and Marie. Give us more!!!"
3,"Better than nothing, but....","Must admit to being an Osmond since the early 70s, and as I am now living in China, I jumped at any chance to Donny and Marie perform. After a 30 year wait, what one gets is hardly a best of collection, but 2 sample discs of 4 incomplete Donny and Marie shows. I realise that Donny experienced royalty and cost issues when he tried to create a compilation disc set. This compromise leaves fans wondering if the full collection of 72 episodes will ever be released on dvd. All this aside, am glad to have a high quality reproduction on DVD, as the sound and the images are awesome!"
5,Awesome!,"Donny and Marie at their best! When Marie was only 16 and Donny 18, the talented brother and sister duo perform their famous, ""I'm a little bit country, I'm a little bit rock and roll"" concerts amd slapstick comedy skits. The numerous guest stars that appeared throughout the years (Bob Hope, Carl Reiner, Ruth Buzzi, Paul Lynde and Charo to name a few) make this DVD a treat to watch for all of those wanting a bit of nostalgia from the '70's. The Osmond Brothers and the Ice Vanities also make their appearances and add to the fun of this weekly variety show. Take a trip back in time and enjoy this DVD for the whole family. A Bonus Photo Gallery is included.But please, next time Donny-the whole season's shows and not the heavily edited ones?"
1,Is it a waste of money or ...,"The pro of buying this DVD set is the excellent color/picture compared to your home made recordings with your VCRs or the official ""Best Of"" VHS released by Donny back in late 90s. But what about the sound/audio you get on this DVD. Well I have no 5.1 DTS sound on disc 1 episode 1. It is 100% silent when choosing that audio feature. Furthermore, as printed somewhere on the box, it are no full episodes but edited versions."
4,Donny & Maries Osmond TV Show,"this product has excellent quality, various selection, not much episodes though... loved it."
3,The Best of Donny & Marie: Volume 1 DVD,"I gave this item a ""middle-of-the-road"" rating only because I have not completely watched this DVD. I bought this DVD because it was a gift. However, when I asked the person who I gave the DVD to how the set was, she said that it was pretty good and allowed her to relive fond memories. I would say that if you are a huge fan of Donny and Marie, this DVD volume may be a 4-star or a 5-star rating. I watched a few scenes and the only one I remember, and personally my favorite scene, was a skit presumably performed around the Christmas season, where toys came to life in a human-sized toy room and Donny and Marie were seen as Raggedy Ann and Andy."
3,good butttttttt,"Vol. 1-Best ofIve been an osmond fan for 36 years and I was very disappointed in this 2 disc set. I was expecting full episodes. I was also expecting to see their very first show. I can still remember their first opening song, thats the way i like it, made popular by KC and the sunshine band. the donny and marie show, although over 30 years ago, was so burned into my memory but i didnt recognize or remember any of the songs or skits in this set. If this is supposed to be their best, maybe I will pass on volume 2. I also noticed that with each episode, marie got skinnier and skinnier til by last show she looks anorexic. That bothered me more than the disappointment i have in this set. Dont ask me why LOL, it just does..."
1,How very corney!!!,"I purchase Vol. 1 & 2 . because I use to be a huge fan of the show when I was younger. Watching it I couldn't believe what D & M picked to be their best clips(???) I would have to say the best, (if I had to pick) was of Andy Williams,(thats it!!) Other then that, It was very corny and it didn't hold my interest. The two video's were only from 1976 & 77. I'm surprized !! Again, when I watch any of the Sonny & Cher Show or the Starky & Hutch oldies, now they bring back a lot of happy memory's of that time period & it was so much fun watching it!! I really thought I would have the same feeling watching these two video's of D & M considering I use to be pasted to the tv set when they were on!I'm disappointed!! Out of the full four years this is what they came up with (???)In my opinion, D & M should of put clips together of their famous guest stars. Like Cher, Englebert Humperdink, etc. etc...Just my opinion!!"
3,I'm joining the club...,GREAT for what you get.I agree that we should get more episodes (complete!) for this price.
5,We love this set!,"My husband bought this set for me for Christmas. It's only been a week, but we have no complaints. Food cooks beautifully and cleanup is a breeze. Like the other reviews said, you don't need to cook on high heat. Also, if you want the set to last a long time, don't use metal utensils. They also look nice hanging on the pot rack by my stove.If you are looking for a nice cookware set at a great price, get this one...you won't be disappointed."
2,Never put in dishwasher--really!!!,"Got brand new set and put a couple of pieces in the dishwasher, before using. The outer finish was absolutely, utterly ruined! I guess American consumers are getting used to ""made in China"" workmanship, but I want to know how many of today's busy two-parent working families really want to spend time washing pans by hand! Really?On my set, the only indication that the dishwasher would harm the outer finish was in small print, at the very end of the verbiage about how fabulous they are. I am very disappointed, and plan to return them. Stupid. I have other non-stick pans that don't have this problem at all."
3,Okay for Beginners,Purchased for child's first apartment. Decent value for number and quality of pieces. Very acceptable for beginners and aspiring chefs.
5,CUISINART,"THESE POTS AND PANS ARE WONDERFUL. EVERYTHING COOKS QUICKER AND THEY CLEAN SO EASY.I HAD T-FAL FOR 15 YEARS AND THEY WERE NOT ANORIZED. I BELIEVE THIS MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE. ALSO, AMAZON IS THE BEST SITE TO DEAL WITH. THEIR SITE IS EASY TO GET ON AND THEIR DELIVERY IS WONDERFUL. I DO LOVE DEALING WITH THEM."
4,Pots and pansFor,for the price these are excellent. shipping took a little longer than other things i purchased on amazon in the past. have used them almost everyday for the past 3 months and so far they have help up great
4,So Far So Good,after reading all the pro and con reviews i decided to take a chance and purchase this cookware set.my old aluminium set was almost worn out after 15 years of use. iv'e had limited use with them. i use them for soup.pasta.any frying meats and potatoes. with my old aluminium soup pot when the water boiled and i poured in the dry soup contents in it would spill over and sometimes put out the pilot light. i was pleasantly surprised when i poured in the contents and there was no spillover onto the burner. however when boiling water its slow to come to a full boil. the 9 quart stock pot is big enough to cook almost 5 pounds of rice!
3,"Great service from Dependable, terrible from Cuisinart","The first set we received had a defective stockpot, out of round & lid would not fit, it was clearly a factory defect as all packaging was intact and all other pieces were fine. The 2nd set had a defective lid, again clearly from the factory. Cuisinart's customer service was rude and would do nothing to help, Dependable Resource was EXCELLENT. They made the exchange process as painless as possible and we would definitely do business with them again. If we ever purchase any Cuisinart pans in the future, it will be at a storefront where we can inspect the merchandise BEFORE taking it home."
5,Exceeded my expectations.,"When I opened the box, I knew the pots had exceeded my expectations. What a relief. A couple of things I especially like about them. 1) the handles are long, 2) there is a very small sauce pan, which I've found very useful (like hard-boiling just 2 or 3 eggs, 3) I like that the small frying pan is not too small, but just right. It's a fantastic buy, high-quality set of pots that I expect to be using ten years from now. : )"
5,Cookware,Studied long and hard before my wife and I made this decision. I like to cook and I absolutely love this cookware. Very easy to clean. Even heat distribution. This stuff is a dream. I highly recommend it to anyone who cooks at home. You will not be disappointed.
2,Quantanium contains Teflon,"The interior of the pans is NOT anodized aluminum, but ""Quantanium"". It's an excellent non-stick surface, and so far my set works fine. However, if you're concerned about overheated Teflon and the chemicals being released into your food, you'll have to pay more to get a real anodized aluminum set.Quantanium is not safe over 500 degrees F. It does contain PTFE, the same chemical in Teflon, which is potentially carcinogenic. Fumes from cooking are harmful to animals. And lastly, the non-stick layer is very thin, and will eventually come of. I bought my set thinking I was getting hard-anodized aluminum for a steal, but it seems you DO have to ante up for Calphalon or a more expensive brand to get the real stuff."
3,Not good in the long run,"I was very happy with this set when I first purchased it 2 years ago. They are easy to clean and cook evenly. After a year of heavy use small patches of the nonstick coating started coming off. These pots and pans have never been in the dishwasher, used over high heat, or had metal utensils used on them. This is a set that won't last very long if you use it everyday."
4,Great Buy,I bought this set to replace my first set of cookware. These pots cook really fast so you have to be careful not to use too much heat. The only thing I don't like is that the lit handles get hot too and if you are boiling something with the lid on water usually spills. Other than that I can't complain. These pots are sooooooo easy to clean. Nothing sticks to them.
3,A good cookware set with one exception...,"I've had my Cuisinart cookware set a little over a month, and it functions nicely. This is my first Cuisinart brand purchase, but family members have spoken highly of this brand so I wanted to try it. I have experienced just one problem thus far, and I believe it to be a design flaw. When covering a fry pan or sauce pan while cooking, the cover handle gets very hot. Not hot enough to blister my fingers, but hot enough to quickly drop the cover! For this reason, I'll probably bypass any further Cuininart purchases. I am 71 years old, have owned several cookware sets, but have never experienced hot cover handles previously."
4,Durable but can be sensitive.,"I use this cookware every day and it is durable. It heats quickly and evenly. The handles stay cool to the touch. However, it can be sensitive. You defnititely have to hand-wash it. If you place it in the dishwasher, you will damage the non-stick coating. I use the sauce pan to fry corn torillas for tacos on a regular basis and the baked-on oil is virtually impossible to remove (trust me, I've tried everything). I use the 10"" frying pan to fry eggs and although the oil is easier to remove because I'm using a lower temperature, there has been some discoloration of the non-stick coating over time. So if you are going to use any piece with oil, I would recommend removing the oil and cleaning the piece of all oil as soon as possible after use."
4,sturdy and durable. Quality utencils for cooking,very impressed by the quality of the utensils. Dishes are tasty using these. food does not get burnt quickly. very helpful for cooking certain types of food.Wish they had better handles. And ofcourse they are heavy and needs extra effort for cleaning.
4,Cuisinart cookware,"My husband and I really like this set of cookware. It is very attractive and very functional. The lids fit well enough, although I feel that they should fit a tighter. All in all, we are quite satisfied."
5,Great Deal!,We are very happy with the Cuisinart 10-Piece Cookware Set. This was a great deal for the price.
1,Dont waste your money on this - buy Kitchenaid instead,"I purchased the Chef's Classic Nonstick Hard-Anodized 12-Piece Cookware Set from Amazon.com in 2009 and about last year, the hard anodized coating started peeling from one of the pans. OK - one is an anomaly. Then this happened on another of the utensils in the set and now almost every piece has its coating peeling off. Note that I also bought a comparable KitchenAid set at the same time and those are doing great. I can definitely confirm that I have not used any metal cookware with these and I have not put them in the dishwasher. Is this a common issue or did I get a bad batch??"
1,SEEMED GOOD FOR A SHORT TIME,The paint on ALL pots and pans came off with a simple wipe of a paper towel after a couple of uses...VERY unhappy.
5,Good Set...,It's been a good set so far. I love the fact that I don't need oil or cooking spray to make over-easy eggs or omlets. The non-stick coating is great and the pans can go straight from the stove top to the oven. I plan to make a lasagna in the large saute pan...that should be interesting. :)
1,lids don't fit,"Unfortunately, the lids don't fit on the stock pot or the saute pan. So disappointing, as they are described as fitting so well! I'm worried that if I return it, I'll get the same thing again. I wish I could just return the defective pieces and not the whole set."
1,Two strikes and you're out,"After doing some research, I chose to purchase this 10-piece set mainly due to price of $109.00. I received the first set and found that the 3-quart saucepan was warped. As a result, the lid would not fit correctly and I sent that set back. The second set arrived a few days later and this time the 3-quart as well as the stockpot was warped. So I sent the second set back and requested a 3rd set. To my surprise, Amazon just simply refunded my money without my approval and canceled my request for the third set. I was hoping that the third set would have been in order but I guess I will never know. Now it is back to doing some more research before I buy a different cookware set."
4,Cookware,"Cooks great, Looks great. Gotta be careful, can't use anything but teflon or other non-scracth utnesils or it will scratch."
2,Scratches all over the set,"I have ordered this item and got the package,but when I opened it to check the lids and other stuff (as others have written that lids were nt fitting properly). All the items had little scratches all over the brim of the dishes.Please check your package carefully when it is delivered."
3,not as good as I expected,"I was disappointed in the quality overall of this product. It did not occur to me that cuisinart may have a cheap line of cookware, but that seems to be the case. I would recommend spending more money and getting something better. These pans are thinner than those I've seen in the store and the outside surface scratches easily."
3,Non-stick coating is wearing off,"I am disappointed with this set - particularly with the saucepans. Despite using nothing but wooden spoons, in less than six months, the non-stick coating in all three saucepans have started to flake off. The frying pans are still holding up well, but I expected more from Cuisinart."
5,A great set!,"This set of cookware is great for my purposes of cooking for a small family. The heat distributes evenly and fairly quickly. Clean up is a breeze. I've had this set for a year, and only have one piece where the non-stick coating has been nicked, and that took a pretty serious hit to make that happen. Just use wooden or non-stick utensils and always hand-wash."
5,The Best Music Dvd Ever,This dvd had me laughing from start to finish. If you like Simple Plan you should get this. It will keep you laughing even after you are done watching it.
5,Thank You Pat and Chuck!,"""A Big Package For You"" is a MUST HAVE for Simple Plan fans, even if you're not a hardcore fan, you'll still enjoy this DVD. It's freakin' hilarious! It includes behind-the-scenes footage of the band and their crazy antics. I won't list exactly what it includes because I don't want to ruin it for you, but if you don't own a copy by now.. you are definitely missing out! The DVD was created by band member, Chuck Comeau, and the footage was recorded by their good friend, Pat, whom toured with them from the beginning. So, with that.. you must know this contains THE BEST footage ever!"
5,"Once a fan, now I'm more","Before I veiwed this DVD I was a fan of Simple Plan. I wasnt really into the music all that much, I mean, I have the cd and I listened to it every so often. It just never caught my fancy for some odd reason. I saw this for the first time recently and absolutely fell in love with Simple Plan. It really shows how awesome each of the guys are and that they arent just some ridiculous fad like a lot of things that are around now. The day after I saw it I went and bought it, then it was in my DVD player and didnt leave. I watched it multiple days in a row and still am, its just awesome. I must say it is one of the best purchases I made. Now Im hooked on Simple Plan. If you are a fan or not you will want this DVD. If you dont then you are just silly and are openly admitting the fact that you are silly. Now click that buy button and await your order!"
1,Why isn't the DVD shipped within 24 hours?,"The DVD release date has come and unfortunately, not everyone was able to get a copy. In Quebec and some parts of Ontario, Canada, there have been some production delays. Apparently the Regie has to view every DVD and rate it and it seems that they were delayed in doing so. Because of that, some stores were not able to get the product in time. However, we are working very very hard to fix everything and stores will be getting their copies any day now. We are soooo sorry for these problems and hopefully everything will be back in order very soon. (www.simpleplan.com)"
1,Manufacturer Mistake,"My God Child LOVES Simple Plan, and what's not to love they are adorable. This DVD packaging claims to be the clean version, well after 2 tries through Amazon, both are not clean. (at least in our case) I would not expect a clean version to have explicit language, and a shower scene that leaves little to the imagination... Too bad as my god child is very disapointed."
3,Where is the DVD?,"Im a fan of Simple plan, and I was wating for this to come in the mail. And when I got it the case had no DVD!!! I was dissapointed but they replaced it for me. So I just ot it today and I'm gong to watch it now."
5,Simple Plan at their greatest,"This is one of the best DVDs I have ever seen! Simple Plan is awsome to let us see footage of crazy things they do. No other band would do this like they did. Once you've seen the footage of them all around the world, you see them as regular people. They do crazy things that 24 year olds do...and that's the best part. All of them like pulling practical jokes on each other and on Patrick. Buy the DVD if you like their music!"
5,A BIG Package for YOU,"Anyone who has enjoyed Simple Plan's music from the beginning (such as myself), I have to say that this DVD is a tribute to fans such as us. I have watched it a couple of times with my sister and we both enjoy it more and more everytime we watch it. It's almost as if you're there, with the band, on their tours. It offers an intimate look at the boys of Simple Plan while they goof around or play hard. Definately a must get if you're a Simple Plan fan."
5,"It really is ""A Big Package For You""",This DVD was the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life! If you're a Simple Plan fan you'll love it! If you're not....what are you thinking?!...but you'll love it too! It's just a great bunch of guys doing what they love being dorks and just showing their fans they really do care! so run out and buy it! support the band and get a good laugh while you're at it.
4,Its the best,I loved this dvd. The music and the band are great. I can't get enough of this dvd. I can watch it over and over again. I now love simple plan even more than i did before.
5,the best package worth your moolah,"an awesome dvd that will even have the simple plan haters laughing. this is THE DVD for any simple plan fan - haven't met them yet? well, this is your opportunity. almost 3 hours of footage, plus a new song, ""crash and burn."" canadian bum everywhere. check out their journey to from nobodys to the ""ballsy kings of canadian punk-pop."" you'll laugh, you'll cry, but first, you'll buy the dvd."
5,Hilarious,"Wow...this dvd is so funny. You'll laugh, you'll cry. It's great. It will keep you laughing all 2 hours and 37 minutes of it! It shows so much backstage footage and a lot of the guys just acting stupid. The extras are the best part. If you do not get this dvd you'll regret it. Even if you're not a fan or not that big of a fan, there is never a better time to start then now. I garentee that after seeing the dvd that you'll love them. It's great even if you want to have it playing in the backround. It's..perfect!"
5,EXCELLENT!,Watching this DVD honestly lets you get to know the guys of Simple Plan. It has to be the most hilarious video I've ever seen. The guys play pranks and just mess around like normal guys. I've met them before and this DVD just shows how real and down to earth they are because it's not FAKE! The chapter of Patrick is the funniest!
5,Put Your Best Foot Forward,"Interviewing potential employees feels like a cross between a treasure hunt and a business transaction. The boss is looking for someone with energy, enthusiasm, job skills, and who fits with the current team. Far too many candidates have no idea of the image they project. Slumped in a chair while mumbling answers is not likely to impress an employer."
1,awful graphics and horrible instructions,We bought this hoping to practice math over summer break. This is horrible. The instructions are not clear and we didn't know what we were doing during activities. The graphics are awful. I do not recommend this. Try Reader Rabbit activities instead!
2,"Love Wilton, Just Not This Color","I made a basketball cake for my son and the instructions called for terra cotta icing color. I was a little confused when I picked this item up, because the label on the dye shows a red color, nothing near ""true"" terra cotta, but the swatch (as seen left of the dye) shows terra cotta. I went ahead and purchased this and wasted my time and money. My icing came out pink and and grew closer to red as I added more dye. I ended up using orange and various other colors to get my desired terra cotta coloring."
4,Stain the Water Clear,"I have not yet read her book, but I want to because I enjoy her weekly article in our paper. If you have dogmatic views and don't enjoy having your mind stretched DON'T read her because she presents her opinions in a nontraditional way that makes you think even if you don't agree with her. I manage a bookstore where we've had her come for a booksigning. She is a down-to-earth, unpretentious person just like her writing. We have sold lots of her book."
1,Please Clear The Water,First of all this woman has no right writing anything that could be called remotely religious.Put simply I would say don't waste your time or money on this book..
4,Used a few times - seems to work well,"I've seen similar tools and wanted to try one. I've used it on 4 cond 22 gage, shielded instrumentation grade cable and CAT5 pvc. It's worked quite well and certainly better than I expected for the price."
5,A Must read,"Thought provoking, intriguing and deeply disturbing, this story arc is really quite amazing. A must read for its' social commentary alone."
5,Awesome Book!,"This book is amazing! Great for science lovers, environment lovers, and good book lovers! It teaches us humans as a whole to learn to love and try to care for our beloved environment which is currently going through rough times."
1,Unbelievable plot; hero deserved a better heroine,"I was really, really looking forward to reading this book. It combined a Victorian setting with a classic Gothic plot, and it had a heroine who had been unfairly tarred by scandal. All elements I love to read about.However, you can have all those elements and still have a book that simply does not work. Why? The heroine. Sometimes, she's clever -- but most of the time, she does stupid things. She yearns for the cad who almost took her virginity. And worst of all, she suspects the charming hero of murder -- even though there is no evidence at all. Steede deserved better than this!To make matters worse, the plot hinged on coincidence after coincidence, with gaping holes in logic.I gave this book an F at All About Romance."
5,I liked it,"I found the characters in this book a little too good to be true, but I like how I didn't have to wait too long for Steede and Victoria to realize their love. And then the story continued to an even happier ending. Wonderful book."
4,get moving!,use with school age children with multiple disabilities; layout and pictures make it easy to integrate into occupational therapy sessions
1,terrible buy,I agree with the other reviewers - I was really disappointed. This too slim volume - especially for the price - is designed for a 5 year old - and a simple one at that. Not a good buy - WAY too little info and annoying hand drawn illustrations- all in all a terrible buy.
1,Brain Gypped,"What a waste of money. Just another cute little teaching nothing designed to sell a few books. Well, maybe Paul & Gail will enjoy a meal on me."
1,Disappointed Occupational Therapist,"This book is useless without the Brain Gym Teacher's Edition. The teacher's edition explains how to do all the different exercises and what skills they work on. The orange Brain Gym book is just a summary of all the moves. I haven't used the orange book since I bought it a year ago...it was a waste of money. I use the Teacher's Edition frequently. If you want to incorporate Brain Gym into your classroom/clinic, buy the Teacher's Edition."
2,Just a bit too cute,"This book (pamplet really) is written from the viewpoint of a 6 year old. This approach gets really old, really quickly. And as the book spends so much time on 'mommy says space buttons help her....' it leaves out many details on how to actually perform these exercises. The premise of the book is excellent, and I would bet that the exercises are useful, but please, treat me like an adult!"
2,A bit expensive for what it has to offer,"The information in this product could be given in a much more concise means, in a pamphlet for example. I was disappointed to receive so little for so much money. I was also purchasing the teacher's edition, and had read a review that to understand the teacher's book, one needed this book (the student book). Not true. Turns out that the teacher's book has the corresponding pages from this book on each page. All together I was very disappointed--another one of those self-published, self-illustrated (poorly), over-priced books. Shouldn't cost more than $4 or $5, but it does..."
5,better than plastic,"easy to cut/file, eases the string tension and when whammying or tuning, also helps sustain, just a bit."
3,"Okay condition,but could have been better...","The pages of this book were pretty dry and yellowed. However, that didn't prevent it being read, and at the price, the condition was okay."
1,stay far away!!!,"from these dvds,talk about a waste of money!me and my friend whom have both been writing for about 10-20 yrs. started too watch this and through it were shocked on how completly lame and artistly poor in both the camera work and the painters were!i would not recomend any ''gtv'' too anyone!i am deffinetly not going too watch these again and will probally throw em away!if you want an awsome dvd get war1 2 3{not sold here though}.."
2,Buyer Beware !,"I gave this booklet 2 stars because it does expose the Catholic Church and her Jesuits as the true enemy of all that they do not or have not already subjugated. I believe that everyone that has any knowledge of religious history are aware of these facts. However, the problem with this rag is the fact that it is published and circulated by some Jewish sabbath day keeping cult. I believe it is a branch of the Branch Davidians. Satan is slicker than snot on a doorknob. He doesn't care if you discover part of the truth, especially if that truth is pretty much common knowledge and readily available elsewhere, as long as in the process he might be able to lure you into some other grievous error, which might not be so glaringly obvious."
1,Garbage,I have received this book 4 times in two months through the mail and it is garbage. Straight garbage. I used it once to light a fire in my grill.
1,vitriol,"I received this booklet in the mail today. It is anti-Catholic, linking the Jesuits to every kind of evil in history. Certainly, there is no love within these pages. It amazes me that individuals who proclaim to have read the Bible can come to a viewpoint of such hatred and paranoia. Needless to say, this unsolicited material quickly found its way into my trash - where it belongs."
4,Classic Steve Martin!,"What can I say, this is one great video. It includes several classic routines including my personal favorite:""What the Hell is That""? It also has a Mr. Bill clip and two performances by the Blues Brothers. If you like the comedy of Steve Martin, I strongly recommend this tape."
2,Good if you are an English MD student,"This book was misrepresented on Amazon and it should be clearly stated that this book is a ""how to"" on entering residencies for various specialties in the UK which is quite different from the US. It was of no use to me because it did not address the training and lifestyles for specialties in the US."
2,Disposable,"My jack stand has developed cracks after just two seasons and I no longer use it. Pros: It is light, handy and easy to store; it won't absorb water like a block of wood will. I'm debating on buying a new one, but will consider it disposable (like a tire)."
5,Fits the bill,As advertized. Works great! Just what I was looking ffor and could not find locally at two different RV dealers.
5,arm saver,This works as expected and greatly reduces the amount of cranking to level or hook up the trailer. also much less complicated and cheaper than going electric. low tech but great results well worth the money
5,Trailer Tongue,"Neat idea and alot mor stable then boards, good quality jack stand!Color is easy to see, would recomend!The prie is fair for the product."
3,Not sun proof,"It was great for about two years, but eventually began to display cracks from the sun and the trailer weight. It never actually failed to support my trailer, but the cracks make me nervous. Still for the price, it's probably the best option on the market. Better than stacking wood or blocks."
2,Not the right stuff,"Bought this to support my trailers tongue while traveling and in storage. But not knowing what the weight rating was it turns out to be the wrong thing. I have a 30 foot trailer with a 1000# tongue rating and this thing collapsed when I tried to use it. It wasn't that much money to make a fuss over, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else."
2,A little narrow,"When I bought this product I thought "" great I won't need to bring heavy cinder blocks with me anymore."" Well, I was wrong. The top is too narrow for my jack to go on safely. When I put the camper on it, it seems way to unstable."
1,Interesting but fatally flawed,"an interesting film, but it spends most of its time trying to discredit a simple bible statement - that is that homosexuality is an abomination in the sight of G-d. If this is discredited, then why separate wool and flax, why avoid pork, or shellfish, why worry about seething a kid in its mother's milk? they're all obsolete!! In fact, if one believes (as I assume the Orthodox do) that the Torah is the divine word of G-d which is ""for all time"" and unchangeable, then it's ""All or Nothing"". I'm not arguing for either point-of-view here, but discrediting 1 law must equally discredit all."
3,INTERESTING BUT NOT ENOUGH,"WE WAITED ON LINE OUTSIDE THE MOVIE THEATRE IN THE ICE COLD WEATHER FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES ANXIOUS TO SEE THIS MOVIE. WE EXPECTED TO SEE SOMETHING UNUSUAL WITH REGARD TO THE TITLE BUT THE BOTTOM LINE WAS IT WAS DISAPPOINTING BECAUSE MANY OF THE PEOPLE PARTICIPATING IN THE MAKING OF THE DOCUMENTARY WOULD NOT SHOW THEIR FACES. IT IS HARD TO GET INVOLVED WITH A CHARACTER IF YOU CANNOT IDENTIFY WITH THEM IN THE VISUAL SENSE. ALSO THE MOVIE WOULD HAVE BEEN APPRECIATED MORE IF IT HAD JUST BEEN SHOWN ON THE""DISCOVERY CHANNEL"" OR ""PAY PER VIEW"" AND WE DID'NT HAVE TO PAY AS MUCH AS WE DID FOR 2 TKTS FOR SOMETHING THAT LEFT US FEELING BLAND."
4,Amazing revelation,"I have always been proud of being gay, and like any other adolescent guy, I went through the whole ""coming out"" experience living behind traditional images of my past and my origins. Now at this point of my life, i've come to understand that being gay is more than just being trendy, going to clubs every single weekend, and worship madonna. Thanks to your movie a new debate beings in order to understand the wide plethora of gay identities, and how can we follow our traditions, and feel at peace with all the layers that makes our self. Shalom"
1,You can do better than Yukon,"The Yukon 6-100x100 is better priced than equivalent spotting scopes, yet this item is not worth any price. The Yukon spotting scope has multiple problems. The most annoying is the view lense. One has to keep their head unnaturally still to keep the image in sight. Once the user achieves finding the image they need to use three controls to zoom and focus, two for the zoom options and then focus. With the weight of the front lense keeping the scope on target while selecting the zoom and focus, only exceptionally well disciplined people will be able continue to keep their head and the unit steady so as not to loose the image in the view lense.For those who visit the Yukon website, it shows some incredible capabilities of a spotting scope, but it can't be the the Yukon 6-100x100. There is no plausible way it can magnify as demonstrated. The Yukon company should be investigated for false advertising."
1,Claustrophobia,Not a good story line at all I was waiting for the movie to come together at the end but it never did. I was disappointed and left feeling empty the same way this movie ended.
4,Detailed Performance,"I own about every peformance of the Rachmaninoff concertos currently available in the catalogue. This rendition misses the emotional heart of both concertos.....but I like it nonetheless and the reason is because every note is so cleanly artilculated that you hear things that you will not hear in any other recording. That being said, my favorite for the first concerto is Earl Wild with Horenstein...completely electrifying. My favorite 2nd concerto is Gary Graffman with Bernstein. This is a worthy addition to the library and I heartily recommend it."
2,Krystian Zimerman plays Rachmaninoff Concertos Nos. 1&2,"Things start out promisingly enough in the performance of the First Concerto.Krystian Zimerman may very well be the foremostpianist of our time.He has technique and musicianship to burn.Matters,however,quickly go downhill in the Second Concerto.The orchestra sounds a lot of the time like it was recorded inthe next room.And the orchestral playing sound uncommitted to boot!What a pity,for this could have been the SecondConcerto recording for the ages for Zimerman plays the solopart most brilliantly and probingly indeed!! This may very wellbe the worst concerto recording that I have ever heard in mymore than 30 years of listening and collecting!! Krystian Zimerman should have insisted on another go at it!!"
3,not the old skool house,"I have some of his older stuff, and I was somewhat dissapointed with this cd. I was hoping for more of the old skool house, and this felt more like a happy pop-culture type mix"
4,Good book for future doctors,"This is a really good book for people who want to become a doctor or are interested in the health field. I really recommend this book to those of you who are interested in medicine. If you are not then there really is no point in you reading this book.The book is mostly about a particular hospital. The five patients the title talks about are normal people that go to the hospital for surgery, check-ups, and treatment. Each of those five patients has it's own theme. For instance, when Crichton gives the story of the patient that had surgery, he gives information on surgery, from the history of surgery to the details on anesthetics. On the patient that got a check-up without the doctor being there, he gives info on technology and how it has revolutionized medicine.Overall, this is a really good book if you're interested in this kind of stuff. You have to read it if you're interested in the health/medical field."
3,"Works, but I found it a little flimsy. Possibly better for smaller pieces.","While this is easy to cut with scissors and works, I found that I had to be very careful as it bends/distorts quite easily- it's rather fragile, not terribly durable, and possibly better for smaller pieces or temporary use only."
3,As advertised,"I was expecting this to be a bit more heavy duty, however, as I am new to quilting I didn't really know what I should expect. Turns out, I didn't need it after all."
2,bent and crumpled,"The first template sent was bent and crumpled, so I sent an email stating that fact when asked to rate the merchant. A replacement was sent, but it was in worse shape than the first. I did not send in another complaint, as I figured there was almost as much smooth space on the 2 I had received than would be had on an undamaged sheet, unless I wanted a space larger than 4x4"". I would never order this again."
3,Not as informative as I wanted,"I was going on a trip to Norway, and I wanted a book with photographs of the people and the homes of Norway, not just the usual tourist destinations. I also hoped for an ""insider's scoop"" on places to go, interesting museums, and off-the-beaten-bath towns. The book had information about these things to some extent, but many of the photographs were a disappointment to me because they were pictures of unusual items, rather than of the sorts of things that are in today's Norway homes. I also hoped for more info about contemporary design. This was a pretty specific request on my part, but I did find the book a little boring overall, even if I had only wanted a general view of living in Norway."
3,This probably won't appeal to Marilyn Scott's jazz fans,"Marilyn Scott's latest CD release is a disappointment -- not because she's lost her voice but because she's moved away from her jazz fans with the tunes she's selected. Fans of contemporary pop will probably like it. I'm sorry she abandoned her jazz audience for this effort, but I realize that members of that audience, myself included, haven't supported her earlier efforts as much as we should have. I hope she'll give us another chance by returning to jazz for her next CD. She's a talented singer and deserves more recognition than she's received in the past."
4,Old standards sound great redone by Marilyn,The old songs as well as the new sound awesome as always with Marilyn Scott. She is the queen of smooth jazz female vocalists in my opinion!
3,Jump starting your life,"This is a surprisingly good self-help, motivational book. Root includes a number of helpful life coaching reminders--take risks, eat healthy, exercise--the usual stuff. Excellent recommendations.On the other hand, he also gives some advice that will make your skin crawl. Stuff like giving to charity because you'll get good publicity. There's lots of glitz and LA image material but overall the book provides a good springboard for anyone interested in jump-starting their life or simply regaining motivation."
2,Exploration of human sexuality,"This is supposed to be a film that explores human sexuality. a group of young male intellectuals and artists gets together to ask themselves tough questions about nature of love, marriage and sex. They hire two young women to take notes during the brainstorming questions. Before long, sparks start to fly and love interests between them become blurry.There is a mix of dreamlike fantasy, reality and secret desire. But film looses its heat very early and watching it is a serious effort shortly after the first 10 minutes of it."
1,A complete waste,This was the worst movie I've ever seen. The only saving grace was that I got to see Dermot Mulroney and even then it was hard to watch.
5,I ENJOYED IT,I LOVE NEVE CAMPBELL'S SHY ATTITUDE. I LIKED HER HOME GIRL'S OPPOSITE ATTITUDE. I CAN ONLY SUGGEST FOR YOU TO WATCH IT FOR YOURSELF.
3,An average book about the Vietnam War.,"I have read a number of these books about Vietnam. I respect the author's service to his country in this war. However, the book is a series of complaints about pot smokers, RAMF, and so many others. War is certainly not civil. The author served in a front line position for six months and then as a correspondent for another six months. During his six months on the front line, he spent a lot of time nursing illnesses like malaria and an infected leg.This is certainly not the best read about the Vietnam War. It is at best an average read. In addition, their were many spelling and other errors in this book. It certainly needed a proof read before going to press.The author certainly developed a very negative reaction to his time spent in this war."
2,"Superose is bitter saccharin (Sweet+Low), not yummy sucralose (Splenda)","Bad Taste! When I searched for ""liquid sucralose"", this stuff showed up, which is misleading, because this is saccharine. And it's called ""Superose"" which sounds deceptively like ""sucralose"". It never actually CLAIMS to contain sucralose, and if you read all the information, it is clearly saccharine, the bitter sweetener that became popular in the 1920s and was unfairly nearly taken off the market in the 1970s.This is the same as the generic liquid saccharine or liquid Sweet+Low found in every grocery store. Like most people, I don't like the bitter taste of saccharine as much as aspartame or sucralose. This mistaken purchase was my own fault for not reading the ingredient list more carefully. Now I will have to find a use for 12 bottles of this muck.A much better tasting product is the sucralose-based EZ-SweetzEZ-Sweetz (2oz - Liquid Sweetener 800 Servings/Bottle)"
3,Great Value,"Saccharin has been vilified in the past, but recently cleared. Structurally, it might the safest artificial sweetener around. I like the value of this product, and that it doesn't come with sugar mixed in it, like the packets and powder forms do. However, my biggets complaint is I worry about ingesting all of that paraben that is in here. It would be nice to find a bulk saccharin product, without nasty fillers and without paraben."
5,The Bible of the World,"If you are looking for full and exhaustive scriptural texts, then this isn't the book for you...HOWEVERIt is an outstanding resource for anybody studying comparative religion, as a primer for studying one of the religions included or as a general reference book for your library.""The Bible of the World"" is similar to a Reader's Digest condensed book and it containes scriptures from:Hinduism,Buddhism,Confucianism,Taoism,Zoroastrianism,Judeo-Christianity andIslam."
1,Map is shipped FOLDED!!,"The fact that the map will be shipped to you folded (in 18 squares no less)is hidden at the end of ""further details"" section. Not only is it folded, the creases are dirty. The map seems to have been lying around folded and unpackaged for some time. It can't be hung up nicely and is not worth having framed. Other web pages sell the same map for half the price when sent folded. Very dissapointed!!"
4,The best bang for the buck,"What can I say about this product, that isn't too obvious ? Not much !You get the printer cardridge and the right amount of paper for a very good price."
4,Dionne Sings Dionne II far surpasses the first.,"This compilation of newly recorded gems by Ms. Warwick is a must have for die-hard fans and for new converts. The arrangements are beautiful and they allow Ms. Warwick's, now baritone, voice to still sound strong and full. ""Then Came You"" is especially catchy with Dionne doing all her own background work. Who needs those Spinners anyway! The best tracks are ""In Between The Heartaches"" and ""The Look Of Love."" Weakest: ""What A Fool Believes."" Sorry, Dionne, I've heard Michael McDonald sing it, and he's better."
4,Dionne Is still Dionnne,"Time and cigarettes have taxed her velvety voice. But, thanks to some R&R, sucrets and water, Miss Dionne Warwick demonstrates she can still hold her own as on of the all time divas. This exclusive set of re-done oldies is nicely produced. The obscure, ""In Between The Heartaches"" is my favorite track. It even surpasses the original version recorded nearly 40 years ago!!"
3,interessant,"Dieses Buch ist wirklich interessant. Es hat keine gute Qualität und ist nicht besonders umfangreich, wofür ich ein Paar Sternchen vorenthalten muss, doch ist es in seiner Art sehr selten. Die Verwandtschaft zwischen Boxen und Bajonett kennt man sonst nur aus China und Japan. Dass auch im Westen die Verbindung erkannt und gelehrt wurde, das finde ich faszinierend. Daher sei das Werk, trotz der schlechten Qualität, Sammlern empfohlen."
1,not good,"This is just not good. The scent is off, and nothing like the perfume. The texture of the lotion is great. But the smell? No way. I would have sent it back but the shipping would not have been worth it. It is now in some thrift store. Maybe I should have tossed it. I love the perfume and was hoping to layer. Not going to happen."
1,Too Easy for my 2nd grader,"This would receive more stars if it were labeled for a 1st grader. My daughter was in public schools for kindergarten and 1st grade. We began homeschooling for 2nd grade and I felt the Charlotte Mason approach would fit our family and my daughter's needs better than other methods. I bought this mainly because it was CM and because it was listed in Cathy Duffy's homeschooling picks book. It is MUCH too easy for my daughter. It includes work that I feel is unnecessary: memorizing poems, copywork, dictation, etc. My personal opinion is that much of this is unnecessary. I am having to supplement heavily. My daughter is easily bored. It explains capitalization, definition of a sentence, definition of questions, punctuations, etc. These are all things she learned in 1st grade. As a first grade book I would give it more stars. I hope this helps some of you."
3,Poorly laid out,"I was excited to begin using this for our Charlotte Mason/Classical inspired homeschool. However, it seems to be poorly laid out. The instructions for the teacher is on the same page as the instructions and practice for the child. We have to pass the book back and forth for the things I need to read, then she needs to read, then she needs to do.If you do purchase this book, please be prepared and read the lesson ahead of time. It asks the child questions that you may or may not have already gone over (totally unrelated to grammar). For example, it had questions about the moon, but we have not gotten to our astronomy portion of our Science curriculum yet, so in the middle of grammar I am searching on the internet to have an answer for my second grader who *must* know the correct answer."
5,Great Bargain for the amount of learning material!,"This DVD is very good and keeps my toddler son's attention very well. It has some of the other Rock 'N Learn DVD material in it and for such a great price! This DVD alone has taught my son letter recognition of half the alphabet and sounding some of the letters out in only about 3 weeks..him being 19 months old. The DVD is fun, entertaining and well worth it. I bought this DVD for other family members too who have preschoolers and they all enjoy it as well! Would definitely recommend!It includes titles (all of which are on their other DVD series)1. Alphabet Al Goes to the Circus [28:55]2. Alphabet Al's Name Game [3:08]3. The Alphabet Song [1:10]4. Learn About Animals [30:10]5. Fun With Jill and Joey [13:19]6. Songs About Colors [7:55]7. Fun With Shapes [5:54]8. Practice Counting [3:59]9. Count to 20 in Spanish [4:05]10. Favorite Rhymes [19:42]"
2,Just ok,"My daughter didn't really care for this dvd. It may have been to advanced for her or she just got bored, I just found it a little boring myself. we've only watched it once and we didn't make it through the entire dvd because she lost interest."
1,Put a poker in your eye instead,"I would rather my child just never learn anything than have to watch this again. Alphabet Al is so annoying - truly, I would hate to see who didn't get the job. The production is poor in the first few numbers... It does get better. Honestly, there are much better choices out there and you will likely prevent your children from experimenting with drugs later by avoiding this DVD. It sucks."
2,So corny!,"I'm thrilled I only purchased this DVD for $5 at Target because that's about what it's worth! The graphics are so cheesy and low budget, the music is annoying, and the ""ring master"" looks like he's spent one too many days on the beach inhaling helium gas. It is horrible! If you can get past the corniness and bad quality, there is *some* educational value. But, in my opinion, there are much better DVD options than this. Elmo goes to Preschool and Signing Time's ABC DVDs are far better, very very educational, entertaining, and most importantly, will not encourage parents to pray for an aneurysm after watching the movie."
1,better stuff out there.,I was very disapointed in this DVD. Save your money this is not a very good DVD. The last few minutes is all that their is to see and it's grainy and to far off to see any thing.
1,This is terrible,"Bigfooting In OklahomaThis was my fifth Bigfoot DVD I had bought from Amazon, and it was by far the worst of the five. It was poor in all aspects. Do not buy this one!!!"
4,Fear is the manifestation in negative of faith,"fecundity means consciousnessFear is the manifestation in negative of faith.Whenever a person feel fear they are using all the techniques for creation in negative degree.The person will pronounce the words that describe their fear, will probably visualize with great clarity that which could happen to them, will feel on their body the reactions that fear produce and finally if we insist on this process the manifestation of that which is feared will very easilycome true.When the author refers to our ""home"" or holly space is an internal place. where we can trust God unconditional love andsee the bigger purpose runnig behind the scenes through which we manifest all degrees of fear."
2,Don't bother with this boring porn,"This falls in the category of boring porn. There is only one scene where the couple ""may be"" is in the air, an ugly couple doing it in a small plane.There are three other scenes where couples are in the airplane lavs. One lav doesn't look like one, the floor looks like it's in a kitchen or somewhere else in a house and the woman looks totally bored. The other two lav scenes aren't any better. The woman in the first scene is also ugly, especially when you see her teeth, yuk! There is one scene with a couple doing it in a hotel room. The woman has a great body but it isn't enough to save this scene which drags on way too long.The only part of this video that was hot was the very quick highlights at the end advertising other videos. Don't waste money on this one."
4,Great First Book/Good Sci-Fi Adventure,"Echoes is a fun little space opera with a likeable main character and quirky supporting cast. Hard core sci-fi readers might notice a few spots that run counter to logic, such as driving a hovercraft on Mars with no real description of how it would vary from driving one on Earth given the difference in gravity (Mars gravity is .38 of 1 G). Also, the characters use early 21st century idioms, but that doesn't bother me. I like reading stories that don't go out of their way to ruin regular English in an effort to create patterns that we can't really guess at.For a first book, this was very good. I look forward to Mr. Kimberlin's sophmore effort."
5,Marty Willson Piper -- Does not get better than that!,"What can I say? Marty Willson-Piper (MWP) has been around for 20+ years doing solo work and, of course, the CHURCH. This new album featuring Dare Mason is absolutely magical. I was lucky enough to see Marty in Sydney for a couple of shows recently with Tim Powles, Church's drummer plus Tracey ""bassey"" Ellis, and guitarist David Skeet. They sound cool, smooth, and eclectic.This album has it all. Great vocals, major guitars, electronics, engaging lyrics, and excellent production that just ""WORKS."" This one is for MWP and Church fans, but newcomers are welcomed and will not be disappointed. It will make you, however, drop some cash on other MWP CDs'-- I guarantee it. The good news is that you will be making a wise investment in your CD collection. It is so refreshing finding such musical gems in this day and age of ""wanna-be"" teen groups."
5,Great TFT Monitor,"I have bought a couple of boss monitors and they have great picture, because all the components are from SHARP, yes I open up one of this monitors and the lcd is sharp corp. Japan that's why they look so good."
1,lita ford in concert,"this album says release date march 2010, it really was released 2004, don't buy if you already have lita ford live album its the same songs,amazon needs to be more specific when having release dates on cd's. too bad, i thought she had a new live album."
2,2 stars.,"To escape the infamy wrought by her best selling workout novel- Workout Sex, A Girl's Guide to Home Fitness, Alexandra Clark (Sexy Lexy) fled to a small town. Hiding her prettiness as best she could under a dowdy exterior, she set out to create a new life, running a small inn in a town with no library or bookstore. However, Sam Worth wants to change that, and is working to build a new library, although one man is determined to stop him. Like Lexy, he has secrets he'd just as soon keep hidden. As soon as Lexy and Sam see each other, an inevitable slide towards one another begins. Yet, if they learn each other's secret, will their relationship be doomed? Can Lexy hide behind her plain Jane disguise forever? Though the improbable set up and contrived plot strains credibility, the author does make a point about how the any secret can cast a pall over one's life and limit your possibilities."
2,She broke rule #1...,"Okay...okay...okay... Jill Parr has a strong voice. But, every singer worth their salt knows that you never...EVER cover a song by Sting, Bono or Peter Gabriel!!!Jill actually attempts to cover ""If I Ever Lose My Faith in You"", by Sting. Unfortunately for us, it's more like karaoke than a cover. The arrangement is identical, as well as her vocal inflections. Paa-leeeeze! This is the kind of thing that makes Christian music a punchline instead of the trendsetter (I wish). (Yes, this includes Darlene Zschech doing a U2 cover on her last CD...)The other songs are fine. Just don't ever do that again..."
4,Consider yourself lucky...,"Consider yourself lucky that you've run across these speakers. I'm not an audiophile, but I like to believe I have a decerning ear for reasonable sound quality. These speakers look and sound great - I'm using as my fronts along with the ns-444 center and the onkyo sub/surrounds that came with my hts-770 HTIB. I'm very satisfied. My only negative is that, at low volume levels, the sound tends to be a little strained (that's the only word I can think to describe it). I'm convinced it's my receiver though. Looking forward to upgrading my Onkyo 520 so I can REALLY hear these bad boys shine!"
5,Great Speakers,"These speakers perform extremely well. They output pure quality sound. The High and Mid range tones are my favorites. I think the lows could have been a bit better, but pairing them with a sub-woofer compensates for the very little gap in bass. If you have or are planning on having a surround system or home theater, than you'll have a great balance once you add a sub-woofer to your speaker set, but if you plan on having these two floors speakers as your main speakers for both music and movies, then I would recommend you go with the NS-777 which output deeper lows."
5,What a twist! Great kai adventure.,"As Lone Wolf, you are dispached by the king to investigate a missing shipment of gold...ok, where have we heard this before? But hold on-the plot thickens! You journey to Ruanon, a mining province, and discover that evil again is plotting to rear it's ugly head-in the shape of Lord Vashna-the long defeated and very powerful Darklord of Naar. The Acolytes of Vashna are attempting to ressurect him, and only YOU can stop them! Grab the book and pick up the fight!"
4,Highly Recommended,"There are some EXCELLENT short stories here! They deal with subtlety, they deal with the day to day life of cowboys on the open range, they deal with love experienced but not spoken. Only one or two are overdone as far as the sex scenes. Otherwise, the several authors featured do a very credible job of how difficult a relationship can be when it's between two dominant males. What surprised me was how well the female authors did with the theme, though I don't think they are on a par with gay male writers. The book goes on my second shelf."
2,Search Engines Provide the Same Info,This information is easily found on-line using any of the reliable search engines. I will probably keep this book on hand as a back-up.
4,"Well-written, but weak punchline","This is a story about a woman following her heart ... or not. It is about the limits set upon us by our upbringing, or by ourselves, and the dilemma of whether to `blow it all sky high' for love .. or not.Well-written, witty, well-paced, but I thought the was ending a bit abrupt and weak compared to the rest of the book.Though maybe not all that likeable in her own right, I found myself feeling very sympathetic towards the heroine, Dilys, and I feel that every reader will find there's a part of Dilys they'll be able to relate to.Looking forward to reading more from Mavis Cheek."
1,I don't think so....,Please do not waste your time or money on this book unless you are in the middle of an affair. I do not see what the point would be. There is nothing even the slightest bit interesting about the way she goes about it.Better Luck to the Author next time.
3,It was okay but not compared to the stitch sampler.,It was OK but not as nicely done as the 'Stitch Sampler' done by Lucinda Ganderton. Stitch Sampler has beautiful illustrations.
5,Bead Embroidery,The projects chosen to provide visual examples of various techniques featured in this bookare are of high quality work. They stimulate the imagination and get you ready to vreate your own work. The step by step directions given to achieve learning and making many of the techniques in this book are clearly written and well supported with photogrpahs of each piece of embroidery.
5,A first-rate Ninth from a very aged Stoki,"Stokowski drew too much attention to himself to be the selfless conductor Beethoven demands, but here when he was nearly 90 he outdid his previous efforts. This is Beethoven in the grand style, and although Stoki can't resist pushing the line out of shape here and there, he avoids mannerism to deliver an exciting reading that can stand up to all but the greatest from Karajan, Toscanini, and Furtwangler.I worried about exaggerated Phase 4 sound, but the multi-miking here is not offensive. I don't think anyone would find the presentation Disneyesque. The four vocal soloists are fine, as is the admirable English chorus."
5,A FAN OF THE MAN,"Although I have never been a fan of the writing of Stephen King, Wilson's book has made me a fan of the man. With fascinating anecdotes and sharp, clean writing, Wilson draws the reader into King's life and makes clear the connections between his life and his work. The downside is that I now want to see those connections for myself, so find myself with a ton of reading to catch up on. My only hope is that King will give me a chance to catch up by not being as prolific in the future as he has been in the past. However, I do hope to see more books by Wilson in the near future. She is proof that biographies written for younger readers can be as interesting to adults as to their intended audience."
3,Melodic Hardcore,"For fans of Killswitch Engage mostly. This band takes the heavy riffs and brings a little melody to each song. Bands you can relate these guys to are Killswitch Engage and Dry Kill Logic. If you like those two bands, this is a must! Don't mind the three stars, thats incorrect, 4 is what I give this album."
5,A Core Work and a BIG DEAL,"Just noticed the review entitled Big Deal. Clearly this reader has little or no knowledge of Byzantium - or historians who have made a mark on its study. The late Sir Steven Runciman was a leading scholar - and I doubt seriously that his hand emerged from the grave to help sell this book.On the book, it remains one of the best works around the crucial events of 1453 - at least for Constantinople and what remained of the Byzantine Empire. I cannot recommend it more highly."
1,Big deal...,"when you see a book that sells 20 000 copies and has 20 reviews -beware - the authors hands are praising it and hoping for income.The only horrbile thing that come from the Fall of Constantinople was that Bulgaria ceased to exist temporarily.Regardless, it later emerged as one of the most succesfull and beautifull countries.I have been many times in Bulgaria and will tell you that it is the Switzerland of Eastern Europe. Much better than Greece or turkey."
4,The Fall of Constantinople,Interesting book on the Byzantine Empire. Some areas were a bit confusing but it eventually all made sense. I got it for my history class (we had to write a paper on it) and overall it was very informative.
5,Fifteen stars,One of THE all time great stories. A movie script would be appropriate. Can't wait to read this book again. Don't let this one go.
4,how did Konstantinople fall?,"The reviewer from Athens, Greece may not like it but this book is well balanced and is fair to all parties concerned ie Greeks, Europeans, and Ottomans. No, it does not call the Ottomans thieves, because they were not; Yes, it reminds us of the religious and ethnic tolerance the Ottomans managed some 500 years ago. It is an interesting read for those who want to educate themselves on Konstantinople and its fate."
4,Decent American prog/neo-prog,"Nice debut from a contemporary American prog band. Kinda like Marillion meets Queensryche-- but more ambitious. Very nice stuff with a standard lineup (i.e. keys, guitar, bass, drums, vocals)."
2,Lackluster,This album is very mediocre at best. So many other better bands to listen to. I have 250-300 prog and neo-prog cds and this is in the bottom 25%. Save your money.
4,Effective for small applications,effective for small applications - I frosted the glass of some wine bottles. It took longer than I had hoped (~20 min. per bottle once I figured it out but it looks good now nonetheless.
1,Didn't Work Well,"Worked o.k. for about 5 minutes, then hose clogged up. Apparently it's the humidity. But I live in Florida so humidity is a fact of life here. Guess I'll have to spring for a big rental blaster to get my job done."
1,Does not work.,"I am not being critical. But I can't get it to work. I mean it should be simple, put the hose in the bucket of sand. But it sucks nothing but air. Trashed it after one hour. Need to spend more money apparently."
3,Works but SLOW,"I ordered this product to blast paint off of a steel work bench and park bench I was restoring. This product worked very well on bare rust, but was very, very slow at removing paint. I would not have bought this product if I would have realized this. And to clarify other people's descriptions of ""large"" or ""small"" objects, this would be good for something you can hold in your hand. Anything larger will take FOREVER. In my experience, using play sand, I was able to move about one square foot an hour. It will consume about one bag of sand every 2.5 square feet...it adds up quickly. Also, this needs 9 scfm...which pretty much requires a compressor with a 60 gallon tank. Mine was only 33, so I borrowed a neighbor. A line dryer right next to the tool helps a lot with air in the lines. I would imagine this would work well for glass frosting. Hope this helps!"
4,Great for the price,"at the sake of repeating whats already been said by most: for the price its a great buy. wouldn't recommend it for big projects, but for small ones... top notch."
1,"Nice concept, poor overall design",This idea of a simple siphon sandblaster gun is an excellent one. However the implementation of this particular gun is poor. Within five minutes of use you are guaranteed to have sand caked in the tubing and a gun spraying only air. Even when using a water seperator on the hose I was still not able to get a sustainable stream of sand. The simple conclusion: this is a nice concept but a poor overall design
5,Sandblasting Kit,My husband was very pleased with the Campbell Hausfeld Sandblasting Kit. It is strong and study and we will use it often.
3,mediocre performance,"I have a large stand-up air compressor and I bought a water separator as recommended by the other reviews. Even so, I was very disappointed with the performance of this product. The gun did not shoot a steady stream of sand but, rather, it would come out in 2 second streams. I used screened and kiln dried sand in two different sizes (fine and coarse). I also tried placing the bucket of sand on the ground and elevating it above the gun. I was blasting old paint off of a trailer made of steel. In the end, I was so disappointed with the performance I had to switch to my hand held grinder."
3,Decent unit for the cost...,"This unit did a pretty clean job where I used it. It did still have some trouble siphoning, however, even after I shortened the hose. The largest drawback to this is how small the job needs to be for this to be used. If the object of blasting is very large at all, you'll be spending a lot of time with this. I ended up just paying sixty bucks and getting a larger blaster from Harbor Freight in the end. For the minimal extra cost, the time spent was reduced very substantially.For a small job, though, this is definitely a worthwhile twenty bucks to spend."
4,Not bad!,"I have just recently bought Castro's new Album, and I have to say that it is quite good...almost as good as Luis Miguel's new album! It is difficult not to admire an artist' desire to continue trying new things. The Japanese theme and musical mixture coupled with his beautiful, unique voice, is a delight to hear, and is enough to send shivers down one's spine. I am also impressed with the beautiful, flawless way he sings in English....he would no doubt make a successful crossover transition should he ever choose to.I highly recommend this album."
1,"This album is terrible, very disappointing.","I'm very disappointed with Cristian, and particolarly with this album. It looks that he's looking for the flashlight in the dark room. His attempt to rock (Gallito Feliz) is ridiculous. He was better in ""Lo mejor de mi""."
3,"Ni lo peor, ni lo mejor.","Este es un disco con variedad. QUIZAS mucha variedad. Cristian debe cantar lo que el canta mejor, las baladas fuerte que lo han hecho una estrella como: ""Volver Amar"" y ""Solo."" Canciones como ""Gallito Feliz,"" el tema en ingles ""Why,"" y el numero 12 son los temas mas peores del disco. Los discos mas fuerte son ""Este Loco Que Te Mira,"" ""Solo Pienso En Ti,"" ""No Hace Falta,"" ""Madrigal,"" y ""Mujer De Dos Caras."" Tiene una esposa tremenda!!!!"
1,disappointed,"I bought this cd on holiday in Mexico because I really enjoyed his previous ones, especially Azul. I was not able to listen to it before I purchased. I was very disappointed in this one when I did hear it. He is trying to be everything to everyone and it does not work. It hasn't worked for others and it does not work for him either. He should stick to what he does best: ballads both slow and fast. I will be sure to listen to the next one before buying. I gave the cd to one of the hotel staff,hoping that someone might like it."
1,Disappointed Cristian fan,"I was terribly disappointed with this CD. If you want a GREAT Cristian Castro CD, you should purchase ""Lo Mejor de Mi."" It truly is Cristian at his best."
3,What?,"It sounds like everyone that wrote a possitive review for this album is a close friend of cristian. The fact that most of them are in the Florida area raises suspicion, being that Cristian lives in Florida. The cd cover would make Quinten Tarantino proud!Cristian has been making good music for years and his voice is the real deal. Hey if he wants to try something new, it's his perogative. I haven't heard the new cd, but now I am curious to hear what it sounds like."
2,Industrial pick up and release magnet,"Simple design but too weak for the workforce. This is for picking up spilled paper clips or something. The handle extends too far, you will need big hands to operate this, but the price was right. I cannot use this at work."
3,Buy this one last!,"I own almost all things Sinatra. All I can say is this is a video full of gaps. I enjoy a couple of the songs on here and the medley - which I think is great.However, this is Frank trying to maintain his classic style. While at the same time attempting to stay modern. The hippie movement must have been big at this time. Glad I didn't have to live through this time period....yuck!"
5,Lots of complliments on this cologne for men,I can be in the store or at a theatre and i get constant compliments on this cologne. especially the ladies love the fragrance. use this once and you will be addicted to it. does not fade away after a couple hours. you get what you pay for with this product. definately recommend this for the gentlemen.
2,cheaper elsewhere,"I haven't played the game, but it sells for $9.99 retail. Look elsewhere to buy it."
3,Nice but not awesome,"There are dozens if not hundreds of books on the bf 109, many are jewels, truly amazing.Then there are the regular ones, this is one of them, good but far from incredible. Basically all the info in it is available online and in other cheaper books. Some of the color photos are good but also available somewhere else. If you are a completist, get it , if not, spend your bucks in somewhere else."
4,My Head is in the Blues,"This is a good old fashioned electric blues offering. It's not blues-rock, a la Stevie Ray Vaughan, but is more akin to the more traditional blues sound of B. B. King. The style is one of electric guitar and blues harp, and they drive it to perfection in the instrumental ""Hip Pocket."" Despite a uniformity of their overall sound, Fathead is able to move in several different directions on this (their second) CD. They pick up the pace with tracks like ""Commit a Crime"" and ""You're the One,"" lighten the mood with ""Walk Backwards"" and ""Mama's Boy,"" and slow it down nicely with ""Blue Water"" and the beautiful (instrumental) ""Hymn for Her."" Hopefully, Fathead is on the verge of a breakout CD. They've won a Juno, but it's time for them to get recognition from a broader audience."
2,Beware of paint failure.,"After only 30 days in the elements my box began to rust. This was in Oakland Calif. and low humidity. At the one year point, after moving to Florida, I contacted Knaack and addressed the 2 year warrantee. At this time (1 & 1/2yr) my box is a mass of running rust, the paint system has failed miserably. I still have not reached a fair resolution with Knaack regarding the warrantee. To avoid the problems I had,if your box will be exposed to constant weather, have it repainted before placing it in service. On the + side, the locking system is secure and would take a cutting torch to breach."
5,Printer ink,The best ink cartriges to get are the ones specifically made for the machine. Amazon.com has the lowest price by far.
4,HP Printer Ink,"I received this in a timely amnner. The black ink was a little messy to load, I had black ink on my fingers when I finished loading it. Otherwise, it was a smooth transaction. Had it not been for the messy problem, it would have been a perfect transaction. I would definitely purchase from this seller again!"
1,Defective,The HP printer software reported the cartridge as defective and it would not work. Not worth the trouble of returning it.
1,Do Not Buy,"I had to throw these ink cartridges away, the quality of the print was terrible, I was printing my resume and it was not legible. I thought it was my printer but I decided to go to Office Depot and buy HP ink cartridges and try those before I bought a new printer. I am so glad I did because once I put the HP ink cartridge in everything was fine. I would not waste my money on these ink cartridges again, they are half the price but do not work."
1,I never got my order,I can't rate the product because I never got it. I have attempted to contact the company without response. I will think twice before ordering online again.
2,"Items were ""remanufactured compatible"" ink cartriges NOT HP","I was disappointed with items when received. Unless I am mistaken, I was lead to believe these ink cartridges were New HP #56 and #57 cartridge combo's by the description and the posted picture. They are ""compatible"" cartridges by two different companies (not HP), and clearly state ""remanufactured"". The expiration dates were not visible. They seem to print OK but won't know how long they last till later. I feel the seller is aware it was a deceptive sale, and thus gave seller a two star rating. I'm willing to apologize if wrong."
1,not happy,"well most of the time when I use amazon it has been great with no problem, but I was sent two black hp 56 not a combo pack that was disappointing."
2,"2 1/2 Stars really, Slighty better but not by much","...P>This book was slighty better then Barron's TASP guide. The math drills have answer keys to them ... and better explaintions for the math. But it's still very lacking in the math. I suggest getting a NON-TASP math study guide instead to help you.The Reading and Writing Section of almost all books I have used are about the same all are very exceptable and useful. EXECEPT for the ""Offical TASP study guide"" which is just MEGA ALL AROUND BAD! ...I myself am returning to school after 10 years. . ... If your college has it ask to take the ACCUPLACER TEST! It's easier and less costly. ... ...I give The Best Test Prepartion for the TASP study guide 2 1/2 stars, math section is slighty better but not by much.I give Barrons TASP book 2 stars due to it's poor math section.I give The Offical TASP Study guide 0 stars! ...P>Remember take the ACCUPLACER TEST instead if your school has it!! Good luck all on your test."
2,Could have been much better.,"I must first say that it's very good to have these extremely rare soul ballad oldies on CD (I'm not aware of their being available on any other compilation or series)- however, I must also say that the sound quality on most of these songs is simply appalling (with heavy vinyl surface noise ever-present). As far as I'm concerned the label could have done a much better remastering job but this CD is hardly a poor choice if you are really into rare and obscure soul oldies. The songs by Shades of Sensation, The Determinations, The Disciples of Soul, Gin and The Gents, Intensive Heat, The Friendly People and The After Hours are this one's best."
3,More fun than you can shake a stick at (but you can try),"To many Hong Kong/China cinethusiasts (your humble reviewer being one), the presence of Amy Yip makes virtually any DVD worth a spin. I'm happy to say that Ms. Yip's ample charms aren't the only things ""Sex And Zen"" have going for it; it's a funny and sexy romp. Imagine Hong Kong martial arts wirework applied to gymnastics of another kind, all under the guise of a spiritual quest, and you'll have some idea what goodies are in store. Don't come to this film expecting the height of cinematic art, it's just lightweight, erotic fun. Turn off your mind, relax, and float downstream."
3,"chinese views on sex, as Decamerone","Like some other tales of european middleage, Sex &zen is based upon a classical book that reminds, in a certain way, to italian writer Boccaccio's ""Decamerone"". If you are looking for sex, you won't be satisfied: a part from some nude scenes, is more ironical than erotic."
5,Knack Gang Box knocks,"If this newer model is anything like the knacks of old then they are well worth the money for the professional...the door handle has been recessed which should work nicely for transport,(mine always gets bent because it protrudes), especialy along side other boxes or equipment....front access locks are a big improvement over earlier models...this allows you to line up boxes tight and still get to the lock...hopefully the gas door cylinders offer more help to lift the lid...(older models were a little weak)....All in all they are and have been a high quality product that can stand up to rough everyday use..."
5,Great novel,"Portion of back-of-book summary: ""One of the changelings' own has betrayed them. Now he sails for Ireland, ancient home of the sidhe, accompanied by the Forsworn Prince, who has three of the faerie treasures known as the Immortal Eyes. The remaining oathmates must follow in search of the fourth and final Eyestone...""Court of all Kings is conclusion to the great Immortal Eyes trilogy, and as I advise for any book series, be sure to read the first two novels (The Toybox and Shadows on the Hill) in order to get the full experience. Jackie Cassanda's storyline and characters are so absorbing that I had to make myself read slower so that I wouldn't rush through the novels. The ending of Court of all Kings was very surprising and a little sad, but overall it was a great read."
2,Smell goes away after 5 minutes,"This perfume smells amazing, but unfortunately the scent does not carry for long. When asking friends if they can smell the perfume I'm wearing the answer is always no. I my opinion it is not worth the cost, even though it smells great. You can't get a hint of L'eau D'issey after 10 minutes"
1,Not the real thing,"My wife keeps hounding me to rate this thing. I smelled it and although it does smell good, it isn't the real thing. We immediately compared it to the real bottle from sephora and there are differences. Also the scent doesn't last at all. Kind of sucks that you cant save money on this kind of luxury without getting ripped off."
1,It's been used?!,I just received today. It seemed it's been used because it's not full and there are scratches on the bottle. I highly doubt it's a brand new bottle and it's not refundable!!!
1,NOT THE REAL,"I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AND WHEN I OPENED IT, I NOTICED IT WASNT AN AUTHENTIC ISSEY PRODUCT. THIS IS MY 3RD BOTTLE OF ISSEY AND IT ISNT REALLY HARD TO NOTICE THIS WAS A FAKE. I WOULD NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN. TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT."
1,Not the real thing,"I have been using this scent for 5 years, so I KNOW what it smells like. The perfume that came LOOKED like the real one, but, when I sprayed it, it does not smell like it. I even compared it to the bottle I have and it was not the same scent. There was out scratched information on the bottom of the bottle, where the company info should be."
4,One of my favorites. Ever.,"I absolutely love this fragrance. It's pretty much my HG (fellow MUA-ers, anyone?). The tragic flaw of this one, though, is that it just doesn't last on me. I've worn it everyday for the past 2 years or so, so maybe I've just gotten so used to the smell that I no longer notice it except upon the initial application. I hope this is the case, but I've since started looking elsewhere because I do prefer a heavier scent."
5,Original And Unique,My Wife (And Mine Too) Favorite!!! And Amazon Service Is Excellent!!!!! Like Always.... You Got Me As A Loyal Customer...There's No Other Place To Shop On-Line!!!THANK YOU!!!!!
3,Best is the version for men.,"If you want a women's fragrance is better to opt for one of Carolina Herrera (just personal opinion), this fragrance compared with men's version is worse."
5,L'eau D'issey by Issey Miyake,"Smells wonderful and lasts a long time...well...at least it does on me. Every perfume smells different on each person due to body chemistry, but I think we all knew that. I urge you to try a sample in the stores before buying. In my personal opinion, it was well worth the money."
3,A nice light perfume,"Its a good light perfume,not over bearing- but does not last long; you would definitely need a retouch mid of the day,especially if you are using it as office wear. After Gucci rush I am in search of my next best perfume, and unfortunately I have to keep looking :)"
1,"Dont buy from this person, they rip you off!!!!","The bottle they sent me was filled with water and hardly had any scent to it, so it was a waste of my money, do not buy from this person!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,article has not been received by the buyer,through this I am writing to check the status of No 104-13097540512218 PURCHASE AND TRACKING NUMBER AS THE SAME 1Z038WW24376681017 has not reached its destination address agradesco PROMPT REPLY
1,Box looked like it was opened,"Not a good gift to give your wife for Christmas, the box looked like it was re-wrapped and it looked like only 2.5 onces instead of the 3.3 onces.Would not buy from this person again."
1,L'eau D'isssey by Issey Miyake had practically no scent almost odorles,"L'eau D'isssey by Issey Miyake for women did not have the same scent when bought in other stores like BURDINE'S from the US or at El Corte Ingles from Madrid, Spain or at Duty Free Airport Stores. L'eau D'isssey by Issey Miyake Spray had practically no scent it was almost odorless . Product was useless but could not be returned because Air Freight from South America to the USA would have been more expensive than the cost of product itself. We had it shipped to a friend's address while traveling to the US."
2,New or used?,"Item arrived on time and packaged well. However, item appeared to look used despite the packaging. About one inch of the perfume was missing from the top of the bottle (was not full). So not sure if I received a brand new item."
4,my conscience?,"This is an excellent product , easy to set up and pretty accurate and it makes me push myself to get my steps in because the stats are right there on my wrist. The only reason I do not give it five stars is that the watch band while waterproof and cleanable is not the most comfortable configuration with the watch. It is the only complaint I have."
2,Counts steps while i'm typing,"This is one of the ugliest watches that i've ever seen. The one that i received is all black, not the silver shown in the photo. It's HUGE and it's incredibly inacurate, it counts steps even when i'm just sitting at my desk typing. I bought a Nike+ for my ipod nano and i've been much happier with it's accuracy. This watch is shoved in a drawer somewhere collecting dust."
1,Failed out of the box,"I received this pedometer as a Christmas gift and it failed out of the box...when I went to initially configure it the display went blank. I went back to Highgear, the manufacturer, and they want me to pay to ship the defective unit back to them in addition to paying $9.75 for them to ship me the replacement unit. This means that for a $21.99 product I will have to spend $15 in shipping costs to get one that works. I have quality concerns about anything that fails out of the box so I think it's not worth the cost to get the unit replaced. Buying a different brand from REI and junking this one."
2,accurate but fragile,not for power-walkers--if it falls off your hip (which is a tendency) it's pretty much toast. until that happened to me it appeared to be accurate and reliable.
1,Ugggg!,"POOR, it registered 300+ steps while I was sitting. It was big bulky & didn't work. I would give it nagative stars if i could!"
4,pleased for price,"This product does what it advertises, and at this price, it's great. It is really big for a woman's wrist, but if you don't mind it's ugliness, it is a good product. It's easy to program using the instruction book, and on long walks, very accurate. Somewhat less so on short walks or if doing other activities, but overall give a good relative rating for a day of walking."
4,Fast Paced,This movie starts out as one of the best Abbott & Costello feature films...it kind of falls flat at the end though. The first 3/4 of the movie is fast paced with some of their funniest routines. The highlights are when they try to fix a leaky faucet & one of their funniest routines ever...also just by itself worth purchasing this film...the Susquehanna Hat Company...fabulous. Everytime I see that routine it cracks me up...a true classic. Overall this is a very good movie...the last 25 minutes could've been better though.
2,Dinner for little people,"Dinner, salad plates, and soup bowls are too small. When I first unpacked the dishes, I thought the dinner plates were salad dishes and the salad plates were the coffee cup saucers. Maybe dish sizes should be included along with the details.I have previously ordered Pfaltzgraff dinnerware and the dinner plates are a whole one inch larger than the Yorktowne sets."
5,Amazing!,This costume is absolutely amazing! The material is thick and will last through several uses. The size was perfect for my son (age 7) and it is by far the cutest costume he has ever had!
5,Better than Universal Mother,I enjoyed Sinead's first 2 albums but was bored by her cover album. Universal Mother has some beautiful moments but her incredible range of musical styles made for some jarring shifts on that album. This album is more consistent stylistically and thus more accessible.
3,Wonderful,"Perhaps her most ""radio friendly"" compilation, yet (don't read ""sell out""). Sinead is again going full force in a new direction and every listener will enjoy the ride. I listened to ""No Man's Woman"" and was inspired to sit down and write this. Finally, a worthy female anthem for the rest of us!"
3,"Not bad--but not great, either","Depending on what you're looking for, ""Faith and Courage"" is either a pleasant sixty-minute assortment of songs or a big disappointment. If you're hoping to hear your old friend Sinead--you know who I'm talking about--the singer who uses her amazing vocal range and power to belt out songs that challenge your mind while they slam you against the wall, look elsewhere. This is a mellow cd. It's the kind of music that sounds great over dinner and a glass of wine, or perhaps while driving up the freeway at night (especially ""Jealous, Healing Room, and ""The State I'm In""). It works on that level, and for that reason, I give it three stars. But if you want to rock, stick to ""The Lion and the Cobra"" or ""I Do Not Want what I Haven't Got."""
4,She's back in rocking form!,"This album is an excellent comeback for fans of Sinead's earlier work. It contains some of the energy and anger of ""Lion and the Cobra"" as well as ""I Do Not Want...""'s emotional depths. Few other artists offer as much insight into their lives as Sinead does, and this time around, she livens her lyrics up with awesome collaborators like Dave Stewart and Wyclef. Standout tracks: ""No Man's Woman,"" ""Jealous,"" ""Dancing Lessons,"" ""Daddy I'm Fine,"" ""The Lamb's Book of Life,"" and ""Kyrie Eleison"" (not a Mr. Mister cover). Overall: Excellent!"
3,"She's not just ""that bald-headed chick from Ireland""","A great album. The singles ""No Man's Woman"" is poignant and ""Jealous"" is an immaculately beautiful ballad. There are some great songs on this disc; they work even better as a collection. A great showcase of O'Connor's angelic voice. Lyrics in booklet."
4,Varied but overall strong return to music,"First to dispel a few myths about the album:1) Sinead has softened her touch, yes, however she has not lost her activist edge 2) Sinead does speak of her religion, but in her context it does not come off as preachyWhat the album is, really, is an album of edgy pop/rock. While the album is more contemporary than past work, you can still hear our old Sinead above the slick production. Asides from the brilliant lead-off single, ""No Man's Woman"", Sinead delves into humorous autobiography on the rocking ""Daddy I'm Fine"", adopts some techno on the beautiful ballad ""Hold Back The Night"", recalls wistful Roxette ballads on ""The State I'm In"", and goes back to her Irish roots in ""The Lamb's Book Of Life"". Other strong songs include ""'Til I Whisper U Something"", ""If U Ever"", and ""Kyrie Eleison"". The only dud on the album is ""Dancing Lessons"", produced by Wyclef Jean and Jerry ""Wonder"" Duplessis. Hopefully she will not work with them again."
4,Keeping up with the times,"Definitely Sinead's most commercial effort to date, it's got all the latest drumbeats, samples and synth flavors. A real departure from her last album. I like Jealous and No Man's Woman the best. Overall, still pretty great, her talent and spirit shines through. New shades of a great artist."
3,Good for the angst ridden female~myself,This album appeals to me the same way tori amos did on cold rainy days in college. Its a little too deep to introspective but still all in all a great album. What Doesn't Belong to Me is simply amazing and no mans woman is also great. But some of the songs simply don' t make any sort of impact they're just there. It's a wierd sort of easy listening for when your uterus hurts.
2,Many Things Compare to this LOL,"I loved her old song, ""Nothing Compare 2 U"", but I didn't hear anything on this album that captured the same heart and soul. I am sure she is trying, but maybe to hard. She gets an A for effort, but a C for this album. (If there were 6 stars I would give a three, but there are only five, so I give this one a 2 and a half --- right up the middle--- but the half is implied here by lack of that being a choice)"
4,YOU GOTTA BE OPEN-MINDED...,"Yes,Yes,Yes...we all know about the eccentric and moody antics that Sinead O'Connor has done in the past.But with the 2000 release of ""Faith & Courage"",Sinead proclaims that she's a new woman.No more baggage.""Faith & Courage"" was one of the more overlooked albums of 2000 by a major artist.It's a shame because Sinead really put out a diverse,passonaite,honest batch of songs in a year consisting of Britney Spears' belly button and seventeen million articles on ""Eminem's Lyrics"".Unlike most alternative/rock albums,several producers had hands on ""Faith & Courage"".From Dave Stewart to Kevin ""Shek'spare"" Briggs(the man behind TLC's ""No Scrubs"" and Destiny's Child's""Bills Bills Bills""),""Faith""'s production hues many styles but stays consistent.Among the standouts is the mellow opener ""The Healing Room"" with it's slight reggae feel,the rocking ""No Man's Woman"","
2,"Before you buy, realize this is NOT the Sinead you knew","I know some of the charms of Sinead are her ever-changing styles and themes, but at least she was always original, always interesting. This album was very disappointing--over-produced, radio-hopeful....more like background music than the kind of thing where you used to position the speakers *just right* so as to concentrate on the music, on her voice.I'd recommend listening to a friend's copy before buying. If you think you can handle a barely-recognizable pop Sinead, go for it. If you're like me, and you can't imagine why people are going bananas over an album that is easily her worst, don't bother. It's hard to resist new material, new songs, but don't fret-- for the fans of ""I Do Not Want...,"" ""Universal Mother,"" and her other albums, this is NOT Sinead O'Connor."
2,I hesitate to say this,"but after one listening, I don't want to hear it again. I got two of these for Christmas, and was looking forward to my first time hearing her new work. A longtime fan, I love ""I Do Not Want What I Have Not Got"" and the entire message of ""Universal Mother"". Her lyrics are always the most moving to me. But not this one. The lyrics are beaten to death by the irritating music. There was just no respite. All the reviews give it such a high rating that I expected so much more. While others applaud the new Sinead, I cannot agree. I want to see Sinead grow with her music, but I'm not prepared to believe in this one. Even the title seems wrong."
3,SINEAD COMES BACK AS A LESBIAN TO TRY TO SELL A FEW COPIES.,"Sineads latest effort to comeback to the Billboard Charts ""Faith & Courage"" is a good effort, though not her best by far.The first single ""No Man's Woman"" is a middle of the road pop song that basically tells you she belongs to NO MAN, and that she is a woman....okay Sinead...we know already.The rest of the CD complains, and moans about her problems with ""Daddy, Im Fine"" and ""The State I'm In""....its a good album, above average...but I get tired of Sineads problems....Now she is a lesbian...I know this is a publicity stunt...even if she is a lesbian who cares?...... Everybody is equal in my book.I just go buy music to listen to it....I don't give a darn who you sleep with. As long as you have a good product.Sinead, just continue making music, but a little better."
5,Her Best Work!,"This is my favorite CD she has ever put out. I know every word. It has helped thru rough times, and made good ones even better. Just an amazing album. This is the one. Enjoy"
2,Sinead is gone to... heaven?,"I know we're not to judge an artist (or any person, for that matter), by their religion or personal beliefs. But O'Connor's status as a pagan lesbian catholic priest is way too much and probably just a marketing scheme. The same inconsistency can be heard in her new album, an overproduced, calypso-ridden godfest for the new age. Long gone is the fierce woman with one of the strongest voices in the world. Too bad..."
3,Big fan but can't like this,"...I just can not like this new album by Sinead O'Conner ""Faith and Courage"". I wanted to, oh how I wanted to, I am the hugest fan of female vocalists, I listen to everyone from Ella Fitzgerald to Indigo Girls and vintage Sinead is fantastic. It's not her voice that is the problem here I think that it has matured fantastically, but the lyrics, oh the lyrics.I really did not realize it when I bought this this album that it was both a series of love letters to her family (sweet) and a proclamation of her pagan beliefs. The aural painting around her face on the cover should of clued me in though. It begins with the song `Healing Hands' where Sinead sings of the ... universe inside me ... to `What Doesn't Belong To Me' with her song about the goddess Isis. She talks a lot about her children does and a pretty good rock and role anthem called ""Daddy I'm fine"" it's just that the lyrics made me think that I had stumbled across a 19 year olds personal journal and I expected more."
2,I SWEAR SHE WAS GOOD!,"I don' t know what's wrong with her. She used to compose the most beautiful songs in the irish popscene, blending traditional irish themes with pop melodies. Now, she's back with a new album, after 5 years of EPs and singles, and it sounds unforgivably shallow.The lyrics are stupid in a way I never expected she would be (listen to ""Daddy, I'm Fine"" and ""Lamb's Book of Life"") the melodies are too poppy and even her voice seems to lack her original power.She co-writes most of her new songs with her producers and the results couldn't be worse. Dave Stewart (from Eurythmics) proves that he became a specialist spoiling mature women, writing and singing with her in ""Jealous"" and ""Whisper You Something"".Even the best moments (""What Doesn't Belong to Me"", ""Healing Room"") are just ok, compared to O'Connor's old songs. Please, listen to ""Universal Mother"", ""I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got"" or even ""Gospel Oak"" and you'll understand what I mean."
4,"Polished, pretty pop","Despite the ""eurhythmic"" surrounds, Sinead's voice is as true as it's ever been on this album. ""Jealous"" is by far the prettiest track, and Dave Stewart's heavy-handed though expert production serves as a beautiful atmospheric backdrop to Sinead's vocals. ""Daddy I'm Fine"" rocks and the lamb song is quite good too. Not the same old Sinead, but certainly one worth hearing."
2,bad dubbing of a great film,"The dubbing was done badly in the UK, sounded like they had 2 or 3 readers multi-tasking. Sad fate for a fantastic movie. Make sure your purchase is subtitled and unedited."
1,Horrible. Worst Feather I ever read.,"I don't even know how I managed to finish this extremely tiresome book. Neither of the main characters have any redeeming qualities. Genevieve is completely self-centered, and Dominick is an emotionless, dominating bully. The ""history"" parts are sketchy at best...the Battle of New Orleans is described in about 3 sentences, despite what the description on the back cover leads the reader to believe. There are plenty of other far more readable Feather books out there...either her writing or her editor improved vastly...so pick one of those. Don't bother with this trash."
1,Deeply disturbing,"If you want to know the truth about this deranged man, read Sexual Sabotage by Judith Reisman. Kinsey enacted a systematic assault upon the United States and beyond that has stretched into today. It is heartbreaking and horrifying that anyone would listen and try to legitimize anything written by this mad man. His research was deviant, racist, and dishonest. Nearly half of the poll of the 5,000 men he used were convicts, representing ""normal"" population. It literally makes me sick. One can only hope that the many children victimized by his twisted experimentation will one day see justice prevail, and more individuals will stand up against the evil he has unleashed on the generations."
3,Quanty????,"This food is working well for my 19 1/2 year-old-cat with kidney problems. But I can't find any info on how many cans are included for this price? I'm guessing 24 cans based on shipping weight and the price, but I won't buy without better info."
4,Would have loved it for not the horrible ending!,"Like I said, it was great. I liked Inky, except for the way she became 'dependent' on Sarendon at the end. Sarendon, well him I didn't like but their partners Lydra and Chal I did, despite the fact they weren't as strong as I would have liked them to be. Sharon Green says this is supposed to be part of a trilogy, so that does explain the abrupt ending but it still is frustrating. The other thing that frustrates me, (on the whole it's a Sharon Green problem,) is that while the focus was originally supposed to be accomplishing the mission, by the time that's done the focus is on the romance. I found that was a problem for me in 'Silken Dreams' too but maybe that's just me."
3,First time disappointed,"Sharon Green is 1 of my very favorite authors, I have all of her books & this is the 1st time I have ever been disappointed! I liked the characters a lot but disliked the book for 2 reasons. First, it takes too long to get to the action. The story doesn't get at all interesting until at least halfway thru the book & I'm sure there was much more they could have done with the vacation spots in the Mist if they'd gotten to that part sooner. 2nd was the quick & abrupt ending. I had to read the last 2-3 pages several times before I was forced to realize there wasn't any more, it just stopped suddenly & that was it. Obviously the book ended before the story did & there was supposed to be a sequel which was either never written or published (a problem with some of her other books including Hellhound Magic & Lady Blade). What a shame!"
3,Mists of Ages,"This would be one of my all time favorite books, if Sharon Green had actually written the other two books. As it is, I was rivited until the ending, where I was just devastated. I had actually grown to care about the characters, and to see the ending was heart wrenching. A better ending or sequels would have gotten five stars from me, but as it is, only three."
2,not the right size for Poulan PLN1514 14-Inch 1-1/2 HP Electric Chain Saw,"I thought I had paid attention when ordering the chain, but this chain is at least and inch if not two longer then the chain bar for this model. It says it works for a 14"" electric saw, but definitely not for this model."
3,Good informative video,"I can't say it is the best documentary. It opens my eyes. It is one of those travel channel show alike. I like cultural documentary. So I like this series. If someone knows where to get the rest of the volumes, please put your comment here."
3,"not very water-tight, low quality cover",the bowl itself is pretty. but the cover is poorly made. don't expect too much for water tightness.
3,"Fine glass, poor plastic","Fine container for a while, but the rubber cover cracks after only a short duration of use. Does anyone know whee to get extra covers?"
1,Will Break After Only a Few Washes.,"We recieved two sets of these plates as a Christmas gift last year. We've not used them very much since they seemed best for special occasions. Half(or ONE WHOLE SET!) of these dinner plates have broken since we recieved them. Two of these we found broken in the dishwasher, despite them supposedly being ""Dishwasher Safe"". The other two were broken after placing them under a hot faucet. This is just unacceptable.DO NOT BUY THESE PLATES! We have cheap plates from Wal Mart that have lasted 5+ years with no breaks like these. Will never buy this brand again."
5,Great Trike/Chopper,"My 3 year old and his 6 year old brother love this bike. It's Radio Flyer, so its well made sturdy plastic. Plus your child can grow with it. My 6 year old can also flip it without any help from an adult. This is one bike we'll probably store in the attic for when we have grandkids. It's that nice of a bike."
4,So far so good...,"I bought this for my grandson for his 2nd birthday and he loves it. This trike seems to be very well built and the conversion feature is awesome. I was looking for a ""Big Wheel"" type trike but the reviews of the new ""Big Wheels"" haven't been so good. Of course my grandson is only 2 so I guess we will see as he grows how durable this trike really is."
4,too big for younger pre-schoolers,"as a tricycle, this product sits up very high and i had been nervous of my 2-3 year old child falling over. my child is now 4 and he can maneuver it fine and i am not as concerned as i was previously. however, he does not care for the 'big wheel' version of this toy. i think this product is better for older pre-schoolers, but as older pre-schooles, children are almost ready for training wheels, so i don't know if i would purchase this again given the choice."
5,Awsome Trike!,Look no further - this is the tricycle for your child. I read some reviews and I wouldn't put a two year old on this. It's really more for 3 and up I think. My four year old daughter struggled with a traditional Hot Wheel (like Big Wheel) and we had to return it. I bought this because I always have been impressed with Radio Flyer's quality. I wasn't dissapointed. My daughter absolutely loves it. It's easy to maneuver and seems sturdier than a lot of the expensive metal tricycles that are more trend than anything....
2,Great Concept - Horrible Execution,"I have to start by saying my kids love this bike. I have a 2, a 4, and a 6 year old. They all can ride this bike because of its versatility.The problem is with the front wheel. And you can't have a working bike without a working front wheel. We bought this bike for Christmas, 2006. 3 months later, the rubber strip they call a tire, wore through, split and fell off. The plastic rim is splitting. Basically the front tire just fell apart. Our other trike, the #33 Classic Red Dual Deck Tricycle has held up just fine, with a nice solid front wheel.If your kids ride this as much as any normal, healthy, doesn't sit playing video games all day, kids do - then hold out on this one. Get something with a better front wheel or wait till they redesign this front wheel."
5,Amazing bike,"You can't go wrong with this bike. You get two bikes in one. My 3 year old boy loves both the trike and chopper version of bike and changes constantly. It is very sturdy, well made and easy to put together. My son has been happy with it since it arrived. Has not lost interest. I love the fact it will grow with him as well. Great idea Radio Flyer"
4,Return of the Quincy guys!,"I hope I'm not the only one who treasures the one-shot CBS album by Quincy, released around 1980. Of all the new-wave power pop releases of the era, that collection continues to impress me with its well-crafted, energetic and insanely catchy tunes.Well, the guiding forces behind Quincy, brothers Stephen and Brian Butler, have returned in grand style to the Beatlesque pop genre with this fine CD.Every song is lovingly performed, with the kind of tunesmithery younger bands can't seem to achieve. The brothers' harmonies are to die for.Occasionally I wish the performances weren't so laid back. At the same time, I wish the lyrics reflected a bit more of the creators' experience and maturity. I guess I'm trying to have it both ways: wishing it was 1980 again, but not wanting to relive the confusion of being 19 years old.To the Butlers, well done! To the rest of you, buy this CD. Then go see if you can find Quincy (Columbia NJC 36471)."
2,Seems to struggle...,"I've had this saw for about a year now and it I'm very dissapointed with it. It behaves as if the saw doesn't have enough power. As I'm cutting, the saw gets bogged down almost everytime I cut something substantial. I'm not talking about oak or any other hardwoods here, just regular old 2X4's! I'm stuck with it now, but wish I had bought the skil after hearing the raves about it. My old refurbished skil I bought for $29 in high school(1984) is still far superior and now this one sits and collects dust. If you're thinking blade, I tried that, doesn't seem to matter.Good luck with whatever you decide upon."
2,saw blades,can't find saw blades locally at big box storessaw one at tool store for $29.99amazon is best place to buy them but you have to wait for itif it wasn't for the blade issue i would give it a 5 stardid not like being without it
5,Pleased After 3 Years,"I have owned this saw for about 3 years now. I have found it to be very dependable. I originally purchased this saw for use as a trim saw, but have found it works well for nearly every task.2 X lumber is no problem, even at a 45 degree angle (a 5 1/2' saw will not cut 2 X stock at 45 deg.). Although I have a 7 1/4 circular saw, I find myself using this saw 99% of the time- its size and weight make it a more enjoyable tool to use. The only problem I have with this tool is that it should be offered with a case, as the larger P.C. Frame Saw's are sold."
4,Really handy,"The 345 is a well sized circular saw for most jobs. The lefthand configuration provides great access for viewing the cut (but wear safety glasses), if you're a righthanded user.On the negative side, the price tag is high and the blade selection and availability are limited. The base plate is unimpressive, similar to the sheet metal plates found on B&D; and Skil sawsI bought my 345 used for $25, so I'm quite happy. If I had paid $140~150 for a new unit, I would be much less impressed."
5,What are you thinking?,"This saw is just what it was meant to be, an excellent trim saw to rip sheet goods and cut trim to rough length. This saw can do it, butwas never meant to rip 2x material. Any contractor would not carry this saw in his truck for that use! I have owned one since 1990 or so andlove it. But, even though I use circular saws day in and day out, my saw is still like brand new. If you are a carpenter, and could only affordone circular saw, is this the saw for you? No, but it might be the second or third saw in your box. If you are a home owner looking for a good circular sawfor use around the the house, is this saw for you? Absolutly. I handy man type service use? Great saw for that. Like each and every tool in acontractors box, they all have a special use, and this saw is great at what it does. But to use it to rip 2x material.....that is likeusing a chisel for a pry bar! What are you thinking!"
5,Evans Heads are Great,It came packed very well . The correct size and product. Could not wait to go and put it on my drum set. It tuned up so well .
5,Great book to train your dog!,"Wow! What a great and easy way to train your dog! My little Westie has avoided all previous attempts to get her to ""fall in line"" but using Hodgson's techniques and a little patience my dog is now well mannered and behaved. The text is easy to read and the examples and exercises are even easier to follow.I higly recommend this book to anyone who is getting started with a new dog or trying to ""teach the old dog a new trick""!"
3,Good but could use a little more detail,"I have used Hodgson's tips to teach my 10-month Sheltie to ring a bell to go outside, to shake and to chase his tail. I have not yet been able to convince him to do much else. For example, he knows what roll over means, but begins to bark and dance around instead of doing it. I personally think he feels ""out of control"" when rolling, but there is little help in the book about how to approach things when your dog understands the command but executes it only under duress."
4,Hi-Fi Sci-Fi,"This is the least creative way to say this, but, nothing quite affects the same way as Anakuklosis does. This aggressive and poignant album encapsulates a wide variety of emotions from shear terror to an overwhelming feeling of escape. Tracks like ""There's a Fly in My Centauri Stew"" brings a feeling of anxiety, revolution, and a futuristic adrenaline rush. Recorded with a garagey DIY style, it's a little hard on the ears but in an ""in your face"" positive way. I love this record and I recommend it to anyone who loves the fired up feeling you get when you listen to classic speed metal or political punk. This record makes me want to jump into a crowd of people and scream my lungs out (again in a good way). Enjoy it's sci-fi feeling of inevitability and destruction."
5,what americans need today,"This is one of the best books that was ever written. DR. cambron was a great man. I wish i could find some of his other great books .he tells it like it is and going to be . I was lucky to be able to get my hands on this book Come LORD JESUS i had one years ago, and don't know what happen to it .it is a blessing to me . GOD BLESS YOU , FAYE JONES"
2,A bit disappointed,"I was really disappointed with this CD (HBO show)- I was wanting to listen (and remember the great times with friends, weekly HBO, with a bottle of wine . or chosmo's) and the theme show song was well - - - not there! All in all the CD is ""good"" but ~ die hard ""watchers"" want the ""real thing!"" Perhaps a ""remake!?""The movie CD (though) is great, love the first song! I would recomment this (and have bought several for friends!) to be enjoyed!"
2,"Last episode, 3/11/04 French Rap Music","I am trying to track down the French rap artist in the scene of the last episode where Carrie is in a cocktail lounge in Paris, with Mikhail B.and his Parisian friends. It was playing in the background. Anyone have a clue?Thanks for your help."
4,Bette Midler Stands Out,"Enjoyed the soundtrack...the fun stuff like Tom Jones, Coppolla, and Reiss. Also Loved Aimee Mann's song. However...Bette Midlers' sultry performance of the old Teddy Pendergrass song is a winner...a combination of Barry White, Bonnie Raitt, with a a twist of Dusty Springfield thrown in. She proves once again she can sing anything."
2,Liked the music in the series better..,"I really liked the Heart of The Matter song performed by Indie arie in the movie but this soundtrack dont have any of the songs i heard throughout the series...And to the person who posted the general list: THANK YOU!!! ive been trying to find out who sang that song at the end of the episode ""the domino effect"" and you had that on your list..so thanks..they are missing songs like Moon river which really did have a moving but sad theme to it when it was played in the episode ""i heart ny"" and the final song in the final episode, etc,etc...im glad i listened to samples before buying this cd...i would have been really disappointed...the show had some wonderful music throughout the series and this soundtrack just doesnt do it justice."
5,YOU WILL SURVIVE!!!!,More Sex and the City inspired music PLEASE! This CD collection is a funky listen to on those stay at home nights once a month. It's got some Manhattan-style girl power behind the lyrical assembly ... and defintley play this CD after a break-up. It will inspire you to run off and chase your dreams in New York or California or elsewhere.
4,"More, more, more","Okay, this a great collection of sexy tunes to accompany your idea of SEX AND THE CITY. But are you ready for the bad news? The theme song is not on here -- it's a very slow remix by GROOVE ARMADA. And if you are looking for the song ""MORE,MORE,MORE"" that they are using in the promos...it's not on here either. They have another remix which renders the song a little differently than what you are hearing on HBO. This is not a ""true soundtrack"" because none of these songs appear in the series. But if you are a fan of the artists, it is a worthy investment! I love the Missy Misdemeanor Elliot song ""Hot Boyz"". And Aimee Mann provides a poignant take on a couple that just won't work out (sort of Big and Carrie maybe) on ""Calling It Quits"". And the songs are all very good, but be warned that the music is altered from what you hear on the show."
1,Theme Song NOT on CD!,"I also bought this CD expressly for the salsa-like theme song, and was VERY disappointed to hear the sounds of traffic on city streets with some faint music in the background that was barely identifiable as the theme. It is so bad that I thought perhaps there had been an error in the production of it. The rest of the music on the CD is a waste of time. Too bad -- they could have done so much better!"
2,Why is it not possible...,"...for someone to produce an album that actually bares any kind of reflection to the series? There were some great tracks used during the six series, modern and classics tracks alike.So why are none of those here? I mean I love some of the tracks here but when where they in the show, ever?This album, to be fair, does a better job than the latter one which featured the likes of Britney Spears, I mean come on!But wouldn't it be nice to find out that some one had produced an album that was a chronological resume of all the great tracks from season one through six. Maybe then we might feel we had a ""Sex and the City"" album and were not just being cynically exploited for a fast buck!"
3,Music to chill to,"I am an avid watcher of the show, but not one of those die hard fans that know exactly what episode features each song etc. The soundtrack is pretty good, the major disappointment being the weird version of the theme song, performed by Groove Aramada. It is nothing like the normal theme, except in the first 20 seconds or so. The Tom Jones remix is excellent, and all the other songs are pretty good too. It's music to chill out to, while doing study, or reading, or whatever."
3,disappointed,"First listen, first few songs -- yikes! Finally perhaps the show had hick-upped. Until track 5-6, then a shift and things picked up. But still feel there's been better music selections they could have chosen."
1,THE LOVE TKO TRACK REMADE BY BETTE MIDDLER,"PLEASE, PLEASE MAKE THIS WOMAN STOP TRYING TO REMAKE R&B CLASSICS. SHE RUINS THEM EVERY SINGLE TIME, SHE COULD NOT DO JUSTICE TO WIND BENEATH MY WINGS, A GLADYS KNIGHT SINGLE AND NOW SHE IS MURDERING LOVE TKO! LET HER STICK TO HER SHOW TUNES, OMG, PLEASE SOMEONE STOP HER!!!!"
1,blind leading the blind,"As I understand it the groove armada song is the original and not a funny re-mix as so many other reviewers presumed. Perhaps the addition of oily fish to their diet may serve to correct these, so baffled. The groove armada song is the star on the album, alone, with poor company indeed."
3,Missing music,"There are a few songs that I can think of that aren't included, but should have been. Certain songs were powerful in their scenes; for example, when the girls went to Staten Island for the Firefighters Calendar Contest... Charlotte was so free dancing to a song (I can't think of the name) that Carrie later mentioned a line from it in conversation, ""Toot toot, beep beep"".What scene/episode did we hear ""Hot Boys"" by Missy E.? They could have done a better job picking out those songs that really stood out in episodes and could evoke a memory of that scene. I've watched the entire series from beginning to end several times and can't recall what Carrie and the girls are doing or thinking during several of these songs. Besides: wouldn't it be time for a new soundtrack, part 2? The series is over; we need more."
4,MORE MORE MORE,"Hey, for all of you out there looking for the REAL ""More More More"" songthat is played on the show promos, it is by the band The Andrea True Connection. Other than the absence of that song from this cd, it is a fairlyfun listen. I especially like Sex Bomb by Tom Jones."
1,SEX AND THE CITY,"I WAS VERY SAD, BECAUSE I BUY THIS CD WHISHING TO HEAR THE SEX AND THE CITY MAIN THEME, BUT IT WASNT. ONE OF THE TRACKS HAS THIS NAME BUT IS COMPLETE DIFERENT. I WAS VERY DISAPONTED.MANUEL"
1,Not worth it,"I was very disappointed, especially with the SATC theme song, it is not the original. Almost all the songs I don't ever recall being on the series. Save your money! I am a die hard SATC fan and sad to say I lost my money on this one, I should have read the reviews first, my mistake."
2,soundtrack without a theme song,"I buy soundtrack recordings primarily to hear the theme of the show or movie. In the case of Sex and the City, there were two variations of the Douglas Cuomo theme at the beginning and end of the show which,I don't know..I thought the producers of the cd might pick up on the fact that this is what people would like to hear. Instead we have a collection of tunes in which there are some standouts even though I haven't heard then in the show like the ballad by Trisha Yearwood and the reworking of the Gregory Issacs tune Dreams Come True. Take note producers of this cd, people buy soundtracks to hear the THEME of the show ...why else would you buy a soundtrack cd?"
2,Soundtrack question,"Over the years I have had many people email me regarding the music from Season 2's finale episode called ""Ex' And The City"". I hope this post helps some of you. I had 4 songs from my first cd, ""La Esperanza"" featured (""El Loco!"", ""Cara Mia"", ""Love & Lust"")... the last one being a song called ""La Punta"" which was the final song in that episode. I hope this helps those of you who have been searching for the music and thanks to all of you for the musical support!"
3,"Good, but too short.","I don't know if I'm like most Iona fans...their stuff is so good that I just can't seem to find enough of it. If you're a long-time Iona fan, you'll really like this DVD, but you'll also be disappointed at how short it is (about 30 minutes), and that there's not a whole lot of footage of the band playing. The interviews are good, but at best, for someone who loves Iona, this is just a teaser. And it's especially disappointing considering the price.My recommendation would be to get ahold of the ""Live in London"" DVD, a much more recent recording with tons of great concert footage, great renditions of some Iona favorites, a few new Iona songs, and good interviews with the band members."
3,Goofy ending doesn't mar the book,"Author Ngaio Marsh usually writes a pretty good mystery. There are some exceptions --Overture to DeathandDeath Dancing Footmancome to mind. However, for the most part, they're good to great. ""Singing in the Shrouds"" falls in the good camp. Roderick Alleyn goes under cover to discover who on a passenger ship is a serial killer who strangles his victims and then sprinkles flowers over them. Needless to say, Alleyn gets his man.Marsh plays fair with the reader, and you'll be guessing to the very end. The psychobabble explanation for the serial killer's motivation will seem dated and unrealistic; however, except for that, the book is a good read with believable characters and situations. I definitely recommend this one for British cozy fans."
5,Don't take this book with you on a cruise!,"The friend who loaned me this book did, and could not relax the entire time. Pretty understandable, when the premise of the novel is that there is a notorious serial killer on board a cruise ship who has an obsession with women, costume jewelry and hyacinths. Marsh's characters are all very-well drawn (at one point I almost wanted to kick the ship's captain) and the plot is flawless, with an interesting psychological angle to it."
3,Great characters and atmosphere,"Others have commented on the disparaging treatment of the camp, gay steward. Another of the characters is obviously a lesbian, and she is sympathetically written up except that the passengers comment rudely on her ""ugliness"". She is a foil, though, to the Nice Young Girl Jemima and the wonderful Mrs Dillington Blick (imagine Diana Dors in her heyday). An interesting touch is to have a priest and a psychiatrist discuss the mind of the murderer. Of the two, I'd take the priest's demonic possession over the doc's 50s Freudianism. If you enjoyed this voyage, read Marsh's Clutch of Constables."
3,Meh.,"It's okay. I read a lot of the reviews, so I knew it was a cheapo lightweight exercise thing. I was looking for something to just keep my circulation and move a little bit while I read or watch tv.The reviews are right, the tension adjuster is awful. Mine, like a few others reviewed, does make a clunk noise on every rotation. If you pedal backwards, it doesn't though. One of these days I'm going to open it up and see if I can fix the clunk, but I haven't gotten to it yet.Also, the calorie counter is laughable. I lightly pedaled (backwards because of the clunk) through a movie, and it told me I burned 700some calories over a 2.5 hr. period.SO, if you don't have high expectations, and want a cheap toy, go for it, but know that:1. The tension is not really adjustable.2. It might clunk. and3. The calorie counter is not accurate. You'll have to figure it out based on the time and by rating your own intensity."
4,Pretty good product.,"It came with all the tools needed to put it together, and it works well. The only reason it gets 4 stars is because even with the resistance knob turned all the way, there is no real resistance."
2,Too little resistance,"After stepping on it for half an hour, my legs are not even slightly tired. This machine simply has too little resistance, even on maximum resistance. It is simply not worth the money, save it for something better!"
2,It was good.,"I bought this bike few months ago, and I really liked it, but since I got the bike, it has stared to make noise. Now I am thinking to throw it out."
1,it moves all over the place,"Even on carpet i have a hard time keeping this thing in place, I had also put it against the wall with carpet below it and it had moved all around."
5,5 Fingers of Death,This movie was a great classic and it was clear and undamaged. The movie arrived in a timely fassion and I am very pleased...Thanks
5,Iron Fist,"If you are a martial arts fan and enjoy the Chinese cultural background, this was one of the best movies produced. There is a bit of fantasy involved, but still some of the best fighting scenes ever filmed. Old classical movie for collectors."
4,Five Fingers Of Pow!,"This movie is a great classic. The age of the movie itself is the only reason I did not give it 5 stars. Some places in the video are not sharp, but that is as can be expected for a movie as old as this one. The action in 5 fingers is always great, and my husband and I will probably wear out this DVD and have to try to get another one. Thank you for having this movie available. He had been wanting it for years, and now we finally have it! Some of the best fighting scenes and lines ever put into a martial arts movie is in this one. I think this is one of the best fighting films ever."
2,broke alot of new ground for this genre but! 2.5 stars,"I just didnt care much about this film for a few reasons one the fights are extremly slow i guees thats how it was back in 1974,the lighting is terrible,and the video transfer is just crap!If you want it buy it on VHS it'll be alot cheaper and the picture quality cant get no worse.This may deserve a better rating due to its ground breaking achievments but I see a film as it is. I dont pay lots of money for imported films just for sentimental value!"
2,THIS MOVIE IS SOMEWHAT OVERRATED,"A MARTIAL ARTS SCHOOL FEUDS WITH ANOTHER MARTIAL ARTS SCHOOL PRIOR TO A BIG MARTIAL ARTS TOURNAMENT. IT'S UP TO ONE STUDENT [LO LIEH] TO WIN THIS TOURNAMENT. BUT, STUDENTS FROM THE RIVAL SCHOOL STAND IN HIS WAY. THIS MOVIE IS CREDITED AS BEING THE MOVIE THAT STARTED THE MARTIAL ARTS CRAZE IN THE 70S. BUT, THIS MOVIE IS KIND OF OVERRATED. WHEN YOU CAN'T ENJOY A MOVIE BY YOURSELF, YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT MOVIE LOSES SOME CREDIBILITY. THE FIGHTS ARE OK, BUT THE MOVIE ITSELF IS HARD TO GET INTO. LO LIEH WAS OK IN THIS MOVIE. I JUST THINK IT DOESN'T DESERVE ANY MORE STARS TO THIS BEING THAT I NEED A CROWD IN ORDER TO ENJOY THIS MOVIE. UNFORTUNATELY, LO LIEH DIED IN 2002."
4,Blast from the past.,Remember the movie as a yound teen ager and wanted to get a copy of the old Kung Fu movie.
3,A Classic!,"This was the very first martial arts movie I ever saw. Since then, there have been uncountable others, but I've never forgotten this one. I thought the effects were somewhat cheesy but when I first saw it, at about age 15, it was really exciting and made a huge impact on how I saw these kinds of movies after that. If you're into the genre, I'd say this was a real collectors item."
2,disappointed,"after reading all the good reviews for this movie i bought it. what a waste of money! the story and acting may be okay and i realize its a ""classic"" but the kung fu in this movie is crap! if you want to see top shelf kung fu i HIGHLY RECOMMEND these:dance of the drunk mantismagnificent butcherwarriors twoknockaboutdrunken masterlegend of drunken masterworld of drunken masterheroes of the eastninja checkmate7 grandmasterschoy lee fut kung fushaolin temple strikes backfist of legendthese are all great!! check them out."
1,Five Fingers of Death,"I can't believe that Amazon shipped me a ""pirated movie"". The quality was so poor that the movie couldn't be watched! I have been so busy that I haven't had a chance to return the movie but will be doing so now that I'm reminded when writing this review.I wish someone would have told me how bad this pirated move was going to be and would have never purchased it!"
1,Five Fingers of Death,The original I saw years ago was a great new film the DVD that I recieved is in very poor focus and has blank spots
5,Poor Quality but Highly Entertaining,"Yes, the lighting is terrible, the dubbing is bad, and the colors look like crap too. However, this movie, in my opinion is as entertaining as kung fun cinema gets. The fight scenes are awesome (for some reason I enjoy the trampoline effect) and the plot is classic. Lo Lieh learns the Iron Fist technique and whoops some serious ass, avenging the murder of his two masters.Pick this one up, it is a winner!!"
4,"Old ""skool"" kung fu","This movie being one of the earlier ""Shaw Brothers"" production,,I must admit,,it's not bad. The cinematography, very impressive for it's time. This flick really set the trends for what we all watch today in old school kung fu, and the many techniques we now see. The fight scenes were great, and it has a really tight story,,,,they sure don't make 'em like this anymore! I gave this a 4 star even-though I've seen better, and have a collection of much better old school kung fu flicks, but for the time this flick was choregraphed,,,I am truly impressed and especially pleased with the dvd transfer. I have always knocked the "" Shaw Brothers"" production,,,but for this particular flick,,,a profound congratulations for a job well done!! I would recommend "" 5 Fingers Of Death"" for all the old school kung fu lovers out there,,,for it's time,,rest assured you will not be dissapointed!!"
2,Overloaded with sodium,"I bought one of these for work lunches. I tried one out by microwaving it for 1m 30s. At first they tasted quite good. The veggies have good color to them and are quite tasty. The chicken chunks were plentiful too. After eating about half of it, I noticed the soup base had turned watery. I would have liked it better if it was thicker.I couldn't get over the amount of sodium in it. It has two servings with 830mg (35% of daily serving) in each serving. That's 1660mg of sodium per can, 70% of your daily serving in one meal. My stomach started hurting and I had a lot of stomach acid buildup about 10 minutes after finishing it. If they have a low sodium alternative, I would go for that. I really wish food manufacturers would cut down on the amount of sodium in the food they produce."
3,Compared to original.,"I haven't purchased this yet, though I might. I'm still trying to rebuild my original Jakel motor, which is not so easy. But the thing is, the reason some say this isn't all that powerful is because the oem Jakel on Regencys operates at 3000 rpm, not 2400.That's a 25% increase."
1,Not a good buy,"The product arrived with no manual or assembly instructions. Based on the amount of bolts and nuts that came with the unit, there is a lot of assembly required. I am returning the product."
2,Sound Chip Died after an hour,"I just want to start out by saying my dog LOVED this toy and thrashed it around until he was exhausted. After about an hour of off and on playing, I could hear the sound chip starting to cut out...then silence. Sent it back to amazon for a replacement...and the sound chip in the replacement was dead on arrival (dead battery perhaps?). Sending it back for another replacement, keeping UPS in business...THIS IS FUN!"
2,lack of good sewing,"This is the FRAVORITE toy of my 6 year old Male Dalmatian.I purchased more than one of these so I can have a spare to replace the one he rips open in the first minute of play.I can no longer find these in stores (looked in no less than 10 stores locally) because a few of these stores told me that their customers also found that the toy was priced too high for such poor construction.At this time he still has a Moo Cow that has no, too small & dangerous, squeekers and no stuffing. It's Moo component still works when he shakes and tossed the toy. That's what he loves the most.I only hope he finds a new FAVORITE toy.Diane T."
2,"High Quality, But Wimpy Motor","Very nice quality and ergonomics. But the motor is so wimpy, the drill stalls often. Shop around before buying this drill."
4,Not hard to read at all!,"This book is exactly what it claims to be: ""A Beginners Guide to the Universe."" I had a vague interest in astronomy and picked up this book to see if this interest could be further developed. There was information about a wide variety of topics: the planets, telescopes, and, of course, stars. While the reading was not thrilling, it never got too specified which would have made it hard to read. There were also some nice little pieces of history here and there, which I really liked. All in all, a good basic source of information about all aspects of astronomy."
5,a great book/,when i took the book from the library i thoght it would be a real burden. I think it's the best book i have ever read and I really recommend it.The story is so sad but contains some of the greatest qotes ever. Lars is a great author that can really reach out and grab you- sometimes when you least expect it and sometimes he can really make you cry.
3,save your money,"I am a great fan of Bruce Fink whose own books give the non-clinician great insight into the clinical Lacan. He is one of those very rare Lacanians that can actually step outside the Lacanian vocabulary to say something. I was very optimistic about this new translation, however it doesn't seem to me to be a significantly better translation than the Sheridan one."
2,Latin Freak Show. Vol. 1,"From a woman's perspective, not provocative. Thought there would be couples in the video. Basically, a ""home-video"" style filming of unattractive drunk females at clubs, parties, etc. showing their privates."
5,The Catholic Church and Antisemitism Poland 1933-1939,"This is an excellent piece of very clear readable writing about a shameful period in human history. It shows how Christian anti Jewish teachings had, after 1700 of such inculcation created an environment where rounding up Jews for the crematoria was rendered very easy for Hitler's murderous armies.The author, Modras is an honest theologian and practising Catholic. His honest history writing, brimming with direct cited quotations is an indictment of the Polish Catholic clergy.The book is a cannot-put-down type of non reading, rarely encountered in non fiction.It is a must read for anyone, like myself, whose parents were Poles born in the late 19th century.AM, Melbourne"
3,Okay,"Does the job but I didn't realize that it would be sweet. I had initially thought it to be unflavored (like unflavored gelatin), but it's sweet.l Just make sure you cut down on your sugar when you do decide to use it. I used it for stabilized whipping cream, didn't really do a good job with two tablespoons. I'll try three next time."
4,Finally good fun rock has arrived!!,"as much as a fan i am of radiohead and travis its about time there was a good fun rock song and this is it! great lyrics and a very catchy guitar riff, go on buy it and party dude!"
5,Emily's Brill Review!,"This is a FANTASTIC song and so is the video! You've gotta hear it, at the mo, it's at no:2. This song has a really catchy tune that'll leave you singing for days... It's hard to realise who's singing the girl bit but it's actually a boy! This song is about a boy dreaming. He really fancies a girl at his school. He goes to the prom in his dream and suddenly (during the song)this girl walks over to him offering him 2 tickets to a Iron Maiden concert. He can't believe his luck. Then he wakes up.BRILL!!!"
1,uh.....what?,"i don't really know what everyone here is talking about. the song teenage dirtbag is not rock. it is EMO. getting a band with vocals and lyrics that whiny to sing about iron maiden is like getting an athiest to do sunday mass. it doesn't happen. and when it does, it sucks. there isn't even a guitar solo. all the instruements are backup for the vocals. that's not what rock is about. its about the music and guitar and the speed and how it all....rocks, for lack of a better word. this is just another emo kid bitching about a girl he didn't get, again."
5,A basic human right: Good Food,"This book is filled with simple, delicious recipes that come from one of the premier Italian chefs in the world. The food in this book will not baffle you and the ingredients will not empty your wallet, so these recipes are for food you can actually cook and enjoy. Tony and Giorgio believe that good food is something everyone in the world should have access to and, since Giorgio is a fabulous chef, he teaches you how to make it for yourself. If it is for a romantic dinner for yourself and your loved one, or for entertaining a group of friends, this book is full of possibilities."
4,You can go home again but it won't be the same,"Nzenza retuns to Zimbabwe after many years abroad in Australia. She brings with her a husband and child. As they learn the ropes of Zimbabwe and meet her extended family in the village, Nzenza id dealing with family members that are either dying or have died, most from AIDS. It is a touching book, composed of seperate tales, but connected stories.She speaks very clearly of her appreciation of the village and her love for the people there. At the same time she speaks from the knowledge that she can not return to live there, having spent too much time in Western cities with conveniences that the village lacks. I enjoyed the portraits of the village she paints and could easily see the picture she laid out.The stories of AIDS and it's debilitating effect on Zimbabwean life was saddening. I can only hope future portraits can touch on a Zimbabwe that has conquered this disease."
4,"Runs, trills, laughs and high notes abound.","This disc contains 15 of the 19 tracks from the 2 record set issued in 1970 - ""Joan Sutherland - French Opera Gala"". Note: all of them are contained in the 6 disc ""The Art of Joan Sutherland""Not included on this disc are (but any one of these could have been added to fill the disc):Offenbach - Les contes d'Hoffmann - Les oiseaux dans la charmilleOffenbach - La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein - Ah! que j'aime les militaires!Meyerbeer - L' Étoile du Nord - C'est bien lui ... La, la, la, air chériMeyerbeer - L' Étoile du Nord - Vaisseau que le flot balanceIts a fun collection with lots of effortless coloratura. Runs, trills, laughs and high notes abound. The more legato items are less well done. Depuis le jour lacks ecstasy. Its one recording where Joan's ""Mooning manner"" would have been well used. One only needs to hear Caballe sing Depuis le Jour to hear the difference."
2,not satisfied,"TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN.THIS PRODUCT IM SURE WOULD BE A GOOD CORDLESS MIC IF THE CHANNEL 2 WAS WORKING. IT HAS NOT WORKED SINCE I RECIEVED IT. I PURCHASED IT FOR OUR CHURCH BUT CANNOT USE IT THE WAY IT IS. I WROTE IN TWICE REGARDING THIS MATTER BUT IM WAITING ON SOME NUMBER THAT I AM SUPPOSE TO PUT ON IT TO RETURN IT. PLEASE HELP ME BECAUSE THE TIME IS WASTING AND I DONT WISH TO BE TOLD THAT IVE WAITED OVER 3O DAYS AND ITS TO LATE TO RESOLVE THIS PROBLEM. THERE SHOULD BE NOTES AND DATES TO SHOW THATT THE LAPSE OF TIME IS NOT ON MY PART.PLEASE HELP ME IN THIS MATTERRESPECTFULLY YOURS,BISHOP T MCADAMS"
5,Excellent Mic,"My son bought this item to use when he went to nursing homes. He plays the piano, but feels that the people couldn't hear him when he spoke. So, he bought this as well as a Karaoke player. The people hear him great, now. It has a nice quality sound, and he is not ""tinny"". He likes the wireless aspect as well. It was an excellent buy."
2,Cheap!,"Ok so i got the package and opened it up. The one of the antennas when folded how hits the power cord and sits out at a bad angle. After a few minutes of use it quit working because the box that holds the fuse, inside the system had broken.You have to hold the microphones very close to your mouth to use cuz the are unidirectional"
1,do not buy,"I ordered it through Amazon two months ago, I never receive the product, I e-mail them, no response. Now amazon is trying to help me to get the money back. Do not order from them.I should give them zero star from my own experience."
4,Disappointed? NO WAY!,"Being a die-hard Kid Rock fan, there's only one song that[isn't so good], ""Follow Me""."
3,Mixed Bag,"Follow Me was the main reason that i bought this album, and i have to say that no other tracks meets the same standard as this. I dont regret buying this album as there is enough to keep me happy, i just feel a bit dissapointed. My favourite tracks are Follow Me, Better Days, Yeah Yaeh Yeah and Steaks And Shrimps. I would recommend listening to this album before you purchase it."
1,uncle kracker,definately not what I expected...I liked only 1 song on this entire cd...I gave it away because I will never listen to it again...too much cussing too.
3,A good sound that doesn't quite get there,"Kid Rock's DJ steps out and makes an album on his own that sounds like, well, a bunch of Rock's B-sides. The patented Kid Rock Hard Rock-Rap is in full force and the sound is good, but the songs, for the most part don't quite kick like they do on Rock's own ""Devil."" Vocal wise Kracker is much weaker than Rock and there isn't quite as much flow. Songs like ""Heaven"" and ""Who's Your Uncle"" have great hooks and choruses but the rest of the song doesn't quite hold together. I find myself singing the chorus and getting psyched up and then when the verse kicks in going ""awe, man, they ruined it!""This CD is good, but not great. Its good some good riffs and some good songs that I can listen to, but it just doesn't get me pumped the way that listening to ""Devil"" still does every time I throw it on and crank up ""Cowboy"" or ""Wastin' Time."""
3,Could be....,This could have been an awesome CD if it did not have quite so many cuss words in it. Some of the songs are pretty good execpt for the language.It's sad that the radio stations can only play one song on this album.
1,what a piece of doo-doo,"kid rock protege makes like the backstreet boys on ""follow"". blechhh. this guy has any credibility? could he try any harder to manufacture a ""hit""?"
2,"if you're not a rap fan, don't be suckered","any non-rap fans reading these reviews, there's only 1 song on this cd that's not rap. the song ""follow me"" is a beautiful catchy pop song which i heard on the radio. after reading customer reviews saying it wasn't just like kid rock, i bought it. if you are a rap fan & want it, i'll be selling my copy shortly after i burn a copy of ""follow me""."
1,Disappointed,"I had hoped for more of the ""Follow Me"" type music. Not being a Kid Rock fan, I was disappointed with all but 3 of the songs"
1,Sample it first....,"While I like the single released for radio, the rest of the CD is ""Kracker"" rap. If you're not a fan of rap (and I'm not), don't bother buying the CD."
1,Worst CD ever?,"I was really dissapointed by Uncle Kracker's, ""Double Wide."" ""Follow Me,"" is an amazing song, but the rest of the CD is mostly rap. It's a shame Uncle Kracker wastes his time rapping, because he has much more talent as a singer."
2,Wasn't expecting the RAP songs,"The only good song on this album is ""Follow Me"". All the other songs are rap songs. So if you like rap... you might like this album."
4,Kracker - time!,"A good cd all around!1. Intro - Kracker gettin on a train...ready to go to the real world2. Better Day's - Very good rhyme3. What Chu' Lookin' At? Another hit.4. Follow Me- 1st single, my favorite5. Heaven (feat.Kidrock and Paradime)6. Steaks and Shrimp7. Who's Your Uncle8. Whiskey & Water, a good ole tune9. Yeah Yeah Yeah - 2nd Single10.Aces & 8's11.You Cant Take Me - Good Song To End The Album."
5,BUY UNCLE KRACKERS DEBUT; HIS FIRST AND BEST,"I used to own the edited version of this CD which sucked (that's all stupid Wal-Mart carried) , but I later bought the explicit one and I love it. I mean swaring isn't everything, but I can't stand hearing the bad words ""zapped"" and faded out with weird noises. The song's on here have already been reviewed so I won't get into that, but I would like to add BUY THIS!!!!!! the ""Intro"" and ""Heaven"" are by far the best songs, while ""Follow Me"" is a nice songs, it reflects something the Backstreet Boys or N'Sync would release (Very pop-orientated). BUY ""DOUBLE WIDE"" TODAY!!!"
1,Not worth the time,"The loved the song ""Follow Me"" the very first time I heard, so I bought the CD. What a shock! The rest of the songs don't even sound like the same person singing them. I bought the single of ""Follow Me"" and threw the whole CD away."
1,This is absolutely the worst CD I've ever heard.,"I own over 500 CD's, ranging from Eminem to Ani DiFranco. I like all kinds of music. So why is it that I absolutely hated this CD? The lyrics were awful. It was as if Uncle Kracker couldn't make the words fit into the song so he added F***. You can't substitute that for creativity. This CD is so bad that I won't even put it in to listen to ""Follow Me"", which is one of my all-time favorite songs."
5,"""Double Wide"" is super solid!","I bought the album to do a little music research and I am so impressed! Great hooks, great riffs and great words. Even though Kid Rock's influence is evident, I think Uncle Kracker is way better. Highly recommended if you like this type of music."
5,Kid Rock's DJ finally steps to the front!,"After well over a decade serving Kid Rock with his innovative turntable work, Kracker takes a shot as a solo artist and succeeds brilliantly. His raps are intelligent and well thought-out, (a bit less vulgarity than Kid Rock, but that could be a good thing!) and his soft, unintruding singing voice fits his southern-tinged songs nicely. Overall a very strong effort."
5,to good to ever be with kid rock,This guy couldn't of been with kid rock. Uncle Kracker is 1000X better than Kid Rock. I can't believe someone that good would work with a crackpot like Kid Rock.
5,Who's Your Uncle!,This is a VERY fine effort by Kid Rock's DJ. If you like Kid Rock's music this should be right up you ally. He is a bit mellower than K.R. and less vulgar (but he's no angel). Like K.R. the boasting is a bit much at times but the beat's and rhymes are soooo goooood it's hard to resist. My favorites are Heaven (I'm from Detroit so this one's naturally my favorite) and Who's Your Uncle. But the whole thing rock's from front to back. A classic summer record to open the sun roof and cruise down 8 mile to. Highly Recommended
4,Pop? It's not.,"Why is every teenie bopper trashing this albulm? Its because the radio only plays what they want you to hear, along with MTV,and for those teenie boopers this is, sadly, the only song they would be interested in listening to. Follow Me is one of the worst song on the CD. Thnk God I listened to the entire albulm from a friends collection or I would have missed out on owning a great CD. So if you want to hear awsome music that blends rap,rock and country ( yes, thats right, country), Buy this CD for sonds like Aces and Eights, Heaven (feat. Kid Rock), and Steaks and Shrimp, Not for that teenie booping song Follow Me, otherwise you will be just as bad as they are."
2,Depends on what style were looking for,"As for me I was looking to find more songs along the same style and tone as ""Follow Me"", the rest of the CD is more of a rap rock style with obscenities up the ying yang that isn't as catchy or singable as ""Follow Me"" When driving down teh road I prefer to crank up the Cd player, roll down the windows and sing with the music like a fool. If I do that with the rest of the rest I'll look like some prep trying to be putting it politely something I am not. Uncle Kracker should stay with that softer style I like he will sell more records and gain fans that way."
2,Pretty Interesting.,"I have to admit my first impression of Uncle Kracker was not good. He came on when I was listening to my new MI2 Soundtrack, and it didn't take long to hit next. The next time I heard him was when the ""Follow Me"" video came on. It was fun, upbeat, and popish without the backstreet boy persona. I waited to see who sang it and was shocked, thinking that there is no way it's the same person. Well, it was and to say the least I was disappointed. I checked into him and realized he was too much Kid Rock. Now, I like my metal and hard rock, but I'm not a Kid Rock fan at all. This cd has some good points like ""Follow Me"" and ""Better Days"". The songs without Kid Rock are decent, but I think he almost sounds like he's trying too hard to rap. In my opinion he'll be like Sugar Ray, if he wants to sell albums the popish way might be better. If he's in it for the music he could stay with rap and do ok, but I don't think great."
1,ICK,"I feel tricked by ""Follow Me"". What a great song Follow Me is! The rest of the CD is a huge letdown!"
5,I love it!,"I did not receive the clean version of this CD as I bought it used, however I like the music just the same. If you cannot stand the ""f"" word used about a hundred times in about half the songs, do not buy the original, get the CLEAN version. I started to send my CD back for a refund, but the songs really grew on me. The ""f"" word is not really used 100 times, but until you get used to hearing it, it is shocking. Anyways, BUY THIS CD! Especially if you are a fan of Kid Rock like I am. Uncle Kracker's music is like Kid Rock's and he can be heard on this CD as well. Cool!!!!"
4,What a song!,I knew I had to have this CD when I first heard the song follow me. It is a great song with an upbeat but mellow sound to it. I just love it and am so glad that I bought it. Definitely worth the investment.
1,"""Double Wide"": Bad first impression","""Double Wide"" just isn't good. Uncle Kracker just swears his head off for no apparent reason. ""Follow Me"" is the only thing saving his CD. It has a good beat, a nice chorus, and no swearing. ""No Stranger to Shame,"" his second album, follows the same suit as ""Follow Me"": minimal language and more actual singing, not Uncle Kracker's lame ""rapping."" ""Double Wide"" constantly makes referances to Detroit, the white ghetto. That really gets monotanous. Kid Rock comes in as producer and sings one with Uncle Kracker, but doesn't really work magic anywhere. Kracker constantly tries to build himself as some bad a**, but just strikes me as a slightly chubby nutcase. Who knew he had a wife and 2 kids? If you're intrested in Uncle Kracker, get his sophmore effort."
5,Raspberry Fantasy Spray,"Raspberry Fantasy Spray is great, I actually use it to spray around my apartment to help with cooking odors from my neighbors apartment!"
4,Works like it should!,"Was given this gun to use when another gun stopped working properly. This was during an installation of BR-111 5/16"" solid chestnut tongue in groove flooring with an osb underlayment.The gun was fairly simple to set up to match the profile of the product, took about five minutes at most.Took more air pressure (77psi vs 62psi) and was louder than the 1838K. Once the pressure was right it knocked in the 1"" staples consistently.The stamped steel safety nosepiece was kinda sharp on the edges so I took a file and dressed a light bevel on it. Always bring this gun into the work from from behind not the top so the safety doesnt leave a scratch on a finished board.It's a lightweight gun that can be used ALL day."
4,Bostitch,"As with any other Bostitch product I've owned,this product is defineitely what I needed,and priced reasonable. Would buy again,if I could ever wear it out!"
2,"everything i wanted to know ""NOT""","This was an amusing little book that was about a 20 min read start to finish.(I'm by no means a speed reader. Too much quasi-spiritual blah blah and not what I wanted to know. What I wanted to know was much more in the way of technical information and illustration, and nice photos. Nice try trying to market everything from products, to videos, classes etc etc etc. In a word this book was ""boring""."
4,The only book that will help you on your journey to locs,"I give my review this title because i haven't seen any other book available that will help anyone thinking of locking their hair the way this one offers to. It took me a year or so to make my decision and this book is one of the reasons that helped carry me along in my journey. It dispells all misconceptions about locks..and theres nothing dreadful about our hair. Gives a brief history with pictures and all. If you're looking for the how-tos or any fashion aspect of locking hair then this book is not for you. Its about knowledge, acceptance and preparing yourself for the changes that will catapult you into your path. On my first visit, my loctician handed me this book and i was proud to say that i had already read it..(didnt say how many times) The only problem i had with the book is that it was too short. It left me wanting more, but then I suppose thats a good thing. My Thanks to Sister Evans!"
1,"It's a Lock History Book, not a Locking Book","[actual rating: 1/8 a star] I wouldn't recommend this book (actually, it's more than a pamphlet) to anyone who's looking for information on lock care/how to lock. I skimmed it looking for essential info & then decided to read it because surely info on lock care had to be in there somewhere and maybe I missed it. But, no. It's OK if you're trying to build an African hair book collection and want to include it; but for those of you who are looking for some hard core practical lock care info -- it ain't in this book. I especially don't appreciate the title of the book; it's truly deceptive to those who may only read it and spend the money thinking it's going to help. I always want to support brotha & sistah writers, but I don't like to give my money away, particulary when writers cook up titles that hook those who don't have immediate access to the book."
3,Not a how - to book!!,"I recently found this book in print in a local African store. If you want to know the origin of locking and misconceptions and facts about locks then this book is for you. I read the book beginning to end in less than two hours. The book offered the four stages of hairlocking which I found most interesting. But it was a bit misleading by the title for one would think it would give instructions on how to start, maintain, and care for your locks. It does however, which I felt was a little mre important tell you how to LOVE your locked hair."
3,Interesting book but does not discuss lock care,The title of this book makes one think lock haircare will be discussed. Unfortunately it is not. Reasons why people have locks and misunderstandings about locks are listed.
4,Format & overall presentation of the info very pertinent.,"I enjoyed the basic insight provided by N. Evans. I believe I would be classified as in the 'teenage' stage of locs, and found the information & relative tips to be pretty handy. I live in Minneapolis, MN where there is a growing trend to 'lock-up'. This isn't the most diverse state, so printed info such as this book are a must read. The hairdresser at Malobe Natural Hair Salon 813 W. Lake St. 800-840-4514, (feel free to mention you heard from Montuaine), recommended this book & was not wrong in giving it rave reviews. I have been convinced to endure the early stages of locking & patiently await the look I desire."
2,Unimpressive.,"I bought this album partly because of its low price, so perhaps the quality of the music shouldn't surprise me. The cover statement ""Features 'I'll Fly Away' (from the film 'O Brother Where Art Thou')"" is deceptive; all it means is that a completely different group, the Kossoy Sisters, is singing the same (traditional) song. 'I'll Fly Away' is one of my favorite songs, so that I was completely unmoved by it is a good indicator of the rest of the album. Overall, the playing is competent but generic and uninteresting, as are the lyrics (though 'Darby Ram' stands out for being an impressively weird story set to very ordinary music). Please don't judge bluegrass by this album."
1,A total travesty!,"I feel so bad for the author, but not bad enough to keep this book. It's being returned. Although the written content is excellent, 10 of the meager 18 photos of Motherwell's work are problematic -- nine have been inadvertently cropped during the printing, and one is both cropped and printed upside down. These books should have been withdrawn and reprinted, but instead, Columbia University Press tucked a little sheet into the dust jacket explaining their regret. It's hard to believe they proceeded with the distribution of this book, and retail it for $46. This is unconscionable in any book, but especially an art book on a noted figure like Motherwell. Please note that Amazon says the other reviewer's comments are based on a different edition."
1,Is ANYONE paying attention at Columbia University Press?,"Against the advice of all three previous reviewers, because (as they note) Motherwell is so important (to me, and generally) and because from other writings I believe that Caws's take is important to understanding his importance, I purchased a ""like new"" copy of this book. At first blush the book was tight, a lovely physical thing. Then, immediately after page xi in the Preface came page xxi. Quality control at Columbia University Press, from its editors down, must be in the bottom tier of shabbiness for university presses. Shame on them. Shame, shame. I have stopped reading and am fearful to continue for further omissions and horrors I will discover (as said previous commenters have warned).One wonders, too, if Mary Ann Caws was paying much attention to the production of her book? Or was she too eager to move on to the next . . ."
4,"Meanwhile, In Sunny España...","This is a title by a Spanish gay man from Barcelona and pretty indictive of what's going on in the Spanish gay communities which is to be found in Barcelona. This author's writing is good and will (or should) be a pleasant read, especially about love which mismatches each other. There are two other titles which I would like to recommend that deals with Spain and their now progressive attitude towards gay life. They are one of the first countries in the European Commonwealth to santify gay marriage and led to the here! movie intitled ""Queens"" which can probably be ordered on DVD through Amazon; and Anthony Bidulka's, Canadian author, book ""Tapas on the Ramblas which also takes partially in Barcelona. This title I actually did order from Amazon.com in book form, so I know it is available. There will probably a whole plethora of titles, including movies on Spain and gays forthcoming."
5,Great Drill,"This drill will do anything you ask it to, and keep its charge. I can't think of anything that you could ask this drill to do and it wouldn't respond. I have used it with 1 1/4"" spade bits, 2 1/2"" hole bits and everything inbetween. It provides all the torque and power you will need without having to tote one of those 18V or new 24V beasts around. At just over 4 lbs, this is the perfect match of size and power. For the Tim Taylor do-it-yourselfer to the contractor, this is a great drill. And, the angle of the handle just seems easier to work with rather than the 90 degree angle seen on all other drills. I liken it to the difference between strait and angled finish nailers, the angled nailer is just easier to maneuver."
1,Makita 14.4 drill can't cut the mustard,"I own a home theater installation compay in Tucson and I have gone through 2 Makitas in the last 6 months. During the course of any job, I used the Makita for driving screwsand pilot hole drilling through plaster, drywall and plywood. Twice now the gears have given out and foced me to use my corded back up. I am hoping that Dewalt makes a better piece of equipment."
4,got torque?,"Don't be confused by the similar feature list of the Milwaukee, DeWalt, and Makita 14.4V drivers; there are big differences in the three products.This Makita driver delivers the right balance of torque and battery life and is therefore the winner in this class.The features work as described and then some. The trigger control is super sensitive and the brake stops the driver dead when you let your finger off the trigger. Perfect for detail work.I only have two (minor) complaints. The wrist strap that comes with the unit is cheap plastic. A cloth strap would be much appreciated when working up on a roof or ladder. I would also prefer they make the flashlight an accessory and lower the price or put in a nice set of bits."
2,Good for some,"Just returned my second Makita. First one's clutch died after 40 lag screws. Clutch will not hold up over time. However, for light homeowner use it is an excellent product. NiMH batteries are great till you price their replacements - double that of NiCD. Porter Cable here I come."
3,weak batteries,this is a good drill but the batteries do not last very well.they dont hold up as good as my 12 volt porter cable drill batteries do.
5,The Best Drill I Have Owned,"This 14.4 volt drill is very powerful and can drive over 150 three inch decks screws with one battery. The batteries are easily changeable and charge quickly. The handle is comfortable, but does cause some fatigue after prolonged use. The flashlight provides plenty of light for almost any situation. The brilliance of the bulb provides plenty of light for areas that the swivel head doesn't reach. The battery is heavy enough to make a great base. You can also place shims under one side to adjust the beam. The price is right for this drill set. I highly recommend it for the moderate and professional woodworker and builder."
3,High Torque Low Speed Drill,"Don't expect to do much drilling with this one. Yes, the battery holds up longer than most others, but this drill is geared down for torque. High speed isn't very fast. All this drill is good for is driving, so if you are looking for power, this is the drill for you.PROS** Extended life battery.** Plenty of torque.** Ergonomically balanced between pistol grip (for pushing power) and T-handle (for agility).CONS** Slow.** Moderately high priced.** A few complaints of clutch giving out."
3,Does the job.,"The drill and light work very well. Power on the drill is good and the keyless chuck/torque clutch work very well. It doesn't come with a level, however, which is a nice feature. The biggest problem I had was with the battery packs, which failed after several charges. At $79.95, they are not only expensive to replace but also hard to find."
1,Buy a DeWalt instead,I purchased this drill less than two years ago for light duty driving; the one time I pushed it I ended up burning out the switch. We use DeWalt's on the job daily and really punish them and have never seen anything like this. Very disappointed!
1,"makita cordless 6233DWBLE 3/8"" DRILL",I am not very satisfied with this tool. Not near as well made and dependable as the DeWalt 18 volt. I used it very little and it quit. I am going to try to get it fixed on the warranty.
1,poor performance,i would not buy a makita cordless drill for my own use. I have used them in the past and have found them to be poor performers and not able to stand up to continuous use. Personally my tool of choice is a Dewalt cordless
5,PICTURES FROM THE OTHER SIDE,"SO MUCH MATERIAL IS AVAILABLE ON ALLIES HISTORY OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR, BOTH WRITTEN AND PHOTOGRAPHIC. ITS EXCELLENT BOOKS LIKE THIS THAT SHOW US HOW IT WAS FOR THE OTHER SIDE. THIS PHOTOGRAPHIC BOOK OF THE TOTENKOPF DIVISION IS EXCELLENT IN ALL ASPICS AND IS PERFECT FOR THE STUDENT OF MILITARY HISTORY. I RATE THIS BOOK AS THE BEST OF ALL THE DIVISION HISTORY/PHOTO BOOKS THAT ARE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. THE SECOND WORLD WAR WAS A DARK TIME IN OUR HISTORY AND I FEEL THAT ALL SIDES SHOULD BE OBSERVED AND STUDIED, THIS BOOK FILL THE BILL. I HIGHY RECOMMEND IT."
2,nice pictures but...,I was expecting a little bit more detailed instruction. This book leaves a beginner(at least this one)a little bit at sea.
3,"Nice pictures, but disappointed with the instructions.","This book contains many beautiful paintings, but they do not include instructions on how to complete them. They are included to showcase the artist. This is fine - it makes a nice book to browse, but it leaves the student frustrated. I wanted to know how to paint the picture on the front, the garden of flowers, the pretty bay, but the instructions mostly covered beaches, grass, sea, and boats. OK, but similar in content. Ms. Penney is a very enthusiastic tutor (as I review for her later book about painting beaches), she encourages experimentation. She also feels that the finished painting is not what matters, but the journey taken. But I was left wanting more, much more."
2,flower nails,I am really disappointed with the finish on these. I ordered four and intended on using them for heat cores in my larger cakes. I am not sure if the finish has the food safe quality to use them in my cakes.
4,Good value,"As mentioned in another review, this is a really good value, considering the price and ingredients. It's a very natural, non-toxic product (rated a 1 by the Environmental Working Group's cosmetic safety database when I entered the ingredient list). It's not greasy or oily at all - in fact, it makes my skin matte! It does moisturize, although it's not quite as good at plumping up the skin as my other natural anti-aging moisturizer,Avalon Organic Botanicals CoQ10 Wrinkle Defense Creme - 1.75 fl oz. However, it is cheaper and even less toxic. I'm surprised another reviewer found it watery, as mine is a perfect consistency: thick enough to hold its form on my finger without running but not too thick that it's pasty or hard to apply at all. It does have a mild/moderate smell that my friend described as like an orange. I can't identify it myself, other than being a bit fruity."
2,"Great, but Definitely Not Reusable","These nipple covers work great - but only ONCE! So the ""Reusable"" label is not very accurate. When I first used them, they stuck on great and covered up everything. I had no issue with peeling them off either. However, 2nd time around they kept falling off since the adhesive wore off. Paying nearly $5 for a one-use product is quite expensive..."
4,Does the job,"I've worn these covers over a dozen times already and they're still holding up. They are a little more noticeable than I expected but under a thick shirt or sweater they're fine. If you wear something sheer or very thin they will definitely stand out as two puffy circle shapes on your breasts. Just as the packaging says, they get uncomfortable if you wear them for more than 8 hours. Or rather, it's uncomfortable when you finally take them off.I wash them after wearing with the hand soap by my sink and let them dry on a towel overnight. Simple, easy. This is what i was looking for."
2,Hide the nipples but bulge out visibly,Pros:stick very wellretain stickiness even after washinghide the nipples wellcons:even though it hides the nipples you can see the flower shape protrude over 2 layer of clothes. Will not recommend.
5,Under Cover....,I think they work great. They are comfortable and do the job they are meant for. I have not reason not to purchase more in the future
3,Cheap & Works unless you sweat,"My breasts are 34AA and these work pretty well. They stay on and aren't noticable unless you're wearing a very skin tight top, and even then my boyfriend said he couldn't see them.I still felt like they were visible (even though I was told they were not) and I was worried about them coming off (though they didn't). So I feel like that was more my issue than the product's.HOWEVER, they completely fell off on a really hot day (no AC or fans, 90 degree weather). I don't think they even stuck at all with all the heat and sweat."
1,Very Poor quality,"This product appeared to be very similar to a product I had purchased at Target. The adhesive is poor quality, the packaging is flimsy (Supposedly used to hold covers between wearings), very difficult to get flat on skin surface. Threw away after 2 wearings. Total waste of money."
2,Cover up but they show through,"I was very hopeful for these since they were affordable and had received excellent reviews. However, I was extremely disappointed after using them a few times. First, I could not take the plastic-y part off of the the top, which was just weird. Second, they did not taper well enough and through simple cotton shirts, I could easily see their outline. The whole point is to not draw attention to that area, and these just made me look like an alien. Only with fairly loose tops were they not visible.I will say that they covered me up nicely and I didn't have to worry about awkwardness. Except like I felt like a reverse Regina George but instead of circles cut out of my shirt, there were just visible circles underneath my shirt."
3,Ok in but only with thick clothing,"These nipple covers will cover your actual nipple only to make it look like you have even bigger nipples. These covers aren't thin enough to be worn with anything except thicker shirts. Not safe to wear them in the summer when we need them most, so we can wear our thin tanks, shirts and dresses. It would be more classier to wear a bra and let it show than nipple covers that make us look like we have enough nipple for 2 women on each breast."
2,Cover nips but show through like a huge aereola!,I have used silicone nipple covers for years but these are the worst. They are too small & thick to do the trick. Buy a larger round non-adhesive cover & you will be delighted! You sometimes sweat while you wear them but not as much as if you were wearing a bra. Amazing under gym attire & other tight fitting tops that otherwise would look provocative with nips showing.
2,not discrete enough,"They seem like they would stay put, but I never wear them because the form shows through all of my tank tops."
1,Hate these.,"There is adhesive on these, and it would be impossible to store them because of the adhesive. They don't 'cover', they make big round circles under your t-shirt, even with a nice bra. Looks horrible. I hope the adhesive isn't toxic. Promptly returned. DON'T BOTHER WITH THESE -you'll regret it if you do."
4,Works for other uses,"I bought these covers for a friend, who had a mastectomy for breast cancer. The whole idea was to minimize the effect of a hard nipple on her prosthetics, and worked like a charm. She now can use it to look like a nice lady instead a ho..y hoo..r"
5,Great value for the price.,These covers are reusable and stay just as adhesive on every wear. They are great under backless dresses and tops made of silk or another delicate material that would have showed the bulky outlines of a regular bra. Definitely a great investment for the price.
1,Whoa!,"Oh my gosh, even Bra Discs aren't this bad. These are like a cruel joke on women seeking a nipple concealment solution. They make you look like you have BIG, PROTRUDING, HARD, areolas."
2,TOO SMALL!,I have small breasts but rather large nipples. These things hardly cover you enough to stick on! You can still see your nipples poking out while wearing them. I think if they were larger they might do the job ok. They didn't stick on me too well. I even wore them at night and they fell off and I hardly move in my sleep at all. On a possitive note they are soft and comfortable when they do stay on
1,disappointed....,I wore these to a concert and LOST one......... When they were on I couldn't tell they were there... I would not buy this product just because they do not stay on. :(
2,Not for the big busted,These are not for the big busted!! I purchased these to wear with a slightly padded bra to hide my head lights. I put one on with my bra and a shirt and could hardly notice a difference between the two. I guess they are slightly better than nothing though. I will not purchase these again. The best thing is that I only spent like $6 on them.
5,"Great, Nude Color - Good Stick","I use these during modeling shoots, just in the event I am wearing a sheer material or something very low cut. It is almost the color of my skin, and it really does a good job. Just a little ""ouch"" pulling off. Sorry if this is graphic, but seems to stick and form to your skin better if applied when your nipples are hard. Can't believe I am saying that in an Amazon review, but it may be helpful to those who use them."
2,"Okay, but keep looking!","These do the job, but three complaints:1) They are quite shallow - almost flat. I prefer a slightly more concave cup; my skin perspired much more in these b/c there was no breathing room at all.2) They are very sticky to the touch! I have another pair that adheres just as well, but less sticky.3) The edges are VERY thin, almost like cellophane ... I'm not wearing super-tight clothing to need these, and the very thin edges sometimes get folded over and stuck together."
2,Poorly made,"Buyer beware. I purchased this to replace a pair that I had for over a year because the adhesive was wearing down. I purchased those from a department store and it costs $15-$20.The price for this was cheap so I decided to buy. Well, you get what you pay for. The company profile says they are a UK company but based in China. So the shipping took longer than usual because it shipped from China. When I finally received the product, it was poorly made. The adhesive is wrinkled and the silicone was so thin it did not provide any coverage. I also had to trim the adhesive around the floral design.I do not recomment this product. Pay the extra money and buy a better product."
3,They're okay....,I think they were slightly helpful and they were pretty big but for me they just didn't do the job. I must have some crazy nips but they still showed for me. :/
4,Must Haves!,"These are seriously a must have for me. As a woman with smaller breasts I almost never wear bras; these covers save me from embarrassing ""points"" showing through clothing. Would give 5 stars if they lasted forever, but the only reason they don't is because i use them constantly. For the amazon price they can't be beat!"
4,great,"It works well overall.It will totally cover budding nipples for that free naked feel. However, sometimes with think fabric it may show through and look awkward. Sometimes it starts peeling off slightly but is not in anyway coming off. It does the trick for me!"
4,Buying my 4th pair.,"I have always dreamed of a product like this. I have a different problem than most reviewers in that I am large chested. 36dd. I am loathe to buy a bra with even a tiny bit of padding as it adds to my ""girth"". However that causes obvious problems on cold days and with tight t-shirts. Voila! Nipple covers. I have used them over and over for months and they still stick. Just wash in mild soap and ready to go. I am on my 4th pair only because I keep misplacing them!! I do have to take a point away in that the outlines are sometimes visible with tight, light colored shirts. Otherwise, they are now part of my daily routine."
4,Quite nice,I like using them. I got sweaty and need to air out in summer but it's comfy. It didn't last for 50 uses like other people said though. I've only used it for 20 times at most and the glue is starting to get less sticky and it kinda drop not though not completely fell off. I'd buy them again.
2,Great coverage. Hurt like hell to take off!,"These do cover you up but they have a sort of cone shape to them once they're on and looks weird until they're in your bra. At the end of the day when it's time to take them off, you have to be extremely careful!!! They hurt so bad when peeling them--even slowly. I found that I can just deal with wearing a padded bra on a regular basis because these hurt way too bad to take off."
2,Shows right through,"These didn't work for me. I can't really say if they are comfortable or not since I did not make it out of the house with them on. You cannot see these through my regular padded t-shirt bras but I could see their outline through my fabric bras that have no padding, which is the whole reason I ordered them. I looked like I was smuggling flowers in my bra."
1,Powerful singer - Powerful Message,"Judy Jacobs is so overlooked when it comes to contemporary Christian music. The power and sincerity of her singing really has a strong effect on me. I heard her first on TBN on tv and from then on I was hooked.My favorites on the album are ""Lord God of Abraham"" and ""Almighty Reigns"" because they are so upbeat. But I also enjoyed ""Worthy"" which is a much slower tempo. The other songs are good as well."
4,attention all Dannii fans!,"Of course, if you are a Dannii fan like me, you will love this CD. There are several good songs on there from her earlier days that I just love, especially, ""All I Wanna Do"". I was unfamiliar with her work previous to ""Neon Nights"", and I'm so glad this hits collection has opened up my eyes. The 5 new tracks on the end of the CD don't disappoint either. If you aren't that familiar with Dannii, but love electronic and dance music, this is an absolute must for you. The one let-down is the bonus CD with her videos on it. A few of her more recent vids are good, but pretty much all of her older ones are rather boring and cheaply made...somewhat characteristic of European pop vids, I've found."
2,Very Disappointing.....,"This movie was a beautiful movie. However, it is not at all faithful to St. Josephine Bakhita's story. We watched the movie and we wanted to know more about this wonderful saint. When we looked her story up, it was COMPLETELY different than the storyline of the movie. The movie was very touching, but we felt ""ripped off"" by the creative license the director took. A lot of the people mentioned and portrayed in the movie didn't even exist! Bakhita had many owners, as a slave, but in the movie she just had two! Marin and Aurora, two influential characters didn't exist in real life. We felt that if the movie had to be such an emotional roller coaster, it should've been a true story. We are extremely disappointed and we don't plan on watching this untrue movie again."
5,Good movie,Good movie. got to love movies about saints! My family shores it around and we all like it. very interesting
5,On my top favorite list!,"This is a very inspiring movie on the life of St. Bakhita and one my absolute favorites. I love the approach this director takes on the religious movies he makes, which makes the films entertaining and respectful to the saint or religious topic he shows. Of course there are quite a few parts about this movie that aren't true, but let's face it, how many religious movies out there are 100% true to every fact they portray? Very few. If this movie had shown St.Bakhita in an irreverent manner, then I would have to say don't waste your money on this, BUT TRUST ME IT DOESN'T! In my opinion, the purpose of this movie isn't to show an historically true biography on her, but to take the important events in her life and show them in film in such a way that people can easier comprehend what she endured, how she lived, and how any one of us, no matter our background, or how painful our lives have been, can forgive our enemies and become a saint."
4,A must for Jennifer fans,"OK...I think this lady has the most beautiful singing voice of any female singer...period, so I'm prejudiced from the start. If you've discovered Jennifer by way of ""Famous Blue Raincoat"" or later, then you might think the earlier stuff is not quite up to par, but part of that is also due to production quality and maturity of voice. I've been a listener/fan since her ""Hair"" days and find this double album set of her earliest recordings a delight. No one has ever sung ""Just Like Tom Thumb Blues"" better nor put more feeling into Jacque Brel's ""Old Folks"". Treat yourself to some music sung by an incomparable vocalist."
2,Not as good as later work,"I am a big Jennifer Warnes fan, and my opinion is that her music has steadily improved with age - The Well being her finest CD to date. This collection is from very early in her career, and lacks the most of the talent that she has developed over the years. As a result, I was disappointed."
5,read it,"I'm only a couple of chapters in thus far, but Chang's lucid prose makes this difficult subject a pleasure to work through."
1,How many lives did he ruin?,"Yes, people do change. But must pay for his sins. And show the world what's proper. Only in United States, you can kill and be free. Be a gang and be rich. We need to draw the line somewhere. Otherwise, this country will go down big time.I can't believe I'm seeing Jesse Jackson again. He's everywhere creating more controversy. True, Thou shall not kill. But I have never seen him really do good for the society and make it more peaceful world. He thinks he has helped African American by standing up for them no matter what. He always seem to standup for killers and trouble makers. I wonder why? More news coverage? I am so tired of seeing him trying to be someone that he'll never be. He will never be Martin Luther King....so I hope he stop trying to be like MLK, the greatest human right person. Anyway, it's said that his day has come. Even though he may have changed, we have to do what's right."
1,Correction correction,"For Snag. Notre Dame is not a member of the Ivy League - they are Yale, Harvard, Princeton, Dartmouth, Brown, Columbia, Pennsylvania and Cornell."
4,Eye Opening,"Being born and raised in LA proper, and not too far from where Mr. Williams grew up, I am amazed, intrigued and enlightened."
2,Whistle Blower,"I installed the fireplace blower myself but had to confirm the wiring with the technical department at the seller. It came with instructions that were for Heatolator Unit - but this was a Canadian made knock off. After assurances on how to connect the electrical hook up, thermal switch and fan control I installed it fairly quickly. It turns on about 10 minutes after the fireplace is lit. It will remain on until the fireplace cools as well. My only problem is that it makes too much noise - it whistles even when set on the lowest speed setting. I am going to follow up with the seller tech and either fix this or hopefully return it."
2,Unhappy,"The blower was not complete and I had to improvise to install. I called the manufacturer for help, but they didn't return my call"
2,Wiser about knockoff products,"Electric Motor Warehouse's 'replacement' product resembles the Heatilator fireplace blower, but it doesn't fit, and the wiring is completely different. The extra star is for their prompt refund and customer service, but only two stars for misrepresenting the product. This product cost me $26.00 for shipping both ways. I have since purchased the Heatilator OEM blower from [...], and it fits perfectly."""
3,Lots of Action but Loses Focus,"I was excited to see another version of Kidnapped on VHS, having only seen the Disney version. Off to a good start, it quickly lost my interest as it took too many liberties with the book and made Alan Breck into a Superman character, taking on an army of British soldiers with his courage, wit, and strength. Once it crossed the line into the unbelievable I was lost and up getting a glass of tea and taking a potty break. The characters were weakly developed, as was the friendship between Alan and David. The Disney version lacked a lot of the cinematography, but was much better in developing the plot and characters. This is good for action, but weak otherwise. My advice is to read the book, and if you want a movie get the Disney classic."
1,Evening the score,"To be honest, I've never seen this. Never even heard of it. But I'm somehow scrolling through this very odd place and I see two reviews of a film starring the dancing guy in the Dr Pepper ads and both give five stars... which makes the average rating five stars. I think we all would agree, whether we've seen this film or not, it is not likely that five stars would be awarded to this film by anyone who's last name isn't Naughton.The average should be a little better now. Resume your browsing.The Powers That Be"
4,"Great tool, however it is refurbished","This is a great screw gun. I've used it to drive close to 1,000 screws so far and haven't had a bit of trouble. The comment on making sure you don't bump the nose of the gun is accurate, but outside of that I've had no issues at all.You actually can use the Senco bit in this gun, it just takes a bit of modification to the sleeve in which the bit paases through. I needed to be able to use the Senco square head bit so I disassembled the nose of the gun, matched the square head bit up with a matching size drill bit, and then made the hole just a bit larger. It worked perfectly."
3,Makita 6832m auto feed screwdriver,"Conceptually, and for the most part...works well. I do find that the angle must be perfectly perpendicular or the unit tends to kick the screws free of the belt and drops them on the floor. This unit would benefit from some sort of collar that holds the screws more securely as they are being driven."
1,"Old model, NOT WORTH THE MONEY!","This is Makita's old model, and you will most likely get a reconditioned item. The first one I got worked for 2 days then quit. The other problem is that it can only use a phillips head bit. I've talked to Makita twice now, and they don't manufacture or sell any other bits such as a square drive, etc. AND you can't return it if you're not happy with it. The only return they will do is if the unit does not work. Amazon dropped the ball on this one. The description was misleading and the item is an old obsolete model."
5,Very useful book to learn to play latin piano,"As an active musician, student and dominant in more than five instruments I picked up this book to teach myself. Haven't gone far yet but in less than 2 weeks I was able to master quite good some of the exercises. As far as the other reviewer you have to be very jeolous to accept his comment on the author of the book to afirm with him. If that's the case then I do suggest get another source of background and compare and then come with your conclusion. Otherwise the book is great not intended for a beginner. It requires knowledge of music principals and theory to be self taught. For the beginner get a teacher that will coach you through your learning, best one that has a good experience playing latin music. Good luck!!!!"
3,Don't Hate!,"Although what those 2 other reveiwers are saying is partially true. There is a difference between ""salsa"", which is a mix of several rhythems, and Son. Just like son is different from guarracha and guanguanco. ""Salsa"" was a commercial name given to the genre. But you can't deny that Nuyoricans created a new sound with instrumentation and subtle changes in the rhythems on top of the voice becoming an important part of the style. ""Salsa"" comes from Son and is similar but it is not Son. Just like boroque is not the same as romantic classical or blues as to jazz. It's quite different in subtle ways. As far as Cubans hating on PR's for ""stealing"" their rhythems. You have to remeber that PR's and Cuban's are essentially the same just diffent islands. Both have Taino with African and Spanish blood, so you can't tell me they weren't playing the same stuff in PR as well as Cuba."
3,Great book for review.,"This is a great book for review, I used that for the review of my Network+ exam, I passed the test with the use of Network+ Study guide from sybex, also the exam cram practice tests. Unfortunately, I did not have chance to use the second edition of this book, it should be out in the market soon. If you plan to take Network+, you need to get this book."
4,What you need to pass - but barely!,"Passed first try, but barely. I thought the exam was much more difficult than the practice exam in the back. I was a bit too cocky going into the test. I scored a 90%+ on the practice test and struggled on the real deal. Buy hey, pass is pass and I have to give credit to this book! I thought my CIW stuff did a much more thourough job explaining IP address classes. You can pass with just this aid but you are going to have to know it! If the system would let me give a 4.5 I would!!! ~shell in dallas (iNet+, Network+, M CIW D)"
4,A LEAN MEAN STUDY MACHINE,"I would recommend this book to anyone with existing networking background who wants to get certified. I used this book along with Network+ Exam Prep to successfully pass the test (850/900). The practice questions are a little too simple and neither book covers Unix or encryption in sufficient detail as there were a couple of questions on the test I didn't know that kept me from getting a perfect score, darn it :) After studying the mateial in these books the exam seemed fairly easy and took me less than an hour to complete (and yes, I double checked my answers)."
5,Very Good for Cramming,If you have the background this is an excelent book. It covers the test well with good explainations of what and why. I strongly recommend this book.
2,network + exam cram,"This book was very hard to read. They used lots of terms that were not defined. Usless you have a good back ground in networking you will be frustrated with this book. But then if you have the back ground you probably do not need this book. I also found lots of errors. The company site does not have an errata sheet for this book either, as they do for their others."
4,Great Book for Exam Prep,"Although I have some networking experience and an AS degree in I/T with a concentration in Networking, I read this book in about a week and a half and passed the test the first time. I highly recommend this book for beginners in the I/T industry or for those highly technical people who want this certification. My next ones will be A+, i-Net+, and then the big MSCE for W2K."
4,Network+ Exam Cram,"Very informative, very helpful book. You do need to have a basic understanding of networking to use this book though. Also, found four or five mistakes in the book, a couple on cabling, at one point they refer to SPX as connectionless ( wrong, connection-oriented ) and at least one answer to a chapter practice question wrong. ( Chapter 6, question 7, on IRQ's.). Other than that, it definitely helped me pass the test, got a 97%. I also used the Network+ Studt Guide from Sybex."
2,Not for beginners,I bought this book because I taught it would be like the Network+ Exam Prep and cram pack. But to my surprise it was not written for a beginner like me. I took the exam on the Network+ after reading the books and had no problem passing the exam. After rerading this book I was left standing with my mouth open.My advice to any one wanting to buy this who is just starting in the IT field is to think twice and look for another resource.I'll try the Exam Prep and see how it works. I really don't want to fail the exam because of lack of information. Hope this helps some one.
3,Is this book directed towards the Network+?,"I passed the Network+ exam with no problems, I was however unimpressed that allot of the material covered on the exam was not addressed in the book.I can say that I've never found any other books so focused, but it would be nice if they skim coated some areas (i.e mention other books for more info...) and included areas of the Network+ that they do not cover."
1,not sueful any more . . .,"This book is a neat book and all, but the questions are too simple compared to the actual test. I took the test today ... and passed but with no help from this book. I got most of my useful information from the examp PREP book, but not all of it. That book is better, but goes into certain details that you will NOT have to know. I would say to invest in the larger book, but not this smaller one. In fact, I would suggest not getting ANY book rated for the old test to prepare for the new network+ test form. Check out mcse.com for a good review and check out jeff richard's geocities site for good info on important areas to study. ..."
5,Another Excellent Exam Cram,This Exam Cram is another excellent resource for providing individuals with the information needed to pass the Network+ exam. I will have my employees use this book to get their Network+ certification.Brian Zortman Operations Manager Microage Computers
2,A good effort with many errors.,"Be very careful if you use this book. There are a number of serious errors. If you already know networking, you will be o.k. with this book. However, for anybody new to networking, I can not recommend this book until the publisher posts corrections."
2,Helpful but far from everything,"I studied this book completely and aced it's practice test easily and then took the Network+ exam (not the new beta) today. Based upon the reviews I read I thought I could rely upon this book and its practice exam to cover a majority of the test. Was I ever wrong. The sample test in the book probably mirrored about 20% of the real test. The remaining material and questions brushed along about at best an additional 50% of the test for those that have a GOOD background. The remaining 30% of the test I was completely on my own. I spent almost the full 90 minutes going over many of the questions I felt I wasn't comfortable enough with. I thought I was going to fail this test. This ""cram guide"" DID NOT make me feel prepared. If it were not for my background of a few years in Networking I would have failed and to be honest, I thought I had. You would expect a ""cram guide"" to be thorough in the testing material. It wasn't by a long shot."
2,Helpful but incomplete,"This book is fairly well written, but there are several areas of the test that it either leaves out or only mentions in passing. Anyone with little or no network experience will need more than this book to pass the test."
4,Exam Cram Network+,"This book helped a great deal with my Network+ test. I just passed it this morning with a 92%. It is well written and easy to read, makes a great companion to the Exam Prep & Cram Practice Tests books, I used all three & got the results I was looking for!"
2,too risky to buy,I'd like to echo the sentiments of a reader below who commented on the errors in this book. I found many -- and unfortunately there were probably some I didn't find. Given the other books on this subject (including a couple of new ones just coming out on the market) there is no reason to opt for this book.
4,I WILL ALWAYS USE EXAM CRAM,"In the 3 certifications I have taken and passed I have to give credit to the Exam Cram series. They supply you with the knowledge needed to pass and nothing more. I do recomend a more detailed book for Network + and others but read this before you take the test. I also used the Exam Cram Network+ Audio Review for the long ride to work, And the Course Technologies Guide to Network+."
4,Had most of the answers on the test,"I am not even in the networking buisness and just take the tests as a hobby. I got this book and the practice tests and passed the test. Done deal! The practice tests were a little easy compared to the real thing.Kyle A. Network+,CCNA,ATP,CFII,MEI,Helo,Jet"
3,Whats with the video,I have this unit and I cannot get the video to work. Even with the included amv converter it still says invalid file. Can anyone help with this? Otherwise a nice mp3 player
5,Very good players and service,"Excellent sevice and products, 100% recomended, if i will need other product of iliketronic, i will buy with complete security and trust. No dude."
2,Nice product but noisy!,"I wanted this bug deflector to help protect the paint on the hood of my truck and it also matches the window vents by the same manufacturer that I put on this truck. The whole package looked cool! However, after installing the bug deflector I could hear loud wind buffeting noise when on the road and it would only get worse as speed increased and was very objectionable. At first I wasn't sure the deflector was causing the problem but the noise wasn't there before installation, so after I removed it the noise was gone. I have had one of these deflectors installed on my previous truck (a Ford Ranger) and it worked great, there was no increase in noise at all on that truck. So I was very disappointed because of this. However, the product is very nice, well made and looked good on the truck, I was just disappointed that it caused so much noise. Installation was very easy, only two anchors and screws (no drilling required) and only took about 5 minutes."
4,Value for Money Sweetspot,"I've had these speakers for a little over a year now. I'm very happy with them. I have them hooked up to my Panasonic SA-XR55k receiver (another amazing value for money component) and they sound great for the money.The sub is small but definitely puts out more than enough bass for my tiny NYC apartment (also was plenty for my previous medium sized living room). It is essential that you calibrate the frequency cut-off properly on the sub - this is the first thing I would do if things sound funny. I keep my reserved for fairly low frequencies, but to each his own.Mounting the speakers was easy - 2 screws directly into the wall for each. Included white speaker cable was plenty long enough and blends nicely into the walls.I really like the piano finish on these speakers as well. Definitely scored a few wife points (and space points) with this selection.Biggest weakness would be in the midrange sounds - but this is the price you pay for satellite sub systems."
4,Good for movies,"The Yamaha NS-P436 6.1 is great for the started home theater system, and for small living rooms. The Sub is great but also not to powerful due to the smaller cone, i.e. larger the cone, lower the Hz range, better the sound's ability to pass through walls to your neighbours house. The system lacks mid-range, so a couple of front speakers might need to be the next purchases.Looks great, easy to hide - which keeps the misses happy, great for movies."
4,Great sub woofer,The size of these speackers are small. I first bought these for my main veiwing area and I liked the sound especialy from the sub. Then a pair of celetron speakers caught my eye and I bought them. I moved these speakers (minus the sub) to the bedroom with my old reciever (upgraded to a Denon). Extreamly happy with them in the bedroom because of the size and sound.
4,Makita HR3851,"The drill is okay. Ive been using a Dewalt spline for years and never had a problem with it. The Makita has locked up a couple of times during some jobs but still keeps going. I do termite treatments and drill 2 to 3 hundred 1/2"" holes in a single day with the drill. Thats alot of drilling. I would recommend this drill, and also a Dewalt d25551k which has speed control and has never locked up. The dewalt doesnt look as heavy but it packs a punch. Not that Im a big Dewalt fan but thats my opinion. Oh yeah. When my Makita came in from amazon it had no permanent Makita emblem in the plastic as if it was generic but did have a Model and Serial number so im sure its not generic just made to sell at a discount. I would buy another Makita HR3851 for what i do."
4,Decent Book.,The book had some information I was not aware of and would be a good read for someone beginning to read on WW1.Good book focusing on France and the courageous Frenchmen who fought.
5,4th and Fixed,"This is a book about football available to everybody because it doesn't capitalize on football. For those of us who remember the starry-eyed accounts of ""the gridiron game"" and other stories designed to glorify athletics that we mercifully discarded after junior high and never went back to, 4th and Fixed is an excellent return because it's suspenseful, funny, and believeable. It's great for occasional reading; excellent for a summer day; wonderful for losing yourself in. The characters: Michael Gasca and Roscoe Evans, two big-time crooks who stand to make a great deal of money if they can fix the betting on NFL wins and losses, are matched by Trevor Deale, an enterprising and resourceful quarterback whose loyalty to his teammates leads to the novel's surprising and satisfying denouement.Rivers is a master of comic timing."
3,A pitiful book that does little besides bore,"Like many other books by this same author, this book is TERRIBLE. I only read it because I was interested in Alaska and though some of the info in this book was valuable she could have made this a non-fiction sort of info book about Alaska and not have wasted my time. The plot if you could say there is one is not very good. My advice to you: do not read this book!"
3,Water Sky,"(Review by an eleven-year-old fifth-grader, who read this book for a home school assignment)Water Sky is about a boy named Lincoln who goes to Alaska to find his Uncle Jack, but ends up in a whaling camp. At the whaling camp, he learns what it's like to be an Eskimo whaler. He even comes face to face with a polar bear! Every one says he has a ""whale coming to him,"" so he tries to kill one. The rest of the book shows how he proves them right.I enjoyed the adventures in this book and I think people who like other cultures should read this book."
4,"Good book, bad ending","I loved the book. It was slightly boring in the beginning, but it got better and better. But the ending was soooo sad!!!! D: D: D: In all, it was a good book but it had a tragically bad ending."
5,"Structure, tools, and understanding permit quick use","I found this book while purchasing another book. I took a gamble and bought them both. It was the better of the two. Smith provides a structure, understanding, and tools the enable rapid implementation. This books does more than make you feel good. I am looking forward to telling others about it and putting its ideas to work."
5,Essential tool for change agents,"Rolf Smith's book is an excellent guide to the spectrum of change. I found the resistance/acceptance linkage to Myers-Briggs personality type especially powerful, helping the change agent understand who might resist the proposed change and how hard they might resist. When combined with Myers-Briggs education, I have found the 7-levels to be an effective tool for making groups aware of their inherent resistance as a preparation for embarking on the change process. In addition, the thinking tools given in the book provide some excellent ways to get ""unstuck"". I highly recommend it."
2,OK book for personal change; lacking for companies,"If you are looking for a motivational book about change, this might be what you are looking for. However, this book doesn't give a framework or model a company can follow for change, it only gives ideas and cute, practical tips for it. It's very much on the soft end. By the title and description of the book, I was expecting more in depth case studies, not cute stories."
2,Only for light use....,"I bought the 12 volt a year ago and have used it pretty heavily working on our 90 year old Victorian House. While it's a pretty handy driver, as a drill it doesn't have much muscle. I already had to have it serviced (took two weeks) because the high speed setting broke and the chuck was slipping while the gears made a screeching/ grinding noise. It has started making that noise again (after only a month), so I am giving it the heave ho and upgrading to a 14.4 Hopefully that will be a better tool. Otherwise it's no more Makitas for me."
3,Warning to listeners...,"As of today (6/29/09), the tracks posted here by Amazon are actually the tracks from Sky High's self-titled CD, and the tracks posted on the Sky High page are by Randy McStine."
3,Ideal spot,"This paperback blank journal has a simple painting on the cover of an ideal reading and thinking spot - a comfortable chair, good books and a window to the outside world. The pages within are smooth, fresh, white and ideal for the flow of thought to pen. The book is light and contains no quotes etc... I gave several to friends to record the books they've read over the years."
5,"Love, Passion, and Lust","I have never truly enjoyed photography as art, but this book captured my attention with it's raw passion and the sexually charged intrigue of each photo. Sex's taboo is broken in this book, in an artful collection of sex from the past to current."
4,not quite as good as the body,"this collection of photos isn't quite as good as his selection for the body. but there are many good photographs in it. the text of the chapters is well written and informative. some of the placement of the photos is confusing. all in all, a good book to have."
1,Disappointing,"After reading all the rave reviews I ordered this book and after flipping through it, decided to return it. Nothing was remotely inspiring. Supposedly pro, but book design and layout design amateurish. Like 2 spaces set between sentences? Save your money."
2,Too Many Errors,"I'm no math genius, but I remember enough about the concepts to spot mistakes in the math. It's a pretty bad sign when you find 2 errors in the first 70 pages of the book, and one of the errors is an incorrect solution to an equation."
5,THis IS RARE,Man this is a great single..has 3 of the awesomest KMK songs on it...and to top it of..its VERY Rare!
3,not bad,"The DVD is very informative, it covers a decent amount of information. Not the best out there though. It was a little hard to understand the narrator, and it doesn't have subtitles. That's why it gets 3 stars."
5,Does what it's supposed to do!,"The Graphtech String Trees do a way better job than the factory string trees on my Fender and Squier guitars. In the future I may buy the Graphtech nuts and saddles as well if I get around to it. In the meantime I just use pencil lead to lubricate the nut slots and bridge saddles this seems to work fine for now. Maybe one day Graphtech can make these look more like the factory original string trees that come on many guitars. All in all, I think they are a great addition to my guitar and do help my guitar to stay in tune better. I would recommend the Graphtech String Trees!"
2,Cheaper quality than I expected from graphtech,"The trees came with the injection or molding tips still on. Meaning they are just cast and shipped, no real quality control going on here."
4,One Space Living,"One Space Living is a beautifully designed and executed book. An aesthete's dream, this book showcases the amazing ideas people have for living in single - and not necessarily small - spaces. Andrew Wood's photography is both inventive and beautiful, giving a wonderful sense of space and feel. The book includes floor plans and well-written, minimalist text that manages, like the photography, to impart a feel for the spaces. The research for the text was exhaustive and the variety amazing."
3,teatime book,"most of the cases selected are rather boring and except for one luxorious apartment, all the rest doesn't really strike your attention. the photos are nice, the text is fine, but the same projects are repeated here and there from different angles, for different causes, but they are the same ""projects"" or cases as they are called. the book is not expensive though and i think the price suits the content. but it is not more than a teatime book."
3,"One space, but...","The pictures are beautiful, but since the book is called One Space Living, I wish that there were more floor plans and wide angle shots to illustrate that you are indeed looking at one space. With the close up shots, you could be looking at any bathroom or kitchen without having any idea of how they fit into the one space concept."
3,Final song IS on this CD!!!,"Im really glad I didn't read the reviews before buying the CD because I bought the CD just for that beautiful song called ""If"" in the closing credits of the movie. It IS on the Cd listed as Rochester's Farewell. And it is sung by Hilary Summers exactly as in the movie."
3,The last song in the movie,"That last song in the movie, the one that's not on the soundtrack, is called ""If"" and was originally written by Nyman for a Japanese film about Anne Frank. You can find the song on the album ""The Very Best of Michael Nyman - Film Music 1980-2001."" The vocal is by opera singer Hilary Summers."
2,Not as good as before,"I have several Nyman's records, and this maybe the worst. Music is OK with his unique style. But the recording, the recording is so bad. This CD hurts my ear and I barely stand through it. For MN's fans, collect it no doubt. For guys looking for good CDs, this is not the one. It hurts. Austin Ince is the editor and recording, you can buy this CD if you want to test it."
2,"The final, beautiful baroque song sung during closing credits isn't in the cd!","It's a pity that that beautiful song, sung during the final credits, isn't here, it was gorgeous. Does anybody know where it is taken from?ThanksLuca from Italy"
1,How depressing,"I like Nyman's work. The Piano remains one of my favorite soundtracks. It was curious that Amazon did not offer a chance to pre-listen to his The Libertine score, but I bought it anyway. When it came, neither the cover or inside art connected it with the film at all. I thought I had bought it in error. When I listened to it, I was sure of it. No resemblance to the period (Baroque) exists on any of it's tracks. True I have not yet seen the film, and considering the reviews, it is not likely to come to this market. But the music is evocative of nothing. It has no style or period. Just track after track of gloomy, meandering fingering exercises on piano with odd and really annoying staccato accents. It is the first soundtrack I have purchased in my life that did not have at least one piece to endear it to me. I plain hated it."
4,Proud as a peacock,"I love this costume. However, the medium supposedly fits sizes 6-12 but as a size 6-8, I found it a bit tight and probably should have ordered a large. The colors are bright and beautiful and for around $70, it's a great deal. It was a huge hit at our ""TV Classics"" party."
4,Unique,"I purchased this for Halloween and I can say I was definitely the only one who had it! However the tail can get in the way so if you plan on any dancing, don't bother with this costume. My only real issue was when I received the costume the gold fringing on the front was all snagged and run. Didn't look as nice as pic so it made it look cheap for the price. Not sure I would have bought it had I tried it on first. Had fun with it though."
4,A brave attempt,"When news got around that modern day (Brian Setzer? Modern Day? Oh well...) rockers would do a soundtrack consisting of Vintage Steely Dan tracks, I got rather excited - being a huge Dan-fan myself. So it is rather a disappointment to see that only half the tracks are Dan, and the rest just profits from this clever marketing ploy.However, four stars go out to anyone even attempting to re-record a Dan track. You have to have incredible self-conficence to do that, and I appreciate it. Needless to say that the original recording by messrs. Becker and Fagen remain 'the real stuff' but it's interesting to hear interpretations by people that usually play something rather different. I am pretty sure Becker and Fagen are pleased by this mini-tribute, and the songs deserve your attention.Well done. I must add that the rest of the stuff is not to my liking, but that is personal."
2,offspring?????,"Ok, i think the steely dan covers were bearable, but why the AFI cover? The original totalimmortal was so superior tot he offspring version, its not even funny. So, go buy the All Hallows ep if you want to hear how the song should be done."
3,"Nice try, but it can't compare to the originals","Well, I'll begin by saying that I didn't buy this album for any other songs except for the Steely Dan covers. I was curious as to whether these chosen bands could match the excellence set by Donald Fagen and Walter Becker in the original recordings. Of the eight, very few make the cut.Smashmouth's version of ""Do It Again"" is too short and not instrumental enough to compare to the Dan's rendition. ""Bodhisattva"" is a highlight by the Brian Setzer Orchestra, as is ""Barrytown,"" by another of my favorite bands, Ben Folds Five. The best covers are ""Only a Fool Would Say That"" and ""Reelin' in the Years."" The others aren't really worth listening to. (""Razor Boy"" is atrocious, and the version of ""Bad Sneakers"" eliminates the entire New York ambience the original set so well)If you do enjoy the music, I strongly recommend you begin purchasing the Steely Dan catelog, because the original songs are far superior to these attempts on this soundtrack."
3,AFI song turned sadly radio friendly.,"Good soundtrack overall, but this is the second time that offspring have attempted an AFI song for movie purpose (the other being ""Days of the Pheonix"" in Idel Hands) and it is the second time that justice has not been served. Offspring is a decent band but AFI is a great band, therefore it would serve offspring better make money on their own songs. Its tough for a punk band to pull off the hard core hybrid sound that only AFI has. Oh well peace out."
3,Offspring/Totalimmortal,"well the AFI version of totalimmortal is much better [I love both AFI & Offspring] but i think Offspring deserves more credit. People are making it seem like Offspring suck, and they definateley dont! I think before you listen to what people say about it, listen to both of them and decide for yourself! I gave the album a 3 out of 5 because some of the other songs werent very good...Stop putting Offspring down just because they screwed up a little... but this song WAS made for AFI..."
3,Wish it was the original Totalimmortal,"I just wanted to say I wish they'd put the original version of Totalimmortal on this instead of arbitrarily having the Offspring do an inferior cover. The original, done by AFI, is just so absolutely perfect that I don't understand why they'd want to put a cover on this, other than for the name-recognition of the Offspring I guess. Also, don't go into this expecting a bunch of lively Totalimmortal-like tracks, as other people said it's basically just randomly tossed in among other totally different songs."
2,?,"I can't say that the soundtrack really stands out any?I suppose if yur a die hard Farely bros. fan,then yeah...you'll find something about this soundtrack you'll like,if not all of it.There are a few songs seen/heard in the film that are not on the soundtrack,another to add to the,""why isn't it on here?"" list is the first scene in which Jim carey's character ""loses it"" and ""evil Hank"" first appears in line at the grocery store.I have no idea who did the music,let alone what it is called,but since it was technically a turning point in the film why was it left off the soundtrack?Well,I'll never know,maybe someone else can answer that?"
4,A New Classic,"I grew up listening to Steely Dan, so I was pretty excited to see one of my favorite bands covered in a totally new and different way. The Push Stars, who rock anyway, did a great job with ""Bad Sneakers"" and The Marvelous 3 gave ""Reelin' in the Years"" a rock edge I never thought it could have. The only thing I miss was Donald Fagan's nasal intonation and the ironic twist he gave each lyric. The Ben Folds Five version of ""Barrytown"" and Wilco's ""Any Major Dude"" - my favorite Dan song are great too. The Foo Fighers< Third Eye Blind and Ellis Paul only add more to this great CD . . .Even my mom( the woman who hooked me on Steely Dan) Loves this CD. BUY IT NOW"
3,nice try,"nice concept for an album, butit falls a bit short. The originals on the album are nice, especially the foo fighters infectious hit breakout. The brian setzer orchestra also make a nice return on this disk. As for the plethora of steely dan covers, stick to the originals folks. Smashmouth turn out their summer soundtrack attempt at a hit with ""do it again"", but thats exactly what they shouldn't have done. Leave the mastery of steely dan tunes to the originals- steely dan don't need to be interpreted by the new guys."
3,Couldve been better,"There are some good songs on this soundtrack, but ultimately I'd recommend purchasing single songs you like, or buying the artist's cd. The drums in the grocery store song is ""Fire Like This"" by Hardknox, and its exclusion from the soundtrack is the reason I didn't ultimately purchase this CD."
2,the same movie??,were these the songs in the movie??? the best ones from the movie aren't even on this cd. very disappointing.
2,The best tracks aren't on!,"Guys, for your info, two top tracks which aren't on are: ""Lit - My Own Worst Enemy"", ""Cake - Hem of your Garment"". If I bought the soundtrack expecting these I'd be disappointed. Luckily I used electronic means to check it out first!Chris."
3,"Interesting for Steelyl Dan Fans, but not worth the album","Bought the album after listening to some of the previews on the page, but wouldn't buy the whole album again.I'm a moderate Steely Dan fan and like the concept of revisioning music. Overall, I'm satisfied, but not so satisfied as to buy the album again. If you can selectively buy the tracks on the Amazon, go for it, worth a few bucks for the covers, but the other tracks were less than exciting for me.Especially look at ""Only a Fool Would Say That"" and ""Barrytown"", both good adaptations. The Brian Setzer Cover sounds just like Brian Setzer did it (which is ok, but not too original for the song) and ""Razor Boy"" had a bit of a hollow sound to it, ok but could pass."
2,What is the FIRST Hank-switch song called?!,"The one that starts up when Charlie is in the store, immediately after he lets that woman with her 2 kids with 2 full shopping carts in front of him. It sounds sort of distorted, which it is supposed to sound I think, with a lot of drums and percussion, and you hear a girl go ""Nah nah nah-nah, nah! We're gonna rock you!"". Does anyone know what the name of the song or artist is?? I cannot find that thing ANYWHERE!!! I would just love some help if anyone is more enlightened than me!!!"
3,Missing other song.,"There a song in this movie, right after jim carrey changes to hank, but its not the breakout song. Its shortly after that, when he's dunking the girl, and defecating on his neighbor's lawn. It goes,""I'm intrinsiclly no good, and i have a heart thats made of wood....and i'm not fit to touch...the hem of your garment..."" IIt's be awesome if someone could help me out. Thanks"
1,Bad soundtrack,"The only good song is on the soundrack is Breakout, the rest of it is too country (not a big fan of steely dan) but I want to know the name of the song that is ot on the ost when charlie transforms into hank, if anyone knows it pl e-mail me @ pesi55@hotmail.com, thx =)"
1,STOP CALLING IT AN OFFSPRING SONG,"Total Immortal is not an Offspring song, it is a cover of AFI, which can be found on the All Hollows Ep, which is on Nitro records(Dexter's label) so check that out, and remember it is not by Offspring."
5,Excellent,"I Gotta Say, This Soundtrack Hits Ya and it Hits Hard. I Was First Turned On To The Soundtrack When I Heard One Of The Best Songs I've ever Heard, When I Heard Cant Find The time to Tell You During The Movie. Then And There I Knew that I Need to Go Buy The Soundtrack. I Bought It Later That Day, And I Have Been Listening To It Everyday For The Last Month. So Many Great Songs Its Hard To Tell Which Is The Best, So I suggest Ya Buy The Friggin Album And Find Out.So Lemmie Steal A Line from The Movie When I sayThanks for Readin My Motherfvckin Review!"
2,Worth what I paid,"A few songs are good, it is a movie soundtrack so many songs are to fit the mood of the movie and if you've seen the movie the moods are up and down."
1,"all right, so i've never heard the soundtrack","but you guys have to get it just for the pete yorn song ""stange condition"". it's an awesome song, and it's worth a lot more than they're selling the CD for...now if you just want to get the song, get this soundtrack...if you want the song and more, get musicforthemorningafter by Pete...it's awesome, best CD of the past 5 years...go out and get anything by Pete Yorn now...before it's too late"
4,Good both for the Dan covers and the originals,"I caught this movie on HBO in a hotel recently (I totally missed in theaters) and was already enjoying when the first Steely Dan cover caught my attention, and I thought ""cool"". It only got better as movie progressed. After only hearing a few, I'd already made my mind up that I had to buy the soundtrack at my first opportunity.I think covers are analogous to lives performances by the original artist in that a good one will give you a new way to look at the original while staying true to it. I think the Steely Dan covers on this album do that admirably. This album alone has to have more Dan covers than have been released in all the years since the release of ""Can't Buy a Thrill"". I particularly liked Wilco's ""Any Major Dude"" and the SmashMouth ""Do It Again"". The Brian Setzer Orchestra's ""Bodhisattva"" pretty good, but almost too true to the original, but what are you going to do? I wish someone had covered ""My Old School""."
3,What is this song and who sings it??????,"The song that I am talking about is when he goes nuts the first time and sucks on that womens nipple...Kinda sounds like Green Day...But I am not sure...SOmething like ""I'm not fit to touch the hem on your Garment"" I think.....Help please....not on soundtrack"
3,The World ain't slowin down,"I agree with Mrs. Jones, The World Ain't Slowin Down by Ellis Paul is the best song on the soundtrack. The song caught my ear so much that I left right after the song was over and didn't see the bit at the end of the credits. I wish I would have stayed 5 more minutes"
4,Groovy Baby,I thought it was fabulous. It just captured the real theme behind the movie. I would give it four stars.
5,The transformation song...,"The song that plays when Charlie is turning into Hank (the long drum intro, the ""hard to hit a moving target"" song) is ""Fire Like This"" by Hardknox. It rules."
1,Doesn't include the most famous riff in the movie,"I bought this and couldn't believe that it didn't include the famous riff when Charlie morphs into Hank - ""Fire Like This"" by Hardknox. The rest of the songs are typical corporate pablum shoveled onto a disk that was featured in the movie for a total of 5 seconds.Not recommended"
3,Decent,"I especially love Ivy, so yeah. I have a question about one of the songs that was left off of the soundtrack (of course) . . . it's during the scene where Irene and Hank are in the car (shortly before they send it over the cliff). Kind of a love-sounding song, but I can't make out the lyrics . . . ""lying wide awake in the dark"", maybe? I'm dying to figure out what this song is!"
3,Pretty good,"Steely Dan was my first real rock concert at 13 years old. My mom and tons of cassettes in the car-- Aja, The Royal Scam, Countdown to Ecstasy.. the Dan, as they are fondly referred to, are Donald Fagen and Walter Becker, two absolute musical geniuses who made the coolest music ever.The soundtrack is a nice nod to Steely Dan, but not really a tribute. Steely Dan has always been ahead of the curve, and at least to me, a little chilly as far as an emotional factor is concerned (part of why they're so damn cool). Maybe the Farrellys thought the 'cool' factor worked. Who knows. My beef with the soundtrack is that the best song in the movie is XTC's ""I Like That,"" which took me forever to find (thanks reelsoundtrack.com!)."
1,EastBayHardCore,"Totalimmortal is not an Offspring song. The fact that so-called Offspring fans love the song that they think Offspring originally wrote is kind of funny to me. Totalimmortal is an AFI song. If you want to know how the song is really done, and done well, listen to AFI's All Hollows Ep. Offspring doesn't do Totalimmortal justice. The original AFI song is an anthem that creates a following of loyal and devoted fans. So...give credit where it is do. Go listen to the real version of the song. Im giving this soundtrack one star because there is an AFI song on it. If it were performed by AFI on the album, it would be 5."
4,Very interesting and thorough,"It is not only a how-to book, but one on the history and meanings of Sashiko and it's many designs. Her instructions are clear and concise, with several projects meant to increase your skill."
1,Very poorly written,"I decided to purchase this book because I was interested in the story of AT&T solutions. I read it cover to cover because of my interest, but the poor writing and corny side-story made it quite painful. The authors should have never used that ridiculous airplane flight as a stage for the book. Unless you have a specific interest in AT&T solutions then I wouldn't suggest purchasing this book."
1,Another tired and stale cliche from a Episcopal bishop,"As a priest in the Episcopal Church, I am always interested when another clergyman from my denomination writes anything. Despite my distate for the provocative title -- I dutifully read this book in the hope that it would not be the same, old, tired, liberal screed so many of us have come to expect from our bishops. Alas, no new arguments have been produced by Bishop Simms, and his tortured syntax and poor writing skills make his work inferior to others of his ilk. Say what you want about Bishop Spong (and believe me, I have!) at least he can write an interesting book.As for this whiney and boring book -- my advice is to save your money and donate it to your favorite charity."
1,"Why a ""Church"" Needs to get Back to Faith","Another left-wing activist 60's relic ""bishop"" using his power and prestige to spout venditive ...The discourse in the book is faux religious, with typical manipulation of Christian ""peace and justice"" principles to suit the good bishop's agenda. Meanwhile, the US Episcopal church drifts about - while its leaders, like Bishop Sims, are more concerned about using their position as a bully pulpit for their own pet notions of utopia."
5,Great Product,"My husband bought one of these for himself, and two more for gifts! He shoots archery with his brothers and he loves using this! It helps him from having to bend down and keep moving his arrows! It also comes with a cup holder so you can carry a beverage along....he loves it!"
5,Precision and Power,"Before I purchased this combo , I looked at all the others , 14.4 volt and 18 volt and up . The only saw I found that had a stable base that was flat , by stable I mean the saw body does not move from side to side and the base stays still , was the makita , also the base is flat and does not rock like most of the steel bases . Both tools work smoothly and have plenty of power. I have many power tools and every time I purchase another brand,I end up returning it and getting makita , check them out for yourself , the quality is always there ."
4,good but beware!,"The incase leather sleeve is of durable solid quality, the stiching is nice and it has nice grips on the inside so the ipod doesnt slip out, plus it includes a clip. Beware however, because the title warns nothing about the color so i assumed it was black. Big mistake, it is actually baby blue. My sister was happy to take it for her ipod but now i have to order another black leather case"
1,Mitchum Clear Gel,"I rated this product as a 5 for it's quality in keeping me dry and odor free, but there are two inaccurate pieces of information on the back of the bottle. It indicates that it is quick drying but it takes at least 3-4 minutes to dry. It also states that it is a ""no residue formula"" but it leaves a tremendous amount of white residue on all of my blouses. Did I get a bad bottle?? I doubt that this will be posted for review, but it would be nice if someone from the Revlon Company could tell me if this is a common complaint with the clear gel formula. Thank you."
2,Not enough information,"I was expecting this book to come with a CD (it's called ""A Barefoot Singalong) but there wasn't enough information to make sure it was included. Sure enough, when it came there wasn't a CD..."
4,Brilliant!,"This book is an absolute brilliant masterpiece of the imagination! Was a little difficult for me to read through at a constant pace, but I loved every minute of it!"
5,Perfect,"For anyone who needs this style of bit and uses a 1/4 inch quick connect drill, this is a must have. This is my third one over the course of many years and the only complaint I would have with this item is that they tend to grow legs. But seriously, I believe these can be re-sharpened and should last you a long time granted you take care of it and can manage to keep it away from your sly handed co-workers. Also, do not let the image fool you, this is not a narrow drill bit head as it shows, I ordered it questioning if I would get what was in the picture or what was described in the word description, and it is described correctly."
4,everyone should read this,This is a very well wriiten psychology book. It will help you to understand yourself better. I wish the publisher will do the reprint
4,I wish she'd done more.....,"What's obvious from the outset on this album was that Jessi Colter is a phenomenal talent. What's obvious from the cover is that she's also gorgeous. However, while I was listening to the disc, I kept thinking that her collaboration/marriage to Waylon Jennings may have actually hurt her career. I believe that if she'd had the marketing push and airplay, we might be talking about her in the same kinds of tones reserved for Tammy, Loretta and Dolly. Also if she'd had the ambition of those other ladies it might have been a different story as well. I'm not knocking contentment per se., but in the record business, contentment generally doesn't lend itself to creativity. I wish she'd made more music and hopefully she'll make more in the future."
5,very pleased,This CD contains songs by Jessi which I think are among her very best. My entire buying experience was a pleasure. Would recommend highly.
4,"An Outlaw . . . A Lady, the very best of Jessi Colter","Jessi's songs were part of my younger years. Her plaintive voice brings back an important transition time in my life. My wife and I slow dance in the kitchen to some of the tracks. However, for some technical reason, I don't think on my CD player, some of the later tracks at times do not play completely, and the machine stops. Possibly, a production fault. Yet, the music is great, from a golden era - half of my lifetime ago."
1,"The Best of Carson, Volume 1","I faithfully watched the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson over the 30 years that he was on TV and I was very disappointed in the material on this DVD set. This certainly is not the ""best of Carson"". I thought most of it was boring. Many of the guests were unknown and uninteresting. Johnny Carson and Ed McMahon did so many funny skits with Aunt Blabby and Carnac over the years, but the two on this set had to be the worst. I can't believe that with 30 years of material, this was the best they could come up with."
5,The Best of Johnny Carson,"If you are a fan of Johnny, this is a must...the bits with Dean Martin and George Gobel are priceless. There will never be new comedy to match these old days of television no matter how hard they try. Johnny Carson was the best too!!!"
2,Not enough,"This album hardly shows up what this gorgeous coloratura can do. It's slow, has a easy listening feel to it, but totally lacks a moment to remember."
1,Can't Get Any Replacement Parts!,"I have a different Fontaine faucet, actually, but we had a problem with water flow. I contacted a couple of plumbing places, and they didn't carry any Fontaine parts, so I contacted the company directly. We corresponded about the part, and then I heard nothing for a week, so I contacted them again. Customer service said they were sorry, but they'd forgotten to send it - they would send it immediately! Three weeks later, I still have no part and no working kitchen sink! Now they haven't responded to me contacting them. We loved the faucet, but it's not worth the money if I can't get any replacement parts! Save your money and go with another company!FYI: Their customer service number is 800-476-2950. Email address: CS@fontainefaucets.com - that's for customer service. Not that it'll do you any good..."
1,Don't Buy Fontaine,"I bought a Fontaine Marisol pull down faucet from Costco. They don't carry Fontaine anymore...Too many returned?The sprayer switch has become erratic and the rubber cover comes off. I tried to contact Fontaine but their number is disconnected and they don't reply to emails. From reading other reviews, parts are not available from plumbing supply stores.The handle started to come loose so I took it off and applied Locktite to the hidden screw and tightened it. That should have been done at the factory.This is a very very expensive faucet because it only lasts about a year and you can't get parts. Since I bought it from Costco I will return it and get my money back. I will replace it with a name brand company that stands behind their products."
3,Olympus 50-MM Zuiko Digital,"Overall a decent lens. Good detail and sharpness. A lens that attracts attention from others. But, all this comes with a price and not just in dollars.The lens is costly, in the area of $825 to $950. It is heavy and requires a tripod 95% of the time. Changing lens on any DSLR in the field is taking a slight risk due to the sensor and or mirror getting debris on them but this lens because of it's size and weight increases that risk it is not a fast snip snap to change.The lens covers from 100MM to 400MM (35MM equivalent) which is a great range.I would consider the Panasonic DMC-FZ50 camera in its place for four reasons. (1) The cost is less then $500. (2) It is much lighter and smaller. (3) the range is better 35MM to 420MM (35MM equivalent) (4) This cameras lens is as sharp or BETTER then the Zuiko.I returned this lens to Amazon for the above reasons."
2,atomic clock not working,Like the informations but the atomic clock only worked onceWhen I had to change the batteries it did not set itself at all.I had to do it manually!I do not recommand this item as I think the best feature was the atomic clock
1,Not a good buy,"I purchased several of these at Wal Mart - none of which ""worked"". The data transmission (if you can even call it that) is painfully slow. Frankly I'm suprised that this item has not already appeard on the shelves of close out stores for $9.99. Take it from somebody who knows, if you have $100 to spend on a weather station, don't do it with Acu-Rite, because you'll be very angry that you did."
2,Inaccurate,"I've had this unit for a couple of years now and it's got a lot of issues. The anemometer feature is totally inaccurate, I've never seen it read higher than 8 mph even when we're getting 40 mph wind gusts. The internal house temperature is consistently 3 degrees lower than the actual temperature in the house. The most irritating aspect is the lack of backlighting which makes it very difficult to read. The outside wind and temperature sensors randomly loose their signal for no apparent reason, even with brand new lithium batteries. I primarily bought the unit because it featured an anemometer, but the anemometer is useless and not even close to reality in its readings. I would not buy this unit again."
5,Hypnosis and Hypnotherapy has great practical use,I found that I can use this book for learning and reference
5,The Ideology of Rethoric,"The Rhetoric of Leviathan is a deep study about the systematic construction of Thomas Hobbes's political philosophy. The author leaves of an unusual analysis of the theory of history of young Hobbes and sustains, differently of classics like Leo Strauss, that effective rupture doesn't exist in uncoiling of the historical thought for the scientific-philosophical thought. Both base on the causal idea. Johnston notices Hobbes as the ideologist that indeed was. It demonstrates that the objective of its political theory was to do the common, ignorant and irrational man, to accept the idea of the state of nature, rational indicator of the need of an organized State. He sees the rhetoric of the political theory of Hobbes as a technique of cultural transformation that objectified to impede the sedition and the civil war in the England of seventy century. A fantastic and essential book."
2,Only for the most diehard fan of rare soul oldies.,"The songs by Bobby Wade, The Nu-Luvs, The Vegas, Lawrence and The Arabians and others are quite nice but all suffer from terrible remastering. The vinyl records used for transferring these songs onto CD were obviously in terrible shape and (as such) the music suffers. I recommend this only to the most diehard fans of rare and obscure soul oldies- all others are better off avoiding this horrible-sounding CD (although I admit I've yet to run across these songs on any other CD)."
5,Nice quality grinder,I have had the grinder for 2 months and it has worked flawlessly. The wheels can be changed in a snap using the spindle lock and tool provided. I like the carrying case as well. I would recommend it to anyone--novice or professional.
5,Go to Grinder,"I have two Bosch grinders. One with the slide switch, the other with a paddle switch. The slide switch is my go to grinder. The paddle type does not lock on very positively. AS for the the actual grinding: it works very well, even one handed. Very smooth and powerful. I use the Walter Zip blades mostly"
