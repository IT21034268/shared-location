3,It's okay but not the best bilingual book out there,This is a good book for families trying to teach their kids another language but for a native speaker like myself it just didn't work for me. The illustrations are mediocre and I would've like to see other types of food (more fruits or veggies).
1,Bilingual educator/parent/abuela,"My Food/Mi Comida: This board book offers poor translation and does not include food items that are a natural part of Hispanic children's diet.I do not recommend this book for pre-schoolers, parents to read to children, or for pre-school teachers to use at pre-school."
3,At least it's something,"Well, my younger brother was unfortunate enough to get this, thinking it was from the original japanese series (though we recently DID get our hands on the original..), but we managed to partially enjoy it. It's better than waiting around a year to get the actual uncut version of this thing out, right? ..anyway, my brother and I were disappointed with the outcome like the D-E-A-T-H turning into F-I-N-A-L and everything, but we both agree that it's a lot better just to either download the japanese episodes or wait for them to come out as uncut DVDs. Of course, I'm not the patient type, so I sometimes buy these dub DVDs anyway.. hehe.."
4,Begining of Battle City Finals!,"This dvd and the vhs is great. Episodes on it are..80.Lights, Camera, Duel-Mai must duel and defeat Jean-Claude Magnum if she doesn't want to have to marry him!81.Let the Finals Begin!-All the finalests of Battle City gather for the finals and there may be more to the finals then Yugi and his friends bargained for!82.The Dark Spirit Revealed (Part 1)-Yugi is matched up againest Bakura in the first match of the Battle City Finals! But when Bakura goes evil again, can Yugi match up againest the Dark Sanctuary card?83.The Dark Spirit Revealed (Part 2)-Yugi's duel with Bakura continues! Bakura has two more cards up his sleeve, Destiny Board and Dark Necrofear! Can Yugi draw Slifer before it's too late?84.The Dark Spirit Revealed (Part 3)-Yugi finally draws Slifer the Sky Dragon but Yugi has a chose, Forfeit the duel or lose his friend?"
1,So very Pathetic!,"You people writing reviews about how good it is and saying ""opps spoiler"" Its so lame! I mean for God's sake you could see it on Kids WB and Cartoon Network every fricken day! I saw the Bakura Vs. Yugi episodes like 5 times each! Its so obvious who wins. And people giving it 5 stars. Your wasting your money on crap! You could get the uncut ones for cheaper or do you have a problem with the japanese voice actors. I mean they cut out half the good stuff in the crappy garbage your wasting your money on! For example in the Japanese one they show Bakura shoving a big wad of beef down his fricken throat. Thay also say that Dark Nacrafia is called ""Dark Necrofear"" [...] They don't even say damn,hell,or [...]. I'm helping you people who are buying this [...]. Kids WB is [...]! They ruin everything they get there frickin hands on. Well anyway STOP BUYING this crap.(I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST YU-GI-OH)"
5,Fits GSG 522 and Works Well,"Super easy installation. I just removed the crappy picatinny rail that the gun comes with, took the claws off, slid it on and reattached them. Then it lined up with the iron sights very easily with the two adjustment knobs, which are very precise. The brightness settings work well and the dot is highly visible in any light. I don't worry about it losing zero at all since it mounts very firmly and it's only at 22lr. It's also easy to see through if you just want to use the irons. At this price, I couldn't be happier with it."
3,You get what you pay for,This was a very inexpensive sight for my MP5 22 LR. It is very simple to install. Honestly I didn't even use this sight much because I moved on to a better one. But if you're looking for something inexpensive and for a small caliber then it could be good enough.
5,Claw Mount,"Cann't say enough about this optic. It fits and hold great and dot is very bright, I would recommend this scope."
2,"Looks nice, does not fit gsg-522 at all",Received this and it looks nice. Does not fit my GSG-522 at all. My gun has several metal parts on top of the barrel that are under the Picatinny mount that interfere with the mounting. You have to take the Picatinny rail off to mount this. Make sure your gun does not have these before ordering.
2,Bad design,"The positive - the sight is very well made and finished. The optics were clear and the red dot crisp and bright (when turned up) and always visible without ""multiple stars"" for the red dot.The negative - the design of the sight places it at the exact height of the front and rear sights on my Echo-1 airsoft MP5. While the rear sight is removable, the front sight isnt. The optics feild of view is quite narrow and this coupled with the front sight makes it difficut to use. NSTAR should increase the height of the optics off of its integral base by half an inch or so, then this sight would be perfect."
2,don't waste your money,"I thought this was a good deal until I hit the range, and found out the adjustment knobs were backwards, up was down, left was right. I got it zeroed, and fired again, and the poi moved drastically. Probably good for airsoft, but lousy for recoil"
3,Kind of fits HK mp5 22lr/ weak screws/ blurry red dot,"This sight just barely fits the HK mp5 22lr. it took a lot of tinkering to get it on correctly and it was still slanted a little to the right in the end. The allen screws that came with to tighten on the claw clamps broke immediately i was very disappointed, but new screws are cheap. the red dot when at full brightness seems to be blurry unless you are looking at a target at around 50 yards or more not ideal for a 1X20. but on the positive side it stays accurate. easy adjustment. very precise adjustment. also came with extra battery and allen wrench. you get what you pay for so if you have a little extra money go with something else. but if you are broke like me i this isnt a bad item other than the screws and the slight blurriness."
3,Review,"This is a well-written book, that is concise. It is recommended for somebody who wants to capture the major issues quickly (there is no major pages of text that the reader has to sift through to get to the goodies). Even though it is concise it has advanced material (some not available in any other adaptive filtering book)."
4,Deserves More Time And A Larger Screen,"Originally an IMAX film, a lot of the impressive cinematography is lost on the small screen, but that doesn't mean the impact is affected. Robert Redford narrates this amazing beautifully filmed documentary on some of the world's most fantastic places and creatures. Scenes of thermal waterfalls from Thailand edit to massive glacial mouths, air-spouting whales in Alaska, flying monkeys in Asia, exotic undersea life, razor tipped snow capped peaks and more. The sound is spectacular especially in 5.1 DTS with nature sounds mixed with subtle native percussion. Although it only lasts forty minutes and the screen is smaller, the special effects of accelerated photography matched against normal paced scenes makes for an experience far too short for its greatness. One could watch this repeatedly."
4,More than good enough,"I agree with previous reviewer regarding that the scenes could last longer, but nowhere is a 15 seconds fading in-out (and, in any case, it's not a blank screen); it also may seem artificial in some parts, and new-age style in others... BUT... there are many images that I've never seen in my life on any documentary (in an incredible quality). If anybody gets bored with this (only 45 mins. in any case), well, you may not be suited for documentaries. The buddhas statues in Thailand, the monkeys in Borneo, the amazing trees in many places, the canyons, the crystal-ice... There's much more to be thankful for than to be angry with. As I said in the beginning, it should have been better if the scenes lasted longer, but that does not prevent me to give this four stars.(Excuse my poor english, not my native tongue.)"
2,Pretty but completely humanistic,"The message of this film is that tribal cultures are spiritually superior to 'civilized' humans. Hmmm. I guess cannibalism, ritualistic sacrifice, animism, warfare, and fear of unreasonable and temperamental gods appeals to some. Outward appearances may look nice, but dig a little deeper. Beautiful shots of nature."
2,Not terrible but...,"When you rent this movie...please know that it is basically a National Geographic on DVD. Great filmography on the director/ producers parts. Beautiful scenes...lacking is the overall package, in some regards it is very interesting, and in others, it is a great bore!!! ZZZZ My son, who loves animals, basically of any kind...fell asleep while watching this film, and he is 9!! He, to say the least, did not seem impressed by this Disney effort...as I understand, this was a previous IMAX theater selection, I gather that it was shown to tourists at theme parks, such as DISNEY, if this were the case...maybe it should have stayed there!!"
4,Nice Mug for your favorite cold beverage,"I bought this mug because the pewter mugs I had are rather small. This is a pewter like material, but it is not pewter as one reviewer said. It is an aluminum alloy that feels and acts like pewter. My main concern was whether the mug would hold a lot of liquid. The mug looks small at first, but hold 14 ounces (I measured). I threw it in the freezer and 30 mins later, I had an ultra cold mug. When I put soda or beer in it the foam would actually freeze to the side of the mug. Alot of pewter type mugs are thin so they get cold fast but warm up fast too. This is not the case with this mug. It is thick so it stays cold for a while."
4,Solid mug - but smaller than expected,"The mug is very rugged and solid. From the picture and the box it comes in I expected it to be a bit larger, but I suppose it still holds 12 ounces. I put it in the freezer for a few minutes for the first use and found that it gets cold very fast. The bottom is not perfectly flat as another reviewer mentioned, but it's not a problem. There is a bit of a metallic taste, but I guess that would be expected.Overall, it's a good mug... great for Hobbits, but most of the Dwarves I know prefer something larger."
4,Neet little companion,"Ok, so this little pamphlet probably gets laughs from administrators who see it on poor user's desks but I have to admit I don't use UNIX 24-7 and I forget commands every now and then. This is a good resourse to have around when you need to dive into the command line and you can't remember what the command was to calculate pi to the nearest whole number. Hats off to O'Reilly again."
4,Good introduction,"This is a good first book on Unix. A reader of the book can decide which of the subjects covered in the book interests him, and go deeper by reading other books. Be sure to check the errata page at oreilly.com for mistakes in the book."
4,Good stuff to start with,This book is a great book to start-up on your Unix commands. The examples re-iterate their meaning and I think this book is a great start to the world of Unix.The X Win discussion though I thought could have been at the end of the book instead of the beginning.
3,"Not a necessity, but it's a good book.","This is a good book for figuring out Unix a little better, but honestly if you're computer savvy at all, you can figure out how to work in Unix on your own just fine anyway, so I wouldn't necessarily call it a need. If this is on the recommended textbooks for like a programming class or something, then don't bother if it's worth saving the extra cash. I passed my programming class with an A without it just fine working in Unix and I barely even read it."
3,You can do better,"I don't have a problem with ""basic"", but at one hundred pages, this book is too short a read; surely, one can find something similarly beginner-friendly and inexpensive, but more substantial. (""UNIX for Dummies"" is a plausible candidate). A perfectly decent book if viewed in isolation, but questionable value-for-money when compared to alternatives."
5,very insightful UNIX introduction,"Well, once I have started with this book and it had been helpful and well guiding book. In is not the ""only"" book you will need. I have followed someone review's advice and paired this book with a ""UNIX Essentials"" DVD and they made a very effective couple.One way or another those people who pick book of this sort usually had no opportunity to attend some UNIX classes and the DVD alleviates this problem. May be it's just me,but when I pick a book and go through it I'm still no really confident. It does not matter how book is good, I'm never sure is it enough to make a claim that ""I know UNIX"". And this book along with the DVD had solved this issue to me. Book is easy to read and pleasure to follow. The examples and the explanations are very clear. So I liked this book very much."
4,Learnin Unix Op Sys,Excellent program - I just decided that I would not be able to use Linux while in school
1,This book is a waste of money,"This book covers many areas but only breifly at best. I do not recommend this book. I strongly suggest you look at other books. I found this book very frustrating and at times threw the book across the room in anger. I'm not sure who the intended audience was supposed to be, perhaps elementary students writing a book report on the Unix OS, even then it provides very little information."
1,I wouldn't if I were you,"This was an optional text for an Intro Unix/Linux course. I am so glad the required book is a lot better than this one. Some of the code samples are in the paragraphs and it is hard to tell what is text and what is a unix command. If I only had this text, I doubt I could get through the class. It provides no new information."
3,intro to operating system,I need the definition of Operating system and file system. I need to review the different operating system. Genarally the introduction to operating system.
4,Basic intro to the use of unix/linux,"This book was written for the newbie who is using a unix terminal. He don't teach you the installation or config of unix, only gives you an overview of the fundamental commands and tasks (logging, windowing, managing files & directories, background processing and a little more). So if you are using a unix/linux preconfigured system and know nothing about unix, then buy this book or look the net (for there are very much like this and you don't need to pay), if not, forget!!!"
2,Big disappointment,"I'm a big fan of O'Reilly, but this book doesn't cut it. If you're completely new to computers and new to UNIX, this book is probably a good one, but if you are remotely familiar with another O/S, skip this book. It is way too basic and only covers a handful of commands. ""UNIX for dummies"" is less condescending and covers more. For instance, the printing section says what to do if ""my printout hasn't come out"". It says ""other users may have made a request to the printer ahead of you and your file should be printed in turn."" Then ""...check the printers connections and power switch"" Duh. O'Reilly usually writes books for smart people, this is an exception."
2,Not feeling this album...............,"Although fairly new to Grime, I do know what good music is and this isn't a good effort. I am a fan of Wiley, Kano and old crew member Dizze Rascal, but I can't figure out where the crew tried to go with this album. The R&B type samples used are wack and the production on most others tracks is just ok. Nevertheless, if Roll Deep makes it out to the Bay Area, I'm going to the show. Wiley and Kano, I know you guys are tighter than that!!!!!!"
3,Historical liberties in service of a good story.,"This novel is a fictionalized account of the life of Dragging Canoe, an 18th century Cherokee war chief. While the basic facts, events and battles are fairly well in order, there are some glaring errors. This author seems to fail to understand what matriarchy means. He references a male character longing for a son as his heir. In Cherokee culture of the time, the man's political heir would have been his sister's oldest son. As a historian whose works have been published by the Cherokee nation one would expect better. This novel's point of view give credence to some critics who have labeled Conley as a propagandist for a particular status quo within the Cherokee nation's history. In the words of the late Wilma Mankiller, the history of the Cherokee in the past 400 years is the history of the struggle against patriarchial colonialism. Based upon this work, Conley fails to grasp this concept."
3,Good Appendice,"This book is good when you're already prepared for the TOEFL iBT and you need a material to final review. For this purpose, it's really great."
4,Need For Speed?,why would any body wanna buy an action filled racing game that allows you to build up your car. Because of the fact that it is fun? Well here is my oppinion ill give it a 4 because it has great graphics and is fun but Ill take away one of the five because it wasn't as good as the comercials make it out to be.Jebus_crest
4,SWEEET GAME!,"THIS GAMES AWESOME. THE GRAPHICS AND LIGHTING ARE TRICKED OUT WITH 20 CARS TO CHOOSE FROM LIKE THE NEON, SKYLINE, RX-7,FOCUS, S2000, CELICA, SUPRA, TIBURON, CIVIC, MIATA, 350Z,Golf, IMPREZA, PEUGOT,AND ECLIPSE.

4,cool game,cool game!I like this game because when you play this game it feels like your your actually are in the game.
4,awesome,This game is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Best racing game of all time.Challenging but fun.Sick cars.You will not want to stop playing this game.
1,This game is driving me crazy!,"This game is driving me crazy! My name is Dominic James DeVetis and I am 7 years old. This game is hard and your car get's out of control sometimes. When you just started, there are dumb cars. The cars are slow. This game is the 3rd worst Gamecube game in my house. My big brother says not!"
5,best GC racing game,I found this game very fun. The graphics are good and the car modification options are endless. though i do wish that there was a bigger selection of cars.
2,Misleading description,"The Avery review states that this kit includes the ""Avery(R) CD/DVD label applicator"". It does not. It also states that it contains ""jewel case insert labels"". It does not. It has 50 CD labels & 100 jewel case spine labels only. Either they sent me the wrong item or the Avery review is from another item."
1,Didn't get product as advertised,"The item arrived in due time, but it was for just the labels and spines. There were no jewel case inserts and no software. Very disappointed that the vendor hasn't corrected this issue by now."
1,Not what advertised.,This item says software is included but it is not. I purchased this item to print the cover for a jewel case and what I got was labels for the cd and case with no sofware. Worth absolutely nothing without the software. Someone at Amazon.com needs to get this straightened out. NO STAR!
4,Pediatrics (NMSIS),"The format is helpful. It contains pertinent information, that is well orgainized. The questions and answers with explanations puts you in the test taking mode and gives detailed content for the answers. This edition sorely needs to be updated. 2000 edition. Additional sources should be used to prepare for an exam. Do not rely on this source alone."
4,i missed her,"i truly enjoyed her spin on other artists songs, it was a much too long an absence from recording. i enjoyed it, as would any true diana ross fan."
5,Diana Ross Worldwide Idol streams the beauty of music!!!!!!,"""I LOVE YOU"" DIANA ROSS' new cd is pure joy. Her voice is lovely and the songs are well chosen. The title cut is a gem, ""I LOVE YOU"", the best vocal performance of this distinctive, and romantic cd. All selections from this fine, classy, and heartfelt singer are pure delights. Her version of ""I WILL"" is a platinum gem. I hope you treat yourselves to this enchanting, and divine cd.Bravo to all the musicians on this cd, and cheers for the great song selections.I hope Diana Ross wins a well deserved grammy award for these brave performances, best vocal, female performance."
5,"Diana Ross Sings to Love: NEW: ""I LOVE YOU"" CD","This CD is awesome.Very well produced and with many fine musicians.The best cut, the cover version of the Beatles' ""I will"". Great singers sing the standards.Diana Ross, proves by this record, that her voice is a grace, to love.Each day this CD is a joy to my ears. What a fine vocal artist.!!!!!!Highly enjoyable CD, every day of the year!!!!!"
5,Still At Her Best,"This CD is excellent! The great selection of songs and that voice! Timeless! I am thoroughly enjoying this CD and recommend it for those who enjoy easy listening as well as the beautiful, talented Diana Ross. After all these years, she is ""still at her absolute best""!"
4,wow the hatred,"man, the new release of diana's album just seems to have been a reason to hate her and bash her! See other messgae boards and youtube and you'll see what i mean. I am so upset at this hatred and venom that you guys in the US have given to diana......not all on here have been that bad thankfully.My review is,,,,,,,these songs are sung in the romantic, breathy way that they should be....and i think she has done a good job with many of the tracks, including only you and always and forever.diana has not tried to 'disco'them....thank goodness. it's an album of love songs plain and true.i love it and i love you diana. keep ém coming please."
4,The Boss is back,"I have noticed alot of negative reviews on this cd since it's release. I am not sure what people were expecting from Diana. This album is exactly what it is packaged as. A love letter..... It is not an upbeat,pop,r&b,disco confection. Instead you get a very laid back, insightful, sweet, relaxing, sexy,romantic album of songs. I think Dianas fans wanted her to return with a monster pop/r&B album. Well, this isn't it. Instead you get a very nice cover album by one of the most incredible ladies in the music industry. Cheers to Diana for creating yet another great listen...... Keep it up....."
1,It's Over -,"One of the posters on here claimed that this CD was as good as ""Force Behind The Power"" - and nothing could be further from the truth. Diana's voice as we once knew it, is gone. She sings mainly from her lower register now, and all of the power in her voice has disappeared. She needs to give up her pride and get serious with a vocal coach, or just give it up altogether. The batch of songs on here don't make any kind of impression, with the exception of Marvin Gaye's ""I Want You"" - the only track that evokes the seductive spirit that Ross is known for. I don't know how this project was put together, but I doubt Ross ever spent time in the studio with the musicians who play on the tracks. A couple of the songs sound like they were recorded in the wrong key. The only way this work will sell, will be if she pulls off a remarkable performance of one of the songs on one of her many personal appearances next week in TV Land. I doubt the CD will even break into the 200 Album Chart. Sorry D."
1,i love you by Diana ross,"never one of my favorite female singers, however in this time of everyone coming out of the closet doing standards I thought this would be more enjoyable. I even bought one for my daughter. Do not like, never will play."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED!!,"There was a time when I supported & defended Diana Ross no matter what she did. I even rode with her through the RCA years. I have purchased every CD/album she has ever done and I must say I am now to the point of finally giving up. Miss Ross obviously expects us to lower our standards and expectations of what a singer should be, which I refuse to do since I know the talent is there somewhere. She has drifted to the point of being in the no talent M Carey club and expects this to be enough. Who would have thought after waiting all this time she would give us something like this. All of the little pop favorites just don't seem to do it. What a terrible selection of songs, especially ""Crazy Little Thing Called Love"" which I think they may have forgotten to put on her ""Eaten Alive"" album.Well, maybe in another 7 years."
3,Still just an effort.,"I previously reviewed the European release of Diana Ross' ""I Love You"".The import edition has a 10 minute DVD packaged with it. The US distributor of this CD should have considered including the DVD as well.With all the buzz surrounding ""Dreamgirls"", Ross must have been advised to delay US release of this CD. Is it selling? It is even charting? I will get back to you."
1,wow this is bad,"The fact that this has had no US release was an immediate warning .... however as a longtime fan I figured I would check it out. Boy is this bad. There are a few decent tracks, however the truly awful ""Crazy Little Thing Called Love"", ""This Magic Moment"", ""Only You"" - among many others - make this unlistenable. Miss Ross is a great singer and interpeter - check out the delicacy she approached the Billie Holliday material. She is a producer's singer: Ashford and Simpson, CHIC, Holland Dozier Holland - even Hall & Oates - all were able to take her talent and create - in some cases - true all time classics. This is a mess. Diana, your voice still sounds great - STOP executive producing your projects!"
5,I Love You,"Very nice, signature Diana Ross music. Her sounds has remained distinct and resistant to the cookie-cut styles that have emerged over the last several decades. You'll certainly appreciate this even more once you see her interview with James Lipton (Inside the Actors Studio). Enjoy!"
5,Still The Best Singer I have Ever Heard!,"This album Diana Ross sings lower which is when she sounds best! I like ""Crazy Little Thing Called Love"" and ""Remember"""
3,i love diana,how lovely to hear something new from diana good album of covers if not alittle strange choice ie crazy little thing called love didnt get that one at all stick to what your so fab at doing the love songs the rest of the album is great
4,Ms. Ross does it again,"Just downloaded this cd and I have to admit I really do like this cd. When I first heard it for the first time I said ok it sounds ok. But after listening to it over and over a great deal of these songs really takes a whole of you. I Want You,Lovely Day,More Than Yesterday and I Love You(All That Really Matters) are truly my favorites, although The Look of Love grabs my attention as well. Overall the diva is back and Ms. Ross is not playing around this time."
1,Shameful -- Stross is a shill,"With the economic success in the Valley, now everybody wants a piece of the action, including journalists. Sadly, this book will probably follow on Po Bronson's and Jerry Kaplan's as a script for a Hollywood movie.I bought this book because, one, I've been operating as an entrepreneur in Silicon Valley for some time, and, two, I enjoyed Randall Stross's book on Steve Jobs and Next. That book, ""The Next Big Thing"", exhibited balanced, accurate journalism.Stross has lost my respect with Eboys, however. Sorry, but VC firms don't operate in this compassionate, humane way, and Benchmark is no exception. The book's message that these guys are motivated by service to the entrepreneur is laughable. The venture business is all about return on investment, and these guys are among the most tough-minded and ruthless in the Valley. To not recognize that most fundamental reality, Stross has either lost his mind or sold out."
4,A quick light read,"You'll want to read it in a day given the stabilization that has taken place in the ""new economy"": Contains some interesting examples of the different business dynamics in silicon valley. Paints a picture of VC guys being respectable during a time when the industry perceived them as vultures."
3,Interesting but light,"This book is a 'fly-on-the-wall' account of a specific example of the short-lived Silicon Valley bubble. It makes interesting bedtime reading, but is short on lessons for those trying to put together a startup. A better starting point would be John L Nesheim's ""High Tech Start Up"" - its the Valley's bible."
4,"exciting. interesting, inspiring.","it is rare to find a book that provides an insider's look in the venture capital business... eboys does it wonderfully!the true stories will take you from the exciting board meetings, to the completion of THE DEAL!to help truly understand the inflation/deflation of .com businesses, and what drove them to succcess, read this book...enjoy!"
4,What professional venture capitalists do,There is a common misconception that venture capitalists are just the lucky guys who get in on winners before the IPO. Stross does a fine job of portraying Benchmark as the value-added 'company builders' they are and not mere passive investors. He gives a 'fly-on-the-wall' account of the Benchmark venture process and lucid examples of the hands-on dedication they provide to each of their portfolio companies. A must read for entreprenuers in the venture process to understand the benchmark they should measure their investors against.
3,Venture Capital Hardy Boys,"A reporter is allowed behind the curtain to see how powerful VC make their billons. In this particular instance, the VC firm happens to be one of the most prominent leaders in e commerce investment.I learned a lot about how VC operate. There is some drama and a few colorful characters emerge from this well-written book.I wish the author had put even a little critical distance between himself and his subject. The book has a kind of ""gee wiz"" flavor to it. The subject matter is a bunch a 30 somethings making ungodly amounts of money taking ownership positions in start up companies. Yet, our author witnessed not one example of greed or shading the truth. I bet these VC really aren't the Hardy Boys of Silcon Valley."
1,"Danger, Will Robinson......",".......if you are an entrepreneur and think that a kinder, gentler breed of venture capitalist exists as described in this book. Make no mistake: when you get funded by a venture capital firm you start a dance with the devil, and the minute that you start running out of cash you will be well aware of your partner's horns and tail. Benchmark is among the best of the bunch, but c'mon! a rapid return on investment is what drives them, not some implied gentleman's code.This is a pretty story, well-written, but one that does nothing to capture the underlying dynamics of venture capital today. Venture capitalist as hand maiden to the entrepreneur: snort!"
4,Some good tips for Entrepreneurs and new VCs or Angels,"If your looking to become involved in Venture Capital or Angel investing this is a good starter. It offers helpful insight into the process but is light on technical details such as the structure of a fund. And if your an entrepreneur looking for capital it offers useful insight from the VCs perspective regarding what they look for, what they like and don't like, etc.Not a how to book for either group of readers but it provides useful color and flavoring for the process."
4,Highly motivating,"As someone between semesters in a top MBA program, spending my summer in a VC, I was completely captivated by this story from beginning to end. A story such as this makes me wish I had taken a different path directly after undergrad and gone straight to Silicon Valley rather than laboring for years in a ""resume builder"".Fortunately for Mr. Stross, he happened to be at the right firm at the right time. No one could have possibly imagined the deals he was witness to.This true-to-life account is an accurate depiction of what really goes on at top VC's and is as informative as it is entertaining. For those who did not like the book, I would suggest they were perhaps in search of more technicals and have turned their backs on what amounts to a fine history lesson."
5,Great solution!,"Perfect fit, perfect function. My coupler had gotten out of adjustment (or never was in proper adjustment), and had worn in a few places. This took all of 10 minutes to replace the whole works and adjust it properly, and now it works great. Just be sure to install the flanged nut holder correctly."
2,doesn't repeat anything,"If you've done the pimsleur language program before, you'll realize how bad this one is. they say the words so fast and even if you slow it down on your player, it doesn't make any difference. the speakers say 2 different versions. I'm assuming it's for male and female speakers. Or does it depend on the gender of the person you're speaking to? hmmm. i dunno. but then again, i don't have the text for it, just the audio from the library.at least with pimsleur, they repeat the entire line, then the last syllable first going back to the first, and they emphasize the difficult parts.i'm listening to the audio only version from my public library and this is very discouraging. you'll give up after the first few minutes! to think this was made for beginners!definitely not recommended. i don't even like the ""free"" version of this."
4,Better than I expected,"I hate having to wipe the sweat from my hands when I am playing, so this controller was a godsend to me. Sure, the buttons aren't as responsive as the Sony controller and the L2 and R2 buttons feel very strange for a while, but the air flow works like a dream. Even given my concerns about the buttons, I use this in any case because it is just so much more comfortable to play with.I have been using the controller for about 7 months pretty much every day for a couple of hours or more. Recently the left stick seems to go dead sometimes and then it works after you reboot, so maybe longeivity is an issue. But the air flow works so well I am just going to buy another one.I know it sounds like a gimmick, but I have no complaints."
2,I am 13 yrs old. I live in NY. I bought Airflo EX...........,I bought AirFlo ex from circuit city. One of the analog sticks are not working properly. This controller is not a good buy.
2,Great Idea...Not so great product,"Basically, this product is not built to last. I liked everything about this controller, except the fact that it is 6 months later and it doesn't work anymore. The left analog stick randomly sends signals to go to the right. So when I am trying to race in Need For Speed, I randomly get sent into the wall. :( The airflow idea works really well, it keeps your hands dry...but 6 months is not an acceptable lifetime for a controller. I will not buy this product again, maybe the next version if they come out with one."
5,Great Product,"Great product,especially with all the extras I got for such a low price. Excellent and fast shipping. Thanks so much!"
1,Not worth the money,I bought and Italian Villa pizza stone and it cracked the first time I used it. I did have it in the oven at 550 degrees for about 2 hours but it should be able to withstand any heat.
3,Not For Everyone,"Personally, I found the jokes hit their mark and the ending elicited enough tears for me to call the movie an over all sucess. However, I understand that some people found the movie heavy handed, bias, and cliche. I empathize with them, but even agree to some point. It's very easy to be offended. I think people just need to approach the movie expecting to be entertained. If you don't let go of the chip on your shoulder and expect everything to be 100% factual pertaining to the Catholic Church, I think you're going to be in for disappointment. Just chill out and enjoy."
1,"Superb play, but a HORRIBLE, truly painful movie","When I saw this play in NY in the 80s I had to sit in the aisle because I was laughing so hard. I originally thought my reaction was a function of a catholic school education, that was until a Jewish friend joined me in the aisle. Nancy Marchand as Sister Mary was perfection.This TV movie is the worst adaption of a play ever. Diane Keaton, who I generally love, is horribly miscast. She doesn't ""get it"", nor apparently did the director.A friend who had also seen the play in NY and I bought the DVD to show two other friends. We wanted them to experience the fun of Sister Mary. After 20 minutes we all agreed it was terrible and life was too short to waste another hour seeing it through to the end.So, so, so very bad!!!!!!!!"
1,look elsewhere,information that really can be found readily online. has elements of obvious pure marketing.
2,considering lipo,I bought this book expecting to become even more informed as it was written by a doctor but after reading it in only a couple of hours as it is a thin book i knew more from reading info online than what was written in the book. So overall not worth buying if you have access to the internet but good for someone with no other way to get the information.
3,Sprayer Chapin,Got this sprayer as an upgrade to the ones offered at the local home centers. I have been using this for a couple of months. Tank and pump handle is heavy duty but as for the handle sprayer and hose - just average. Would consider other brands or models. I would say at the price not a bargain.
2,Good book,I think it will be a awesome book to be my sources for my national history day project for school.
3,Interesting,"Interesting, but not as compelling as the full biography. Always nice to connect with a great person who has accomplished more than most."
4,Get it at iTunes,"So glad to see this available, but get it remastered at iTunes. Maybe WB will get the hint and rerelease the CD!"
3,"Wish they'd done more instrumental pieces, but overall, a good buy","I was so surprised that this soundtrack had never been released on DVD, but I'm glad it finally was. The title theme is very good. Wish they hadn't used the vocal tracks for some of the songs, but it's interesting to know the words to some of the tunes. I think it's worth it, but not as good as I was expecting all in all"
4,A very late review,"Well, I'd searched for this title quiete a long time. Thanks Amazon, now I found it.All in all a nicely written book. Though some minor things like the repetetive use of situations and the need to explain everything. Also a nicely done cover and some fine illustrations.Mr. Lane is quiete good at setting of the stage and bring over the emotions of his characters. In this he has a very fine hand.To make it short, it's a book I'ld buy again."
3,Not what I expected,"The bracelet was not what I expected from the picture shown. It was made well, but was not bright silver, but looked more like stainless steel. I returned the item."
1,unhappy customer,"quality of this product is horrible, its was breaking apart in less than a week. the materials used to make this product were very cheap!!"
5,Love this,"I like simple silver when i where jewelry.Quality is good,it's one size fits all. This is the perfect accent for casual or dressy attire"
3,Silver Mesh Bracelet,The bracelet is comfortable and good for everyday. The only problem is the bracelet I received looked used and was dull and had scratches on it. I thought I was purchasing a new product -- for the price I paid.
5,bracelet,it was a gift for my Daughter and she sure love's it. I would recommend it to anyone. Very elegant.
2,Way too small and thin,bracelet is too small and too thin. Does not look like a high quality piece of silver. Don't waste your money.
4,Simple yet elegant,"I bought this for everyday wear. It is a simple style that will go with everything. It is sturdy and the clasp has a good grip. I found that when I put on a long-sleeve jacket, it gets caught in the material. Just be cautious when wearing a knitted garment so not to pull threads."
1,"Sandra's View "" hated it""","The bracelet arrived in a timely manner. The silver looks very cheap and the bracelet is very, very thin, which I hated. I wore it a few times and put it away. I will not be wearing it again:("
3,I'd buy it again,"I was satisfied with the quality of this bracelet...it looked more expensive than it was and I love how it looks on my wrist. It was way too big for me though; if it were a few inches shorter it would have been perfect. I took it to a jewelery store to see if it could be sized, and they said that they would have to sauder it which would ruin the finish and expose the silver and it would tarnish easier. The guy at the store advised me that sizing it would not be the best idea. So, it's a great bracelet, I just wish it was 6 1/2 inches instead of 7 1/2."
1,What?,"Shittttay, not even close to good craftsmanship, made in Italy my butt. Came with a tag that says Honduras. Waste of money."
4,sterling silver bracelet,This bracelet could have been made narrower and thicker. Good value though. Especially for young person. Your word requirement for these reviews is very annoying!
2,smaller than expected,thought it wuold be a little more glamorous and wider. Not as big as I hoped. Heading out to get a small gift to compliment it as its not enough for XMAS alone.
3,Too little,Too thin I've bought better quality for the same price. Although it is pretty it is for small wrists and feels too delicate.
2,Meh,"I think I have pretty big biceps for a female...and I couldn't even fit into this! Unless you're a man with fairly sized arms, don't buy it. And the plastic cover doesn't seem very durable."
4,Great Watch But,I have had this watch for a couple of years and just now it is becoming unreliable. The battery is down to low and the watch will not function even though I have tried charging this solar watch. I have contacted Casio about the problem and am waiting. Before you buy this watch do a seach on Google and and type in GW300 problems and you will see hundreds of people who have had battery problems. Otherwise this has always beenMY FAVORITE WATCH !!! I never took it off til just recently. Thankfully I have many other Casio and other watches as back up !!!
2,Doesn't Receive WWVD,"Doesn't receive WWVD - and I'm less than 700 miles from Fort Collins, CO. Replaced under warranty; replacement doesn't work either. Receiver seems to not be sensitive enough."
2,Good but Pricey Disposable Watch,"I've had my casio for over a year now and it's been a great watch until the battery died. I thought it would be a simple battery replacement but apparently every store I went to said that this battery replacement would cost up to $65. Apparently what the salesman failed to mention when I purchased this watch is that a regular battery would not work and I had to purchase a rechargable battery. At $65, I might as well buy a new watch and it won't be another Casio. Solar watch... yeah right."
2,Solar charge not that great,"I have had a G-shock before and love the watches. Cool looks and solid. The problem with this one is that the Solar charge system does not keep up with normal use. The battery slowly dies and you will reach a point in a year or so where the charging will not support the use...In other words. Solar is nice, but if it can support the use or if you can't replace the battery and have to rely on it not. Mine is always empty after a day and the backlight does not come on anymore either.I am going to toss it out and get another watch...."
2,Waveceptor Doesn't Work,Lacks sensitivity to receive WWV signal every nite. Receives signal once about once a week on average. Returned three times under warranty. Casio replaced watch. Replacement doesn't work either despite Phoenix being only 800 miles from Ft. Collins CO. Other atomic clocks in the house work just fine. Evidently watch won't work in some locations.
5,Well-built,"The picture doesn't do it justice at all. It's as robust and well-built as the first true G-Shock watch that Casio has ever made. And it's even better. The resin-plastic watch band material should outlast the previous ones. With the addition of several useful features that I'm sure you're already aware of, the one that stands out is the solar cell recharging capability. I mean, how many years will this watch last? It'll all depend on the storage battery. I'm going to keep track. Maybe it'll outlive me."
1,"Don't buy this watch, not worth the money","I've had the watch for 4 years and spend a lot of time outdoors. Don't be fooled by the solar charging claim. Near the end of the four years, I had to start recharging the watch with a light. The battery slowly loses it's charge and then it has to be replaced at a cost of $65--it's not a normal battery and lasts less than a regular battery. It's a ripoff, stay clear."
2,Tough and Accurate for a Few Years,"I give this item two stars based on the battery performance. Recharging the solar battery only works less than a month after two years of use. That said, I'm giving solar one more shot with a new AWG101-1A. If I get the same results I'll quit buying Casios."
2,"G-Shock, Think Not","I've had this watch for several years. Time is perfect, construction is poor. Last year two of the function buttons on the watch fell off and I had to send it to an authorized repair station. $29.00 dollars later it was back with all the buttons. Now three of the four buttons fell off. Definitely poor construction. My son bought me a replacement Casio, and within 6 months a button has gone missing. Very poor quality!"
2,Problems and support,I have had this watch for almost a year. I love the watch but cannot give a good review because it has become unusable due to the battery only lasting an hour after sitting in direct sunlight for a full day. I have requested support from Casio and have not heard anything from them. If you buy a new watch every year this would be a good purchase.
2,Meh,"I received this poster today. It looks like it was printed out on someones home pc. Very poor quality image, ink looks washed out. I am glad I only paid $10.00."
1,fitting issues,"Got this for my 07 civic,had to remove the ice guards (held by 2 little torx screws on each blade), otherwise interfere with the wiper arms. Also, the arms' ends had to be slightly bent toward the windshield so the blades follow the curvature and hug the windshield instead of sticking flat. After all done works good but I wouldn't had bought these wipers if I knew that I must remove the ice shields."
3,CAUTION,"This is an excellent wiper blade. However, in order for it to be universal for all wiper arms, it comes with many separate plastic parts. With no specific instructions for which part go with which wiper arm, it is possible to install the wrong one. The result could mean the wiper blade will fall off in use. Mine did and I was lucky my windshield did not get scratched."
5,Wipers work perfect,Put these on my corvette for a trip across the country. After 6000 miles in every kind of weather they worked well. From heavy rain to light mists to heavy bug attacks they did their job quietly and efficiantly. Well worth the price.
4,Super Sporza,"I like the quietness of these blades.I DON'T like the residue build-up where the blade motion reverses/ returns to ""start"" position."
1,Does not fit 2007 Honda Civic Hybrid,"Contrary to Amazon's car fit tool, this product does not work with the 2007 Honda Civic hybrid. The aerodynamic spoiler on the wipers doesn't allow for the wiper to rest against the windshield because it hits against the wiper arm bracket."
1,Won't work on BMW E34 although advertised otherwise,"A complete waste of money. Installed them and discovered they won't work because they're completely designed wrong for the E34 BMW. Can't return it because it isn't in original unopened condition. And there's no way to know that before you install it. They make fine blades, but their compatibility chart is inaccurate when it comes to BMW."
5,Best....Wipers....Ever,"I bought some RainX Latitudes last year and then the new RainX Repels more recently. With both RainX sets I had complaints. From noise to streaking to short lifespan, they led me to believe that I should just save my money and buy cheap wipers from now on. Recently, someone on my car's forum posted about these PIAA Sporza's so I decided to try an expensive set one more time. I followed the included instructions perfectly and wow these wipers are amazing. Rain on the windshield rarely needs to have the wipers on when I am on the open highway, the beads of water just roll right off the windshield! When I do have to turn them on, they are unbelievably quiet and are a treat to look at at all times! I see myself forever buying PIAA blades in the future!"
4,Excellent AOR,"Great AOR. Tracks are a little bit uneven but most of them are excellent.Not the best production but better than many other productions heard.Bobby Sexton went off to form ICEBREAKERS after this one.Buy it when you see it. As far as i am concerned , this is a MUST in every serious AOR lovers collection!"
1,TRULY AWFUL,"Sorry, but this one was such a sleeper. I have no idea what novel the other reviewers read, but it was surely not this book. Due to the reviews, I purchased this book and I was quite disappointed."
2,Not for a Beginner,"I am new to R and needed to create a particular style of heat map for a project. I spent 3 weeks studying this book's table of contents, sample chapter, examples on the author's website, etc. until the day came when I needed prepare my presentation. So I went ahead and bought the book. It was not what I needed and, in fact, I have not found it useful in the 2 months that I have owned it. Before the book even arrived I discovered the R Graph Gallery ([...]), which has a heat map that met my needs. My advice to those who are beginning to learn R is to be patient and use the many free, high-quality resources available on the internet for perhaps up to a year before starting to buy books."
1,Not for real world data analysis,"If you want to learn about exotic and irrelevant graphs, such as maps of the coastline of New Zealand, then this book is for you. On the other hand, this book completely fails to address the graphical needs of 99.9% of real world data analysts. If you are one of these, don't waste your money and time. Any introductory text on R, such as R in Action by Kabacoff, will serve you better."
5,playground set ho scale,. Very good. Some Products we order did not come in the right gage and waiting a return of the dairy farm on two that wer sent wrong. Was sent as a o gage and need a ho gage. Althought the playground eq. came ok and is great.
1,SIZE WAY TOO SMALL!,HORRIBLE WAIST OF MONEY!!!!!!!! WAY TO SMALL DOLL HOUSE FURNITURE IS BIGGER !DONT BUY!!!!!!MY SON WAS SO UPSET WAIST OF MONEY!!!!!!
3,Bachman playground set,"After receiving this item, I think it is over priced for what you get. This item shouldn't cost more than $5."
4,"Very fast, Reliable CF Reader","This product is much too under-rated. I've used it many, many times with both my mac and my windows machine without a glitch. The data transfer rate is quite fast and reliable. The USB 2.0 interface makes transferring big amounts of files a breeze. It used to take my about 7 minutes for my camera to download 256Mb worth of pictures to my computer. With this reader, I do the same in about 40 seconds. For this price + some rebates you might find out there, you have a no-brainer here. Of course, the only caveat is that it only reads CompactFlash Cards, but if that's all you use, then it should not be a problem. Great Buy."
2,Worked great for 3 months...then crapped out.,"The reader was great for about 3 months. It was fast and easy to use. All I had to do was plug it in, look for the removable drive and get my pics. I tried to use it today and it won't work. Tried it on two different computers so I know it's not the computer's fault. I left the reader in the UBS for a couple minutes and noticed it was really hot when I took it out. This didn't happen before. There was also a strange burnt smell coming out of it...I'm glad it didnt kill my compactflash card.It sucks that PNY only has a 90 warranty on the readers...I wonder why? It was a great reader when I did work...but after 3 months it died on me and of course it's past the warranty date. I'd find another reader that at least has a 1 year warranty."
3,Useful but Pedestrian,"While this book has some useful tips on plotting, it seems most useful to people whose aim is formulaic genre fiction.Mr. Bell doesn't seem particularly well read, because about half of his examples come from Dean Koontz, who he refers to as ""the master"". Many of his other examples come from popular movies and other thrillers. The only literary examples he offers are The Catcher in the Rye and Moby Dick. Mr. Bell sometimes presents a sneering attitude toward authors who might eschew strict adherence to his formula.Of course, I'm not saying the techniques he describes dwouldn't apply to The Sound and the Fury. They probably do, but it would be nice to see some evidence that his story telling techniques apply to more than just the screenplay for Diehard."
3,Not finished!,I have not finished this book so I cannot properly rate it at this time. I will say that it came highly recommended to me by my mentor the assistant director of North Texas Christian Writers Assoc of which I am a member. They not only recommend this book but sell it in their resource dept.
3,A Simple Look at Plot,"Pros: Filled with suggestive ideas for creating a strong plot.Cons: As the title implies, this book is limited to plotting only. If you're interested in a broader perspective, or other writing topics you should read other books on writing.Thoughts: This book has an expansive, straightforward list of suggestions for tackling plot in a way that is easy to understand. I especially liked the Lead, Objective, Confrontation, Knock-out (L.O.C.K.) system and the idea of transitions between acts of a story being `doorways' as a simplified guideline for dramatic structure. This book simplifies and demystifies what is in some of the more elaborate books on the topic, such as Writer's Journey by Chris Vogler or STORY by Robert McKee.Summary: If you're trying to keep it simple, this book might be better than some of the others."
5,Simply wonderful!,"This book is one of my three writing bibles that I carry on me each and everyday. The other two are ""First Draft in 30 Days"" by Karen S. Weisner, and 'Writing the Breakout Novel"" by Donald Maass. I love ""Plot and Structure."" I feel that it's an invaluable tool for writing a truly gripping novel. Anyone can write... but not every novel is gripping... yours will be with this book:) Thank you for the incredible tool!"
4,practical advice,"Plot & Structure is a good, solid addition for everyone's craft bookshelf. The best part is Bell's LOCK system, which I use whenever a scene seems to wander or lacks impact. LOCK gets me back ontrack and moving the plot forward."
5,A Really Superb Guide,"I cannot add much to the multitude of great reviews on Amazon.com other than to put my hand up too and say ""This book was is one of the best books on writing that I know"".While there are so many vital aspects to writing, I hold plot and structure to be the the most important. There is nothing more frustrating than a book that leaves you with unanswered questions or where the plots don't flow well. When I first started to write, I bought the whole Write Great Fiction series. This title was one of two that ended up so highlighted that it was easier to spot the whitespace that the good bits.In all seriousness, if you are embarking on a writing career (or hobby) pick up a copy of Plot & Structure and devour it from front to back."
5,Things you need to know and how to love writing,"One of the other reviewers said that this book had been recommended and then exceeded his expectations. I can only agree. Solid information, excellent presentation, and fun to read. Frankly, the author, Bell, can stop writing novels and just do these. Good work."
2,This book teaches a formula for writing formulaic fiction,"If you want to write a cliche-ridden, predictable novel that mirrors the inept style of many mass appeal best-sellers, then this book may help you in that endeavor. It gives practical advice, such as buy a mug that says ""Writers"" to keep on your desk for motivation, listen to music to get inspiration for plot ideas, steal well-known plots and give them a bit of twist, write your book and at the last minute change the ending for shock effect. The author assumes that all plots are based on a character facing an adversary and adds little to (possibly detracts from) the Hero's Journey paradigm.A much better option is to read Orson Scott Card's book on Characters and Viewpoint. Card writes a little about plot in that book, but the few pages he devotes to the subject have far more gems than Bell's entire book. Nancy Kress's Beginnings, Middles and Ends is also good."
3,Pretty Good but windy.,I got a good bit out of this book. Like many of it's kind though it is a lot longer that it needs to be. A lot of it could be cut out. You'll find yourself skimming in certain areas. Unless of course you just have an endless amount of time on your hands. It was worth getting though.
5,great book about writing.,This is a must-read if you are interested in writing or you are a beginner writer. With many excercises and good information.
4,"Good, very good, just short of being great","If you are a young writer looking for quick, solid advice on how to develop your craft then this book is an excellent place to start. If you are an experienced writer with a couple professional publications under your belt but you still have your doubts about your ability to make money at the craft of fiction, then this book will add greatly to your toolbox. However, if you've taken a few college level creative writing classes, or if you've already got a novel on store shelves and are working on your second, it would better to keep on writing and leave this book for someone else.An informative read for a new or still unpublished writer. An interesting perspective for an experienced writer."
5,Enlightening!,"This is the 2nd best book I have read on writing, the first being Techniques of the Selling Writer by Dwight Swain. That being said, I believe these 2 books should be read together. If there was anything left unclear by DS, this book covered it. It's very well written, and I will keep it close-by as a handy reference. I especially like how James Scott Bell explains 3 act structure and character arc. Thank you!!!"
5,Snyder County History,"This is an excellent source of information for Snyder County, Pennsylvania. There are a lot of pioneer names listed here dating back to the first settlers of the county."
1,Confusing explanations and wishy washy advice.,"The author's explanation of a parameter called names includes an example setting the parameter to, what else, ""names"", as in, names = ""Names"". Other commands and parameters have no examples with no evident pattern, but generally make it hard for the reader to understand.The author presents both sides of controversial topics with no indication of which side she is on. It you're going to be an expert, you ought to have an opionion."
5,Quick Ref,"This little book has become a standard trapping of my desk. I think I would be lost without it. Put into the popular ""nut shell"" format it is user friendly and can be used quickly and acurately."
5,A must have,"This book is a must have for web designers who want the most up to date information about web publishing. It is the most comprehensive HTML reference I've seen, with just enough examples. Lots of other great things are covered such as the basics of UNIX, so the average person can get the 30,000 foot view of web technology without feeling overwhelmed."
3,This book is not about design.,"I think it is appalling that this book got such rave reviews. ALthough it is a good HTML (and more reference), it misses the point of good web design - you can know all the technique, but if your pages don't look good, then you're missing the boat (hence the word, _design_).The book does nothing for building a sense of web aesthetic into the reader. Yes, to some extent, good web design is subjective and designing for the web is a new paradigm. But now that the web is no longer entirely new and there have been some lessons learned in design, good designers know what works and what doesn't, and this book did not tell me that stuff the way some other books did.Let's not get wooed solely by the O'Reilly name. Although they treat technical aspects expectecly well, this book fails to instruct on the other half of good web design, namely, making pages that are intuitive, well-designed, and graphically superb."
5,The edges are already worn.,"This is the book I would like to have written. An easy to use reference that contains the details a professional website builder needs. The browser-compatability chart and minimum/maximum window dimension charts were worth the price alone. (I'd already spent about 4 hours trying to put one together before I found this book.)It's not a tutorial; it's a reference with a lot of explanations. If you're brand new to HTML, you *might* need something more lesson-based, but buy this one, too. Eventually, you're going to use it."
4,Outstanding Quick Reference,"As someone who learnt HTML largely by trial and error, this book provided anwsers to many of my questions and helped me introduce some sort of standard to my coding. The information provided on tables and particular browser real estate are invalueble. This book is a must for anyone who wishes to appreciate what comprises good, adequate, or poor HTML coding practice."
5,Excelente. Lo recomiendo sin duda,"Es verdaderamente bueno. Una referencia imprescindible. Si quieres hacer paginas que resulten profesionales, tienes que comprarlo. Aprenderas un monton de cosas que te costaria horrores aprenderlas sin este librito. Merece el dinero que cuesta"
4,an excellent reference.. keep it close at hand!,"This informative, clear, easy-to-read book is an excellent reference for the intermediate and above web designer. You will not be dissapointed with its appendixes.. clear descriptions of almost every tag!"
4,"No ""wet glass"" rings on this one!",This book is a webmaster's best friend. The browser compatibility charts are alone worth the cost. I doubt this one will get lent out. Current up through MSIE version 5 and all of Netscape's offerings.
4,Great for both learning and quick reference,"This book's overall view on pretty much all aspects of webdesign makes it perfect for people who are to learn some basics/intermediate web designing, as well as for more experienced readers who are looking for a good reference book for when memory fails - without this book I would've been stuck for hours trying to remember some style sheets properties and a few basic javascript that kept slipping out of my mind. A life saver!"
4,Great for CSS reference,"Could be more comprehensive, but I guess I should have bought a CSS book for that!! Overall, it's a great reference to have for the kind of person that does programming and design of websites."
5,The Best Reference Book around,"This has to be the best reference book around for web design. It covers all concepts of web design and includes a full list of tags in the HTML 4.0 specification plus what is and isn't proprietary to a particular browser. From CSS to Javascript to Images and SSI, this book brushes the basics on everything. It isn't a book for learning about web design, it was written for those who already know something but need quick look ups. I keep this book next to my computer at all times and even take it with me on the road if I know I'll be working on design. I always refer to this book first when I have a question on web design. It is a must have reference book!"
4,Good desktop book,"The nutshell series books has another winner. Nice compact book that fits on your desk with a wealth of concise, useful information. In 30 minutes I found 6 things that I had be trying to figure out how to do for a year. Covers what works in what browser, really well. Very readable too."
3,I only tested this for video enhancement,"I don not have superior audio for my tv, but i do have a 720p tv so i figured i would get theses and see if i noticed a difference. It looked a little clearer, its probably worth the few dollars i paid for it. I would have gotten the other av pack with component cables, but most games do not support them any way, so i think these are more practical. (you can see if a game supports it by checking the back to see if it says 420p or 720p) Overall it enhances the experience. As dfor audio i can not tell you how well it works, but from reading other reviews its is amazing."
1,"Great for Audio, Terrible for Video","I used the ""Advanced A/V Pack"" for many years and never realized back when I purchased it that S-Video was only capable of 480i Standard Definition (SD) resolution. For some reason I must have thought that S-Video was capable of 480p/720p/1080i back then.In any event, you really need component cables to get that HD Quality video playback. I recommend ditching this and purchasing the HD Pack to get the Digital Audio (S/PDIF) and the Component Outs (Y/Cb/Cr)."
3,Worked ... kinda sorta,"Well, I could not get my windows XP machine to boot when my new SATA hard drive was connected to the PCI card. However, after I was in Windows, I was able to connect my hard drive and Windows saw the drive (I had the case open and the drive on the outside -- total Frankenstein Monster set-up). When I tried to configure the drive in the Bios, the drive was not recognized, or it wouldn't let me in to configure. Total nightmare.I'm giving it three stars because it did detect the drive once in Windows, and I was able to copy valuable info unto the drive. I ended up getting an external drive shell to house the SATA, after the data was transferred. The bottom line: your mileage may vary."
5,this book rocks,"This is a great book, I have read almost every book out there on Vietnam and this as good as any. Very similar to 'GUNS UP' which I read just before this . Yes the writing style is different but very funny and a welcome variation. I imagine the author had to find some way to deal with all that he went through. If you like this kind of book you won't be disapointed, the action scenes are great."
2,I don't think he was there,"While Ogden's writing is pretty good, the facts are way out of line. He refers to the M-79 as being twenty millimeter when in fact it was forty millimeter. He also says that he changed his underwear as often as he could. No grunt ever wore underwear in 'Nam because it caused nasty jungle rot in the crotch. He amkes numreous other mistakes that only someone who wasn't there would make. The book is BOGUS."
2,Lightweight Book,The book is long on words and feelings and short on substance. I wonder if the feelings are accurate for the events described or were dreamt up afterwards. It's really a series of vignettes in florid prose that doesn't quite ring true to me.
1,Disappointed,"I am always glad to see new work on the Vietnam War. It is also very difficult for me to be critical of the authors out of respect for their experience. Unfortunately, that's not where Ogden takes me. I felt as though I were reading about a group of sadistic Boy Scouts in a very bent version of the ""Lord of the Flies""; rather than the United States Marine Corp. I think that Ogden is obviously a talented writer and perhaps I really don't understand his approach. I do know however that I was disappointed and didn't feel enlightened in one way or the other."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"Warren Ellis starts his excellent revamp of Stormwatch here, as he totally changes the lineup, and splits Stormwatch into multiple teams, each with a different purpose.Stormwatch needs all their firepower, when The High comes back out of his self imposed isolation, and decides to reshape society in his image.Jenny Sparks had known him in the past, so they end up talking before the confrontation. Top notch hero fare."
3,Quality Stormwatch,"Definitely the better of the Stormwatch collections, due in no small part to the Bendix character. This volume certainly questions the nature of superheroics, but the follow-through is sadly disappointing.As becomes painfully clear, writing action is not Ellis strong point. The build up to a massive brawl at the conclusion of the ""Change or Die"" story arc leads nowhere, as characters fall into debates with each other over their role.Bendix's return is teased at in the final issue collected here, but is never revisited during Ellis's run. Oh well."
1,Warren Ellis Issues,"This collection spotlights Warren Ellis and his issues with Superheroes and his consistant need to deconstruct them and in many ways ruin the image that they have had for decades. Once again we get a heavy dose of the 90's era Punisher Style clones out to prove thier way is the right way. There's realistic then there is someone with issues. I've read Stormwatch from the beginning and felt that this issue actually did them a disservice.This collection rates low, down with Grant Morrisons Punisher Kills the Marvel Universe."
1,How not to write superheroes,Superheroes should be role models and display morals that define them as heroes. Not be self-destructive beings with visions of being more then human as displayed in this story. I don't care for these stories. Give me mainstream Marvel and DC books to read over Ellis's stuff anytime.
1,worst tent ever,im part of bsa and the very first time i slepted in this tent it rained but not that much and nothing had goten through but in the morning i saw that there was a pudele right nexted to me and know what it was from the duw. if i was u i would read this review and then buy a coleman (with weather tech). that i also have. so DONT BUY THIS TENT.
3,Good for system integrators; not for software developers,"I was disappointed. I was looking for a low-level book that would help me understand the IEEE-488 standard and hopefully some insight into the chips that implement this standard (e.g., TMS9914A). The book addresses topics that are of interest to a system integrator; not a software engineer."
3,Dries hair well but towel smells!,"I've been using microfiber towels for about ten years. This is my third one. They all eventually get an odor to them. I'm not sure why but they do; I've tried drying them, without any softener in the dryer. I've tried drying them outside. I don't know what causes the smell.My first towel never smelled. It was white so I'm wondering if there might be a correlation between white Microfiber towels and those with color. At any rate, I replaced the white one when it got too stiff to be of any use.My next one was dark blue and it developed the odor so I use it now to remove hair from my cats after I brush them. It does a great job!This is towel number three and it arrived with the smell! So who knows what causes it? I shall use it until I can't stand the smell any more and delight in the fact that the smell doesn't transfer itself to my hair and it cuts down hair-drying time by about half."
2,Waste of money,"I have long thick curly hair. This towel does not make my hair dry faster. I need two of these towels, because they are very thin, and the first towel becomes saturated after a few minutes, so I have to use a second towel. One normal thicker cotton towel does the job. This towel is also not quite large enough to make a good turban. It creates a ton of static in the dryer with my cotton towels. My hair is not any less frizzy. I tried the ""plunking"" method and that did not improve my curls and made my bangs go wierd. So save your money. This is an overpriced synthetic towel. Maybe good for your gym bag if you have short or thin hair."
4,Nice towel.,"This microfiber hair towel does what it says. It does seem to dry my hair faster than a regular towel. That was the main reason why I purchased it. My only complaint is the color. It is quite different from the picture. It is more of a bright mint or celery, which is fine, but I would have preferred the color shown."
3,Average - I liked the color,I also liked the vinyl bag/package. I thought the towel would be more absorbant and my hair would dry faster. Otherwise it is very nice.
5,Excellent Seller,Book was in perfect condition as promised. Service was great and shipping was on time. The price was also very reasonable. Overall excellent seller. Would buy from again and recommend to others.
4,I Have These For Exactly A Rainy Day Such As This,The format is all weird for these; but if you love them then waiting for all episodes in one package is kind of not possible.
4,"Great, now that it's on DVD",I miss this show sooooo bad. I was like 6 or 7 when I watched this show and it was great!!!. I'm 15 now and I sometimes still remember old episodes or wish it would still be on!! WHY??? can't there be any good cartoons on in this era. NO!! we have to sit and watch 24 hours of Japaneese CRAP. Well the DVD is great and get it if u liked the show
1,If it sounds too good to be true...,"I had such high hopes for this iron-on labeler tape so I am very dissapointed. I have two kids in preschool so I need to label everything, and I haven't found a way to use permanent markers to write neatly and without bleeding through the garment, and I'm not really good with a needle and thread, so this iron-on labeler tape seemed like the perfect solution. Each label went on fine with no lifted edges or anything that indicated there'd be trouble. But after the very first wash, ALL OF THE LABELS FELL OFF. I tried them on a variety of clothing - denim, khakis, cotton t-shirts, cotton thermal shirts, and I waited to wash the items until a day after application to allow it to ""set up""... but each and every label came off on the very firstg wash. I just wasted $20."
3,great product but......,this would be a great product except it is NOT compatible with Magellan Roadmate 1700. other than that it's a very solid mount.
3,Lacks real world examples,"This book is well written and successfully teaches the basics of Servlet programming.However, when it comes to designing serious industrial application architectures using servlets, your still very much on your own."
4,Excellent book on Servlets and Java,If you do not understand servlets and program in Java this book is for you. I found it very easy to read and comprehend right off the bat. The examples are excellent and you will get off writing servlets very quickly. It is somewhat shallow in complex examples but then again how complex are servlets. Some best practices and commercial examples could have helped a lot.
1,"Good subject, not so good book","'Java, Servlet Programming' is too scattered and not low-level enough. There is just not enough information in this book -- too much cookbook stuff. Lots of code with no explaination of what's going on."
1,Suitable cover graphic...,... all hot steam and no substance. why buy an out of date book when all of the material is freely available on the java soft web site?
1,"Frustration galore, Try it dont just read it!!!","I read this book and was extremely frustrated, It is by no means a good book, may be not for newbies, the book was passed on to me from someone else who was frustrated with it. It probebly is a good book for established Java programmers to fully grasp the concepts as the experienced Java programmers around me have said, However if you try the examples you will find that you cant get passed chapter 3.I already submitted a bad review of this book which does not appear in the posted reviews I must assume that Amazon.com does not post bad review of this book for one reason or another, and I cannot understand why there are so many good reviews for such a rush to print book, may be the next edition will prove to work better, Although I doubt if I will try it."
1,"Disapointing, not for beginers nor experts","I do not recommend this book. It does not keep the usual ""level"" of the O'Reilly ones.The prose is a bit boring and there is not much insight on the subject (nor covers a beginner view on the subject)."
2,Java Servlet Programming,"I think this book is very helpful in general servlet programming. But, it doesn't go enough depth in J2EE intergration issue. For example, the integration of EJB with the servlet is covered, but I don't see how you can integrate TOMCAT with a EJB container (J2EE RI for example) with the presented material."
4,Excellent Book,This is an excellent book on java servlet programming for the beginners. Some examples in the connection pooling area need improvement. Thanks to the author for writing such an excellent book. It is time for an updated or new book by the author (both on servlets and jsp).
2,Not good for the beginner,"The book starts of well but then gradually becomes unsuitable for the beginner. Too many things are assumed that the reader knows. I recommend ""Developing Java Servlets"" by Goodwill. Its cheaper and better. More code examples too."
5,This book answers every question I have had.,This is an excellent source for anyone who's got moderate programming experience and needs to learn servlets and have a reference.
2,"The book's not bad, but it's not as good as others","When I first started reading Jason Hunter's Java Servlet Programming, I thought it was great. But after reading several other servlet books, I realize it was really only mediocre. ""Inside Java Servlets"" for example has much more material, and is a much better title to learn from."
2,Not good if you're going mainstream...,"There are certainly some folks out there who want to know about the whole range of alternative Servlet frameworks (tea, webmacro etc.), but there are also those who just want to (or have to) stick with the standard which, like it or not, is JSP with Taglibs.I really liked the first edition if ""Java Servlet Programming"" (gave it 4 stars), which was timely and thorough. Consequently I did not hesitate to purchase this second edition, which I instinctively thought would cover this important part of J2EE.Yet I think I got through Hunter/Crawford's section on Taglibs in around 15 minutes having previously gotten a great deal more out of various tutorials at javasoft, apache and other websites.Still, if you want an overview of alternative techniques around, this may be the book for you."
4,Very helpful for first-time servlet programmer,"I bought this book because I had just finished reading the Java Black Book and hated it. This was a much more serious and insightful presentation of servlet programming; just what I wanted. The examples are useful, and I was able to build a 100% Java e-commerce Web site using this book alone. The JDBC and session tracking chapters were invaluable."
5,This book will make you an O'Reilly fanatic!,"This book is tremendously well written. I have spent the past year reading lots of java books and I can honestly say that this is one of the best. Every chapter teaches you new, useful concepts and it doesn't 'clutter' the pages with too many useless examples. A definite 5 stars from me."
5,A very pragmatic book on Servlets,"This book is a super book to read after O'Reilly's ""Exploring Java"". As a new Java programmer, I'm very pleased that I could get up and running with Java Servlet's so fast. Add in George Reese's ""Database Programming with JDBC and Java"", and you can write some pretty cool database servlets."
2,not so good,"We all know the deployment of servlet could be very messy, especially you port application from one web server to a different web server. For complicated application, this book didn't give clue of how to deploy, say, chat server on popular web servers such as apache with Jserv. I found it difficult to put his chat room server to work on apache. Although ""Hello world"" servlet works, it really doesn't matter to me because this is a small toy application only. Anyone tried to deploy his chat room servlets working on appache and could share with us how to do it?"
3,Assumes a lot of things.,This book assumes that the reader knows a lot of things about Web programming and HTTP protocol in particular.Although the authors do give an impression that they know a lot about the topic (they use BIG technical terms very often) but somehow are NOT able to come to level of starter and explain from the basics.I would recommend that one must have some knowledge of HTTP and some internet programming before he can grasp concepts from this book.Even in-depth knowledge of Java doesn't help in grasping the concepts of this book right from start.OR I would recommeng the autor to include a bit detailed chapter covering the basics of internet programming before rushing on to developing servlets.
3,This book can be (and should be) shorter,"Very good material in the book. However, some example programs should be grouped together to illustrate more ideas in fewer pages. This should be a 200+ page book rather than a 500+ page book."
3,No coverage of multi-threaded servelet model,"I was dissapointed that there was no mention about multi-threaded servlet model at all. Also, the chapter on Internationization has little to do with Java Servlets."
5,A Well-Rounded Coverage of the Subject,"It's interesting to see that most of the negative reviews on this column are either completely unhelpful - or related to the fact that the sample code does not compile.More advanced programmers don't tend to simply duplicate programs from books, they tend to read the information provided by the writer, and write programs that do something useful.This book may not contain any information that isn't already on the Internet, but that can be said of almost any Java book, as Java is particularly well documented.I found this book to be informative, well-written, concise, well-indexed, and well-organised. It also taught me a few things that I hadn't expected to learn, and I appreciate that."
4,A very good book on Servlets,The author has covered what is needed in a very lucid and simple manner. I feel the first chapter is a little bit shorter to make a beginner understand the scope of a servlet. I recommend Sun's tutorial to initially set up the environment to run your first servlet.Also an extra chapter on web servers would have saved a lot of time and money for me. The chapters on Servlet life cycle and HTTP basics are excellent.I recommend this book to any body who is trying to get their hands on Servlets.
3,quick but effective way to learn good servlet programming,this book will help to port CGI-Perl application to java servlet you will get answers of some good technical questions
1,No compile? No comprende Java?,"If this author knew Java, his code examples would have compiled.p>q!q!pqed."
3,OK for beginners,"I wouldn't say this is an excellent book, but it's not bad. The book covers good fundamentals in its first 8 chapters for those beginning Servlets. The book also covers some useful information on JDBC and Java Server Pages. There's also some additional coverage on Applet-Servlet communication, Internationalization and Tea & WebMacro application frameworks. However some topics like JavaBeans, SSL, Filters, deployment descriptors and XML were too brief and should have been given some depth. Another dissappointment is that all examples are based on API 2.2 but not 2.3!!. The Appendix just touches on new features of API 2.3 with also a separate listing of API 2.3.It's been 8 mths since I purchased this book. I'd suggest that starters either wait for the next edition or get something that is based on Servlet API 2.3."
2,Cookbook approach annoying,"People say all sorts of wonderful things about this book, and Iagree with most of them (well written, easy to follow etc).I have one problem: The authors use other people's code to do things they should describe themselves.For example: In their chapter on putting images in to servlets, the authors use some guy's GIF converter as part of their code (I realize that GIFs are a protected format, but the author's themselves say that they could have used JPEGs, which is what I think they should have done). I hate that kind of cookbook junk! If I wanted to go on to the web and download some idiot's class to stir in to a servlet, why would I buy a book on servlets? Of course, this is not the only example...If you're the kind of person who likes the ""Perl Cookbook"", fine, this book is great; but if you're the kind of person who really wants to know the ins and outs of servlets, try to find some other book."
5,One of best written book,This is one of the best written technical book I ever owned( and I owned close to 100). Concisely written and presented especially for a new technology like servlet. Whoever with the one star rating for this book surely missed the gem.
2,doesn't amazon read the reviews?,"I bought this book after reading the reviews here on amazon. Although it is an okay book on servlets, the reviews here are a bit overdone, and I was let down after finding problems early on in the examples. The price is right (although you can get it cheaper on fatbrain.com) for the quality of the content, as a lot of the stuff can be taken from Sun's servlet mailing list or the FAQ and servlet documentation.I would have given more stars if I hadn't felt so let down."
4,Good stuff,Well written and informative. I'd say that this book is up to par with O'Reilly's other Java books.
1,Old news,"I bought this book expecting it to cover the lastest Servlet specifications. Dont' waste your money, because most of the servlet material printed here is outdated."
5,Well-worthed the money!,It cuts through most foods like butter. It rusts easily. I had to remember to dry it right after washing and wrap it with papertowels to keep the moisture out.
4,somewhat satisfied with item.,"the description when i purchased item included 50 water purification tablets. when i purchased item they were not in package. those tablets were the key item that made me choose this product over another, so i returned item asking for another one and stated reason. retailer, quickly shipped out another item, but when i received it, it too had no water tablets. everything else in kit is great, just description needs adjustment. package was shipped and received without problem. they were quick to ship out 2nd package."
4,This book is very informative about Uighur lives in Xinjiang,"As a Han Chinese, I have always been very curious of the Uighur lives in Xinjiang. I have never had a chance to visit the Oasis mentioned in the book. From this book I leaned alot about the history, culture, customs, and even feelings of Uighurs in Xinjiang, China. I highly recommed this book to anyone who is interested in travelling and understanding other cultures."
3,skip this and buy the unofficial guide,"like many others, i bought this book expecting to find the inside tips on luxurious activities at disney world. but this book just reads like a regular guide book. and as a regular guide book, i don't feel that it is as comprehensive or useful as sehlinger's unofficial guide. to make matters worse, the info in this book is several years out of date. sehlinger's books are updated every year."
2,Lame book with little insight,"This book is titled ""luxury guide to WDW"".....there were not informative tips on staying luxury really at all. It did not even seem like the writer stayed at any of the hotels she mentioned. Like maybe she combined what she read in other books into her book. Pretty vague. The Unofficial Guide to WDW by Bob Sehlinger is WAAAAY better. I would not bother buying this ""luxury guide"" book."
3,A good guide but short on luxury,"I'm a compulsive buyer of Walt Disney World planning guides--they are my favorite virtual escape from the pressures of real life. So I was really excited when this new guide became available! After a thorough reading, though, I was in the end disappointed. It's very well written and the author displays more knowledge of the travel business than the author of any other WDW guidebook I've read. However, it fails to deliver on the promise of ""Luxury"" which I hoped to be something to make this book really special. Instead, it thoroughly covers the same ground as many other guides with more of an emphasis on value than on the really high-end opportunities at WDW. This guide failed to capture the magic and excitement of Walt Disney World for me."
3,There was nothing really luxury about this book,This book was basically the same as most of the other books on Disney. It is just compiled into one book. This book claims to tell you how to get the most out of your disney vacation and it doesn't do that. Actually the best information I have ever found on Disney and the most up-to-date information was found on All Ears Net dot Com. It has more information than you could find in any book and best of all is free.
5,Invaluable time saving tips,"Expertly written by a former travel agent and agency owner Cara Goldsbury, The Luxury Guide To Walt Disney World is an impressively informative vacation planning guide for any individual or family seeking to maximize their experience of the ""Disney magic"" to the fullest. Invaluable time saving tips concerning how to avoid the crowds, which accommodations offer the most rewarding experience for their price, where to get the neatest souvenirs, sample the finest cuisine, and a wealth of other practical travel advice make The Luxury Guide To Walt Disney World a first-class guide all the way. Also included is plenty of up-to-date information concerning Florida's two other main tourist attractions closely adjacent to Walt Disney World: Universal Orlando & SeaWorld as well. If you are planning a trip to Walt Disney World, then you want your own personal copy of The Luxury Guide To Walt Disney World!"
2,Luxury Guide should include luxury activities,"I purchased this guide to add to my collection of DIsney World travel books, and I was quite disappointed. From the book descriptions I was expecting a guide to all the luxurious activities and experiences available at the resort with great detail. This guide skims over most Disney attractions and does not provide any information that is not available via disney's website. I would like to see more details and even ballpark prices on some activities. Personal experience testimonies would also benefit the listings in this book."
2,Not that great on my bass,"I have changed from my Evah Pirazzi Weich to a Spirocore. The EP are too quiet on my bass. The change is fine for E and A , it's ok for D and it's a total disaster for G. Terrible sound, twangy and noisy pizz and bowing (a bit better in this case). I ended up using an Eudoxa G string and it works perfectly. The Spirocore G string on my bass is too thin and sounds very badly. I don't think this is generally true I know people happily using this set. In general I am not impressed. I think I will change the D string as well, Iike the Eudoxas very much. I play jazz and classical music (baroque) and gut strings (wrapped in metal) are the best."
5,Amazing fast service,"I ordered this for my office. I selected Standard Shipping, but I received it the very next day - probably less than 24 hours later. Great service."
3,its aight,"installs real easy , runs well and very reliable, i had mine for a year and still works good"
2,Durability,We love the product and would purchase more if it were more durable.We had 4 so far and the buttons stick and become unusable after 4 months.The new model is good so far and much cheaper.
2,Bad dimensions listed for product!,"This game's description on the dimensions claims to be 7 x 10"". I expected a much larger machine than what arrived.It's the same small machine that you can buy for less than 1/2 the money.Dimensions are actually 4.5 x 5.POOR DESCRIPTION. Disappointed...."
4,The french population turns out cowardice & chynical,"No French inhabitants can on a general basis be proud of their countrys efforts during the second world war, after reading this masterpiece. The funny thing about the fact that anti-fascists generally were treated worse than both the jews and the fascists is that we in some extent can find the same phenomena in todays western society. The Koestler description of the things happening to them are to be found again in todays Germany, for instance, where anti-fascicst demonstrating again the newnazis are arrested, while the nazis to some extent are given amnesty. The book shows how ""doing as believing"" will be judged as a non.conform act, as long as the majority of society prefer ""not doing at all""."
3,"Beware of scratches, dings and get longer screws","We purchased many of these knobs for our bathroom / master closet remodel. Fortunately I purchased a few extra. About 15% of the knobs had major dings and scratches on the front surface. It looked as if they were damaged during the manufacturing process and not shipping as they were individually packaged in plastic and the accompanying screw was sealed in cellophane. They are made in China.They look nice when installed but if you are using these for a drawer instead of a cabinet door, be aware that you will need to buy 8-32 x 1.5"" or 1.75"" screws as the ones that come with it are 8-32 x 1"" and are too short to clear the drawer box."
4,exactly as expected,The knob is large enough to be used comfortably. It match up nicely with another Amerock pull that was also Satin Nickel even though these two products were not matched up by the manufacturer as a pair.
2,My first Wickham/Kinsella disappointment,"Having discovered Wickham after reading the entire Kinsella collection, I was excited to learn she'd written more. I devoured Cocktails for Three and excitedly purchased The Gatecrasher hoping for another great read. I was sorely disappointed - by the ending. I throroughly enjoyed the story, even if it is a little dark, until the end. It reminded me of sitting in class as a child when charged with writing a story. I'd write a long, drawn-out story and then get tired and wrap it all up in one paragraph, just to finish. That's what The Gatecrasher felt like to me - Wickham just ended it in one page! There was great character and plot development and then it felt like she just got tired and ended it - very disappointing, especially considering how artful she is at getting Becky Bloomwood out of a bind. I will read more Wickham but with a cautious eye."
2,very disappointing,I did not like this book at all. I kept reading it hoping for it to get better or end well but I was very disappointed and hated the main character.
3,Ending that Wasn't,"Who editd this? The author is capable of so much more!I love, love, love Can You Keep a Secret. In fact, I've read it 17 times (I read about 500 words per minute so a book goes very quickly) and like the Shopaholic Series. Cocktails for Three is a satifying, fun, well-woven tale. You can tell a lot of thought went into how the 3 stories- each could stand alone-- worked together. This book left me feeling flat. I kept waiting for the engine to turn on, but it was sitting in the garage the whole time. And the ending- Kinsella (who writes under different names) excels at pulling things together- left this one mid-scene. It was like she ran out of time and sent it off in an email, unfinished. I actually wondered if a chapter was missing. Awful feeling.I gave it 3 stars because it was an entertaining diversion on a transatlantic flight, but very unsatifying ending. She's capable of so much more!I would not have bought it if I had known."
3,Different,"I am a HUGE Kinsella fan, so I thought I would give her books under Wickham a try. They really are not the same at all, but they are a good read just the same. She really keeps her writing personalities seperate, and its like she takes the absolute need for a ""tied together happy ending"" to the Kinsella side, and not as much to the Wickham side. When reading this I expected it to all come together in the end, and it did, in its own way.If you are looking at this to find some of Kinsella, you will be disappointed. If you treat this as a totally different author with a similar premise of books, but different style, you will enjoy it.Happy reading!"
4,Not bad...abrupt ending.,Story was interesting but it ended too abruptly. But that's how i feel about most Madeleine Wickham books...
1,Quite boring with none of the wit you expect from this author,I normally love Sophie Kinsella's books but this book was very disappointing. I thought the characters were not very interesting or very well developed. The ending was extremely bad with everything sewn up nicely but not very satisfying.
3,Not too bad... not too good.,"I give this book 3 stars because I actually finished it, but it required some effort. Can't say I liked the heroine of the story - she was so emotionally empty. Even when she starts being kind to others, she turns around and becomes a cold fish. I think she has attachment disorder and I found the ending depressing (even though I think it was suppose to be a ""happy"" ending)."
2,Not a good book,I love Sophie Kinsella's books so I was expecting to enjoy this Madeleine Wickham book. None of the characters are likeable and the story is very slow. I was bored reading it and pretty much had to force myself to finish it.
3,tangled web of deceipt,"What truths and what lies can be found in any relationship? Of course, one built on truth will likely survive and ones established in a lie will likely reach their demise that much sooner. Nonetheless, I found myself rooting for the relationship between Fleur and Richard, the two main characters of the novel, to succeed in spite of their shaky start.Fleur is an excellent con-artist and Richard is looking to be loved. When Fleur shows him affection after years of a loveless marriage, he can't help but be sucked into Fleur's web. The characters are written in such a way to make them realistic in their emotional voids; Fleur has a bravado to hide her true feelings and Richard's stoicism slowly dissolves.Unlike flightier books by her pen name, Sophie Kinsella, The Gatecrashers has a darker side. Some of the character development is weak, with the side members of the family rather predictable in action and words. A decent read for those who like chick-lit with an edge."
1,Didn't like it...,"There wasn't a chick lit book I didn't like. Until now. They were all fun and light. This one wasn't interesting. All of the characters (as other reviewers described) are dark and just annoying. They don't make me warm up to them, and I certainly didn't bond with the book. It took me probably a month to finish this book. I just wasn't interested. Meh. I won't pick up another Wickham book. I'll stick to Kinsella!"
3,The Gatecrasher,"The Gatecrasher was an enjoyable beach read. The book kept me interested until the end, but I would never read it over again."
3,"OK Read for Chick Lit, Shopaholic Better","I wanted something light to read, and this worked well. I just couldn't get into it. I didn't like the characters and couldn't identify with them. They weren't endearing, and the storyline was definitely predictable. I think there are better options."
2,Disappointmentville: The Gatecrasher by Madeleine Wickham (aka Sophie Kinsella),2 out of 5 stars. I so wanted to like this book. I really did. For the most part it was fine up until her big secret (or the main one) comes out and I just had to skim through the rest to find the ending. =0P A majority of the characters I loved ..... except Philippa was a bit to whiny for me and her husband was too much of a jackass for me to read through.Review By: From Me to You ...

2,Not a fan. Sorry,"Didn't really like this book. I really enjoy Sophie Kinsella. When Sophie writes under Madeline Wickham she looses her spark. I have read all the Sophie Kinsella books and look forward anxiously to the next one. But Madeline Wickham, I could take them or leave them."
3,Next time - Short and sweet,"For future reference - short and sweet!I'll pay more for a short book that covers the important stuff for the exam itself than for an exhaustive repetition of all of the exam criteria on the MCDBA web site. I don't really care what MIGHT be on the exam according to Microsoft. I just want to know what IS on the exam.This is an EXAM CRAM not a coverage of all knowledge domains for the exam. If I wanted a full source book for reference, I'd buy the Black Book or something like it.Next time - shorter is better!!!The end of book self test was the best thing about this book. At least that covered only similar items to what I saw on the test. I could probably have skipped the rest of the book and passed the test just with that. Maybe I should rip out the CramSheet and the self test next time - that would be more of a CRAM.This is one I won't read again. I read it, I passed the exam, file-13, enough said."
2,Not Sufficient,"This book gives you alot of facts to remember and no examples to use. The test was all configuration and security scenario questions and alot of stuff in the book was hardly covered like backup and recovery, DTS, BCP, DBCC statements, replication, maybe one question each on these. No questions at all on steps to take during installation and configuration. I will be looking for something to supplement this with.."
2,Not worth my money,"This is my 12th exam cram book. What a disapointment this book is. Way too much space wasted telling us how to click our way through the Enterprise Manager. The exam does not test you on clicking your way through the EM. I went back to my old SQL 7 Exam Cram which is much better. And please...for god's sake, what's the deal with Modal? Does the author work with SQL Server? With their proficiency using the Enterprise Manager, one would think you could clearly see it's called Model! Please..."
2,Not very useful,I read the entire book in 2 days... there is nothing in the book to actually remember... No concepts are described... all you see in this book are the screen shots of Enterprise Manager...Honestly I don't recommend this book. I didn't try the Microsoft press book.. If I were to choose between this book and the Microsoft press book I would go for the Microsoft press book because I am very sure that any other book will have more information than this book. This book has nothing at all.. believe me.. NOTHING to read for the test.I have used several Exam Cram books before and all of them turned out to be very useful other than this book. This book is not at all comparable with other books so use other books for your preparation.GOOD LUCK
4,.hack//ENEMY: Contagion Booster Box,"""How much fun is this toy?""If you like .hack, and you like card games, you'll probably like the card game.It was fun opening 30 packs and seeing what I got.""How would you rate this toy's educational value?""Can't really say for sure, how many card games are educational?The game would probably be too difficult for a kid to understand.It's not as if someone would pick this up if they weren't already into .hack anyways.""How durable is this toy?""If I bought this solely to collect and not open I would be disappointed.There were some dents in the box(probably from shipping) and the top part where it opens was partially open.The cards themselves are like any cards, unless they're taken care of they wont last very long.""How do you rate this toy overall?""30 booster packs, 11 cards per pack, $21~.How many other booster boxes for other card games can you buy for that cheap that contains 330 cards?Great value for any .hack fan."
3,Extensive subject coverage but be warned of ERRORS.,"Unfortunately, this edition has some serious typographical errors. Considering this is the second edition, I believe the publisher should release an errata page separately and made it available online for readers to download.I sincerely hope that the publisher/authors make a thorough revision in the next edition.Otherwise, an excellent book."
4,Not a bad buy at all,This book is great for dealing with fire technology/Fire protection engineering courses. I can see it's practical use in the field as well due to the fact that the concepts are explained thoroughly and good examples are provided to common problems
4,Arizona Summer,"A high rating is given for Arizona Summer only because it featured Lee Majors. Story-wise, it smacks a little of that Hayley Mills classic ""The Parent Trap"". However, the comparison stops there. There are some fine Arizona scenery and good old camping antics. The kids seem like a fresh breath in a weary campsite. Here, the Lee Majors character, represents the tired Arizona outback, an old timer who still packs a punch (ponch) and no shortage on wits and guile even when his knee is not in the best condition. The sublimal part of the story is spiritual, religious and moralistic, like ""Seven Heaven"". Good family entertainment for couch potatoes without an agenda. As a person who loves camping out, this is good inspiration for my next camping trip. Camping is a good place for family bonding."
4,Short and sweet,"THis is a simple fun family movie. It was filmed in my home town and I am actually an extra at the very beginning walking a dog. I got to meet all the actors and everyone. Having said that, this is just a very simple, fun, movie for everybody, not the best, but worth seeing."
3,It is ok. Camp Dome 2 REI is a better buy,"Easy to setup and everything stated in the specs is accurate.We tried this one but did not feel it would work for us. Ended up getting Half Dome 2 Plus. A comparable (price-wise) Tent for this one would be Camp Dome 2 which has 2 doors and more importantly, extra vestibule space and weighs the same.Would consider this seriously if it was priced at/around 80$."
3,Death of a Worldly idea...,"Death World had all the makings and concepts of what could have been a fun and exciting sci-fi romping adventure.But alas, that was not to be. Very quickly this reader was bored with the lack of details this writer exuded very quickly. The weapons and very survival aspects of keeping alive in such an environment was literally ignored. That made this novel soon become humdrum in what wa ssupposed to be high-octane action/adventure reading.But without cohesive characterizations, as well as solid soldier survival tactics, unfortunately this novel quickly took a nose dive for me.When it comes to solid writing in this Warhammer genre, you need to look for better writers such as Dan Abnett, Ben Counter and Graham McNeil. Right now, they are the top three dogs."
3,"Good if you want to become an expert, not good for how-to.","If you wish to become an in-depth expert in Java security, this book is for you. But if you just want to find out how to add specific aspects of Java security to your applications, this book is the long way around the block. It would be better to have some how-to examples early in each chapter, followed by the background and theory of each concept. Instead, you have to figure out ""how-to"" based on the discussion."
3,This book needs a revision.,JDK 1.5 has many updates to platform security as well as APIs. I bought this book recently and it does not have updates after jdk 1.4.
5,Excellent JAVA book covering all security issues,"A good introduction and explanation of the Java language security (sandbox, security manager, access controller and class loaders). The same for criptography, it is clearer than Java criptography. It includes great chapters for SSL and JAAS. God job Scott (Oaks). I really recommend this book both for introduction and guide."
2,Good on intro...needs an update to JDK 1.4 and above.,"The content of this book is dated now and this book needs a revision. The book does not cover Java security from JDK 1.4 and above. I suggest to use Core Security Patterns by Steel, Nagappan, Lay, which covers Java and J2EE security todate."
3,Good Overview of Java Security,"The term ""security"" means many different things. This book deals with the built-in security features of Java, which most programmers access through the Security Manager and Access Controller. Overall, I liked this book and found it a really good introduction to secutiry. However, for the price of this book, I expected a lot more infomation. For example, I would have liked it if the author explored the cryptographic package in depth and gave more real world examples of using ciphers and encryption. ALthough this is not technically what the book is about, most people think of cryptogrophy in terms of security."
3,Ok - Not enough real How-To,This book covers Java Crypto area (the reason I bought it) in depth BUT spends more time reviewing the classes and options than explaining why you would use them or how you would use them.Generally disappointed - check out Wrox Professional Java Security...
5,"Great Security book, personal info not needed","This book provides indepth coverage of Java's Security mechanisms. Much better coverage of the API than the AW Security book. However, I really did not want or need to know that: ""In his other life, Scott enjoys ...traveling with his husband James."" (No, that's not a typo.)"
5,Tight!,KiKi Sheard is a great companion artist to a collection of Mary Mary CD's. This one right here doesn't disappoint. Cop it!~Rell.
2,Xbox Controller,The arrow buttons on the pad don't work right. Every thing else is okay. Hard to play madden with it.
5,Controller,It's very good I have had no problems using it if anyone I know is looking to buy something I will refer them to you
1,did not work,this x-box did not work i was really exited about this x-box remote coming in because my last x-box remote cord was chewed on by my new puppy and i was not going to git a new remote in till he grew out of it and when i received the remote i have been waiting on it was a wast off my money
1,the controller doesnt work!!!!,"this is a terrible product, the control doesnt work, and I alredy filed a claim, that I paid for a good product and it simply doesnt work. I tried contacting the seller but he doesnt care much in giving me back my money. I am pretty much dissapointed and asked for my money back."
1,"X Box S Controller S, Bad Button Layout","To begin with the controller is too small, and I have normal hands not freakishly big. The other thing is the white and black buttons were in a much better location on the old controller, Its hard to make my thumb bend that way quick enough. The back and start buttons were also better in the middle.I Gave the new controller a chance for about 3 weaks and It just didn't fit. As soon as I switched back over to the old one my gaming improved drastically."
1,Junk controllers,"on the product info page it says Xbox controller, but when you go to give feedback it says not original microsoft product. I ordered two of these and had them sent to my nephews for Christmas and they both broke within two days. Pioneer Marketing responded by saying ""they were new so they should be working"". Thats it. I replied and asked them if I should send them back or what and they're ignoring me. So I'm out 30.98 for two junk controllers."
1,I've been waiting a month for this item. I'm not a happy customer.,I will not order from this vendor again. I ordered an Xbox controller over a month ago and am still waiting. I'll be asking for a refund shortly.
4,Alot better than I expected,"I would recomend purchasing this controller. Smallest controller I have ever seen for an x-box, I didn't have any problems with it though. Don't buy those 3rd party controllers, because guess what? They don't work right."
2,Watch when buying controller,Watch when buying a controller that it has the proper plug on it. I just recently bought a controller and it didn't have the piece needed to connect it to the XBox. I checked a couple of my local game shops and Amazon and couldn't find anyone selling the piece I needed for the controller.
5,This is it.,"I busted two black controllers with very little effort, but my green controller has been dropped - on my ceramic tile floor - many, many times and is still going strong after 3 1/2 years. If you still need a controller for your legacy Xbox this is it."
2,BUYER BEWARE,"A lot of these XBOX controllers are cheap knockoffs made in China. I ordered two from two seperate vendors and they were both Crap! The first one ordered through Cemtronix worked for 10 minutes before biting the Dust! The second one I ordered through GameQuestDirect had all Black Buttons and no Logo. No green, red, blue, of yellow buttons, not even a white button to let you distinguish from the others.Both controls were poorly made with very rough edges and stiff buttons & toggles. If you have children, I would advise using sandpaper on the controls as they have sharp edges due to bad moldings. In short, Buyer Beware of these Cheap Chinese Knockoffs of Xbox Products!"
3,I prefer the original controller,"I don't know why people fall for this. For me, the original Xbox controller is much more comfortable to hold and press. The original one is more contoured and the buttons are softer, whereas the S controller feels stiff and rather clumsy. Of course, nothing beats the GameCube controller.The S is good if you have really small hands."
2,Controller,The controller works fine and arrived in reasonable time. Wireless is more worth the money.
1,This hardware is GARBAGE,"It seems that people have reviewed the controller S favorably, having to do with the size and comfort, etc. However, what no one mentions is that the controllers are VERY, VERY FRAGILE. I have had my Xbox for roughly six months. In that time, I have had to replace FOUR of these controllers. That is $100, yes, ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS, worth of controllers. They are not durable in any non-paperweight sense of the word.This is in the context of me also being a SNES guy. I have spend $20 in TEN YEARS for new controllers for my Super Nintendo and they work as well as they ever did.I thus advocate not buying this controller, and opting for a generic one. At least if that bombs out, you are spending less money to replace it."
1,Please explain!,"Please explain to me why you people believe the S-type controller is better. Now I know that I am probably a dissenting view on this, but I honestly love the old ""Big and Bulky"" controller. If the controller is too big for you then I guess the S-Type is a good choice, but I prefer the original. The S-Type is wierd to play with, because the black and white buttons are at the bottom of the controller instead of the top, and the layout of the analog sticks are the only thing that seem to resemble the original controller (with exception of the colors of the A B X and Y buttons)."
5,2nd best controller,"This is the best wired controller for any system. I own three and only one has broken (because my friend repeatedly threw it against the ground, when i was beating in Soul Calibur II, hehe). They can take a large amount of abuse, and keep going. The buttons are in perfect spots and they are better placed than other controllers."
1,x box controler,after one weak of using the xbox controler the cord pulled out the end and rendered it useless and it would cost more to return it than to buy a different one.
5,BEST SHIPPING EVER!!!!,"So i bought this new controller so i could play multiplayer on the old xbox for Turok:Evolution. i ordered it saturday and then BAM! tuesday after school its on my doorstep, i expected it friday the least and it really suprised me. probably the best shipping i've ever had!"
4,most reliable out of the different colors,"Having owned my xbox for about four years now, i will say that the microsoft S controllers are superior in quality to second and third party products and more often then not, a comfortable alternative to the initial controller Dukes that came with the system early on.I have all three colors of the S (hooray!), but due to constant travel of my system and its controllers between friends' houses, the blue and the green have become unresponsive. This is probably because of my practice of tightly wrapping the cords around the controller before transport. so beware: DO NOT TIGHTLY WRAP THE CORDS AROUND THE CONTROLLER!despite these years of abuse, the black has continued to troop on, leaving me to believe it is the best."
3,Good,I like this conroller but I prefer the bigger one though. I have wird hands.this is a good halo controller. I out
3,Anti-Sweep,"I like a lot those gadgets, considering my 46 years old. Most of my son's games are X-Action game that make me sweet a lot.I would put in this controller an anti-sweep coil to better grabbing."
4,so cool,"controller s is great cause every button is right there for you to use, and gettin it in blue or green or any other color is just for the heck of it, hey its same price so why not?"
4,very good!!,"This is very cool! The blue color is really awsome. I feel bad for the people who choose gamecube as they're game console. The games are cool if your like four years old, and the controler lookes like a pice of pizza. Go with the xbox."
4,cool but dangerous,"I was playing meadle of honor on my xbox and a piece of the right triger button broke into my hand. I bleed alot and there was a big cut on my finger, I thought that I was dying, but of course my wish of my death did not come true. I hoped that this poorly designed controller but it didn't so now I just by from different video game company's."
2,Hasn't arrived,"I'm not sure what happened, but I never received the controller. I checked with the front office of my apartment complex to see if they got it, but it never showed up. I'd like another sent to me immediately or I want the credit put back on my credit card. Thank you for your assistance.Jesse Melton III"
5,I have this and the salt mill. Love em!,"I discovered this item when a work buddy whipped it out at a restaurant and everyone at the table used it to pepper their steak & sides. At the time I was caught between thinking ""What is this guy nuts?"" and ""Man this thing is the most awesome thing I've ever seen."" Well I went surfing and found it and am now the proud owner of both the pepper & salt mill (both are the same exact thing). Now I don't take mine to restaurants with me, but it is small enough to easily put in your pocket yet use many times without refilling. Who knows, maybe he carried it on him in case he got in brawl, I don't know, but it's quite a nifty device and works well. Given the unique design, I don't ever see it failing or wearing, so it should last for a long time, given the spring doesn't break or anything"
2,not sure how something this simple stopped working,"I bought one of these several years ago. I like fresh pepper, and I enjoyed the modern styling. I also play drums so a pepper grinder made by a drumstick company seemed like a great idea. It worked well for about a week and then it just quit grinding. A tiny amount of pepper still comes out, but it is unusable. Maybe I broke it, who knows. Would have bought a more standard one if I had the chance to do it again."
2,Not worthwhile,"We used a set of OGGI salt & pepper grinders at a local resturant, and liked both the style and the functionalty. Searching for them on Amazon resulted in this look-alike, so we bought the set. After a lot of attempts to use them, we put them aside until we visited the resturant again. Turns out the original is taller and wider and much studier. Too late to return these, but still upset with the bait-and-switch on this site."
1,Do NOT buy this!,"Extreme piece of garbage! DO NOT BUY this. I peppered my dish and the bottom fell out because the mechanics of having a heavy metal base screw into a light weight plastic middle means the unit falls apart. It ruined the meal - luckily it was only my dish and others were spared! Had I used it over the pot, I would have had to throw out the whole dish or spend hours picking out pepper balls!"
4,stylish and functioal but not adjustable,"I really love this grinder, I think it is one of the best looking compact manual mills out there.Except, the crushed pepper comes out a little coarser than I'd like them to be, it doesn't match it's elegant look, I would have expected a finer grind... but I really do like its simple construction and the nice feel of the stainless steel.Secondly, the pump could be a little hard to push down sometimes, and it is a little annoying when the pump gets stuck in mid push.Overall though, I love this mill. Thinking of getting the salt mill too!!"
4,Works well,"It's true that using the grinder can require the use of two hands. However, this hasn't been a big issue in my use. I own two of them (one for salt, the other for pepper). When I used rock salt in the grinder, I needed to occassionally use two hands. Once I switched to coarse kosher salt, the problem disappeared."
4,may deserve 5 stars...,"solid, well made, cool looking and I think works well. wife doesn't like it because only a small amount of pepper per pump, which is true but I don't think someone would expect large amounts ""per pump"" from this... certainly good enough for peppering a meal versus cooking. I'm going to buy the salt mill to go with it. four stars because of my wife's opinion and it is a bit pricey...otherwise I'd give it five."
4,"Sturdy, but not adjustable",This is a great one handed pepper grinder with a simple and effective design. The only drawback is that the size of the grind can't be adjusted.
1,Horrible,It was super high but not long at all I couldn't even do a back bend on it and it costs soooo much to ship back I hated it it even smelled bad:(
3,Good Form but small,"I had hoped it would be a little longer, but both my daughters are enjoying it. I purchased it to allow for additional practice at home and it does serve that purpose."
4,Good book for intro to wood joinery with power tools.,"I have several of Bill's books and enjoy his style of writing,very Danny Proulx like in that everything is laid out in it's simplest terms. For each joint he goes over every power tool that can be used to make the joint, along with the pros and cons.Overall a good reference to have."
5,Awesome!,"It is a shorter meditation (20 min), and sometimes it's not enough when I'm really hyped up/anxious. But it works wonders more often than not. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!"
2,"So, So",Didn't care for this tape at all. The voice wasn't relaxing and the imaging fell short of what I expected.
1,waste of time,"Marin county New Age dribble. The narrator's voice is soothing but the words she utters are childish babble. For example "" let a white light bathe all the cells in your knee"". If you really need help with stress try Progressive Muscle Relaxation. It really works. Don't waste your time and money on this CD."
2,Not nearly long enough.,The guided meditation is alright but very short. If I realized this I wouldn't have bought it.
5,Exactly what I hoped for,"I wanted a short (20 minute) recording to lead me through progressive relaxation and would leave me feeling renewed, capable of going about my day or, if I chose, to sleep. This recording is perfect. Heidi's voice is calming, not intrusive. I like the three options on the CD, voice only, voice with waves, and voice with music. I like voice with music best, it is very soothing. Heidi doesn't include a long introduction, but gets right to deep breathing. I love this CD. It is well worth the money. I have used it to help control migraine headaches. I have recommended this CD to my family and friends."
5,one of my favorite brands of hair brushes,"Love these Acca Kappa hair brushes since I purchased my first one in Florence many years ago. I hope they keep making the one w/the wood bristles, they are the best!"
1,Bad brush,Do nopt buy. Bristles missing. Company thatI purchased the item through Amazon will not respond.
4,Step,Thumb up! This book looks good and teaches me how to draw. I have to practice everyday. I like it so much.
1,"Somewhat useful, but kind of creepy","Pros: Covers a variety of mediaCons: Limited models - no full male nudes. All but two models are female, and both males are covered. All of the females are completely nude - including the female child (not saying, ""omg, nudes! in a nude book!? But commenting merely on the male/female disparity - why AREN'T the males clearly depicted). Two of the female models appear underage - this is compounded by the author calling them ""girls"" (instead of women), and there are many, many poses of these ""girls"" (much more than the males or the clearly adult female). It actually makes me feel a bit like a lech using these models, actually.I think I will stick with Anatomy for the Artist."
4,The Dorks,"Thick and chunky power pop, complete with fuzzed out guitar and the occasional bit of organ. Loud and bouncy, just the way it should be. The Dorks aren't much for subtlety or sensitive subjects. The boys have something of a bludgeon attack, simply obliterating everything in their path. Nice to have yer head pounded out every once in awhile. Most importantly, the hooks are golden. Blissfully messy and almost impossibly heavy. Kinda like if you could create a zepplin with plutonium. If that makes any damned sense at all. The sorta album that makes summer fly by that much faster. For taht matter, the kinda disc that warms up a chilly winter night. The Dorks keep things simple, and that's simply a recipe for big ol' smiles."
4,This is a great book.,"This book is a bit dated (it's pushing 2 old years now), but not outdated. By that I mean that the basics it covers are still the basics you need, even if the relevant protocols and technologies are constantly expanding. The prose is clear, concise, and instructive. All of the examples are complete (albeit short) working programs. I haven't tried them all, but I have yet to have one fail. This includes running under JDK versions 1.1.3, 1.1.5, 1.1.6, 1.1.7, and 1.2. If an updated version is ever published, I will buy it, too."
4,An Excellent Choice,"I read this book and really enjoyed it. It is easy to read, and has lots of useful code. I like all books written by this author. If you like this book, then you should try his book on JAVA and XML. That book is well written. I would recommend this networking book to anyone who wants to learn JAVA and Networking. Some LAN experience or a networking course will help you. Buy this book -- it is worth an investment!!!"
5,Real meat inside,"Let's say you want to create a real server software from scratch for many platforms ?... what do you need ? Java, this book, and some work of course.Forget lost time wandering for clues and wannabe tutorials : update information, exemples, a comprehensive index, all is here."
1,This book is OUTDATED.,The author generously uses the methods deprecated in Jdk1.1 with a liberal assumption that Jdk1.0.2 is here to stay for a while. The best part is the book was published a while after Jdk1.1 was released. The publishers (O'Reilly) might consider changing the cover picture to a 'dinosaur'.
1,Total waste of time and paper,"Contains examples that fail to work. Also the explanations are SO BAD they don't help at all. The API docs contain more information than this ever will. I'd love to like it, but so there. Go for more general books instead."
2,"Poor book to purchase, very out of date","This book is extremely out of date, and has been superceded by the excellent Java Network Programming Second Edition, by Merlin Hughes, and published by Manning.The author of this book, posted in an earlier review ""However the cover of the Manning book has a big fish, and looks suspiciously like an O'Reilly book. Don't be fooled. The real O'Reilly book has a gyroscope on the cover."". I'd have to say to potential readers not to be fooled - buy the original (and now updated) Java Network Programming 2nd Ed."
5,Comprehensive reference (3rd Edition),"If you're doing anything with Java and Network I/O programming, the topic will most likely be covered in this book. The author does a great job describing not only how Java handles network programming, but the concepts and details of network programming in general. The book takes the core java.net classes and describes each method, what it does, how to use it, what to watch for, code examples, etc - it takes the API Javadoc and expands upon it.It's a great Java Network API reference book."
2,This book is outdated,"If you carefully go thru all the reviews , you can make out that the reviews in 1997 give a very positive feedback about the book. But at this point of time this book definetely needs a revision."
5,"Wonderful book, easy and fun to read","If you really want to understand how networking works in Java, buy this book and read it. You will not be disappointed.The book does an excellent job of documenting how the java.net package works and an even better job of displaying useful examples. Very rarely do I find my self compiling and running code examples given in books. However, with this book I did it routinely because they were just to tempting not to run!I found the chapters on HTML parsing, Threads, Sockets, JavaMail and RMI to be the most useful."
3,Not the best out of the authors books but still worth collecting,This wasn't as great as I had hoped for based on the last 2 books I have bought from this same author... but still if your interested in learning something or just getting something simple about your dreams it is still a nice addition. However most of the book contains a dream dictionary... which in my eyes makes it lose 1 star... there isn't as much spells or information as the cover leads you on to believe... which makes it lose another star in my eyes. *shrug* The authors other 2 books are much better if you ask me... check out The Good Spell Book or The Fortune Telling one
3,Dream Book,"This book was decent. It could have had more information about how to rid yourself of nightmares. I also found the dream dictionary portion limiting. I did however like the look of the book, and the binding was very nice. It still lacked something though."
2,Cute binder and idea but not a lot of substance,"Because of its cuteness it got the 2 stars. It really didn't fulfill all the things it said it would cover. The smallness and thinness of the book amazed me and the stuff inside was pretty basic. Definitely not something for the newbie, too fluffy. There are better dream dictionaries and spell books out there."
3,Pale beginning (but does get better in later volumes),"Chi-Hyong Lee, Demon Diary, vol. 1 (Tokyopop, 2000)Demon Diary has a great premise, but it suffers from that ailment some manga have of the characters looking do much alike that it's often hard to tell them apart. That said, it's a bang-up story (young, happy demon with ""traditional"" human values-- consideration, sharing, naivete, etc.-- has to be trained to be a great demon lord), packed with humor and action in roughly equal doses. With such great ideas, it's hard to see this one not improving as Lee gets a firmer hold on the characters and story arc. ***"
2,gAH,"I have to say this book is not a keeper, and really not worth the buy. It was boring and left to many unknown elements to the story, like that little rabbit kid in the begining. I will definantly not buy any further issuses because of the let down this was."
3,this book is ...i guess aiight...,"this book is aiight....butTHIS BOOK IS NOT MADE BY A JAPANESE PERSON!!!!it's korean, look at the name, and the way that u have to read it. it's read like american format..same withSOUL TO SEOUL, KING OF HELL, DRAGON HUNTER, FAERIE'S LANDING, RAGNAROK, LIGHTS OUT(ONE DAY SOMETHING WONDERFUL MAY HAPPEN), EVIL'S RETURN, and more!!!i'm tired of japanese taking credit 4 everything......"
4,quirky and fun,"The basic plotline of this story is that Raneaf is an orphan who discoveres that he is actually a ""Demon Lord"" and that Eclipse, who found him, will be his teacher and mentor, teaching him how to become an evil demon rampaging human villages and the like. The only problem is that Raneaf is the cutest sweetest boy ever and that he becomes a laughingstock of the demon world as well as Eclipse who is a very highly ranked demon. However instead of hating Raneaf and that fact that's he's lost status by being his teacher, Eclipse becomes incredibly fond of him and this wonderful relationship ensues. I really like this manga; though I am bothered at times at how feminine the characters are drawn. I would stare at new characters for minutes trying to decide if they were male or female. Raneaf is so cute and funny and of course Eclipse is mysterious, forbidding and alluring. The two of them together is pure magic; the kind of relationship that is so captivating in manga."
3,Disappointed..,Disappointed to see that this is made in Taiwan.. almost all the Lisle tools I have looked at are made in the USA.I figured this would certainly be made state side.. however it is made in Taiwan.
5,great shampoo!,"Just like the conditioner, the shampoo smells great! It leaves your hair really clean and just like the conditioner the smell fades pretty quickly. The shampoo won't work as great without the conditioner, so get the conditioner as well!"
2,JUST OK,"Found this CD in a bargain bin for $1 Was glad I didn't pay any more for it.Nothing really wrong with the music but doesn't begin to compare with the classic Christmas Carols recording now available on CD by Mantovani from the 50's. I realize this CD was recorded after Montovani's death and the notes say it is conducted by the very capable Stanley Black who did record several sessions (far better than this) with the orchestra after Mantovani's death. The music on this CD however sounds rather uninspired and bland to me.. lacking the Mantovani trademark string sound and scintillating arrangements he was known for. Were his name not on the CD, one would never guess this was the Mantovani orchestra. The chorus sings on key but little more. There are just far better Christmas CD's to choose from. For me this was a disappointment."
4,Non enclosed design can cause problems. Take care.,"The device works well, however there are a few caveats.The SATA port on the back is NOT LOCKING. Locking cables do not help here. The non locking nature can pose a problem potentially. Secure your sata line with a zip tie if you're worried.Secondly, The device is not enclosed. This means if any cables in your case dip into the area - it can block a drive from entering or worse, accidentally bump or unplug a cable in your case causing the system to go down, or data loss. Keep your case tidy folks.Otherwise - it works great. The vibration mount is a nice touch, even in a screwless case. Insertion forces are low and problem free. Devices go in easily without jiggling. Fairly reliable connections. I just wish they made the sata port on the back locking."
2,Not quite as good,"Got to love the tray-less rack.Unfortunately, this time StarTech comes a little short.1_ NO LED indication, this mean we have NO clue whether the inserted drive power or access?!!2_ NO FAN, after a while the HDD get pretty toasty, to improve it, I used VANTEC HDD cooler to cool the HDD. It helps i think, because i'm still using my five years old 160GB Seaagate HDDUntil I ran across the Tray-less bottom fan hereSATA Trayless Mobile Rack with Bottom Fan and LEDs (Patent Pending) - MR105F. It has power and access LED and TWO bottom fan to cool off the HDDI pulled the StarTech can Vantec out, now I have TWO tray-less bay with LED indicators and the HDD cooling are built-in"
5,"High Quality, Simple Design, No Bull!",Tray-less design is functional and works well when swapping drives.The SATA & Power Connections are straight thru which I prefer.Good quality and eas to install in HP case.
1,Not so good!,I previously bought a KingWin KF-1000-BK that looks just like this unit. Looks can be deceiving! This unit is cheaply built and does not fit my new 2 TB Western digital drive. I'm going to return it and buy another KingWin.
3,Dorsey Bros.,"Delivery time was prompt. Sound was very low, had to turn volumn on DVD player all the way up to hear it. Video was good."
2,Mediocre multi-game pack,"Beach Head 2000, is by far the best game in this pack. It has lots of action, and gets progressively harder. Gunship is not a high quality Helicopter sim, but it is challenging, and can be quite fun. WWII, and ""Nam"", are good games to give as gifts to people you don't like. They are both ""Doom"" style, with very poor graphics, and no redeeming qualities. Beach Head 2000, and Gunship save this game pack (....)."
3,Good Luck...,"The book is interesting, but I tried a number of the supposedly ""easy"" trick shots.. They're not easy and I'm a fairly decent shot (play in leagues etc..). I'm sure with consistent practice, you could actually make 1 or 2 of these shots, but even then they would be ""low percentage"" shots. The placement of the balls must be perfect and no text can tell where to place these balls with the kind of precision you'll need to make these shots. Just don't expect to buy this book and be making trick shots the next day.. - You'll be disappointed. Even so, it's fun just to see these shots diagramed and the historical facts/anecdotes are interesting."
4,A great addition to you pool library,"This is entertaining as well as informative, as plenty of it is narrative rather than instructional and many of the instructional tips are actually applicable to real pool games, not just trick shot displays. Anyone who already has Byrne's Standard Book of Pool and Byrne's Advanced should also get this, and his Wonderful World of Pool & Billiards book, as all four volumes regularly refer to (useful) information in each other. While this is MOSTLY a fun book about nifty tricks shots (and possibly profitable ones, if you can master them and find suckers for bar bets), your casual, league and even tournament player can learn a few good pointers from the materials herein."
3,a bit disappointing,Found much of the information this book contained on internet sites.The best thing that can be said is that I didn't have to search aroundfor hours. Main critism is that it does nothing to address those that arepre- or post-surgery.
5,Hypothyroidism,Great book for anyone with a new diagnosis. It provides the information so you can be an informed patient and ask the right questions of usually an uninformed or under-informed medical staff.
1,What he is refusing to tell you too...,"What this DR and probably many other DR's you have seen refuse to tell youis that Natural thyoid replacement is available.Using desiccated thyroid made from Porcine (pig) thyroid.The treatment is safe effective and has been around for over 100 years.If you are seeing a DR and on synthetic thyroid hormone replacementand your DRrefuses to discuss Desiccated thyroid,brand name Armour, Nature-throidand Westthroidsearch until you finda DR who will.Check out Stop the Thyroid Madness, A much better book that will explain thebenefits of Desiccated thyroid treatment.If you have doubts check out the web site stopthethyroidmadness.com before youbuy the book.You will be floored when you read everything your DR hasn't told you!"
2,A poor choice for a book on hypothyroidism,"His 2% solution is based on what? His hunch? They thyroid makes about 20% T3 not 2% and releases it slowly - no mention of using SR T3.After wasting my time reading this, I find near the back of the book (I would have stopped right there if it was in the front!) he goes full bore quack and recommends homeopathy which confirmed to me he is all ego and no science."
2,Only so so,"I'm sorry I bought this book. There are definitely better dessert books out there. This one is beautiful to look at but there isn't enough explanation to the recipes and it gets confusing. I don't have time for recipes to fail, so I've given up on this book and gone back to my favorites, Maida Heatter and Richard Sax."
2,good recipies poorly presented,I have tried several of the recipies with great success. The BIG problem that I have with this book is the text font size. The text is so small that I have to use a magnifying glass just to make out the ingredients. This makes it somewhat laborious and therefore not one of my favorite cookbooks
1,This book is no good. . . .,"I also made the brownies. They also burnt. Who bakes brownies at 400 degrees? Made no sense, but I thought. . .well the picture looks so good. I tried a few other recipes as well and the ingredients/quantities/temperatures are off. Do not waste your money on this book."
2,okay but not the greatest,"the recipes had hard to find ingredients, and they werent very good in my opinion,"
3,nothing special,"The book is fairly comprehensive, but truthfully, I use my Oracle Admin Guide more than I use 'Essentials.' In my opinion, the Admin Guide covers all the same stuff, is better organized and is actually written in a more readable/less dry manner. There's nothing wrong with 'Essentials,' but in retrospect I wouldn't buy it again. There's nothing new, and it's a bit of a yawner. I realize this is yawn material to begin with, but I'd still prefer more personality in the writing. Give the Admin Guide a shot, not all delivered docs are trash... just most of it."
2,Dissapointing,"Read the oracle documentation you can find at technet.oracle.com. It is far better. Or pick up any book on oracle database administration or pl/sql. The material here is too elementary. Also, too much time is spent on obscure and rarely used topics at the expense of the 'meat' or oracle."
2,"Pretty little book, but......","If you want a little book to place on a table in your guest room, buy this one. But if you want to really learn something about the subject of milagros as votive offerings, buy the book ""Milagros: Votive Offerings from the Americas"" by Martha Egan. It is very informative with excellent illustrations. It will make you want to be a collector."
3,not a must have,"This is a cute little picture book with a very superficial discussion of the actual objects. It has very little useful information, lots of hippie crap about love and symbols. Where do milagros come from? who makes them? what are their histories? how did they become symbols of whatever they are symbols of? what is their significance in Mexico? these are questions this book does not address. Also, the claim that there are instructions for making your own milagros is misleading. All the book tells you to do is get a picture from a magazine or maybe cut a shape out of paper and laminate it. I gave it three stars because if you only want a cute little book with a lot of pictures this one would do."
5,You don't know where you're going until you know where you've been.,"I really enjoyed this book. It opens with a prologue where John Barrett is found having a heart attack. He has not been healthy for years, addressing a stream of surgeries. Barrett dies as a result, which brings the family together. They haven't been close in years, each suffering their personal turmoil. It wasn't until the funeral when each of the sibling got a chance to seek about their father; they could see that he wanted them to be a family.The book is really centered around the life of journalist Ellen Barrett, but Kingsbury finds a way to journey and entwine the lives of her siblings: Jane, Amy, Megan, and Aaron. This story was a good reminder of the old saying, You don't know where you're going until you know where you've been. Grounded in good spirituality, this book is a must read."
4,Where yesterday lives,Book is good but not a fast read due to the subject matter. Love all of Karen's books. I have a full library of all her books.
2,Dull.,"Though this book does present a variety of different Star Wars collectables, the manner in which it does so is somewhat boring. Even as a huge Star Wars fan, I found the book hard to read, but it is still useful as a checklist."
4,finally a book that deals exclusively with Canadian stuff,"I think anyone interested in Canadian SW toys will find this book useful. Contains some great pictures and catalogue pages. What I liked most were the insights offered by Mac Irwin, the president of Kenner Canada during the vintage toy years.He makes it a little more clear why certain toys were packaged and released in the way that they were. This is a good addition to any collectors library of reference material."
1,DON'T BUY IT. BAD RETURN POLICY. CHEESY.,I bought one of these for my mother for a holiday gift. She had trouble seeing if the Alarm indicator was on. The prjection part would have a loose connection and turn off and then on. Plus it was $71.07 when I bought it. It was not shipped from Amazon as the page showed. It came out of some cheesy place called DynaDirect.com. 7 day return policy on a holiday item. Come on! Even my credit card company had trouble returning the item.I ended up eating the cost.
1,Don't Buy It!,After having this expensive little unit for only 1.5 years it lost its ability to receive AM radio signals. Customer Service only had one suggestion: Try the reset function listed in the manual. This did not fix the problem. The killer is that there is no service available!! Cannot be returned to Oregon Scientific and they do not provide names of anyone who could fix it. Suggested I purchase a new unit. Not in this lifetime!! Unit was not very user friendly and the customer service is the same.
1,Not User Friendly,"The small footprint of this clock fits nicely next to my bed and I like the fact it also projects the temperature too. However, I find this unit not user friendly. This is the first time I have had to literally read the instructions to see how to set the alarm and then it is difficult with several buttons to push while looking for the very small icon. Also to tune a radio station to a preset is tedious. If you press the snooze button to view the screen, it changes the projection mode out of time projection to alarm projection so the snooze button has to be pressed again to go back to the time projection. If it wasn't a gift, I would have returned it."
2,"This really is the romance genre, not fantasy","I bought this book because I am a fan of (most of) Tanith Lee's fantasies (an exception is her vampire series, which shares some of the same problems). I don't like romance as a genre, but was willing to stretch a point for the Lee story.But--Lee's story is really a romance despite a few fantasy trappings such as ghosts. Or perhaps reincarnations--I wasn't quite sure what was going on. It seems written for women who want relationships to entertain detailed fantasies of same. Complete with a mysterious, temperamental, dominant hero (he's a jerk) and lengthy kisses so ecstatic as to be absurd (it is just a kiss, after all).I read most of the third story, and realized it was just another romance in the same predictable mold. Even though I almost always finish books, I gave up on the rest of this one--I never read the first story.So, if you're primarily a romance reader, you'll probably like this book. If you're primarily a fantasy reader, probably not."
2,NO SUPPORT,"This was purchased thru Amazon. The first arrived with the wires outside the case. Amazon replaced it without any problem. Now the reset light and button does not work. I've spoken to Electrolux and they don't have any answers. They referred me to a local repair site. When I spoke with them, they said the item was probably made abroad and they will not fix it or know anything about it. I again called Electrolux and they gave me two other repairs sites. Both told me they don't repair. I'm stuck with a $500+ item that no one knows how to repair or will take responsibility for it."
3,Disappointing battery life,"I was really pleased about being able to replace my iPod's battery so easily, but after about ten months this battery started holding a charge for only a couple of hours use. I'm going to probably replace it with the same product but obviously I'm disappointed with my first experience with it."
1,"Wow, what a waste of time!","This is NOT a movie. It is a documentary. An extremely boring one. No actors, shaky camera, bad focusing (I know it might be for effect, but annoying at best), useless material, pointless interviews, and again, no plot (since it is a documentary). Boring, dumb, useless, waste, yawn, stupid, uninteresting, crap. The movie cover is the ONLY good thing about this pile of bs."
5,Wonderful Documentary,"I loved this film. I watched it one night on Netflix and it stuck with me all night and in the morning, I was still thinking about it. It's a really well made film, and if you haven't seen it, try not to spoil it for yourself because it's a really interesting watch. I finally got the DVD yesterday, but I haven't checked the Features out yet. I'm a sucker for commentary tracks though, so I'll probably check one of the two out today. It's a really fair price for the quality of film and features you're getting. I can't recommend this movie to people enough. If you're curious at all of underground horror, you have to check it out!"
1,Piece of crap,"I didn't know this was a documentary about horror film makers. OK, some nudity but, overall pretty boring. After 30 minutes, I couldn't take anymore. Don't waste your time or money on this unless you are an avid grade C or D horror movie watcher. If I could give a zero, I would."
1,Absolute trash.,"Investigative reporter looking into the S&M porno scene, and the not quite snuff films. Poorly done on all fronts, with little nudity to make it more interesting.It would have been better if they had actually made a movie about some reporter sneaking around investigating this stuff. Anyway, after viewing this boring trash, I threw the DVD into the garbage, and haven't once regretted doing so! Save your money, don't buy or rent this junk."
4,A rare gem.,"This is probably one of the best horror movie I've ever seen,shocking and very creative.Just sit back and go with the flow,you will be delighthed!"
2,Disk loading error....,"I was, and still am a Denon fan...just not for their DVD products. We have a Denon reciever that is fabulous so when I purchased the DVM-1815 I thought it would be flawless. However, after a year it experienced ""disk loading"" issues that would come up almost every time I used the player. After returning it for a new model, the same problems occured again and again.As in other reviews, the unit does cause small scratches on the disks and they often fall out of the tray. The tray, in my opinion, is very flimsy and poorly made. Denon products are typically the highest priced, therefore you have an expectation of buying a solid unit. Not the case here."
3,Informative but over-written,"Though the subject is an obscure one, even for the English, the usefulness of Uglow's research is compromised by the fulsomeness of her writing. She will apply four descriptive clauses to an engravng when one well chosen one would be enough to stimulate imaginative understanding. It is also distressing that Uglow arrives at virtually the same conclusions, draws the same moral messages, about whatever sets of engravings she discusses. Was the man so monotonous? Or is it the biographer?"
2,Have we left God behind like the unwanted child?,"God, unlike religious never intended to be left behind. That was the purpose of the Biblical scriptures written in each and every language. Unfortunately, man has, by virtue of ignoring the old God that once formed the faith of everyone, now requires a new face and image because he has become obsolete in these days of man emulating God. By not keeping the tenets that are the function of religion, man has ascended not to the right hand of God but above him, relegating God to the sidelines as if he was a benchwarmer, to be taken off and put in the game, momentarily, for our own use and privilege whenever we might need him, or use him for a convenient excuse. Like the children we torture and warehouse, in the name of morality and justice, God may well have left us to the fate that we have decided we prefer, the self help of leading other people around in the name of God, but without the authority to do so. Hail to the Chief!"
2,DVD is to accompany a Book/CD set with same name!,"Bought this for my nephew for Christmas. Have not looked at the dvd, but right on the cover it states that it is to accompany a book/cd set with the same name. That book/cd set is currently not in stock at amazon.com. If it states that it is to accompany a book/cd, I wish that would be stated in the product details! Frustrating! I will ask my nephew to write up a review if he decides to keep it without the accompanying book/cd."
5,Wild Box Set,The Wild Box Set is one that one of any age would love to see. It makes a great gift anytime of the year.
4,Unofficial Guide to Lego Mindstorms Robots,"After seeing the Lego Mindstorms robots on the Computer Chronicles TV show, I was quite interested. But this book pushed me over the top. It is a good introduction. But more important, it covers the alternatives to the RCX programming environment supplied by LEGO. The coverage of the C-like and Forth-like alternatives alone makes this book worth the money. Some web links appear out of date, but that is to be expected with a book 10 minutes old. No CD ROM, some good samples and some detailed construction examples. A good place to start getting serious about the RCX."
3,For an old version of MindStorms - RCX,"Hey.. this ibook was published in 1999, and is for the RCX version of mindstorms, which is way old.The walkthroughs and resources mentioned in the book are good though, and the price was right."
3,Bizarre,I stumbled upon this movie in the middle of the night and it ended up being pretty entertaining. It's really really strange but it's funny and interesting. It also made me cringe a number of times.
5,really funny,wow. never seen any thing like this. the tipe of movie that gets better the more you watch it.
2,Zero Artistic Merit,"Seems to be about this skinny idiotic turd glorifying himself and exagerrating his endeavors. I mean really, this man is so full of crapola it's amazing. First off he's so unattractive physically and emotionally he could barely get the most old and washed up whore. But in this movie he's in relationships with gorgeous ladies who he treats like dirt and they don't mind and come back for more abuse. He's stupid and shallow and as far as the movie, it's awful and dull and thoroughly unenjoyable. He takes a topic that could and should be fascinating and just turns out a horrible thing that's really quite remarkable in it's inane inability to stir up the faintest interest."
4,Great for transmissions!,"As another commenter mentioned, these pliers are a specialty tool, not designed for snap rings that have holes for pins to fit in. These were exactly what I needed to get the lock rings off the mainshaft of my transmission during a rebuild. I tried many times to make due with the more common pin style snap ring pliers, which didn't have enough surface area or strength to get the rings off. Tried to improvise w/ other tools, with limited success. Once I grabbed these, they came right off, and went back on quite easily.The right tool for the right job makes all the difference!"
5,just what I needed,these plyiers were just what I needed to get my transmission taken apart& put back together I would strongly recommend buying them if you're working on a 4l60e
3,"Okay, for the job","I bought this for the snap ring in my axle which worked the first time, but after i installed locking hubs, these were way to big to fit. I recommendChannellock 927 8-Inch Retaining Ring Plieror something like that which has a needle tip to fit in tight places. I mean, for the job, this one was not bad, and it wasnt expensive, but if you invest in a higher priced interchangable tip set, it will do this one's job, and many more.Not saying this Lisle tool is bad, its actually pretty good quality, but it has limited uses."
1,DRAFT 1,"I am a medical interpreter in a large hospital. I still consider this book to be in its draft form. There are spelling and grammar errors in both the Spanish and English. The format looks like it was type set with an ancient word processor. Before you purchase this manual check it out at your local bookstore, however if you still decide to purchase it do so on amazon.com so that you save enough money to buy a better one later."
5,Manual for Painless Medical Spanish,"I have used the book, ""Manual for Painless Medical Spanish"" by Ana Malinow Rajkovic for my classes this past semester and every person said they really liked the book. The book was used in a class rather than independent study and they all liked the text.Several factors contributed to this factor. They liked the print, the practice exercises, the answers for reinforcement and the size of the book. There is a manageable amount of work with a good variety. I would highly recommend the book and am using it again this fall.There are a few typing errors which could easily be corrected. It was a pleasure to use the book and would look forward to a sequence to this book along with a tape for reinforcement."
3,Amusing and Good for Beginners,"I had no experience in Spanish whatsoever, but I took a very intense medical spanish course that used this book as one of the supplemental texts. I found it to be helpful for the most part. There wasn't much in terms of grammar, but it was good for vocab. Also, some of the stories and exercises are hilarious. Our instructor found a few mistakes though in the text so be careful."
4,great product,"So far I'm only 1/3 of the way through but I already feel like I've learned a ton of medical spanish. It's very easy to go through on your own and the author's jokes and light-hearted tone keep you wanting to go through more. I definitely recommend this book if you're a medical student, doctor, nurse, etc. and in need of some basic-to-intermediate Spanish skills."
1,Painter's Handbook,"This book should be taken out of print. If you have worked as a professional painter for six months to a year you could write a better book than this. Horrible pictures and almost everything is completely out of date including estimating data, product information, and design and color recommendations. You would be better off buying an up to date book on running a general contracting business and asking a very knowledgable paint rep. on what products to use for specific situations."
4,Good System,This has strong pickup so you can sing a whisper and it's projected. Very comfortable on. The sound is okay perhaps because I'm channeling it through a portable unit. If I were to use it with a more professional set up I might achieve a richer quality.
1,DC Line Would Not Fit Into DC Outlet!,"Sennheiser ew152G2 ME3 Headset Microphone Wireless System, Channel AThe supplied DC connector would not go into the DC outlet on the back of the receiver so I could not even get this operational."
1,Disappointment,The Amazon description indicated the cable I was buying was a DATA cable but when I tried to download some photos from my camera I learn the cable I bought was a charging cable and the computer did not recognize it as a data cable.
2,Good starter bible,"The index is not comprehensive, the bible doesn't seem to be built for lasting purposes, but all in all, it is decent for a beginning bible. I bought this thinking it would be something my daughter would keep forever as a keepsake, but this is certainly not that kind of quality. It only has 1-2 maps in it, so it doesn't give a lot of information that way either.There are no side bars or special sections/reflections for kids...it is just a plain bible. I would have spent more money on a better bible had I known. All depends on what your purpose it."
1,"Not a stolen idea, but a stolen STORY.","""Fractured"" is not only a poorly executed film, it's poorly executed theft of a brilliant book, Will Christopher Baer's ""Kiss Me, Judas"" which pre-dates this film by almost ten years. Forget about the urban legend. 95% of the dialogue in Klosowski's film is taken verbatim from Baer's novel, as well as the storyline and order of scenes. This is a blatant case of theft.Yet in spite of stealing some brilliant source material, she managed to screw it up.Don't support this thieving hack. Read ""Kiss Me, Judas"" instead."
1,Plagiarism!,"This movie is actually a rip off of a novel written by Will Christopher Baer. Jut from the trailer, I could see plenty of imagery stolen directly from the book. Not vague similarities, but very specific details.Kiss Me, Judas is a beautiful novel. This movie looks to be a pathetic forgery.I look forward to hearing about some legal action."
1,"If you want to watch this, Steal it","The ""filmmaker,"" and I use that term very loosely, stole the idea for the movie, so why give them any of your hard earned cash?Looks like they got caught, though. Official site is down, and its no longer carried by the distributer.Guess she got what was coming to her. And i meant for the stealing, not the 2nd year film school quality of this excuse for a film."
5,Awesome thriller!,This movie is great! Intense with lots of twists. Awesome imagery and very artistic. I highly recommend this movie!!!!
5,Apo Hiking Society Is A Great Group,"If you haven't experienced this wonderful group with decades of hits and success, you've missed the boat...they're super!"
2,Of hand-rolled smokes and opera...,Not what I was hoping for in a sailing adventure narrative. I quickly tired of tabulating how many hand-rolled cigarettes the author smoked and how many varieties of music he enjoyed. I kept waiting for the essence of blue-water sailing to emerge in the form of vividly described sunsets and starlit skies. It was also surprising a person would take a boat with as many mechanical problems as the Warrior Queen out of swimming distance of the nearest port. By mid-way through the book the author was out of money and out of crew. This book is essentially a beginner's guide on how-not-to circumnavigate.
4,A fascinating read about a less-than-adept sailor,"A most interesting story, by a sailor who, at the inception, was certainly not ready for the sea. Nonetheless, his tales draws you in and as you see him attain a sense of seamanship, you are compelled to follow his exploits to a dramatic climax."
1,perfect stocking-stuffer for dogs who like to chew on books,"Why did this guy write this book? I don't have a clue. It is so bad and all i have to say is who cares about a little stinkin' boat floating around with a sick man in it. If you have an English teacher who tries to make you read it, don't, because it is an overly-descriptive heap of incessantly boring script with no dialogue and Beattie seems to have a desire to beat his women and drink to no end. If you would like to expose yourself to alcoholism and pornographic balloons in the most boring way imaginable, then read this book. No, don't read it."
5,A good book to snuggle up with.,"John Beattie should write another book. I presume it is his first attempt at a book and by the end he was really in his stride as a great writer.A bit more technical than a landlubber cares for at the beginning, hence the ""9"" rating. A very absorbing tale full of plenty of harrowing adventures. A sure ""10"" part way through the book. I just hope he has more sailing or other adventures to write about soon."
2,Disappointing Travelogue,"Quite simply, I was very disappointed in this book. I was hoping for a gripping tale of man against nature along the lines of Into Thin Air or The Perfect Storm, but this book proved to be more travelogue than compelling adventure. Though aspects of Beattie's solo trans-Atlantic voyage were indeed dramatic, Beattie lacks the necessary skill to make the events truly resonate with the reader. I felt like I was on Everest with Krakauer and in a great storm with Junger (who was not even there), yet here I read Beattie's adventures as a dispassionate observer. Perhaps even more disappointing was the fact that much of the writing seemed totally superfluous. I would have liked to learn a little bit more about the difficulties of solo sailing and a lot less about Beattie's fondness for drugs and alcohol and what he had for breakfast every morning. I certainly went into this book with high hopes, but finished it quite disappointed."
4,"ENTERTAINING, EDUCATING",THERE WERE PAGES WHEN YOU FEEL RIGHT NEXT TO THE WRITER. KEPT MY ATTENTION FROM BEGINNIG TO END.
4,"Interesting, fast reading, fastinating, well written.","The Breath of Angels: Author keeps anyone, even if you have never sailed or stepped on a boat very interested and explains everything so simply that you are into the story and his adventure rather than being bored with sailing or boating language. Funny at times. John Beattie has a lot of courage to finish his dream."
4,Voyeuristic Voyage,"This film made me feel more like a voyeur than a viewer. The acting and settings are unbelievably naturalistic. The viewer becomes the proverbial 'fly on the wall', and considering the look of this film, that's about right. I found myself oddly entertained beginning at Mr. Lazarescu's dank apartment to each of the subsequent hospital visits.Overall, considering that this is a Romanian film with grim subject matter that runs over 2 1/2 hours, it was pretty darned entertaining. Just be aware that 'Grey's Anatomy' this ain't."
2,"Long and tedious, although realistic","The movie tracks Mr. Lazarescu on his last night as he travels in and out of emergency rooms in search of assistance. The film is realistic, with rare moments of humor and also occasional poignant moments, but ultimately is tedious and almost painfully long. Yes, you catch a glimpse into a medical system where no one is really responsible for, nor really cares about, Mr. Lazarescu's life. The situation differs so much from the view we're weaned on, where doctors race to solve problems, that it is valuable to learn about. The editorial comment that one can visualize how ""suffocatingly slow time must seem"" for Mr. Lazarescu is absolutely correct, but only because time feels that ""suffocatingly slow"" for the viewer as well: I saw this movie in theatre and wished I could have gotten up from my seat (in the middle of the aisle) and walked out."
2,"Good acting, honest story, but it didn't go anywhere","PROS:This film was well-acted, raw and honest.I felt that it was a realistic portrayal of the health care system.CONS:It was identified as a black comedy, and I didn't see the humour.I felt like I was left hanging at the end - I wish we actually knew what happened."
5,A Dantesque odyssey,Great depiction of Universal Health (HELL) Care that so many politicians are currently advocating!!
1,ROMANIAN TORTURE.,SURELY YOU GOT SOMETHING BETTER TO DO THAN TO WATCH THIS MOVIE.I QUITTED AFTER 47 MIN.I DARE U IF U CAN TOP IT.
2,Beginner's book in programming.,"After buying a Palm organizer, I knew I had to develop an app for it. This book is not written in such a way to help even a beginner get off the ground. Although it talks about different environments and other software to use, there is no clear thought and organization. The author does stress on good programming design and development, but thats about it. I'm sort of diappointed in this title, especially since its an O'Reilly book. Skip this one and find another Palm programming book!"
2,"Don't bother -- the DOCS available at Palm, Inc. are better","I read the SDK documentation and the SDK Companion before Iever bought this book. I thought it would help clarify some of themore difficult points (as I come from a weak programming background.)But instead, I found that I already know MORE than this book teaches.Many of the examples are pseudo-code, worthless as real examples, andbarely helpful for the calls they make. The authors often gloss overthe more important points like common use, syntax, and definitions;telling the reader to read the SDK documents for THOSE things. Well,if I can read the SDK for everything important, than why do I need thebook? To summarize, it's not worth the money..."
1,a waste of money,"This book seems to be mostly an extract of the online documentation from palm, inc. But the downloadable documentation is much more complete, and it's in pdf-format, so it prints nicely on a laser printer.I wouldn't waste my money on this book (well, unfortunately I have, but that's another story)."
2,Thin on the database coverage,"I actually developed my Palm application in Java with the Palm CDK and JUMP2. As mentioned in earlier reviews, this book is directed to C/C++ programmers using either CodeWarrior and GCC. I also found the information on Palm databases to be pretty shallow. In most cases the examples were pretty shallow and certainly did not provide too much insight on how the records on the desktop are sync'ed to the handheld. Even less was covered on how you might pull content via a web service or xml/http to the desktop. Need an example of where this book falls short... How do I create a .pdb file on my desktop?"
3,Palm OS Programming The Developer's Guide,"The information was not as detailed in some areas as I had hoped. It would be a handy reference guide except! The pages are separating from the binder and I expect that in a few months I will have many lose pages stuffed in the book, Especially in areas I reference often. A good reference book should withstand repeated usage, and this one will not.This book was bought new in mid November and has had just one months useage."
1,Save your money. Avoid this book.,"This is the worst O'Reilly book that I have read.The documentation that you can download from Palm is far better.Disorganised and terribly incomplete, even if you read this book you will still need almost all the Palm online documentation.Do yourself and your wallet a favour...Dont buy this lemon."
1,Not up to the usual O'reilly standard,"O'Reilly once made good books. Yep, made the, the way a craftsman makes a fine tool or the way a structural engineer make a suspension bridge across the Niagara Falls.You know, nice solid things that you could read to find out the details of that obscure perl command or the way to get create a relational database using emacs.Now the rot has set in. I became suspicious when they released a VB book (ok, it was a pretty hardcore vb book and I actually bought it )Now they are doing what all the other "" con-the-suckers"" publishers are doing, ie producing a book with little or no substance. This must be the Pokemon of books, capitalising on the popularity of the Palm with no real content inside.Wake up O'Reilly ! Repent !"
4,Concise collection of information,This book provides a good concise collection of the basic information needed to develop a complete application including a custom conduit. You could download most of the same information from Palm but you would be left digging through vast amounts of dry documents to extract what you need. O'Reilly press has done what it does best and extracted the most useful information for you and put it together in an interesting format. It won't answer every question you have but it is a good place to start.
5,Great book for the beginner and the advanced,"...I've never written a Palm program before, but did with this book by my side. From the step by step installation of the tools necessary to create Palm apps to giving the source code for a fully functioning application the authors have created not only a how-to, but an excellent reference. Definitely a must have."
5,Very good book to make your 1st programs,"This book will teach you all the basics of PalmOS programming whether you use CodeWarrior or GCC + PilRC + GDB.You'll find a lot of small reusable programming examples that will help you to build your next application faster. For instance, you'll learn how to port a TCP/IP Unix application using Berkeley Sockets to PalmOS in 5 minutes !"
4,Fantastic Book,"I've read tons and tons of Palm programming books, and each one of them covers about 40% of what I wanted, but in depth. This is the only book to cover everything that I need in Palm programming, including programming the Conduit, and even Installing the Conduit!No Palm programmer should be without this book."
1,Disappointing,"I purchased this book, and after spending a night wading through it, I found myself to be disappointed. It's the first O'R book I've ever bought that I intend to return.The code fragments were all terribly out of context throughout the book. It was difficult to understand where things were supposed to fit together. Variable types were never discussed in detail, form controls that the authors considered 'simple and well documented' were never discussed in the book (never mind the fact that this was supposed to be documentation, eh?). There was no mention of how to pull up date controls like the Datebook does, or how to write HackMaster applets or so on. It was basically just not adaquate for my learning needs. I had a project planned, and the information in this book was not able to help me complete this project."
2,"Decent, but can't stand alone.","This is a decent overview of programming for the Palm OS platform. However, it's not a reference - for that you'll want to download the docs from Palm's devzone web site. And before reading this book, you might want to go through some of the ""Hello World"" tutorials found various places on the web. Given those things, I found the book a good source of examples and a few helpful tips (the gcc callback function issue would have caught me, for example). In general, this book could have been a lot better."
2,"Good on ""why"", but not ""what"" and ""how""","If you're new to Palm coding, this probably isn't the book for you. Long winded explanations of why things are done certain ways on the Palm *precede* any examples. The real content (how to make an application) doesn't begin until near the middle.Once you're at that point, typing in the examples (only the first example is available for download) reveals yet another oversight: they are not complete. The omissions include global variables, resource file descriptions, and more!I give it two stars, not one, because its descriptions of ""why"" are quite detailed. After I've studied through a better Palm introductory programming book, I'll likely reread the detailed descriptions to broaden my understanding.But for now, while I need to understand ""what"" and ""how"" more than ""why"", it's being shelved."
3,"Good book, but was hoping for more meat.","This is certainly a well-written book detailing the intricacies of programming the main parts of the PalmOS, but I was hoping to find more ""cool"" stuff here, like patching system traps and changing the device to use grayscale mode in pre-3.0 OS devices. I was also hoping for more detail on writing other kinds of applications than just your standard database-driven-with-a-conduit type of application, such as games. Nevertheless, I highly recommend the book for people who are interested in learning to program the Pilot, but experienced programmers can pretty much find the same information in the documentation that ships with the Pilot SDK."
1,A disappointment - particulary for an O'Reilly!,"Really not worth it, especially new. Despite O'Reilly's excellent reputation, this one volume is not particularly useful to either beginning Palm coders or experts. It discusses a number of possible programming languages and software, but all examples seem to be with their own specific setup, complete with their custom ""stationery"". (Yes, you can download it from their website.) The examples do not include many common tasks - like working with dates - and in some cases do not even function as written! Truly a disappointment."
3,Not Bad,"This book has a decent overview and will get you started. Some of the organization, material, and graphics are well thought out. I like that it covers CodeWarrior but also cygwin tools. It pulls a lot of material together that could otherwise take time to hunt for. Though, still, those with the SDK may find that is all you need and may not touch this book."
1,Don't Order from Caswell Massey!!!,"On December 27th 2005 I ordered some carnation soaps fromCaswell Massey. Three weeks later they wrote saying itwas out of stock and on back order. In April I wroteto request a refund and I have never gotten any responsefrom them. No refund, no soap, no letter.Buy your special soap from a company that CARES aboutcustomers."
5,Perfect Air Conditioner,"If you have windows that don't open up more than 12 inches look no further. This air conditioner fits where most don't, and that is a huge perk. I bought this air conditioner a few days ago and I am very happy with it. It cools my one bedroom apartment well and is very quiet. This is an energy star air conditioner which is nice. I love the remote control feature. The design is very sleek - most air conditioners are ugly in comparison. I also like that this air conditioner has an automatic five year warranty - parts and labor. Most air conditioners give you a one or two year manufacturers warranty if you're lucky. Just my two cents."
1,Too loud,"I wanted to love this air conditioner so much. The design and style are nothing less than amazing, right down to the expandable window frame folding nicely into the unit. Even built in handles!Unfortunately, it's just unacceptably loud. The compressor cycles off and on with a loud growl. In not sure if this unit is merely defective, but I suspect that the innovative design forced the company to compromise too much in other ways.If this unit was whisper quiet, it would have completely taken over the market by now.I'll be getting rid of it shortly."
2,An excellent product,"I am very happy with this product. The only reason that I did not give it a rating of five stars is because it is not REAL old-fashioned oil cloth.I would be surprised to find the real thing ever again. This product works just as well and it is generously cut, not at all skimpy."
3,ITALIAN,"Please, does anyone knows if the book ""Hemingway, in love and war"" has been traslated in italian?. Thank you very much, Massimo."
4,Awesome book,"I really enjoyed the book. It was very hard to put down. It took me back to when my fiance was in the Gulf war, and we had to do a lot of writing. When Agnes wrote about wishing he (Hemingway) was there with her and how she couldn't wait to be with him again....brought back a lot of memmories. Since I have read this book, and enjoyed it, I have to now buy ""Farewll to Arms"""
5,Psychologic proven!,"As a Dr. in Psychology, I can antherstand Hemingway and obvious Agnes. I suppose this romance was to beautiful to hold stand!. Anyway I antherstand 1961( Ernest did suicide WITH Agnes her letters next to him) AFTER 4 TRYING? to forget Agnes! MARRIAGE'S. This prover real eternity love exists, only both have to FORGIVE, and that's the hard way (I do know personnell). They were really made for each other, sad, so sad: stubborn Ernie and WHY?. Dr. Patrick Verheyen (U.S. Graduated ;-)."
3,I t works for Caono S5IS,I use this in my Canon S5IS camera. At he highest resolution I can take almost 1000 pictures. The pictures download slowly from my camera. I'm not sure if the problem is with the camera or card. It is only a minor problem for me.
4,Nothing like the fit of original equipment,"I've had my share of bad luck buying replacement blades at auto parts stores. The vendor's incentive is to have as few blades as possible ""fit"" as many different vehicles as possible. Too often, it's a mediocre compromise. For this reason, I've been going to the Ford dealer to buy replacement blades, and they fit perfectly. My one wish is that the rubber would last longer. Either the air or the weak New England sun degrades the rubber. My wipers certainly aren't used that much. By the way, Bonnell Ford's price is about $2 less than Amazon's."
5,Jazzercise is a great workout!,This exercise routine is my favorite of 4 Jazzercise tapes I have. It gets your heart pumping and works all muscles of the lower body well in the toning segment. Judi Sheppard Missett is fun to workout with and she always keeps it upbeat.
3,"Whodunit, hey?","Good plot with serious introspection on Bernsen's part. A little weak on the ""Christian angle"", but still a good flick. Canadian filmakers have come a long way since the MacKenzie Brothers sudsy camp films of another era. Bernsen's acting carries this film to a 3 1/2 star rating."
2,slow,The underlying concept of the movie is good -- but it moves so slow. There is a message if you can stay awake till the end.
5,Great viewing!,"I don't watch too many movies, but this was on tv one night when I was flipping through the channels. I watched the whole thing, and found myself refreshed and smiling when it ended! Nicely done! If possible, please go to the website for Rust and read up on the cast before you watch the movie. Learning more about them will cause you to enjoy it even more."
2,I was disappointed in this movie,"As a Christian I was expecting a movie to up hold the Lord. I was very sad to see this was not the case. Though it was okay in ways I was offended in some ways. 1. the ""minister"" felt it okay to use the ""H"" word when talking to another minister. A preacher in my eyes does not need to resort to cursing to make a point. The police officer used the slang word for the ""F"" word. I find slang offensive as well. And though God was mentioned... where was Christ? I did not hear of HIM being lifted up. Christian means Christ like and this movie was not Christ like to me. All the smoking from people talking of God.... sorry... did not like it on the whole."
3,Depressing,"I was hoping for an inspirational Christian movie. This movie was quite dark, depressing, and slow-moving. I feel bad discounting the efforts of all involved in this film. But I would highly recommend you spending your time watching the 4 films from Sherwood Pictures-those are truly life-changing. (Flywheel, Facing the Giants, Fireproof, Courageous)."
3,Corbin Bernson was the best part of the film,"The overall premise was good, but the story line and characters were not well developed. There was not enough development to enable the viewer to become involved with the story or the characters. Disappointed."
1,Rust,"Movie was too long and boring. The entire movie could have been done in 60 minutes. Corbin's preaching skills could have been better. Corbin's father in the movie did not like his son (Corbin), but they still communicated together. What's up with that? Increase the cast of characters. Corbin acting as, ""Mannix"" worked okay as to find out that the man was not guilty of burning down the house, but no real flare or excitement like the real ""Mannix"". I know this movie was not ""Mannix"". Anyway, too boring and way too long. You could leave the movie running for about 30 minutes while you are doing chores and come back to the movie and you would not miss nothing! It needs a better and more powerful script and a better director. Corbin (formerly from L.A. Law) is capable of doing much better! But, what happen? And so it goes!"
2,A slow moving movie...,"I bought this movie based on some of the reviews I read here, but I personally found the movie really slow going. The production was great either. The saving grace to the movie is just the last part of it when he discovered who burnt the house which killed the family."
1,Depressing,I would not recomend this movie... probibly the most depressing one I've seen. God must get all the glory not man!
1,Movie Review,"Watched the movie last night. Nice attempt at the message of redemption...but very slow moving, poor acting. Wish I hadn't bought it. Sorry."
3,Parental guidance required,"My science-loving eight-year-old son really enjoys reading books from the Magic School Bus series, and the topic and plot line of this one engaged him as well. But early into the book, he was asking me about nearly every other word. When I looked more carefully, I realized the reading level was higher than other books he had read in the series and many of the facts were things I had learned in junior high. I decided to take over, reading the book to him and explaining many of the topics in more detail. Don't get me wrong -- he really enjoyed the book and learned some ""cool"" new things about the senses. It just wouldn't have made much sense without my involvement."
3,Good science explanations but overwhelming for youngsters.,"The Magic School Bus brings another cute story into print this year with Exploring the Senses. The story is somewhat predictable - the bus shrinks and children pop in-and-out of various parts of the body. But the basic explanations of the senses is good. Children ages 8 and older will learn about hair cells, smell cells, taste cells and rods and cones. The topics are a bit broad and children may need to read it several times to understand the science concepts. No experiments are included (unless you have a magic bus!). However, children will learn that we have many sensory cells and that each of these cells sends nerve signals to the big decoder - the brain. (From The Science Spiders(TM) Newsletter)."
3,Extreme Power M0914 Portable Vacuum Cleaner,"Good quality and does well on hardwood floors. Unfortunately, the vacuum doesn't have a whole lot of suction for vacuuming dirt from the floorboards of cars. Hence the reason for 3 stars."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this to be able to vacuum the upholstery in my car. I have a dog and I sprinkle de-odorizing crystals on the seats and let them sit overnight. It would seem like an easy job to vacuum these up, but this vacuum has a hard time of it. The suction is better when the small nozzle is extended and set in place, but then the intake is so narrow that it's impractical to use on a larger area. The nozzle comes in handy for seams. Bottom line: not useful."
5,Eric Dolphy on board with Coltrane's classic quartet.,"Eric Dolphy's performances with Coltrane's quartet rank as some of his most powerful. Dolphy is featured on alto sax as well as flute, and it becomes obvious that Dolphy was getting into the sound that Coltrane was searching for at this time. While Dolphy's playing on the Village Vanguard sets along side Coltrane are strong, the selections from the European tour are transcendent."
4,Brings Back Memories,"I was checking my passport and my ticket to Neuschwanstein Castle fell out. I thought, hey why not save the ticket in a picture book of the castle. I have visited the Neuschwanstein Castle and Hohenschwangau Castle 4 times so I wanted to find just the right book for my keepsake. I spent some time browsing the options and end up ordering this book.After receiving it, I read it thoroughly and virtually enjoy the castle again. I didn't give it five stars because I would have enjoyed having more pictures of this stunning piece of architecture; I am a castle freak after all. My ticket is now carefully attached to the inside cover of the book."
4,"A good collection, but with a caveat","First of all, let me say that I enjoyed this CD a lot, and I'm glad to have it because I love anything that Doris Day sings. But it falls short of 5 stars for one reason.Some CDs have a note about the fact that the sound is not perfect because of the exigencies of copying old 78s or other such media. This CD suffers from the problem to a much greater extent than most. To mention one, on ""It Might as Well Be Spring"" the surface noise is loud enough to be a serious problem. Now, I understand that there are problems in anything where you have to start with 50+ year old material, and if you want to hear these recordings (which have otherwise never been released) you have to put up with this. But it should be noted that the problem exists, and you should be warned.Other than that, it's certainly a showpiece for that great Doris Day voice, accompanied by the Les Brown band that brought her into the public eye."
5,Lost Treasures found!,"The songs here are found treasures! Don't expect the quality of studio recordings of today, but you won't be disappointed with the music itself. A piece of musical history captured for today's listeners."
3,"Start with this book, then move on.","This is a great start-up book. It gives you a good understanding of what Perl/Tk does. It also touches on a lot of the functionality. I went from knowing that there was something called Perl/Tk to writing a nice little gui in two days. Try that with Java. The minuses are that this book just touches on a bunch of stuff I want to know a lot more about (ie. Frames, Toplevel widgets). It also needs many, many more examples. Use this book to get started and then use it with actual code examples for real programming."
3,Inconsistent and confusing in places,"While I'll give the Perl/Tk book a place on my bookshelf, I'm left wondering about the author's mastery of Perl/Tk and technical writing in general.There are too many places where her use of variables is not consistent from example to example. Similarly, some of the more interesting parts of the package (menus, for example) are brushed over without complete documentation. To wit: 'Adding a Cascade Menu' .. ""... assume we already created $menu_more"". Which left me wondering ""what does $menu_more LOOK like?! Similarly, 'Displaying a Cascading Menu' .. ""$menu->postcascade(index)"" .. nowhere is ""index"" explained. Is it an array slice, is it an index name, is it a hash key?!All in all, if you've never played with Perl/Tk before, get this book - it does deserve shelf space. If you're expecting a down and dirty reference and example manual to augment your existing Perl/Tk knowledge, print out the POD and test.pl scripts and save your money."
2,Needs work,"There's all sorts of great ideas presented in this book, but there's no coherent structure. I would have prefered a book that went through building a few small useful applications, rather than being introduced to widget after widget after widget. In order to get help writing a complete application, it's necessary to skip through multiple sections of the book.Also, the idea that all of the properties for a widget have to be provided in the body of a chapter is ridiculous. Make 'em look in the Appendix! That what it's for!This book is extremely frustrating and I do recommend the ""panther"" book or the Perl Cookbook.-Doc"
2,Dont Bother: get the panther book instead to learn perl/tk,"I started learning perl/tk from the panther book (O`Reilly's Advanced Perl Programming). While the panther gave me a fantastic start to perl/tk, I eagerly awaited the release of learning perl/tk. When I finally got it, what a disappointment!! It was way too basic and the shallow, repetative examples did not help at all. Okay, if I need to see what a grooved vs sunken label looks like, I go to the learning perl/tk book (but only cuz I already wasted my money buying it). But time and again, if I have a real perl/tk problem, I go back to the panther and extrapolate the answer from the clearly presented realworld perl/tk examples.O'Reilly defended itself on the perl/tk newgroup saying they were aiming for middle-of-the-road as opposed to too advanced, in my opinion they definitely missed middle-of-the-road and wrote learning perl/tk for the user with no imagination and no desire to create useful, realworld GUI's"
3,Beginner's book; lacks substantive Perl/Tk code,"This is a book for Tk beginners. It does not fully explore the intricacies of widgets nor the dynamic interactions between widgets and the user. The author frequently mentions (briefly) what can or will happen but neglects to include Perl/Tk code to typify a working solution. Rather than tackle substantive problems herself, annoyingly she puts that burden on the reader under the guise of ""Fun Things to Try"" at the end of some chapters! The book would benefit from the inclusion of working solutions to these ""fun"" problems. As it stands, the book lacks substantive Perl/Tk code, leading me to wonder: has she written an end-user Perl/Tk application or is she just regurgitating the documentation? ...."
1,too shallow to be useful,This book will NOT help you produce anything useful with Perl/Tk. It is too shallow and too dry. A big disappointment. The fact that it has reached the sales rank it has (around 5000 as of this writing) is a sign of the thirst for a good Perl/Tk reference in the market. Too bad O'reilly wasted this chance. Hopefully they will do a better job next time. But you be careful and don't waste _your_ money with this book.
2,Disappointed. Included module documentation is better.,"Sadly, I found Learning Perl/Tk fairly dissapointing from both the Perl and Tk side. The examples are trivial and I thought (for a beginner book) the descriptions were awful and there weren't enough code examples.The demo scripts and documentation included in the Tk module were a lot more instructive for me."
5,Very Easy to Follow,"Although I don't program in Perl, I bought this book because it was recommended as a reference for using TK with the Ruby language, since there is no good documentation for Ruby/TK. I found the book very easy to use, and was able to make some fairly complex GUI's pretty quickly. I use the book a lot, and highly recommend it."
2,Propper but simplistic,"When comparing to ""Efficient Tcl/Tk Programming"" for Tcl or ""Python and Tkinter Programming"" for Python, this book is very mediocre. Still it helped me to get into Perl/Tk, but it has the same smell as the Solaris books from Sun, where the authors don't know about the daily reality of the programmer or admin. Use it for a start, but then we should force O'Reilly to produce something like the above mentioned books."
2,"Good Summary of Features, Poor Examples","This book goes through the basic widgets thoroughly. It presents examples on how to use their options, how to use configure, etc. A decent reference. No mention of Tix, however.That said, this is not a tutorial on how to use perl/Tk. Examples are skimpy. For anyone who has read Kernighan & Ritchie's _The C Programming Language_ or (more to the point) Wall, Christiansen & Schwartz's _Programming Perl_ will be very frustrated at the complete absence of nontrivial examples. It would have been nice if the author had at least gone over some of the widget demo code distributed with perl/Tk, but she didn't.This book is definitely in the bottom half of O'Reilly's perl offerings. Wait for the second edition."
4,Good tutorial,"This is a solid tutorial that goes through the most important components in Tk and contains good illustrations. You won't become an expert (see that word ""Learning"" in the title?), and the writing is clear but not spectacular. Before getting this book I tried to read up on Tk on the web and spent many hours trying to get a simple text component to do my bidding. After having read this book, it took me an hour to get the entire app done. Don't repeat my mistake; get this book if you do Perl/Tk!"
3,A good introduction to Perl/Tk,"I have read the other reviews. I would like to add that what this book lacks in depth, it makes up for in breadth. I think it does a great job of discussing all aspects of the Perl/Tk GUI. It does not go into very much depth. I'm developing a app based on the associative array structure in Perl and wanted a GUI to make the data analysis transparent. This book gets you started putting together a GUI, but you quickly start searching for answers in other places!"
1,Useless without examples,"This book is little more than a reference guide. It contains virtually no examples and often doesn't even explain how to implement some of the methods it teaches you.Exactly how do you pack widgets into a frame? Chapter 12 is devoted to frames and yet it never once tells you how to pack items into one. I eventually had to look this up in a friend's copy of ""Advanced Perl Programming"" (Chapter 14)!What's more amazing is that the book, somewhat perversely, goes into a verbose description of the options for each widget you can create. Why not put this at the end of the book in a table? That's what appendices are for!By far the best way to learn is by example and on this front, the book fails miserably. What a complete waste of money."
2,Little to no help,"The Hello, World! program doesn't work as printed. The menu bars don't work as presented. While I don't doubt Ms. Walsh knows Perl/Tk, this book, even when accurate, is a scattershot surface look at Tk. O'Reilly is usually much better than this (as a matter of fact, I'm off to look at Advanced Perl, based on someone else's recommendation).I'm not sure who this book was aimed at, but I can't imagine anyone finding it terribly useful."
5,5 Stars!!,"Ever since my eyes fell on this deck I was drawn to it. I am of Eastern European heriatage and it appeals to me. The artwork is beautiful and makes for great readings. I am one who interprets the cards and the artwork, as well as the meaning, when reading the cards, and this deck is wonderful for doing just that. I also love the feeling I get when I'm reading these cards. I can't quite describe it, but it is special. Perhaps it is reconnecting with my family heriatage.I love this deck!"
5,A gorgeous deck for Tarot enthusiasts,Printed on good cardstock with a durable finish; these cards are beautifully illustrated and a pleasure to work with. The manual that comes with them is loaded with the context of Russian history and mythology from which this deck derives; however it is a little light on the raw symbolism/interpretation that typically comes with a Tarot deck. I advise you to already be familiar with the common interpretation(s) of the Rider-Waite deck if you do intend to purchase this lovely and artistic deck.
5,first and favorite deck,"This was the very first deck I bought when I first got into tarot over fifteen years ago. I researched book stores and metaphysical shops and looked through catalogs. I finally chose this one, and I've never been disappointed. The images are truly unique and colorful. Though small, the detailing in evident without being cluttered. While sitting up straight, I can see every nuance. The background is black but these cards always feel colorful and bright to me. It is really enjoyable to use them.The cards are a perfect size and printed on good quality cards. The first deck has lasted me a long time through many readings. This time, I have bought the set which includes the book, something I didn't know existed and didn't have with the first deck. It is very informative on the history, the style, the artist, as well as the cards themselves. A great deal and I'm pleased."
4,Back to the blues for Hammond,"Had to really dig the country blues trio here on John Hammond's release, ""In Your Arms Again."" After a departure into country, blues and roots rock on ""Ready for Love,"" Hammond gets into some backporch juking, and it's great to hear.""Jitterburg Swing"" and the cover of Ray Charles' ""I Got A Woman"" are well done and great to listen to. A cover of ""Evil (Is Going On)"" is pretty good, and John dips into various catalogs for tunes that he can uniquely interpret.I'll admit ""I'll Be Your Baby Tonight"" is kind of a clunker; I haven't really heard anyone do that song well, except maybe Robert Palmer and UB40 some years back. In any case, this is finely executed recording, and one I'll return to quite often."
4,Rebellious Jess,"Lately,Jess's parents are driving her crazy!They won't let her get her ears pierced and worst of all they won't let her attend a party at the Hangout.Even quiet Elizabeth is upset about that one.Soon,the girl's grandparents find them scheming to sneak out!!You won't believe the amount of things the twins get away with in this..you realize how spoilt they are!"
2,Disappointed,"While this video would be ideal for those people looking to make architectural molds, unfortunately the DVD doesn't offer much else in the technique of using latex to make other types of molds."
1,Not good,"The idea of this player is great, but after half a dozen times of gentle use, the screen quit working. So much for my son's Christmas present."
1,Fell apart right out the box,I took the vacuum out the box and undid the clips that hold the cover to the filter in place. One of the posts that the clips hold on to fell right off making it impossible to re-secure the cover. I didn't even get to switch it on!Not a great recommendation for American workmanship.
3,great till parts broke,"I loved the design and the strength. The metal part is solid and durable, the attachments are really low-end and cheap looking. After 3 times of use, the floor attachment broke. I tried to use it on small runner in our hall way (the rest of our house has hard wood floors)and it would not glide over it. When I tried to figure out why it was giving me such a hard time on carpet, I found out that the bottom of the floor attachment had gotten loose, 2 of the 3 springs had broken. I ended up returning the vacuum cleaner. really a pity cause I love the design."
4,Vacuum Performance Review,"This vacuum exceeded my expectations. It's very powerful and the filtration system works exceptionally well - no dust escapes the vacuum at all. My only reservation is I wish the dust bag was a little bigger, and I could have used one more extension wand to keep from bending over. In any case, I highly recommend this vacuum."
3,Non Fiction,"David J. Skal's The Monster Show manages to strike a balance. It is reasonably interesting and indepth, but it is not so dry that you are wondering about how that paint is doing in the bathroom. So, a bit of entertainment here in his reasonably broad coverage of the genre of horror entertainment and media."
4,Good Job,If you want to understand programming the Flash Communication Server and it's capabilities this is a good place to start.
2,Mediocre,"This is an extremely basic first aid kit. I purchased it as I was putting together an emergency kit for my house and needed a first aid kit to include. This was cheaper than a lot out there but when I received it it was really very rudimentary. I probably should have determined this from the product descriptions but it is even more basic than the description led me to believe. If you just need some band aids and compresses, bear in mind this is all you are getting."
2,This is not a Panasonic!!!!,"Some channels look good but after owning the Panasonic in the other room, This plasma is going in the basement soon!! I am sad to say I should have waited for the Panasonics to come down, as they did!:( Please investgate B4 Buying a Plasma!)"
1,21 months to dead,After 21 months the picture went out. No help from Toshiba and an estimate of 495 to fix. I'll never buy Toshiba again!
4,Cohen 's life story is eerily familiar to southern Jews.,Edward Cohen's work articulates for us what we could not put into words for ourselves. I was grateful to find this book. It speaks for many isolated southern Jews who need a voice to describe their history. This book served as a guide to me in sorting out the feelings of being a member of a minority group--a Jewish southerner.
3,It takes a loving family (you-all!),"Interesting insights abound in this wonderful book about growing up Jewish in Mississippi during the 50's and 60's. Mr.Cohen introduces us to his family, friends and surroundings in a way that kept me from putting the book down. I read it in two sittings on a rainy weekend in Rhode Island and I felt like I was on vacation in Mississippi."
3,not bad for the price,"You get what you pay for. They work, but not the best quality. It gets the job done but the trays wear out and warp over the course of a few treatments. Made my teeth white at least, with the nitebright stuff. Not bad, but not the best."
2,Ho-hum Cyrano,"I saw this Cyrano and have the CD and it has some awful music. Why take a classic and add tuneless music?The CD sits on my shelf unplayed. A mustfor the curious Broadway Seeker. All else, will be disapponted."
1,Kindle Edition Review Only!,"The paperback version of this book is a lovely book, and I would give it five stars! The content of the Kindle edition is less than half of the paperback edition! I don't understand why someone thought it wise to create an abridged version. BUY THE PAPERBACK!"
5,works great for wooden chest,My aunt brought home a cedar chest with one of the two small hinges broken so I place this long hinge on. The hinge is great for chests it is very sturdy and looks wonderful. If you need a new chest hinge I would recommend getting this.
4,great!,"If you just want to own the first episode of the first season and the last episode of the last season this is a great DVD for you. Otherwise if you have the money to invest in the entire 9 seasons of ELR, do it! I bought all 9 seasons plus this one and I thought this one was a bit redundant."
3,review of Series Finale of Everybody Loves Raymond,the only problem with this DVD is that it did not have closed captioning on it. my husband depends on it and since it's a newer video I assumed it would include that feature. I wish there was a way that Amazon could make this known before the purchase is made. Thanks!!!
3,Safe and Cosy Ending,"After 9 years of Barone mayhem the writers obviously decided on a nice safe and cosy ending to the show. It could be a trap to try and fill the last 40 minutes or so with the best of the best, so they chose a serene almost lame conclusion to the series. The obvious exception being Patty Heaton, who was allowed to shine in this series finale. Memories of a great show will not dim from this last episode, but I expected a little more than what they settled on."
5,Opencable thoroughly explained,"Although I have been reading a lot of documents related to OpenCable, I was looking forward to a comprising work, where all was coming together. That book is now available. The good structure and well managed balance between the bigger picture and the details makes this is a very interesting book for a wide audience in the North American cable community."
4,Small mancala,"I loved this game as a kid, and was more than happy to buy it for my 6-year-old son. We play this game almost every night. My only complaint is that the gems are nice, but the 6 holes are very small so once you get a few gems in there they don't fit well and tend to fall out. It's great for not losing the gems or for travel (as intended), but I'm looking for a larger wooden board to make play a little easier (or less frustrating when the gems pile up!)."
3,Solid but does not lay flat and missing bag,"The wood has a good grain and the board is solidly built but the hinge does not allow the board to lie completely flat, and the box said that a cloth bag was included to hold the stones but there was not a cloth bag in the box."
2,For Grandchildren?,"I believe my grandchildren quite like the game, but it wasn't a huge success: I liked the look of it but I don't think it was all that interesting for them."
1,No support for Mac OS X.,"If you're a Mac user, forget this one (and all Umac products). They don't intend to provide drivers for Mac OS X."
1,Don't expect support from Umax.,Will not work with XP despite downnloaded drivers and patches. Umax wants to sell new drivers but I'm not willing to risk more time and money on something that Umax should be supporting without cost. Trash day is Tuesdays here if you are pre-XP and looking for a deal on a scanner.
2,Umax 1220U Review,"I purchased this scanner April of 2000. The software included in the package was clunky and did not load properly unless each was done separeatly. The scanner is slow and there is no on/off switch for the lamp. You can unplug the power supply adapter when you are finished using it to save the lamp. If you do, the pc must be rebooted to use it again. The twain interface is NOT COMPATIBLE with Windows XP or Win 2000. The software will not work in those OS's. However Windows XP Pro can inititiate a native driver to scan all items as a photo file. I am looking for a better unit now that I have had such rotten (almost non-existent) support from UMAX on this item. Definitly Not Umax this time!"
1,umax products $ucks!,do not buy umax products... it is a total waste of money.most of the time the drivers and software provided by the company does not work with the operating system you are using. in order for it to work properly you must go to their web site and download a patch that supposed to fix the problem but instead the patch conflicts with other softeware such as camera software or even the operating system (one more thing the drivers and patches at their website are not free).I wrote to umax and they have never responded to any of the emails i have sent to them. I decided to call the support center and I was refered back to the website to download another patch. (very bad customer support)
3,Old scanner. Still going after all these years.,"I inherited this scanner from my father a few years ago when I was in college. At the time I had a Dell running Windows 98. Then I upgraded my system and am now running Windows XP Pro. The original driver didn't work, although XP had a generic driver that would let the scanner work with limited options.All I did was search for ""umax 1220u driver"" on Google and I was easily able to find sites offering the Umax driver that will work with Windows XP, for free.The scanner and the VistaMax software it comes with still work great! Sure it's not as fancy or small as newer scanners on the market but it does what I need it to do and it was extremely inexpensive. Free!"
4,Drivers for XP?,"I do not really understand the missing or scarcely obtainable driver for XP matter. I have just bought an old instance of this scanner, and XP supports it natively, there is no need the UMAX driver at all. I checked the properties of the native driver, it belongs to Microsoft and its creation date is on 2001. There is (Sane) support in Linux too. So far I'm content with the device, at least it was worth of buying for $12."
5,Highly recommended,Very nice book for everyone who is interested in the financial markets. Highly recommended. Rich and detailed content.
3,Buy this book but you are not done,"This an excellent book that presents how fund managers think in selecting companies to invest in.It is very easy to understand and written easy to follow format. And alotugh Peter Lynch is no longer around investing actively, it remains as a classic. However, in reality these methods take time to implement. Many times you would not have the advantage to find such companies. And there are other methods to make money that are based on more technical methods. Check out the books of Toby Crabel and Linda Raschke - they are hedge fund managers. Although their books are out of print you will see how they make money though showing you the patterns they use. IF you are lucky you may still their books on Ebay or Amazon somewhere."
4,Must Read,This was one of the first books I had read on investing and recommend it. It would be nice to know how he'd have done in the 2000-2002 and 2007-2009 bear markets.
5,An invaluable tool,"I have had Lynch's One Up On Wall Street for a while, but have only now gotten around to reading it. I am sure glad that I have. With many of the other investment books you are told a general how to, and then left with nothing. This isn't the case with Lynch, who takes the time to explain the benefit of the P/E, who takes the time to show you how to figure out the worth of a company, who takes the time to show you how to evaluate a company and understand it. With One Up On Wall Street I have an invaluable tool, one that will help the amateur learn how to assess the worth of a company and whether you should invest in it.With Lynch I have found a great book that explains investing in a general sense as well as a specific sense. I would whole heartedly recommend this book to anyone looking for investment help. Through One Up On Wall Street the amateur investor, and many a professional, could set themselves on a path towards making money in stocks. A definite recommend."
5,Use Common Sense to Invest!,"Mr. Lynch has shown us here how to invest (not trade) successfully, one can just use common sense. For example observe people in the malls: What store do they walk in most? Where are most of the crowd headed? Take note of the stores/businesses. Ask your wife/husband what their friends buy, where do they shop at? What products are they talking about at your husband/wife/children's work/party? These are all clues as to what business is selling more and will have a greater earnings for the upcoming year. Watch the competitors, who are they and are they selling more?Basically by applying all the basic observations in the daily life of a business and *networking* information from family/friends, once can spot the ""10-baggers"" (a company whos's stock price will be 10 times higher in the future.)It is written in a plain and non technical way for the general investor to understand what investing is all about. A very useful book.Thanks Steve."
1,Don't buy kindle version of this book!!!!,"It only has less than 5% of full paper version of book. The paper book is great, I would give five stars."
5,Fast Delivery and Good Quality,"Book arrived in a timely manner and happy with product. Although book does not seem brand new, at the price and for my personal use it is more than enough."
1,what a waste of time,"i hate that book. i stayed today all day at home to read it, and now i cant even stand looking at one more page. i bought that book to learn and understand investing and i had a note book and a pen in hand to write notes, but instead, it is like a biography kinda book with old stories and coulda, woulda and shoulda but no solid information to remember or take notes off. i hate that book , i hate it , i hate it."
1,no delivery,The book was not delivered. It is good that full refund was done but I wasted my time to wait for it.
3,"received after 1 month, according to the schedule","Cover page slightly worn-out. Pages color are yellish. But, apart of this, everything seems OK.in the website it announced I 'd have received the book on first Marc, more than 1 and half month!.But it arrives ""just2 after a month. I'd not expect such a long time for an international package."
4,Great if it's your first investment book,"I think this is a great book if you are just starting to read and learn about investments. I have a Finance education but I'm no investment expert, however I don't think I read anything new in this book that I didn't already knew. I understand this was written some time ago, but some of the examples in the book are ironically bad. Like, what a great company GM is and how it is a great long term investment...please. Again, I don't want this to look like a bad review, it's a great book for beginners, if you are not a beginner, you can save yourself some time and not read it."
4,learning,"It is always good to learn about investing, especially if you are new to it. This book was fairly easy to read for a novice like me."
5,This is a great book to read when you are interested in getting into the stock market!,"Peter Lynch is my favorite market gurus to study and he makes the whole thing far more of a common sense idea than I thought would be possible. I love his own stories about what he decided to invest in, like when he followed his teenage daughters around the mall to see where they liked to shop. Then, he researched their favorites.He makes it clear that not only can you choose good stocks too (just the way he did) but you will probably recognize everything he has considered investing in because these companies/products eventually became very big. For example: leggs, when they were first sold in supermarkets and diet coke when it first arrived on the scene and took the place of coffee in the morning for many people. His record stands for itself. Even people who have never been in the stock market still know about his mutual fund which is still considered to be one of the most successful mutual funds in history."
5,One Up On Wall Street,"I thought this book was fabulous. It was funny, informative and written in a style that made it hard to put the book down. I highly recommend it, especially to anyone new to investing."
4,One of the better written books about investments.....,"If you want to be the best, learn from the best. If you want to read an investment book, read one that is written by a succesful investor...and this guy is one of them. Peter Lynch is a guru in investing and this book tells the reader what stuff to look out for in different investments....... But if you want to know how to invest in technology stocks better, you will be wasting your money buying this book....but with so much stochastics in the tech industry...perhaps no one really knows how to too...?!"
5,Absolutely the best investment book in shelf!!,"I read this book over 10 years and it not only showed me the techniques to pick stock in investment market, also trained my mind to consider others. If you want to be a street smart, this one is for you!!"
4,"extremely good, a *tad* bit scared of numbers","I got this book partly to get an alternative take on investing; I usually read stuff about Buffett, and found that he and Lynch express largely the same ideas but in different ways. The book is sort of a guide to investing for the layman, with particular emphasis on what makes for a really superb growth stock that layman would probably notice before professionals. There are many examples, and Lynch is a good writer with disarming humility considering his accomplishments. My one complaint is that he generally avoids nitty-gritty discussions of numbers and how to evaluate whether they are good or bad; I think he figures laymen are scared of numbers, which by and large is true."
4,Put Peter Lynch's know-how to work for you!,"I was very impressed with this book - I initially bought it for my husband but after it arrived, I read the back cover and was engrossed.I expected this book to be written in a way that people outside of the financial/brokerage industry would find hard to understand - and let me tell you - nothing could be farther from the truth. Lynch writes in a way that explains complicated subject, such as examining balance sheets and calculating different valuation ratios better than some business textbooks that I've read. (I often found myself thinking, ""Oh, so THAT'S what Professor So-and-So meant when I couldn't understand that he/she was talking about!) He does in a way that teaches beginners-to-intermediates without condescension or derision. I found myself thinking that this guy could be anybody's neighbor that you would invite over for coffee.The book is an exemplary view of the inner workings of being a successful investor, with interesting stories as well."
5,Must Read.,"The author - Peter Lynch is one of the most successful portfolio managers/investors of all time. This well written, easy to read book, is like ""Investing in the stock market 101"".Lynch classifies companies as Slow Growers, Stalwarts, Fast Growers, Cyclicals, Asset Plays and Turn Arounds. He clearly defines each of them and their characteristics and then goes on to say how you should decide when to buy or sell them.This is a great book - my favourite. It is a great guide for any newbie."
3,"all are excellent, except one",What is the most important idea in this book is that common sense is very important in investment. Peter Lynch also listed some common mistakes that many investors made. But I feel this book is for long-term investors rather than technicial daytraders like me.The chapter about options/futures/sell short made me feel very frustrating. He said they should be outlawed! I really cannot agree with him! I have been trading futures for several years and found they are very good!! This is the reason I only give it 3 stars.
2,Too vague and too outdated.,"This book does not tell you HOW Lynch picked the winners he had. Lynch was a good manager, but remember that he started Magellan at a good time when the market was in the very beginning of its rise. Anyone with a basic understanding of investing could write most of what is in this book. There is no quantitative part at all. Most of the companies no longer exist as well. Also, a new intro does not cut it either. The market over the past 3-4 years, and even a little earlier, is a whole new market. The basics stay the same as far as the Quant work, but new companies (dot coms, techs) and emerging markets (Russia, Euro) are involved. Peter Lynch should take his current books outstanding and re-write them with a focus on the reality of today and not be affraid of scaring off the investor (reader) with technicals and math work. It may be tough for some, but all will learn in the end."
5,Great Read,This is a great read and really shows how investment opportunities are everywhere. I already have knowledge in investing and this book really helped me to figure out how to invest in the more riskier fast-growing companies. Thank you Peter Lynch.
5,One up on Wall Street,"Very practical and complete, full of common sense and very valuable advice on how to structure a good porfolio, what things to look for, what to avoid. What I liked the most are several very helpful tools on stock selecting. It fine tunes fundamental ideas on investing, explains how there is no substitute for thinking to do well in stocks and what an investor should expect. Thanks, Mr. Lynch, you wrote a great book, no wonder you sold over 1 million copies!"
5,Want to do it right - buy this book!,"I would have given this book ten stars, but it only goes up to five.I have ten years of investing experience and I learned alot from this book."
5,Lynch's techniques worked for me,"While I am not wealthy (yet) I did find much of what Mr. Lynch pointed out in his book ""One Up On Wall Street"" very helpful and the book itself is very informative. Lynch's approach of ""buy what you know"" is a very good idea and he gives pointers on ways to go about ensuring the company you want to buy shares in is a sound investment. Most of the stocks I own are in companies that I frequent regularly. I have done very well for myself thanks to this book and I highly recommend it as well as Mr Lynch's other book ""Beating The Street"". If you want to invest in the stock market, please read this book first. This is a keeper."
5,Start here to begin making money and stop making impulsive mistakes,"I've read a lot of books on investing. I started with ""The Intelligent Investor"" and thenCramer's ""Real Money"" and more when I really should have just started here. I probably would have gotten off the ground faster and made even more money. This is hands down the most comprehensive guide to investing I've ever read and the most accessible. This book has helped me reflect on mistakes I've made in the past and has helped me better prepare myself for those situations in the future.Lynch is an excellent teacher, you can tell he's striving to make sure you understand what's really going on and all without the pretentious wall street gibberish. Even if you've think you've got it all figured out, you'll probably learn something new here or at least find a new way to reflect upon previous decisions."
5,Loved it!,"The costume was a hit and I absolutely loved it! The only issue I had with it was that it was too long for me. I had to have 6"" taken off and I stand 5'2""."
2,Fun in a small package,The screen is too small--I have to use a magnifying glass when I play! Otherwise it's great.
2,Broke them in less than a month.,"I needed headphones I could take to the gym, but after having Sony Street Style headphones w/ volume control for a long time, I really wanted headphones with volume control. Well, the loss of sound quality was just barely noticeable in the Koss headphones, they were half the price, and they do have volume control. However, they hurt the backs of your ears after a while, and whatever you do, don't wear them at the gym. I was using a stationary bike, got a little sweat in them, and the left ear stopped working. Oh well...back to Sony for me."
4,they are good,"I do not like traditional style headphones and the plugin-style ones are too painful for my ears, so I decided to try these. They are very good, no complaints. It is hard for me to judge sound quality as some other reviewers do, these are the headphones for a person on the move, not at home, and while on the street you usually are not in a silent environment, which means external sounds provide some interference. So whoa cares about 20 kHz frequency bans? Also, the cord is quite long which I like."
2,"Oh, dear...........","This is the worst headphone I have ever bought.It's actually quite sad. The sound is great. Problem is - on your ears, the little 'phones stick <i>away</i> from your ears.So there is: - NO MUSIC THAT U HEAR - NO ISOLATION - LOTS OF AMBIENT NOISE - NOT HIGHLY EFFICIENTAll in all, great headphones that refuse to let u listen. QUITE ANNOYING. And I shelled out $10 for these. Oh, well........IF YOU HAVE A HUGE HEAD - the problem of the speakers jumpin away from your ears at an akward angle is non-existent. My sister uses these phones, and she loves em. If you're like me, and have an average-sized head, or have an average-to-small sized head without any hair hanging down, these probably won't fit on you very well."
2,"Good sound, but bad fit","I agree with some of the other reviews that the sound is actually very good in comparison to other in-ear headphones, but that's when I'm pushing them up to my ears with my fingers. I'm giving them 2 star's because I can't get them to stay in my ears. The ear pieces don't conform well enough to my ears to keep them in place."
1,This review is for the KSC-5 model...,"...the KSC-5 Earbud Stereophones buy Koss are of very poor design and quality. They do not fit on the ear properly enough to be comfortable and the sound is just horrendous. Using these headphones is comparable to listening to an AM radio and will make even the best sounding cd players sound terrible. There is no bass and the highs are sorely lacking. I suppose if it has any strengths at all it would be the midrange, but that is something that many cheap headphones do not really lack in the first place. Stay away from the KSC-5 headphones and spend a little more money for better headphones."
1,Uncomfortable and over-rated,"I bought these headphones largely on the strength of the reviews offered here. Unfortunately, the clips that hold these phones to your ears are not adjustable. One size does not fit all. I wore these for less than half an hour, and my ears are still sore 20 minutes after removing them. On the other hand, my wife wore them and found them quite comfortable.The sound quality is over-rated here, even when you consider the relatively low cost. The sound is thin and scratchy. They would be adequate for audio books and similar material, but I wouldn't enjoy listening to music with them."
2,hmm whats the purpose here,Well the things hug my ear well but the actual ear buds dont stick in your year. They might if you have holes in your ear the size of a quarter. So since they dont fit the sound quality isnt that good. its nice because im a mountain biker and they dont fall off but i would pass if i were you.
2,While I can't complain about the sound...,"Before I bought them, I thought they would fit snugly inside of my ear as others I have bought that were similar to this. The plugs are way too big and fit outside of the ear dangling. I can't seem to get them to fit correctly no matter how hard I try. Like i said the sound is good for a cheap headset, but I expect them to at least fit."
1,It is BAD!!!!,"One product I never will recommend to anybody is this one. Sure, a 4-foot cord is a nice little feature, but that only counts if the product works. This unit never worked. When I took it out and plugged it into my cd player, it only played out of one ear, and never fixed. Nothing really worked to tweak this thing back to normal, so DON'T BUY IT!!! IT IS JUST A WASTE OF MONEY!"
1,Waste of Money,"Don't believe the hype about neodymium magnets and good bass sound with these cheap headphones. I think the positive reviewers must have been hired by Koss, because these earbuds (or whatever they are) have NO BASS WHATSOEVER--I mean nothing! I compared them directly to a pair of Sony earbuds (not even the best ones), and while I'm not thrilled with Sony in general, the Sony earbuds blew Koss away in richness and bass, hands down. The Koss sound flat and hollow, like music over the telephone. I also bought the Koss UR-15 headphones at the same time, and they turned out to be garbage also. Do yourself a favor and buy another brand. Even if you have to pay more, at least you'll get something for your money."
4,Jaine Austen is awesome!,"If you are looking for light, fun, cozy mysteries, you've found one here. The main character is down-to-earth and endearing. Being able to hear her dialogue with herself is what really brings her to life. She has all the insecurities of every non-Barbie woman out there, and we're given an inside view of the things we all think but never say. I'll definitely continue reading this series."
5,Super funny and relatable main character,"I loved this book! The main character, Jaine was thoroughly real, loveable and sarcastic (which is my favorite type of humor). I've since gone and read the next 4 in the series. The best friend and eternally optimistic best friend, Kandi was the perfect foil. My one criticism would have to be Jaine's subservience and cow towing to that damn cat. I'm definitely not a cat person and the reign of terror portrayed in Levine's books only reinforces my utter disdain for the creatures."
3,Cute,"This is the first book in the Jaine Austen series. In this one, the main character is likable, and the story is pretty good. I did get tired, however, of the author's cute gimmick of having Jaine think one thing and then saying something else. She has her opinions but is so afraid of ever hurting anyone else's feelings that she always goes along with whatever they say or suggest. Including her cat. It was cute at first, but then I found myself just longing for her to stand up for herself or follow through on what she intends to do just once.Cute can carry a plot only so far."
5,Fun and quick read,"I really enjoyed this book. I was on vacation and read it in one day, and was sorry when it ended. I hope it's not too long before Ms. Levine graces us with another Jaine Austen mystery. It is a laugh out loud, fun book, and I like the fact that a person who is not really a detective, trying to solve a crime, seems like a person who is not really a detective. Mistakes and all! Read it and enjoy!"
4,Very cute and super fast read,"This was a very, very fast read for me and I like books I can get into and finish. The main character is one many can relate to and it was just a fun read. I have started the series and am up to the 3rd book and they are all very fast and fun. I'd recommend anyone who likes a ""cozy"" mystery with humor and a ""bumbling"" heroine to pick this one up!"
4,Great lazy Sunday read,"This book was a light, fun read. The characters were enjoyable and engaging enough to keep me entertained on a lazy Sunday."
4,Very Entertaining Series Debut!,"This delightfully funny cozy introduces us to Jaine Austin, a freelance writer in Los Angeles who specializes in writing things like resumes, personal ads, and brochures for plumbing companies. When Jaine is asked to write a love letter to sexy aerobics instructor Stacy Lawrence on behalf of geeky Howard Murdoch, she has no idea that Howard will end up being arrested for Stacy's murder. Jaine feels that Howard must be innocent, so she ensues on a hilarious search of trying to find the murderer herself.This book was laugh out loud funny. I can't wait to read the other stories in this series!"
5,laugh out loud enjoyment,I thoroughly enjoyed Laura Levine's first Jaine Austen mystery. The story kept me interested from the first sentence to the last. But it was Jaine Austen herself who made me want to continue reading. She is so very funny and easy to relate to. I can't wait to read the next one!
3,Fun but fluffy,"Parts of this book were enjoyable, but on the whole it wasn't. The solution was obvious to me fairly early in the book, so it was only the writing to keep me occupied. I almost couldn't go any further than the first 20 pages when the heroine's best friend's name was spelled two different ways in the same paragraph. I stuck it out & found many funny parts, but everything was way too predictable. The blurb says the author used to be a sitcom writer and you can kind of tell because everything was so well telegraphed, as a sitcom would have been.I thought the hook was great - a writer hired to write a love letter, but the writer wasn't fleshed out well, and the supporting characters weren't much more than props for the heroine. I did like that she wasn't perfect, that she worried about her body, and that she procrastinated. But I didn't really like the way she talked directly to the reader - usually at the end of chapter."
2,"Got the light to work, but not the pump.","I hooked the pump up and got the red light working, but the pump never did. There aren't any directions. I may not have hooked it up correctly, but if there is a trick, there should probably be some directions."
1,Irrational read,"I saw Mr. Shiller on CNN pumping this book and let me say the man is ""irrational"". He actually said bonds are a better investment than stocks. Let me see at around 6% a bond will only help my money keep up with inflation. History shows no better place for your money to be but in the stock market. I question any advice from a man who would only invest in bonds. He reminds me of most old school economists who have no understanding of the current market and can only rationalize it as a bubble. If you insist on reading this book may I also suggest balancing it out by reading ""The New Era of Wealth"" by Brian S. Wesbury."
4,A must read for anyone about to start stock investing,This is an excellent book and will be of interest both to the investor and lay-reader. Shiller clearly explains the reasons why such high valuations have become so readily acceptable to the investing public and how psychology and herd behaviour leads to bubble markets. This is a sobering book and should be required reading for anyone about to start investing in the current market - let the buyer beware...
4,Irrational Exuberance 2/E,"I studied and work as a physicist. This book is about economics, a mysterious and imprecise science. That said, I found the book very valuable in that it filled an emptyness in my education. It told me that the stock market is dependent upon a great number of variables and an important one is human behavior. Also it said or implied that an analytic approach to predicting stock market variables usually fails, disappointing isn't it. I recommend the book to amateurs as economics 101."
3,Difficult to Understand,"It seems as if Shiller, an Ivy league professor, is more interested in displaying his literary talent than writing cleary for the average reader. For example, beginning the third paragraph on page 144 under the topic, ""Overconfidence and Intuitive Judgement"", Shiller writes, ""Economists Nicholas Barberis, Andrei Schleifer, and Robert Vishny have developed the representativeness heuristic into a theory of investors' selective overconfidence and into a psychological theory of an expectational feedback loop."" What?! Many more places in this book are written just as abstractly. I'll admit that I am not an A+ English student, but if Shiller wants to get his point across he'll need to write his book for the average reader. The ""Bear Book"", by John Rothchild is more convincing and much easier to comprehend than Shiller's book."
2,Irrational Exuberance - a great disappointment,"I was excited to hear about this book and its analysis of today and yesterday's stock market bubble. However, the book offers nothing new. It hinges on the idea that history is bound to repeat itself. His examination of psychology compared to prior crashes is weak because he only concentrates on the smaller picture. His understanding of the techological advances in the last decade is is even worse. In one chapter he regards the internet as a future form of entertainment, nothing more. He makes no mention of the increasing role of women in the workplace, the drastic increase in mortality rates, etc.. etc.. etc..If you want to read a good book on speculation, by ""Devil Takes the Hindsmost."" By far, a much better book."
1,Too Long By About 286 Pages (The Book Is 296 Pages Long),"I found Professor Schiller's book painful in the extreme. Most of his conclusions could have been summarized in the first paragraph, or perhaps in a longer magazine article. While his views are based on solid academic research, which is hard to dispute, one could do without the pedantic history lesson and the constant pats on the back for clever questionaire solicitation. Too little attention is paid to the rise of Index Funds and the survivorship bias in the market indexes, as well as the irrationality of the day trader and the Internet market, which further feeds into the Index system. In addition, the section on investor psycology is cursory. One should read Cialdini's book on persuasion to get a better glimpse into what might really be going on in the markets today."
2,Too much of not much new for most of us...,"If you already appreciate that markets (especially stock markets) are prone to periodic ""speculatory bubbles"" whose primary cause is greed and herd-behavior, then you know most of what this book has to offer. Shiller presents lots and lots of possible causes, but since he can't demonstrate their relative, quantative effect, I see little point.There is no real investment advice save ""diversify."" There was an interesting appendix on using commodities as a diversification, but the conclusion is there are no really good ways at present.Perhaps the most interesting passage was where he described how people hearing his warning lecture just before the 2000 crash, some of whom agreed with him, went out and bought anyway! This brings home the extraordinary psychological power of these speculatory markets.I suppose that researchers or those in search of extreme data might find some interest here, but it seems much-too-much detail (to little avail) for most investors."
3,Excellent Book! A must read!,"This is an excellent book! It may seem dry at times with alot of statistics, but overall it provides a good insights into the field of behavioral finance."
3,Shiller is gassy.,"What I mean is, he's pretty full of hot air. We've heard most of what he's written before, from 20 other pundits. If anybody isn't already sick of the new paradigm - old paradigm debate then you will be by the time you finish this tome. For a much more entertaining view of the markets, and Wall Street in particular, check out Monkey Business: Swinging Through the Wall Street Jungle. Now there's a book that will really teach you something about exuberance."
2,not much food,"not much food in the book overall..a very shallow and general talk, but i found it interesting to see his comments (p220) on the interest rate and other potential risks in the mortgage market back in 2005. some of the points he mentioned are indeed drivers of the recent subprime meltdown"
3,Rational exuberance,This book does not quite work because the author gives us no algorithm to determine when the market is irrationally exuberant or merely going up.
2,iffy,dude is intellectually dishonest and an iffy teacher. but has some interesting things to say. could be worth your effort.
2,Far too speculative,"While I applaud Professor Shiller's attempt to move away from the basic idea that capital markets are efficient, I had a lot of trouble with his discussion of psychological reasons for market inefficiencies. The arguments may sound plausible to the uninformed reader, but I believe that most psychologists would find his arguments untenable. They are not based on strong evidence and they often are drawn from research on tasks which may or may not bear any resemblance to investing, e.g., jury decision making. I found this part of the book to be making far too many leaps of faith."
3,Bubbles and crises,"Last year in my country you could see some commercials in the TV inviting to invest in Mutual Funds, and I believe lots of people turned to that. The problem is that the very next year, beginning in January, the housing bubble burst and we know the rest of the story. Although this book was written before that, the book remain valid at explaining the particular behavior of the markets in these moments of furor, the ""irrational exuberance"", and the panic that follows it. In my opinion the book is a good investigation of the markets, you can see the author analyzing all the factors involved, including sociological and psicological (this make the book a little slow). Is good to invest in the financial system, but in awareness of its possible behavior."
5,Flashpoint Season Four,"This is a great Canadian import that gives a different view to the typical police show. It changes every week, making it more interesting to watch. Looking forward to Season Five."
1,Where is the rest of the episodes???????,"I'm not very happy this is a true disppoint because I love the show.Amazon should include ""ONLY 13 Episodes"" in the description!! WHERE ARE ALL THE EPISODES????? Love the show but very disappointed 11 episodes are not included! Flashpoint will end with season 5. The question is will it be packaged as the true season 5. Even my season 3 is messed up and part of season 3 is on my season 4. What is the deal. I think someone should be fixing the problem!!!!!"
5,Flashpoint IV,"I love this series and am really miffed that it was taken off CBS. Yeah, it is on ION, but it airs at 11 PM and I don't stay up that late.As for the product I bought, there are two episodes that go blank near the end so I don't get to see the finish. Unfortunately, by the time I was able to watch the DVD's it was too late to complain. So -- the series is a great series but my copy is missing two endings.5 stars for the series2.5 stars for the product."
4,Postive Show,I like the idea here is when you are in need of help they come and deal with the situation.
4,great tv show,"this is a great show and episode, well they all are. ive seen every episode there is, just waiting for more"
5,"Run, Jaime, Run","Flashpoint one of my all-time favorite shows and this episode is no exception, This episode was thrilling from beginning to end the cast seems genuine and I love that they always work together. 5 star episode"
5,EXCEPTIONAL Television Viewing,You will LOVE this show. If you love Criminal Minds you will really love this. Buy them all and then write everyone you can and tell them NOT to cancel this show! It's just plain awesome.
2,Flashpoint The Fourth Season,"I was disappointed with this product because it did not set out the entire season 4 episodes as per IMDB website. There were episodes from Season 3 (as distributed here in Australia)and only the first few from what was classified as season four, so basically I wasted my money buying it. Unfortunately there is no longer an Australian distributor for Flashpoint."
1,NOT THE FULL SEASON,so I ordered this a few months ago and I was all excited to finally be able to watch it and I discover it only has 13 episodes!! So angry right now and I feel so ripped off. Amazon needs to include this in the description of the product. I want my money back.
1,Amazon vs. Netflix,"I absolutely love flash point, watched the first three and half of season four on Netflix. That is when, Netflix runs out. Found these newer ones here on Amazon and I thought by buying them I would be able to download and watch when I am not connected - I can't for the life of me figure that out here. I tried watching this episode in an area without 4g, 3g is a little sketchy - complete failure, tried for a half an hour or so with reload after reload. Went to Netflix and have watched a few different shows now. I just spent another half an hour looking for a way to download this episode here on Amazon and have failed miserably. What the heck?"
1,"Love Flashpoint, Angry with Amazon","Flashpoint deserves 5 stars but, in this event, Amazon deserves 1 -- only because I can't give a lower score. After buying DVDs of all 4 seasons, I realized that the reviews are correct. Eleven episodes from season 4 are missing from the season four DVD. I purchased the DVDs and have now spent more money to purchase the instant video so I can watch the missing episodes. Very unfair of Amazon to not mention the missing episodes in the description of the product. Also amazing that half a season is priced the same as a full season. Amazon is usually very reliable and dependable but this is poor business practices and, in my opinion, unethical."
1,Ripped Off and Furious!!,"Amazon should refund EVERY customer that bought this Season set every penny they spent on it. It actually has 6 episodes from Season 3 on it and only 7 from Season 4! What the hell?! It doesn't matter if ION TV took over the show half way through, Amazon should have labeled this Season 4 Part 1 or said how many episodes were ACTUALLY Season 4! Myself and a large amount of other customers are furious about this and feel that we have been ripped off and misled. This needs to be rectified NOW!"
3,question,I thougth that Season 4 would have all the episodes. Are the last 5 episodes of the season going to be released?
2,Not all season 4,"Great show, but this set also includes 6 episodes from season 3 and only 7 episodes from season 4. Be aware when buying that you are not recieving all of season 4. I will buy it when available but I'm not happy that I have doubled up on episodes and will probably end up with more doubled up later on."
4,Very Nice,"I hang this on to the handlebars of my bakfiets and the kids and I can both share teh water, it is an indispensable tool for preventing our family from becoming dehydrated during our outings this summer."
2,no straps,"Maybe it is my bad for not reading the spec carefully. But anyway, this thing does not come with straps. So if you need to buy straps separately if you plan to use it while you ride your bike."
4,Great product!,I ordered this product to help me drink more water while I was on bedrest during my maternity disability. It work perfect. The only issue I had was getting the bottle open. I think the suction created from drinking out of it makes it tricky to open.
3,"Like title, book is half-baked","Although this book has some very interesting insights into Taiwan's culture, it was a disappointment. Too many words are devoted to the author's whining about not understanding or fitting in to the culture. For example, the traffic is not the complete chaos as described. The traffic laws and signals are used as loose guidelines that lead to an elaborate ballet-like movement of cars, motorbikes, scooters and pedestrians.Another problem is that the book is a series of vignettes, some of which survive on their own, some of which just mystify the reader (a set of diary excerpts about some fashion show is one example) because they are not placed in any context. Alas, there are few books describing Taiwan from an American viewpoint. Yet, with the high price for a slim paperback, I would only give this book a half-hearted endorsement."
5,AWESOME!!!!,"I have a 90 pound german shepherd and he LOVES these!!! I've been using these forever because they're not tough on the dogs teeth like normal plastic frisbies, they fly very smoothly and far, and they last a long time!"
3,A Little TOO Soft,"Bought this locally. Amazon has a better price, but I wanted to pick the color. Got this for our 6-month-old Terv, who seems to be high drive. Tervs are strong chewers, but I was willing to trade off durability for reduced risk of injury as she learned to catch. The pup loves to catch this thing, but I plan to graduate her to the adult Kong diskKong Flyer Dog Toy, Large, Red. Two issues resulting from the softness: the disk developed a tear on the edge within an hour of use, either from being repeatedly folded or chewed between returns, and the disk is too floppy (and small) to fly all that well. If you are convinced that you need the extra soft material, then go ahead with this. Otherwise, go for one of the adult versions."
1,ok,"My dog is only a 20# Daschund and within just a few times of using this frisbee it was ripped in half. I wasn't happy with the quality, as I thought it would have held up better than that."
2,Dog chewed pieces off in first few minutes.,I wished this product was more sturdy. My dog chewed pieces off of it within of few minutes of playing with it.
4,Helps alot!,This product helps give my hair a thicker look and I am please with it Certainly will purchase it again
3,not really worth the money,Not sure what this shampoo really does for your hair. It also does not smell very great. would not purchase again.
4,This helps my thinning hair.,"Good volumizing shampoo. Now only if it adds hair growing ingredients to it, then it would be perfect."
1,Disappointing to say the least.,"These screen protectors are very poor, which I consider a huge disappointment coming from Palm. Here are my observations:1. The sheets are VERY stiff, making it almost impossible to apply without bubbles.2. Any pealing of the sheet while applying it (to remove bubbles, for example) will result in a cloudy residue under the sheet.3. Pressing bubble out from under the sheet with the included card leaves cloudy ""tracks"" along the path.Overall, this product is horrible. I switched to Fellows and although they're not perfect, they are nowhere near as poor as this one."
1,Not very good,Brighthand website did a screen protector comparison and this product didn't even make it. How good can it be.
1,It didn't work on our computer system,We didn't realize that this program wouldn't work on newer versions of Windows. So it doesn't work on our system. I'm sure that was my fault not the sellers. It must have been listed on the description. But we can't use it.
2,Have you read,"Band of Brothers? D-Day June 6, 1944? Eisenhower? If you have don't bother with this book. Toss in a little ""Saving Private Ryan"" (his real name was Fritz Niland). Not much here that is original. On the other hand, you can read this, which is very good, by the way, & skip a lot of Stephen Ambrose books on World War II. That's why it only gets two Stars. Orginal Ambrose books get four or five. Lots of books on WW II to read so there's no good reason to read the same stuff twice."
2,"Nice, but a re-run, ""Ambrose Digest""","Stephen Ambrose is a great author and historian, but I am annoyed with this book. From page 183 on, this book is a near exact copy of _Citizen Soliders_. Citizen Soldiers covers the fighting from after D-Day to V-E day, focusing on the enlisted and NCO's. In _Victors_ from about page 180 to the end, the text seems to be lifted verbatim from that excellent book. I haven't read all his D-Day and Eisenhower books, but I imagine that the first section borrows heavily from that. The bottom line is that this is a nice book, but if you've read his other books, it's not new. Think of this as Ambrose's ""Greatest Hits"" and you have the idea. Still, on it's own, it's a good book, especially for the budding historian."
5,Makes the human drama of WWll come painfully alive,"Steven Ambrose brings the battles back to life with his usual human touches. No detail seems to escape him. No small piece of history was left on the battlefield. It seems that you are there in body and soul during the invasions. It makes you proud to be an an American, and humble to be born during the greatest of wars."
4,"Well-written, but mostly excerpts from DDay and CtnSoldiers.","Ambrose is excellent, but I was annoyed when I listened to the audio version and realized I'd heard most of this already, except for the first side of the first cassette. The hardcopy may be different, but if it parallels the audio version, you'll get much of the same info in Citizen Soldiers and DDay."
2,Sort of a best of Stephen Ambrose,"I have read most of the books by Ambrose and the material in The Victors is covered better in his other works. It isn;t bad, but the only reader who might find it interesting is someone who was looking to get into Ambrose's WWII works. Anyone else but the completists will probably not enjoy this book."
4,"Very good book, well written","Being an avid reader, everything that Mr. Ambrose puts out I read. This book does reflect other writings, but is still worth reading and provides much enjoyment."
4,A good recap.,"I got this book yesterday and began reading it before I realized that this book is an amalgam of Ambrose's earlier work. The content of The Victors is drawn from Pegasus Bridge, Band of Brothers and Eisenhower. Don't get me wrong, this is terrific writing, but if these older titles are already on your bookshelf you may want to think twice about buying this one. Otherwise, I think this book is a fine addition my library."
1,A rehash of previous Ambrose books,If you own or have read Citizen Soldiers and D-Day by StephenAmbrose you do not need to read this book. It contains pages andentire chapters lifted right out of those two books ... I felt duped and unsatisfied.
1,"Same song, different verse","The recent interest in remembering the brave people who endured WWII is worthwhile and honorable. Stephen Ambrose makes a very valuable contribution to that effort with his work. I have read other books by Ambrose on this subject, and others. If the reader has not read other books by this author, then it should be read with a great deal of attention and interest. If, on the other hand, the reader has read other books, such as ""Band of Brothers,"" then don't bother with this one. It is the same, verbatim, through large sections. Frankly, I am surprised the publishing company would allow the same book to be repackaged and sold under a different title. However, my disappointment in this book will not discourage me from trying other Ambrose works. I am looking forward to reading ""Pegasus Bridge,"" and others."
5,Best book written on D-Day to the surrender of the Germans.,"I am a 14 year old homeschooler, who read this book because I enjoy history. This book puts the works of the author, Stephen Ambrose, together. I found it had some great information on the Allied forces and what they had to go through in order to win the war. It made me respect the veterans of WWII and I hope every one who reads this book has the same results."
3,"A good ""Americans in WWII-Europe"" primer","As a late-baby-boomer American living temporarily in Europe, I was looking for something that could provide some background on WWII and the land where I am currently living. Since reading this book, I have an entirely new perspective on my daily commute to and from my work. I also have a renewed respect and admiration for those of my grandparents' generation, and I am thankful that their grandchildren didn't have to make the same sacrifices. Mr. Ambrose's thorough research provides a great and personal account of American involvement in World War II.Unfortunately, the book reads as a compilation (which it is) and suffers somewhat from a lack of central theme. This is somewhat annoying and makes the book more of an academic read than something more accessible to the everyman. Also, I found several obvious grammar errors in the text that hint of a ""get the 'script to the printer, quick"" job."
2,If you've read the other Ambrose WWII books skip this one,"I am not that familiar with Ambrose's WW II books (I have read Undaunted Courage)but this book came recommended from a big fan of his and I decicded to check it out. What I found was a fairly straight forward oral history of the D-Day invasion and eventual victory in Europe. It is made clear that this book is a synthesis of many of the author's previous works and I found myself thinking what purpose did this book actually serve if the ground has already been covered in prior books. I came to the conclusion that this was a WWII primer and if you found interest here you might want to go back and check out Ambrose's more detailed accounts of this time period. Aside from the Eisenhower apologies, this was an easy read but lacked depth. Ambrose makes his admiration and respect for these men clear and that makes perfect sense. But this particular book just seems unnecessary."
2,Self plagerism,"If you've read Ambrose's other books (Citizen Soldier, Band of Brothers, Pegasus Bridge for instance) you won't find a single new idea here. If you havn't read the others, shelve this one and get one of them. Why eat snacks when real food is avialable. If you're in the mood for snacks, go ahead and read it, its not actually bad, just tired."
4,"A great product, but takes some skill to put on","I have had The Boom for several months now and I find that it provides excellent sound consistently. Many times I am speaking through it in the car and people have no idea that I am talking to them on a cell phone. The earpiece goes into the ear canal and helps to mask out noises, making it far easier to hear conversations.That's the great news. The not so great news is that the hook over the ear gets out of adjustment very easily and is hard to get just right when you first get the product. It tends to sag if you don't have it adjusted properly, leaving the mike way down somewhere away from your mouth. The soft plastic piece (ear gel) that goes into your ear pops off the boom seemingly of its own will. I wish that it would stay on a little more firmly.While the adjustment factors and the ear gel are constant annoyances, I would not trade this product in for any other at this time. The sound quality makes it worth it every time."
3,Good film - poor video transfer,"i always wanted to own a copy of Seijun Suzuki's Taisho Trilogy of which this is the first film. As I don't understand most Japanese language I have to watch a subtitled film a few times to get the full experience. I had to watch Ziguenerweisen several times to get the story straight. But I was ""technically disappointed"" because the video transfer is poor. I would not buy the rest of the trilogy from this series. I recently bought Yumeji, the third film of the trilogy, from another source and the video transfer was much superior to this offering."
2,Cautionary Note,"I purchased this book hoping that the references to it containing the 1659 census of County Mayo was true (I had read that the 1659 census for County Mayo no longer existed). I found out that the book does not contain the 1659 census. It says it doesn't in the introduction. Therefore, the description of the book on this site as well as others I've seen, is inaccurate and misleading.What this book does have are synopsises of several families that lived in County Mayo in the 17th century and before (1 page long generally) and some basic instructions on how to proceed with your genealogical research.It's not a bad book but I think there are good, free resources on the internet as well as a few paid subscription sites that would be more useful to a person researching County Mayo, where few resources survive before 1901."
3,Some Interesting Information,My wife has roots in County Mayo and so I hoped that this book would help her in her genealogy research. Although the book has some interesting information it does not pertain to her particular relatives. The book does cover some early County Mayo material and will be retained in our library.
5,Review by a nutritionally-oriented physician,"Dr. Katz has done both the medical community and patients a great service by writing Nutrition in Clinical Practice. This book offers the layperson a surprisingly readable, painstakingly detailed overview of the role nutrition plays in health and disease. Anyone interested in knowing why good diet is so important should read this book.For the physician or nutritionist, this book is an essential tool for incorporating the latest research into your nutritional interventions. For students, Dr. Katz's work will be a highlight of their curriculum."
1,Misleading Advertising,"This item is packaged so as to mislead the purchaser. The cover indicates that the features are Sherlock Holmes movies. Since I am a collector of Sherlock Holmes Movies starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, I leapt at the opportunity to get titles that I did not have. When I got the DVD, I found to my surprise that of the 4 movies on the DVD, only 1 was Sherlock homes and I already had that one in my collection. I was hoping that I was going to receive 3 new movies so I dismissed that I already had one of the movies, which, by the way, was the only Sherlock Holmes feature on the disc."
3,Good little nothing to do today movies,"I liked these movies. The quality of the film at times wasn't that great, but these movies are good to settle down with when you're doing handwork and there's nothing else on TV. Great service from amazon."
3,2-3 good movies and 1 really old one :-),"I found that on each of these DVDs there is one movie that is not so good, but that is just my taste. For the price, three out of four film noir are excellent. An excellent buy for mystery buffs who like the black and white classics."
4,change is possible,"several years ago while sitting in a friend's kitchen, the radio turned to a new age music program, music i don't particularly like, a selection by charles lloyd played, and i was disappointed to hear charles lloyd fallen on hard times away from the jazz i first heard him play with forest flower.there were too many accolades for me to ignore this cd, and all i heard was more of that droning new age music and not the charles lloyd i remembered from forest flower.since i own the cd i have from time to time put it on the carousel. slowly i began to appreciate the music, by listening to the music and not hearing the music charles lloyd used to play. granted, all along i liked what he did with a couple of my favorite songs: ne me quitte pas and come sunday, and now they fit well within the other songs. and geri allen is at her best here.not one of my top ten cds, but one i've come to like."
2,Pseudo sophistication,"2 1/2While I commend Lloyd for staying relatively fresh all this time,. JTC is a spotty release lacking some depth in favor of extended wind-ups-and-downs."
5,If You Love Charles Lloyd - See Him Live,"I had the honor of seeing Charles Lloyd at Scullers in Boston recently as he opened his world tour. He was magnificent. In addition to doing material from this magnificent album, he added ""Sombrero Sam"" and ""Forest Flower, Sunrise, Sunset"" to the second set. Geri Allen was amazing and to watch Charles beam as she soloed on ""Forest Flower"" was a delight.The tour is on www.charleslloyd.com along with a full discography. Don't miss it!"
3,Great if you live in a big city,"If you don't live in a big city, this book is a lot of paper you'll never use. Doesn't mean this book is worthless; it's a fun read, whether or not you have the opportunities to do some of the things."
2,Dissapointing,"Contains technical information for splicing some of the company's products, but poor instruction for the novice. Technical language and terms that are not defined are used. Illustrations are not always clear. Several basic splices are not included. No information is provided on the final strength of the illustrated splices for the types of ropes listed. Might be OK for an experienced splicer who needs specific information on a specific product by this manufacturer, but not for someone interested in learning general splicing techniques."
4,Don't Try This At Home! Recommended,"""Man vs Wild"" is almost always enjoyable and safe for the whole family to watch, but this episode is a bit on the extreme side. Bear is dropped above the Arctic Circle (not alone like ""Survivor Man"", but the camera crew stays out of the way) and, as usual, he demonstrates survival skills to endure the elements.While I won't give away any of the action, this episode is not for those with a weak stomach. We also see a lot more of Bear than I ever wanted to see (the ""naughty bits"" are blurred out). Also as usual, I wouldn't want my kids to emulate some of the riskier stunts.Still, this is an entertaining episode that was fun to watch! Recommended!CFH"
5,'Arf! Arf! Blitzkrieg Sampler' (Arf Arf) Various Artists,"Thirty-two track various artists CD of 28 different obscure garage and psych bands. In more cases than I at first realized - bands on this various artists title have at least one full album out. Personally, I loved the chosen song for this Arf! Arf! label sampler from Rising Storm, The Bourbons (playing a Nightcrawlers cover), Lazy Smoke, Three Wylde Maniacs, the oddly-named Tommy Tucker & The Esquires, The Paupers (sort of reminded me of the Standells) and the awesome garage rocking gem by Powered By Love. Plus, I also should mention TNT - performing a Moving Sidewalks gem, the two heavy psych cuts by Pandora (not to be confused with the '80's all-female band, The Pandoras) and The Moving Parts - as the disc closes with four songs from the Space Negros. Essential."
2,OK for young teenagers,"This collection of poems and short stories was a super quick and easy read which would be ok for young teenagers. The writing in this collection is more sophisticated, however spare, and much more thought provoking than Serros' latest book, ""How To Be A Chicana Role Model"", which was just plain boring and predictable. Although this was a slim and light read, I would probably recommend it for teenagers going through the difficult identity years."
1,Bra experience,"FreshpairClassic Fuller Frames all over lace banded underwire bra 38H (label 38FF)/BlackI believed they knew what they were selling as for size..NOPE, just a waste of my time and money to ship it back. I will never order online again because I'm not paying for shipping it back anymore..so I just won't order in the first place. They get my money and I get nothing. I will buy locally."
4,"a fine mini-series,but suffers from being a bridge between the third and fourth novel","i give this fine mini-series 4 stars because this one was used to set up the rest of the series but for reasons unknown they stoped after this one.philip kent is now an old man(and now played by martin millner)and his son's are now the focus of the series. randolph mantooth is quite good as the oldest son who must do things for himself.his trek west with wife and new child is the focus of the first part and we get to see how hard the way really was and leaves us with very powerful images of the life and death daily life of our andercesters. the second part follows kent's two grandchildren as they fight for their part of the american dream. very well done,and i hope to see the other books turned into mini-series someday."
2,Disappointed - Lack of Originality,"I ordered this book for some ideas to keep the kids entertained over the long summer days. I was sorely disappointed when I found suggestions that ranged from ""Let your kids ride on your shoulders"" to ""Spot them climbing their first tree"" to ""Take your children to see Fourth of July fireworks."". Many of the suggestions are holiday or season specific. I found no NEW ideas for some quality parent-child time."
3,"Essential for the Cosby fan, but dont buy this 1st.","I own a lot of Cosby. This is fine material, but it is nowhere the genius of some of his other work. Before you buy this, buy Wonderfulness or Revenge or To My Brother Russel Whom I slept With or Why is there Air or Himself or Fat Albert. Nothing on the CD really stands out."
2,Not his best but still okay,"I listened to this as soon as I got it. I am a huge Cosby fan, but this is a much weaker CD than Wonderfulness, Revenge, and To My Brother Russell... It is still worth having for the completist though. There are better albums out there not in print anymore; ""My Father Confused Me..."" for instance."
2,"Oh, hurry up!","Bag Of Bones has to be the only book by King that I did not enjoy reading. The book is not scary! It's too much a romance book. After I got through half of Bag Of Bones, I kept telling myself ""Oh, hurry up and finish this book so you can move on to something more interesting!"""
4,Stephen is one of the best storytellers I've encountered.,"Bag of Bones is one of those stories where you get so caught up in it that you almost feel a part of the story. Another Stephen King twister. I love the fact that you can't figure out the ending to his stories. In this book, as others, he makes reference to characters from his other stories. You feel as if you know these people. Bag gets a slower start to the meat of the story, but it's a good ghost story."
5,Impressed with King's style.,"I've read just about everything Stephen King has written, and I can't say they all have left me feeling impressed. This book, however, did impress me. Unlike some of his other books, I was completely drawn into character during the first half of the book, and totally enthralled during the second half. I enjoyed it eminencely, and I appreciated his way of pulling me in to a point where the story became a vivid picture."
4,LOVE STORY WITH A STEPHEN KING TWIST,This book grabs you and keeps you the whole way through.No need to wait for the good parts. One of those that makes you want to read one more page just to see what happens next.
5,Stephen King: writing like it should be!,"If not Stephen King, then who else? What other writer could pull off a 500 page book that is a page turner from beginning to end? Bag of Bones was truly excellent. When King writes, he leaves no loose ends and always tells an enchanting story. Bravo to my favorite author!"
4,It was good because of its contents. Two thumbs up!,"I liked how each person had their own frame of mind,none on of them was alike."
2,Not up to par,"This book was not up to Stephen King's usual greatness. It was disappointing. If you're looking for King's usual horror genre, forget this one. Try one of his earlier works (Carrie, 'Salem's Lot, etc.). You'll enjoy it much more. Sorry Stephen!"
4,Another gripping story from Stephen King,"As usual, Stephen King has written a book that you can't put down once you've started it and the ending is far more coherent than some of his other books. As usual, there are some very disturbing scenes that I almost have to gloss over to be able to deal with. I was very much caught up in the book. The only reason for 4 stars rather than 5 was that there were a few passages, in my opinion, that dragged and where I actually found myself skimming and jumping ahead. Other than that, a very satisfying Stephen King experience."
2,Help !,"I'm on the verge of putting this book down and closing it for good. But I believe that you should never leave a book unread once you started reading it. If you quit, you will never know what you missed ahead and this is very unfair to the writer. So will someone please give me ONE REASON to continue reading this book? I'm in the middle of it. I'm finding it BORING. Every night I fall asleep before I make it to the second page. Which means I have been reading this book for about 300 days. Thanks. stenella@hotmail.com"
2,A Depressing Mess,"King can't figure out where he wants to go with his characters and plot. The whole taste of the book changes too often to be a fun read. This was not a book that I 'couldn't put down'. I put it down often. I cared about the main characters, but the story strayed from them too often. I hated the ending, in the same way I hated 'City of Angels'. I found myself reading it just to finish it, and by the time the major shift in the story took place, I was just reading the first lines of the paragraphs so that I could be done with it.I'm sorry I wasted my time on this one. If you want a good King book, read The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon instead."
1,cheezy,"Come read another one of Hollywood-cheezy-movie wannabe. Come experience all the flat characters, the unfocused scenes, and the sparce plot. Come! You just can't get enough of this."
1,Truly dismal...............,"While admittedly I have not read any of King's recent works, I was a strong fan of his earlier works (e.g. The Stand, The Dead Zone, Firestarter). Like the others I had read, I had hoped that Bag of Bones would be a compelling read from the very beginning. Unfortunately, it was not. After completing the first 125 pages of Bag of Bones, I stopped. I was truly disappointed and decided to cut my losses. Perhaps it would have improved, but with so many other books to potentially enjoy, I could find no compelling reason to read the rest."
5,thank you,i ordered this book and recieved two days later. i have read this book 3 times and i absolutely love it!!!!!
2,bag of bones--stephen king,"I've read many King books that I thought were excellent, but Bag of Bones was boring to say the least. Having one character dominate the entire book was a good effort on his part, but it had me climbing the walls waiting for something terrible to happen. Thoughts and scary dreams--which the scary dreams were few--wasn't what I was in the mood for from a Stephen King book. I guess you could call it interesting reading from certain individuals. If he's going to write horror than do it and not fool his fans with experiments. During the third part of the book, nothing at all happened to encourage me to read any further. I expect murder and mayhem at least--it dosen't have to be constant--just give us a little taste at the beginning so we have someting to look forward to. He's been writing a long time and I know the urge to stray to new horizons is tempting if not irresistible. Stephen King writes horror and that's what I want."
1,Probably his worst ever.,"I love Stephen King. I read everything he writes and while I can't rate them all five stars I truly have enjoyed each of his novels to date. What a shock to read Bag of Bones. I kept closing the book and looking at the cover... Is this an Ann Rice novel? It started like King but unlike his other novels I was reading 3 to 5 pages a day instead of 50 to 100. It was becoming an effort. And then it got worse. Let's spend time developing characters, twisting them & then kill them off. Save your money. Don't buy this book."
1,.......please...someone...make...it...end............,"Why do people buy King's books? I own three of them, and learned my lesson after the second. King writes for $$$ only and his characters are flat, very 1-D, and flaky. Plus, King seems to have some mental problem. He writes about sex as if it were something that people talk about over dinner. Well, KING, it is not. He is not a good writer....so why is he so popular?"
1,boring,This book takes to long to get into. It's good if you like long first person narratives. The middle was good but the beginning and ends were so so.
1,As the screw tightens and other horror tales,"If you think this hunk of badly written junk is something, then you haven't read the tales of the great Southern writer of horror, T.N. His wonderful trip into the unknown called Splattered Raw, was a great novel turned into a feature film, about death, love and chopped off hands and feet. Now that is horror, not one more King creation, brooding over a bat, or a house that needs to be dusted and swept. Get the real master of horror, T.N. and let him create a great movie and get King outta here. VIVA LE PUBLIC ACCESS!"
2,Let Down,"Having just finished the novel, I realize that my investment of time has returned too little too late. As I plowed through, I began to think the great reviews may be attributed to the many King deciples out there who simply worship anything with his name on it. Nothing in the story engaged me on any level, as other King tales have over the years. No suspense, fear, insight into the human condition, that the earlier King classics are kown for. The attempt was made by both the author and this old King fan, but it never clicked."
2,Disappointing.,"I usually enjoy reading King, with this book I just keep waiting for the end. This book goes on forever and says nothing. There are moments of brilliance but it's painful to get to them. The characters are not very well developed, I've read almost the entire book and can't say I know any of them or want to. I think if the ""romance"" between Mike and Mattie had been left out, I could have had more respect for them both . Mike dosen't act like a man of forty, but a boy of fourteen! I don't think the book is ""Bad"", but I do wish I had missed this one. Anne and Steven please have mercy and bring the magic back."
3,Bag of Bones could have been so much more.,"Bag of Bones started out as a totally beautiful and wonderful story. It lost lots from the moment Mike and Kyra were at the carnival and never recovered. This book could easily have been the best book by King ever, even better than Carrie. But, alas, the story took a disasterously wrong turn. Still, it is better than most modern fiction. Read it, but don't take a day of work to do it."
2,Bag of Bore,"I love Stephen King. I have been reading him since he wrote Carrie back in the '70's. Lately, I find his books to be getting somewhat boring and hackish.After the overly ambitious and self-indulgent tomes, Desperation and The Regulators; I was hoping for something better.The book starts with a bang and then whimpers along. Towards the end the book fizzles out like a old sparkler. The scariest thing King can come up with is a mean old rich man, a vengeful ghost and a town who seems to share a collective consciousness. When the big revelation is that most people in the town named their kids with names beginning ""K"", I wonder; what has King come too?He's done much scarier ghost stories (The Shining), more scarier little towns with a dark secret (It, 'Salem's Lot, etc.) and books that had more menace in their margins than a page of this book.King needs a vacation."
3,"Not his best novel ever, but the best in some time.","For about the first half, I was under the spell that Stephen King cast in his new book, _Bag of Bones_. It was wonderful, enthralling, etc., etc., what so few of his recent books have been. I had great hopes for the book, which I'd seen described as ""his best novel ever.""Do I agree with that evaluation? No. See _The Shining_ for the book that we will remember Mr. King for. _Bag of Bones_ falls apart around the midpoint, as do so many of his novels (for me, the magic started to disappear around the time of _Pet Sematary_, but I continue to read, and hope, that it will someday return). Will my comments persuade or dissuade you from reading the book? Unlikely. Still, I was hoping for more. Keep working, Mr. King."
3,What a great start...but,"5 stars for the first 500 pages. Kings most romantic writing. DH Lawrence like. But after the protagonist has his epiphany by beating his writers block the story turns an intelligent voice into an 'R' rated Scooby Doo cartoon with rediculas characters and beat you over the head gory, violent ghost scenes/dreams/visions? I don't mind the fun, trashy stuff, but it is too bad that Mr. King didn't continue with the subtlness and mystery instead of explaining everything. I am reluctant to critisize Stephen King's books, because I understand them and because I respect what he does, so no hard feelings. Oh, and by the way, what a great first 500."
2,It's just me,"I haven't read that many books by Stephen King, although in general I do like his books. The reason why I read this book, Bag of Bones, was purely coincidental. I stayed the holidays at my parents house and forgot to bring a book. Horror beyond imagination. So I started reading the dutch translation of Bag of Bones which is Vel over Been by the way. The book didn't do it for me. I wasn't horrified and the story didn't really appeal to me. It was not like the horror I felt in IT or the involvement I got with The Talisman To briefly sketch the story: It's about Jack Noonan a popular writer who after his wife dies starts getting nightmares about his summerhouse 'Sara Laughs'. As he has nothing better to do he decides after four years to go back to 'Sara Laughs' and finds himself getting terrorized by the house and the hostile village people. Sometimes a book is well written but just doesn't do it for me. Thats what I had with Bag of Bones."
3,Not His Best Effort . . .,"Don't get me wrong. I read it from cover to cover but, unlike some of his earlier work ('Salem's Lot, The Shining or Firestarter), or even later work (Under the Dome, anyone?), I found this ghost tale a bit all over the place: sex, racism, writer's block, evil old people, flashbacks, etc."
4,Great storytelling!,"I've been reading Stephen King books since I was a teenager in the late 70's. He was my favorite author until his ""It"", ""Tommyknockers"" & ""Needful Things"" phase. Then it was kind of hit or miss whether I liked his books or not.""Bag of Bones"" is one of the best books Mr King has written in a long time! Great storytelling and character developement. The characters and setting really come to life, making me feel as if I was right there with them. This wasn't one of those ""can't put it down"" books but rather one of those books you kind of linger over and carry around with you like an old friend. It's the perfect book to take with you on vacation! Enjoy!!!"
2,Horrible!,"I usually can't put a Stephen King book down, this one I hard a hard time picking it back up. It was so boring! The whole first 1/2 of this book, could have been condensed into 1 small Chapter! He really drug it out - I hope this doesn't indicate a change in writing style, because if his next one is this boring I won't force myself through the whole thing, which is what I had to do with ""Bag of Bones"". I'm really disappointed, and I've always been a King fan."
2,Like fishing with barbless hooks,"As happy as I was to see a new title emerge from the mind of the master, I felt cheated at the end.Though Stephen King can bait his situations with his careful turn-of-phrase, I felt like every time I went for the hook, I got caught, pulled in the boat, laughed at, and tossed back in the lake untouched. After I turned page #400 I knew I had to stay in the woods until the last ghost was flushed out, even though I wanted to leave.Lots of great tricks in this book...I think maybe I'm outgrowing ghost stories. Or maybe they just have to be less 'commercial.'"
3,Dull.,"I was very excited about reading this book and looked forward to checking it out. Finally, King had released a book that reader's were raving about.I think the first 100 pages ruined it for me. If I had to do it all over again, I'd tear out them and read it from there. They were incredibly dull and seemed to ramble. I kept waiting for it to get more exciting.The middle of the book was decent, but the ending was a bit of let down. I didn't think the main character did anything heroic other than follow all the ghosts' advice. Boring and muddled.I've read all of King's books and I hope he doesn't write another one that I found was very put-downable."
2,Bag of Bones??? Where's the Meat???,"Well, well, well...long awaited & much hoopla over a novel that fell a little short of my expectations.....Ghost story???whoo hooo.....magnets moved by unseen fingers....chilling...oh so frightening......some early 20th century racism & violence mixed in with a lukewarm love story....come on folks, expect more from the ""former"" Master of the Macabre. Stephen, Stephen, Stephen.....you need to get out more. Try another geographic location for your next novel would ya???Sorry, but this latest attempt just didn't have enough meat to dig my teeth into. Better luck next time S.K."
4,Quickly Becoming One of My Favorite SK Books!,"I am currently reading Stephen King's latest: Bag of Bones. It is a well-written, heart-felt read. Highly recommended for those who prefer a slightly deeper book."
2,Not his best,"This book while not unreadable certainly wasn't very original. All of the ""secrets"" could be guessed about 200 pages before revelation. And what was all the gratuitous sex for? One vivid description of a wet dream after another - I was ready to gag. If this is the author's attempt at a love story, I'd like him to stick to simple horror, please."
5,Brilliant,"I bought Bag of Bones in June of 99 and was not able to put it down. It's not your typical ghost story, it combines a variety of different plots which come together in the end. From an avid King reader, I think this is one of his best."
3,Bag of Bones: problem with disbelief and only for adults 18+,"My second Stephen King book. I liked Eyes of the Dragon a lot more. Bag of Bones is definitely for adults and can be very disgusting at times, especially toward the end. Worst of all, I found it difficult to suspend my disbelief at times, because the character simply doesn't behave as I would expect a normal person to. This happened a few times throughout the book. Otherwise, this was an ok book to read and sort of worth the time to read it."
2,Too drawn out,"It really feels like he's been pulling his recent works off a conveyor belt somewhere -- no originality, felt like a cookie-cutter work, storyline had possibility but was drowned in the endless, superficial wordiness. I rushed out to get the hard cover, went to hear King read from the book (got a signed copy, too!), and unfortunately, that was the most exciting part of the ""Bag of Bones"" experience. The book itself certainly wasn't..."
2,Too slow moving and redundant for Mr. King.,I found this one to be much too slow moving for Stephen King. Seemed as though he dragged it out to achieve the maximum amount of pages to justify the price this time!
2,The King just writing another book...,"Now, i know there are enough reviews already in this database but i though that i might just as well add my little commentary. Here is it: It's 700 pages in the paperback. I KNOW that Kings takes time to get going... but he does not get going after 100, after 300 but only after 500... and that's just a bit too long. There are however some very good moments in this book. It really got to me when Mattie dies. However i don't think that his racial commentary adds anything new to what's out there already. He can do much better and will, i'm sure... fingers crossed. I still like Stephen King a lot, don't get me wrong here! He's one of my favorite authors."
3,Good but showed some of King's own issues,"I will not lie, I was totally inot this book. It's Stephen Kind. I jkust love his style of writing, not matter what all my professors say. however, this book gave me these wierd hits of King's own personal mid-life crisis. I mena, come on, the main character was attracted to Mattie because of her age and that's sick. But I felt King was constantly trying to explain his attraction away.To be honest, it was making me sick. I'd never think king would display such a base mentality. Mattie was totally sexualized and I don't think King meant it. And that little threesome thing he had going was unneccesary!I was glad when she was killed off! And that's terrible. but she was damn annoying.Other than that, it was a good story."
2,Certainly not one of King's better books!,"This book caught me hook, line, and sinker at first. I had my nose in it every night! I was terribly disappointed when the plot began to weaken toward the end with the whole Mattie/Kyra scene, though. King brought in so many characters that the story became a web of confusion. I would find myself having to go back and re-read what I had already read just to keep track of the story line. I ended the book with a ""That was IT?"" attitude. Let's get back to the old Stephen King writing style."
2,"It's not my Favorite, but it's certainly not his worst.","I've been a King fan since I started highschool and convinced my overprotective mother that I was old enough to read his novels, and in that time the only Stephen King Novel that disapointed me was Bag of Bones. Now, don't get me wrong it's not that I don't like it, and I'm not one of those King fans that think his only good stuff is his trademark horror. I just felt that this one left something out. I often felt annoyed at King's work because they were so engrossing I'd spend the $25 on the book and finish it in a few days, even The Stand (unabridged, obviously) The problem with Bag of Bones was there just didn't seem to be that hypnotic effect that kept me up until 6am reading. It was very well written and an excellent novel, but it took me more than a month to finish it. If you want to be completely engrosed in a King novel read Dark Tower IV. If you just want a good story that you can read at a nice relaxed pace, get Bag of Bones."
2,"A very, very slow start, with a good ending","I would like echo the view of a previous reviewer that the first 100 pages could have and should have been torn out. It has to be the dullest thing Stephen King has ever written, punctuated with enough sex to make me wonder if the author is going through a midlife crisis. The last 20% of the book was a fairly good ghost story, but the first 80% drags so much that it was hard to engender much excitement."
2,Where's the Gunslinger?,"After reading Insomnia, I wondered if Steven King had become too powerful a writer to use an editor. After all, King himself says he has elephantitis of the mouth. I am glad to see he has gone with an editor for this one. Still, long and dreary with too little action and too much rumination. I sincerely wish he would stick with The Gunslinger series as it is the best he is currently writing."
4,S-P-O-O-K-Y! It Blew me away!,"This is the first Stephen King book I have read and actually finished. His characters were just so amazing, and they seemed so real. This book was full of suprises and lots of scares! I am in the 8th grade and I finished the 30 chapter book in 11 days. Now that I have read my first Stephen King book I would like to continue reading more of his books. For anyone who would enjoy reading a thrilling novel I suggest you check out Stephen King's ""Bag of Bones"". It's a story that will stick to you and you will definitely enjoy."
5,Superb! Of course nothing less expected from the King!,One of my favorites from Mr King! When I started this novel of course I couldn't read it fast enough. This story just draws you in and you can't turn back. Expect a couple of sleepless nights.
4,Slowly but surely grabs you and makes you believe in ghost,Steven King slowly but surely grabs your mind and makes you believe in ghosts. I'll never look at refrigerator magnets the same way again....as a matter of fact I'm throwing mine out!!
4,Excellent writing!,"Bag of Bones impressed me with King's ability to write good literature; he has a depth that I hadn't seen before in his previous novels. The characterization is superb. I would have given this book 5 stars except that I was disappointed toward the end. I felt the story deteriorated, and even got ridiculous at the end."
4,Another page-turner,"In contrast to one of the other reviews, I believe King was loyal in giving us yet another thriller. This story held my interest and King did not 'drag on' as he has in a couple other works. I found it quite unpredictable and in a strange, pleasant way. King has such an imagination and dares to go places that many of us do not - or at least will not admit. He takes a chance with every story he writes. It was nice to have a good ending and to see that good, once again, overcame evil in his story. You never know which way King will go. Sometimes the good wins, sometimes the evil wins. And then sometimes, you just never surely know!!"
3,Reasonable Read,"This is a reasonable read. Very far fetched and unbelievable, like most of his novels, it flows along quite well. A little annoying at times with very long descriptive sequences seeming to go nowhere."
5,Enchanting,"This is my first experience of Stephen King. And boy, how was I hooked. Wonderful ghost and love story at the same time. And that little girl, Kia, was easy to fall in love with. With this one I join the Stephen King's fan club around the world."
5,reader,"Well I must say I was impressed with this book. Steven King shows he is more than just a gory, gross, psychopath writer. This book keeps you turning the pages and wanting to know what happens next. I think I finished this book in 2 1/2 days. I was really feeling sorry for the guy in this book though. Seems like everything goes wrong. This is another one of those books that as I read I almost felt like I was watching it on TV."
4,enthralling read,"I thought this book was very well written. The character developement was excellent and the plot was very enthralling. However, it lacked a good ending. Everything started coming together but then it just ended. This book is one of Stephen Kings better developing novels but if I had to rank the ending I would give it a 1. I thought this book could have come together much better at the ending. So that is my review."
3,"OK, not great","This book reminded me of my experience reading ""Needful Things."" King's enthusiam lies in the character development. Most of the interesting aspects of the book are simple scenes meant to further our understanding of the characters. At times this is quite gripping, but like ""Needful Things,"" the character development exceeds the storyline and I was unsatisfied with the ending."
3,A page turner but confusing at times.,"This is honestly the first Stephen King book that I have read cover to cover...a year after I bought it. I was stuck to the book but the relationship of the characters got confusing at some points. I give it points for the spookiness of the parts with the ""ghosties"". I would recommend it to anyone who likes a quick summer read."
2,"He's getting more like a machine than a writer, Dry.","I'm sorry that I keep ready his books. They seem to me that they losing there uniqeness. He still does occasionally do a good one, ie: The Green Mile, but Bag of Bones was just not that good. Not scary at all, just kinda there. No real meat in the book, just like he wrote it because he had to."
2,"feels like a ""saver""","After reading this book, I got the distinct impression that just like his lead character, King had been keeping this book shelved somewhere ""just in case"". I was already one third of the way into the book before anything REALLY good (you know the stuff we buy horror books for)happened and I would only consider that a ""catflinger"". I've read almost all of King's work as well as a great deal of horror fiction and I must say I was disappointed. If not for the distinct Maine-isms it almost felt like it was written by an imposter."
3,"Stephen King ""Lite""","If you are expecting a page-turning, head-twisting story, read one of King's earlier books. This one, although still good enough, has few of the qualities we've come to expect from the master of horror storytelling. I was able to put the book down - that was my first clue. On the bright side, it still gave me creepy dreams. So if you're up for Stephen King ""Lite"", Bag of Bones is for you."
2,King is slipping from terror to the truly disgusting.,"King is a masterful story teller with brilliant works such as THE STAND and SALEM'S LOT just to mention a few. But with BAG OF BONES he has lost a long time fan. I was left with such a sickening feeling after finishing this book.I read to escape into another world, but in this case, I couldn't escape the horrible images played out in the final few chapters.I would like to see King focus on adults and leave children out of the gruesome tales of the macabre."
2,wrier's block???,"once again, Mr. king writes about himself as the main character. Muli-book deals, high paid author, and the inability to produce on paper anything worthy of the consumers money. perhaps it is his notion to continually publish at the holiday season and live off the reputation of his early writing days to land the big bucks. Try working a little harder next time."
2,Hated It!,"I am a huge fan of S. King and usually love all of his stuff. This latest offering, however, stinks to high heaven. It started off very well but the story never really developed. I never really knew what was going on. By the end I had lost interest. I still love the King and will alway buy his books on their release date."
2,"When will you resume your writing, Steve ?","I hope there are other people like me out there, people who read all Stephen King's books, who where disappointed by most of them (especially at the end where obviously SK panicks about finishing his book with some kind of - usually missed - climax), yet who loved ""Misery"" and ""Dolores Claiborne"" because the only monsters were 100% human. Cujo was very good too.To these people, I advise to skip ""Bag of Bones"". Once more, SK puts in some useless ""Fantastic"" (a haunted house, can you believe it ?).Still, a few good kingisms (e.g. the CYBERSPACE SCARED ME SO BAD I DOWNLOADED IN MY PANTS sticker which made me laugh for about 2 days).Please Steve, keep them simple..."
2,Far from his best work,"I ordered this book before official release date and couldn't have been more excited to get it. I have been a fan for years but this was terrible. Please, just write book 5 of the Gunslinger story. Those books were great as were most of your others."
3,To bad a great beginning did not translate into a great end.,"Stephen King once again cannot overcome a great beginning and come up with a great ending. Bag of Bones is one of his greatest works for about 497 pages and then it all falls apart in the last 30. What starts out as a spooky romance novel turns, as most of King's novels tend to do, into a gory ending. I believe that it was Mr. King himself that said if you cannot scare them, then horrify them, if you cannot horrify them make it so gory it makes them sick. If Mr. King did not say that exact phrase he certainly sticks by it. What was his greatest turns into another gory King ending much in the line with, The Long Walk, Cujo, and Geralds Game. It is certainly worth the read, but I would suggest that the reader make up his/her own ending. ----Kris Aungst---"
3,The King's New Clothes.,"Bag of Bones is not only the new book of The King, he also tries on new clothes. (This, by the way, is a review from a Dutch reader, so if all the words aren't O.K., I'm sorry). King makes a good attempt to change his direction in writing, which results in this thick brick of a book.With Bag of Bones King had weakened his pure Horror style. Instead of that, he goes more 'soft'. I think maybe for the real die hard fans, this is not easy. For new readers, this is a chance to meet the new King. I hope he reaches a lot of them, because this new one is very good.The story is good, and the plotlines are excellent, but because he has put romance in the book, the shocking effect has become less. It was his own choise to change direction, of course, but I think I like the old King better. Maybe it is a matter of getting used to. I'll try.I have read the book with very much pleasure though, and will read the next ones just as I used to.Niq"
2,Great writing without a punchline,"I read this book expecting the great Stephen King-ness I always do (i.e. The Green Mile, Thinner) and what I got was about 600 pages of....I'm still not sure. What I got was a mish mosh of allegorical characters, good against evil and flashbacks mixed in with real life that I kept reading through in hopes that it would make sense in the end-which it did not! I love Stephen King, his writing style is superb as always but if I'm going to read a 600 page book, I need it to have a point-which this one sadly did not. Hope my next venture into the King's work will be more rewarding, but if you're looking for dramatically creepy and sometimes tragic, all signifying nothing, then perhaps you will be more fulfilled than I was."
2,Couldn't finish it.,"The book actually had me until our poor hero is swimming away for his life from two octogenarians taunting and pelting him with rocks. I, to use one of King's most oft-overused descriptions, laughed until tears rolled down my cheeks. I just kept thinking, why doesn't he just climb out of the water and push them over? That and I am tired of overwritten abuse/molestation angles in writing. It just bores me."
3,Asi asi...,"Not one of my favs of Stephen King. Too long with alot of that long-ness saying alot of nothing! Just My Humble OpinionI love his writing, yes; and i liked the idea of the story. A few scary parts, and i enjoyed the love story revolving around his late wife. But sooo complicated and round about and LONG."
5,one of his very best,"I loved this book, and I could not put it down. A must for a ""Constant Reader"", as well as those who have yet to experience Mr. King's magic"
3,Good but not great,Not his most gripping tale. I did not find it scary at all only a bit confusing at times.
5,"Loved it ,Sugar","Steven King is the master of descriptive writing. He has the most fascinating way of allowing the reader to see, hear, smell and taste everthing in his books. I often read his stories and wonder where it all comes from...but maybe I don't want to know. Bag of Bones is an amazing story of love, life, and the love of life - even after life. I had a tough time putting this one down."
5,i thought the book was fabulous i just finished reading it!,I loved the book the idea and plot were both great. I don't want to say to much and give it away but buy it it is worth it
4,and a half,"I really liked BOB. If you want a book that makes u can't put it down 'til finish, sleep with an open eye, hear lots of noises in the kitchen when your are in your bedroom, there's no doubt that BOB is your book"
4,Good book,I don't usually read Steven King but I really enjoyed this book. Usually I find he gets too far out there but not this time.
4,Books,"I have read many of King's books, but did not enjoy this one as much as others. Hope the next one I buy is better."
4,A Good Creepy Read!,"One of the last books I read of Stephen King was Rose Madder and it was a big disappointment. During that time, he must have been in a lull with books like Dolores Claiborne and Dark Half.(However, I enjoyed Green Mile) I tried out Bag of Bones and was impressed!! It had the eerie, creepy, haunting feel of the Stephen King I've been a long-time fan of! I truly enjoyed the book and feel that he can still pull out a good story. At first I was apprehensive, but some parts stuck in my head which were eerie and gave me nightmares. One part that was difficult to read was the rape which was pretty graphic and detailed. However, King developed a great story that kept me reading. Surprisingly, the end was good and overall I enjoyed it!"
3,MYSTERIOUS YET SPOOKY,"I have to say that at the beginning of the first couple of chapters, I seemed to have lost interest in this book altogether but decided to take the time and read on just to see if the story would pick up soon. I realized just that as I read further because then it was only then that I really wanted to find out where the story was heading. It turned out to be a real page-turner and found out that I'd be reading until midnight and looked forward to the next evening to find out what would happen next. Bag of Bones is indeed a ""haunted love story"", (not as shaking as SALEM'S LOT, (haven't read many books by S.K. but watched a lot of movies), but very gripping and enticing just as well."
4,This is his best book that I have read yet!,"I must admit that I only just started to read Stephen King's books ,but they are good! Bag of Bones was a good book,even though it was a little slow getting started. Once you get into it ,it is worth the read ( but you start to get into it around page 400...). Most of the action takes place at the end. In all, it was a good read."
5,KING IS THE MASTER,"STEPHEN KING IS THE MASTER OF HORROR! ""Bag of Bones"" is definitely one of his best works! COMPELLING CHARACTERS, FRIGHTENINGLY REALSTIC DETAILS, and AN OVERALL EERY ENVIRONMENT makes ""Bag of Bones"" a must-read! The plot twists were completely UNEXPECTED! KING AT HIS BEST!"
4,a haunted love story indeed,"I don't know how he does it, but Stephen King appeals to the emotions like no other author I've ever read. He is a brilliant man and this book is one of the most tragic, involving stories I can think of. He reveals the pieces of the puzzle little by litte, and even when it gets scary, the novel keeps love as the tie that binds"
4,Good Read!,"What I admire most about King is his willingness to try new things. This novel varies from his ""Horror"" reputation as it is mostly a ghost story (with the necessary creepiness required). It is a great read and I was interested enough to be pulled away from everything else I should be reading for Graduate exams (I started it on an airplane). King, if you ever read these things, my only wish is that you would write another Dark Tower novel. Your brilliance shines within them. And that Damn rose is still in danger!! :-)"
5,"An awesome book,one of Kings best.I couldn't put it down.",I am a huge Stephen King fan and I feel that this is one of his best books so far. I thought the story was incredible and all of Kings characters literally jumped off the page with life. This book is just one more reason that King is the BEST!
4,Breath-taking storyline,"This isn't classic King at all. It feels more like a step in a new direction. The story line is a mesmerizing one, though. There's only one word which describes this book. ""Powerful""."
4,"Not the typical Stephen King scary, but still awesome.","""Bag of Bones,"" is not the usual Stephen King horror that keeps you up at night, but it is still a great book. The plot twists, and chilling detail, throughout the book make it a must-read for all Stephen King fans."
4,Excellent - except for an unsatisfying ending,"An excellent effort by King, with his usual attention to detail and some wonderfully drawn characters, is unfortunately allowed to end rather weakly. Very unclear resolutions (intentional ?) of threads involving the 'current world' villans and the ghosts of the past. Overall though, an excellent book."
5,The Best King Book Ever Written,"Stephen King has outdone himself again. This time he gets you where it hurts. King has progressed past just scaring you to death, this time he moves you in the most unexpected fashion. The real story here is about a love that will never die. He is moving onto a whole new level here,and I am honored to go with him. This truly is a haunted ghost story."
5,"Lovely, simply lovely","This book deals with the very human aspect of the paranormal, which is, I suspect, a difficult thing to capture. Mike Noonan is very real and his thoughts are ones I would have, if i was ever in his position, so i could identify with him. I loved the way he remembered and loved his wife, and the way he began to love Mattie and her child. But the other part of the story, the story about Sara Laughs, that was phenomenal. She was, perhaps, the saddest character in the book, and i felt deeply for her, no matter what terrible things she did. ALl in all a great story, with threads of every different type running through it"
5,Brilliant mystery with great dream sequences,"Stephen King takes you from an innocent death in the family to a bizarre past with seamless transitions. His ability to make you see the scenes, especially the dreams, will cause you to read this book in no time at all. I enjoyed how the book was written from the character's perpective and feelings."
1,The most boring book that has ever been written.,"I have always been the most ardent fan of Stephen King; however, this book is the worst that he has ever had the misopportunity to come up with. It took me two weeks to trudge through it. The only reason I finished the book was because I started it.The book was not suspenseful or haunting. The characters were uninteresting and seemed as if they had rather been somewhere else. Mr. King needs to get back to the subject matter that made him the great author, and quit writting books that just sell for his name and no other reason. I would not suggest this book for reading."
1,"Too much fluff, writing leaves nothing to the imagination.",How can a writer the caliber of Stephen King write a hundred pages and say nothing? I cannot even get past Chapter 4. I have every book he has written since Carrie. His last 4 books are absolutely intolerable. It is very hard to skip all the pages that really have nothing to do with the main story line.
1,Smoothly written but disappointing overall,"Whilst the book is well written as expected i think it was disappointing overall and just didn't have the same impact or compelling story line as with many of his other works. First and foremost King is a horror writer -this is how he made his reputation and won most of his fans. This doesn't mean to say that he shouldn't write books like 'bag of bones' which are clearly catered to a more mainstream audience but i think there should be a clearer line between his mainstream and horror e.g. his bachman pseudonym would be better utilised to truly differentiate his works rather than just for novelty value. That said, the book is still an ok read and the characters are well developed but i hope King brings his writing skills back to the horror/fantasy writing that he is rightly more acclaimed for."
1,Disappointing,"While the first three chapters were indeed enthralling, certainly Stephen King isnt himself. Why say kinder and gentler,when its really rude and crude? I did however find some good points to the book, but I would call it BAG OF BOREDOM."
2,"Captivating, but not impressive.","I'd never read any King before, but I found this pretty-looking hardcover sitting by the dumpster of my apartment complex, obviously in the belief that someone else might want it, so I gave it a try. I almost want to put it straight *in* the dumpster now. It's a pretty good story, although it could stand to be about 100 pages shorter. But there are some possibly triggering scenes in it that I feel are mostly gratuitous. I'm no prude but there are somethings that I feel shouldn't be *only* entertainment. I think the author felt a little guilty as the last page has a sort of apology to it about how even made-up tragedies should be taken seriously. Eh. Whatever.Having said all that -- it IS effectively creepy, to this scaredy-cat at least!"
2,Not King's best!,"I love S.King, but this book was boring, with an incredible amount of detail that made it difficult to digest. The story is amazingly slow and not much happens in more than 600 pages it has.What surprised me the most was that it did not looked like something King would writte, just not his style.To me hole book was just a big waist of time."
1,I think that this book is pretty stupid,"I haven't quite finished this book but from what Ihave read(347 1/2 pages)the author has not expressed enough of his natural talents in this book. I think that it will get better as i read more,but from what I have read he could do better."
1,"This is a good book, but........","Ok, before you people peck out my eyeballs, let me explain why I gave it 1 star. The book got 1 star because it is extremely good and King throws in all kinds of old characters (Thad Beaumont, Bill Denbrough). The reason the book didn't get 4 or 5 stars is that I don't want to give all you bandwagon King fans another excuse to keep reading his stuff. The only King books you people like are the weak, emotional ones like Rose Madder and Bag of Bones. Jesus! Where the hell were you people when he was writing under Richard Bachman? Where were you people when he was struggling to pay the bills and feed his family?You bad-mouth everything else the man does, so he has to resort to writing the kind of crap that you people will like; not the kind of tales he wants to write. So return your copies of the Dark Tower series cause you don't deserve em.BTW, ""It"" is the greatest King book! Eat it!"
2,I WAS BORED,"When I couldnt take the boredom another page, I tossed it back and re-read one of his earlier, much better books. I cry when I think about how many trees died to make this weiner."
2,I think 2 stars is too generous..,"Bag of Bones....Bag of Bones, Bag of Bones..That's all I hear! This book was okay while I was reading it but the more I think about it, the more stupid, self-centered, and smutty it was! I would not recommend this book to younger readers because of all of how smutty it was. I love SK, and you can find many posts from me around, but I definitely will stick to his older stuff! If you like these kind of books, sure read it and try to just think about the writing because it is as good as ever, but I find it a little hard. I hope it comes through how hard I am trying to not insult anyone, and I'm sorry if I do!"
1,Beautiful garbage,"I made it all the way to page 500 or so in this book. It then met the wall of my house. King allows you to hope for things that cannot come to fruition in this sad excuse for literature. He should stick to what he knows best, and give the readers what they want, not pull the rug out from under them in mid-story in the holy name of 'high literature'. This one is absolute rubbish. Well written, but with plot flaws uncharactaristic of what King usually delivers. Maybe getting writer's block would be a good thing for King..."
2,Not one of his best...,"I was literally beside myself waiting for this book to come out. I had previewed the first chapter on-line and couldn't wait to see which direction it was heading. I am a huge Stephen King fan so I threw myself into this book with the usual gusto. The book held me captivated like all King novels, however, I was left feeling a little empty at the end of the journey."
2,Don't get me started.,"Boring, long winded and about a 3 on the suspense scale (10 being the best). But he's still the King, only this time the King has written better books. Oh, how I long for another Needful Things!"
3,"Not one of King's greatest, but still a good read.","Bag Of Bones is a good read, but seems a little a little disjointed, and seems to lack King's usual humor and sense of spirituality. His comment that celebrities are paid well only so we can pick them apart is very cynical and seems to indicate that he is in a dark mood. His character loses almost everything (which is typical of King's characters) but seems to have no hope; he is manipulated by his family history and a bunch of dead people who are pissed off. I did get caught up in the last part of the book but there were really few surprises about the outcome."
2,The verbose Mr. King has done it again.,"I reluctantly purchased Mr. King's latest tome due to all the publisher hype surrounding it. I used to be a big fan, but have definitely cooled towards reading anything by Stephen King. Almost all of the reviews stated that he has his old form back. I personally could not find any of the old form in this lengthy, wordy novel! The characters and setting are clear and concise, which shows that Stephen King is a gifted writer. I wish that he would use this gift more productively, and with a little less overwriting! I suppose that a staunch Stephen King fan will enjoy this book, I however,wish that I had waited to buy this novel in the used paperback version."
3,Stephen King is not a romance author,"Okay, this book was just typical, not at all close to being what it was made out to be. The man just isn't a romance author, he's getting soft in his old age. I put up with in it Wizard and Glass becuase, well, it's The Dark Tower. Now this book was okay, but not King standards. It was the Kings of the 80s where all his worst books were written (Chiristine, Cujo). I guess diehard fans will like it, I'm just a Dark Tower person I guess."
3,Audio cassette version is a real killer!,"I am not a big fan of SK, but I have read some of his books. Bag of Bones sounded interesting, and I picked up the audio version the other day. When I did, I did not notice that the narration was done by SK himself. The story was enjoyable, but my God, to listen to SK whine away for 20 hours was almost more than I could take. He makes no attempt to 'act out' any of the parts of the book and just rattles on and on. The plot was interesting, but think twice about the audio version."
2,kept hoping it would grab me...no pun intended,finally at around page 250 i didn't have to make myself pick up the book and read. it was a hard job reading this one...a big disappointment...
2,At least it's not as bad as Christine,"Although I have never read any of Tabitha Kings work, I wonder if she's ghosting for her husband? If this is the new style of the master of modern horror, Jeez, no wonder he's doing commercials these days. I wish he would stick to what he does well, getting into his characters heads, and then killing them."
1,Forgettable....like some bad tv movie,"The plot resembles some bad tv movie on the Lifetime channel. It's predictable, boring and overall, it makes me want to puke, considering I shelled out my hard earned cash to buy it. One of the most boring novels I have ever read, or maybe because it's my first Stephen King book, and he probably has his own bunch of hard-core fans who have grown familiar with his work."
4,A beautiful but somewhat confused book,"I'll spare you the plot, as everybody has seen fit to retell it here. But there is one amusing part of the book where the hero-novelist is told that his ""latest"" book (actually written years earlier) is more ""mature."" I don't know if King is having fun with us, but this is a more mature book, in the sense that its primary focus is (until the end) love, understanding, grief, time, and emotional growth. As the NYTimes' Daniel Mendelsohn writes, however, in the end it becomes confused about what it wants to be. It ends up a typical King book (that is not a criticism), part legal thriller, and mostly horror. Where I yearned for Mike Noonan's feelings regarding his dead wife and other significants to be explored, I am treated instead to The Shining. Many issues are left unresolved. Nonetheless, the book's slower pace and, yes, maturity, make it well worth reading for King fans and non-King fans alike."
4,Good book,"Awsome book! The first 100 pages were a little boring for me, but soon as I passed those pages, I could not put it down. I believe I read the book within a week. Again a masterpiece from King!!ps: I saw the movie version of this book, was not impressed at all."
5,Excellent!,"This book was read on a Kindle. To me, it was excellent. Mr. King has grown from writing strictly horror to writing stories with more substance and more believable characters. This book has been made into a television movie, but the movie is just a sampling of what the book is really about. Do yourself a favor - skip the movie and read this very fine book."
4,Bag of Bones,"Whether Stephen King intended this book to be scary or not, I don't know, but it wasn't. It is still an excellent book. If you're a true Stephen King fan, you know that a lot of his books aren't scary; they're just excellent stories. For example: Hearts in Atlantis, The Dark Tower series (four books so far), Dolores Claiborne, The Green Mile, and Different Seasons (The Breathing Method is still one of my all time favorite stories), to name a few. And if you're a true Stephen King fan, you also know that he writes stories with endings he wants. Whether you like his endings, I'm sure he doesn't care. He probably didn't write them for you; he wrote them for himself. Don't complain about endings you don't like; they're still well written stories. And Bag of Bones is no exception! It's a great story that's full of heart, emotion, and chilling events. It's a story of a love lost, a love found, and other events that I'll leave to the reader! I love ghost stories and this a good one!"
4,Surprisingly good!,"My parents are huge King fans, myself, I am an avid King fan, as a writer I tend to critique other's work far to much to enjoy a book. This book is very different from King's usual work, his characters are complexed, with high conflict, and believable. The entire book is filled with a number of conflicts which King melds gracefully together, until the climatic, surprising, ending."
2,Two for oh wo....w,"I ran down on this one about page 100. I am a King fan, so I tried, I really tried. Just couldn't keep my eyes open. I feel certain it gets better but I keep remembering John Cheever's comment when asked what books he liked to read: ""Anything I can get past the first page of..."" Well, I went many further, but I found this just too meandering, sleepy, and, frankly, a tad pretentious (re. the ""book world"").For some reason, I kept hearing Rhett Butler saying ""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn."" Giggles. Lights out. Sorry, Steve. Maybe next lifetime."
2,King needs some barer bones,"Although the thriller Bag of Bones was a page-turner, in the end I felt victimized by King's overindulgence. The well-drawn characters were likeable and heroic, but the plot became so dependent on psychic wanderings into surrealism, my suspension of disbelief was ultimately destroyed. I have not read a lot of Stephen King, but was totally impressed by Deloris Clayborn (the book; not the movie!). I found The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon another overlong exercise in silly horror, and after reading Bag of Bones I'm becoming a skeptic. Anyone who has the power to write books like Deloris Clayborn and The Green Mile or a story like The Shawshank Redemption should not stoop to the verbal wanderings of Bag of Bones. I kept wondering if anyone had the guts to tell King he needs a decent editor to make him pare down the excess flesh of his verbage. Bag of Bones was a disappointment; I'll recommend it to no one."
2,King tries to Escape from the Horror Genre . . .,". . . and creates a nightmare. I've read almost all of King's books (not the Dark Tower stuff, and I couldn't slog through Insomnia). This book is terrible! I skimmed the last 150 pages and read the Epilogue. The first 100 pages of the book dealing with Noonan and the death of his wife, and then the plot with Mattie and Kyra, prove that King can write straight fiction. I was engrossed in the aftermath of his wife's death and rooting for his involvement with Mattie and her daughter. Even the haunted house part was ok. But merging it all together was horrible.And by the way, someone posted on around Feb.19th, speculating that King's wife, Tabitha King, perhaps was ghosting for him. If this is the result, what an insult! Tabitha King is a wonderful writer in her own right, and I encourage people to read Pearl, One on One, and The Book of Reuben. Don't expect any scariness beyond the day-to-day frights of life."
1,Timothy Grace -Australian creative writer.,"I'm sorry that everyone thinks that King is the greatest writer of all time but honestly, I HATE this book. I'll give it to him that as a fellow writer he wrote the book quite well with lots of long words, but sorry, its a bad and boring read! I think most of us read King be scared to death but NO."
3,not typical king,"i think my problem, as i started reading this book, was i had the impression it would very scary, with a lot of twists. it was a good book, but not what i had expected. i wanted the wife to be evil, conniving, with a dark secret past. it was somewhat of a let down. she was some goody-goody who unfortunately croaked before she had time to be an evil, two-headed cyborg who dines at human buffet tables. i wish he had gone into the story of sara smiles (the person) much more than he did. he barely scratched the surface. that in itself would have been a great book. it was an enjoyable read nonetheless, but a little dissapointing."
3,Definitely not his best work but not his worst either.,"I found that the book started very slowly. I was half way thru before it started to interest me. King likes to be very descriptive but he could have chopped quite a few pages (at least 200) and had a much better story. Still, when you finally get to the end it was interesting."
3,Very disappointing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,It took about seven chapters for the book to actually setup the story. The middle of the book was actually really good. Unfortunately the ending was one of the worst I have ever read from King.
2,Not even close to King standards....disappointment!!,"It seemed like King had this one sitting around for a rainy day and decided to send it in. He took way too long getting the whole story going, he introduced too many characters. King, go back to your original style!!"
2,A courtroom drama with a ghost thrown in for fun. Boo-hiss.,I was sorely disappointed with this novel. Stephen King needs to stay away from courtrooms and go back to the Dark Tower.
2,"Surprisingly Boring, Vastly Overrated","After reading all the good reviews for this book, I picked it up ready for a treat. I've read all of King's books and most of them more than once. But I doubt I'll ever pick this one up again. I don't care how well the characters are written; if the plot is weak, it all falls apart. For me, the most exciting part was when the legal fight started heating up. But if I want that, I'll read Grisham, and anyway, that plotline was soon aborted. By the time the story ended, I honestly didn't care about any of the characters."
2,"King falls to ""Gump Syndrome"" and blows a great story","It's hard to say why this is such an amazing disappointment without giving away much of the story. Suffice it to say that, as the summary says, King has fallen for the Forrest Gump theory: take a story which is basically escapist fantasy and drench it in cynical pessimisn masquerading as bittersweet realism. There's no reason for two or three of the major, negative plot points near the end, other than a disturbing sign of bitterness and depression on the part of King. A great ghost and love story trashed by a lousy final 1/4 whose entire point seems to be ""life sucks and then the lucky ones die."" Take us back to wonder, Stephen, if I wanted cold hard reality I'd watch the news."
2,Bag of Bones is not his best.,"Bag of Bones could not capture me in the first 100 pages and as I read it the more I thought that maybe this is Stephen King's book that he had kept in a safe deposit box all these years waiting for the opportunity to sell it. Like Tom Clancey, more and more we are seeing a lot of book that takes a lot of energy to carry and sometimes not worth it. Stephen King is the best of Horror writers and he needs to return to the basics and keep scaring the bejesus out of us. Sorry, two stars for this one. Four and five for most of his others."
3,A warm-up session before The Dark Tower V ... I hope.,"Although the book gets off to a slow start, King is still a master at his art and knows how to capture his audience. This book sort of reminds me of Rose Madder. The horror is fairly minor, but the suspense is still there. Far from King's best (and I've read them all), but I still found myself having trouble putting it down. Once the plot begins to unravel, and the questions start being answered the story just rolls on. So if you've had trouble getting into it - give it time. The characters liven up and even after it's all done you feel they're still alive. I hope this is just King warming up his fingers towards the next Dark Tower book - 'cause we're waiting."
3,A book of unrealized potential,"""Bag of Bones"" is a frustratingly uneven telling of a potentially powerful tale. If the hallmark of great work of fiction is the readers inability to stop reading then ""Bag of Bones"" fails miserably. The narrative lacks momentum and pace. If the reader can battle their way to the end, however, they will be rewarded with a stimulating and intriguing ending. If the entire book had been as interesting as the last 50 pages... we can only wish."
4,A nice surprise,"This is not the usual horror story from Stephen King but rather a charming, melancholy ghost story which held me captivated to the very end (which is a surprise to me because I usually hate the endings in Stephen King's books as for example Langoliers or Needful Things)Bag of Bones has less violence than some of King's other recent work, although when it occurs it is genuinely jolting. There is as well an almost overpowering sense of frustration and unfairness to some of the proceedings.This novel doesn't seem to have attracted the attention of some of King's better-known books, which is a shame because it's one of the better books by King. You can even read it if you usally don't like hus books."
5,Haunting and Beautiful,"Bag of Bones is in one respect no different from the other novels that are the best of Stephen King's (The Dead Zone, Salems Lot, The Stand, Christine): it's a book about people, and before you finish the novel, you love the people and feel like you know them.Mike Noon, Jo, Mattie, and Ki will continue to be a part of me for the rest of my life, and I'm a better person having read this novel. If that sounds schmaltzy or melodramatic, well, so be it."
1,It hits you,"Stephen King must have had writers block himself when he wrote this novel. He goes on and on and says nothing. If you are going to spend that much time trying to build characters, the reader better be engaged big time. But then it hits you, you don't care what happens to these people. Not SK's best effort."
4,"Forget the Tower, Grab this Bag!","Finally, a book worthy of King. I am so pleased to finally read a ghost story with such wonderful,dark morality at its core. I have been disappointed with Kings recent Wizard and Glass (closing it after 630 pages)that I thought he might have lost his talent. I am happy to say that he has not!"
4,Enjoyable Read!,"First off, let me say I am a huge fan of Stephen King-even named my son after Jack in ""The Talisman"". However, I will admit that Bag of Bones is not his best book-nothing will compare to the superflu, Pennywise, The Territories, The Dark Tower. Even Mr. King knows that so I won't compare Bag of Bones to his great works. I enjoyed this book very much and found some of the scenes very scary-even though the situation was at times absurd. I became attached to the characters and was anxious to find out what was going to happen. There were some ""cheap"" tricks (best word I can think of!) but they were all hallmarks of King's writing. This book will not convert anyone if you dislike King's writing style, but if you are a fan, it will provide a few hours of satisfying reading. p.s.I have read other posting and some people seem to think some loose ends were not tied...I can't think of any so maybe you could post your questions?"
4,Still Outstanding,Stephen King again comes through with another masterpiece. A must have book for the avid King reader. Excellent service and delievery from Amazon.com.
3,Good storyline once you get past the first third of the book,"I listened to the audio recording of Stephen King reading his book, and have to say, although I was a little put off at first by his voice (he's not cut out for reading audio books, even his own, sorry but it's true), I gave it half a chance, and by the time I was on Cassette 5, I was hooked onto the storyline. Good ghost story plot, (couldn't wait to see what would be written on the refrigerator next!) and some great original plot devices. The meat of this book is in the middle; if you go in prepared for thin stale bread on the outsides, you won't be too disappointed."
3,Worth Reading however I was somewhat disappointed at end.,"I didn't want to put ""Bag of Bones"" down once I had began. I felt that some of the dream sequences were a little hard to follow and the end could have been more satisfying but overall it was a great book."
4,Fair,"Given that the reviews here were somewhat mixed when I first got interested in the book, I nonetheless went ahead to buy and read it. Although Bag of Bones started up somehwat slowly, I found that the story got better and more involving as I progressed. I could even identify with most of the characters and King's writing style kept me curious about what would happen next - probably a desirable characteristic of any good book. At one point, the book seemed to have a clear climax where suspense and curiosity made me turn the pages really quick and I didn't want to stop reading. However, this climax was only brief and the story returned to its general pace. Overall, a fair book, and probably one of the best King has published recently - but clearly nowhere near The Stand or even Desparation."
4,Pretty good,"Bloated? Of course, this is Stephen King. But still it's one of his better books of the last 10 years or so, during which time even one of his short stories runs 40 pages. I don't think he could write a shopping list under 10 pages. But I digress. The book is good at 530 pages. At 400 pages, which Koontz could have done it in, it would have been excellent. At 350, which Bentley Little could have done it in, it might have been great"
4,a very sad and scary love story,"I thought this book was very much in keeping with Stephen King's newer style of writing. Different from the classics but very good. I liked his descriptions of love never lost in all the characters. He has an amazing grasp of the everyday which I really enjoy. He can make you see the characters so clearly, I really liked Brenda Meserve and Bill Dean, so stuck in the past. Stephen King has such a grip on his characters. Aside from my admiration of his love for his characters this book also scared me silly. when he spoke about Mike Noonan's encounters with ghosts made my hair stand on end. He continues to be an excellent storyteller. I started with ""The Shining"" and have enjoyed all of his books"
4,A delicious taste of the sensual in the mysterious,"King shows himself to be a master weaver of a tale in this thoroughly readable novel. If you enjoy being teased along by and drawn in to the narrative world of fiction, this is a textured tale to delight your imagination. Just when you think that you have become entangled in ""too much detail"" and think you want to put the book down, the fabric of the tale relaxes enough to further entice you to continue on. The play on the phrase 'bag of bones' resonates throughout the book, beginning with stark fictional characters to a satisfying crescendo in the concluding mystery of the story. Strong connections between the erotic and horror may require parental discretion."
5,Refreshing !,"This book has the ingredients to keep you guessing from one page to the next. The ending is unexpected throughout and considering the classic Rebecca was an influence on the book, Mr King has taken our imaginations to another level. Keep up the good work ! Readers enjoy - sleep well."
5,Best King novel since The Stand,"A true sign of a writer compfortable with his position, recommending other novelists and analysis in print. Combined the Sci-Fi of tradition of King with the potential of the legal intrigue of Grisham"
4,His best since Misery.,"After reading every King book up to Misery I couldn't finish another they seemed to cover the same ground. So, I picked up Bag of Bones with trepidation. I was suprised. This is one of his finest works yet. I'm back into King and looking over his last ten years of books to see what I missed."
3,OK King,"After reading ""The Green Mile,"" I was ready to believe again that Stephen King can do no wrong, but this overly long, dour novel reminds me of why I went a decade between King books. As the quote from the NY Times review aptly notes, King can't make up his mind if this is serious fiction or horror. Or maybe he just can't quite get the two styles to mesh the way he has in the past.There are some good bits here, but the mystery of Mike Noonan's summer home is never quite brought into focus and the tension of the custody battle over poor Kyra Devore gets swallowed up by the horror story. I think Mr. King would have been better off just writing horror or just leaving horror behind this time.Still, there are worse ways to spend a summer's day than reading this."
3,Not his best,It's almost like Mr. King has lost his belief in the things he writes about. I didn't get that spine-chilling felling that I usually get when reading his books.I wasn't drawn in to this story and it wasn't believeable for me.
1,Bag of Bones is a Bag of Words,"Somebody please...Get This Man An EDITOR! This is King at his most ineffective and inefficient. Other long books of his were much better, like The Stand. This is just not worth the time and effort.EKW"
1,Overall letter grade=D,"Some time in the early 80's King forget how to write. When I think that this is the same guy who wrote The Dead Zone(excellent), I know the previous statement is true. This story is full of silly ghosts and very boring, one dimensional characters. Money and fame definitely killed this guy's talent."
1,ahhhhhhhhh,"Please, please, enough with the FIVE STAR reviews. That is preposterous. Read IT, The Stand, The Shining, Salems Lot and Pet Semetary. Then, I challenge you people to give THIS thing 5 STARS. King was a superb writer, for a while, he was in such a zone, it wouldn't be absurd to call him the best in the world. In the nineties his stories don't have the fire, the originality, the excitment, the horror...he's burned out. And it's perfectly understandable. NO ONE can maintain that level for 20 plus years. But you people saying things like ""B.O.B. is his BEST EVER"" are literally killing me."
4,King has done it again!,"Stephen King has done it again. Not many authors can combine horror and romance and turn it into a great novel. But that is exactly what King has done with ""Bag of Bones"". This is a novel that faithful King readers will love. For those who have never appreciated King for his previous efforts, this is a book that will turn them into King-addicts."
4,"One of the best ""Haunted Love Stories""","You are immediately engulfed as you begin this intoxicating story of Mike Noonan,Jo,(the love of his life--even in her death), and the evolution of his relationship with Mattie and Kyra Devore. For those who are Stephen King fans, the setting is all-too familiar, the small New England town, where the family lines run deep and the history runs even deeper. You come to know Mike well throughout the story, enough to become enrapt in his feelings and able to almost anticipate the actions that evolve. You'll begin to care for Mattie, and for Kyra like a daughter. You too will become entrenched in the lines and the history that has run through the TR and through Sara Laughs since the death of Sara Tidwell, understanding her legacy the way that Jo had begun to, and Mike had no choice but to learn. Take the time, read it through, you will enjoy this story as it haunts you as well."
4,Good Reading,"King did an excellent job keeping you guessing in this one. There were some areas that could have been condensed and were sometimes confusing. For the most part, not bad. Would make a good movie."
4,Acquire some life experience before you read this one!,"Convoluted...the characters' family ties stretched my credibility threshold in places. As usual, the story starts out in the mainstream, ""normal"" mode, and Mr. King smoothly shifts it into ""spooky."" You have to suffer some significant losses to appreciate the realism of this story. Mr. King plucked some of my heart strings; made me laugh and cry. So many mysteries in life, and the beyond is just limited by our perception anyway, so who's to say what is ""real"" ~ being haunted can be an everyday experience. (I removed the magnets on my refrigerator door.) Take your time reading this yarn!"
5,Amazing,"Stephen King, in my opinion, is the greatest storyteller of the 20th century, and this book proves it. I didn't want to put it down! A great book for someone who wants to get back into King or who doesn't like ""horror"" and thinks that's all King writes."
2,Boring,"I didn't enjoy this book at all. I never cared about the characters. Usually I can't put his books down, but for this one, I couldn't wait to put it down. The only reason I finished it was because I had already spent money on it. Try again Stephen! Go back to the good stuff like Needful Things, The Stand, or Carrie."
2,Bag of Bones was just that!,"There is no doubt that King is the master of story-telling. His writing style is engaging and genuine; however, the plot in Bag of Bones is lacklustrous. Bag of Bones is hair-raising and spine-tingling - but only in the beginning. The same scary stuff occurs throughout most of the book without hardly any implication in the story line. The story line does not take a turn until the end of the book. The characters' dialogues are uninteresting and corny. Mattie is banal. The relationships (specifically between the evil townspeople, Sara Tidwell and the Red Tops, and Michael Noonan and his crew) are a tangled web of nonsense. What saves the book is the main character, Michael. He is likeable and substantial. His narratives and thoughts introduce ideas that draw the reader in. Essentially, the book is excellently written, (word-wise), but lacks a firm nourishing plot."
2,You're all killing me.,"For the love of God, this is NOT a five star book. Stop it! King has some BRILLIANT work, the best in the world. But you CANNOT give this five stars and have it mean anything, when such masterpieces as the Stand, IT and The Shining exist. What does that make them? 10 stars! Please, I beg you to stop! It's ludicrous. It's a mediocre story at best! I don't have a problem with the length...it's just not particularly inspired!"
2,typical King,"Typical King. It contains the usual kernel of a fine novel buriedbeneath an avalanche of words andover-the-top images. It's been asuccessful formula for him, but awaste of talent."
2,A Drastic Disappointment,"I'm sorry to say this is not one of King's better novels, even though I stuck with it to the end. Here are the pros and cons of the novel. King's story is surprisingly original. I must say this is a new direction for him. The novel contains some interesting plot twists. I liked the ""crossword puzzle"" theme especially. Rogette Whitmore is a strong, frightening character, the kind you love to hate. And the final paragraphs prove to be an interesting conclusion to the story that surprisingly impressed me. BUT...that's not to say the novel has many drawbacks. The third-person narrative stinks--one minute Mike is a serious literary personality, quoting Maugam and Hardy, but the next he babbles on childishly about erections and breasts. Kyra and Mattie are annoyingly perfect. And, needless to say, the plot seems to drag on forever. BAG OF BONES is sadly a disappointment. It has its faults, but I guess it's good-natured and kind of innocent. It's truly a mixed bag."
2,Weak weak weak weak weak weak weak,"There was a time when every published book King gave birth to was something to behold. Now it seems every 4th or 5th book is really worth the effort.Very, very disappointing."
3,Okay King,"It wasn't his best, it wasn't his worst. Although I was sucked in to the story in true King fashion, I wouldn't recommend it to non-King readers. As is typical King style, it was weird with a twist of cultish overtures, suspense, and a little love thrown in for good measure. The ""good"" characters were richly developed and believable while the ""bad"" characters and storyline were not. I still feel his early works are his best."
2,BOORRRRIIINNNGGGG!,"Boy, talk about a long winded, go nowhere novel. This is king at his worst, except for maybe Gerald's Game <GRIN> Hope that he starts to put out some decent work again sometime soon."
3,Okay read but not as good as his others,"I am an avid King reader, having read the likes of It, The Stand, Four Past Midnight, etc. I picked this book up thinking it would be as compelling as these previous books. But I was a little disappointed because I thought it was too long and the storyline was not that great. It did have its good parts but I would recommend sticking to his other books."
3,"Quick nurse, the editor's sissors!","There are phases of this which remind of ""vintage"" King, if you can wade through the swamp of self-indulgant ""insider"" book-biz info, meandering 7-11 philosophy, and lurid male mid-life crisis fantacies. And the boring life-details! He stops just short of a daily report of the guy's BM size and consistancy. Steve, this isn't ""Everybody Poops"" for cri'sake!"
2,May December romance was a turn off for me,"I love Stephen King and this story was good, but would have been better if Mike was a little younger or Mattie a little older, all the men in this book were perverts and Mattie was so young she does not know they are. A little creepy, when I was 21 years old a 40 year old was not even on my radar. So Mike is the biggest pervert of all them, Did not like his character at all."
2,I'll stick to his non-fiction,"Although I enjoyed the movie ""Stand By Me"" I had never read anything by Stephen King. I read his recent non-fiction ""On Writing"" and thought it was great. And so when I saw ""Bag of Bones"" I picked it up.A good case can be made that the writer Mike Noonan is an alter ego for Stephen King. If so, Stephen King thinks very highly of himself. Not only is Mike Noonan this resourceful hero rescuer, but his devoted sexy wife spends her afterlife being devoted to him, and an incredibly beautiful 20-year-old is hot for him too. What a stud.Early in the book, I thought that the protagonist's wife was actually mad at him, and I thought that the reason for that would be revealed. That made the supernatural stuff scary, and the protagonist's psychology interesting. Half way through the book, the supernatural stuff became ludicrous, and it was clear that the wife was not mad at him and the book was just a bag of mediocrity."
3,Bag of Wind,"King writes on and on about the same things, I guess his fans are happy. Same script, weird folks in a small Maine town, guess their secret? At least this time the supernatural involved was not a space spider. He claims this novel kept him up at night. Doing what??"
2,He's Done Better Stuff,"I know there are people out there who will blast me for what I am about to write, but I didn't feel that Bag of Bones was a particularly good novel. It lacked punch. Normally once I get into one of Stephen King's novels, I'm hooked. I can't stop reading. I was easily able to put aside Bag of Bones. At a good many points, I wanted to skim through the rest in an hour or just return the book to the library. I will admit the ending was good (I never expected the water thing with Mattie), and that line, ""Give me back my dustcatcher!"" still strikes me as phenomenal.... but frankly I don't think the book was worth it. I think King is capable of writing a better novel, scary or otherwise. Personally, I'd advise people to buy the book for their collection, but not to bother reading it. On a better note, I really enjoyed The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, Hearts In Atlantis, and the first 2 installments of The Plant. What can I say? That's my opinion."
1,A drag to the end,The most disappointing of the King books I've read. I had to force myself to finish the book whilst asking myself if he really wrote it. The story was not compelling and seemed to lack integration. I might rest on King for a while.
1,Who Abducted Steven King's Muse?????,"Ok, I'm a devout King fan, but this book was a waste of time (and a waste of paper... the story could have--read, should have-- been told in many fewer pages. Problem one... A great deal of the plot is taken from Daphne Du Marier's Rebecca (a book I highly recommend... a great read and a lot shorter). Problem two... the plot didn't even start to emerge until a hundred pages had past. I would really like to know what has happened to King since his greater earlier works (Pet Semetary, for instance. Or Rose Madder, now that was great reading). Between this one and The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, I'm going to be very hesitant to read anything King puts out in the future."
1,"All (dull) atmosphere, no substance","This book was just interminable. I've read all of Stephen King's books, and this one is by far the worst -- nothing interesting happens in it! This one and Insomnia were the only 2 I've ever had to literally *force* myself to finish, and I only managed that because I'm extremely stubborn. If you're expecting a rollicking good, involving story like Desperation or the Green Mile, this isn't it. It's also no Dolores Claiborne -- I suppose people could argue that not much happens in that, either, but I loved that book -- the characters were *involving* and interesting. I didn't give 2 whits about anybody in Bag of Bones. If you liked The Dark Half and Insomnia, I guess you might like this, but I didn't like those, either, for the same reasons."
1,"...Please, Trust me !!","I've been a fanatic of King's work since ""Carrie"" and I'm really disappointed about this one (I read it in about 15 days, forcing myself to do so because I was looking forward to get a Good Book after it). The problem about this novel it's not its length but the enormus lack of inspiration that -I'm sure- is the reason of the endless repetitions and the silly, boring dreams. If you love S.K., please, DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!! By doing so, maybe, you'll increase the (few) chances to see our (ex)favourite writer's redemption."
3,Way too long!,"This is the first King book I've ever read and quite honestly, it was about 300 pages too long! I truly had to push myself to finish ""Bag of Bones,"" because there were just WAY too many minute details dragging it down. But, if you can push past that (and don't mind taking two or three weeks to finish the book), it is an enjoyable read."
4,A good read.,"The story was a little slow to start, but once it finally did, it kept me turing the pages."
5,AMAZING! Steven King Hit home with me!,I am a huge Steven King fan and Bag of Bones was excellent! As the weather turns cold in New York nothing is better that warming up with a chilling novel. This book has left an impression.
5,One Of The Best,"Surely this has to rate as one of Stephen King's best books ever. It's the only one to make me hide under the covers when the light went out! Thoroughly enjoyed it, and can recommend it to anyone who's got the time to read it from cover to cover without putting it down - so make sure you've got the time!"
3,Worth reading for the last 100 pages!!!,"Starting this book was like seeing King as if He was a pure mystery writer;hard for me to get use to.The last one hundred pages however was my vintage King;just like your old pair of favorite broken in shoes;""Please Mr. King no more experimenting!!!"
5,His best in years !!!,"Well, I've read all of King's books, and I don't remember being so stretched from them in years. Untill I read ""Bag of Bones"". It was absolutely thrilling, and yet it was also very romantic. I'm sure most of King's fans would love it. Now I'm waiting for the next King's book."
5,Bag of Bones,"This audio book is definitely one of the better stories by Stephen King and this one would be special, as the reader is Stephen King himself. Starts out slow (as most books do) and then starts picking up and leaving you on edge."
5,Great book!,I love Stephen King. I hadn't read him in a while and somehow I had never heard of this book. But it is now one of my favorites Stephen King's. Unlike most of his books this one was written in first person. It's not as supernatural as most of his books. Though I love all of his classics this one is one of the best. It was awesome. He's so good with description and characterization. I love you Stephen!!!
2,Didn't live up to a Stephen King book,I bought this book to give Stephen King a try. I have heard for years from friends and co-workers how much they liked reading Stephen King's books. I wasn't impressed at all. The book is approx 550 pages and could have honestly been approx 350 pages. It seemed there was a lot of 'filler' that didn't have anything to do with the delivery of the story line. I also didn't like the ghost/haunting story line. I anticipated it to be more of a suspense book.
3,Something's Missing,"I realized after I finished reading this on Kindle that the Afterword to ""The Constant Reader"" is missing in this format. If you are a King fan, you know he usually writes a Foreword or an Afterword to ""The Constant Reader"" in his books. I happened to have the paperback version of this as well and realized that it was missing on the Kindle version.Overall, this book was pretty good. I hadn't read it yet, but decided to since the movie version is coming out. I thought it could've been shortened in some places that seemed to drag. They violent scenes were very graphic."
5,Bag of Bones Best King Book Ever,"The first real ghost story King has written, it is a welcome deviation from his usual style of writing, and I have always enjoyed and appreciated King's work. Richly drawn characters, surprising villains, and haunting landscapes make this book a necessity for all King fans. King's ability to create a larger meaning with metaphors of water and social impact is fascinating, and his use of literary references to underscore the mysterious lake house setting were captivating. After I finished this book I immediately picked up Du Maurier's Rebecca, which I also thoroughly enjoyed. King has really outdone himself with this one."
2,too slow a start,"Started out way to slow, could not even hold my interest, watched the movie the other night and it was much better, the part in the book that I did read through took them about 2 minutes on the screen"
4,Must read!,"I hate Stephen King for making me stay up until 2 am finishing this book. I love him for writing a book so engrossing it forces me to keep reading until the end. The length is rather daunting, and there might possibly be some parts that could have been trimmed, but I couldn't tell you what any of them were. The action unfolds slowly, but in such a way that keeps the reader turning pages. The suspense creeps in until you can't remember when this nice little book about a novelist who faces writers' block after the death of his wife turned into a scary-ass ghost story. Another interesting thing is that by the end, those you sympathized with toward the beginning reveal themselves to be just as evil as those who are ""bad guys"" all along. I can't really say much more without ruining the exciting revelations of this compelling novel."
4,A Different Kind of Creepy,"I recently became a King fan and love his books for their horror which is so grotesque and scary, you can calm your fears by reminding yourself, 'this can't be real'. This book was different in that respect because the debate of whether or not ghosts are real is one that will live on forever. For this reason, Bag of Bones kept me up with my lights on and the blankets pulled to my chin on more than a few occasions. I do think the story kind of dragged on a little and I thought the end was rushed and a little silly. For lack of a better word, it was cheesy. Other than that, a good, scary read by our favorite horror writer."
2,King needs a more assertive editor,"I've been a King fan for years, but many of his recent novels just go on and on! And...so does this one. King's editor really needs to get on the ball. This story could have been told more effectively (and would have been a more enjoyable read) in half the words."
2,"MR. KING, PLEASE GET TO THE POINT!!!!!","After 300 pages I am putting this book down FOREVER..Extremely thin plot, routine characters (evil rich-man in wheelchair, trailer-trash single mother, etc.)Critics always complain his books are too long...this time, they're right.Reminded me of FREEDOMLAND, where a 250 page story idea (or 1 hour Law and Order episode) was blown up to over 700 pages!I want to OLD Stephen King back! (Dead Zone, Firestarter, The Stand, Cujo...)"
4,b.o.b,"After reading this book several weeks after reading The Green Mile and Different Seasons, I have personally come to enjoy this ""type"" of King to his conventional blood and guts horror feasts. Although those are great too, his more recent trips into sophistication ring true as not just some more Steven King best sellers but true literary masterworks breaking through the genre barriers. Bag of Bones is a complex story that starts a bit slow but never bores. This one picks up the pace and races toward a climax that's almost a bit too much to handle. King is always easy to read, and seems to wave a magical wand when it comes to detail. King's gift of observation translates into words so accurately that it is....well....scary. It's no mistake that many of his books become movies; you can practically see them as you read them. Bag of Bones is no exception. I very much enjoyed this book."
5,wonderful book,"I absolutely loved Bag of Bones. It's a departure from King's past novels, but still retains the same storytelling skill that makes all the characters so real. It felt so easy to identify or sympathize with so many of them. This time the focus didn't seem to be scaring the reading so much as it was simply a man's story about rebuilding his life after his wife's death, which eventually leads to him getting caught up in a situation that's bigger than he thinks. The grief he feels for her death, and love of a mother for her child, the shocking realization that life is really short and fragile are all themes that come to the reader's attention without King having to push it into your face. The plot unfolds beautifully. I've read it more than a few times already, and each time I catch more and more of those small, subtle details that just add to the overall richness. It's definitely a longer book, but if you have a few nights free or plan to take a long plane ride, it's a worthwhile read."
1,"Mr. King should have stopped when he wrote ""Salem's Lot"".","In this book, Stephen King refers to the pressure imposed on best-selling authors to write a book a year. Evidently he was referring to his own experience as this is the longest, most tedious drivel I have ever attempted to read. The biggest horror I found was in trying to find a plot of some kind. I even tried skip-reading, but even so was bored to tears.Mr. King is a talented writer, but does not put his talent to good use."
1,"Very, very disappointing","I have read every book Stephen King has written and this has got to be the worst ever. It took me weeks to agonize through it and I only finished it because I started it and hoped it would get better. Now I am reading ""Wizards and Glass"" and can't believe the difference in writing, like 2 different people wrote these books. I hope Stephen King will go back to his old style of writing and leave the love stories to the romance novels. He is still the best horror fiction writer ever."
1,Awfully BORING book,"I usually love Stephen King books but this is a horribly, boring book. I tried my best to wade through the page after page of boring text but finally gave up halfway through the book and trashed it. Mr. King, you just lost a reader."
1,his worst book so far,ugh! this may not be much of a review but it wasn't much of a book. the plot revolves around a writer that has lost his ability to write.i guess even steven king knew it wan't a good book. i hung in there to the end hoping it would get better. save your time and money.
1,No Wonder Used Copies Sell for 3 cents,"This book is Loooooong winded. There are numerous places where King goes on and one about stuff totally unrelated to anything, such as the passage where the best selling author rambles on about best seller authors and their work. Boring!!!The story is slim. Town's people killed two people generations ago and now angry ghost is out to get revenge by killing one kid from each family. OK.Spooky stuff encompases 10 pages out of the 300. Lame, rambling crap and King's musings on writing and the mistreatment of pop novelists take up 76 pages.CLearly King is so big no one edits his work. Too bad. He has written some good books but this one is blah. Avoid."
1,WHY is not available to US Kindle readers?,"Stephen, you dog, I hope you read this. And when you read it, I hope you hear a screaming three-year-old's voice over and over and over. I want my bag o bones, I want my bag o bones, I want my bag o bones, I want my bag o bones, I want my bag o bones, I want my bag o bones, I want my bag o bones.I have a sinus infection and was comfy in warm sickbed with my sample and then told I couldn't buy it in the U.S. For doing this to me, you deserve to have that snotty-nosed 3-year-old in your head for 1 month.Now I have to go read Goldy the Caterer in Colorado..."
1,"How could you, Stephen?","How could you write this piece of trash and then charge your fans money to have to read it? Was it ghost written? This couldn't be your work.I wish I had been like some other people here and stopped reading after only 100 pages. But no, I kept right on reading because I was enjoying the romance angle of the story. Then Mr. King hits me with his ""twist."" I closed the book on the spot and never re-opened it. I have never, ever, ever done that to a Stephen King book.I love a good twist in the tale. I hate disingenuousness. What a rip-off. Stay away."
1,king's worst story ever,"i have been an avid reader of steven king's books for about 7 years. this was the worst book he has ever written. as far as i'm concerned king should go back to writting classics like IT , THE STAND, SALEMS LOT, PET SEMETARY, and CARRIE. when i read this book it was as if it was by a different author. i wouldn't recomend this novel to anyone."
3,Bag Of Bones,This book is very interested for reading because it tells us about our daily life. We can get moral lesson in this life.
4,A Return to King proves pleasureable,"An avid Stephen King reader, I had drifted away from him in recent months. I must say I was pleasantly surprised with this offering. I had heard some bad things about most of King's recent efforts so maybe I went in with lower expectations than normal. That said, I found Bag of Bones to be an engrossing read. Perhaps it is a little long winded at the beginning, but it picks up steam in the middle and hits the mark at the end."
3,A Little Long Winded But Hey... It's Stephen King!,I love the works of Stephen King and for that I will probably never judge him too harshly. This Bag Of Bones is not his greatest work but I must say I slept with my light on many a night!
4,A bit long but a good ride,"Stephen King has grown as a writer as he's aged and his most recent works show the horror of the mundane more than the horror of the extraordinary. Bag of Bones starts as a story of sudden loss, of both one's spouse but also of one's ability to work. From this starting point, King employs many of his stock plot devices and these used to annoy me but now they feel like the comfortable quirks of a writer I've spent a lot of time with.The book's climax and denouement were a bit anti-climatic but I enjoyed the ride and King's willingness to sacrifice characters in deference to story integrity."
2,"normally i like/love king, but........","this book is about hauntings. a woman with a young girl is haunted by her heritage. a rich ancestor trying to take custody of the child. a writer whose wife is dead, becomes involved. mysterious happenings indicate supernatural hauntings. i thought this was a horror novel. it was not. and as a drama book it wasn't that interesting either. to be King, this was strangely uninteresting. the plot wasn't silly, but it didn't grab me. i wasn't really taken by the characters either."
3,A Good Read But Lacks something,"Okay. I'll Be honest with you. I am a HUGE Stephen King Fan. In My mind the man can do no wrong. But you might ask, why I gave this book 3 stars. Over all the Book is very well crafted, but to me it is more about a man trying to cope with inner demons. I would Feel juistfied in sayting that Bag of Bones is better than the average book. I have read a lot and felt that Mr. King is good in weaving a tale. It was the Villans in this story that I though really weren't up to par as they should be and the end was rather anti climatic. But I will let you judge for your self."
2,I GUESS THE MAN IS TIRED,"Not the best work of Mr. King. My idol, is (I guess) tired of writing. Or the change from Viking to the other house is doing a lot of damage. See, is a ghost-curse-bloodline story. REALLY SLOW FROM BEGINNING TO END, the story behind the story is lame, the evil is way too stupid, and...well; the worst I have read of King work. It keep you reading to the end, just to see how everything turn out, and if you are like my (a Stephen King fan who will buy all that he writes no matter how awful the book is), then buy it, otherwise do yourself a favor a ask some who have it to loan it to you."
2,This book was boring!,"I kept with the book for as long as I could thinking something surreal was going to happen. I have never read a StephenKing book until this one, and I was totally disappointed. I will read one more as everyone deserves a 2nd chance."
3,Familiar,"Stephen King's fans are bound to love this book, especially those who have hailed his recent work, which this one resembles: it's long, it's wordy, it repeats earlier themes (and plot devices), and it's chock full of Maine stereotypes. Some readers undoubtedly find this charming but I prefer the compactly-written ""Salem's Lot"" (a traditional but powerful vampire story) or ""Four Past Midnight"" (and its quartet of imaginative novellas). But I suppose there are worse things than the familiar, and this tale, about a blocked writer and his budding relationship with a heart-of-gold town girl and her psychic daughter, is as well worn and comfortable as an old glove. The emotional angle--the writer's coming to terms with grief--is well handled too, as is the commentary of being a wealthy author out of ideas. Mr. King himself isn't there yet but in his next work I hope he moves into new territory."
3,I really had to push my way through this one,"This book left me with a feeling of dissapointment. I had to push my way through the last half of the book. I also found myself skimming throught the pages at times, it seemed as if King kinda went on a tangent of irrelavent issues. I think the idea of the book was great but it would have been ALOT better if you knock out about 300 pages form the 732. The one thing I didn't understand was if the cut on the hand he saw in his dreams of Sarah Laughes had any signifigance to anything. I feel alittle lost on that. If anyone can offer some clues I'd appreciate it alot !!! In general, if you are looking for a ghost story, try something else. But on the other hand it was a good story.... just toooooo long."
3,Loved it. But the book's a bit baggy in more than one sense.,"Look: I loved this book, it kept me reading and there were points when I was annoyed about having to work and stuff. But sorry I do think it is way too long for its story, almost like a huge dress on a thin woman. A friend from England sent me another book, SOMETHING DANGEROUS by a guy called Redmond which will be published this fall here, cos that company also publishes King there. Anyway, I thought that this guy Redmond was sorta a new King i.e. he was writing like King did when he started. But I love you're books, Steven, they're great and I hope you soon feel better enough to start writing again. You're a star. What about some mroe GREEN MILE'ing?"
2,ZZZZZZZZ. A very long boring story.,"If this were King's first novel, he would find himself flippng burgers for a living. At no point in time did I feel a draw to finish this story. Bag of Bones never captivated me, not once. I have read most of King's works and Bag of Bones is by far one of the worst books Stephen King has written. Stephen seemed sex obsessed throughout the whole story, breasts and nipples, even talk of pedophilia when ""John talks to Mike about getting custody of Kyra."" As for being SCARY... looking at my monthly phone bill scares me more. It is obvious that fans of this book have never read King before."
3,Not your typical Stephen King!,"Although I enjoyed Bag of Bones, I had to keep reminding myself that it was written by Stephen King. It is really unlike his other novels and short stories! It was an interesting read, but really didn't have the ""zing"" that most of his stories do. I kept waiting for something to happen!"
3,A TIPICAL KING ?????,"I was very surprised about this book. Also a little disapointed. Where is our great master of horror? Of course, there are some very tipical and shocking parts, but at the end of the story you have to ask yourself- DO YOU REALLY LIKED THIS BOOK?? I like it but in another way I like It, Desperation and Shining. I even wondered about, how sentimental stephen king can be if he wants to. But what do you think did he enjoy to write this book?L.O.L. from switzerlandbeside: I am happy about all your e-mails"
3,Nothing New to Read Here,"This book started out to be a very interesting and, what I thought to be, a departure from King's usual stories. The characters were well written and the story moved right along at a good rate. The problem starts towards the end when the usual ( and predictable) graphic violence and formula style of horror writting occurs. Good vs Evil, love conquers all, yadda, yadda, yadda. This does sell books, but I for one am tired of the same old stuff. Still as I stated above, the depth of character devlopement and rate at which the story develops keeps this a page turner."
4,Very Good,"I thought this book was really good. Although, sometimes it bore me. I thought that King did a wonderful job on this book. It was really well writen."
2,Another disappointing potboiler,King seems to have become bereft of the narrative talent that made IT and SALEM'S LOT horror classics. The protagonist in BONES is a writer who keeps a discard file of literary duds that he submits to his publisher at intervals to fulfill contractual obligations. Could this be an autobiographical novel? I expected more from King's return to his Maine roots and was greatly disappointed. A pedestrian effort at best. Certainly not classic Stephen King.
2,Alot of wasted pages,"I am a long time fan of Mr. King. When he's good, he's very, very good but every now and then he comes up with a stinker. In this long, boring story, he brings up the practice of authors penning books in advance - to publish when needed. I believe this is one of those. Don't waste your money on this turkey."
5,Sublimely Scary,Bag of Bones and Caleb Carr's Angel of Darkness are the two scariest books I have EVER read.Bag of Bones made me sleep with every light on in the apartment for weeks.It was just so...plausible.I haven't read IT yet. I don't know if I'm that freaking brave!
4,"AN ENTERTAINING STORY, YET DRAGS A BIT","This book has really held my attention. At times it's quite frightening, especially when he's at Sara Laughs. I'm not sure what's going to happen in the novel, and that's one of the things I like most about it. It's difficult to predict. I understand the character's motivation, as I'm able to identify w/ his problems. I also like how he's not really scared while in the home. A good read."
4,"A good non-fantasy, non-gore scare","I enjoyed this book and thought that it was scary (in a creepy and not gory way) and also absorbing. I love to read books where at the end of each chapter there is some sort of little zinger to keep you from putting the book down before reading just another few pages, and King is the master of that, in my opinion.Also I had been disappointed with some of King's more recent books, such as Insomnia and Rose Madder, where whole other worlds are created. I find the books that are more ""reality"" based much more frightening. I feel that a book is much better at generating fear if you can feel that the events actually could happen, and the plot is not just total fantasy.I did feel it was a bit long and drawn out, but still definitely a good one! also nice to see cameos from so many other King characters."
5,Good Work,"For me reading most Stephen King books is like eating your favorite dessert.Pace yourself to make it last. Although I love the "" keep you awake alnight "" King books, this was a change from the usual material. Ofcourse it has the spooky haunting, but it is an emotional love story. I hope to see many more books on the same level from him in the future. And all I have to say to the people slamming Stephen King for this book is that I hope someone doesn't spill a glass of milk at your house. Just a little harsh, Don't you think?"
5,Excellent!,"I really enjoyed Bag of Bones. I've read only a few novels by Stephen King (Carrie, Pet Sematary, Misery, and Bag of Bones), but this one is my favorite so far. I was hooked by the first page. Now..I'm moving on to IT. :)"
3,"That's more like it, Mr King!","I found this an eagerly-awaited improvement after the poorly written splatterpunk that was ""The Regulators"", and ""Desperation"". Perhaps ""Bag of Bones"" could have benefitted from some editing (particularly in the over-graphic descriptions of the narrator's dreams, which lend little to the plot), but at least King has attempted to draw characters rather than relying on descriptions of gore and goo. This certainly isn't another ""Dolores Claibourne"", but shows that perhaps King can still write good books after all."
4,King writes an emotion draining ghost story,"Stephen King's latest is another in a long successful series of ""I can't put this down"" tales which combines elements of books written before, but has a fresh originality about it.Again he writes about a best selling writer (remember Dark Half?).We're in Maine again (that's no surprise).The writer has a house (and a memory) full of ghosts, including his wife's.We do a little time travel around this summer home which is haunted by those who have gone before.The writer encounters new tragedy but, as frequently happens, there is redemption for the writer.Mostly, he just leaves you wondering all the way through how the redemption will be realized and the result is satisfying for King fans."
3,well written but far from his best,"The reason I purchased ""Bag of Bones"" is in part because of the reviews of other readers. After finishing it I wasn't impressed. The idea is good, the writing is well done and at times a nice departure for King but in the end the central figures of the book just don't cut it. The main character behind the plot is poorly written. As a reader it was hard to feel sympathetic or terrified, pretty much something you need in order for this type of book to work well. A bland book that could have been excellent."
5,BAG of BONES Great!,CHAPTER 1 from BAG OF BONES was GREAT. Stephen King has embarked on a new writing style and I hope he publishes a few more the same way. I felt like I was actually there and cant wait to continue my reading on September 22nd when the full book comes out.
5,Stephen King's best yet!,I must admit it's been awhile since I've read anything of Mr. King's. My reading preferences have been mostly non-fiction of late. However when I had the chance to read an advance copy of Bag of Bones I decided to give it a try. I was not disappointed. I highly recommend this book to all of Stephen King's fans and also to anyone who has never read him.
5,Best KING in a LONG TIME!,"This is the BEST King has written in a LONG LONG time.And like any dedicated fan of course I've kept buying his books in the hope that he would return to some of his former glory. And now after a long wait HE HAS !! Believe me the wait has been worthwhile!!!! This book is captivating and quitely intense, it is not as graphic in detail or as gory as some of his other greats (IT, The Shinning) But this is definately a MUST for any serious King fan, and if your just a 'beginner' as far as his novels are concerned then this is a FANTASTIC place to start!"
4,An Entertaining Thriller,"During his five year stretch in a Florida prison Dave Delano comes up with a brilliant plan that's going to make him a millionaire. The plan involves stealing drug money that is being shipped in a luxury yacht that's being transported in a huge ship bound for Europe (one million and a half to be exact). The dilemma is that the FBI has a tip and has sent a couple of agents along for the ride.The whole story develops during this sea voyage. It may seem limiting to keep the whole tale in this uncanny setting, but somehow Philip Kerr manages to keep the story exciting. There are a lot of plot twists in this thriller that keep you guessing all the time, but it never gets too confusing.The story gets better as you keep reading. You are going to meet some pretty funny and bizarre characters, and the ending which kills a lot of novels in the, ""Thriller that has a lot of Plot Twists"" genre, is very rewarding. Overall it's a great novel."
3,shallow fun,"Reading this book was as close as I believe I've ever come to actually reading a blockbuster movie. Not an artsy film, but an actual big budget big stars big production kind of a movie. Which is not exactly what I look for in a book. It was an easy and fast read, with smart cracking characters possessing the depth of a soapdish. The story line was simple enough to follow, with predictable twists and double crosses. The cover says that the book was optioned for a movie, so I'd reccomend waiting for the big screen treatment. After all, the typical things one normally worries about with a book adaptation, won't be a problem here. No depth or charm will be lost surely. Exept for maybe an occasional spark of wit, which in my opinion is the book's most redeeming quality. Should have given it less then 3 stars, but I'm feeling generous, after all I didn't fall asleep once while reading the book:)"
5,Good enough for pool-time!,"As a not-so-avid reader, i picked this book up because it was so cheap and i needed something to read at the pool! It has met my expectations. A little romance, a little trash, a little humor; it is perfect for passing the time! I have really enjoyed it but have never read any other books by this author. I think for a hard-core reader, it may not do the trick, but for a quick and easy read, this is your ticket!"
4,Very entertaining comic like thriller.,This is the first book of Kerrs work that I have read. I found it very entertaining and I liked the fast pace it never lost throughout the book. The plot was not extremely fancy but had a few nice twists to it that made reading the book a lot of fun. It is a gangster novel and probably not what you would call literature of high value but it indeed is great entertainment.Some of the scenes and characters might be comic like but at least Kerr tries not to sell it for something else (like he did in Esau with putting in 'scientific' contents that he has no clue of.) This is a perfect book for a long trip and I recommend it to everyone that likes to be entertained with an action packed gangster novel.
1,Disappointing for Kerr,"I have read a couple other Phillip Kerr novels and found them to be very complete, well researched and truly captivating. ""A Five Year Plan"" does not however have any of the flare that Kerr's past novels have. The story for the most part drags, there is no interesting facts or history, and characters that the reader coundn't care a less about.This novel made me wonder if Kerr just published this to get a movie deal. It is missing all the essential parts to make a good novel, but has just a basic storyline that will tranfer to film. For the new ""Kerr"" reader I suggest ""Esau"" or ""The Grid"" which are much better well rounded books."
2,Do yourself a favor...,"if you want to torture yourself, that is:Read BERLIN NOIR then read this.Or better yet, read BERLIN NOIR then run face first into a brick wall.You will walk away feeling the exact same way as you do finishing A Five Year Plan: ""What the hell happened?"""
2,Only one suprise is too few for a Kerr Novel,"After reading March Violets, I was a Kerr fan. Pale Criminal and German requiem were outstanding and then the slide began. Philosophical Investigation and Dead Meat were just a little off center. The Grid tried but didn't have the snap, Esau slowed and then Five Year plan is the least interesting. Too much moralizing became corny or cant and while four letter words can add snap, in this case they bacame as boring as ""ahh"". THere are interesting parts to this tale, but I would rather reread Berlin noir."
2,A Poor Man's Elmore Leonard,"This was my first Philip Kerr novel - I was aware of the Berlin Noir novels and also aware that Kerr has changed direction in recent years, writing high-concept pre-packaged blockbusters which Hollywood buys for outrageous sums of money. Bearing in mind that the rights to this belong to Tom Cruise and his producing partner, I was expecting to be very impressed. Boy, was I wrong.Written in a bland, unremarkable prose, this reads like a cheap rip-off of a second rate Elmore Leonard novel. Kerr has no ear for the American mob-speak dialogue which makes Leonard such a joy to read. And plot? There's hardly any. Once they get on the boat - it becomes a cheesy romance piece. I'm reminded how well Leonard did the FBI/crook relationship in Out of Sight (and that was one of his weaker efforts).For great (hard-boiled) crime novels, I'm going back to Leonard, James Hall, and Dennis Lehane"
1,Step away from this book,"If you like gratuitous vulgarity and an unengaging attempt to insert an intellectual backdrop over a lame story, you'll love this book."
1,cheaper on the nespresso website,Ok so on here these start used from $185+ but on the nespresso website for this EXACT same machine NEW is only $129. you may want to adjust your prices sellers!!!! It doesn't matter how much you oasis for it it matters what its worth now! Thanks!
4,"Great coffee, fast, easy to use...but not very green, or cheap","We use one of these machines as our backup, when our fully automatic machine breaks...and we're always a bit sad when our main machine is repaired, as we haven't been able to get coffee out of it that's as good as Nespresso. We live in Switzerland, and here Nespresso makes a big deal about efficiently recycling the capsules, and it's very easy to find places to leave them when they're spent. Unfortunately, there's no mention of recycling on the US website. Despite this, we bought one for my parents living in the US, since the coffee is so good; not a particularly moral decision."
1,Terrible Machine,"This machine is a total piece of crap. Don't waste your money. Buy the Starbucks Impresario or a DeLonghi machine. I bought this as a gift for my wife. The machine would not work, just kept whirring and blinking lights. The instructions are worthless, 3 or 4 pages at best. There is no capacity to access the parts of it to see what's wrong. And the customer service is the worst part. The person I spoke with had no idea how the machine worked, they were reading from the same manual I was and when I pressed to speak with someone with technical knowledge, they said they would have to send that along in a letter to that department...what! Is it 1946? Give me a break.I never was able to get customer service to help me and I sent this machine back to go with a different company since Nespresso cannot make a decent machine or help their customers at all."
2,Love the machine/hate the coffee,"I am in Seattle and used to a very strong espresso (can you say ""Charbucks""). =The strongest espresso blend offered at Nespresso pales in comparison. It tastes waterdowned. I've tried to figure out if I""m doing something wrong, but it's a simple enough machine that I'm sure I'm not. Probably good if you drink your espresso ""straight"" but if you add milk or ice, it's disappointing, at least to me!"
2,bad Nespresso machine,"have now bought two of these machines one for the office and one for home. They make great ""nespresso"" and they are fun. However both of them develop problem after only a few cups were brewed. Somehow the coffee doe snot come out of the nozzle, but is pressed into the ""garbage"" box for the used capsules. Disappointed."
5,Amazing Coffee,"If you appreciate good coffee, no if you appreciate fabulous coffee, this is the Nespresso machines are for you. Firstly the Nespresso system isn't just one of those cartridge-coffee machines, it is an Espresso system that delivers either an espresso sized coffee or Lungo (double espresso). You buy the cartridges from Nespresso.com, and are available in roasting strengths and styles. There are exclusive blends and coffee styles from all over the coffee world, pretty much every style for every taste.The machine is a semi-automatic machine in that you add the water to the reservoir at the back, allow the water to heat, when ready you insert the cartridge, press the button and enjoy the deliciously smooth experience. The used cartridges are collected at the back of the machine so you just keep making coffee without needing to empty every time.Easy to clean, easy to use, you only need to enjoy the coffee experience."
1,Pump broke after 3 months,"I bought mine in November after reading the reviews on Consumer Report. The Espresso is expensive but pretty good. My problem is with the reliability of the unit and the bad customer service that Nespresso provides. I initially called them, the CSR took all my information, tried to do some troubleshooting and then said that a Technician will be calling me to send me a replacement and schedule repair of my unit. 10 days later no one called so I called again; the CSR could see all my info and apologized that the Tech did not call but still she said that she needs to troubleshoot the machine again before having a tech call. I told her that was ridiculous. She said because her name will be on the work order she has to trouble shoot the machine again. I asked to talk to her manager; she said he is out of his desk but he will call me within the hour. The manager never called! I will call again and this time I am going to ask for my money back."
5,Great machine!,"Like other reviews say, it does make a little bit of noise when the coffee is being made but since it's so quick, you will not notice it. Delicious coffee. You need to find which flavor is your favorite! Great product though. Highly recommend!"
5,I found it on Amazon,"For years my husband would on occasion mention his favorite childhood book ""Doctor Dolittle's Puddleby Adventures"". Recently I went on the hunt for an orrigional hard cover copy. As often as I purchase from Amazon.com, you would think I would have started there first!! Was very pleasently surprised to find it and in excellent condition. Now he is reading it to our grandsons!Doctor Dolittle's Puddleby Adventures"
4,good fit,Bought a used 2001 Chevy Impala that had a hole worn in the carpet at the left heel of the driver. This floor mat fits nicely and covers the worn spot. It would have prevented the hole in the first place if the previous owner had one. The factory floor mats do not cover the entire footwell like this Nifty Premium mat. It is a little softer and more flexible than I expected but it is doing a nice job. Gray color matches the Chevy factory gray.
5,Great Product and Price,We have purchased both SAE and metric in this product. I would highly recommend them. No problems with them so far.
5,Great product at a excellent price,These sockets have done everything that I have asked of them. Not a single one has broken to date. After a lot of heavy use the sizes are difficult to read. Carry case is a huge plus & keeps me from loosing them.
4,Great Value,These are perfect for the weekend mechanic that needs to have an impact set in the toolbox for occasional use.
3,Okay for the price,"Received the order and it was complete. I have yet to actually put the sockets to use so as far as durability and function, I have no reviews on that as of yet. I gave this only 3 stars because of the lack of quality control on the sockets. For one, the hole drilled in the side of the socket for the drivers anvil spring loaded ball, some of them were drilled too shallow or close to the edge of the socket so the impact driver anvil end wouldnt hold the socket when pushed all the way in. The 3/4"" socket also came with no markings whatsoever, just a blank socket. I havent measured to make sure its actually a 3/4"" socket."
3,Ok sockets,Not bad for the price. Typical of China impact sockets they are thick-walled to make up for the inferior steel. So they won't fit in all situations but work on the bigger stuff.
3,Poor delivery,"I like the magazine as a whole,I really enjoy reading it but the delivery was terrible. My first issue arrives 4 or 5 later than expected, then they promised me to send me an extra issue as apology for the delay. And finally for my one year subscription I ended receiving a total of 3 issues. Don't worth it!"
1,Never received the first issue,I ordered this subscription in early June. As of 9/20/07 I have never received the first issue. This has happened before with this magazine when I tried to subscribe through another seller. The seller said the magazine was not being exported to the US or something like that so they cancelled my order.I sent an email but I have never received a reply.
2,Naive utopian view of cyberspace,"Two things I really didn't like about this book: (1) The agonizingly painful (to read) language of post-modernist thinkers. Terms like ""deterritorialization"" and ""rhizomatic processes"" infest the text to the point where you feel like you're reading some strange dialect of the English language. It's maddening. (2) The author presents a charming but hopelessly naive utopian view of an emerging social world, centered around the sharing of knowledge within cyberspace, that will usher in a marvelous new era of individually-centered democracy and freedom - the notion of ""collective intelligence."" One wonders if Levy has actually spent any time at all communing with the people who populate the chatrooms and message boards of cyberspace - ""collective intelligence"" indeed, more like ""collective prejudice and stupidity."" It is completely beyond me how others have found this book to be of any value whatsoever."
3,"Good, but not the best.","First, I am a huge Dave Hollister fan. I have loved his voice since his days with Force One Network. I feel he is totally overlooked, especially when people like Jaheim get attention for something Dave has been doing for years. His voice is always incredible, raw and full of conviction. But I do think it's time to try some new things musically, not to change his style, but to expand on it. I fell in love with his debut, which was brilliant, but only the 3rd CD (Things In The Game Done Changed) can rival the debut. I feel this CD only recycles what he has done in the past. Not that the music is bad, but I feel as if I heard it all before. I'd like to hear him expand lyrically, melodically and musically, a live band with extended jams would be nice. I still love Dave, but it's time to flip it up a little. Peace..."
3,Dave...what happened?!,"I'm a huge Dave Hollister fan. I first noticed Dave on his solo project ""Ghetto Hymns"" (which I still play at least twice a week in my car). His second solo album, ""Chicago '85...The Movie"" was a masterpiece and a shining point in his career, and he continued this success on his third album. Because of this, he's one of the few R&B singers that I feel keeps it realer than real. He personifies that ""realness"" on this album, but it becomes repetitious and boring after the first few songs we hear it.Moreover, the second half of the album contains the same boring R&B cliches that have plaqued the industry. I felt Dave should have stuck to his roots--eschewing the carbon-copy commercial singers for the style that has gained him his fan base. I hope Dave will return to his quality music on his next album. In sum, buy this album if you are a HUGE Dave Hollister fan, otherwise, stay away from it."
5,He got pipes from the windy city!!!,My mans from way back he just gets better and better. The true soulful sound that stirs your soul; only a handfull of artist throughout history have been able to do that and he's one of them. His vocals resonates in your soul...cop it before its gone! You make us look good!Thanx for keepin it truely soulful for us folk..
2,Nothing Real to talk about,"While some of the previous bad reviews were on point, I think ones who gave it 4-5 stars were just trying to be nice to Dave. The songs never went anywhere nor did the CD have a smooth overall flow. The single ""Real Talk"" could have made some moves if it could have ever heard by anyone. Like most artists like Dave Hollister it will seldom if every make it off Internet Radio or a Midnight Radio show. Which by the way was the only place I ever seem to here the Dave Hollisters of the world. Buy this CD only if you want to complete D. Hollister collection."
5,simple and elegant,I bought this for a wedding shower gift - it is elegant and simple and what new couple couldn't use a small pitcher of this caliber to compliment any gathering.
4,Very pretty,"I really fell in love with the Sophie Conran collection and have both this and the cake stand. I must say that when I opened the box and saw how little the packaging for the pitcher was I kind of chuckled, it's the large size, but it's a bit smaller than I thought 3 pints would be.Other than that (which is my stupidity), it's lovely and will come in handy for gatherings throughout the year."
5,Same quality product as my own as a kid.,"Parts are all very similar to what I had 30 years ago. Definitely some improvement, but also some 'mass-production' quality issues (The plastic parts) - But overall a great, quality toy. It enables me to spend some quality time with my 5 year old son. - Granted, there are too many tiny parts, complicated assembly diagrams, and conceptual steps for him to do alone, but that seems to be the reason we both enjoy it."
3,'Twas okay,"I expected a little more romance in this. Megan was a tad too dramatic at times. It took a long time for the relationship to really become passionate because the past kept being brought up in the middle of conversations. It was sort of distracting, but other than this, I think the story was decent. Emma is still a great writer nonetheless."
5,Must Have for Artists,"If you want to get your work out there to be published, this is the book for you. It is a must have for any kind of artist. I was amazed to find all the listings they offer in here. Each listing is detailed into type of work, contact info, and the book is indexed real well. It is categorized and also you can look people up by their name as well. Another great feature of this book is there is a glossary in the back if you are unfamiliar with any terms used in it. This book will be so valuable to me. If you are serious about getting published but you don't know where to even start, get this book. Very important tool."
3,Amusing.,"Yun-hee Lee, Demon Diary vol. 2 (Tokyopop, 2000)Raenef decides to leave the castle and not return until he's a good and proper demon lord, but his plans get sidetracked by Chris, supergenius and next in line to become the high cleric of a sect that is currently locked in an uneasy truce with the demons. We also get some backstory about Eclipse trying to find Raenef. Good stuff, as usual, despite Kara needing to find a new author after Chi-hyong Lee needed to drop out. (No word on whether the new author is related.) ***"
1,"For ten bucks, this needs to be in colour!!!!!","Maybe I don't get manga, or perhaps I'm just an old geezerette and this comic is over my head. Yes, the illustrations are nice (most of them) but where's the story? I always end up disappointed - but I guess my expectations were unfounded.Oh well, back to reading slashy stories...."
2,What a coward....,"This is probably one of my least favorite books from Diana Palmer. Yes, its a nice love story of two people waiting on each other for over 6 years. Lovely....however, i tired of Shelby being such a coward about her feelings...she lost the love of her life 6 years earlier because she didnt have the guts to tell him she loved him...years later she is still a coward, extremely naive and weak. Justin is great, but poor man. Nice story but horrible woman character."
2,A troop carrier pilots comments about 6 june 1944-,"The author did a very POOR job of researching the facts,he only repeated misinformation from people who either were not there or did not know the facts. He adamantly refuses to discuss his outrageous lies with us-We would appreciate your cooperation in curtailing the sale of this book until he retracts the lies that he fabricated about the TROOP CARRIER PILOTS .How do I know they are lies I WAS THERE. Burton S. Cook Major USAF"
5,A great oral history when listened to on Audio...,"I listened to this book via CD. It was great. I have seen numerous D-day documentaries. The late Stephen Ambrose narrates this book himself.There are numerous heroic accounts depicted in this book and many tales of the brutality and suffering of war. I found myself choked up at numerous points in the book... in sorrow for those who lost their lives and what they went through.I would listen to any history as opposed to reading it. (more so because my commute is long and there are too few WWII titles available on CD.)You won't be disappointed if you purchase this audio book. The other amazon reviewers can give a better feel for the historical accuracy and lost vantage points in the book. It focuses more on the US contribution to D-day and specifically on Omaha beach and the paratroop landings.However, it is a good tribute to all those who took part in the battle of Normandy. We should never forget that peace is a blessing."
2,a true waste of a true opportunity,"ambrose's prose is excellent, and his collection of stories and anecdotes is unsurpassed. truly riveting... but his attempts at analysis and historical revisionism are so shoddy, unsupported, and overtly juvenille that one wonders whether to call him a playground bully or an official army propogandist. the fact that the united states fought a gruesome battle is unquestioned; the fact that the german army lost that battle is unquestioned; but to draw from such broad and sweeping statements of history such generalized conclusions about the makeup, character, and courage of the ""British soldier"", the ""american soldier"", or the ""German soldier"" is insulting to all who bled and died on those beaches. there were cowards and heroes on both sides of the beach and both sides of the ocean. i would hope that, in the future, mr. ambrose will support his accusations and statements of ethnic judgement with more than just a few stories."
1,"It's true, foreigners are gutless....","...and hats off to Ambrose for having the insightfulness to say so.It's great to see an armchair combatant who, without having any experience of war himself, knows enough about it to say all the limeys out there that day were gutless.And I think it was a neat idea to leave out maps of all the non-American beaches.One day a truly great American historian will follow in Ambrose's footsteps and write a history of D-Day which tells our young people that Americans were the only people who fought on D-Day.Sure, Ambrose's book is not strictly honest, but who cares about that when patriotism is at stake?"
1,Lied about Eisenhower,Its sad when you go out and buy a book about history. You spend a couple weeks reading the book. Then you love it. You even feel bit more educated about something you are passionate about. But if you realize that the person who wrote it just might have decided to make up whatever details suited him to tell his story. And then you know he's been known to do such a thing on other works. Then he's a proven liar who build his whole career out of pretending to be best buddies and biographer to Dwight Eisenhower. Nothing Ambrose wrote can be accepted as truthful. The publishers should warn people.
2,"good on allies analysis, but unbalanced-","this book has given fairly good account from allied perception, but is very unbalanced as its analysis from the german point of view is very biased, as a good history book views should be taken from both sides in the battle, e.g. it has ignored many important points that contribute to allied success, such as the crippled german command hierarchy, intervention from hitler, the seriously delayed preparation of german defence; i would recommend the author to do more research to give a 2nd edition of this book, especially the report and plan from field marshall rommel, i personally think that rommel had splendid view and plan for the defence of coast, especially his ideas on panzer deployment and defence fortifications, which readers will find it totally rewarding and worth, fortunate for the allies, rommel did not have real authority and did not take over the command until too late before the invasion take place"
5,The Glorious and the Terrible On the Beaches of Normandy,"Stephen Ambrose, through the stories of hundreds of D-Day veterans, offers the reader a fulfilling look at the planning and ultimate success of ""Operation Overlord."" Ambrose creates a work which is simultaniously enlightening and remarkably interesting. Most importantly, Ambrose tempers the patriotic feelings that discussion of the success of D-Day often elicits with a firm reminder of the terrible price at which that victory was won."
2,"Canada, Britain, and the Commonwealth: Buy a different book","Ambrose is such a Yank. He treats us as an afterthought. He tells us about U.S. civilian reaction to the invasion -- get this -- BEFORE he tells us ANYTHING about what happened at the beaches we care about -- Juno, Gold, and Sword -- where our guys are. He has the gall to quote our PM, Mackenzie King, as saying ""the landings were making good progress"" three (!) chapters before he tells us what happened at Juno Beach. Oh, so Mackenzie King was talking in the Commons about Utah Beach, was he?Ambrose refers to George VI as ""the king of England"". That would make perfect sense if D-Day had occurred on June 6, 1544. His guy supposedly attended a graduate school?Get a book by an unbiased UK author instead."
1,"thick, shallow, biased, wrong title, junk book","Thick book, shallow knowledge on WWII, highly pro-american biased. A most wrong title: D-Day was not THE climatic battle ( Stalingrad: the most long, bloody, a decisive turning point). Junk book, definitely. I still don't understand how I was fooled into buying it, I should ask Mr. Ambrose for a refund."
1,hmm d-day,"i heard that Mr Stephen E. Ambrose is one of the most regarded US historian so i picked some of his books like Eisenhower , citizen solider , D-day..... Now i know the reason why the American love him , honestly his style is fascinating , but Ambrose's books are just some cheap progandas , kind of novels than facts ,and deeply bias. D-Day is no exception .and since this is one of the most bias book , i wonder can we believe the information it gave ?"
3,Climactic ? Really ?,"I would have given this book 4 out of 5 if not for the author's desire to give Western Front more than it deserves. Climactic battle ? Most important day of the XX century ? Please. War was decided in steppes around Kursk and around Stalingrad. Invasion of Normandy was a last nail in Hitler's coffin but there is no way it changed the course of the war. Books like these promulgate the miopic views expressed by some of the reviewers: ""of the war in Europe rode on an Allied victory in France"", "" the battle that would turn the tide of World War II"", and etc. I understand that we all want to honour the sacrifices that were made during the war, but remembering that 4 out of 5 German soldiers were killed in the Eastern front, I cannot comprehend such sentiments."
3,D-Day USA,"Dr Ambrose - an academic rather than a soldier - provides us with a thorough account of the planning and build-up to Overlord, the bombardments and the airborne operations. He succeeds in adding something to the sum total of Human knowledge on the subject. In the book's most extensive section we are given a very detailed analysis of the events on Omaha Beach - hour by hour, sector by sector, and unit by unit. The horror and the heroism are driven home through the recounted experiences of numerous veterans. Three brief and superficial chapters on Gold, Juno and Sword are tacked on at the end almost as an afterthought. Perhaps it would have been fairer to omit these altogether rather than offer the few, often unrepresentative incidents and debatable generalisations which do little service to America's Allies. This part of the story should be told by someone who has the motivation to do it justice."
1,deeply biased and misleading: avoid!,"Any account that perpetuates the untruth (shared by some of the book's reviewers, apparently)that d-day was mainly a US affair, and US led, with the US troops doing the lion share is insulting to all that took part, GIs included. And stupid. Yet that is what Ambrose does. Some facts: D day and the battle of Normandy were fought by about 50-50 US and UK/Canadian forces(incl some other nationalities); the attack and campaign was planned and led by Montgomery (a British general). It succeeded. UK/Canadian forces held down the bulk of the German forces. Then the US made the break out in the west. The best army was probably the German one. Clear? clear. Read Robin Neillands 'Battle of Normandy' for the best account, not Ambrose's feeble bit of nationalism."
2,Propaganda and patriotism,"After 100 first pages I had to stop reading this book forever. The awesomeness and courage of US soldiers is described in a way that makes non-US reader sick. There are nice stories and facts, but Ambrose's Patriotism and gush is too much. Shouldn't history writers even try to be objective?"
5,Great,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Very detailed, very interesting and a rather quick read. The wealth of information is staggering as are the personnal accounts of that day. Recollections by veterans are priceless. A sobering reminder of the price of freedom, a price we will be called upon to pay from time to time..."
5,gripping account of a momentous event in history,"This is a gripping account of the D-Day landings from the first glider drop of the British Airborne Division at 0016 hours to the sad reflections of Eisenhower standing on Omaha Beach twenty years later. Ambrose strikes a fine balance between technical information and the personal recollections of the ordinary soldiers who came through the ordeal. For this reason, the book is very readable despite its length. The description of the Omaha Beach landings creates a real impact. Like many others, I'm sure, I was inspired to read this book after seeing Saving Private Ryan but if anything this creates an even more vivid image than the film. Of the many anecdotes, perhaps the most memorable describes a momentary ceasefire during the battle for a coastal village while an old woman wandered down the street quite oblivious to the chaos around her. No sooner had she departed than the violence erupted again. Astonishing."
5,"Not so much a pleasing book, but very neccesary.","Ambrose obviously wasn't going out to shock and entertain when he wrote this book, which is fine by me. I read it to find out what I missed when wathcing the history channel and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, as well as the LONGEST DAY. It tells very precise facts and real life stories that explain why and how it all went down. Unless youre REALLY into the who WWII thing, it will be a hard and long read. But in the end, the information you recieve will be well worth it."
5,"detailed,accurate,gut wrenching","Unarguably, in my opinion, the best book ever written about D Day. One actually feels the sense of danger and hopelessness of trying to get ashore on Omaha. The personal interviews really bring home the magnitude of this operation."
1,Putting the Record Straight,"Ambrose described an alleged incident on Omaha Beach in which a Captain Zappacosta threatened the British coxswain of his landing craft with a pistol in order to make him move closer inshore. Private Robert Sales, the only survivor of that landing craft has since stated that this was a complete invention. It never happened. Sales, who was angered by the allegation, challenged Ambrose in person and asked him to correct it but the writer just brushed it off. There is much more in this vein - Ambrose rarely missed an opportunity to disparage America's Allies. If this is representative of the standard of his research, then this book should be treated with extreme caution. His sections on the Anglo-Canadian contribution to D-Day are in any case lamentably brief. This is just bad history. There are many excellent works about D-Day, but this isn't one of them."
4,"Great story, okay writing....","As a writer of popular history, Mr. Ambrose may be no James McPherson (Battle Cry of Freedom), but he certainly has a contagious passion for his subject. I only wish his writing ability was a bit stronger. Starting paragraphs with ""Anyway,.."" and tiresome use of the passive tense makes this battle epic curiously static. The book only comes alive when the vets speak for themselves. Maybe a book that was completely an ""oral history"" would have been more effective.Another annoyance was Ambrose's intermittent injection of himself into the text. Biased dismissals of other historical perspectives as simply ""wrong"" without really making a concrete case for himself was bothersome. And, quite frankly, Mr. Ambrose's unwavering idol worship of Ike made me wonder what other distortions were incorporated into the text.Overall, however, this is a thorough account of a major event in our century, written by an undisputed expert on the subject."
5,I'll never look at a WWII veteran the same way!!,"My initial interest in this book was prompted by my overall interest in WWII. I never knew the horror experienced and courage displayed by my parents and relatives who served during that terrible time. Mr. Ambrose puts together a compelling book full of horrifying events, incredible courage, and genuine humor. The reader has to wonder many times during the book ""what would I have done?"", ""would I have made it through alive?"" Thanks to others, my generation can only wonder in awe and thank God we don't have to answer those questions in the field of battle."
2,D-Day was not the climactic battle of WW2,"I have problems with the title of this book - right off the bat it is propaganda which completely distorts the history of WW2. Stalingrad, Stalingrad, Stalingrad- this was the climactic battle of the war- simply - no Soviet victory at Stalingrad, no D-Day, possibly no more Western-style ""democracy"". Stalingrad was a D-Day battle a day for five months and the Soviets lost more killed in this one battle than the U. S. did in the whole war. Stephen Ambrose is eloquent but he is basically a propagandist with a very specific point of view. His is the history of the conquerer, and now that the Soviet Union is no longer with us this Ambrosian version of WW2 will prevail. History belongs to those who are winning."
2,Image over substance,"With all the inaccuracies and plagiarism charges leveled at Ambrose, one has to wonder how much of this book to believe. And recollections so many years later, which form the essence of the book, can not be substantiated. So, it might be better to think of this as a work of fiction rather than fact. Plus it's heavily biased toward the American side, as widely noted. And it lacks much of a historical perspective. Still, it's fascinating and can easily be read in a day."
1,Lets America Down,I think the most disappointing thing about this book is that by focusing on US forces to the exclusion of others Ambrose insults not just other Allied forces but their American comrades as well who I am sure would be shocked and embarrassed by the treatment of their allied comrades.
4,Good,This was the first book I read about D-Day and I found it to be quite good. Easy to read. Flowed nicely. Full of information. Would recommend it.
5,well written,This book covers the struggles and the bravery of the men who had to face the terrible odds of that day with an insight I had not read before.
3,What's so great about England?,"I've started the book but all I get is that the English army did this and the english army did that. Also the English prime minister Churchill spoke about this and that, the English won battles and lost battles. The same situation happens with the american army and the american soldiers.The facts are that the English army does not exist any more since 1707 and there is no English prime minister. Since the union of parlaments, England, Scotland, Wales and Nothern Ireland have been called GREAT BRITAIN and this new country has a british army and a british prime minister. Infact it would be nice to notice that not only english men died in the war but also brave scotish, welsh and soldiers from Northern Ireland too!And what about the americans? Well, maybe I shouldn't teach a Univerity professor of New Orleans about the difference between America and United States...Anyway it is a nice book to read and the germans are really shown as the bad boys!The same"
3,Captivating book... but a little too American,"The book gives quite a detailed account of the preparation for D-Day and of the battle itself. Particularly well documented are the personal accounts that Ambrose has spread throughout the book.Sadly however, it is written with an extremely American bias. It is a shame that Ambrose discounts the impact that the British, Canadians and others had during the invasion by glossing over their contribution during the final chapters. It seems as though Ambrose pushes for the case that the American's were not only the deciding factor - which I and most others can agree to - but the only factor in the outcome of the invasion."
2,A bit biased toward American effort and Eishenhower,"I was left with a disappointed feeling after reading the book. There was not much structure in the book, as far as I can see. Eishenhower and Rommel comparison and the details of there personal life are useless. It would have better if some information could be shed on Monty and Bradley roles in this particular battle. There is hardly any mention of the British and Canadian role, even there landing maps, and progress maps are missing. There are hardly any details from the German side. Could have given a chapter on how the battle progressed. The personal histories are too fragmented to be of any use. Overall I feel that the author has tried to deliver a book which captures both the personal side of the battle, and the historical side; and has failed to do either."
5,"A Vivid, Emotional Account","This is a truly incredible account of the D-Day invasion. This book covers everything from planning to execution to dealing with all the wounded and dead. Stephen Ambrose's passion for what he is writing about is quite evident in the way he makes the reader feel for everyone involved in the most important battle of our time. I felt the excitement in my stomach and clinched my fist when I read of Dwight D Eisenhower giving the ""Let's Go"" to proceed with the invasion. The decisions made for this invasion had thousands of lives at stake and Ambrose doesn't let the reader forget it."
5,This is required reading for students of World War II,"Like many of Ambrose's books, I found this one hard to put down until I finished it. And it reads so wonderfully. This book is a must for anyone who wants to know more about D-Day. I would put this book right in between Ryan's ""Longest Day"" and the more military college texts like D'Este's ""Decision in Normandy,"" because it does more than scratches the surface but makes tactics and the often dizzying amount of info on a major campaign more understandable without requiring the reader to be Student of the art of warfare. I thoroughly enjoyed its pro-American slant, especially in a field that tends to be pro-British or pro-German. ""Ham and Jam, Ham and Jam!"""
5,This book is AWESOME!,"This book is awesome. I am 12 years old and at first when I got it , it was so thick I didn't think I would be able to read it all. But, once I started reading it, I was addicted to it. I couldn't put it down.This book is DA BOMB!"
2,Narrative with big holes,"I liked his use of the soldier's point of view. But, all in all, a big disappointment. He didn't make good use of the maps to tell the story. For that matter, there should have been more maps.The unpardonable thing was the way he treated what happened on the British and Canadian beaches, all of which got a couple of small chapters at the end. It was almost as if saying, oh, by the way, there were some Brits around who landed on a couple of beaches."
3,"Good Read, Average History","For those familiar with the Stephen Ambrose Method, D-Day is nothing new. The same Amero-centric Pop-historical style present in earlier works replicates itself in this slightly watered-down account of how the US Army single-handedly won the war in Europe - little mention is made of the allies or even the other US services. Nevertheless, if you are not overly familiar with military history, or just want to enjoy several evenings of good wartime anecdotes, you could do worse. Copious amounts of research have resulted in a work eminently readable, but containing little true analysis - this is unfortunate, as it is analysis that differentiates a true history from mere chronology.Summary: well written, possibly a good general background book, but not the definitive work on the subject. Advanced readers should stick with Cornelius Ryan. Three stars."
5,Wonderful history of D-Day,I found this book to be a real page turner. The stories of the men involved made it feel as if you were there on D-Day. Definitely recommended for anyone who wants to learn about D-Day.
4,a fantastic description of d-day 1944,"ambrose is able to deliver every detail without boring you. this book uses direct interviews of the participants to show its point. very patriotic, but gives insight to both sides."
5,The One Book About D-Day to Own,"As an Army veteran (of the Vietnam era), if I were to have only book on the most important battles of WWII and perhaps the greatest battle of the millenium -- this would be it. The chapter on Omaha beach should be required reading for every American citizen. This book does not glorify war, but it underscores the heroic effort required to establish the peace that we enjoy even unto this day."
4,"Excellent commentary, a great read!",If you have any interest in the D-Day Invasion this is the book to read. Ambrose's compilation of oral historys makes the book come alive. I read it on the way to visit Normandy in '94. Don't miss it.
4,"Extremely informative, but...","...Ambrose gets a little too sappy at the end. Yes, these men were awfully brave, but I could figure that out for myself. Eisenhower's words at the end of the book say far more than the author's about the GIs' courage and will. All the same, Ambrose is a very readable historian, something we're seeing a lot more of today. His reliance on the oral histories of men on both sides makes for an informative, enjoyable read. With 'Private Ryan' fresh in a lot of peoples' minds, this offers a side the movie doesn't show: namely tales of the paratroopers and what happened once the GIs got to the top of the bluffs at Omaha Beach."
1,An Insult To Veterans,"This book is a lazy piece of flag waving, not in any sense an account of historical fact. Nobody reading this would realise for example that most of the Allied troops involved on D Day were not American. The American GIs sacrifice on D Day was genuinely heroic and should be honoured. This kind of nationalistic propaganda insults their memory. Mr Ambrose should stick to the facts if he wants to be taken seriously as a historian. Try reading ""Overlord"" by Max Hastings instead."
3,Another D-Day book,Another type of D-Day book which is heavily dependent on interviews from many veterans but unlike in Ryan's Longest Day many of them only appear in the text with very brief descriptions of what they did. Although some others claim their is much bias on the part of the author it seems that he is trying to cram too much into too little space resulting in accounts that are to abbreviated.
1,Fake review under a false name.,"Earlier this year a deliberately foolish review was posted on this site, seemingly sent in by a person with a Princeton email address. This review was in fact written by myself, in an irresponsible and unkind attempt to play a 'joke' on a friend. All reaction to this review should be addressed to me at the above address. I apologise for the considerable hurt that I caused."
4,Full circle,"Drowning pool is a great band, but this CD, although a good cd in itself, is not quite the caliber that their previous cd's have been. I can't put my finger on what specifically it is about it that makes it less of a cd than the other ones, but I think it may have something to do with the new lead vocals. I will still buy Drowning Pool CDs in the future, but I hope that they try something else next time..."
4,"Oh look, its Soil, should have got this instead of Picture Perfect!!!","I'll be honest. i didn't like drowning pools original vocalist but i did like the music. i thought the first album was annoying, figured the second was going to be a failed comeback attempt since a lost singer is a hard rebound.but i always like soil and heard the singer went to drowning pool. i picked up the new Soil album Picture Perfect ""an average album at best"" a couple weeks ago looking for the sound more like this album.its a good album all the way around, just classic metal. not many new bands can make a album like this any more. i must say i was very impressed with the result. its a new band with a slightly used name, if you like old soil you will like this...its not exactly the same but close. if you like drowning pool....not sure, again wasn't really into them, but from what i heard i think they died with the singer."
3,Does anyone know CPR?,"I'll get right to the point: anyone that gives this album five stars must love anything metal. And I'm not rating it a three because it just isn't Dave Williams (even though Sinner WAS their best album). It might be hard for some to follow Drowning Pool because on each album there has been a different lead vocalist, undoubtedly due to twists of fate in some cases. Dave died; then Jason Jones quit; now, Ryan McCombs is here. But the band's latest album Full Circle isn't all that hot.It's not that the music is bad, but the lyrics and the way that Ryan says them brings things down (""Love x2"", anyone?). ""Enemy"" and ""Duet"" could have been left behind, and ""Shame"" is just that. The only songs that really stand out on here are ""Paralyzed"" and ""37 Stitches"". The cover of ""Rebel Yell"" is pretty decent too, but it's no saving grace. Though the album is called Full Circle, it really feels more like a crescent.Anthony Rupert"
3,"OK, but could be better.","Just bought this book, and it is OK but not what I thought it would be. It is really too small to use for any serious wardrobe work, the 'envelope' in the back is much too small for receipts/clippings of outfits/etc., and the structure is a bit too inflexible for real wardrobe planning/changing. I bought it to replace the 3-ring binder that I use for my wardrobe, but it just can't do that much. Guess I'll keep the binder, and use this for little things related to wardrobe & clothing."
1,Don't bother,"A waste of money, this is nothing more than a blank notebook. I was extremely disappointed, and I would give it no stars if I could. Just rubbish! That's how ""authors"" make money."
3,Maghreb Muslim Women,"""The Production of the Muslim Woman: Negotiating Text, History, and Ideology"" by Lamia Ben Youssef Zayzafoon"", paperback & hardback (2005), 213 pgs. The author opines that there is no generic Muslim woman. The author focuses upon French colonial and postcolonial influences on Muslim women living in the Maghreb (northern Africa) region. One reviewer (Schirin Amir-Moazami) contends that Zyazafoon's Muslim women do not exist ""outside of constructions and that these constructions are always linked with, and even based on, mechanisms of power operating at intersections of race, nation, gender, class, and religion"" - something Amir-Moazami believes are frequently similar to those espoused by Edward Said his book: ""Orientalism"". [See her review in: ""Journal of Middle East Women's Studies"", Volume 5, Number 1, Winter 2009; pp. 94-97.]"
4,It does Soothe as Advertsed,"My daughter bought this for me from the local Health Food Store. When an outbreak of IBS hits, this is a product that seems to calm things down. It doesn't completely stop the discomfort, but it does settle things down and shortens the length of the siege. I just bought a new bottle, so obviously it does help. If you have IBS, you have my sympathies."

2,Informative? Yes. Dry? Yes.,"There is no argument Jamieson knows her stuff. The problem is this book reads like a textbook. Interesting at points, yet not a real ""page turner."""
5,Awesome!!,"This toy is very fun for kids and adults. Great way to pass time when traveling, in waiting rooms, etc. Great gift too!"
2,History or opinion?,"If you want to read a book about a historical event with alot of unjustified opinions, this is the book for you. It was the perfect example to show my children how history is changed or added to by the opinion of an author. She even hints that the man, who worked his entire adult life to finance his dream, didn't deserve the money and awards that came with the discovery. She hints that Henson, who was paid very well and at one time didn't even want to return to the Artic, somehow deserved the money and awards. This is just a few examples included in a book that could have been good if she had stuck to the facts instead of HER opinions. I gave it 2 stars for the photographs only."
1,native plants for southwestern landscapes,Not a complete list of plants and the pictures were too small. the descriptions were just adequate. the print was also too small for the visually impaired.
2,false info,The information in this book on many of the plants listed in it is incorrect. If you try to use the names given you will not be able to find them. Cross referece is a must if you intend to use this book in the buisness.
5,Company discontinued product!!!!!,This was the best cleanser for the face. I had used it for 30 years since I was a teenager. Noxema discontinued it claiming lack of sales. Total crap. There is no product close to it. Noxema needs to bring it back ASAP!!
3,"Missionaries and Monsters, miniature but a must","A small but interesting book. I would liked to have seen a few more illustrations. I have been reading Cryptozoology books since I was a kid, and it seems like this book would be better for younger people to peak their interest in cryptozoology."
3,a few problems,"even though the book did have quite a few nice accounts of cryptid encounters, i had a few problems with the writer. i guess the biggest problem i had is that he doesnt look at a lot of these things from a scientific point of view, but from a religious perspective. he says in the book that he beieves that god created men and dinosaurs at the same time, i find that kind of contradictory for a cryptozoologist because a lot of cryptids are fascinating because they have survived for millions of years without us noticing. if we were all created at the same time, then the coelacanth(one of the most amazing modern animal discoveries) would be no different from a goldfish, and mokele-mbembe would just be some big beast that we havent yet found instead of being an amazing animal who may have survived hidden for millions of years, if you are just interested on the accounts, without looking for the authors oppinion, then you may find this book pretty good"
4,if size matters...,"I've used this brand of B-complex before (the bottle says ""tablets"" but they are more like ""caplets""). I just ordered these ""softgels"" for my son, and was surprised to find they are about the size and shape of our fish oil capsules (large). I guess I was thinking they would be smaller, not larger, than the tablets/caplets because they wouldn't need fillers/binders. If you have trouble swallowing large oblong pills, these may not work for you."
5,One of the best,This was my first book on Tarot. I now own several and still use this one quite often. I highly recommend this book for all beginners.
2,Poor Condition,Book arrived with a warped cover. It had either been damp or crushed by something. The contents were great and exactly like expected.
4,Cheerios book for toddlers,"The book arrived in great condition and in a timely manner.My granddaughter loves to read it, inserting and then eating! the Cheerios.Yes, I realize it is an incentive (read advertisement) to have Cheerios on hand,but there are worse snacks!"
1,"Cheap, low quality","These are cheap, low quality CDRs. My car stereo has a hard time playing music burned to these discs."
1,16 speed NOT!,"I use Toast with a Sony CDU948S, which is a 4x write CD-R, and these Imation CD-Rs always fail at 4x. Other ""Certified"" CD-Rs allways work."
4,Same as Kingston Hypermedia,"Turns out these are made in the same factory (CMC Taiwan) using the same process as the Kingston CD's. Usually the Kingstons are cheaper, so check them out. Anyway they both are relatively good quality. Perhaps Fujis or TDKs would last longer, I don't know, but I never had a problem with these."
3,Leap of Faith,"me bought I a 50 pack but me haven't tried them yet. After reading the 2 bad reviews written before I, me decided that I(Me)mation CD-R's are unreliable. However, since there are also a couple of positive reviews on the me-dia, me opted to go ahead and try these babies out. Me-anwhile, me have tentatively awarded the product 3 stars. Here goes I's leap of faith... wish I luck!"
5,"Bob's book is invaluable, but the Journal makes it REAL!","When I bought Bob Green's book ""Make the Connection,"" I bought the companion journal as well. The information in Bob's book, as well as Oprah's inspirational thoughts, was fantastic. But it was the Journal that really made it real, made it personal to ME. With Bob's help, I did something I never thought I'd do. I started working out in the morning before work. To supplement the exercise, I carried the Journal with me every day to work, documenting what I was eating, what my emotions were, how much water I drank, etc. Words cannot express how important the Journal was to me. It not only gave structure to my efforts, but it showed me patterns of stress eating and such that I could not have identified as clearly without the Journal. Thank you!"
5,A journal of daily renewal,This is by far the best work-out journal I have ever used.I love the ease of just checking off how many fruits and veggies you have had for the day or glasses of water you have consumed. You do not have to wtrite everything out. It really is layed out well.At the end of the week it gives you a spot to reflect back on the week.Plenty of room for to write out all your thoughts.
5,It kept me focused on me,"Buying this journal was a big step, I didn't want to admit in writing how much I was eating and how it made me feel. It helped me so much. It made me aware of how much I was overeating and how the extra weight made me depressed. When I started to re-read my journal entries I realized IF I didn't overeat I wouldn't be depressed!! The journal was my daily reminder of my personal goal and it made the ""Ten Steps"" to my transformation very simple."
2,Doesn't bite but has no snap,"12 DAYS OF TERROR starring John Rhys-Davies..a reasonable though with mostly average script, direction and unfortunate cgi...little Discovery channel TV film about the true story of the killer shark that attacked New Jersey in 1916 and eventually made its way up a river and invaded the small town of Matewan. It could have been better.......and should have been but it is also not at all bad either. There is more than one scene of genuine terror and the shark attacks are well done. Woodrow Wilson even shows up to add to the general sense of unease. A decent time passer."
4,12 days of terror,i enjoyed this movie. i thought it would be scary but it did not terrorize me or keep me awake after i watched it. it was based on true events that happened in the early 1900's about some shark attacks that happened in the east coast. the characters were played well by colin egglesfield & john rhys-davies.
3,B movie that is okay.,It was omay. Just very dry for a shark attack movie that was based on a true story. Acting was B movie quality.
2,No Jaws Here,"Ok, so this is suppose to be the event that inspired the epic classic ""JAWS"", well, it is a true event, however, it is rather lame. The story lacked direction, the acting was sub par, the story line was more of a love story than anything else and the ture ""star"" of the movie was not the shark. There are some moments when the movie shines, but they are few and far between and quickly forgotten. Stick to the original ""JAWS"" movie, or even the lame sequels, they are much better than this one. One thing I can recommend, is it will put you to sleep."
2,A True B Movie,"Wow, talk about a perfect example of a ""B"" movie. The story is fairly interesting but the execution is dull and the acting is poor. The fisherman character is laughable; he's a live version of the cartoon ""Sea Captain"" from The Simpsons television series. This movie is not the worst that's been made but overall it's lackluster and dull."
5,A great little book!,"I love this book. The art work is beautiful, the pages are the durable plastic-type material that is very difficult to rip (good for the age group for which it's intended), there are several examples of words beginning with each letter, and it's child-size. Very nice book. Highly recommended."
5,Great microfiber cloths - professional results,"Guy that details my p-car turned me on to these. Outstanding quality and I love the results: no streaks, no lint - just clear coat shine. Highly recommend."
3,"Good product, but needs improvment","I'm a fan of and own a ton of Lisle specialty tools. This tool is well made, however, I believe that the covers over the clamps are too thick and stiff. During its first use, in a very cold garage, I had to pull back the covers to use the clamps.I like the compact size as it takes up very little space in my tool box, unlike the silly pistol-grip switches that I've seen in auto part stores."
2,So so. Uninspiring.,"Disjointed, wondering, and uninspiring. I could not get involved with this one. Great actors in an overly negative screenplay. Fun to watch her walk around on screen as usual."
3,Bit of a mischief,"Just a warning to mind the aspect ratio: the only time you see this movie in the advertised 1:66 ratio is in the brief clips illustrating the Fuentes interview. The feature itself is full-screen 4x3 - which is how it was originally issued, according to IMDB.com.The 'wide' clips are actually cropped (top & bottom) versions of the 4x3."
3,Mediocre examination of American horror film,"Perhaps I was expecting too much from this film but I eagerly picked it up on the day it came out, hoping for a profound statement of the evolution of American Cinema and horror's piece in it. Sadly, the documentary never delivers. While it attempts to cover a great deal of cinema in a short time, the film never really says anything new or interesting. We lack a lot of the in dept interviews and commentary that we saw in ""American Nightmares"" and to be quite frank, the film makers chose some fairly standard clips to show. They never really went into indy cinema or even into lesser known films. Not a bad watch but also not something that I would recommend."
4,Informative but Not for Kids,"I enjoyed learning about American horror films, but as a teacher, I'm a bit disappointed that I can't show it to my students because of the nudity."
2,Bizarre but interesting mess.,This whole thing is a mess...I liked the footage..but it all seemed to be some kind of political statement. There was very little horror and more about a very hippie point of view of America. It was half enjoyable..but politics and navel gazing seemed to get in the way..so it is what it is..but it was lame for me.
5,A must read for all who are single!,I really enjoyed this book. This is now one of my favorite books. It helped me to refocus my view of my status in life as a Single Adult. It helped me to develop a renewed desire to know God better. It reminded me that I am important to Him - JUST AS I AM - SINGLE. My hat is off to Michael Cavanaugh whom God gave the ability to communicate these concepts to people so appropriately. What are you waiting for? Read the book!
4,God's Call Gives Good Approach to Singleness,"Cavanaugh's book has valuable insights and a solid, pragmatic approach to the subject. My only complaint is that it can get a little redundant at times. I used it as a resource for a 6 week study with a small group and it was generally well received."
4,This book is worth reading if you are interested in Biological warfare and germs,"This book explains how germs become immune to different medicines. It gives many examples of diseases and many possibilities to what the future may have in store for us. Unfortunatly, everything in this book is true so all of the stories of diseases that killed thousands of people were not fiction. During the time of these diseases, the correct vaccines and antibiotics were unknown so many people and animals were killed because of them. Their are many countries working on developing biological weapons but only a few worry the united states because of their past relationship with the US. This book is definently worth reading if you are interested in this kind of stuff."
5,Good Kit,This is a great product for learning how to do 3D games. How ever I wou;d recomend reading sams tech your self C++ in 21 days first. Or some other C++ book. When you get more experinced you can upgrade your programs to a higher version!
1,GOTTA BE SERIOUS,"This is to all the people who actually thinking that if you buy this program it's the ""easy way"" to break into the gaming industry. I mean...get real this kit comes with everything set up for you and no code implementation is necessary. Well WAKE UP AND SMELL THE COFFEE!. In the gaming industry if you want to actually be a game programmer you're going to have to face reality, because nothing is, ""set up"", for you and the people in the industry will want you to program GREAT games from SCRATCH. I advise if you save your money and buy ""C++ How to Program (4th Edition)""by Harvey M. Deitel, Paul J. Deitel. it's not focused on games but hey! it's a solid start."
3,Parts needed,there is parts which need to replace once a yearphotocatalitic lampbut amazon did not sell ityou can find it here[...]l
5,Lama Chants is wonderful.,"I am so happy with the product I purchased, (Lama Chants.)It is exactly what I expected and in perfect condition.Thank you Amazon."
3,Not what I was hoping for...,"This just wasn't what I was looking for. I wish I had taken the time to listen to the sample tracks, but a slow dial-up connection and the Grammy nomination made me skip that step. The voice is way too guttural for my liking...it just doesn't feel calming, peaceful or meditative to me. I would definitely recommend listening to the sample tracks and making your own decision before buying."
3,"For me, hard to listen to...","Unfortunately, I think my expectations for this cd were way off. While admirable, I find the deep, gutteral chants ear and bone rattling, and as such virtually unlistenable. I was expecting these chants to be relaxing and soothing, but they are quite the opposite, to my ear. I guess I'm more suited to the more melodic(?) types of chants that I've heard in the past.Please don't flame me. Everyone's opinion counts. I listened to some samples, and thought that maybe I should try it before judging. I bought this cd with the best of intentions and based on listener feedback.I'm sure I am missing the point of the type of chants in this cd, as I am not an expert or Buddhist practitioner, so I'll give it three stars out of respect."
4,Chants for Life and well being,I am listening and chanting to this CD everyday before beginning the day and before retiring at night. It helps with meditation and helps with the correct pronunciation of the tibetan mantra. I've listened to many different chanting CD's but this is the most entrancing and powerful chanting CD thus far.Lama Tashi's 'overtone' chanting is very deep and combined with the text can be followed very easily for every deity.
5,There is such beauty in this book,"The photographs are stunning and the message clear and compelling. To the person who reviewed this and called Pat Derby and Ed Stewart hypocrits, you really missed the point. They have provided an amazing sanctuary for these animals and others. They do not promote keeping animals in capitivity, they simply are caring for those that are unfortunetly, already captive. They are providing a wonderful place for them to iive out their lives with the hopes that there will not be a need in the future to provide sanctuary for any others, though sadly, that seems to be only a dream."
1,Don't be fooled,"This is a book full of pictures of elephants, NOT a Peter S. Beagle book. He wrote a few paragraphs of an introduction, nothing else. In terms of the rest of the book, it is bland and hypocritical; the authors bemoan the fact of captive elephants, while keeping captive elephants. The pictures are poor quality as well."
4,Good. kids- 4 star adults-3 star,"Written in diary for this book explains the life of an Irish immigrant. I do not usually read this style of book but I must say it is quite an interesting read. It has allot of facts and would be sure help on a report. It is a short book and a refreshing change from other fats moving, action packed, and depressing books of today. (even though i do enjoy those types of books best) it is on the childish side though i suppose many older women will enjoy them. If you are just looking for a rainy-day book I guess i suggest it. For kids it is a four star for adults it is a three star."
4,Nice,"The music is great and relaxing with a nice mix of Latin and Japanese vocals. Her voice is great. The last track is more upbeat than the rest of them, providing for a nice change of tempo."
1,Emotionally uninvolving,"The story of a brief romance between the opera singer Enrico Caruso and a Chinese-mulatta Cuban woman, Aida Petrirena Cheng, narrated by their illegitimate daughter. The romance is doomed because Caruso is only making a short tour in Cuba, he's married, the Sicilian Black Hand is making death threats, and he may be seriously ill (the last I never figured out).The story is presented like a tragic opera. Unfortunately, although competently written the book is emotionally uninvolving throughout. The characters, though not stereotyped, never came to life, and neither did the story. It always seemed as though everyone was making much too much of a fuss about everything. So Caruso had a (fictional) fling; what's the big deal?"
5,Short and Sweet,"Sometimes the best things really do come in small packages. It is precisely because of the length that Anna Quindlen's little book was just what I needed. I think this will make a wonderful gift to anyone who is in the hospital, recovering from a traumatic event, or simply taking time to reflect on what's most important in life. It's not just about getting a life, but recognizing how intensely precious the life you have really is. You never know how much the things and people you take for granted are worth until they're gone. Why wait?"
3,"If you've experienced it, you might like this book.","I tend to think that there are two types of audiences for this book. Those who have are looking for a ""user-guide"" on how to experience a happy life, and those who are already happy and are looking for validation on what they feel.""A Short Guide to a Happy Life"" makes for a poor user-guide and leaves the reader wondering what Anna Quindlen was trying to convey.However, the latter of the two groups might identify better with the author and walk away with a renewed sense of serenity."
3,"Good, But where is the rest of it????","I honestly read this book in 10 minutes. It was the quickest, book I've read in years... It teaches us all about life's important lessons, and things we should hold dear. There was one problem. It was toooo short..."
4,much to think about,This is a very short book that can be read quickly. But it is worth reading. The author makes some very good points about how a persons mindset affects them emotionally. I think I have some pointed thinking to do about how I can incorporate those ideas into my own life and be more positive.
1,Expensive fluff,"I was terribly disappointed by ""A Short Guide to a Happy Life."" An avid Anna Quindlen fan, I bought it with huge anticipation and brought it to a restaurant lunch by myself where I could savor it. But I was halfway through the book before I realized I wasn't reading the introduction; in fact, I was reading the book itself. Wah! I finished it before the end of the meal, and I was still hungry on both counts.Save your money and read it at the bookstore."
2,Disappointing,"I have always liked Anna Quindlen's writing, but this book was truly disappointing. There is not much more to this tiny book than ""you should get a life, and appreciate it."" Over half the pages are unoriginal stock photos (and black and white at that).If you want a little book filled with truly thought-provoking advice on living a happy life, I highly recommend ""Open Your Mind, Open Your Life"" by Taro Gold."
3,Not new news,"Anna Quindlen has hit the nail in the head with her essay. Unfortunately, she peppers her prose with every platitude that's ever been applied to the subject.I just wish she'd used more of her own words, rather than the many ""quotable quotes"" that make up most of the insights in the book."
3,Short It Is.,It gives you a good feeling when you are reading it (Concentrated word-by-word reading shouldn't take more than 15 Minutes). But the text doesn't have enough emotions to pull you to read it again and again.
3,Reads like a graduation commencement speech,"This book reads like a graduation commencement speech. It is short, sweet and to the point. Its message is clear, ""Live life while you have the chance, for it will be over all too soon!"" The book is so short that it can be read in just one sitting and has many fun photos to go along with the text."
4,Would Make a Great Graduation Gift,"Short and sweet. Very sweet. Words of wisdom simply put and a pleasure to read. With a variety of stock, black and white photos, it's a lovely overall package and I believe it would make a nice graduation gift for high school seniors and college grads.Thank you Anna Quindlen.Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said."
1,Recycled Psycho Pop Goop,"I skimmed this at a bookstore and it took me six minutes flat. I wasn't even finished with my coffee. Amazing, now Anna Quindlen is the new New Age queen, offering the most silly fluff that has been said before, and even stock photography which everyone has seen on Hallmark greeting cards. This is rip-off city. Some of the reviewers said it makes a good gift, but there are much better ""little"" books out there than this silly thing."
1,A good column not a good book,"I ordered this book from Amazon and felt ripped off when I read it. It was like reading a hallmark card. It would have been a great column. Also, the photographs which were great, had no real credits. You could not identify when they were taken or by whom. This was such a disappointment from Quinlan."
1,The Giant Sucking Sound Didn't Come From Mexico...,"That giant sucking sound Ross Perot referred to as coming from Mexico is actually at your neighborhood bookstore! Just buy Anna's new book and you'll hear a whooosh! as money flies into the pockets of people who are really enjoying life -- on your dime.Hah! Here's my summary review:- Better photos in Victoria's Secret (and it's free).- More serenity from raking my 6 inch square zen garden.- Better life lessons from ""The Weakest Link""- Not as compelling as ""Goodnight Moon""If you must -- read it at the bookstore and use a buck or two on 10-10-220 to phone a friend and warn them."
4,An Ode to Life,"Anna Quindlen's book reads like a poem. It is fluid and sweet and beautiful to look at. You can read it aloud, and over and over, carry it everywhere, and dream between pages of people and places that you love and have loved. It is a little Ode to Life, reminding us of the beauty that surrounds us and inviting us to learn to appreciate it, celebrate it, and share it, in each moment of now.There is another book dealing with the theme of ""living in the moment"" that has touched me very much called Working on Yourself Doesn't Work by Ariel and Shya Kane. If you are interested in learning, as Ms. Quindlen says, ""to love the journey, not the destination"" check out the Kane's book also. It has introduced me to the concept of living in the moment, and it may have some keys for you too."
2,Disappointing,"I like Anna Quindlen, but this book was dissapointing. I can't imagine why it's been successful other than brilliant marketing and the author's good name. Perhaps I just expected too much, but there is not much more to this little book than ""you should get a life, and appreciate it."" Over half the pages are taken up by unoriginal stock photos.If you want a little book filled with truly thought-provoking advice on living a happy life, I highly recommend ""Open Your Mind, Open Your Life"" by Taro Gold."
1,This is a non-book,"This isn't a little book, this isn't a short book, it's a non-book. This is just a random string of thoughts off the top of someone's head, and not very good thoughts either. I have a hard time believing Anna wrote this herself. Totally unoriginal. No new material here you can't find in a get-well card, or on a mediocre TV talk show... Ricky Lake is more profound than this fluff. Save yourself the money! At least if you're foolish enough to buy it, you will finish reading it in less than 10 minutes (even if you're a slow reader) so the pain will be over soon."
1,A shockingly trite entry by Anna Quindlen,"I am surprised that Anna Quindlen wrote this very short book, and probably made money on it. There is nothing new here, nothing surprising, nothing that leads me to a happier life. In fact, Quindlen uses so many old sayings that I'm surprised she didn't footnote. This might have been an excellent book if Quindlen had made it into more than 50 pages (including sappy photos that have no context). The story of the death of her mother might have been a fantastic non-fiction book. But this is no little gem. It's a waste of time and a waste of money. Liking Anna Quindlen's work as I do, I was really surprised. Don't bother buying this book."
3,More like a commencement address. How did this become a brook?,"I really like this collection of thoughts by novelist Anna Quindlen. It's homey, good advice for living. But...how could this become a book? At least half of this very, very slim book is photos. The rest? Life is short. Life is good. Live well. Yada yada.But a hard cover book!?"
1,Nothing but cliches,"This book has nothing new or original to say. It is simply a collection of cliches and another proof that low quality writing can still come from recognized authors. It may only be 50 pages long. But, the whole book can really be summed up with ""once in a while, stop and smell the roses"". So, just save your dollar."
2,Reverse the adjectives?,"The author assures that she has few qualifications to advise anyone on life--and clearly means it. After a few pages it is more clear she wishes to, in fact, completely convince us. Many readers will feel that the book would have been greatly improved if it could have had the adjectives in the title reversed. But on its own terms it is a masterpiece, and will divert many on the subway who read it from a life of crime or unseemly public yawning."
1,WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?,"i BOUGHT THIS LATEST, PER THE GREAT REVIEWS AND KNOWLEDGE OF HER PREVIOUS WRITING GREATS. eXREMELY DISAPPOINTING, TO SAY THE LEAST. A LOT OF HOO HAH OVER NOTHING BUT A LOT OF POSTER PHILOSOPHY SAID BY SO MANY BEFORE, AND OFTEN BETTER. I KNOW MANY WHO COULD HAVE WRITTEN THE SAME LITTLE TOMB WITH THE SAME ADVICE GIVEN.........HER NAME SOLD IT BUT NOT THE CONTENT......I HOPE SHE GETS BACK TO FICTION LAND SOON AND OUT OF COUNSELOR LAND......"
3,Short is the operative word!,"I always love reading anything by Anna Quindlen. She has a great style and a wisdom about life that I really appreciate. I can relate to so much of what she writes. So why did I give this book 3 stars? Because 2 means I didn't like it and I DID like it. It was a very good essay.....but it WASN'T a book, and certainly not worth the $11.99 that I paid for it. I read it 3 times. The first time, my husband was hospitalized and I took the ""book"" to the cafeteria. I started it, and finished it while I ate eggs and hashbrowns. The second time, I read it before falling asleep and the third time, I timed myself. It took exactly 8 minutes to read. I would have been very happy to purchase this essay and enjoy the photos for a smaller sum. I just feel that the brevity did not justify the price."
2,"Yep, It's Short","I borrowed this ebook from my local public library and read it on my Kindle.While I found some of the text inspiring, it was so short - 218 locations, most of which come in the form of photos - that I never felt I sank into it.Would I read more by this author? Not sure. This wasn't enough to help me decide."
3,Commencement Speech in Book Form,"This is a very quick read, full of advice like (paraphrasing) take in the view, leave the office, life's about the journey--not the destination. Commencement speech material. Nothing new, but I enjoyed the black and white photographs interspersed among the pages of writing."
1,damaging mush,"This should have been entitled ""The things people say to comfort you.""..... you know, the types who grasp your hand with a brimming sense of their wisdom as you bury your child and say ""it will all look better in the morning"" and ""god knows best"" and such. A horrible book to put out there for some unsuspecting soul who might really need a glimpse of a happy life. Apparently this was originally a graduation speech: let's hope those seniors found something more than mush thereafter."
3,"Pause at the photos, once, twice,.....",Don't read this book to gain an insight into leading a meaningful life. Read it when you need to catch a breather between chores and don't be surprised if the wonderful black and white pictures have you smiling to yourself.
1,Disillusioned,"Once an ardent admirer of Anna Quindlen's writing, one true thing is that her pamphlet is a mostly maudlin collection of cliches. I hope that she received permission from those she quoted, yet didn't always credit, for the ""reuse"" of their material. If you really want to know Anna Quindlen, read anything but this."
4,Quick read but great message,"Ok I've got to admit I originally bought this book as a stocking stuffer from a friend. When it arrived I couldn't help but read it first. Yes I was finished in about 10-15 minutes but when I super stressed I often pick it up and read it again. Yes, I did selfishly keep it for myself instead of giving it to my friend. This little book which is definitely short on pages is jammed with message. It's quite the book for introspection."
1,A complete waste of money,"This book was a great disappointment and a complete waste of money. I did not find it motivational, inspirational, or interesting. At one point I thought it sounded like it was imitating that writing that circulated on the Internet as being a commencement address by Kurt Vonnegut. However, that was far superior and I received it for free."
1,"Should be titled ""Short Guide to a Quick Buck""",This is the ultimate case of cashing in on a name. It is nothing more than a long greeting card using hackneyed quotes and second rate photos. Hallmark could put it out for $2.98. So unoriginal it was laughable. Might be a good read for a ten year old. But maybe not.
2,A short guide with a long list of cliches,"It seems the publishing industry has found a way to beef up their profits by publishing really short books and selling them at outrageously high prices. This book ...took me all of 8 minuits to read. In this respect it reminded me of ""The prayer of Jabez,"" and ""Secrets of the Vine."" However, this one is even shorter. Not only is is short but it seems the author wrote down every cliche about life that she could think of and tried to squeeze them all into one essay, which is what this book really is. These include such things as ""If you win the rat race, you are still a rat"" and ""Life is a journey not a destination."" If you can think of any others it is probobly in here. In closing the book fails utterly to enlighten. It's real success seems to come not from enlightening the reader, but in lining the pockets of the publisher. Save your money, and spend it on something a little less trite."
